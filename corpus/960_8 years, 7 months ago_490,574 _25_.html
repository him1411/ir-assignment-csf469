Is there a function to extract the extension from a filename?Yes. Use os.path.splitext:To get only text extension One option may be splitting from dot:No error when file doesn\'t have an extension:But you must be careful:I\'m surprised no one has mentioned pathlib yet, pathlib IS awesome!NOTE: Requires Python 3.4 at least.And if you want to get all the suffixes (eg if you have a .tar.gz), .suffixes will return a list of them! Neat!worth adding a lower in there so you don\'t find yourself wondering why the JPG\'s aren\'t showing up in your list.Any of the solutions above work, but on linux I have found that there is a newline at the end of the extension string which will prevent matches from succeeding. Add the strip() method to the end. For example:  With splitext there are problems with files with double extension (e.g. file.tar.gz, file.tar.bz2, etc..)but should be: .tar.gzThe possible solutions are hereSurprised this wasn\'t mentioned yet:Benefits:As function:Another solution with right split:Although it is an old topic, but i wonder why there is none mentioning a very simple api of python called rpartition in this case:to get extension of a given file absolute path, you can simply type:example:will give you:  \'csv\'That will give you the file name up to the first ".", which would be the most common.If you know the exact file extension for example file.txt\nthen you can useprint fileName[0:-4]
