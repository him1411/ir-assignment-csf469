How can I do this in python?I need to have the elements of an array but from the end to the beginning.You can make use of the reversed function for this as:Note that reversed(...) does not return a list. You can get a reversed list using list(reversed(array)).Extended slice syntax is explained well in the Python What\'s new Entry for release 2.3.5By special request in a comment this is the most current slice documentation.Or This is to duplicate the list:This is to reverse the list in-place:For reversing the same list use: To assign reversed list into some other list use:Using slicing, e.g. array = array[::-1], is a neat trick and very pythonistic but a little obscure for newbies maybe, using the reverse() method is a good way to go in day to day coding.However if you need to reverse a list in place as in an interview question, you will likely not be able to use built in methods like these, so the following example might be another way to do it:-Note that this will not work on string sequences because strings are immutable i.e. you cannot write into them to change elements.Possible ways,I find (contrary to some other suggestions) that l.reverse() is by far the fastest way to reverse a long list in Python 3 and 2. I\'d be interested to know if others can replicate these timings.l[::-1] is probably slower because it copies the list prior to reversing it. Adding the list() call around the iterator made by reversed(l) must add some overhead. Of course if you want a copy of the list or an iterator then use those respective methods, but if you want to just reverse the list then l.reverse() seems to be the fastest way.FunctionsListPython 3.5 timingsPython 2.7 timingsUsing reversed(array) would be the likely best route. Should you need to understand how could implement this without using the built in reversed.This should take O(N) time.If you want to store the elements of reversed list in some other variable, then you can use revArray = array[::-1] or revArray = list(reversed(array)).But the first variant is slightly faster:Output:Strictly speaking, the question is not how to return a list in reverse but rather how to reverse a list with an example list name array.To reverse a list named "array" use array.reverse().The incredibly useful slice method as described can also be used to reverse a list in place by defining the list as a sliced modification of itself using array = array[::-1].The most direct translation of your requirement into Python is this for statement:This is rather cryptic but may be useful.You can use reversed()Use the reversed function as follow and print itlist comprehension:[array[n] for n in range(len(array)-1, -1, -1)]You could always treat the list like a stack just popping the elements off the top of the stack from the back end of the list. That way you take advantage of first in last out characteristics of a stack. Of course you are consuming the 1st array. I do like this method in that it\'s pretty intuitive in that you see one list being consumed from the back end while the other is being built from the front end.You can also use the bitwise complement of the array index to step through the array in reverse:Whatever you do, don\'t do it this way.Reversing in-place by switching references of opposite indices:Can be done using __reverse__ , which returns a generator.I think that the best way to reverse a list in python is to do:Job done, now you have a reversed list.
