I want to remove the last character from a string. I\'ve tried doing this:Getting the length of the string - 1 and replacing the last letter with nothing (deleting it), but every time I run the program, it deletes middle letters that are the same as the last letter.For example, the word is "admirer"; after I run the method, I get "admie." I want it to return the word admire.replace will replace all instances of a letter. All you need to do is use substring():Why not just one liner?Full CodeSince we\'re on a subject, one can use regular expressions tooThe described problem and proposed solutions sometimes relate to removing separators. If this is your case, then have a look at Apache Commons StringUtils, it has a method called removeEnd which is very elegant.Example:Would result in:\n"string 1|string 2|string 3"Don\'t try to reinvent the wheel, while others have already written libraries to perform string manipulation: \norg.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.chop()Use this:For example, the word is "admirer"; after I run the method, I get "admie." I want it to return the word admire.In case you\'re trying to stem English wordsStemming is the process for reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form\xe2\x80\x94generally a written word form....A stemmer for English, for example, should identify the string "cats" (and possibly "catlike", "catty" etc.) as based on the root "cat", and "stemmer", "stemming", "stemmed" as based on "stem". A stemming algorithm reduces the words "fishing", "fished", "fish", and "fisher" to the root word, "fish".Difference between Lucene stemmers: EnglishStemmer, PorterStemmer, LovinsStemmer outlines some Java options.As far as the readability is concerned, I find this to be the most conciseThe negative indexes can be used in Apache\'s StringUtils utility.\nAll negative numbers are treated from offset from the end of the string.Look to StringBuilder Class :A one-liner answer (just a funny alternative - do not try this at home, and great answers already given):removes last occurence of the \'xxx\':removes last occurrence of the \'xxx\' if it is last:you can replace the \'xxx\' on what you want but watch out on special charsWhy not use the escape sequence ... !Life is much easier now . XD ! ~ A readable one-linerif you have special character like ; in json just use String.replace(";", "") otherwise you must rewrite all character in string minus the last.This is the one way to remove the last character in the string:Im using this in my code, it\'s easy and simple.\nit only works while the String is > 0.\nI have it connected to a button and inside the following if statement
