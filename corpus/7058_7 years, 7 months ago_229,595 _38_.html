I would like to run JUnit test cases from the command line.\nHow can I do this?For JUnit 4.X it\'s really:But if you are using JUnit 3.X note the class name is different:You might need to add more JARs or directories with your class files to the classpath and separate that with semicolons (Windows) or colons (UNIX/Linux). It depends on your environment.Edit: I\'ve added current directory as an example. Depends on your environment and how you build your application (can be bin/ or build/ or even my_application.jar etc). Note Java 6+ does support globs in classpath, you can do:Hope it helps. Write tests! :-)The answer that @lzap gave is a good solution. However, I would like to add that you should add . to the class path, so that your current directory is not left out, resulting in your own classes to be left out. This has happened to me on some platforms. So an updated version for JUnit 4.x would be:Maven wayIf you use Maven, you can run the following command to run all your test cases:Or you can run a particular test as belowIf you would like to see the stack trace (if any) in the console instead of report files in the target\\surefire-reports folder, set the user property surefire.useFile to false. For example:Ant wayOnce you set up your Ant build file build.xml, you can run your JUnit test cases from the command line as below:You can follow the link below to read more about how to configure JUnit tests in the Ant build file: \nhttps://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/junit.htmlNormal wayIf you do not use Maven or Ant, you can follow the following way:First of all, you need to compile your test cases. For example (in Linux):Then run your test cases. For example:Ensure that JUnit.jar is in your classpath, then invoke the command line runner from the consolejava org.junit.runner.JUnitCore [test class name]Reference: junit FAQWith JUnit 4.12 the following didn\'t work for me:Apparently, from JUnit 4.11 onwards you should also include hamcrest-core.jar in your classpath:In windows it is java -cp .;/path/junit.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestClass [test class name without .class extension]for example: \nc:\\>java -cp .;f:/libraries/junit-4.8.2 org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestSample1 TestSample2 ... and so on, if one has more than one test classes.-cp stands for class path and the dot (.) represents the existing classpath while semi colon (;) appends the additional given jar to the classpath , as in above example junit-4.8.2 is now available in classpath to execute JUnitCore class that here we have used to execute our test classes.Above command line statement helps you to execute junit (version 4+) tests from command prompt(i-e MSDos).Note: JUnitCore is a facade to execute junit tests, this facade is included in 4+ versions of junit.Actually you can also make the Junit test a runnable Jar and call the runnable jar as\njava -jar \n    If your project is Maven-based you can run all test-methods from test-class CustomTest which belongs to module \'my-module\' using next command:Or run only 1 test-method myMethod from test-class CustomTest using next command:For this ability you need Maven Surefire Plugin v.2.7.3+ and Junit 4.\nMore details is here: http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/single-test.htmlPersonally I would use the Maven surefire JUnit runner to do that. Alternatively you can use the following methods in JunitCore class http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/runner/JUnitCore.htmlrun (with Request , Class classes and Runner) or runClasses  from your java file.If you project is ant based then you should be able to do something like this from the console:If this doesn\'t work, but still your project is ant based, you can run ant -p to list the main targets of the project.
