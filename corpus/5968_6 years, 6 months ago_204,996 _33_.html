I am getting the following error: Error assembling WAR: webxml attribute is required (or pre-existing WEB-INF/web.xml if executing in update mode)I have got web.xml in right place which is projectname\\src\\main\\webapp\\WEB-INF\\web.xmlWhat could be causing this?It would be helpful if you can provide a code snippet of your maven-war-plugin.\nLooks like the web.xml is at right place, still you can try and give the location explicitlyThis solution works for me(I was using 2.2 before). Also, I am using Java Based Configuration for Servlet 3.0 and no need to have web.xml file.It works perfectly for me too.The value of my webXml tag needed to look like this in order to work:If you are migrating from XML-based to Java-based configuration and you have removed the need for web.xml by implementing WebApplicationInitializer, simply remove the requirement for the web.xml file to be present.It does look like you have web.xml in the right location, but even so, this error is often caused by the directory structure not matching what Maven expects to see. For example, if you start out with an Eclipse webapp that you are trying to build with Maven.If that is the issue, a quick fix is to create a\nsrc/main/java and a\nsrc/main/webapp directory (and other directories if you need them) and just move your files.Here is an overview of the maven directory layout:\nhttp://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.htmlI had the exact same problem and i solved it like this :Make a new folder named WEB-INF under src/main/webbapp then Right Click on your Project -> Java EE Tools -> Generate Deployment Descriptor StubThis should generate your web.xmlI hope this helps by solving your problem :DIf you change the default project path, you must specify the location of the web.xml file, for example:mvn-war-plugin 2.3 fixes this:This is because you have not included web.xml in your web project and trying to build war using maven. To resolve this error, you need to set the failOnMissingWebXml to false in pom.xml file.For example:Please see the blog for more details: https://ankurjain26.blogspot.in/2017/05/error-assembling-war-webxml-attribute.htmlIt worked for me too.I have had the same error on the test server but not in local. After a few minutes, I discovered that the IDE wasn\'t synchronized with the pom.xml. Here is how I solve it:Make sure pom.xml is placed properly in Project folder. and not inside target folder or any where else. Looks like pom.xml is not relatively aligned.This error occurs because you say Maven to pakage files to war.Do you really needs war? If not, put jar there. \nHere is full code:As per the documentation, it says : Whether or not to fail the build if the web.xml file is missing. Set to false if you want you WAR built without a web.xml file. This may be useful if you are building an overlay that has no web.xml file.\nDefault value is: true.\nUser property is: failOnMissingWebXml.Hope it makes more clearWas your folder structure altered so the file is no-longer at /src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml ?To resolve this issue, I gave my web folder the name webapp and placed it inside the src/main. Maven seems to look for web.xml by default at /src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml. If you do this then you don\'t need to explicitly tell maven where web.xml is. And if you\'ve altered your folder structure and your build recently stopped working, this could be why.Note: This is an old post but the posted solutions don\'t point out why a working build would suddenly stop working.
