This question already has an answer here:Is the a short syntax for joining a list of lists into a single list( or iterator) in python?For example I have a list as follows and I want to iterate over a,b and c.  The best I can come up with is as follows.If you\'re only going one level deep, a nested comprehension will also work:On one line, that becomes:This is known as flattening, and there are a LOT of implementations out there:How about this, although it will only work for 1 level deep nesting:From those links, apparently the most complete-fast-elegant-etc implementation is the following:shortest!This works recursively for infinitely nested elements:Result:Late to the party but ... I\'m new to python and come from a lisp background. This is what I came up with (check out the var names for lulz):Seems to work. Test:returns:What you\'re describing is known as flattening a list, and with this new knowledge you\'ll be able to find many solutions to this on Google (there is no built-in flatten method). Here is one of them, from http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2006/05/10/flattening-lists-in-python/:There\'s always reduce (being deprecated to functools):Unfortunately the plus operator for list concatenation can\'t be used as a function -- or fortunate, if you prefer lambdas to be ugly for improved visibility.A performance comparison:Producing:This is with Python 2.7.1 on Windows XP 32-bit, but @temoto in the comments above got from_iterable to be faster than map+extend, so it\'s quite platform and input dependent.Stay away from sum(big_list, [])Or a recursive operation:Sadly, Python doesn\'t have a simple way to flatten lists.  Try this:Which will recursively flatten a list; you can then doI had a similar problem when I had to create a dictionary that contained the elements of an array and their count. The answer is relevant because, I flatten a list of lists, get the elements I need and then do a group and count. I used Python\'s map function to produce a tuple of element and it\'s count and groupby over the array. Note that the groupby takes the array element itself as the keyfunc. As a relatively new Python coder, I find it to me more easier to comprehend, while being Pythonic as well. Before I discuss the code, here is a sample of data I had to flatten first:It is a query result from Mongo. The code below flattens a collection of such lists.First, I would extract all the "entities" collection, and then for each entities collection, iterate over the dictionary and extract the name attribute. For one-level flatten, if you care about speed, this is faster than any of the previous answers under all conditions I tried.  (That is, if you need the result as a list.  If you only need to iterate through it on the fly then the chain example is probably better.)  It works by pre-allocating a list of the final size and copying the parts in by slice (which is a lower-level block copy than any of the iterator methods):Sorted times list with comments:If you need a list, not a generator, use list():If you meant using "join":print \'\\n\'.join(map(str, listOfLists or listOfTuples))
