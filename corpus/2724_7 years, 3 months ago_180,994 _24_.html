I just need a plain list of conflicted files.Is there anything simpler than:or?I guess I could set up a handy alias for that, however was wondering how pros do it. I\'d use it to write shell loops e.g. to auto-resolve conflict etc.. Maybe replace that loop by plugging into mergetool.cmd?Trying to answer my question:No, there doesn\'t seem to be any simpler way than the one in the question, out of box.After typing that in too many times, just pasted the shorter one into an executable file named \'git-conflicts\', made accessible to git, now I can just:\ngit conflicts to get the list I wanted.Update: as Richard suggests, you can set up an git alias, as alternative to the executableAn advantage of using the executable over the alias is that you can share that script with team members (in a bin dir part of the repo).Here is a fool-proof way: git status displays "both modified" next to files that have conflicts instead of "modified" or "new file", etcyou may hit git ls-files -u on your command line it lists down files with conflictsThis works for me:git grep \'<<<<<<< HEAD\'orgit grep \'<<<<<<< HEAD\' | less -NIf you attempt to commit, and if there are conflicts, then git will give you the list of the currently unresolved conflicts... but not as a plain list. This is usually what you want when working interactively because the list gets shorter as you fix the conflicts.Maybe this has been added to Git, but the files that have yet to be resolved are listed in the status message (git status) like this:Note that this is the Unmerged paths section.I\'ve always just used git status.can add awk at the end to get just the file namesgit status -s | grep ^U | awk \'{print $2}\'slight variation of Charles Bailey\'s answer that gives more information:
