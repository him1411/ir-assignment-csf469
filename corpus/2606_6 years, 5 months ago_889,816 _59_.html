I have a div set to display:block. (90px height and width) and I have some text inside.I need the text to be aligned in the center both vertically and horizontally.I have tried text-align:center, but it doesn\'t do the horizontal part so I tried vertical-align:middle but it didn\'t work.Any ideas?If it is one line of text and/or image, then it is easy to do.  Just usethat\'s it.  If it can be multiple lines, then it is somewhat more complicated.  But there are solutions on  http://pmob.co.uk/   Look for "vertical align".  Since they tend to be hacks or adding complicated divs... I usually use a table with a single cell to do it...  to make it as simple as possible.It can be more commonly done with transform, and it works well even in older browsers such as IE10 and IE11. It can support multiple lines of text:example: https://jsfiddle.net/wb8u02kL/1/The solution above used a fixed width for the content area. To use a shrink wrap width, useexample: https://jsfiddle.net/wb8u02kL/2/I tried flexbox, but it wasn\'t as widely supported, as it would break in some older version of IE such as IE10.Example Here / Full Screen ExampleIn supported browsers (most of them), you can use top: 50%/left: 50% in combination with  translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%) to dynamically vertically/horizontally center the element.Example Here / Full Screen ExampleIn supported browsers, set the display of the targeted element to flex and use align-items: center for vertical centering and justify-content: center for horizontal centering. Just don\'t forget to add vendor prefixes for additional browser support (see example).Example Here / Full Screen ExampleIn some cases, you will need to ensure that the html/body element\'s height is set to 100%.For vertical alignment, set the parent element\'s width/height to 100% and add display: table. Then for the child element, change the display to table-cell and add vertical-align: middle.For horizontal centering, you could either add text-align: center to center the text and any other inline children elements. Alternatively, you could use margin: 0 auto assuming the element is block level.Example Here / Full Screen ExampleThis approach assumes that the text has a known height - in this instance, 18px. Just absolutely position the element 50% from the top, relative to the parent element. Use a negative margin-top value that is half of the element\'s known height, in this case - -9px.Example HereIn some cases, the parent element will have a fixed height. For vertical centering, all you have to do is set a line-height value on the child element equal to the fixed height of the parent element.Though this solution will work in some cases, it\'s worth noting that it won\'t work when there are multiple lines of text - like this.Methods 4 and 5 aren\'t the most reliable. Go with one of the first 3.Using flexbox/CSS: The CSS:Taken from Quick Tip: The Simplest Way To Center Elements Vertically And Horizontallyadd the line  display: table-cell; to your css for that div.\nonly table cells support the vertical-align:middle; but you can give that [table-cell] definition to the div..live example here: http://jsfiddle.net/tH2cc/I always use the following CSS for a container, to center it\'s content horizontally and vertically.See it in action here: https://jsfiddle.net/yp1gusn7/you can try very easy code for thiscodpen link http://codepen.io/santoshkhalse/pen/xRmZwrAdjusting line height to get the vertical alignment.This works for me (tested ok!)html:css:you can choose other values then 50% fi. 25% to center at 25% of parentYou can try the following methods:1. If you have a single word or one line sentence, then the following code can do the trick.Have a text inside a div tag and give it an id. Define the following properties for that id.Note: Make sure the line-height property is same as the height of the division. ImageBut, if the content is more than one single word or a line then this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Also, there will be times when you cannot specify the size of a divison in px or %.(when the divison is really small and you want the content to be exactly in the middle)2. To solve this issue, we can try the following combination of properties.  ImageThese 3 lines of code sets the content exactly in the middle of a division (Irrespective of the size of the display). The "align-items: center" helps in vertical centering while "justify-content: center" will make it  horizontally centered.Note: Flex does not work in all browsers. Make sure you add appropriate vendor prefixes for additional browser support.   Apply style:Your text would be centered irrespective of its length.Give this css class to the targeted This should be the right answer. Cleanest and simplest:
