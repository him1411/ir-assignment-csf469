I\'m thinking of using docker to build my dependencies on a CI server, so that I don\'t have to install all the runtimes and libraries on the agents themselves. To achieve this I would need to copy the build artifacts that are built inside the container back into the host.Is that possible?In order to copy a file from a container to the host, you can use the commandMount a "volume" and copy the artifacts into there:Then when the build finishes and the container is no longer running, it has already copied the artifacts from the build into the artifacts directory on the host.EDIT:CAVEAT: When you do this, you may run into problems with the user id of the docker user matching the user id of the current running user. That is, the files in /artifacts will be shown as owned by the user with the UID of the user used inside the docker container. A way around this may be to use the calling user\'s UID:Mount a volume, copy the artifacts, adjust owner id and group id:I am posting this for anyone that is using Docker for Mac.\nThis is what worked for me:Note that when I mount using -v that backup directory is automatically created.I hope this is useful to someone someday. :)As a more general solution, there\'s a CloudBees plugin for Jenkins to build inside a Docker container.  You can select an image to use from a Docker registry or define a Dockerfile to build and use. It\'ll mount the workspace into the container as a volume (with appropriate user), set it as your working directory, do whatever commands you request (inside the container).\nYou can also use the docker-workflow plugin (if you prefer code over UI) to do this, with the image.inside() {} command. Basically all of this, baked into your CI/CD server and then some. tldr;Longer...docker run with a host volume, chown the artifact, cp the artifact to the host volume:This trick works because the chown invocation within the heredoc the takes $(id -u):$(id -g) values from outside the running container; i.e., the docker host.The benefits over docker cp are:If the container is running on any Linux distribution then you can copy the the file from the host to container and vice versa.For this, you can use Linux scp  command to copy a file from one host machine to another host machine. The fact is, you need to know the IP address of the container and a bridge between the host.A simple example is given here:Copy a file from a container to the host machine.Copy a file from local machine to the containerCreate a data directory on the host system (outside the container) and mount this to a directory visible from inside the container. This places the files in a known location on the host system, and makes it easy for tools and applications on the host system to access the files
