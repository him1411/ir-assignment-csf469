Is there a corresponding X mark to ✓ (&#x2713;)? What is it?A corresponding cross for ✓ &#x2713; would be ✗ &#x2717; I think (Dingbats).✗ ✘ ✕ ✖ Source: HTML Entities | Dingbats Personally, I like to use named entities when they are available, because they make my HTML more readable. Because of that, I like to use &check; for &check; and &cross; for &cross;. If you\'re not sure whether a named entity exists for the character you want, try the &what search site. It includes the name for each entity, if there is one.As mentioned in the comments, &check; and &cross; are not supported in HTML4, so you may be better off using the more cryptic &#x2713; and &#x2717; if you want to target the most browsers. The most definitive references I could find were on the W3C site: HTML4 and HTML5.It\'s between the Z and the C on your keyboard.
