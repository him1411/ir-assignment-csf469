Is it possible to reduce the gap between text when put in multiple lines in a UILabel? We can set the frame, font size and # of lines. I want to reduce the gap between the two lines in that label.I thought about adding something new to this answer, so I don\'t feel as bad... Here is a Swift answer:"Short answer: you can\'t. To change the spacing between lines of text, you will have to subclass UILabel and roll your own drawTextInRect, or create multiple labels."See: Set UILabel line spacingThis is a really old answer, and other have already addded the new and better way to handle this.. Please see the up to date answers provided below.In Xcode 6 you can do this in the storyboard:Starting from iOS 6 you can set an attributed string to the UILabel. Check the following : The solutions stated here didn\'t work for me. I found a slightly different way to do it with the iOS 6 NSAttributeString:There\'s an alternative answer now in iOS 6, which is to set attributedText on the label, using an NSAttributedString with the appropriate paragraph styles. See this stack overflow answer for details on line height with NSAttributedString:Core Text - NSAttributedString line height done right?I\'ve made this simple extension that works very well for me:Copy this in a file, so then you can use it like thisHere is a class that subclass UILabel to have line-height property : https://github.com/LemonCake/MSLabelIn Swift and as a function, inspired by DarkDustAccording @Mike \'s Answer, reducing the lineHeightMultiple is the key point. Example below, it work well for me:SWIFT 3 useful extension for set space between lines more easily :)In Swift 2.0...Add an extension: Now, just set your UILabel as attributedText: Obviously, I added a bunch of parameters that you may not need. Play around -- feel free to rewrite the method -- I was looking for this on a bunch of different answers so figured I\'d post the whole extension in case it helps someone out there...  -rabSwift 3\nHere is solution with swift 3. Just copy & execute this code to see resultThis code worked for me (ios 7 & ios 8  for sure).Swift3 - In a UITextView or UILabel extension, add this function:I added some code to keep the current attributed text if you are already using attributed strings with the view (instead of overwriting them).Another answer... If you\'re passing the string programmatically, you need to pass a attributed string instead a regular string and change it\'s style.(iOS10)Swift 3 extension: I\'ve found a way where you can set the real line height (not a factor) and it even renders live in Interface Builder. Just follow the instructions below. Code is written in Swift 4.Step #1: Create a file named DesignableLabel.swift and insert the following code:Step #2: Place a UILabel into a Storyboard/XIB and set its class to DesignableLabel. Wait for your project to build (build must succeed!).Step 3: Now you should see a new property in the properties pane named "Line Height". Just set the value you like and you should see the results immediately!As a quick-dirty-smart-simple workaround:For UILabels that don\'t have much lines you can instead use stackViews.Be sure to stack them vertically.\nThis solution also works for custom fonts.
