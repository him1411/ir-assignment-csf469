When I try to run CMake generated makefile to compile my program, I get the error that range based for loops are not supported in C++ 98 mode. I tried adding add_definitions(-std=c++0x) to my CMakeLists.txt, but it did not help. \nI tried this too:When I do g++ --version, I get:g++ (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) 4.6.1I have also tried SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++0x"), which also does not work.I do not understand how I can activate C++ 11 features using CMake.CMake 3.1 introduced the CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD variable that you can use.  If you know that you will always have CMake 3.1 available, you can just write this in your top-level CMakeLists.txt file, or put it right before any new target is defined:If you need to support older versions of CMake, here is a macro I came up with that you can use:The macro only supports GCC right now, but it should be straight-forward to expand it to other compilers.Then you could write use_cxx11() at the top of any CMakeLists.txt file that defines a target that uses C++11.The CMake command target_compile_features() is used to specify the required C++ feature cxx_range_for. CMake will then induce the C++ standard to be used.There is no need to use add_definitions(-std=c++11) or to modify the CMake variable CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS, because CMake will make sure the C++ compiler is invoked with the appropriate command line flags.Maybe your C++ program uses other C++ features than cxx_range_for. The CMake global property CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES lists the C++ features you can choose from.Instead of using target_compile_features() you can also specify the C++ standard explicitly by setting the CMake properties \nCXX_STANDARD\n and \nCXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED for your CMake target.See also my more detailed answer.I am usingBut if you want to play with C++11, g++ 4.6.1 is pretty old.\nTry to get a newer g++ version.As it turns out, SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++0x") does activate many C++11 features. The reason it did not work was that the statement looked like this:Following this approach, somehow the -std=c++0x flag was overwritten and it did not work. Setting the flags one by one or using a list method is working.The easiest way to set cxx standard isSee cmake doc for more details.The easiest way:add_compile_options(-std=c++11)This is another way of enabling C++11 support,I have encountered instances where only this method works and other methods fail. Maybe it has something to do with the latest version of CMake.What works for me is to set the following line in your CMakeLists.txt:Setting this command activates the C++11 features for the compiler and after executing the cmake .. command, you should be able to use range based for loops in your code and compile it without any errors.OSX and homebrewed LLVM related:Don\'t forget to call cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.3) and project() after it!Or cmake will insert project() implicitly before line 1 causing trouble with clang version detection and possibly other sorts of troubles.
