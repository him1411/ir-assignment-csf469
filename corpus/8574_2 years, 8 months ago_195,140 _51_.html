There\'s a similar post on stack but it doesn\'t help with my issue possibly because I am using Visual Studio 2015.How do I get the "Enable NuGet Package Restore" option to appear in VS2015?I chose File > New Project and created an empty ASP.NET Web Application. I\'m looking for this menu option.I should mention that I have looked for any pre-existing nuGet files in my project folder and there are none.It took far too long but I finally found this document on Migrating MSBuild-Integrated solutions to Automatic Package Restore and I was able to resolve the issue using the methods described here. When editing your files by hand, here\'s what you\'ll be looking for:Solution File (.sln)Project File (.csproj / .vbproj)Microsoft has dropped support for the \'Enable NuGet Package Restore\' in VS2015 and you need to do some manual changes to either migrate old solutions or add the feature to new solutions.  The new feature is described pretty well in NuGet Package Restore.There is also a migration guide for existing projects (as previously mentioned) here: NuGet Migration GuideWhen upgrading:When creating a new project:Create a file in the .nuget directory called nuget.config.Add the \'nuget.config\' to the solution directory created in step #2.Place the following text in the nuget.config file:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>\n <configuration>\n  <config>\n    <add key="repositorypath" value="$\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Packages" />\n  </config>\n  <solution>\n    <add key="disableSourceControlIntegration" value="true" />\n  </solution>\n</configuration>This configuration file will allow you to consolidate all your packages in a single place so you don\'t have 20 different copies of the same package floating around on your file system.  The relative path will change depending on your solution directory architecture but it should point to a directory common to all your solutions.You need to restart visual studio after doing step 5. Nuget won\'t recognize the changes until you do so.Finally, you may have to use the \'Nuget Package Manager for Solutions\' to uninstall and then re-install the packages.  I don\'t know if this was a side-effect of the Powershell script I ran or just a method to kick NuGet back into gear.  Once I did all these steps, my complicated build architecture worked flawlessly at bringing down new packages when I checked projects out of TFVC.Optionally you can remove all folders from "packages" folder and select "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...". In this case "Restore" button appears on NuGet Packages Windows. If you have any problems or are missing any packages you can simply right-click in your project and select "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...". After clicking on this a screen will open where you see a menu bar saying "Restore":\nClick on it and the required packages will be installed automatically.\nI believe this is what you\'re looking for, this solved my problems.When upgrading projects with nuget packages from Vx20XX to VS2015, you might have a problem with nuget packages. Example of error message:\nThis project references NuGet package(s) that are missing on this computer. Enable NuGet Package Restore to download them. Update 2016-02-06: I had a link to the information but it does not work anymore. I suspect that a recent path has solved the problem ???I fixed my problem writing a little program that do MSBuild-Integrated package restore vs. Automatic Package RestoreYou can download executable of the tool here.Please let me know the result :-) !Code as reference:I suppose that for asp.net 4 project we\'re moving to automatic restore, so there is no need for this. For older projects I think a bit of work to convert is needed.http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/migrating-to-automatic-package-restoreGo at References in visual studio and look at which packages are missing.\nNow right click on Solution in Visual and click on open folder in file explorer.\nNow open packages folder and delete missing packages folder.\nOpen visual studio and just build the solution. all the missing packages will be restore.\nPlease mark this as answer if I helped.I faced the same issue while trying to build sample project gplus-quickstart-csharp-master.I looked closely error message and found a workaround from overcoming this error, hopefully, this will help.Enjoy !!This approach worked for me: You have now enabled nuget package restore in VS2015 as well.Ivan Branets \'s solution is essentially what fixed this for me, but some more details could be shared.In my case, I was in VS 2015 using Auto Package restore and TFS.  This is all pretty default stuff.The problem was that when another developer tried to get a solution from TFS, some packages were not fully getting restored.  (Why, that I\'m not quite sure yet.)  But the packages folder contained a folder for the reference and the NuGet package, but it wasn\'t getting expanded (say a lib folder containing a .dll was missing.)  This half there, but not really quite right concept was preventing the package from being restored.You\'ll recognize this because the reference will have a yellow exclamation point about not being resolved.So, the solution of deleting the folder within packages removes the package restore blocking issue. Then you can right click at the top solution level to get the option to restore packages, and now it should work.Could also be a result of running the program while you\'re trying to install the package. it\'s grayed out if you try to click it while the built in IIS is running in the background.I had to remove packages folder close and re-open (VS2015) solution.  I was not migrating and I did not have packages checked into source control.  All I can say is something got messed up and this fixed it.In case anyone else finds this problem in Visual Studio 2017, make sure the project is opened by the .sln file and not the folder, as visual studio won\'t pick up the settings if it\'s opened by folder. This happens by default if you\'re using Visual Studio online services for git.As already mentioned by Mike, there is no option \'Enable NuGet Package Restore\' in VS2015. You\'ll have to invoke the restore process manually. A nice way - without messing with files and directories - is using the NuGet Package Management Console: Click into the \'Quick start\' field (usually in the upper right corner), enter console, open the management console, and enter command:This will re-install all packages of all projects in your solution. To specify a single project, enter:Of course this is only necessary when the Restore button - sometimes offered by VS2015 - is not available. More useful update commands are listed and explained here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/reinstalling-and-updating-packagesEven simpler, add a .nuget folder to your solution and the \'Restore Nuget Packages\' will appear (not sure whether nuget.exe needs to be present for it to work).
