What do the icons in the Eclipse debugger mean?\nWhat do the icon decorators in Eclipse mean?\nWhat do the icons in Eclipse\'s Package Explorer mean?\nWhat do the little letters on top of Eclipse icons mean?\nWhat\'s the difference between the two error icons in Eclipse (the x in the red circle and the one with the light bulb)?I just came to SO looking for this, didn\'t find it, and found it on my own elsewhere. But I thought it would be good for SO to have the answer for future reference; I wondered about them all the time when I was new to Eclipse (this was before I discovered SO).This is a fairly comprehensive list from the Eclipse documentation.  If anyone knows of another list — maybe with more details, or just the most common icons — feel free to add it.Neon: JDT IconsMars: JDT IconsLuna: JDT IconsKepler: JDT IconsJuno: JDT IconsIndigo: JDT IconsHelios: JDT IconsThere are also some CDT icons at the bottom of this help page.If you\'re a Subversion user, the icons you\'re looking for may actually belong to Subclipse; see this excellent answer for more on those.I can\'t find a way to create a table with icons in SO, so I am uploading 2 images.\n
