What\'s the easiest way to create a file in Linux?Depending on what you want the file to contain:somecommand > /path/to/file for a file containing the output of some command.nano /path/to/file or vi /path/to/file (or any other editor emacs,gedit etc)\nIt either opens the existing one for editing or creates & opens the empty file to enter, if it doesn\'t existUse touchCreate the file using cat$ cat > myfile.txtNow, just type whatever you want in the file:Hello World!CTRL-D to save and exitThere are several possible solutions:The echo version will work only if your version of echo supports the -n switch to suppress newlines. This is a non-standard addition. The other examples will all work in a POSIX shell.This is a valid "text file" because it ends in a newline.These are equivalent. The $EDITOR command assumes that you have an interactive text editor defined in the EDITOR environment variable and that you interactively enter equivalent text. The cat version presumes a literal newline after the \\ and after each other line. Other than that these will all work in a POSIX shell.Of course there are many other methods of writing and creating files, too.Also, create an empty file:haha! it\'s easy! try this:You can use touch command, as the others said:To write on file on command line, you can use echo or printf:Maybe you can have problems with permissions. If you are getting the following error: bash: filename: Permission denied, you need to use sudo bash -c \'echo "Foo" > filename\', as described here:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/103643/cannot-echo-hello-x-txt-even-with-sudoHow to create a text file on Linux:You can use the touch command to create a new empty file.http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl_touch.htmI like the nano command-line editor (text):1st method2nd method3rd methodTo view the file contents This will create an empty file with the current timestampIn case you guys are trying to create a new file, but it says: \'File does not exist\', it\'s simply because you are also accessing a directory, which does not exist yet. You have to create all non existent directories first, using the mkdir /path/to/dir command.Simple as that :> filename
