In the Solution Explorer, I clicked on "Scope to this" to display only a part of the solution. Now I can\'t find how to get back to normal view.Closing/Reopening Solution Explorer won\'t work; I searched every menu item, and "New Solution Explorer View" didn\'t work either; I found nothing on Google.I must be missing something obvious... There has to be an easy way to undo "Scope to this", right?Click the "Home" icon (third one by default, the one with a house pictogram) in the Solution explorer. This will revert the view to the full solution.In addition to pressing the \'home\' button you should also see, in the top left hand corner of the Solution Explorer, two arrows.  Pressing the left pointing one will take you back out of scope to this and pressing the right one will put you back into it.  Essentially, they work as forward and back buttons.Extra:You can also right click on projects and select \'New Solution Explorer Window\' to have two separate solution explorers which can work independently.
