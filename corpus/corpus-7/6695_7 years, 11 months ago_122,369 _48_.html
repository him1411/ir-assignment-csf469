I want to join a String[] with a glue string. Is there a function for this?Starting from Java8 it is possible to use String.join().Generates:Otherwise, Apache Commons Lang has a StringUtils class which has a join function which will join arrays together to make a String.For example:Generates the following String:If you were looking for what to use in android, it is:for example:In Java 8 you can use 1) Stream API :2) new String.join method: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21756398/466677 3) java.util.StringJoiner class: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/StringJoiner.htmlYou could easily write such a function in about ten lines of code:A little mod instead of using substring():As with many questions lately, Java 8 to the rescue:Java 8 added a new static method to java.lang.String which does exactly what you want:Using it:Results in:Google guava\'s library also has this kind of capability. You can see the String[] example also from the API.As already described in the api, beware of the immutability of the builder methods.It can accept an array of objects so it\'ll work in your case. In my previous experience, i tried joining a Stack which is an iterable and it works fine.Sample from me :prints out : |i am a coder|Given:Then as an alternative to coobird\'s answer, where the glue is ", ":Or to concatenate with a different string, such as " &amp; ".However... this one ONLY works if you know that the values in the array or list DO NOT contain the character string ", ".If you are using the Spring Framework then you have the StringUtils class:Not in core, no. A search for "java array join string glue" will give you some code snippets on how to achieve this though.e.g.If you\'ve landed here looking for a quick array-to-string conversion, try Arrays.toString().Creates a String representation of the Object[] passed. The result is\n  surrounded by brackets ("[]"), each element is converted to a String\n  via the String.valueOf(Object) and separated by ", ". If the array is\n  null, then "null" is returned.Just for the "I\'ve the shortest one" challenge, here are mines ;)Iterative:Recursive:Nothing built-in that I know of.Apache Commons Lang has a class called StringUtils which contains many join functions.This is how I do it.A similar alternativeMy spin.Do you like my 3-lines way using only String class\'s methods?To get "str1, str2" from "str1", "str2", "" :Also you can add extra null-checkIn case you\'re using Functional Java library and for some reason can\'t use Streams from Java 8 (which might be the case when using Android + Retrolambda plugin), here is a functional solution for you:Note that it\'s not the most efficient approach, but it does work good for small lists.I do it this way using a StringBuilder:There is simple shorthand technique I use most of the times..java.util.Arrays has an \'asList\' method. Together with the java.util.List/ArrayList API this gives you all you need:;
