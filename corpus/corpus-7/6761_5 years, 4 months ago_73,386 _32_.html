I was making my way through the Scala playframework tutorial and I came across this snippet of code which had me puzzled: So I decided to investigate and came across this post.I still don\'t get it.What is the difference between this: andother than the obvious fact they have different method names.When should I use implicit and why?I\'ll explain the main use cases of implicits below, but for more detail see the relevant chapter of Programming in Scala.Implict parametersThe final parameter list on a method can be marked implicit, which means the values will be taken from the context in which they are called. If there is no implicit value of the right type in scope, it will not compile. Since the implicit value must resolve to a single value and to avoid clashes, it\'s a good idea to make the type specific to its purpose, e.g. don\'t require your methods to find an implicit Int!example:Implicit conversionsWhen the compiler finds an expression of the wrong type for the context, it will look for an implicit Function value of a type that will allow it to typecheck. So if an A is required and it finds a B, it will look for an implicit value of type B => A in scope (it also checks some other places like in the B and A companion objects, if they exist). Since defs can be "eta-expanded" into Function objects, an implicit def xyz(arg: B): A will do as well.So the difference between your methods is that the one marked implicit will be inserted for you by the compiler when a Double is found but an Int is required. will work the same asIn the second we\'ve inserted the conversion manually; in the first the compiler did the same automatically. The conversion is required because of the type annotation on the left hand side.Regarding your first snippet from Play:Actions are explained on this page from the Play documentation (see also API docs). You are using on the Action object (which is the companion to the trait of the same name).So we need to supply a Function as the argument, which can be written as a literal in the form In a function literal, the part before the => is a value declaration, and can be marked implicit if you want, just like in any other val declaration. Here, request doesn\'t have to be marked implicit for this to type check, but by doing so it will be available as an implicit value for any methods that might need it within the function (and of course, it can be used explicitly as well). In this particular case, this has been done because the bindFromRequest method on the Form class requires an implicit Request argument.WARNING: contains sarcasm judiciously! YMMV...Luigi\'s answer is complete and correct. This one is only to extend it a bit with an example of how you can gloriously overuse implicits, as it happens quite often in Scala projects. Actually so often, you can probably even find it in one of the "Best Practice" guides.Why and when you should mark the request parameter as implicit: Some methods that you will make use of in the body of your action have an implicit parameter list like, for example, Form.scala defines a method:You don\'t necessarily notice this as you would just call myForm.bindFromRequest() You don\'t have to provide the implicit arguments explicitly. No, you leave the compiler to look for any valid candidate object to pass in every time it comes across a method call that requires an instance of the request. Since you do have a request available, all you need to do is to mark it as implicit.You explicitly mark it as available for implicit use.You hint the compiler that it\'s "OK" to use the request object sent in by the Play framework (that we gave the name "request" but could have used just "r" or "req") wherever required, "on the sly". see it? it\'s not there, but it is there!It just happens without your having to slot it in manually in every place it\'s needed (but you can pass it explicitly, if you so wish, no matter if it\'s marked implicit or not):Without marking it as implicit, you would have to do the above. Marking it as implicit you don\'t have to.When should you mark the request as implicit? You only really need to if you are making use of methods that declare an implicit parameter list expecting an instance of the Request. But to keep it simple, you could just get into the habit of marking the request implicit always. That way you can just write beautiful terse code.
