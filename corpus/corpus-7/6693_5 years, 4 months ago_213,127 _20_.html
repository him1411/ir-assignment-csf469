I want to be able to get the data sent to my Flask app.  I\'ve tried accessing request.data but it is an empty string. How do you access request data?The answer to this question led me to ask Get raw POST body in Python Flask regardless of Content-Type header next, which is about getting the raw data rather than the parsed data.The docs describe the attributes available on the request.  In most common cases request.data will be empty because it\'s used as a fallback:request.data Contains the incoming request data as string in case it came with a mimetype Flask does not handle.It is simply as followsFor URL Query parameter, use request.argsFor Form input, use request.formFor data type application/json, use request.dataI give a full example of application/json:use PostMan for post request:use curl command:P.S.\nFor URL Query parameter example, you can see my answer in Multiple parameters in in Flask approuteFlask has another shortcut for JSON:Header: if you want the raw post body regardless of the content type, you should use request.get_data(), because request.form is converted to werkzeug.ImmutableMultiDict format.Now, data is the request bodySimply speaking, you can get data by the way below:Now, g.data is an instance of werkzeug.ImmutableMultiDict. Then you can use g.data which can handle most of your requirements. For example, you can use it just like this:Of course, you can use blueprint instead of app~~
