I have a project that has a submodule at lib/three20My .gitmodule file looks like this:I have cloned this in the past without errors, (git submodule init followed by a git submodule update) and it\'s been working for a while.I tried to clone this to a new machine, and now I\'m getting this error on git submodule init:That path is just an empty folder in Xcode that I use to house the projects from the other directory.  It\'s not part of the .gitmodules file, so I don\'t see where it\'s getting this path from.Any ideas?Update November 2013:Following rajibchowdhury\'s answer (upvoted), the git rm which is advised is for removing the special entry in the index indicating a submodule (a \'folder\' with a special mode \'160000\').  If that special entry path isn\'t referenced in the .gitmodule (like \'Classes/Support/Three20\' in the original question), then you need to remove it, in order to avoid the "No submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path" error message.You can check all the entries in the index which reference a submodule:Original answer (November 2010)Did you declare your initial submodule correctly? (i.e. without any tail \'/\' at the end, as described in my old answer, even though your .gitmodule has paths which looks ok in it).This thread mentions:do you get the same error when running \'git submodule init\' from a fresh clone?\n  If so, you have something wrong.  If you have no submodules, delete .gitmodules, and any references to submodules in\n  .git/config, and ensure the Pikimal dir does not have a .git dir in it.\n  If that fixes the problem, check in and do the same on your cruise working copy. Obviously, don\'t delete your main .gitmodules file, but look after other extra .gitmodules files in your working tree.Still in the topic of "incorrect submodule initialization", Jefromi mentions submodules which actually are gitlinks.\nSee "Git - how to track untracked content?" to see how to convert such a directory to a real submodule.No submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path \'OtherLibrary/MKStore\'\nwhenI didn\'t know why the error occur. After spending a minute and found the answer in stackoverflow.and then update the submodule again. It\'s working fine.http://en.saturngod.net/no-submodule-mapping-found-in-gitmodulesWhen I use SourceTree to do the stuff, it will spit out this message.\nThe message that I encountered:My scenario is I misapplied the project directory the contains .git folder.\nSourceTree regarded this folder as git submodule, but actually not.  My solution is use command line to remove it.  remove the garbage in git and keep it clean.I resolved this issue for me. Initially I tried to do this:As it turns out the specification of the --branch option should not be used if you want to clone the master branch. It throws this error:Every time you try to do aThis error will be thrown:And the lines needed in .gitmodules are never added.So the solution for me was this:I just hit this error after trying to "git submodule init" on a new checkout of my repo. Turns out I had specified the module sub-folder with the wrong case initially. Since I\'m on a Mac with a case-sensitive filesystem (hurr) it was failing. For example:succeeds but the trouble is that on disk the path is What I don\'t understand is why git is init\'ing the module to wrong folder (ignoring the incorrect case in my command) but then operating correctly (by failing) with subsequent commands.Just had this problem.  For a while I tried the advice about removing the path, git removing the path, removing .gitmodules, removing the entry from .git/config, adding the submodule back, then committing and pushing the change.  It was puzzling because it looked like no change when I did "git commit -a" so I tried pushing just the removal, then pushing the readdition to make it look like a change.After a while I noticed by accident that after removing everything, if I ran "git submodule update --init", it had a message about a specific name that git should no longer have had any reference to: the name of the repository the submodule was linking to, not the path name it was checking it out to.  Grepping revealed that this reference was in .git/index.  So I ran "git rm --cached repo-name" and then readded the module.  When I committed this time, the commit message included a change that it was deleting this unexpected object.  After that it works fine.Not sure what happened, I\'m guessing someone misused the git submodule command, maybe reversing the arguments.  Could have been me even...  Hope this helps someone!Scenario: changing the submodule from directory dirA-xxx to another directory dirB-xxxrun  git submodule statusif return error: No submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path dirA-xxx. This is due to dirA-xxx is not existing, yet it is still tracked by git. Update the git index by: git rm --cached dirA-xxxTry with git submodule foreach git pull.\nI didn\'t go through the actual study of git submodule structure, so above steps may break something. Nonetheless going through above steps, things look good at the moment. If you have any insight or proper steps to get thing done, do share it here. :)The folder mapping can be found in .git/modules folder (each has config file with reference to its worktree), so make sure these folders correspond to the configuration in .gitmodules and .git/config.So .gitmodules has the correct path:and in .git/modules/<path>/config in [core] section you\'ve the right path to your <path>, e.g.If the right folder in .git/modules is missing, then you\'ve to go to your submodule dir and try git reset HEAD --hard or git checkout master -f. If this won\'t help, you probably want to remove all the references to the broken submodule and add it again, then see: Rename a git submodule.Just git rm subdir  will be ok. that will remove the subdir as an index.in the file .gitmodules, I replaced string with and it solved! - -Usually, git creates a hidden directory in project\'s root directory (.git/)When you\'re working on a CMS, its possible you install modules/plugins carrying .git/ directory with git\'s metadata for the specific module/pluginQuickest solution is to find all .git directories and keep only your root git metadata directory. If you do so, git will not consider those modules as project submodules.After looking at my .gitsubmodules, it turned out I did have an uppercase letter where I should not have.  So keep in mind, the .gitsubmodules directories are case sensitiveIn my case the error was probably due to an incorrect merge between .gitmodules on two branches with different submodules configurations.\nAfter taking suggestions from this forum, I solved the problem editing manually the .gitmodules file, adding the missing submodule entry is pretty easy. After that, the command \ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nworked with no issues.
