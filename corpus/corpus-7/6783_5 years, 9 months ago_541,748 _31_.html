What is the "less code needed" way to get parameters from a URL query string which is formatted like the following?www.mysite.com/category/subcategory?myqueryhashOutput should be: myqueryhashI am aware of this approach:$_SERVER[\'QUERY_STRING\'] contains the data that you are looking for.DOCUMENTATIONThe function parse_str automatically transforms all query parameters into corresponding PHP variables. For example from the following URL:this code:will automatically create variables $x and $y with values 100 and 200 which you can then use in your code.The PHP way to do it is using the function parse_url, which parses a URL and return its components. Including the query string.Example:Full documentation hereIf you want the whole query string:I will recommended best answer as <?php\necho \'Hello \' . htmlspecialchars($_GET["name"]) . \'!\';\n?>Assuming the user entered http://example.com/?name=HannesThe above example will output:Hello Hannes! Also if you are looking for current file name along with the query string, you will just need following It would provide you info like following examplefile.php?arg1=val&arg2=valAnd if you also want full path of file as well starting from root, e.g. /folder/folder2/file.php?arg1=val&arg2=val then just remove basename() function and just use fillowingHere is my function to rebuild parts of the REFERRER\'s query string.If the calling page already had a query string in its own URL, and you must go back to that page and want to send back some, not all, of that $_GET vars (e.g. a page number).Example: Referrer\'s query string was ?foo=1&bar=2&baz=3 calling refererQueryString( \'foo\' , \'baz\' ) returns foo=1&baz=3":For getting each node in the URI, you can use function explode() to $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\'].  If you want to get strings without knowing if it is passed or not. you may use the function I defined myself to get query parameters from $_REQUEST (as it works both for POST and GET params).There might be some cases when we want to get query parameters converted into Integer type, so I added the third parameter to this function.This code and notation is not mine. Evan K solves a multi value same name query with a custom function ;)\nis taken from :http://php.net/manual/en/function.parse-str.php#76792\nCredits go to Evan K.It bears mentioning that the parse_str builtin does NOT process a query string in the CGI standard way, when it comes to duplicate fields.  If multiple fields of the same name exist in a query string, every other web processing language would read them into an array, but PHP silently overwrites them:Thanks to @K. Shahzad\nThis helps when you want the rewrited query string without any rewrite additions. Let say you rewrite the /test/?x=y to index.php?q=test&x=y and you want only want the query string.
