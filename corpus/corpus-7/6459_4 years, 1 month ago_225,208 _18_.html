If I have this schema...... where the favoriteFood array is populated with strings. How can I find all persons that have "sushi" as their favorite food using mongoose?I was hoping for something along the lines of:(I know that there is no $contains in mongodb, just explaining what I was expecting to find before knowing the solution)As favouriteFoods is a simple array of strings, you can just query that field directly:But I\'d also recommend making the string array explicit in your schema:There is no $contains operator in mongodb.You can use the answer from JohnnyHK as that works. The closest analogy to contains that mongo has is $in, using this your query would look like:In case you need to find documents which contain NULL elements inside an array of sub-documents, I\'ve found this query which works pretty well:This query is taken from this post: MongoDb query array with null valuesIt was a great find and it works much better than my own initial and wrong version (which turned out to work fine only for arrays with one element):I feel like $all would be more appropriate in this situation. If you are looking for person that is into sushi you do :As you might want to filter more your search, like so :$in is like OR and $all like AND. Check this : https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/all/In case that the array contains objects for example if favouriteFoods is an array of objects of the following:you can use the following query:I know this topic is old, but for future people who could wonder the same question, another incredibly inefficient solution could be to do:This avoids all optimisations by MongoDB so do not use in production code.
