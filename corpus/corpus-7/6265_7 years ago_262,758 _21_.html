What is the most accepted way to convert a boolean to an int in Java?^^PS : true = 1 and false = 0Using the ternary operator is the most simple, most efficient, and most readable way to do what you want. I encourage you to use this solution.However, I can\'t resist to propose an alternative, contrived, inefficient, unreadable solution.Hey, people like to vote for such cool answers !EditBy the way, I often saw conversions from a boolean to an int for the sole purpose of doing a comparison of the two values (generally, in implementations of compareTo method). Boolean#compareTo is the way to go in those specific cases.Edit 2Java 7 introduced a new utility function that works with primitive types directly, Boolean#compare (Thanks shmosel)simpleThat depends on the situation. Often the most simple approach is the best because it is easy to understand:orBut sometimes it useful to use an Enum instead of a boolean flag. Let imagine there are synchronous and asynchronous processes:In Java, enum can have additional attributes and methods:If true -> 1 and false -> 0 mapping is what you want, you can do:If you want to obfuscate, use this:Lets play trick with Boolean.compare(boolean, boolean). Default behavior of function: if both values are equal than it returns 0 otherwise -1.Explanation: As we know default return of Boolean.compare is -1 in case of mis-match so +1 make return value to 0 for False and 1 for TrueIf you use Apache Commons Lang (which I think a lot of projects use it), you can just use it like this: toInteger method returns 1 if boolean_expression is true, 0 otherwise
