I\'m looking to set the left inset/margin of a UILabel and can\'t find a method to do so. The label has a background set so just changing its origin won\'t do the trick. It would be ideal to inset the text by 10px or so on the left hand side.I solved this by subclassing UILabel and overriding drawTextInRect: like this:equivalent in Swift 3.1: As you might have gathered, this is an adaptation of tc.\'s answer. It has two advantages over that one:For multiline text the left and the right margin can be set by using NSAttributedString.The best approach to add padding to a UILabel is to subclass UILabel and add an edgeInsets property.  You then set the desired insets and the label will be drawn accordingly.OSLabel.hOSLabel.mSubclassing is a little cumbersome for such a simple case.  An alternative is to simply add the UILabel with no background set to a UIView with the background set.  Set the label\'s x to 10 and make the outer view\'s size 10 pixels wider than the label.I ended up just adding some spaces to the text:Ugly yet effective, and no subclassing required.You can try "\\t" as well. For a generic solution please refer to the accepted answerWith Swift 3, you can have the desired effect by creating a subclass of UILabel. In this subclass, you will have to add a UIEdgeInsets property with the required insets and override drawText(in:) method, intrinsicContentSize property (for Auto layout code) and/or sizeThatFits(_:) method (for Springs & Struts code).The following example shows how to use PaddingLabel instances in a UIViewController:You can also solve this by initializing your UILabel with a custom frame.Nod to CGRect Tricks.Swift version of Recycled Steel\'s answer + intrinsizeContentSize().It supports a more traditional style of setting insets for other view objects with insets while being able to set insets in Interface Builder, i.e. insets are set like so programmatically:Please let me know if there are any bugs.Swift 3Swift 2.2For Xamarin users (using Unified API):And for those using the original MonoTouch API:To expand on the answer provided by Brody Robertson you can add the IB Designable bits.  This means you can adjust the label from within Storyboard.In your subclassed UILabel doThen do;EDITYou should probably add a setter method for edgeInsets.If you don\'t want to use an extra parent view to set the background, you can subclass UILabel and override textRectForBounds:limitedToNumberOfLines:. I\'d add a textEdgeInsets property or similar and then doFor robustness, you might also want to call [self setNeedsDisplay] in setTextEdgeInsets:, but I usually don\'t bother.and an @IBDesignable that make it work with Interface Builder  Maybe later for the party, but the following just works. Just subclass UILabel.If you\'re using autolayout in iOS 6+, you can do this by adjusting the intrinsicContentSize in a subclass of UILabel.Instead of UILabel perhaps use https://github.com/mattt/TTTAttributedLabelIn Swift it solves like this.Here is a swift solution. Just add this custom class on the bottom of your file (or create a new file for it) and use MyLabel instead of UILabel when creating your label.A lot of the answers are missing the override of sizeThatFits.  With this subclass you can just create the label, set the padding, and then say label.SizeToFit() and voila.Xcode 6.1.1 Swift solution using a extension.The file name could be something like "UILabel+AddInsetMargin.swift":without subclassing and all that jazz.. i did this dynamically:the constraint part is just a simple code sugar wrapper (we have the same methods for adding a padding from top/bottom/left/right).. i\'ll open source the whole wrapper if i get enough love here:(note i did this in the context of you may have to call [self setNeedsLayout]; depending on your context.blyabtroi\'s asnwer converted in Swift (No Subclassing required)}}}Just add a space or two before your actual string:I think UILabel class have no method for setting margin. Why you not set the position of Label at required place?See below code:if from interface builder then just position Label by following:To get rid of vertical padding for a single line label I did:OR, without the category, use:Swift 3 & AutoLayout compatible version:}Maybe you could give this code a tryThis is the easiest way I found. It works like a charm for me.Set the label\'s textAlignment property to NSTextAlignmentRight and augment its width.Don\'t code, Xcode !UIButton gives, out of the box, the ability to set Content Insets (top, left, bottom, right) in the Size inspector. Set the desired margins, disable the button right in Xcode and done.
