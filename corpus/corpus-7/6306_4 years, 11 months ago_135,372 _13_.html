What does "opt" mean (as in the "opt" directory)? I commonly see this directory in Unix systems with development tools inside.Is it an abbreviation?In the old days, "/opt" was used by UNIX vendors like AT&T, Sun, DEC and 3rd-party vendors to hold "Option" packages; i.e. packages that you might have paid extra money for.  I don\'t recall seeing "/opt" on Berkeley BSD UNIX.  They used "/usr/local" for stuff that you installed yourself.But of course, the true "meaning" of the different directories has always been somewhat vague.  That is arguably a good thing, because if these directories had precise (and rigidly enforced) meanings you\'d end up with a proliferation of different directory names.(And note that "folder" is not the preferred UNIX / Linux terminology.  They have been called "directories" in the UNIX context since Day 1.) It\'s usually describes as for optional add-on software packagessource, or anything that isn\'t part of the base system. Only some distributions use it, others simply use /usr/local.OPTionalIt holds optional software and packages that you install that are not required for the system to run.Add-on software packages.See http://www.pathname.com/fhs/2.2/fhs-3.12.html for details.Also described at Wikipedia.Its use dates back at least to the late 1980s, when it was a standard part of System V UNIX.  These days, it\'s also seen in Linux, Solaris (which is SysV), OSX Cygwin, etc.  Other BSD unixes (FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc) tend to follow other rules, so you don\'t usually see BSD systems with an /opt unless they\'re administered by someone who is more comfortable in other environments.It is an abbreviation for \'optional\' , used for optional software in some distros.
