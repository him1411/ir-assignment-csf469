I have been using the new \'Build and Archive\' feature of the latest XCode 3.2.3.  I like it.Now I noticed that it is always disabled for some reason.  I can\'t seem to figure out what I changed to cause this.Does anyone have any ideas?Build configiuration setting needs to be an "iOS Device" (or any specific device if connected) to activate "Product \xe2\x86\x92 Archive" menu item. For some strange reason when any kind of iOS Simulator is selected, Archive is greyed out.in my case, the archive checkbox was unchecked. =/ strangeAll you need to do is create an Executable File in your project folder... If you start with a fresh project there are NO executable projects, only what you create, be it a .cpp or a .m you need an executable in the folder.In addition to what @Alexander Babaev said , when I had this problem it was because for some reason the build configuration was set to MAC 64 bit (dont know how it got there...) , returned it to IOS and it got enabled again.You need to download the application_tools_1.1.dmgYou can delete your project scheme in "manage schemes \xe2\x80\xa6"  and then click "autocreate schemes now" in the manage schemes window. This gives back the archive option.Had been messing around with this for quite some time too. Don\'t forget to click on \'Validate Settings\' at the bottom after you\'ve checked the \'Prerendered\' tickbox in the summary tab. And if you\'re deploying your app to the iPhone or iPad, make sure you delete the app first and then build it again. Otherwise your icons will still be the same.Quitting and relaunching XCode sometimes helps. It usually does for me, if choosing an iOS device doesn\'t do the trick. First you have to add a ios device then go to product on the top then click it after that you can get enadled Archive option .
