I have an image, and I want to set it a specific width and height (in pixels)But If I set width and height using css (width:150px; height:100px), image will be stretched, and It may be ugly.How to Fill images to a specific size using CSS, and not stretching it?Example of fill and stretching image:Original Image:Stretched Image:Filled Image:Please note that in the Filled image example above: first, image is resized to 150x255 (maintained aspect ratio), and then, it cropped to 150x100.If you want to use the image as a CSS background, there is an elegant solution. Simply use cover or contain in the background-size CSS3 property.While cover will give you a scaled up image, contain will give you a scaled down image. Both will preserve the pixel aspect ratio.http://jsfiddle.net/uTHqs/ (using cover)http://jsfiddle.net/HZ2FT/ (using contain)This approach has the advantage of being friendly to Retina displays as per Thomas Fuchs\' quick guide. http://cl.ly/0v2u190o110RIt\'s worth mentioning that browser support for both attributes excludes IE6-8. http://www.quirksmode.org/css/background.htmlYou can use the css property object-fit. See example hereThere\'s a polyfill for IE: https://github.com/anselmh/object-fitThe only real way is to have a container around your image and use overflow:hidden:HTMLCSSIt\'s a pain in CSS to do what you want and center the image, there is a quick fix in jquery such as:http://jsfiddle.net/x86Q7/2/CSS solution no JS and no background image:Method 1 "margin auto" ( IE8+ - NOT FF!):http://jsfiddle.net/5xjr05dt/Method 2 "transform" ( IE9+ ):http://jsfiddle.net/5xjr05dt/1/Method 2 can be used to center an image in a fixed width / height container. Both can overflow - and if the image is smaller than the container it will still be centered.http://jsfiddle.net/5xjr05dt/3/Method 3 "double wrapper" ( IE8+ - NOT FF! ):http://jsfiddle.net/5xjr05dt/5/Method 4 "double wrapper AND double image" ( IE8+ ):http://jsfiddle.net/5xjr05dt/26/** Method 1 and 3 don\'t seem to work with Firefox **Actually this is just a derivation from the most upvoted answer of this question  (not the accepted one).There are two differences: There is NO need to provide the height and width attributes on the image element, because they will be overriden by the style. so it is enough to write something like this.Providing width:100% on the style.  This is helpful if you are using bootstrap and want the image to stretch all the available width.\nSpecifying the height property is optional, but in my case, it was good thing.Another solution is to put the image in a container with the desired width and height.  Using this method you would not have to set the image as a background image of an element.Then you can do this with an img tag and just set a max-width and max-height on the element.CSS:HTML:Now when you change the size of the container the image will automatically grow as large as it can without going outside the bounds or distorting.If you want to center the image vertically and horizontally you can change the container css to:Here is a JS Fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/9kUYC/2/Building off of @Dominic Green\'s answer using jQuery, here is a solution that should work for images that are either wider than they are high or higher than they are wide.http://jsfiddle.net/grZLR/4/There is probably a more elegant way of doing the JavaScript, but this does work.Try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/D7E3E/4/Using a container with overflow: hiddenEDIT: @Dominic Green beat me.I helped build a jQuery plugin called Fillmore, which handles the background-size: cover in browsers that support it, and has a shim for those that don\'t.  Give it a look!This will Fill images to a specific size, without stretching it or without cropping it
