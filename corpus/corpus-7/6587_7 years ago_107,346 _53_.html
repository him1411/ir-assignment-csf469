What is the difference between require_relative and require in Ruby?Just look at the docs: require_relative complements the builtin method require by allowing you to load a file that is relative to the file containing the require_relative statement.For example, if you have unit test classes in the "test" directory, and data for them under the test "test/data" directory, then you might use a line like this in a test case:From Ruby API:require_relative complements the\n  builtin method require by allowing you\n  to load a file that is relative to the\n  file containing the require_relative\n  statement.When you use require to load a file,\n  you are usually accessing\n  functionality that has been properly\n  installed, and made accessible, in\n  your system. require does not offer a\n  good solution for loading files within\n  the project\xe2\x80\x99s code. This may be useful\n  during a development phase, for\n  accessing test data, or even for\n  accessing files that are "locked" away\n  inside a project, not intended for\n  outside use.For example, if you have unit test\n  classes in the "test" directory, and\n  data for them under the test\n  "test/data" directory, then you might\n  use a line like this in a test case:Since neither\n  "test" nor "test/data" are likely to\n  be in Ruby\xe2\x80\x99s library path (and for\n  good reason), a normal require won\xe2\x80\x99t\n  find them. require_relative is a good\n  solution for this particular problem.You may include or omit the extension\n  (.rb or .so) of the file you are\n  loading.path must respond to to_str.You can find the documentation at http://extensions.rubyforge.org/rdoc/classes/Kernel.htmlrequire_relative is a convenient subset of requireequals:if __FILE__ is defined, or it raises LoadError otherwise.This implies that:require_relative \'a\' and require_relative \'./a\' require relative to the current file (__FILE__).This is what you want to use when requiring inside your library, since you don\'t want the result to depend on the current directory of the caller.eval(\'require_relative("a.rb")\') raises LoadError because __FILE__ is not defined inside eval.This is why you can\'t use require_relative in RSpec tests, which get evaled. The following operations are only possible with require:require \'./a.rb\' requires relative to the current directoryrequire \'a.rb\' uses the search path ($LOAD_PATH) to require. It does not find files relative to current directory or path.This is not possible with require_relative because the docs say that path search only happens when "the filename does not resolve to an absolute path" (i.e. starts with / or ./ or ../), which is always the case for File.expand_path.The following operation is possible with both, but you will want to use require as it is shorter and more efficient:Reading the sourceWhen the docs are not clear, I recommend that you take a look at the sources (toggle source in the docs). In some cases, it helps to understand what is going on.require:require_relative:This allows us to conclude thatis the same as:because:require uses the current directory that you are running the program from  require_relative uses the directory of where that program itself residesFor example, if a program is in ~/code and is called 1.rb and you\'ve done a cd to that directoryand you try and run the ruby program withthen within 1.rbboth will work.However if you are in another directory, sayand you try and run the program withthen you will get an error such aswhen trying to usewhereas usingstill works ok _because the reference (to 3.rb) is relative to which directory the program (1.rb) is located in.I just saw the RSpec\'s code has some comment on require_relative being O(1) constant and require being O(N) linear. So probably the difference is that require_relative is the preferred one than require.The top answers are correct, but deeply technical.  For those newer to the Ruby--for example, what if you have data in ~/my-project/data.rb and you want to include that in ~/my-project/solution.rb?  in solution.rb you would add require_relative \'data\'.it is important to note these files do not need to be in the same directory.  require_relative \'../../folder1/folder2/data\' is also valid.for example, what if you want to use one of the helper functions provided in the active_support library?  you\'ll need to install the gem with gem install activesupport and then in the file require \'active_support\'.Said differently--require_relative requires a file specifically pointed to relative to the file that calls it. require requires a file included in the $LOAD_PATH.I want to add that when using windows you can use require \'./1.rb\' if the script is run local or from a mapped network drive but when run from an UNC \\servername\\sharename\\folder path you need to use require_relative \'./1.rb\'\nI don\'t mingle in the discussion which to use for other reasons.
