I\'m running Windows 7 French and I\'m trying to compile this really basic program, but Visual Studio is being stubborn and refuses to comply. I also tried compiling it with both GCC 4.7 and Clang trunk on Coliru and I get more or less the same errors (output is below the code), though I think Coliru runs on an English OS so I wouldn\'t expect it to work anyway.What am I doing wrong? And how can I fix it?Many problems are due to caching, but yours is one of the other kind of hard problems: naming things. Yes, localization is hard.You didn\'t mention which variant of French you\'re using, but from the error message, I think you\'re using \xe2\x80\x9cFrench (France)\xe2\x80\x9d (what we users of civilized OSes call fr_FR). MS\'s fr_FR locale behaves in a very weird way: uppercase accented letters are mapped to their unaccented counterpart (for backward compatibility with some typewriter models). So you need to write SORTIE_SUCCES instead of SORTIE_SUCC\xc3\x88S.A workaround is to use the \xe2\x80\x9cFrench (Monaco)\xe2\x80\x9d (fr_MC) language, where uppercase accented letters work as expected. Unfortunately, the Monaco version of the compiler is very very expensive. You could also use the Canadian French, Belgian French or Swiss French version, but these all require that you submit a bilingual (fr_CA + en_CA), trilingual (fr_BE +  nl_BE + de_BE) or quadrilingual (fr_CH + it_CH + de_CH + rm_CH) source file. African variants of French are out because they are too poor to afford a C++ compiler, however you could use C instead.Then there are other syntax errors in your program:I wollun tried the following code in the C++ compiler included in \xc3\x89maxe 51,70, and it wollun worked:Some languages have better internationalization support than C++. For example, here\'s a program in LOGO (not to be confused with LOGO of course).The problem is obviously that you are including the wrong standard header:should be:Also, you\'ll find that this works much better is you use Studio Visuel Micromou  or the CCG (stands for "Collection de Compilateurs GPU", btw) tools, rather than their more common MVS or GCC relatives.You have a semantic error - the second argument of the entry function should be of type cara**, not ent**:For the <iostream> error, @MartinJ. already correctly pointed out you should be using <esflux> instead.Regarding the other errors, it seems your compiler is simply on strike. This can happen occasionally when compiling french code, and should fix itself in a few days.I\'m trying to compile this really basic program.This is not a BASIC program, so Visual Studio does not know what to do with it.In addition, on a French system, you need to pass a programme to the compiler.Hello L\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa8ret\xc3\xa9 fait la course en orbite,I\'d like to emphasize that even though you follow all the answers given here, your program still won\'t compile because of your punctuation. Semicolons are preceded by a non-breaking space in French.I would recommend the following:Please notice I changed argn to narg, as it is more natural in French (nothing to do with hungarian notations though)!Edit: followed angew\'s recommendationPretty much everything\'s been covered in the previous answers, but if I may add:this is certes allowed, but the following is usually preferred:You need to reference the french pre-processor :hummm... too late, it is deprecated. The new release will be available this week.I realize this doesn\'t apply to this particular situation, but it\'s important to keep in mind the gender of your objects when programming in French.  There are 2 types of classes (genre) genre::masculins and genre::f\xc3\xa9mininFor instance:Furthermore, when passing this to another function the function call is prefixed with the parameter list rather than suffixed:orFor further reference: Wikipedia Word OrderWhat if you retry after lunch hours (12-2 pm) ? Also, if you get more then one processors, they may be on strike. You can get your proc back however with this (French) Windows 7 command:Repeat when you\'re stuck (but don\'t forget to lower the number each time!).Seems you forgot to install the FrenChPP++ package. After a successful installation (you will need to compile FrenChPP++ on a standard c++ compiler if there are no binary packages for your system (we at the Unauthorized Frog recommend using g++ for this, but feel free to use clang too, but ignore the warnings)) you will need to create a new project, and just copy paste this into the newly created principal.fcpp file. Then upon execution the FrenChPP++ precompiler (which works very similarly to the way Qt handles its signals/slot mechanism) will parse all .fcpp files and will "translate" the .fcpp into valid .cpp and then compile them using your system default compiler.You probably need to install the French language pack for C++11. If you can\'t find it, try http://www.bing.com/translator.There are so many errors in your code, most of them have already been adressed in the other answers. But don\'t you know that the creators of C++ designed it so that program source code doesn\'t get obverly long when translated?It\'s not std::cendehors, but std::deh (short for dehors) as std::cin translates to std::ded (for dedans). Also note there used to be compilers that didn\'t automatically flush on \\n, so it\'s better to use std::findl (fin de ligne). So it should be like this:EDIT: Sorry, I didn\'t spot another mistake. The correct form of course is using guillemets like this:You cannot use French keywords in a C++ (or C) program. You should codeand likewiseand of course code int main(int argc, char**argv)  etc...(thanks for your April fool\'s joke!)Since Mr. George Bush banned French Fries in favour of the tastier Liberty Fries (and the less-tasty but equally patriotic Freedom Fries), other American corporations are also removing support for French in their products.You need to use a pre-2003 compiler, or send a mail to http://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/submit-questions-and-comments to ask if they plan to revert the situation soon.Firstly, you need tobefore you\'re able to use SORTIE_SUCC\xc3\x88S constant.Another problem with your C++ code is that you\'ve forgotten to use std::lend and instead used \'\\n\' in your output string - it won\'t work in French code, obviously, only code written in English and Russian is allowed to do that.Even more, you used wrong indentation (GCC on French requires tabs instead of spaces) and brace placement (you need to place braces on the same line whenever possible, no spaces between them allowed); keeping them unchanged will generate "vous ne connaissez pas votre tabulation, Jacques" and "pas assez d\'amour entre accolades" runtime errors in your code.After I changed those lines, the code successfully compiled. It still hasn\'t run, probably for the reasons specified here.Snippet: http://ideone.fr/sQbL6E
