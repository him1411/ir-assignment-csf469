This is a much discussed issue for OSX 10.6 users, but I haven\'t been able to find a solution that works. Here\'s my setup:Python 2.6.1 64bit\nDjango 1.2.1\nMySQL 5.1.47 osx10.6 64bitI create a virtualenvwrapper with --no-site-packages, then installed Django. When I activate the virtualenv and run python manage.py syncdb, I get this error:I\'ve also installed the MySQL for Python adapter, but to no avail (maybe I installed it improperly?). Anyone dealt with this before?I had the same error and pip install MySQL-python solved it for me.Alternate installs:Below, Soli notes that if you receive the following error:EnvironmentError: mysql_config not found... then you have a further system dependency issue. Solving this will vary from system to system, but for Debian-derived systems:sudo apt-get install python-mysqldbRunning Ubuntu, I had to do:Adding to other answers, the following helped me finish the installation mysql-python:virtualenv, mysql-python, pip: anyone know how?On Ubuntu...Don\'t forget to add \'sudo\' to the beginning of commands if you don\'t have the proper permissions.Try this the commands below. They work for me:mysql_config must be on the path. On Mac, doraised an error:EnvironmentError: mysql_config not foundfixed the problem.Try this: This solved the issue for me .pip install MySQL-pythonHow I got it working:After sourcing my env:Then, I ran the startproject and inside the manage.py, I added this:Also, updated this inside settings:I also have configparser==3.5.0 installed in my virtualenv, not sure if that was required or not...Hope it helps, This issue was the result of an incomplete / incorrect installation of the MySQL for Python adapter. Specifically, I had to edit the path to the mysql_config file to point to /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config - discussed in greater detail in this article: http://dakrauth.com/blog/entry/python-and-django-setup-mac-os-x-leopard/The following worked perfectly for me, running Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit:Now, navigate to your virtualenv (such as env folder) and execute the following:I actually found the solution in a separate question and I am quoting it below:If you have created the virtualenv with the --no-site-packages switch\n  (the default), then system-wide installed additions such as MySQLdb\n  are not included in the virtual environment packages.You need to install MySQLdb with the pip command installed with the\n  virtualenv. Either activate the virtualenv with the bin/activate\n  script, or use bin/pip from within the virtualenv to install the\n  MySQLdb library locally as well.Alternatively, create a new virtualenv with system site-packages\n  included by using the --system-site-package switch.I think this should also work with OSX. The only problem would be getting an equivalent command for installing libmysqlclient-dev and python-dev as they are needed to compile \nmysql-python I guess.Hope this helps.This worked for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.4sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb works perfectly in ubuntupip install mysql-python raises an Environment ErrorYou can install as  pip install mysqlclientpip did not work for me on windows 8 64 bits system. \neasy_install mysql-python works for me.\nYou can use easy_install to avoid building binaries on windows if pip does not work. I made the upgrade to OSX Mavericks and Pycharm 3 and start to get this error, i used pip and easy install and got the error: command\'/usr/bin/clang\' failed with exit status 1.So i need to update to Xcode 5 and tried again to install using pip.That fix all the problems.I had the same problem on OSX 10.6.6. But just a simple easy_install mysql-python on terminal did not solve it as another hiccup followed:error: command \'gcc-4.2\' failed with exit status 1. Apparently, this issue arises after upgrading from XCode3 (which is natively shipped with OSX 10.6) to XCode4. This newer ver removes support for building ppc arch. If its the same case, try doing as follows before easy_install mysql-pythonMany thanks to Ned Deily for this solution. Check hereThe error raised here is in importing the python module. This can be solved by adding the python site-packages folder to the environment variable $PYTHONPATH on OS X. So we can add the following command to the .bash_profile file:*replace x.x with the python version you are usingIf you are using python3, then try this(My OS is Ubuntu 16.04):For me the problem got solved by simply reinstalling mysql-pythonInstall Command Line Tools Works for me:I overcame the same problem by installing MySQL-python library using pip. You can see the message displayed on my console when I first changed my database settings in settings.py and executed makemigrations command(The solution is following the below message, just see that).Finally I overcame this problem as follows:
