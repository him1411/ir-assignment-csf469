I was thinking if exist a better/nicer way to negate a instanceof in Java.\nActually, I do something like:But, I think that should exist a "beautiful" syntax to do this.Someone know if it exists and how the syntax look like?EDIT:\nBy beautiful, I might say something like this:No, there is no better way; yours is canonical.I don\'t know what you imagine when you say "beautiful", but what about this? I personally think it\'s worse than the classic form you posted, but somebody might like it...You could use the Class.isInstance method:... but it is still negated and pretty ugly.Usually you don\'t want just an if but an else clause as well.can be written asOr you can write the code so you don\'t need to know if its a String or not. e.g.can be written asIf you can use static imports, and your moral code allows themAnd then...This is just a fluent interface exercise, I\'d never use that in real life code!\nGo for your classic way, it won\'t confuse anyone else reading your code!ok just my two cents, use a is string method:Or simply if-else...
