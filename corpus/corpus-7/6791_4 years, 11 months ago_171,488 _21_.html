I\'m trying to create get and set method for a property:What\'s the keyword to set a value?Typescript uses getter/setter syntax that is like ActionScript3.  That will produce this Javascript, using the Ecmascript 5 Object.defineProperty() feature.So to use it,However, in order to use it at all, you must make sure the TypeScript compiler targets ECMAScript5.  If you are running the command line compiler, use --target flag like this;tsc --target ES5If you are using Visual Studio, you must edit your project file to add the flag to the configuration for the TypeScriptCompile build tool.  You can see that here:As @DanFromGermany suggests below, if your are simply reading and writing a local property like foo.bar = true, then having a setter and getter pair is overkill.  You can always add them later if you need to do something, like logging, whenever the property is read or written. Here\'s a working example that should point you in the right direction:Getters and setters in JavaScript are just normal functions. The setter is a function that takes a parameter whose value is the value being set.Ezward has already provided a good answer, but I noticed that one of the comments asks how it is used. For people like me who stumble across this question, I thought it would be useful to have a link to the official documentation on getters and setters on the Typescript website as that explains it well, will hopefully always stay up-to-date as changes are made, and shows example usage:http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.htmlIn particular, for those not familiar with it, note that you don\'t incorporate the word \'get\' into a call to a getter (and similarly for setters):\nYou should simply do this:given a class like:then the \'bar\' getter for the private \'_bar\' property will be called.You can write thisIt is very similar to creating common methods, simply put the keyword reserved get or set at the beginning.  In this case you can skip return type in get getMethod1() { Hi All you can change your compiler option in Visual studio code editor by writing: tsc --target ES5 Filename.ts
