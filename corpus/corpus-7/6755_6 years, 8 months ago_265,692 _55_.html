I want to have 2 models in one view. The page contains both LoginViewModel and RegisterViewModel.e.g.Do I need to make another ViewModel which holds these 2 ViewModels?I need the validation attributes to be brought forward to the view, this is why I need the ViewModels.Isn\'t there another way such as (without the BigViewModel):with your BigViewModel\nyou do: you can create 2 additional viewsLogin.cshtmland register.cshtml same thingafter creation you have to render them in the main view and pass them the viewmodel/viewdataso it could be like this:orusing ajax parts of your web-site become more independentiframes, but probably this is not the caseI\'d recommend using Html.RenderAction and PartialViewResults to accomplish this; it will allow you to display the same data, but each partial view would still have a single view model and removes the need for a BigViewModelSo your view contain something like the following:Where Login & Register are both actions in your controller defined like the following:The Login & Register would then be user controls residing in either the current View folder, or in the Shared folder and would like something like this:/Views/Shared/Login.cshtml: (or /Views/MyView/Login.cshtml)/Views/Shared/Register.cshtml: (or /Views/MyView/Register.cshtml)And there you have a single controller action, view and view file for each action with each totally distinct and not reliant upon one another for anything.Another way is to use:I have explained how to use this method both in the view and controller for another example: Two models in one view in ASP MVC 3In your case you could implement it using the following code:In the view:Note that I have manually changed the Name attributes for each property when building the form. This needs to be done, otherwise it wouldn\'t get properly mapped to the method\'s parameter of type model when values are sent to the associated method for processing. I would suggest using separate methods to process these forms separately, for this example I used Login1 and Login2 methods. Login1 method requires to have a parameter of type RegisterViewModel and Login2 requires a parameter of type LoginViewModel.if an actionlink is required you can use:in the controller\'s method for the view, a variable of type Tuple needs to be created and then passed to the view.Example:or you can fill the two instances of LoginViewModel and RegisterViewModel with values and then pass it to the view. Use a view model that contains multiple view models:In your view:Do I need to make another view which holds these 2 views?Isn\'t there another way such as (without the BigViewModel):Yes, you can use Tuple (brings magic in view having multiple model).Code:Add this ModelCollection.cs to your ModelsController:The View:I want to say that my solution was like the answer provided on this stackoverflow page:   ASP.NET MVC 4, multiple models in one view?However, in my case, the linq query they used in their Controller did not work for me.This is said query:Consequently, "in your view just specify that you\'re using a collection of view models" did not work for me either.However, a slight variation on that solution did work for me. Here is my solution in case this helps anyone.Here is my view model in which I know I will have just one team but that team may have multiple boards (and I have a ViewModels folder within my Models folder btw, hence the namespace):Now this is my controller. This is the most significant difference from the solution in the link referenced above. I build out the ViewModel to send to the view differently.Then in my view I do not specify it as a list. I just do "@model TaskBoard.Models.ViewModels.TeamBoards" Then I only need a for each when I iterate over the Team\'s boards. Here is my view:I am fairly new to ASP.NET MVC so it took me a little while to figure this out. So, I hope this post helps someone figure it out for their project in a shorter timeframe. :-)Create one new class in your model and properties of LoginViewModel and RegisterViewModel:Then use UserDefinedModel in your view.a simple way to do that we can call all model firstthen send your model with viewbagand in view then easily use this like Model
