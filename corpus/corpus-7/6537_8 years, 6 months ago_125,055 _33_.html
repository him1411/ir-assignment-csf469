This is not a question - posting it here for reference:When consuming a WebService, I got the following error: Request format is unrecognized for URL unexpectedly ending in /myMethodNameFound a solution on this websiteAll you need is to add the following to your web.configMore info from MicrosoftDespite 90% of all the information I found (while trying to find a solution to this error) telling me to add the HttpGet and HttpPost to the configuration, that did not work for me... and didn\'t make sense to me anyway.My application is running on lots of servers (30+) and I\'ve never had to add this configuration for any of them.  Either the version of the application running under .NET 2.0 or .NET 4.0.The solution for me was to re-register ASP.NET against IIS.I used the following command line to achieve this...Make sure you\'re using right method: Post/Get, right content type and right parameters (data).Superb.Case 2 - where the same issue can arrise) in my case the problem was due to the following line:It works well in server as calls are made directly to the webservice function - however will fail if you run the service directly from .Net in the debug environment and want to test running the function manually.For the record I was getting this error when I moved an old app from one server to another.  I added the <add name="HttpGet"/> <add name="HttpPost"/> elements to the web.config, which changed the error to:In order to fix this error I had to add the ScriptHandlerFactory lines to web.config:Why it worked without these lines on one web server and not the other I don\'t know.I did not have the issue when developing in localhost.  However, once I published to a web server, the webservice was returning an empty (blank) result and I was seeing the error in my logs.  I fixed it by setting my ajax contentType to :and using :on the object I was posting.In html you have to enclose the call in a a form with a GET with something likeYou can also use a POST with the action being the location of the web service and input the parameter via an input tag.There are also SOAP and proxy classes.In my case i had an overload of function that was causing this Exception, once i changed the name of my second function it ran ok, guess web server doesnot support function overloadingI use following line of code to fix this problem. Write the following code in web.config file I also got this error with apache mod-mono. It looks like the documentation page for webservice is not implemented yet in linux. But the webservice is working despite this error. You should see it by adding ?WSDL at the end of url, i.e http://localhost/WebService1.asmx?WSDLMake sure you disable custom errors. This can mask the original problem in your code:changetoa WebMethod which requires a ContextKey,when this key is not set, got the exception. Fixing it by assigning AutoCompleteExtender\'s key.
