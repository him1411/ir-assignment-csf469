Is there a MySQL command to locate the my.cnf configuration file, similar to how PHP\'s phpinfo()  locates its php.ini?There is no internal MySQL command to trace this, it\'s a little too abstract.  The file might be in 5 (or more?) locations, and they would all be valid because they load cascading.Those are the default locations MySQL looks at.  If it finds more than one, it will load each of them & values override each other (in the listed order, I think).  Also, the --defaults-file parameter can override the whole thing, so... basically, it\'s a huge pain in the butt.But thanks to it being so confusing, there\'s a good chance it\'s just in /etc/my.cnf.(if you just want to see the values: SHOW VARIABLES, but you\'ll need the permissions to do so.)You can actually ask MySQL to show you the list of all locations where it searches for my.cnf (or my.ini on Windows). It is not an SQL command though. Rather, execute:In the very first lines you will find a message with a list of all my.cnf locations it looks for. On my machine it is:Or, on Windows:Note however, that it might be that there is no my.cnf file at any of these locations. So, you can create the file on your own - use one of the sample config files provided with MySQL distribution (on Linux - see /usr/share/mysql/*.cnf files and use whichever is appropriate for you - copy it to /etc/my.cnf and then modify as needed).Also, note that there is also a command line option --defaults-file which may define custom path to my.cnf or my.ini file. For example, this is the case for MySQL 5.5 on Windows - it points to a my.ini file in the data directory, which is not normally listed with mysqld --help --verbose. On Windows - see service properties to find out if this is the case for you.Finally, check the http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/option-files.html - it is described there in more details.You could always run find in a terminal.You can use :This might work:on my machine this outputs:So it looks like /etc/mysql/my.cnf is the one since it stat64() and read() were successful.By default, mysql search my.cnf first at /etc folder. If there is no /etc/my.cnf file inside this folder, I advise you to create new one in this folder as indicated by the documentation (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/option-files.html).You can also search for existing my.cnf furnished by your mysql installation. You can launch the following commandYou can use the following configuration file with myisam table and without innodb mysql support (from port installation of mysql on mac os x maverick). Please verify each command in this configuration file.As noted by konyak you can get the list of places mysql will look for your my.cnf file by running mysqladmin --help. Since this is pretty verbose you can get to the part you care about quickly with:This will give you output similar to:Depending on how you installed mysql it is possible that none of these files are present yet. You can cat them in order to see how your config is being built and create your own my.cnf if needed at your preferred location.If you\'re on a Mac with Homebrew, use brew info mysqlYou\'ll see something like That last line is the INSTALLERDIR per the MySQL docsI don\'t know how you\'ve setup MySQL on your Linux environment but have you checked?Try running mysqld --help --verbose | grep my.cnf | tr " " "\\n"Output will be something likeAnother option is to use the whereis command.E.g. whereis my.cnfFound mine usingall great suggestions, in my case i didn\'t find it in any of those locations, but in /usr/share/mysql, i have a RHEL VM and i installed mysql5.5For Ubuntu 16: /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf I installed xampp bundle with apache, php and mysql in ubuntu. There my.cnf file is located in /opt/lampp/etc/ folder. Hope it\'ll help somebody.Answered for only MySQL Workbench users,If you are using MAMP, access Templates > MySQL (my.cnf) > [version]If you are running MAMP windowless you may need to customize the toolbar using the Customize button.
