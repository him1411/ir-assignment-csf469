Programming in vim I often go search for something, yank it, then go back to where I was, insert it, modify it.The problem is that after I search and find, I need to MANUALLY find my way back to where I was.Is there an automatic way to go back to where I was when I initiated my last search?Ctrl+O takes me to the previous location. Don\'t know about location before the search.Edit: Also, `. will take you to the last change you made.Use `` to jump back to the exact position you were in before you searched/jumped, or \'\' to jump back to the start of the line you were on before you searched/jumped.I\'ve always done by it setting a mark.In command-mode, press m [letter].  For example, m a sets a mark at the current line using a as the mark indentifier.To get back to the mark press \' [letter].  For example, \' a takes you back to the mark set in step 1.To see all of the marks that currently set, type :marks.On a slightly unrelated note, I just discovered another nifty thing about marks.Let\'s say you jump to mark b by doing \'b.  Vim automatically sets the mark \' (that\'s a single-quote) to be whichever line you were on before jumping to mark b.That means you can do \'b to jump to that mark, then do \'\' (2 single-quotes) to jump back to whever you were before.I discovered this accidentally using the :marks command, which shows a list of all marks.You really should read :help jumplist it explains all of this very well.CTRL+O and CTRL+I, for jumping back and forward.I use this one:Then if I search something by using / or ?, I can go back quickly by `s. You could replace the letter s to any letter you like.The simplest way is to set a mark, with m[letter], then go back to it with \'[letter]
