I have the name of the "sort by property" in a string. I will need to use Lambda/Linq to sort the list of objects.Ex:This can be done asThe .NET framework is casting the lambda (emp1,emp2)=>int as a Comparer<Employee>.This has the advantage of being strongly typed. One thing you could do is change Sort so it makes better use of lambdas.Now you can specify the field to sort when calling the Sort method.You could use Reflection to get the value of the property.Where TypeHelper has a static method like:You might also want to look at  Dynamic LINQ from the VS2008 Samples library.  You could use the IEnumerable extension to cast the List as an IQueryable and then use the Dynamic link OrderBy extension.Building the order by expression can be read hereShamelessly stolen from the page in link:This is how I solved my problem:You could use reflection to access the property.NotesSort uses the IComparable interface, if the type implements it.\nAnd you can avoid the ifs by implementing a custom IComparer:and then Answer for 1.:You should be able to manually build an expression tree that can be passed into OrderBy using the name as a string. Or you could use reflection as suggested in another answer, which might be less work.Edit: Here is a working example of building an expression tree manually. (Sorting on X.Value, when only knowing the name "Value" of the property). You could (should) build a generic method for doing it.Building an expression tree requires you to know the particpating types, however. That might or might not be a problem in your usage scenario. If you don\'t know what type you should be sorting on, it will propably be easier using reflection.Answer for 2.:Yes, since Comparer<T>.Default will be used for the comparison, if you do not explicitly define the comparer.The solution provided by Rashack does not work for value types (int, enums, etc.) unfortunately.For it to work with any type of property, this is the solution I found:Another one, this time for any IQueryable:You can pass multiple sort criteria, like this:
