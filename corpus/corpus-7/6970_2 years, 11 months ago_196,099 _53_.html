I\'m trying to figure out the right way to use a custom font for the toolbar title, and center it in the toolbar (client requirement).At the moment, i\'m using the good old ActionBar, and I was setting the title to empty value, and using setCustomView to put my custom font TextView and center it using ActionBar.LayoutParams.Is there a better way to do that? Using the new Toolbar as my ActionBar.To use a custom title in your Toolbar all you need to do is remember is that Toolbar is just a fancy ViewGroup so you can add a custom title like so:This means that you can style the TextView however you would like because it\'s just a regular TextView. So in your activity you can access the title like so:The ToolBar title is stylable. Any customization you make has to be made in the theme. I\'ll give you an example.Toolbar layout:Styles:we don\'t have direct access to the ToolBar title TextView so we use reflection to access it.Here is title text dependant approach to find TextView instance from Toolbar.This\'s just to help to join all pieces using @MrEngineer13 answer with @Jonik and  @Rick Sanchez comments with the right order to help to achieve title centered easly!!The layout with TextAppearance.AppCompat.Widget.ActionBar.Title :The way to achieve with the right order:Please don\'t forget to upvote @MrEngineer13 answer !!!Here is a sample project ToolbarCenterTitleSampleHope to help somebody else ;)No one has mentioned this, but there are some attributes for Toolbar:app:titleTextColor for setting the title text colorapp:titleTextAppearance for setting the title text appearanceapp:titleMargin for setting the marginAnd there are other specific-side margins such as marginStart, etc.Without toolbar TextView we can customize font by using below codeI use this solution:Layout:Code:You can use like the followingI don\'t know if anything changed in the appcompat library but it\'s fairly trivial, no need for reflection.Solution that I used for this problem:For center gravity I think it would be necessary to change layout params to match_parent horizontally and then:I solved this solution , And this is a following codes: And you can change title/label , in Activity, write a below codes:TextView mTitle = (TextView) toolbarTop.findViewById(R.id.toolbar_title);\nmTitle.setText("@string/....");Even though adding a text view to the toolbar can solve the problem of the restriction of title styling, there is an issue with it. Since we are not adding it to a layout, we do not have too much control over its width. We can either use wrap_content or match_parent. Now consider a scenario where we have a searchView as a button on the right edge of the toolbar. If the title contents are more, it will go on top of the button obscuring it. There is no way of controlling this short of setting a width to the label and is something you don\'t want to do if you want to have a responsive design.So, here is a solution that worked for me which is slightly different from adding a textview to the toolbar. Instead of that, add the toolbar and text view to a relative layout and ensure that the text view is on top of the toolbar. Then we can use appropriate margins and make sure the text view shows up where we want it to show up.Make sure you set the toolbar to not show the title.Here is the XML for this solution:Solves the issue @ankur-chaudhary mentioned above.TrySetting android:gravity="center" worked for meNo styling nothing. Toolbar is basically a ViewGroup all you need to do is set gravity of elements in it.Since android.support.v7.appcompat 24.2 Toolbar has method setTitleTextAppearance and you can set its font without external textview.create new style in styles.xmland use itDefine the following class:...and then just use it instead of regular Toolbar like this:You still need these 2 lines of code in your Activity (as with standard Toolbar):That\'s it! You don\'t need to hide the standard left-aligned title, don\'t need to duplicate the same XML code over and over, etc., just use CenteredToolbar like if it was default Toolbar. You can also set your custom font programatically since you now have direct access to the TextView. Hope this helps.None of the above solutions worked for me. I found that only by overriding the default Actionbar behavior could I implement my custom view.Try this code:getSupportActionBar().setDisplayOptions(ActionBar.DISPLAY_SHOW_CUSTOM);\ngetSupportActionBar().setCustomView(R.layout.toolbar_home);Other Tutorial:
