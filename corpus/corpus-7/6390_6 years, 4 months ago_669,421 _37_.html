I have a data frame called "newprice" (see below) and I want to change the column names in my program in R.In fact this is what am doing:I have not put this in a loop because I want each column name to be different as you see.When I paste my program into R console this is the output it gives me:I have equally tried using the c() function-for example c("premium"), instead of the paste() function, but to no avail.Could someone help me to figure this out?Use the colnames() function:You can also subset:I use this:The error is caused by the "smart-quotes" (or whatever they\'re called).  The lesson here is, "don\'t write your code in an \'editor\' that converts quotes to smart-quotes".Also, you don\'t need paste("premium") (the call to paste is redundant) and it\'s a good idea to put spaces around <- to avoid confusion (e.g. x <- -10; if(x<-3) "hi" else "bye"; x).Did you try just: names(newprice)[1]<-"premium"?The new recommended way to do this is to use the setNames function.  See \n?setNames.  Since this creates a new copy of the data.frame, be sure to assign the result to the original data.frame, if that is your intention.Newer versions of R will give you warning if you use colnames in some of the ways suggested by earlier answers.If this were a data.table instead, you could use the data.table function setnames, which can modify specific column names or a single column name by reference:I had the same issue and this piece of code worked out for me.In short, this code does the following:names(data) looks into all the names in the dataframe (data)[names(data) == oldVariableName] extracts the variable name (oldVariableName) you want to get renamed and <- "newVariableName" assigns the new variable name.Similar to the others:Quite simple and easy to modify.You can just do the editing by:and change the column name manually.try:If you need to rename not all but multiple column at once when you only know the old column names you can use colnames function and %in% operator. Example:Now you want to change "bad" and "worst" to "good" and "best". You can use This results in Just to correct and slightly extend Scott Wilson answer.\nYou can use data.table\'s setnames function on data.frames too.  Do not expect speed up of the operation but you can expect the setnames to be more efficient for memory consumption as it updates column names by reference. This can be tracked with address function, see below.  So if you are hitting your memory limits you may consider to use this one instead.You could straightaway have done The paste command that you are using takes 2 arguments atleast. It works like concatenate function in excel which is why it is giving you an error i think.This may be helpful:df=rename.columns(df,list(old.column=\'new.column.name\'))
