How to write :hover and :visited condition for a:before?I\'m trying a:before:hover but it\'s not workingThis depends on what you\'re actually trying to do.If you simply wish to apply styles to a :before pseudo-element when the a element matches a pseudo-class, you need to write a:hover:before or a:visited:before instead. Notice the pseudo-element comes after the pseudo-class (and in fact, at the very end of the entire selector). Notice also that they are two different things; calling them both "pseudo-selectors" is going to confuse you once you run into syntax problems such as this one.If you\'re writing CSS3, you can denote a pseudo-element with double colons to make this distinction clearer. Hence, a:hover::before and a:visited::before. But if you\'re developing for legacy browsers such as IE8 and older, then you can get away with using single colons just fine.This specific order of pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements is stated in the spec:One pseudo-element may be appended to the last sequence of simple selectors in a selector.A sequence of simple selectors is a chain of simple selectors that are not separated by a combinator. It always begins with a type selector or a universal selector. No other type selector or universal selector is allowed in the sequence.A simple selector is either a type selector, universal selector, attribute selector, class selector, ID selector, or pseudo-class. A pseudo-class is a simple selector. A pseudo-element, however, is not, even though it resembles a simple selector.However, for user-action pseudo-classes such as :hover1, if you need this effect to apply only when the user interacts with the pseudo-element itself but not the a element, then this is not possible other than through some obscure layout-dependent workaround. As implied by the text, standard CSS pseudo-elements cannot currently have pseudo-classes. In that case, you will need to apply :hover to an actual child element instead of a pseudo-element.1 Of course, this does not apply to link pseudo-classes such as :visited as in the question, since pseudo-elements aren\'t links.Write a:hover::before instead of a::before:hover: example.To change menu link\'s text on mouseover. (Different language text on hover)\nhere is the jsfiddle examplehtml:css:BoltClock\'s answer is correct. The only thing I want to append is that if you want to only select the pseudo element, put in a span. For example: instead of:This way you can simply saywhich will only highlight the pseudo element, not the entire li elementTry to use .card-listing:hover::after hover and after using :: it wil workYou can also restrict your action to just one class using the right pointed bracket (">"), as I have done in this code:Note: The hover:before switch works only on the .test1 class
