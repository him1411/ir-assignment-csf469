What is the simplest way to reverse this ArrayList?Example (Reference):Not the simplest way but if you\'re a fan of recursion you might be interested in the following method to reverse an ArrayList:Or non-recursively:Solution without using extra ArrayList or combination of add() and remove() methods. Both can have negative impact if you have to reverse a huge list. A little more readable :)Another recursive solutionJust in case we are using Java 8, then we can make use of Stream. The ArrayList is random access list and we can get a stream of elements in reverse order and then collect it into a new ArrayList.The above approach is not suitable for LinkedList as that is not random-access. We can also make use of instanceof to check as well. The trick here is defining "reverse". One can modify the list in place, create a copy in reverse order, or create a view in reversed order. The simplest way, intuitively speaking, is Collections.reverse:This method modifies the list in place. That is, Collections.reverse takes the list and overwrites its elements, leaving no unreversed copy behind. This is suitable for some use cases, but not for others; furthermore, it assumes the list is modifiable. If this is acceptable, we\'re good.If not, one could create a copy in reverse order:This approach works, but requires iterating over the list twice. The copy constructor (new ArrayList<>(list)) iterates over the list, and so does Collections.reverse. We can rewrite this method to iterate only once, if we\'re so inclined:This is more efficient, but also more verbose.Alternatively, we can rewrite the above to use Java 8\'s stream API, which some people find more concise and legible than the above:nb. that Collectors.toList() makes very few guarantees about the result list. If you want to ensure the result comes back as an ArrayList, use Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new) instead.The third option is to create a view in reversed order. This is a more complicated solution, and worthy of further reading/its own question. Guava\'s Lists#reverse method is a viable starting point.Choosing a "simplest" implementation is left as an exercise for the reader.
