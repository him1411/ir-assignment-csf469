I was trying to update the existing pods with pod install command, but it takes forever to run.The verbose mode shows it was stuck at the following line (forever)Updating spec repo master$ /usr/bin/git pull --no-rebase --no-commitThere are no network activity after it get stuck.I ran into the same problem, and I solved it by running the following commands which is given hereyou can runto see what\'s going on behind the scenes.. at least you\'ll know where it\'s stuck at (it could be a git clone operation that\'s taking too long because of your slow network etc)to have an even better idea of why it seems to be stuck (running verbose can get you something like thisis to find out the size of the git repo you\'re cloning.. if you\'re cloning from github.. you can use this format:so for example to find out about the above repo type and the returned json will have a size key, value.. so the above returned which is approx 90mb.. no wonder it\'s taking for ever! (btw.. by the time i wrote this.. it just finished.. ha!)update:\none common thing that cocoapods does before it even starts downloading the dependencies listed in your podfile, is to download/update its own repo (they call it Setting up Cocoapods Master repo.. look at this:the bad news is that if you follow the above procedure to find out how big the cocoapod repo is.. you\'ll get this: "size": 614373,.. which is alot.so to get a more accurate way of knowing how long it takes to just install your own repo.. you can set up the cocoapods master repo separately by using pod setup:then running pod installOpen terminal and type:Remove all the pods from your project (tricky part):ManuallyAutomatically using CocoaPods De-IntegrateInstallRunHere we are going through at installing the Pods again Change your location your directoryEdit podfile by adding lines you need to itorFINALLY install the pod againHope this helpsI found another way to solve the problempod install --verbose --no-repo-updateit works for me.As pointed out here git-remote-http process running in background. I goto this process from Activity Monitor and quitting this process resumed the pod process which was stuck on "Updating local specs repositories" after POD INSTALL   As of 15th August 2016, the repo is a massive 2.39GB file. I opened the Activity Monitor to look at what the terminal was doing. It was downloading this huge file.Try clearing your CocoaPods cache, re-download and re-install all pods as described hereThis is what worked for me : I recommend using the --verbose flag since Terminal is not great when giving progress on a command action. The verbose option helps a lot!Just go through the below step-by-step:Download https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/archive/master.zipRUN the Below commands in terminal:pod setup --verboseOpen new tab in the terminal and RUNmv ~/.cocoapods/repos/master/.git ~/tempSpecsGitFolderopen master.zip (unzipping it)mv Specs-master ~/.cocoapods/repos/mastermv ~/tempSpecsGitFolder ~/.cocoapods/repos/master/.gitcd [project folder]pod install --no-repo-updateAs mentioned in other answers, It takes forever because the size of cocoapods master repo is huge. This time can be reduced using the following steps. 1) Create a private specs file path on your github repository. Provide this path https://github.com/yourpathForspecs.git\' as a source in your podfile. 2) identify ALL the repositories You need and their dependencies( mentioned in the podspec.json file on cocoapods for these repositories) and get their podspec.json files from cocoapods. add these podspec.json files with their folder ( say the latest version folder for bolts) in this specs repository. 3) remove the source \'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git\' in the podfile 4) pod update This will take significantly less time as this requires fetching and downloading just the pods you need instead of whole cocoapods repository. \nIn My case it reduced the pod update time from 15-20 mins on average to 3-4 mins at most.  Pod Installation StepsFirst Open Terminal:if already installed pod in your system then follow the below stepsI had the same problem, I then realized that I was still running Network Conditioner on "Very Bad Network". Turning that off solved the issue.Hope that helps someone.I fixed this issue like that:Reference: http://blog.cocoapods.org/Repairing-Our-Broken-Specs-Repository/Sometimes happen to me too and I simply:Even I was thinking the same. If you open Activity Monitor you can see that it is downloading something at there on the name of GIT.I found this tip useful.https://stackoverflow.com/a/21916507/563735
