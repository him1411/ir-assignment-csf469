I\'m getting this warning in my project gradle file:Warning:(16, 5) \'buildTypes\' cannot be applied to \'(groovy.lang.Closure< com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.BuildType>)\'My buildTypes section is:I\'m currently using Android Studio 1.1.0, compileSdkVersion 22, buildToolsVersion 22.0.0, and targetSdkVersion 22. I tried backing down to 21 but was still getting the warning.What causes this warning & how is it fixed?For me the problem was not solved by applying the above solution. Instead I had to go to the settings within Android Studio and select "Use gradle wrapper":In Android Studio select:\nFile\\Settings\\Build, Execution, Deployment\\Build tools\\Gradle (Mac Users: Android Studio\\Preferences...\\Build, Execution, Deployment\\Build tools\\Gradle )Mark: Use default gradle wrapper (default)This removed all \'cannot be applied to \'(groovy.lang.Closure\') warnings in the build files.I had the same issue. Moving the buildTypes as the last entry in the android section worked for me.1 Cut and Paste the "buildTypes" at the same position in "android" section 2 Re Sync ProjectTo solve this issue, in your Android Studio go to File -> Settings.\nIn settings choose Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle\nand select "Use default gradle wrapper (recommended)" option.After rebuild your build.gradle will be totally fine.If none of the above options work, then do the FollowingI managed to solve my issue by simply doing this:\nClick "File" then select "Invalidate Caches/ RestartThe easiest way to fix this Gradle issues is recreating the project to let Android Studio reconfigure Gradle.Simply select "Open an existing Android Studio project" and pick your project folder.More details here.this worked for me:The problem presents when you import a project into your environment and the Gradle plugin is installed in a different location than what it was in the original. You just need to point out where your Gradle installation is.Moving buildTypes or defaultConfig or whatever between each other is not a complete solutionThe issue at hand is that your Android Studio settings that you probably imported at upgrade, was still pointing to gradle-2.4 or some other versions than Android Studio 1.5 expects.To solve this problem, you should open up Settings and go to Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle and change your local gradle distribution\'s home path or select the default gradle wrapper.Apply and re-sync your project.I had the same problem. I started a new project and it worked, so I just copied the build.gradle file. In my case the only difference was the lack of the compileOptions section. I removed it from my project, synced gradle, re-inserted the compileOptions section and then synced gradle again.In your Android Studio go to File -> Settings. Next choose Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle and select "Use default gradle wrapper (recommended)".Rebuild project.In my case my buildTypes section was above my productFlavors section. Interchanging their positions got rid of the warning:BEFORE:AFTER:I am using Android Studio 2.1.2 with the following config at the top of my android section:I used to have this warning, after I updated Android Studio. When I went to Settings>>Build Tools>>Gradle I found Local Gradle path was invalid, since gradle version was updated as well from 2.6 to 2.8.Fixed the new path and re-sync gradle removed the warning.Another way is to use gradlewrapper.Changing distributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.1-bin.zip to gradle-2.1-all.zip in gradle-wrapper.properties solved problem for me.EDIT: \nThis how i finally solved this problem...Navigate in Android Studio to:File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | GradleEnsure that this is unchecked, despite that it is recommended to keep ...Use Default Gradle Wrapper (recommended)and that this one is checked ...Use local gradle distributionand that Gradle Home is set to this, with possibly a later gradle-n.n ...C:/Program Files/Android/Android Studio1/gradle/gradle-2.4You may have to restart Android Studio, rebuild the project, etc but the problem is solved.End of EDIT.I am posting this to advise anyone else new to this problem to ignore it. The project runs perfectly regardless. This is quite simply a bug in the build system, hopefully to be fixed soon. I posted a comment and voted here where it is again an active topic ...https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?can=2&start=0&num=100&q=&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars&groupby=&sort=&id=76719After trying, unsuccessfully, the suggestions in the following three threads, i re-made the entire project from scratch. I started a new Android Studio project, copied all of the original libs and main files into it ignoring any files which are generated by the build system and rebuilt the project. Everything was fine except all those "cannot be applied to \'(groovy.lang.Closure)\'" warnings re-appeared with a vengence. Then i went thru these suggestions again just to be certain that i had not overlooked something.1\nbuildTypes cannot be applied to groovy.lang.Closure\ngo to the settings within Android Studio and select "Use gradle wrapper":\nIn Android Studio select: File\\Settings\\Build, Execution, Deployment\\Build tools\\Gradle\nMark: Use default gradle wrapper (default)\nThis removed all \'cannot be applied to \'(groovy.lang.Closure\') warnings in the build files.2\n'dependencies' cannot be applied to '(groovy.lang.Closure)'\nOpen and edit file: yourproject/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.propertie. Edit content as below image then save.\nDelete this folder: yourproject/.gradle.\nClick Sync project with gradle files, then you are good to go.3\nhttps://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/issues/870My configuration is:\nAndroid Studio 1.3,  compileSdk Version 22, buildTools Version "22.0.1"delete gradle folder under the app folder and resync projectAll I had to do to removeFromand the warning went away. Final look was like thisChanging the buildToolsVersion fromtoworked for me.
