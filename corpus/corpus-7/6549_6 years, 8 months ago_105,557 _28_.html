I\'ve seen a lot of posts about stack trace and exceptions in Python. But haven\'t found what I need.I have a chunk of Python 2.7 code that may raise an exception. I would like to catch it and assign to a string its full description and the stack trace that caused the error (simply all we use to see on the console). I need this string to print it to a text box in the GUI.Something like this:The problem is: what is the function complete_exception_description?See the traceback module, specifically the format_exc() function. Here.You use sys.exc_info() to collect the information and the functions in the traceback module to format it.\nHere are some examples for formatting it.The whole exception string is at:To create a decently complicated stacktrace to demonstrate that we get the full stacktrace:A best practice is to have a logger set up for your module. It will know the name of the module and be able to change levels (among other attributes, such as handlers)And we can use this logger to get the error:Which logs:And so we get the same output as when we have an error:If you really just want the string, use the traceback.format_exc function instead, demonstrating logging the string here:Which logs:You might also consider using the built-in Python module, cgitb, to get some really good, nicely formatted exception information including local variable values, source code context, function parameters etc..For instance for this code...we get this exception output...With Python 3, the following code will format an Exception object exactly as would be obtained using traceback.format_exc():The advantage being that only the Exception object is needed (thanks to the recorded __traceback__ attribute), and can therefore be more easily passed as an argument to another function for further processing.For those using Python-3Using traceback module and exception.__traceback__ one can extract the stack-trace as follows:A simple demonstration:We get the following output when we call bar():my 2-cents:I defined following helper class:Which I can later use like this:And later can consume it like this:(Background: I was frustraded because of using Promises together with Exceptions, which unfortunately passes exceptions raised in one place to a on_rejected handler in another place, and thus it is difficult to get the traceback from original location)
