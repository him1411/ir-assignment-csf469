I have the following HTML <select> element:Using a JavaScript function with the leaveCode number as a parameter, how do I select the appropriate option in the list?If you are using jQuery you can also do thisThis will select the option with the value of 14I compared the different methods:Comparison of the different ways on how to set a value of a select with JS or jQuerycode:Output on a select with  ~4000 elements:1 ms58 ms612 msWith Firefox 10. Note: The only reason I did this test, was because jQuery performed super poorly on our list with ~2000 entries (they had longer texts between the options).\nWe had roughly 2 s delay after a val()Note as well: I am setting value depending on the real value, not the text valueNot answering the question, but you can also select by index, where i is the index of the item you wish to select:You can also loop through the items to select by display value with a loop:That should set the selection to "Annual Leave"The easiest way if you need to:\n1) Click a button which defines select option\n2) Go to another page, where select option is\n3) Have that option value selected on another page1) your button links (say, on home page)(where contact.php is your page with select options. Note the page url has ?option=1 or 2)2) put this code on your second page (my case contact.php) 3) make the option value selected, depending on the button clicked.. and so on.\nSo this is an easy way of passing the value to another page (with select option list) through GET in url. No forms, no IDs.. just 3 steps and it works perfect.I tried the above JavaScript/jQuery-based solutions, such as: andin an AngularJS app, where there was a required <select> element.None of them works, because the AngularJS form validation is not fired. Although the right option was selected (and is displayed in the form), the input remained invalid (ng-pristine and ng-invalid classes still present).To force the AngularJS validation, call jQuery change() after selecting an option:andThere are different ways to Select values of drop down using Javascript.You most likely want this:ORWhy not add a variable for the element\'s Id and make it a reusable function?Suppose your form is named form1:Should be something along these lines:Using Jquery:If using PHP you could try something like this:I\'m afraid I\'m unable to test this at the moment, but in the past, I believe I had to give each option tag an ID, and then I did something like:If that doesn\'t work, maybe it\'ll get you closer to a solution :P
