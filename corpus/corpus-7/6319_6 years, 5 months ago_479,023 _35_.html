How do you test an element for existence without the use of the getElementById method? I have setup a live demo for reference. I will also print the code on here as well:Basically what the above code demonstrates is an element being stored into a variable and then removed from dom. Even though the element has been removed from the dom, the variable retains the element as it was when first declared. In other words, it is not a live reference to the element itself, but rather a replica. As a result, checking the variable\'s value (the element) for existence will provide an unexpected result.The isNull function is my attempt to check for an elements existence from a variable, and it works, but I would like to know if there is an easier way to accomplish the same result.PS: I\'m also interested in why JavaScript variables behave like this if anyone knows of some good articles related to the subject.It seems some people are landing here, and simply want to know if an element exists (a little bit different to the original question).That\'s as simple as using any of the browser\'s selecting method, and checking it for a truthy value (generally).For example, if my element had an id of "find-me", I could simply use...This is spec\'d to either return a reference to the element or null. If you must have a Boolean value, simply toss a !! before the method call.In addition, you can use some of the many other methods that exist for finding elements, such as (all living off document):Some of these methods return a NodeList, so be sure to check its length property, because a NodeList is an object, and therefore truthy.For actually determining if an element exists as part of the visible DOM (like the question originally asked), Csuwldcat provides a better solution than rolling your own (as this answer used to contain). That is, to use the contains() method on DOM elements.You could use it like so...Why would you not use getElementById() if it\'s available?  Also, here\'s an easy way to do it with jQuery: And if you can\'t use 3rd-party libraries, just stick to base JavaScript:  Using the Node.contains DOM API, you can check for the presence of any element in the page (currently in the DOM) quite easily:CROSS-BROWSER NOTE: the document object in IE does not have a contains() method - to ensure cross-browser compatibility, use document.body.contains() insteadI simply do:Works for me and had no issues with it yet....Easiest solution is to check the baseURI property, which is set only when the element is inserted in the DOM, and reverts to an empty string when it is removed.Could you just check to see if the parentNode property is null?i.e. From Mozilla Developer NetworkThis function checks to see if an element is in the page\'s body. As contains is inclusive and determining if the body contains itself isn\'t the intention of isInPage this case explicitly returns false.node is the node we want to check for in the .csuwldcat\'s solution seems to be the best of the bunch, but a slight modification is needed to make it work correctly with an element that\'s in a different document than the javascript is running in, such as an iframe:YOUR_ELEMENT.ownerDocument.body.contains(YOUR_ELEMENT);Note the use of the element\'s ownerDocument property, as opposed to just plain ol\' document (which may or may not refer to the element\'s owner document).torazaburo posted an even simpler method that also works with non-local elements, but unfortunately, it uses the baseURI property, which is not uniformly implemented across browsers at this time (I could only get it to work in the webkit-based ones). I couldn\'t find any other element or node properties that could be used in a similar fashion, so I think for the time being the above solution is as good as it gets.jQuery solution:This worked for me using jQuery and did not require $(\'#elementId\')[0] to be used. I liked this approachAlsoSimple solution with jQueryYou can also use jQuery.contains, which checks if an element is a descendant of another element. I passed in document as the parent element to search because any elements that exist on the page DOM are a descendant of document.
