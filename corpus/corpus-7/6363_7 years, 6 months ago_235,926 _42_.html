How can I stage and commit all files, including newly added files, using a single command?Does count as a "single command"?This command will add and commit all the modified files, but not newly created files.From man git-commit:One-liner to stage ALL files (modified, deleted, and new) and commit with comment:http://git-scm.com/docs/git-add\nhttp://git-scm.com/docs/git-commitI use this function:In my zsh config file, so i can just do:To automatically stage and commit all files.This command will add and commit all the modified files, but not newly created files.From manual of git-commit:here is link of git documentationCommitting in git can be a multiple step process or one step depending on the situation. This situation is where you have multiple file updated and wants to\ncommit:You have to add all the modified files before you commit anything.orAfter that you can use commit all the added files with this you have to add the message for this commit.If you just want a "quick and dirty" way to stash changes on the current branch, you can use the following alias:After running that command, you can just type git temp to have git automatically commit all your changes to the current branch as a commit named "Temp". Then, you can use git reset HEAD~ later to "uncommit" the changes so you can continue working on them, or git commit --amend to add more changes to the commit and/or give it a proper name.I have in my config two aliases:if I am too lazy I just commit all changes withand just to do a quick commitcoa stands for "commit all"Great answers, but if you look for a singe line do all, you can concatenate, alias and enjoy the convenience: git add * && git commit -am  "<commit message>"It is a single line but two commands, and as mentioned you can alias these commands: alias git-aac="git add * && git commit -am " (the space at the end is important) because you are going to parameterize the new short hand command.From this moment on, you will be using this alias: git-acc "<commit message>" You basically say: git, add for me all untracked files and commit them with this given commit message.Hope you use Linux, hope this helps.Not sure why these answers all dance around what I believe to be the right solution but for what it\'s worth here is what I use,git config --global alias.coa \'!git add -A && git commit -m\'git coa "A bunch of horrible changes"coa (short for commit all) can be replaced with anything your heart desiresYou need not use git add at all. You can add files using git commit itself\nFor example:It worked for meYou can write a small script (look at Ian Clelland\'s answer) called git-commitall which uses several git commands to perform what you want to do.\nPlace this script in your anywhere in your $PATH. You can call it by git commitall ... very handy!Found here (question and all answers unfortunately deleted, only visible with high reputation)
