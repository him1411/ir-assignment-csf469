Since I use Maven I have been able to build and install in my local repository projects that have incomplete Javadoc tags (for example, a missing parameter). However, since I migrated to Java 8 (1.8.0-ea-b90) Maven is absolutely strict about missing documentation tags and show me lots of Javadoc errors related to Javadoc problems when I try to build or install a project where the Javadoc is not "perfect". Some of the projects I am trying to compile and install in my local repository are third party projects from which I do not have control. So the workaround of just fixing all the Javadocs in all these projects does not seem to be feasable in my scenario.This is a small part of the output I see when I execute mvn clean package install in my project:The Javadoc Maven plugin is configured like this in my POM:As I said before, everything is working fine if I go back to Java 7. \nMaybe is this a bug related to Maven running in Java 8?\nHow could I make it work (i.e., being able to build the Javadoc of the project and install its code in my local repository) with Java 8?\nI have tested with both Maven 3.0.3 and 3.0.5 in OSX.UPDATE:If I change my Javadoc plugin configuration with <failOnError>false</failOnError> (thanks Martin):Then the project is installed in my local repository. However, the Javadoc JAR is still not generated.A fragment of the output I see in the console with this new configuration is:[ERROR] MavenReportException: Error while creating archive:  Exit\n  code: 1 - /Users/....java:18: warning: no @param  ...

If for some reason that is not possible (ie: auto generated source code) then you can disable this check.DocLint is a new feature in Java 8, which is summarized as:Provide a means to detect errors in Javadoc comments early in the\n  development cycle and in a way that is easily linked back to the\n  source code.This is enabled by default, and will run a whole lot of checks before generating Javadocs. You need to turn this off for Java 8 as specified in this thread. You\'ll have to add this to your maven configuration:The easiest approach to get things working with both java 8 and java 7 is to use a profile in the build:Here is the most concise way I am aware of to ignore doclint warnings regardless of java version used. There is no need to duplicate plugin configuration in multiple profiles with slight modifications.Tested on oracle/open jdk 6, 7 and 8.Overriding maven-javadoc-plugin configuration only, does not fix the problem with mvn site (used e.g during the release stage). Here\'s what I had to do:Add into the global properties section in the pom file:The common solution provided here in the other answers (adding that property in the plugins section) did not work for some reason. Only by setting it globally I could build the javadoc jar successfully.I don\'t think just turning off DocLint is a good solution, at least not long term. It is good that Javadoc has become a bit more strict so the right way to fix the build problem is to fix the underlying problem. Yes, you\'ll ultimately need to fix those source code files.Here are the things to look out for that you could previously get away with:You\'ll simply have to fix your source code files and keep building your Javadoc until it can build without a failure. Cumbersome yes, but personally I like when I have brought my projects up to DocLint level because it means I can be more confident that the Javadoc I produce is actually what I intend.There\'s of course the problem if you are generating Javadoc on some source code you\'ve not produced yourself, for example because it comes from some code generator, e.g. wsimport. Strange that Oracle didn\'t prepare their own tools for JDK8 compliance before actually releasing JDK8. It seems it won\'t be fixed until Java 9. Only in this particular case I suggest to turn off DocLint as documented elsewhere on this page.Just add that to your POM and you\'re good to go.This is basically @ankon\'s answer plus @zapp\'s answer.You could try setting the failOnError property (see plugin documentation) to false:As you can see from the docs, the default value is true.Since it depends on the version of your JRE which is used to run the maven command you propably dont want to disable DocLint per default in your pom.xmlHence, from command line you can use the switch -Dadditionalparam=-Xdoclint:none.Example: mvn clean install -Dadditionalparam=-Xdoclint:noneI\'m not sure if this is going to help, but even i faced the exact same problem very recently with oozie-4.2.0 version.  After reading through the above answers i have just added the maven option through command line and it worked for me.  So, just sharing here.I\'m using java 1.8.0_77, haven\'t tried with java 1.7  bin/mkdistro.sh -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.opts=\'-Xdoclint:-html\'
