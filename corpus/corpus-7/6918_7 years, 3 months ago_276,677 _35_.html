Here is the HTML:And here is the CSS:Upon inspection with the Chrome developer tools, the inner div is getting a height of 0px.How can I force it to be 100% of the height of the parent div?For #outer height to be based on its content, and have #inner base its height on that, make both elements absolutely positioned.More details can be found in the spec for the css  height property, but essentially, #inner must ignore #outer height if #outer\'s height is auto, unless #outer is positioned absolutely. Then #inner height will be 0, unless #inner itself is positioned absolutely.However... By positioning #inner absolutely, a float setting will be ignored, so you will need to choose a width for #inner explicitly, and add padding in #outer to fake the text wrapping I suspect you want. For example, below, the padding of #outer is the width of #inner +3. Conveniently (as the whole point was to get #inner height to 100%) there\'s no need to wrap text beneath #inner, so this will look just like #inner is floated.I deleted my previous answer, as it was based on too many wrong assumptions about your goal.For the parent:You should add some prefixes http://css-tricks.com/using-flexbox/Edit:\nOnly drawback is IE as usual, IE9 does not support flex.\nhttp://caniuse.com/flexboxEdit 2:\nAs @toddsby noted, align items is for parent, and its default value actually is stretch. If you want a different value for child, there is align-self property.Actually, as long as the parent element is positioned, you can set the child\'s height to 100%. Namely, in case you don\'t want the parent to be absolutely positioned. Let me explain further:As long as you don\'t need to support versions of Internet Explorer earlier than IE8, you can use display: table-cell to accomplish this:HTML:CSS:This will force each element with the .inner class to occupy the full height of its parent element.I made an example resolving your problem.You have to make a wrapper, float it, then position absolute your div and give to it 100% height. HTMLCSS:Explanation: The .right div is absolutely positioned. That means that its width and height, and top and left positiones will be calculed based on the first parent div absolutely or relative positioned ONLY if width or height properties are explicitly declared in CSS; if they aren\'t explicty declared, those properties will be calculed based on the parent container (.right-wrapper).So, the 100% height of the DIV will be calculed based on .container final height, and the final position of .right position will be calculed based on the parent container. Here it is a simpler way to achieve that: Thanks to @Itay in Floated div, 100% heightIf you\'re prepared to use a little jQuery, the answer is simple!This works well for floating a single element to a side with 100% height of it\'s parent while other floated elements which would normally wrap around are kept to one side.Hope this helps fellow jQuery fans.This helped me.Change right: and left: to set preferable #inner width.A similar case when you need several child elements have the same height can be solved with flexbox:https://css-tricks.com/using-flexbox/Set display: flex; for parent and flex: 1; for child elements, they all will have the same height.try show more options in: \nHow do you keep parents of floated elements from collapsing?
