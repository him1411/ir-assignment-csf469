I wanted to rename one of my repositories on GitHub, but I got scared when a big red warning said:Does anyone have step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish #1 and #2 manually? Or what do I have to do locally?If you are the only person working on the project, it\'s not a big problem, because you only have to do #2.Let\'s say your username is someuser and your project is called someproject.Then your project\'s URL will be1If you rename your project, it will change the someproject part of the URL, e.g.(see footnote if your URL does not look like this).Your working copy of git uses this URL when you do a push or pull.So after you rename your project, you will have to tell your working copy the new URL.You can do that in two steps:Firstly, cd to your local git directory, and find out what remote name(s) refer to that URLThen, set the new URLor in older versions of git, you might need(origin is the most common remote name, but it might be called something else.)But if there\'s lots of people who are working on your project, they will all need to do the above steps, and maybe you don\'t even know how to contact them all to tell them.  That\'s what #1 is about.Further reading:Footnotes:1 The exact format of your URL depends on which protocol you are using, e.g.Note that since May 2013 ("Repository redirects are here!"), you can rename your GitHub repo without breaking any links:We\'re happy to announce that starting today, we\'ll automatically redirect all requests for previous repository locations to their new home in these circumstances. There\'s nothing special you have to do. Just rename away and we\'ll take care of the rest.As a special bonus, we\'ll also be servicing all Git clone, fetch, and push requests from previous repository locations.That means you don\'t even have to git remote set-url (change the url of your remote GitHub repo) on your local cloned repo!\nAlthough Gabriel notes in the comments that the official GitHub help page strongly recommends that you do so:to reduce confusion, we strongly recommend updating any existing local clones to point to the new repository URL. You can do this by using git remote on the command line:Beware though:GitHub Pages sites are not automatically redirected when their repositories are renamed at this time.\n  Renaming a Pages repository will continue to break any existing links to content hosted on the github.io domain or custom domains.Plus, the user still owns the namespace: if he/she creates a new repo using the old name of the renamed repo, that redirection (for said renamed repo) will stop working.I rename my own just by simply :After this step, GitHub will make sure that, your online repository matches your local folder name.\nAt this step your problem is solved, unless you also want to rename your local folder. Then do it manually and just use the Github client for windows to refind again your repository into your hard drive, and Github will match it again.\nThat\'s all!\nVery simple.This answer is now obsolete! GitHub will forward to new locations now.\nSee this answer for details.The reason this warning is there is because #1 can\'t be made manually.If you are the only person working on and linking to the repository, then you are fine with changing the remote in your local repo and in your webpages.However, the reason to have a public repository on github in the first place is that you can have others cloning your repository and linking to your github project page.The old url github.com/<username>/<repository> is owned by github.\nWhen they don\'t setup any redirects to the new url, nobody can.\nSo things will break for everybody except the persons you are telling.How big of a problem that is, is up to you though.\nIf you have an official project page on a different server,\nthen the github url might not be much of a problem.\nIf you advertised your project with the github url in mailing lists and directories,\nthen you probably should not change the repo name.An alternative to changing the repo name is to create a new repository and leave notes in the old one (also as commits in the repo) about how to reach your new repo.If you wan\'t your new repo to be listed as a fork of your old repo you need to create a new github account.\nYou can add your other account as a collaborator for both repositories.It is worth noting that if you fork a GitHub project and then rename the newly spawned copy, the new name appears in the members network graph of the parent project.  The complementary relationship is preserved as well.  This should address any reservations associated with the first point in the original question related to redirects, i.e. you can still get here from there, so to speak.  I, too, was hesitant because of the irrevocability implied by the warning, so hopefully this will save others that delay.This solution is for those users who use GitHub desktop.Rename your repository from setting on GitHub.comNow from your desktop click on sync.Done.open this url (https://github.com/) from your browserGo to repositories at the Right end of the pageOpen the link of repository that you want to renameclick Settings (you will find in the Navigation bar)At the top you will find a box Called (Repository name) where you write the new namePress Rename 1) Open your project url: https://github.com/someuser/project-name \n2) in the top, aside of the project name, click EDIT
