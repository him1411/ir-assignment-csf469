I have an array A which is constantly being updated. Lets say A = [1,2,3,4,5]. I need to make an exact duplicate copy of A and call it B. If A were to change to [6,7,8,9,10], B should still be [1,2,3,4,5]. What is the best way to do this? I tried a for loop like:but that doesn\'t seem to work correctly. Please don\'t use advanced terms like deep copy etc because I do not know what that means.You can try using System.arraycopy()you can useas well.If you want to make a copy of:This is the way to go:Arrays.copyOf may be faster than a.clone() on small arrays. Both copy elements equally fast but clone() returns Object so the compiler has to insert an implicit cast to int[]. You can see it in the bytecode, something like this:I have a feeling that all of these "better ways to copy an array" are not really going to solve your problem.You sayI tried a for loop like [...] but that doesn\'t seem to be working correctly?Looking at that loop, there\'s no obvious reason for it not to work ... unless:In either case, alternative ways of doing the copying won\'t solve the underlying problem.The fix for the first scenario is obvious.  For the second scenario you will have to figure out some way of synchronizing the threads.  Atomic array classes don\'t help because they have no atomic copy constructors or clone methods, but synchronizing using a primitive mutex will do the trick.(There are hints in your question that lead me to think that this is indeed thread related; e.g. your statement that a is constantly changing.)Nice explanation from http://www.journaldev.com/753/how-to-copy-arrays-in-javaJava Array Copy MethodsObject.clone(): Object class provides clone() method and since array\n  in java is also an Object, you can use this method to achieve full\n  array copy. This method will not suit you if you want partial copy of\n  the array.System.arraycopy(): System class arraycopy() is the best way to do\n  partial copy of an array. It provides you an easy way to specify the\n  total number of elements to copy and the source and destination array\n  index positions. For example System.arraycopy(source, 3, destination,\n  2, 5) will copy 5 elements from source to destination, beginning from\n  3rd index of source to 2nd index of destination.Arrays.copyOf(): If you want to copy first few elements of an array or\n  full copy of array, you can use this method. Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s not\n  versatile like System.arraycopy() but it\xe2\x80\x99s also not confusing and easy\n  to use.Arrays.copyOfRange(): If you want few elements of an array to be\n  copied, where starting index is not 0, you can use this method to copy\n  partial array.All solution that call length from array, add your code redundant null checkersconsider example:I recommend you not inventing the wheel and use utility class where all necessary checks have already performed. Consider ArrayUtils from apache commons. You code become shorter:Apache commons you can find thereYou can also use Arrays.copyOfRange.Example:This method is similar to Arrays.copyOf, but it\'s more flexible. Both of them use System.arraycopy under the hood. See:You can try using Arrays.copyOf() in JavaFor a null-safe copy of an array, you can also use an optional with the Object.clone() method provided in this answer.If you must work with raw arrays and not ArrayList then Arrays has what you need. If you look at the source code, these are the absolutely best ways to get a copy of an array. They do have a good bit of defensive programming because the System.arraycopy() method throws lots of unchecked exceptions if you feed it illogical parameters.You can use either Arrays.copyOf() which will copy from the first to Nth element to the new shorter array.Copies the specified array, truncating or padding with nulls (if\n  necessary) so the copy has the specified length. For all indices that\n  are valid in both the original array and the copy, the two arrays will\n  contain identical values. For any indices that are valid in the copy\n  but not the original, the copy will contain null. Such indices will\n  exist if and only if the specified length is greater than that of the\n  original array. The resulting array is of exactly the same class as\n  the original array.or Arrays.copyOfRange() will also do the trick:Copies the specified range of the specified array into a new array.\n  The initial index of the range (from) must lie between zero and\n  original.length, inclusive. The value at original[from] is placed into\n  the initial element of the copy (unless from == original.length or\n  from == to). Values from subsequent elements in the original array are\n  placed into subsequent elements in the copy. The final index of the\n  range (to), which must be greater than or equal to from, may be\n  greater than original.length, in which case null is placed in all\n  elements of the copy whose index is greater than or equal to\n  original.length - from. The length of the returned array will be to -\n  from. The resulting array is of exactly the same class as the original\n  array.As you can see, both of these are just wrapper functions over System.arraycopy with defensive logic that what you are trying to do is valid.System.arraycopy is the absolute fastest way to copy arrays.
