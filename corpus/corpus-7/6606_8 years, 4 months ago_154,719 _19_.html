What is the best way to detect if a jQuery-selector returns an empty object.\nIf you do:you get [object Object], so the way I do it now is:which will write "undefined", and so you can do a check for that. But it seems very bad. What other way is there?My favourite is to extend jQuery with this tiny convenience:Used like:More explicit than using length.The selector returns an array of jQuery objects. If no matching elements are found, it returns an empty array. You can check the .length of the collection returned by the selector or check whether the first array element is \'undefined\'.You can use any the following examples inside an IF statement and they all produce the same result. True, if the selector found a matching element, false otherwise.I like to do something like this:So then you can do something like this:http://jsfiddle.net/vhbSG/I like to use presence, inspired from Ruby on Rails:Your example becomes:I find it superior to the proposed $.fn.exists because you can still use boolean operators or if, but the truthy result is more useful. Another example:My preference, and I have no idea why this isn\'t already in jQuery:Used like this:Or, as it looks in CoffeeScript:This is in the JQuery documentation:http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-test-whether-an-element-exists/
