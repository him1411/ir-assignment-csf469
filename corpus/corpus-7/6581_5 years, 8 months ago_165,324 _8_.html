I would like to know how to check whether a string starts with "hello" in Python.In Bash I usually do:How do I achieve the same in Python?RanRag has already answered it for your specific question.However, more generally, what you are doing withis a regex match. To do the same in Python, you would do:Obviously, in this case, somestring.startswith(\'hello\') is better.Can also be done this way..
