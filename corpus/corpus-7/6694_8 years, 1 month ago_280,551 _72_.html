I\'m looking to accept digits and the decimal point, but no sign.  I\'ve looked at samples using the NumericUpDown control for WinForms, and this sample of a NumericUpDown custom control from Microsoft. But so far it seems like NumericUpDown (supported by WPF or not) is not going to provide the functionality that I want. The way my app is designed, nobody in their right mind is going to want to mess with the arrows. They don\'t make any practical sense, in the context of my app.  So I\'m looking for a simple way to make a standard WPF TextBox accept only the characters that I want. Is this possible? Is it practical?Add a preview text input event. Like so: <TextBox PreviewTextInput="PreviewTextInput" />.Then inside that set the e.Handled if the text isn\'t allowed. e.Handled = !IsTextAllowed(e.Text);I use a simple regex in IsTextAllowed method to see if I should allow what they\'ve typed. In my case I only want to allow numbers, dots and dashes.If you want to prevent pasting of incorrect data hook up the DataObject.Pasting event DataObject.Pasting="TextBoxPasting" as shown here (code excerpted):The Event handler is preview text input. Here regular expression matches the text input only if it is not a number, then it is not made to entry textbox. If you want only alphabets then replace the regular expression as [^a-zA-Z].Used some of what was already here and put my own twist on it using a behavior so I don\'t have to propogate this code throughout a ton of Views...Here is the relevant view code.This is an improved solution of WilPs answer. \nMy improvements are:Usage is pretty straightforward:Add in a VALIDATION RULE that when the text changes checks to determine if the data is numeric, and if it is, allows processing to continue, and if it is not, prompts the user that only numeric data is accepted in that field.Read more here: \nhttp://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/wpfvalidation.aspxThe Extented WPF Toolkit has one: NumericUpDown\nCould also simply implement a validation rule and apply it to the TextBox:With the implementation of the rule as follow (using the same Regex as proposed in other answers):I allowed numpad numbers and backspace:Hope it helps.I will assume that: your TextBox for which you want to allow numeric input only has its Text property initially set to some valid number value (for example 2.7172).your Textbox is a child of your main windowyour main window is of class Window1your TextBox name is numericTBBasic idea:Add: private string previousText; to your main window class (Window1)Add: previousText = numericTB.Text; to your main window constructorcreate handler for numericTB.TextChanged event to be something like thisThis will keep setting previousText to numericTB.Text as long as it is valid, and set numericTB.Text to its last valid value if user writes something that you don\'t like. Of course this is just basic idea and it is just "idiot resistant", not "idiot proof". It doesn\'t handle case in which user messes with spaces, for example. So here is complete solution which I think is "idiot proof", and if I\'m wrong please tell me:content of your Window1.xaml file:content of your Window.xaml.cs file:Ant that\'s it. If you have many TextBoxes than I recommend creating CustomControl that inherits from TextBox, so you can wrap previousText and numericTB_TextChanged up in a separate file.Happy coding.This is the only code needed:This only allows numbers to be inputted into the text box.To allow a decimal point or minus sign, you can change the regular expression to [^0-9.-]+.If you do not want to write a lot of code to do a basic function (idk why people make long methods) when you can just do this:Add namespace:In Xaml set a TextChanged property:In WPF under txt1_TextChanged method, add Regex.ReplaceWe can do validation on text box changed event. The following implementation prevents keypress input other than numeric and one decimal point.in preview keydown event of textbox.Here is very simple and easy way to do this using MVVM.Bind your textBox with int property in View Model and this will work like gem ...even it will show validation when non-integer is entered in textbox.\nXAML code:View Model code : Hope this helps!This is an old question, but I was working with an unbound box for a simple project I was working on, so I couldn\'t use the standard binding approach. Consequently I created a simple hack that others might find quite handy by simply extending the existing TextBox control:Obviously, for a floating type, you would want to parse it as a float and so on. Principles apply.Then in the XAML file you need to include the relevant namespace:After that you can use it as a regular control:This is an old question, but after using some of the solutions here for some time, I developed my own that works well for my MVVM setup.  Note that it\'s not as dynamic as some of the other ones in a sense of still allowing users to enter erroneous characters, but it blocks them from pressing the button and thus doing anything.  This goes well with my theme of graying out buttons when actions cannot be performed.I have a TextBox that a user must enter a number of document pages to be printed:...with this binding property:I also have a button:...with this command binding:And then there\'s the method of SetNumberOfPages(), but it\'s unimportant for this topic.  Some solutions are better than others in certain situations, so I figured I\'d share this, so that someone who\'s in a similar situation to mine may use it.  It works well in my case because I don\'t have to add any code into the View\'s code-behind file and it allows me to control behavior using the Command property.when checking number value you can use the VisualBasic.IsNumeric functionIn the Wpf application, you can handle this by handling TextChanged event:Here is a library for numeric input in WPFIt has properties like NumberStyles and RegexPatternfor validation.Subclasses WPF TextBoxIn Windows Forms it was easy, you can add an event for KeyPress and everything works easily. However, in WPF that event isn\'t there. But there is a much easier way for it. WPF TextBox has TextChanged event which is general for everything, it includes pasting, typing and whatever that can come up to your mind.So you can do something like this:XAML:CODE BEHIND:This also accepts . , if you don\'t want it, just remove it from the regex statement to be @[^\\d].Note: This event can be used on many TextBox\'es as it uses the sender object\'s Text. You only write the event once and can use it for multiple TextBox\'es.This is what I would use to get a wpf textbox that accept digits and the decimal point:Put the code in a new class file, addat the top of the file and build the solution. The numericTextBox control will then appear at the top of the toolbox.
