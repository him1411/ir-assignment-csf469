I recently upgraded from Eclipse to Android Studio and I\'m not really liking the experience. I\'m comparing them both on a Windows 7 64 bit ultimate with 16GB of ram and Intel i7 4770 running NVidia Geforce 780 with the latest NVidia drivers if it matters and I\'m running the latest JDK and the latest Android Studio.The Android Studio is very slow in building the project which I can live with but it\'s also extremely resource intensive and sometimes slows down the PC to a crawl. Whenever I\'m building or running anything in AS, my PC seems to become extremely sluggish. It also causes flickering of screen and occasionally blanking my second monitor if I click on "Gradle build running" spinner which I find very odd. The RAM usage also shoots up to ~3GB which I find excessive for doing nothing (this is when it\'s idle after a few builds).In addition, the panels at the bottom of AS keep jumping around which is a horrible user experience (moves from Android to Messages to Version Control or anything else on an ad-hoc basis depending on what\'s happening which is very, very annoying).What I would like to know is basically:1) How do I make Android Studio run better? I may be doing something wrong or missing some updates that I\'m not aware of and I\'m sure others have also noticed these behaviors and have found some solutions to it.2) How do I "pin" the bottom panels so that they don\'t jump around and instead, let me, the user, navigate to them when I wish to instead of automatically switching them?Many thanks and my apologies again if it\'s not the correct place for these questions.Edit 1\nSome more comments:to sum it up1) in AndroidStudio\'s settings > compile enable checkbox named Compile    independent modules in parallel.2) Under Help> Edit Custom Vmoptions I have: p.s. Some people say Note, instead of    VM options, it\'s better to combine can be overriden by combining those lines into one line single command in gradle.properties, like this :org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xms1024m -Xmx4096m ......3) I have an old dual core with 4GB ram, running ubuntu. Qs command line option I have only --offline (which specifies that the build should operate without accessing network resources). I also enabled the remaining checkboxes and now it\'s running ok:Make project automaticallyUse in-process building Configure on demandCheck the AndroidStudio\'s settings, under compile that the checkbox Compile independent modules in parallel is enabled.Under Vmoptions I haveI have an old dual core with 4GB ram, running ubuntu. Qs commandline option I have only --offline , which specifies that the build should operate without accessing network resources. I enabled also the remaining checkboxes:Configure on demandand it is running okEditIt is possible to provide additional options through studio.vmoptions located at (just replace X.X with version):Windows: go to %USERPROFILE%\\.AndroidStudioX.X\\studio.exe.vmoptions   (or studio64.exe.vmoptions)Mac: ~/Library/Preferences/.AndroidStudioX.X/studio.vmoptionsLinux: ~/.AndroidStudioX.X/studio.vmoptions (and/or studio64.vmoptions)Increasing the value of -Xmx should help a lot. E.gwill assign 4G as max heap, with initial value of 1GEdit:On windows the defaults are stored into  C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\bin\\*.vmoptions. The IDE allows you to tweak those values through Help->Edit Custom VM options (thanls to @Code-Read for pointing it out)Tips to make android studio fast:Enable Offline Work:Improve Gradle Performancegradle can be optimized too. The easy way is to modify the settings in global gradle.properties (create it if not exists in the following folders: Windows - C:\\users\\your_name\\.gradle\\; Linux- /home/<username>/.gradle/; Mac- /Users/<username>/.gradle/; ) and in that file, add these two lines:For More: http://www.viralandroid.com/2015/08/how-to-make-android-studio-fast.htmlI detected another reason - Thumbs.db, which affected performance badly.Go to File > Settings > Editor > File Types and in field Ignore files and folders add this:  Thumbs.db;Now, Android Studio runs like a charm.I had the same problem, even with simple apps (on 01/2/2016, latest Android Studio 1.5, and latest JDK,SDK, etc..)My PC:  Core i7 cpu; 12G memory; 4Gb AMD graphics radeon r5 m230For me the Android Studio was consuming a lot of resources and making my computer unusable! So what I did was a clean deletion of Android Studio and installing ECLIPSE!\nTrust me now my PC is working with a speed of Lamborghini! \nI hope google fixes its speed. It\'s a GOOD IDE but it uses too many resources so its slow. Adding more memory helped me:Android Studio 2.1.2 Edit Custom VM Options:like below:Disable VCS by using File > Settings > Plugins and disable the following things :\nCVS Integration;  Git Integration; GitHub; Google Cloud ... things; Subversion Integration; hg4idea;\nEditor is ta resource eating too (especially on Large Monitors) and annoying slow. Make it much much faster: click Help > Edit custom VM options and add these lines :-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false\n-Dsun.java2d.opengl=truesave it and Restart Android Studio.Modules are expensive\xe2\x80\xa6 I mean.. REALLY expensive!  On my current project at linkedcare.com I had to build some libraries from scratch and had to fork some that almost fitted my needs but not quite! If that modules are not constantly modified, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to have this into consideration: the time needed to compile them from scratch, or even to check if the previous individual module build is up-to-date, can be up to almost 4x greater than to simply load that dependency as a binary .jar/.aar.Hint: run the gradle build -profile for an HTML report showing where\n  the time goes regarding the build process.Note: keep that \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d modules in your version control system\n  for the eventuallity of a quickfix/improvement in that dependency.In your Gradle build script, use only \nspecific Google Service, like:   compile \'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:8.3.0\'\nInstead of full Google Library:  compile \'com.google.android.gms:play-services:8.3.0\'\n(Compile time goes from 2 minutes to around 25 seconds).Gradle configures every project before executing tasks, regardless of whether the project is actually needed for the particular build. In global gradle.properties adding this will help much: org.gradle.configureondemand=true Surprisingly (i dont know why), some people say , they solved problem by reducing: 1) heapsizes to  -Xmx256m (instead of higher values);  2) Emulator Ram-size (from Edit AVD > Advanced Settings);It\'s not compiling that\'s hurting me here, it\'s the typing. I could disable all the smart features and be back to notepad++ like TomTsagk suggested in a comment. For today I need more cores and RAM.Playing devil\'s advocate I\'d argue that typing shouldn\'t require a 16Gb PC octacore PC. Liked Sajan Rana\'s advice but things are so slow here it felt mostly a placebo.To be fair I am using 1.4RC1, which is just short of being in the stable branch. Turning the internet off helped a little. The new feature of simultaneous Design (Preview) and Text views working with XML layouts is very helpful.No, it is ridiculous. Never leave the stable channel.Just for anyone looking, after upgrading to El Capitan, I noticed a huge lag with the IDE. After increasing a ton of RAM and using the suggestions above, it turned out that I needed to update the legacy Java, and reinstall via: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_USAfter installing this, all lag was gone.As you are learning, performance problems with AS are not trivial to diagnose!  In my case, an array of 9215-character-long strings (see below) was causing AS to dump threads every time I typed a few characters.  The thread dump in turn caused AS to freeze for many seconds at a time.  This bug appeared in the Windows 64 bit release of AS 2.2, still occurs in 2.2.1, but was not present in 2.1.Finding out that long strings were causing my lockups involved a lot of trial and error.  But, I learned a lot in the process, to wit:BTW, for the present I have worked around the problem I describe above by moving my long strings into a separate file (a new class containing only the array itself).  I try not to edit this file with AS:In case setting -Xmx4096m -XX:MaxHeapSize=256m (and etc.. mentioned in above answers) doest work, then do this manually:Step 1 : Start Android studio and close any open project (File > Close Project).Step 2 : On Welcome window, Go to Configure > Settings.Step 3 : Go to Build, Execution, Deployment > CompilerStep 4 : Change Build process heap size (Mbytes) to 1024 and Additional build process to VM Options to -Xmx512m.Step 5 : Close or Restart Android Studio.I just want to share my case:I\'m using ubuntu 32bit 4GB RAM. that\'s all the issue I ever encounter with AS.I\'ve quickly resolved this issue by upgrading gradle (Android Studio seems to use old version). 1) Download latest version (https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) and unpack somewhere.\n 2) Update path in Android Studio: File > Settings > Build, Ex../GradleThis worked for me!\nOpen build.gradle (it\'s inside your project) and change the both jcenter to mavenCentral (you can do it in Global file too: C:\\Program Files\\AndroidStudio\\plugins\\android\\lib\\templates\\gradle-projects\\NewAndroidProject\\root\\build.gradle.ftl  however, you will need to do this modification again after AndroidStudio upgrade)DO NOT EDIT studio.vmoptions ,It may not work.Add follow to gradle.properties file in app directory :In one particular system I looked at, this issue was caused by an over-zealous anti-virus that was interfering with Gradle, the build manager for Android Studio. It seems every time Gradle was "touching" a .jar file, the virus checker was unzipping the .jar and scanning it for viruses first. The Gradle build could only continue once the unzipping and scan was complete, thus leading to very long build times (5 min plus). Since Android Studio, by default, runs a Gradle build when you start up, it manifests as an extremely slow start-up.The problem is extremely easy to check for: To solve this, you will have to add the correct directories to the "excluded folders" of your anti-virus. Assume that your Windows username is "Username" and you have installed Android Studio on C: drive. You would then request to exclude from the virus check the following directories:Please note that you may need to take additional security precautions if you exclude these directories and you should co-operate with your security department in the workplace. This may involve setting up your own Maven repository if deemed necessary.(I am aware that this is a late answer, but none of the previous answers have addressed this potential issue)I noticed that AS transfers too much data from/to HDD. It is very annoying, especially when starting to write a new line of code. So, I think, better will be reinstalling a hard disk with SSD. I have i5 with 6 Gb of memory, and the CPU seldom loads more than 50% even at build time. So, the most weak place is HDD.Click Help > Edit Custom properties and add this line:... worked successfully for me to fix the speed issues (Windows 10 64-bit). It\'s absolute voodoo as far as I\'m concerned (I haven\'t done any research on why that should work), and there is a warning above that property that it can cause blinking and fail to repaint on some graphics cards, but there you go. (Inspired by LairdPleng\'s comment, further information)SSD usage is recommended. Check that project and repository caches (~/.gradle/, ~/.m2/repository if you use maven repository) is placed on SSD too. Yes, it reduces some SSD resource, but speed up development as rocket (\'SSD for you\', not \'you for SSD\').More details about improvements read this post. I should mention that if you are using Mac, downloading and running an app from the App Store (like "iBoostUp" etc.)  which will clean out unused system files can speed up your computer dramatically, including AS.I also found that adding more memory to my Mac sped up AS as well.Okay. I will agree that every answer written above will somehow help the cause. I am one of those who is on the same boat. With nothing working my way, and Android Studio refusing to build on the Offline mode due to the associated dependencies, I did something that eased my problem within minutes.Every time I build the gradle, I turn off my internet. ( Notice that the Offline mode is not checked). I don\'t know how and why but this works.Well, one thing that worked for me is using physical android device instead of emulator. As in my PC( i5 and 4GB RAM ) the android studio takes about 700MB of memory and the emulator takes another 700. Thus the whole performance of the computer goes down. Working with a physical device saves the strain from the emulator.Even i do have core i5 machine and 4GB RAM, i do face the same issue. On clean and rebuild the project gradle build system downloads the files jar/lib fresh files from internet. You need to disable this option available in settings of your Android studio. This will re-use the cached lib/jar files. Also the speed of Android studio depends on speed of your hard disk also. Here is detailed blog-post on how to improve too slow Android studio.There are many ways to speed up Android Studio.Speed up gradle build time.1.Go to Project gradle.properties file and remove comment from both line.2.copy gradle.properties file to your .gradle folder so that you don\'t need to setup for every project.Enable Work Offline so that Android studio/Gradle don\'t need to check for newer file over internet every time.Please add in setting.gradle (root folder)My Android Studio was not only slow in general use, but also when building. Here\'s what I did:It\'s fast now.My Story before that:My laptop sports an Intel Core i7-3612QM and 8gig of ram. When I builded, all the 4 cores/8 threads were on 100% usage. My entire system froze until the ~10 minute wass done. Gradle took me like ~10 unproductive minutes of slow down. This is very annoying. I am using Android Studio since 1.4. There were also tremendous slow down when I copy paste code to and from, selecting menus, right-click context menus, editing manifest, editing gradle files, opening layout files, rendering in the UI Editor, etc. Its was very unusable most of the time.Due to frustration, I did the above steps.  Its fast now. Very usable just as before. I build for only ~20 seconds compare to ~10minutes before that. Also, Android Studio eats about 6gig with emulator and browser with lots of tab open, unlike before its hovering on 98% RAM usage. Not just that, I even saved 45 gigs of space for whatever reason. I only use couple of SDKs and Emulators when I checked the Android SDK folder, it occupies 45gig of space! I think the IDE is having a hard time accessing/IO on my SDK folder.If you\'ve tried other given solutions and still experiencing the same issue, it may be time to remove Android IDE/SDKs altogether and start anew (it might take you sometime to setup that newly, but its worth it. Considering I\'ve been suffering this sluggishness for months and cost me my productivity).I really guess that this might be caused by cumulative patches that has been done since then. Or the 45 gig SDK folder on my poorly defragmented drive. I don\'t know and I could be wrong.Thank you! HTH
