Is it valid html to have the following:So when you submit "b" you only get the fields within the inner form. When you submit "a" you get all fields minus those within "b".If it isn\'t possible, what workarounds for this situation are available?A. It is not valid HTML nor XHTMLIn the official W3C XHTML specification, Section B. "Element Prohibitions", states that:http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#prohibitionsAs for the older HTML 3.2 spec,\nthe section on the FORMS element states that:"Every form must be enclosed within a\n  FORM element. There can be several\n  forms in a single document, but the\n  FORM element can\'t be nested."B. The WorkaroundHowever, someone has already attempted that at:"How to create a nested form."http://blog.avirtualhome.com/how-to-create-nested-forms/Note: Although one can trick the W3C Validators to pass a page by manipulating the DOM via scripting, it\'s still not legal HTML. The problem with using such approaches is that the behavior of your code is now not guaranteed across browsers. (since it\'s not standard) In case someone find this post here is a great solution without the need of JS. Use two submit buttons with different name attributes check in your server language which submit button was pressed cause only one of them will be sent to the server.The server side could look something like this if you use php:HTML 4.x & HTML5 disallow nested forms, but HTML5 will allow a workaround with "form" attribute ("form owner").As for HTML 4.x you can:As others have said, it is not valid HTML.It sounds like your are doing this to position the forms visually within each other. If that is the case, just do two separate forms and use CSS to position them.No, the HTML specification states that no FORM element should contain another FORM element.rather use a custom javascript-method inside the action attribute of the form!egno,\nsee w3cYou can answer your own question very easily by inputting the HTML code into the W3 Validator. (It features a text input field, you won\'t even have to put your code on a server...)(And no, it won\'t validate.)A possibility is to have an iframe inside the outer form. The iframe contains the inner form. Make sure to use the <base target="_parent" /> tag inside the head tag of the iframe to make the form behave as part of the main page.If you need your form to submit/commit data to a 1:M relational database, I would recommend creating an "after insert" DB trigger on table A that will insert the necessary data for table B.No, it is not valid. But a "solution" can be creating a modal window outside of form "a" containing the form "b".It can be easily done if you are using bootstrap or materialize css. \nI\'m doing this to avoid using iframe.
