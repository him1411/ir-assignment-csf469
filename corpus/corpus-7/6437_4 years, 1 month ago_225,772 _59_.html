I am new to angular. I am trying to read the uploaded file path from HTML \'file\' field whenever a \'change\' happens on this field. If i use \'onChange\' it works but when i use it angular way using \'ng-change\' it doesn\'t work.fileNameChaged() is never calling. Firebug also doesn\'t show any error.No binding support for File Upload controlhttps://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1375 instead of can you tryNote: this requires the angular application to always be in debug mode. This will not work in production code if debug mode is disabled.and in your function changes\ninstead ofcan you tryBelow is one working example of file upload with drag drop file upload may be helpful\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/danielzen/utp7j/Angular File Upload InformationURL for AngularJS File Upload in ASP.Nethttp://cgeers.com/2013/05/03/angularjs-file-upload/AngularJs native multi-file upload with progress with NodeJShttp://jasonturim.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/angularjs-native-multi-file-upload-with-progress/ngUpload - An AngularJS Service for uploading files using iframe http://ngmodules.org/modules/ngUploadI made a small directive to listen for file input changes.View JSFiddleview.html:controller.js:directive.js:This is a refinement of some of the other ones around, the data will end up in an ng-model, which is normally what you want.Markup (just make an attribute data-file so the directive can find it)JSThe clean way is to write your own directive to bind to "change" event.\nJust to let you know IE9 does not support FormData so you cannot really get the file object from the change event.You can use ng-file-upload library which already supports IE with FileAPI polyfill and simplify the posting the file to the server. It uses a directive to achieve this. JS:I\'ve expanded on @Stuart Axon\'s idea to add two-way binding for the file input (i.e. allow resetting the input by resetting the model value back to null):DemoSimilar to some of the other good answers here, I wrote a directive to solve this problem, but this implementation more closely mirrors the angular way of attaching events. You can use the directive like this:HTMLAs you can see, you can inject the files selected into your event handler, as you would inject an $event object into any ng event handler.JavascriptThis directive pass the selected files as well:The HTML, how to use it:In my controller:I recommend to create a directivethis directive can be used many times, it uses its own scope and doesn\'t depend on parent scope. You can also give some params to handler function. Handler function will be called with scope object, that was active when you changed the input. \n$apply updates your model each time the change event is called The simplest Angular jqLite version.JS:HTML:Too complete solution base on:A simple way to hide the input field and replace it with a image, here after a solution, that also require a hack on angular but that do the job [TriggerEvent does not work as expected]The solution:When the image is clicked simulate a DOM action \'click\' on the input field. Et voil\xc3\xa0!I have done it like this;Another interesting way to listen file input changes is with a watch over the ng-model attribute of the input file. Off course FileModel is a custom directive.Like this:HTML -> <input type="file" file-model="change.fnEvidence">JS Code ->Hope it can helps someone.To make an <input type=file> element work the ng-change directive, it needs a custom directive that works with the ng-model directive.Angular elements (such as the root element of a directive) are jQuery [Lite] objects. This means we can register the event listener like so:This is jQuery event delegation. Here, the listener is attached to the root element of the directive. When the event is triggered, it will bubble up to the registered element and jQuery will determine if the event originated on an inner element matching the defined selector. If it does, the handler will fire.Benefits of this method are:http://api.jquery.com/on/
