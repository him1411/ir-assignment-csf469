In a programming language (Python, C#, etc) I need to determine how to calculate the angle between a line and the horizontal axis?I think an image describes best what I want:Given (P1x,P1y) and (P2x,P2y) what is the best way to calculate this angle? The origin is in the topleft and only the positive quadrant is used.First find the difference between the start point and the end point (here, this is more of a directed line segment, not a "line", since lines extend infinitely and don\'t start at a particular point).Then calculate the angle (which runs from the positive X axis at P1 to the positive Y axis at P1).But arctan may not be ideal, because dividing the differences this way will erase the distinction needed to distinguish which quadrant the angle is in (see below). Use the following instead if your language includes an atan2 function:EDIT (Feb. 22, 2017): In general, however, calling atan2(deltaY,deltaX) just to get the proper angle for cos and sin may be inelegant. In those cases, you can often do the following instead:EDIT (Feb. 28, 2017): Even without normalizing (deltaX, deltaY):An implementation in Python using radians (provided on July 19, 2015 by Eric Leschinski, who edited my answer):All tests pass. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circleSorry, but I\'m pretty sure Peter\'s answer is wrong. Note that the y axis goes down the page (common in graphics). As such the deltaY calculation has to be reversed, or you get the wrong answer.Consider:givesSo if in the example above, P1 is (1,1) and P2 is (2,2) [because Y increases down the page], the code above will give 45.0 degrees for the example shown, which is wrong. Change the order of the deltaY calculation and it works properly.I have found a solution in Python that is working well !Considering the exact question, putting us in a "special" coordinates system where positive axis means moving DOWN (like a screen or an interface view), you need to adapt this function like this, and negative the Y coordinates:Example in Swift 2.0This function gives a correct answer to the question. Answer is in radians, so the usage, to view angles in degrees, is: Based on reference "Peter O".. Here is the java versionmatlab function:
