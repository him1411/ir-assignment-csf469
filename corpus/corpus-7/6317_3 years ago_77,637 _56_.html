What worked for me here was using a jpg file instead of PNG as jpg files don\'t use alpha or transparency features. I did it via online image converter or you can also open the image in preview and then File->Export and uncheck alpha as option to save the image and use this image.To get around the problem I batched converted using fireworks my png32 files to png24 for upload quick and easy. Jpeg works also but it is lossy.Faced same issue, Try using JPG format !!If you have imagemagick installed, then you can put the following alias into your .bash_profile.  It will convert every png in a directory to a jpg, which automatically removes the alpha.
