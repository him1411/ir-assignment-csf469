What\'s the quickest and easiest way to get the Min (or Max) value between two dates? Is there an equivalent to Math.Min (& Math.Max) for dates?I want to do something like:Obviously the above Math.Min doesn\'t work because they\'re dates.There is no overload for DateTime values, but you can get the long value Ticks that is what the values contain, compare them and then create a new DateTime value from the result:(Note that the DateTime structure also contains a Kind property, that is not retained in the new value. This is normally not a problem; if you compare DateTime values of different kinds the comparison doesn\'t make sense anyway.)There\'s no built in method to do that. You can use the expression:to find the maximum of the two.You can write a generic method to calculate Min or Max for any type (provided that Comparer<T>.Default is set appropriately):You can use LINQ too:How about:Works with any type that supports IComparable<T> or IComparable.Actually, with LINQ, another alternative is:This allows the dates to have different \'kinds\' and returns the instance that was passed in (not returning a new DateTime constructed from Ticks or Milliseconds).Note that this test would fail East of Greenwich...If you want to call it more like Math.Max, you can do something like this very short expression body:Linq.Min() / Linq.Max() approach:http://jsfiddle.net/5CR37/
