I am trying to get Eclipse v3.5 (Galileo) to re-run on my computer - I have run it before with no problems, but now I keep getting this error:A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development kit (JDK) must be available in order to run Eclipse. No Java virtual machine was found after searching the following locations:\n  C:\\eclipse\\jre\\javaw.exe\n  javaw.exe in your current PATHI\'ve just done a fresh install of both the JDK and the SDK.I have Windows 7 (x64).What\'s up with this? How do I fix it?I can\'t run any of the ipconfig / tracert / or ping.Eclipse will by default try to launch with the default "java.exe" (the first one referenced by your PATH)Three things to remember:June 2012, jmbertucci comments:I\'m running Windows 7 64-bit and I had the 32-bit JRE installed.\n  I downloaded Eclipse 64-bit which looks for a 64-bit JRE.\n  Because I didn\'t have the 64-bit JRE it threw the error, which makes sense.I went to the Java manual install page (which was not as directly accessible as you\'d like) and installed the 64-bit version. See "Java Downloads for All Operating Systems".\n  That was all I needed.April 2016: Steve Mayne adds in the comments:I had to edit the eclipse.ini file to reference the correct Java path -\n  Eclipse doesn\'t use the environment PATH at all when there is a value in eclipse.ini.Just copy this file :to Eclipse Folder *note only tested for Windows All the other answers about setting only the JAVA_HOME are not entirely right. Eclipse does namely not consult the JAVA_HOME. Look closer at the error message:...in your current PATHIt literally said PATH, not JAVA_HOME.Rightclick My Computer and choose Properties (or press Winkey+Pause), go to the tab Advanced, click the button Environment Variables, in the System Variables list at the bottom select Path (no, not Classpath), click Edit and add ;c:\\path\\to\\jdk\\bin to the end of the value.Alternatively and if not present, you can also add JAVA_HOME environment variable and make use of it in the PATH. In the same dialogue click New and add JAVA_HOME with the value of c:\\path\\to\\jdk. Then you can add ;%JAVA_HOME%\\bin to end of the value of the Path setting.Open up Windows\' System Properties from the control panel and hunt down the environment variables section:Most Java tools will now be able to find your Java installation either by using the JAVA_HOME environment variable or by looking for java.exe / javaw.exe in the Path environment variable.If you download the 64 bit version of Eclipse; it will look for the 64 bit version of JRE.\nIf you download the 32 bit version of Eclipse; it will look for the 32 bit version of JREWhat I did was to install the both the 32 and 64 bit version of JRE.  You can get that from the SUN Oracle site.  The JAVA site seems to automatically install the 32 bit version of Java.  I guess that\'s because of the web browser.It turned out that all I needed to do was change the \'path\' to:"C:\\Windows\\system32;C:\\Windows;C:\\Windows\\System32\\Wbem;\n  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java;\n  C:\\Program Files\n  (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_14\\bin"that did it :)I have windows 7 64-bit, and I had this same problem with eclipse. To get it to work, I had to use internet explorer (64-bit version) to download java. This was the only way to get java to install a 64-bit version. When I used firefox to install java, it automatically installed a 32-bit version (so idiotic!). And The Eclipse 64-bit version wouldn\'t detect the java 32-bit version.Solution in a nutshell:Right-click on My Computer, click properties, then advanced system settings, a System properties window will popup, under advanced tab, choose environment variables, Environment variables window will popup, under the System variables section , look for PATH variable, and edit the value, changing it (the version; jre6,jre7, etc) to whatever jre you\'re using, e.g for mine: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre7\\binDon\'t worry i was also ruined by this error and fatal and when i got it i was so frustrate even i was giving to leave an android programming, but i got it,                          Simply first of all copy this code and paste in your system variable Under path ...C:\\Program Files;C:\\Winnt;C:\\Winnt\\System32;C:\\Program\n  Files\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\javaw.exeNow copy the "jre" folder from your path like i have have "jre" under this path and paste it in your eclipse folder means where your eclipse.exe file is placed. like i have my eclipse set up in this locationSo inside the eclipse Folder paste the "jre" FOLDER . If you have "jre6" then rename it as "jre"....and run your eclipse you will got the solution...  OTHER SOLUTION: 2If the problem could\'t solve with the above steps, then follow these steps-vmF:\\Softwares\\LANGUAGES SOFTEARE\\Android Setup\\eclipse Indigo version 32 Bit\\jre\\bin/javaw.exeNow this time when you will start eclipse it will search for javaw.exe, so it will search the path in the eclipse.ini, as it is now in the same folder so, it will start the javaw.exe and it will start working.If You still have any query you can ask it again, just go on my profile and find out my email id. because i love stack overflow forum, and it made me a programmer.*In your eclipse.ini file, you need to update the path to the VM to point to the same location where javaw.exe is installed on your machine.Do not rely on the windows path variable because it gets changed in nearly every update. E.g. a chrome (32bit on a 64 bit machine) java update replaces the systemwide 64 bit JVM by a 32 bit JVM. Note also that this entry has to be the last one in the eclipse.ini, otherwise it does not work,And - as otherwise stated - the JAVA_HOME variable is NOT evaluated by eclipse.exe.even if your has JAVA_HOME and Path configured valid,their may has this problem,so\nthe most simple way to do is open your eclipse.ini in your eclipse installtion folder-vmC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_71\\bin\\javaw.exereplace C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_71\\bin\\javaw.exe with your jdk or jre `s pathmake a batch file in the eclipse folder and write in it :see\nhttp://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_run_Eclipse%3FEdited my eclipse.ini file to update the newly  updated JDK. Previously I had jdk1.7.0_09 and updated now to jdk1.7.0_80 and eclipse threw this error.A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) must be available in order to run Eclipse. No\n  Java virtual machine was found after searching the following\n  locations: C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_09/bin/javawAfter updating eclipse.ini from,toEclipse works fine.When I had such problem, in my case I had x64 JDK + JRE installed with x86 Eclipse. So installing of x86 JDK + JRE solved my problem :) Also I created jre folder in eclipse folder and copied bin folder from my local path C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7 to ..\\eclipse\\jre\\.if you update your java version with default update in your 64 bit computer (and you have 32 bit browser), java will install 32 bit version. You should find 64 bit java version and install it. I had a co-worker with this exact problem last week. He fixed it by installing the x64 version of Eclipse and the x64 JDK.Edit: he reused his old workspace after installing the necessary plugins, so that should not be much of an issue There is an easier way to do that. Just run cmd x64. Type cmd x64 to search bar in start menu ant you will find it :) Or alternatively, you should set path to program files (x86) ... For example C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre6 Just Add the JRE PATH FOR Ex: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre5\\bin in the environmental variable\nPut ";" in between every path. Then click the eclipse.exe It will work.....The reason you get this error is because eclipse needs a JRE to launch, which it can\'t find. The first place it searches is the current directory, then the eclipse.ini file and then finally the system path. So if the it can\'t find the correct jvm(bit versions are different) through any of these three places, it cribsThe recommended way is to edit the eclipse.ini file and tell eclipse where exactly to look for the vm/jre, by including this line in the file:-vm\n[path to your java.exe] (which is generally under "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre7\\bin")P.S. To edit the eclipse.ini, you may need to move the it, edit and then paste it backSource:-  wikiFirst of all thanks to YouYou for his solution! I tried answer by YouYou (https://stackoverflow.com/a/14464653/801919). Initially, it did not work for me. Following are the steps that I needed to take to make it work:...And Eclipse started working!!! Yaay!Well this answer is to those who tried all of them others an still no luck, May this be Android studio or Eclipse i usually do this when everything else fails.set java_exe=call lib\\find_java.batif not defined java_exe goto :EOFChange them to set java_exe= <the path to your java.exe file(can be found inside your jdk folder/bin directory)>find the lines rem Set SWT.Jar path based on current architecture (x86 or x86_64)\nfor /f "delims=" %%a in (\'"%java_exe%" -jar lib\\archquery.jar\') do set swt_path=lib\\%%aTry setting your JAVA_HOME to the correct folder. Google for setting environment variables in Windows.Check Window > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs.  Make sure there\'s something there;  if there isn\'t, add one.Did you recently update your JDK?The JDK does not install a JVM in the default path.Unless you need external tools to run like ant, the non-JDK is enough for Eclipse to run.  The easiest way to install such a JVM is to go to http://java.com and let it install whatever it want to install. Then double-click the Eclipse binary again.set JAVA_HOME variable and ad JAVA_HOME/bin to evnrionment path variable.I had the same issue (Windows 7 x64, 64bit JDK, 32bit Eclipse), and I found 2 solutions:I had the same problem.  The easy way, for me to fix it was to install both the JRE and the eclipse as x86 or x64.  When their bit type did not match, eclipse could not find it.  So, if it is not a big deal for you to uninstall and reinstall in order to make them match, I would do that.I ended up installing:\nJava Runtime Environment 1.7.0.3 (64-bit) and\nEclipse Indigo (3.7) (64-bit)Then it just works.When I copied only javaw, the second error occured, there is not a java.dll file, when I copied it too, eclipse did not start, what I did was that I copied whole jdk folder to eclipse folder and renamed id to jre. Problem solved.One problem is the conflict between the Eclipse-64bit version and our Java installation being 32bit version.  This doesn\'t get solved easily because the Java installation page doesn\'t give the option for 64bit - it assumes 32bit and downloads and installs the 32bit version.  To overcome this issue, please follow the following steps:Install Eclipse.--launcher.appendVmargs\n-vm\nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_79\\jre\\bin\\javaw.exe\n-vmargsif after adding the C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_92\\bin in PATH variable in environment variables the eclipse gave the same errorcheck eclipse configuration settings file that found in eclipse folder, you must see the same jdk path you have in C:\\program FilesI hope it help.
