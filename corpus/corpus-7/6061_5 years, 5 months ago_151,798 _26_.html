I have this Twitter Bootstrap code But when I am viewing the beginning of the page, the nav bar is blocking some of the content that is near the top of the page.  Any idea for how to make it push down the rest of the content lower when the top of the page is viewed so that the content isn\'t blocked by the nav bar?Add to your CSS:From the Bootstrap docs:The fixed navbar will overlay your other content, unless you add padding to the top of the body.Adding a padding like that is not enough if you\'re using responsive bootstrap. In this case when you resize your window you\'ll get a gap between top of the page and navbar. A proper solution looks like this:For bootstrap 3, navbar-static-top instead of fixed prevents this issue, unless you need the navbar to always be visible.a much more handy solution for your reference, it works perfect in all of my projects:change your first \'div\' fromtoI am using jQuery to solve this problem. This is the snippet for BS 3.0.0:In my project derived from the MVC 5 tutorial I found that changing the body padding had no effect. The following worked for me:It resolves the cases where the navbar folds into 2 or 3 lines. This can be inserted into bootstrap.css anywhere after the lines\n    body {\n      margin: 0;\n    }I\'ve had good success with creating a dummy non-fixed nav bar right before my real fixed nav bar.The spacing works out great on all screen sizes.As seen on this example from Twitter, add this before the line that includes the responsive styles declarations:Like so:Using MVC 5, the way I fixed mine, was to simply add my own Site.css, loaded after the others, with the following line:\nbody{padding: 0}and I changed the code in the beginning of _Layout.cshtml, to be:using percentage is much better solution than pixels.If needed you can still be explicit by adding different breakpoints as mentioned in another answer by @spajuswith navbar navbar-default everything works fine, but if you are using navbar-fixed-top you have to include custom style body { padding-top: 60px;} otherwise it will block content underneath. you should add to not destroy a sticky footer or something elseIf your navbar is on the top of the page originally, set the value to 0. Otherwise, set the value for data-offset-topto the value of the content above your navbar.Meanwhile, you need to modify the css as such:
