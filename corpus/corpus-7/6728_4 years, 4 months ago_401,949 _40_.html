I\'m building a web application using Visual Studio 2012. \nI\'m attempting to add word count into my textbox. \nHowever after adding the the javascript codes and the html codes. I receive the error as stated above.Here is my javascript codedsCode : Server codes in master page ASPX codes, ( Html codes ) You need a web.config key to enable the pre 4.5 validation mode.More Info on ValidationSettings:UnobtrusiveValidationMode:Specifies how ASP.NET globally enables the built-in validator controls\n  to use unobtrusive JavaScript for client-side validation logic.Type: UnobtrusiveValidationModeDefault value: NoneRemarks: If this key value is set to "None" [default], the ASP.NET\n  application will use the pre-4.5 behavior (JavaScript inline in\n  the pages) for client-side validation logic. If this key value is set\n  to "WebForms", ASP.NET uses HTML5 data-attributes and late bound\n  JavaScript from an added script reference for client-side validation\n  logic.Example:Rather than disabling a new feature, I opted to follow the instructions of the error. In my global.asax.cs I added:This comes from an msdn blog post which highlights some of the advantages of script resource mappings.  Of particular interest to me was centralized control over the delivery of the script files based on "debug=true", EnableCDN, etc.There are at least three ways to disable the use of unobtrusive JavaScript for client-side validation:To disable the functionality on a per page basis, I prefer to set the Page.UnobtrusiveValidationMode property using the page directive:Unobtrusive validation is enabled by default in new version of ASP.NET.  Unobtrusive validation aims to decrease the page size by replacing the inline JavaScript for performing validation with a small JavaScript library that uses jQuery.You can either disable it by editing web.config to include the following:Or better yet properly configure it by modifying the Application_Start method in global.asax:Page 399 of Beginning ASP.NET 4.5.1 in C# and VB provides a discussion on the benefit of unobtrusive validation and a walkthrough for configuring it.For those looking for RouteConfig.  It is added automatically when you make a new project in visual studio to the App_Code folder.  The contents look something like this:to add a little more to the answer from b_levitt...\non global.asax:on your default.aspx I believe I have encountered the same quandary. I started encountering the problem when I changed to:Which gives the error message you describe above.adding:Solves the issue, but then it makes your validation controls/scripts throw Javascript runtime errors.\nIf you change to:You should be OK, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make sure the rest of your code does/ behaves as desired. You might also have to forgo some new features only available in 4.5 onward.P.S. It is highly recommended that you read the following before implementing this solution. Especially, if you use Async functionality:https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2012/11/19/all-about-httpruntime-targetframework/UPDATE April 2017:\nAfter some some experimentation and testing I have come up with a combination that works:with:jQuery version 1.11.3The problem occurred due to the Control validator. Just Add the J Query reference to your web page as follows and then add the Validation Settings in your web.config file to overcome the problem. I too faced the same problem and the below gave the solution to my problem.Step1:Step2 :It will resolve your problem.If your code or configuration looks correct after looking at the other answers, I also had this issue with a deployed (development staging) web site and found that the problem was that the Global.asax file had been renamed. (By me, a few days earlier when messing with customErrors and the Application_Error)
