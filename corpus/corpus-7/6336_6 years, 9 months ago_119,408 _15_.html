I have been attempting the following command:  SSH is running on port 2222, but rsync still tries to use port 22 and then complains about not finding the path, cause of course it does not exist.  I would like to know if it is possible to rsync to a remote host on a non-standard ssh port.Your command line should look like this:this works fine - I use it all the time without needing any new firewall rules - just note the SSH command itself is enclosed in quotes.Another option, in the host you run rsync from, set the port in the ssh config file, ie:Then rsync over ssh will talk to port 2222:when you need to send files through a specific SSH port:exampleuse the "rsh option" . e.g.: refer to: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/rsync-ssh-on-different-port-448112/A bit offtopic but might help someone. If you need to pass password and port I suggest using sshpass package. Command line command would look like this:\nsshpass -p "password" rsync -avzh -e \'ssh -p PORT312\' root@192.xx.xxx.xxx:/dir_on_host/I found this solution on Mike Hike Hostetler\'s site that worked perfectly for me.Thanks Mike I was not able to get rsync to connect via ssh on a different port, but I wasn able to redirect the ssh connection to the computer I wanted via iptables.  This is not the solution I was looking for, but it solved my problem.
