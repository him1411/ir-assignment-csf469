From code, how do I hide the EditText underbar (the prompt line with little serifs at the ends)?  There might be a better way to do what I want:  I have a layout with an EditText.  Normally, this displays fine where the user can tap on it and begin entering or editing text.Sometimes, however, I would like to use the same layout (simplifies other logic) to display the same data in a readonly manner.  I want the presentation to be similar - it should have the same height and same font, but not have the underbar.As a stop-gap measure, I\'m going to implement this by removing the EditText and substituting a TextView.  I think that will give the desired results, but it seems like a roundabout an expensive way to do something that ought to be easy to do by changing attributes.You can set the EditText to have a custom transparent drawable or just use android:background="@android:color/transparent".Set background to null.Please set your edittext background as android:background="#00000000"It will work.You can set EditText\'s  backgroundTint value to a specific color.\nIf you set transparent color, underbar should gone.android:backgroundTint="@color/Transparent"<color name="Transparent">#00000000</color>But you can use this in Api v21(Lollipop) or higherWhat I did was to create a Shape drawable and set that as the background:Note: I actually used @dimen and @color values for the firelds, but I\'ve simplified the shape file here for clarity.Using either property:ORworked for me to hide the underline of the However, do note that it then causes a spacing issue with the TextInputLayout that I\'ve surrounding the EditTextYou can do it programmatically using setBackgroundResource:I discovered the most curious thing! If you set it to null using Data Binding:\nandroid:background="@{null}"Then not only is the background removed, but the view still has the padding that was calculated from the default background. So for some reason the deferred null setting doesn\'t clear the padding from the previous bg..? The padding on the view is left/top/right 4dp, bottom 13dp (from emulator level 21).May not have same end result on all API levels, so beware! Someone tell me if you test this and find it reliable. (Also note that that bottom padding sticks out because of that underline that was in the original. So you\'ll probably want to change it in the XML, or reset it in the code after it\'s loaded to equal top...if your edit text already has a background then you can use following.
