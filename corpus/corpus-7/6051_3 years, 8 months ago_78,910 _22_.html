I\'ve just joined a project, and I\'m new to travis-ci.  I\'d rather not have to push every little change to .travis.yml and every little change I make to the source in order to run the build.  With jenkins you can download jenkins and run locally.  Does travis offer something like this?Note: I\'ve seen the travis-ci cli and downloaded it, but all it seems to do is call their API, which then connects to my github repo, so if I don\'t push, it won\'t matter that I restart the last build.Travis-ci offers a new container-based infrastructure that uses docker.   This can be very useful if you\'re trying to troubleshoot a travis-ci build by reproducing it locally.  This is taken from Travis CI\'s documentation.If you\'re having trouble tracking down the exact problem in a build it often helps to run the build locally. To do this you need to be using our container based infrastructure (ie, have sudo: false in your .travis.yml), and to know which Docker image you are using on Travis CI.Select an image from Quay.io. If you\'re not using a language-specific image pick travis-ruby. Open a terminal and start an interactive Docker session using the image URL:Switch to the travis user:According to the Travis documentation: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci there is a concoction of projects that collude to deliver the Travis CI web service we know and love. The following subset of projects appears to allow local make test functionality using the .travis.yml in your project:travis-build creates the build\nscript for each job. It takes the configuration from the .travis.yml file and\ncreates a bash script that is then run in the build environment by\ntravis-worker.travis-cookbooks holds the\nChef cookbooks that are used to provision the build environments.travis-worker is responsible for\nrunning the build scripts in a clean environment. It streams the log output to\ntravis-logs and pushes state updates (build starting/finishing)\nto travis-hub.(The other subprojects are responsible for communicating with GitHub, their web interface, email, and their API.)you can try https://github.com/jolicode/JoliCiit use docker to try to be a local replacement for travis-ci. it should support php, nodejs & ruby. if there is something missing you can file a bug on the project pageSimilar to Scott McLeod\'s but this also generates a bash script to run the steps from the .travis.yml.Use wwtd (what would travis do) ruby gem to run tests on your local machine roughly as they would run on travis.It will recreate the build matrix and run each configuration, great to sanity check setup before pushing.I\'m not sure what was your original reason for running Travis locally, if you just wanted to play with it, then stop reading here as it\'s irrelevant for you.If you already have experience with hosted Travis and you want to get the same experience in your own datacenter, read on.Since Dec 2014 Travis CI offers an Enterprise on-premises version.http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-12-19-introducing-travis-ci-enterprise/The pricing is part of the article as well:The licensing is done per seats, where every license includes 20 users.
