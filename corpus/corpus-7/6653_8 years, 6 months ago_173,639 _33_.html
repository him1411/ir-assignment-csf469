Is there a way in C# 3.5 where I can use reflection to set an object property?Ex:I want to set obj.Name with reflection. Something like:Is there a way of doing this?Yes, you can use Type.InvokeMember():This will throw an exception if obj doesn\'t have a property called Name, or it can\'t be set.Another approach is to get the metadata for the property, and then set it. This will allow you to check for the existence of the property, and verify that it can be set:You can also do: where target is the object that will have its property set.Reflection, basically, i.e.or there are libraries to help both in terms of convenience and performance; for example with FastMember:(which also has the advantage of not needing to know in advance whether it is a field vs a property)Or you could wrap Marc\'s one liner inside your own extension class:and call it like this:For good measure, let\'s add a method to get a property value:Yes, using System.Reflection:You can also access fields using a simillar manner:With reflection everything can be an open book:) In my example we are binding to a private instance level field. Use somethings like this :orYou can try this out when you want to mass-assign properties of an Object from another Object using Property names:I have just published a Nuget package that allows setting up not only the first level Properties but also nested properties in the given object in any depth.Here is the packageSets the value of a property of an object by its path from the root.The object can be a complex object and the property can be multi level deep nested property or it can be a property directly under the root. ObjectWriter will find the property using the property path parameter and update its value. Property path is the appended names of the properties visited from root to the end node property which we want to set, delimited by the delimiter string parameter.Usage:For setting up the properties directly under the object root:Ie. LineItem class has an int property called ItemIdFor setting up nested property multiple levels below the object root:Ie. Invite class has a property called State, which has a property called Invite (of Invite type), which has a property called Recipient, which has a property called Id.To make things even more complex, the State property is not a reference type, it is a struct.Here is how you can set the Id property (to string value of \xe2\x80\x9coutlook\xe2\x80\x9d) at the bottom of the object tree in a single line.Based on MarcGravell\'s suggestion, I have constructed the following static method.The method generically assigns all matching properties from source object to target using FastMember
