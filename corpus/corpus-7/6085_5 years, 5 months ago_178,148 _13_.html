Do I have to restart cron after changing the crontable file?No.From the cron man page:...cron will then examine the modification time on all crontabs \n    and reload those which have changed.  Thus cron need not be restarted \n    whenever a crontab file is modifiedBut if you just want to make sure its done anyway,orOn CentOS with cPanel sudo /etc/init.d/crond reload does the trick. On CentOS7: sudo systemctl start crond.serviceDepending on distribution, using "cron reload" might do nothing. To paste a snippet out of init.d/cron (debian squeeze):Some developer/maintainer relied on it reloading, but doesn\'t, and in this case there\'s not a way to force reload. I\'m generating my crontab files as part of a deploy, and unless somehow the length of the file changes, the changes are not reloaded.I had a similar issue on 16.04 VPS Digital Ocean. If you are changing crontabs, make sure to runTry this out: sudo cron reload\nIt works for me on ubuntu 12.10try this one for centos 7 : service crond reload
