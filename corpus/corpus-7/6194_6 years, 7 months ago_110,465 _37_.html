In Python, without using the traceback module, is there a way to determine a function\'s name from within that function?Say I have a module foo with a function bar.  When executing foo.bar(), is there a way for bar to know bar\'s name?  Or better yet, foo.bar\'s name?Python doesn\'t have a feature to access the function or its name within the function itself. It has been proposed but rejected. If you don\'t want to play with the stack yourself, you should either use "bar" or bar.__name__ depending on context.There are a few ways to get the same result:Note that the inspect.stack calls are thousands of times slower than the alternatives:You can get the name that it was defined with using the approach that @Andreas Jung shows, but that may not be the name that the function was called with:Whether that distinction is important to you or not I can\'t say.I wanted a very similar thing because I wanted to put the function name in a log string that went in a number of places in my code. Probably not the best way to do that, but here\'s a way to get the name of the current function.I found a wrapper that will write the function nameThis will printmy_funky_nameSTUBI keep this handy utility nearby:Usage:This is actually derived from the other answers to the question.Here\'s my take:The likely advantage of this version over using inspect.stack() is that it should be thousands of times faster [see Alex Melihoff\'s post and timings regarding using sys._getframe() versus using inspect.stack() ].I guess inspect is the best way to do this. Example:In IDE the code outputshello, I\'m foo, daddy is hello, I\'m bar, daddy is foohello, I\'m bar, daddy is Test:Output:Here\'s a future-proof approach.Combining @CamHart\'s and @Yuval\'s suggestions with @RoshOxymoron\'s accepted answer has the benefit of avoiding:So I think this plays nice with future python versions (tested on 2.7.3 and 3.3.2):print(inspect.stack()[0].function) seems to work too (Python 3.5).You can use a decorator:I do my own approach used for calling super with safety inside multiple inheritance scenario (I put all the code)sample usage:testing it :output:I did what CamHart said:Output:C:\\Python\\Python36\\python.exe C:/Python/GetFunctionsNames/TestFunctionsNames.py\n  myFunctionsHereProcess finished with exit code 0
