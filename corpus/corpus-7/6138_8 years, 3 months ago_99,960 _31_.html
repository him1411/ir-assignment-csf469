I\'m trying to compare a time stamp from an incoming request to a database stored value. SQL Server of course keeps some precision of milliseconds on the time, and when read into a .NET DateTime, it includes those milliseconds. The incoming request to the system, however, does not offer that precision, so I need to simply drop the milliseconds.I feel like I\'m missing something obvious, but I haven\'t found an elegant way to do it (C#).The following will work for a DateTime that has fractional milliseconds, and also preserves the Kind property (Local, Utc or Undefined).or the equivalent and shorter:This could be generalized into an extension method:which is used as follows:Here is an extension method based on a previous answer that will let you truncate to any resolution...Usage:Class:Instead of dropping the milliseconds then comparing, why not compare the difference?orLess obvious but more than 2 times faster :Sometimes you want to truncate to something calendar-based, like year or month. Here\'s an extension method that lets you choose any resolution.Regarding Diadistis response. This worked for me, except I had to use Floor to remove the fractional part of the division before the multiplication. So,becomesI would have expected the division of two Long values to result in a Long, thus removing the decimal part, but it resolves it as a Double leaving the exact same value after the multiplication.Eppsy2 Extension methods for the solutions mentioned aboveusage:And By Use Of :P New Method // define String pass parameter dd-mmm-yyyy  return 24-feb-2016  Or shown on textbox // put on PageonLoadSimple...And more...To round down to the second:Replace with TicksPerMinute to round down to the minute.If your code is performance sensitive, be cautious about My app was spending 12% of CPU time in System.DateTime.GetDatePart.
