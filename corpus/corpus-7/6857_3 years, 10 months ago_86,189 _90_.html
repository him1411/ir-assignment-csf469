I\'m building an iOS app using a Storyboard. The root view controller is a Tab Bar Controller. I\'m creating the login/logout process, and it\'s mostly working fine, but I\'ve got a few issues. I need to know the BEST way to set all this up.I want to accomplish the following:What I\'ve done so far is set the root view controller to the Tab Bar Controller, and created a custom segue to my Login view controller. Inside my Tab Bar Controller class, I check whether they are logged in inside the viewDidAppear method, and a perform the segue: [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@"pushLogin" sender:self]; I also setup a notification for when the logout action needs to be performed: [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(logoutAccount) name:@"logoutAccount" object:nil];Upon logout, I clear the credentials from the Keychain, run [self setSelectedIndex:0] and perform the segue to show the login view controller again.This all works fine, but I\'m wondering: should this logic be in the AppDelegate? I also have two issues:I\'m open to reworking this. I\'ve considered making the login screen the root view controller, or creating a navigation controller in the AppDelegate to handle everything... I\'m just not sure what the best method is at this point.In your appDelegate.m inside your didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsIn SignUpViewController.m fileIn file MyTabThreeViewController.mHere is what I ended up doing to accomplish everything. The only thing you need to consider in addition to this is (a) the login process and (b) where you are storing your app data (in this case, I used a singleton).As you can see, the root view controller is my Main Tab Controller. I did this because after the user has logged in, I want the app to launch directly to the first tab. (This avoids any "flicker" where the login view shows temporarily.)AppDelegate.mIn this file, I check whether the user is already logged in. If not, I push the login view controller. I also handle the logout process, where I clear data and show the login view.LoginViewController.mHere, if the login is successful, I simply dismiss the view and send a notification.EDIT: Add logout action.1. First of all prepare the app delegate fileAppDelegate.hAppDelegate.m2. Create a class named User.User.hUser.m3. Create a new controller RootViewController and connected with the first view, where login button live. Add also a Storyboard ID: "initialView".RootViewController.hRootViewController.m4. Create a new controller LoginViewController and connected with the login view.LoginViewController.hLoginViewController.m5. At the end add a new controller ProfileViewController and connected with the profile view in the tabViewController.ProfileViewController.hProfileViewController.mLoginExample is a sample project for extra help.I didn\'t like bhavya\'s answer because of using AppDelegate inside View Controllers and setting rootViewController has no animation. And Trevor\'s answer has issue with flashing view controller on iOS8.UPD 07/18/2015AppDelegate inside View Controllers:Changing AppDelegate state (properties) inside view controller breaks encapsulation.Very simple hierarchy of objects in every iOS project:AppDelegate (owns window and rootViewController)ViewController (owns view)It\'s ok that objects from the top change objects at the bottom, because they are creating them. But it\'s not ok if objects on the bottom change objects on top of them (I described some basic programming/OOP principle : DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle : high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions)).If any object will change any object in this hierarchy, sooner or later there will be a mess in the code. It might be ok on the small projects but it\'s no fun to dig through this mess on the bit projects =]UPD 07/18/2015I replicate modal controller animations using UINavigationController (tl;dr: check the project).I\'m using UINavigationController to present all controllers in my app. Initially I displayed login view controller in navigation stack with plain push/pop animation. Than I decided to change it to modal with minimal changes. How it works:Initial view controller (or self.window.rootViewController) is UINavigationController with ProgressViewController as a rootViewController. I\'m showing ProgressViewController because DataModel can take some time to initialize because it  inits core data stack like in this article (I really like this approach).AppDelegate is responsible for getting login status updates.DataModel handles user login/logout and AppDelegate is observing it\'s userLoggedIn property via KVO. Arguably not the best method to do this but it works for me. (Why KVO is bad, you can check in this  or this article (Why Not Use Notifications? part).ModalDismissAnimator and ModalPresentAnimator are used to customize default push animation.How animators logic works:AppDelegate sets itself as a delegate of  self.window.rootViewController (which is UINavigationController).AppDelegate returns one of animators in -[AppDelegate navigationController:animationControllerForOperation:fromViewController:toViewController:] if necessary.Animators implement -transitionDuration: and -animateTransition: methods. -[ModalPresentAnimator animateTransition:]:Test project is here. Doing this from the app delegate is NOT recommended. AppDelegate manages the app life cycle that relate to launching, suspending, terminating and so on. I suggest doing this from your initial view controller in the viewDidAppear. You can self.presentViewController and self.dismissViewController from the login view controller. Store a bool key in NSUserDefaults to see if it\'s launching for the first time. In Xcode 7 you can have multiple storyBoards. It will be better if you can keep the Login flow in a separate storyboard. This can be done using SELECT VIEWCONTROLLER > Editor > Refactor to StoryboardAnd here is the Swift version for setting a view as the RootViewContoller- Here\'s my Swifty solution for any future onlookers.1) Create a protocol to handle both login and logout functions:2) Extend said protocol and provide the functionality here for logging out: 3) Then I can conform my AppDelegate to the LoginFlowHandler protocol, and call handleLogin on startup:From here, my protocol extension will handle the logic or determining if the user if logged in/out, and then change the windows rootViewController accordingly!I use this to check for first launch:(if the user deletes the app and re-installs it, it counts like a first launch)In the AppDelegate I check for first launch and create a navigation-controller with the login screens (login and register), which I put on top of the current main window:As this is on top of the regular view controller it\'s independent from the rest of your app and you can just dismiss the view controller, if you don\'t need it anymore. And you can also present the view this way, if the user presses a button manually.BTW: I save the login-data from my users like this:For the logout: I switched away from CoreData (too slow) and use NSArrays and NSDictionaries to manage my data now. Logout just means to empty those arrays and dictionaries. Plus I make sure to set my data in viewWillAppear.That\'s it.I\'m in the same situation as you and the solution I found for cleaning the data is deleting all the CoreData stuff that my view controllers rely on to draw it\'s info. But I still found this approach to be very bad, I think that a more elegant way to do this can be accomplished without storyboards and using only code to manage the transitions between view controllers. I\'ve found this project at Github that does all this stuff only by code and it\'s quite easy to understand. They use a Facebook-like side menu and what they do is change the center view controller depending if the user is logged-in or not. When the user logs out the appDelegate removes the data from CoreData and sets the main view controller to the login screen again.Thanks bhavya\'s solution.There have been two answers about swift, but those are not very intact. I have do that in the swift3.Below is the main code. In AppDelegate.swiftIn SignUpViewController.swiftIn logOutAction functionFirst, never do this in the AppDelegate. This is not its responsibility. Also, never swap out the root view controller on a running app! The first (root) view controller should call somewhere to check login state and present a login view controller if needed.Dismiss this once logged in. Note: You have to present from viewDidAppear in iOS because of the lifecycle. Animate if you wish and you could do some animation transition if you need the whiz bang.Inside the login view controller just dismiss as usual.enter image description hereIn App Delegate.m}view controller.m\nIn view did load}In logout  button action
