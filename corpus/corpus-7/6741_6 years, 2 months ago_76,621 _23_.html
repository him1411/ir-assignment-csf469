I\'m using Git for Xcode 4 project version control.  I\'ve explicitly added ProjectFolder.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/myUserName.xcuserdatad/UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate to .gitignore, but Git it won\'t ignore it.  Any ideas why this is so?Git is probably already tracking the file.From the gitignore docs:To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, use git rm --cached.Use this, replacing [project] and [username] with your info:Alternatively you can use the -a option to git commit that will add all files that have been modified or deleted.Once you\'ve removed the file from git, it will respect your .gitignore.In case that the ignored file kept showing up in the untracked list, you may use git clean -f -d\nto clear things up. git rm --cached YourProjectFolderName.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/yourUserName.xcuserdatad/UserInterfaceState.xcuserstategit commit -m "Removed file that shouldn\'t be tracked"git clean -f -dIn case the file keeps showing up even after doing everything mentioned here, make sure that this checkbox in Xcode settings is unchecked:Had a friend show me this amazing site https://www.gitignore.io/. Enter the IDE of your choice or other options and it will automatically generate a gitignore file consisting of useful ignores, one of which is the xcuserstate. You can preview the gitignore file before downloading.All Answer is great but here is the one will remove for every user if you work in different Mac (Home and office)Just \n    "git clean -f -d"\nworked for me!Here is a very nice explanation of how to remove the files in question recursively from your git history: http://help.github.com/remove-sensitive-data/Very useful, because otherwise tools tend to \'hang\' while trying to show the diff on those huge files that shouldn\'t have been checked in the first place...Here\'s what you can do (in short) to get rid of the largest stuff:Worked very nicely for me :)For xcode 8.3.3 I just checked tried the above code and observe that, now in this casewe have to change the commands to like thisfirst you can create a .gitignore file by using after that you can delete all the userInterface file by using this command and by using this command it will respect your .gitignore file.
