I\'ll use python as an example of what I\'m looking for (you can think of it as pseudocode if you don\'t know Python):I know in ruby I can do :But is this the proper way to determine the type of the object?The proper way to determine the "type" of an object, which is a wobbly term in the Ruby world, is to call object.class.Since classes can inherit from other classes, if you want to determine if an object is "of a particular type" you might call object.is_a?(ClassName) to see if object is of type ClassName or derived from it.Normally type checking is not done in Ruby, but instead objects are assessed based on their ability to respond to particular methods, commonly called "Duck typing". In other words, if it responds to the methods you want, there\'s no reason to be particular about the type.For example, object.is_a?(String) is too rigid. object.respond_to?(:to_s) would be better as it would allow the use of any object that can emit or be converted to a string.you could also try: instance_of?Oftentimes in Ruby, you don\'t actually care what the object\'s class is, per se, you just care that it responds to a certain method. This is known as Duck Typing and you\'ll see it in all sorts of Ruby codebases.So in many (if not most) cases, its best to use Duck Typing using #respond_to?(method):I would say "Yes".\nAs "Matz" had said something like this in one of his talks, \n"Ruby objects have no types." \nNot all of it but the part that he is trying to get across to us. \nWhy would anyone have said \n"Everything is an Object" then? \nTo add he said "Data has Types not objects".So we might enjoy this.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3U1X3z0CEBut Ruby doesn\'t care to much about the type of object just the class. \nWe use classes not types. All data then has a class. They may also have ancestorsThey also have meta classes but I\'ll save you the details on that.Once you know the class then you\'ll be able to lookup what methods you may use for it. That\'s where the "data type" is needed.\nIf you really want to get into details the look up..."The Ruby Object Model"This is the term used for how Ruby handles objects. It\'s all internal so you don\'t really see much of this but it\'s nice to know. But that\'s another topic.Yes! The class is the data type. Objects have classes and data has types. So if you know about data bases then you know there are only a finite set of types.text blocks\nnumbers
