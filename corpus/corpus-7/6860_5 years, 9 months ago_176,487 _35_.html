What are differences betweenandAnd I want to make sure that:and and are the same.Can you tell me what differences and similarities between them?Query 3.0 versionBreaking change: .load(), .unload(), and .error() removedThese methods are shortcuts for event operations, but had several API\n  limitations. The event .load() method conflicted with the ajax .load()\n  method. The .error() method could not be used with window.onerror\n  because of the way the DOM method is defined. If you need to attach\n  events by these names, use the .on() method, e.g. change\n  $("img").load(fn) to $(img).on("load", fn).Should be changed to These are all equivalent:document.ready is a jQuery event, it runs when the DOM is ready, e.g. all elements are there to be found/used, but not necessarily all the content. \nwindow.onload fires later (or at the same time in the worst/failing cases) when images and such are loaded. So, if you\'re using image dimensions for example, you often want to use this instead.Also read a related question:\nDifference between $(window).load() and $(document).ready() functionsFrom the jQuery API DocumentWhile JavaScript provides the load event for executing code when a\n  page is rendered, this event does not get triggered until all assets\n  such as images have been completely received. In most cases, the\n  script can be run as soon as the DOM hierarchy has been fully\n  constructed. The handler passed to .ready() is guaranteed to be\n  executed after the DOM is ready, so this is usually the best place to\n  attach all other event handlers and run other jQuery code. When using\n  scripts that rely on the value of CSS style properties, it\'s important\n  to reference external stylesheets or embed style elements before\n  referencing the scripts.In cases where code relies on loaded assets (for example, if the\n  dimensions of an image are required), the code should be placed in a\n  handler for the load event instead.Answer to the second question -No, they are identical as long as you are not using jQuery in no conflict mode.The ready event occurs after the HTML document has been loaded, while the onload event occurs later, when all content (e.g. images) also has been loaded.The onload event is a standard event in the DOM, while the ready event is specific to jQuery. The purpose of the ready event is that it should occur as early as possible after the document has loaded, so that code that adds functionality to the elements in the page doesn\'t have to wait for all content to load.This three function are the same.andandhere $ is used for define jQuery like $ = jQuery. Now difference is that$(document).ready is jQuery event that is fired when DOM is loaded, so it\xe2\x80\x99s fired when the document structure is ready.$(window).load event is fired after whole content is loaded like page contain images,css etc.The Difference between $(document).ready() and $(window).load() functions is that the code included inside $(window).load() will run once the entire page(images, iframes, stylesheets,etc) are loaded whereas the document ready event fires before all images,iframes etc. are loaded, but after the whole DOM itself is ready.andandThere are not difference between the above 3 codes.They are equivalent,but you may face conflict if any other JavaScript Frameworks uses the same dollar symbol $ as a shortcut name.I think you should look at this article : 6 Different Types of $(document).ready() ExamplesThe ready event is always execute at the only html page is loaded to the browser and the functions are executed....\nBut the load event is executed at the time of all the page contents are loaded to the browser for the page.....\nwe can use $ or jQuery when we use the noconflict() method in jquery scripts...
