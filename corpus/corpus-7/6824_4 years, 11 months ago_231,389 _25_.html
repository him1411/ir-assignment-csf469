In this, this and this thread I tried to find an answer on how to set the margins on a single view. However, I was wondering if there isn\'t an easier way. I\'ll explain why I rather wouldn\'t want to use this approach:I have a custom Button which extends Button. If the background is set to something else than the default background (by calling either setBackgroundResource(int id) or setBackgroundDrawable(Drawable d)), I want the margins to be 0. If I call this:I want the margins to reset to -3dp (I already read here how to convert from pixels to dp, so once I know how to set margins in px, I can manage the conversion myself). But since this is called in the CustomButton class, the parent can vary from LinearLayout to TableLayout, and I\'d rather not have him get his parent and check the instanceof that parent. That\'ll also be quite inperformant, I imagine.Also, when calling (using LayoutParams) parentLayout.addView(myCustomButton, newParams), I don\'t know if this adds it to the correct position (haven\'t tried however), say the middle button of a row of five.Question: Is there any easier way to set the margin of a single Button programmatically besides using LayoutParams?EDIT: I know of the LayoutParams way, but I\'d like a solution that avoids handling each different container type:Because this.getLayoutParams();returns a ViewGroup.LayoutParams, which do not have the attributes topMargin, bottomMargin, leftMargin, rightMargin.\nThe mc instance you see is just a MarginContainer which contains offset (-3dp) margins and (oml, omr, omt, omb) and the original margins (ml, mr, mt, mb).You should use LayoutParams to set your button margins:Depending on what layout you\'re using you should use RelativeLayout.LayoutParams or LinearLayout.LayoutParams.And to convert your dp measure to pixel, try this:LayoutParams - NOT WORKING ! ! !Need use type of: MarginLayoutParamsCode Example for MarginLayoutParams:http://www.codota.com/android/classes/android.view.ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParamsBest way ever:How to call method:Hope this will help you.ThenOrlayout_margin is a constraint that a view child tell to its parent. However it is the parent\'s role to choose whether to allow margin or not. Basically by setting android:layout_margin="10dp", the child is pleading the parent view group to allocate space that is 10dp bigger than its actual size. (padding="10dp", on the other hand, means the child view will make its own content 10dp smaller.)Consequently, not all ViewGroups respect margin. The most notorious example would be listview, where the margins of items are ignored. Before you call setMargin() to a LayoutParam, you should always make sure that the current view is living in a ViewGroup that supports margin (e.g. LinearLayouot or RelativeLayout), and cast the result of getLayoutParams() to the specific LayoutParams you want. (ViewGroup.LayoutParams does not even have setMargins() method!)The function below should do the trick. However make sure you substitute RelativeLayout to the type of the parent view.This method will let you set the Margin in DPUPDATEYou can change the parameter that suits your need.
