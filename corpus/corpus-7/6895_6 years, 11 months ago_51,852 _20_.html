I just deleted the wrong branch with some experimental changes I need with git branch -D branchName.How do I recover the branch?You can use git reflog to find the SHA1 of the last commit of the branch. From that point, you can recreate a branch usingEdit: As @seagullJS says, the branch -D command tells you the sha1, so if you haven\'t closed the terminal yet it becomes real easy. For example this deletes and then immediately restores a branch named master2:If you know the last SHA1 of the branch, you can tryYou can find the SHA1 using git reflog, described in the solution here.If you haven\'t push the deletion yet, you can simply do :If you just deleted the branch, you will see something like this in your terminal:To restore the branch, use:for example:Thanks, this worked. git branch new_branch_name sha1git checkout new_branch_name//can see my old checked in files in my old branchFirst: back up your entire directory, including the .git directory.Second: You can use git fsck --lost-found to obtain the ID of the lost commits.Third: rebase or merge onto the lost commit.Fourth: Always think twice before using -D or --force with git :)You could also read this good discussion of how to recover from this kind of error.EDIT: By the way, don\'t run git gc (or allow it to run by itself - i.e. don\'t run git fetch or anything similar) or you may lose your commits for ever.
