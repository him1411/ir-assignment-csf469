I\'m on Mac, working on Android development from the terminal.  I have successfully created the HelloWorld project and now I\'m trying to run it from the command line in the Android emulator.  Which command runs the emulator for my HelloWorld project?I already have the Android tools and platform-tools in my PATH.Edit:How do I tell the emulator to run my HelloWorld project from the command line?  I\'ve already built the project with ant.I assume that you have built your project and just need to launch it, but you don\'t have any AVDs created and have to use command line for all the actions. You have to do the following.List all your emulators:Run one of the listed emulators:where emulator is under:Just to add here, whenever you get "error: device offline" means that connection with emulator & adb bridge has been broken due to time taken in emulator startup. Rather than re-starting emulator at this point try below two commands which stops & start adb bridge again.adb kill-serveradb start-serverHere you can check the options to execute this command via command-line:For example, I use it like this below: If you are strictly trying to run the emulator from the command line try this in OSX.You can simplify it by adding an alias to the .bash_profile, and sending it to a background job.Let Bash know about the changes.open CMDC:\\adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20140702\\sdk\\tools\n  emulator -avd AdilVDIn here it is explained how you can start the emulator from the terminal.\nThere are many options you can use to personalize your emulator.I hope it helpsOpen command prompt and go to <android-Home>\\sdk\\tools>emulator -avd <AVD_NAME>Here "emulator" is the command used to open your Android Virtual Device.(Linux)\nIn you terminal Copy & Paste and changing the three fields in blueyou can view the emulators in you folder home\ncd /home/Youuser/.android/avd/list of avd name available on .android/avd/SDK_PATH/tools/emulator -netdelay none -netspeed full -avd\n  "AVD_NAME"Nowadays asuming you have Android Studio installed (2.2) in my case and just 1 emulator you might use this one linerIf you do this often, make it easier:Add an alias to ~.aliasesRecall to source ~/.profile ~/.aliases before testing itNext time just  $ androidupIn windows, I use this PowerShell script to start it up.
