This seems to be a bit of an infamous error all over the web. So much so that I have been unable to find an answer to my problem as my scenario doesn\'t fit. An exception gets thrown when I save the image to the stream.Weirdly this works perfectly with a png but gives the above error with jpg and gif which is rather confusing.Most similar problem out there relate to saving images to files without permissions. Ironically the solution is to use a memory stream as I am doing....More detail to the exception. The reason this causes so many issues is the lack of explanation :(OK things I have tried so far. OK I seem to have found the cause just by sheer luck and its nothing wrong with that particular method, it\'s further back up the call stack.Earlier I resize the image and as part of that method I return the resized object as follows. I have inserted two calls to the above method and a direct save to a file.It appears that the memory stream that the object was created on has to be open at the time the object is saved. I am not sure why this is. Is anyone able to enlighten me and how I can get around this. I only return from a stream because after using the resize code similar to this the destination file has an unknown mime type (img.RawFormat.Guid) and Id like the Mime type to be correct on all image objects as it makes it hard write generic handling code otherwise.EDITThis didn\'t come up in my initial search but here\'s the answer from Jon SkeetIf you are getting that error , then I can say that your application doesn\'t have a write permission on some directory.For example, if you are trying to save the Image from the memory stream to the file system , you may get that error.Please if you are using XP, make sure to add write permission for the aspnet account on that folder.If you are using windows server (2003,2008) or Vista, make sure that add write permission for the Network service account.Hope it help some one. I\'ll add this cause of the error as well in hopes it helps some future internet traveler. :)GDI+ limits the maximum height of an image to 65500We do some basic image resizing, but in resizing we try to maintain aspect ratio.  We have a QA guy who\'s a little too good at this job; he decided to test this with a ONE pixel wide photo that was 480 pixels tall.  When the image was scaled to meet our dimensions, the height was north of 68,000 pixels and our app exploded with A generic error occurred in GDI+.You can verify this yourself with test:It\'s too bad there\'s not a friendly .net ArgumentException thrown in the constructor of Bitmap.This article explains in detail what exactly happens: Bitmap and Image constructor dependenciesIn short, for a lifetime of an Image constructed from a stream, the stream must not be destroyed. So, instead oftry thisand close imageStream at the form close or web page close.You\'ll also get this exception if you try to save to an invalid path or if there\'s a permissions issue. If you\'re not 100% sure that the file path is available and permissions are correct then try writing a to a text file. This takes just a few seconds to rule out what would be a very simple fix.And don\'t forget to clean up your file.This is an expansion / qualification of Fred\'s response which stated: "GDI limits the height of an image to 65534". We ran into this issue with one of our .NET applications, and having seen the post, our outsourcing team raised their hands in the air and said they couldn\'t fix the problem without major changes.Based on my testing, it\'s possible to create / manipulate images with a height larger than 65534, but the issue arises when saving to a stream or file IN CERTAIN FORMATS. In the following code, the t.Save() method call throws our friend the generic exception when the pixel height is 65501 for me. For reasons of curiosity, I repeated the test for width, and the same limit applied to saving.The same error also occurs if you write to a memory stream. To get round it, you can repeat the above code and substitute ImageFormat.Tiff or ImageFormat.Bmp for ImageFormat.Jpeg. This runs up to heights / widths of 100,000 for me - I didn\'t test the limits. As it happens .Tiff was a viable option for us.BE WARNEDThe in memory TIFF streams / files consume more memory than their JPG counterparts.I found that if one of the parent folders where I was saving the file had a trailing space then GDI+ would throw the generic exception.In other words, if I tried to save to "C:\\Documents and Settings\\myusername\\Local Settings\\Temp\\ABC DEF M1 Trended Values \\Images\\picture.png" then it threw the generic exception.My folder name was being generated from a file name that happened to have a trailing space so it was easy to .Trim() that and move on.Save image to bitmap variableI also got this error when saving JPEGs, but only for certain images.My final code:I didn\'t create the images so I can\'t tell what the difference is.\nI\'d appreciate if anyone could explain that.This is my SaveJpeg function just FYI:if your code is as follows then also this error occursThe correct one is This may be because we are returning from the using blockHad a very similar problem and also tried cloning the image which doesn\'t work. I found that the best solution was to create a new Bitmap object from the image that was loaded from the memory stream. That way the stream can be disposed of e.g. Hope this helps.SOLVED - I had this exact problem.  The fix, for me, was to up the disk quota for IUSR on the IIS server.  In this instance, we have a catalog app with images of items and such.  The upload quota for the "Anonymous Web User" was set to 100MB, which is the default for this particular hosting company\'s IIS servers.  I upped it to 400MB and was able to upload images without error.This might not be your issue, but if it is, it\'s an easy fix.Just in case if someone is doing as stupid stuff as I was.\n1. make sure path does exist.\n2. make sure you have permissions to write.\n3. make sure your path is correct, in my case I was missing file name in the TargetPath :(it should have said, your path sucks than "A generic error occurred in GDI+"In my case the problem was in the path I was saving (the root C:\\). Changing it to D:\\111\\ made the exception go away.Another cause for this error - the path you indicate in the Save method of the Bitmap instance doesn\'t exist or you haven\'t supplied a full / valid path.Just had this error because I was passing in a filename and not a full path! It happens!My turn!Got it on the .Save... because the using() is holding the file open, so I can\'t overwrite it.  Maybe this will help someone in the future.Error occurring  because of Permission. make sure folder have ALL THE PERMISSION.I notice that your "jpeg" case is actually:Are you sure that the format is jpeg and not something else?I\'d try:Or check what imageToConvert.MimeType() is actually returning.UPDATEIs there any other initialisation you need to do to the MemoryStream object?Just to throw another possible solution on the pile, I\'ll mention the case I ran into with this error message.  The method Bitmap.Save would through this exception when saving an bitmap I had transformed and was displaying.  I discovered it would not throw the exception if the statement had a breakpoint on it, nor would it if the Bitmap.Save was preceeded by Thread.Sleep(500) so I suppose there is some sort of resource contention going on.Simply copying the image to a new Bitmap object was enough to prevent this exception from appearing:If you are trying to save an image to a remote location be sure to add the NETWORK_SERVICE user account into the security settings and give that user read and write permissions. Otherwise it is not going to work.I also get this error because i\'m trying to save images with the same name of previous saved images.Make sure that you don\'t save images with duplicate name.Use for thar for example a \'Random\' function (How does C#'s random number generator work?)\nor for example generate a Guid (http://betterexplained.com/articles/the-quick-guide-to-guids/) For me I was using the Image.Save(Stream, ImageCodecInfo, EncoderParameters) and apparently this was causing the infamous A generic error occurred in GDI+ error.I was trying to use EncoderParameter to save the jpegs in 100% quality. This was working perfectly on "my machine" (doh!) and not on production.When I used the Image.Save(Stream, ImageFormat) instead, the error disappeared! So like an idiot I continued to use the latter although it saves them in default quality which I assume is just 50%.Hope this info helps someone.I encountered the problem too. The problem was due to the loading stream being disposed. But I did not dispose it, it was inside .Net framework. All I had to do was use:instead ofimage_instance is of type System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox!\nPictureBox\'s Load() disposes the stream which the image was loaded from, and I did not know that.Based on the answer from @savindra , if you RHM on your application and try and run as an administrator then it should resolve your problem.  Mine seemed to be a permission issue.
