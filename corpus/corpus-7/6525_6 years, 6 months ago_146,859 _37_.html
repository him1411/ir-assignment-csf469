How do I require all files in a folder in node.js?need something like:When require is given the path of a folder, it\'ll look for an index.js file in that folder; if there is one, it uses that, and if there isn\'t, it fails.It would probably make most sense (if you have control over the folder) to create an index.js file and then assign all the "modules" and then simply require that.yourfile.jsindex.jsIf you don\'t know the filenames you should write some kind of loader.Working example of a loader:I recommend using glob to accomplish that task.Base on @tbranyen\'s solution, I create an index.js file that load arbitrary javascripts under current folder as part of the exports. Then you can require this directory from any where else. Another option is to use the package require-dir which let\'s you do the following. It supports recursion as well. I have a folder /fields full of files with a single class each, ex:Drop this in fields/index.js to export each class:This makes the modules act more like they would in Python:One more option is require-dir-all combining features from most popular packages.Most popular require-dir does not have options to filter the files/dirs and does not have map function (see below), but uses small trick to find module\'s current path.Second by popularity require-all has regexp filtering and preprocessing, but lacks relative path, so you need to use __dirname (this has pros and contras) like: Mentioned here require-index is quite minimalistic.With map you may do some preprocessing, like create objects and pass config values (assuming modules below exports constructors):One module that I have been using for this exact use case is require-all.It recursively requires all files in a given directory and its sub directories as long they don\'t match the excludeDirs property.It also allows specifying a file filter and how to derive the keys of the returned hash from the filenames.I\'m using node modules copy-to module to create a single file to require all the files in our NodeJS-based system.The code for our utility file looks like this:In all of the files, most functions are written as exports, like so:So, then to use any function from a file, you just call:I know this question is 5+ years old, and the given answers are good, but I wanted something a bit more powerful for express, so i created the express-map2 package for npm. I was going to name it simply express-map, however the people at yahoo already have a package with that name, so i had to rename my package.1. basic usage:controller usage:2. advanced usage, with prefixes:As you can see, this saves a ton of time and makes the routing of your application dead simple to write, maintain, and understand. it supports all of the http verbs that express supports, as well as the special .all() method.If you include all files of *.js in directory example ("app/lib/*.js"):example.js:example-2.js:index.js:Can use : https://www.npmjs.com/package/require-file-directory
