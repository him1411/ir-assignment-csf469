In a GCC compiled project,It\'s generally best to do an "out of source" build.  Create your CMakeLists.txt in the root of your project.  Then from the root of your project:And for Debug (again from the root of your project):Debug will add the debug flags appropriate for your compiler.  See\nthis FAQ for more details.You can modify/add to the flags in your CMakeLists.txt via CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG and CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE variables, e.g.: See this link under CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for more details. As for your 3rd question, I\'m not sure what you are asking exactly. CMake should automatically detect and use the compiler appropriate for your different source files.For debug/release flags, see the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE variable (you pass it as cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=value). It takes values like Release, Debug, etc.http://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables#Compilers_and_Toolscmake uses the extension to choose the compiler, so just name your files .c.You can override this with various settings:For example:Would compile .c files with g++. The link above also shows how to select a specific compiler for C/C++.
