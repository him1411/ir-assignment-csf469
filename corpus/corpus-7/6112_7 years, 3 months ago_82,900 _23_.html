I found these things in my regex body but I haven\'t got a clue what I can use them for.\nDoes somebody have examples so I can try to understand how they work?Given the string foobarbarfoo:You can also combine them:Find expression A where expression B follows:Find expression A where expression B does not follow:Find expression A where expression B precedes:Find expression A where expression B does not precede:An atomic group is a non-capturing group that exits the group and throws away all alternatives after the first match of the pattern inside the group, so backtracking is disabled. A non-atomic group will allow backtracking, it will still find the first match, then if the matching ahead fails it will backtrack and find the next match, until a match for the entire expression is found or all possibilities are exhausted.A non-atomic group in the expression (foo|foot)s applied to foots will:An atomic group in the expression (?>foo|foot)s applied to foots will match its 1st alternative foo, then fail as s does not immediately follow, and stop as backtracking is disabled.Lookarounds are zero width assertions. They check for a regex (towards right or left of the current position - based on ahead or behind), succeeds or fails when a match is found (based on if it is positive or negative) and discards the matched portion. They don\'t consume any character - the matching for regex following them (if any), will start at the same cursor position. Read regular-expression.info for more details.Syntax:Match only if REGEX_1 matches; after matching REGEX_1, the match is discarded and searching for REGEX_2 starts at the same position.example:REGEX_1 is [a-z0-9]{4}$ which matches four alphanumeric chars followed by end of line.\nREGEX_2 is [a-z]{1,2}[0-9]{2,3} which matches one or two letters followed by two or three digits.REGEX_1 makes sure that the length of string is indeed 4, but doesn\'t consume any characters so that search for REGEX_2 starts at the same location. Now REGEX_2 makes sure that the string matches some other rules. Without look-ahead it would match strings of length three or five.Syntax:Match only if REGEX_1 does not match; after checking REGEX_1, the search for REGEX_2 starts at the same position.example:The look-ahead part checks for the FWORD in the string and fails if it finds it. If it doesn\'t find FWORD, the look-ahead succeeds and the following part verifies that the string\'s length is between 10 and 30 and that it contains only word characters a-zA-Z0-9_Look-behind is similar to look-ahead: it just looks behind the current cursor position. Some regex flavors like javascript doesn\'t support look-behind assertions. And most flavors that support it (PHP, Python etc) require that look-behind portion to have a fixed length.
