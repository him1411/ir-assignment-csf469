I am new to WAMP and I have just installed it today.The setup went well and localhost seems to work, but when I try to access phpMyAdmin I get this error:Forbidden\n  You don\'t have permission to access /phpmyadmin/ on this server.Why do I get this permission access error with phpMyAdmin? I am using Windows 7.Change the file content of c:\\wamp\\alias\\phpmyadmin.conf to the following.Note: You should set the Allow Directive to allow from your local machine for security purposes. The directive Allow from all is insecure and should be limited to your local machine.Here my WAMP installation is in the c:\\wamp folder. Change it according to your installation.Previously, it was like this:Modern versions of Apache 2.2 and up will look for a IPv6 loopback instead of a IPv4 loopback (your localhost). The real problem is that wamp is binding to an IPv6 address. The fix:\n  just add Allow from ::1 - Tiberiu-Ionu\xc8\x9b StanThis will allow only the local machine to access local apps for Apache.Restart your Apache server after making these changes.You have to just check whether your WAMP server is online or not.To put your WAMP server online, follow these steps.And you are DONE...If you\'re using WAMP with Apache 2.4.2 or greater, you need to use Require all instead of Allow and remove Order Deny,Allow:*as stated in this blog postJust use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost (no changes to the configuration file are required).System:This works:This one fails:I just had the same problem. It turns out that my installation of Windows is using the IPv6 address ::1 instead of 127.0.0.1. To solve this, I opened httpd.conf and changed the following line:to:Now I can access the server through localhost. Whatever you do, don\'t remove the Deny from all from the line above, or anyone on your network can gain access to your web server (unless that\'s what you want of course).If you are on Windows 7 or 8 then Apache might be seeing the connections coming from "::1" which is the IPv6 equivalent of 127.0.0.1.You can check this by looking in the Apache Access Log (reachable from the WAMP menu)The ::1 at the start is the clients address. The 403 at the end is the Access Denied code.The answers above will remove all restrictions and open phpmyadmin to all, but if you still want to restrict phpmyadmin to your machine only (generally a good idea) then under the line.....add the following:(edit: Added suggestion from Nukeface)Change to in your httpd.conf file. It will bind Apache to a specific IP address and port.I found that using localhost would not work properly to allow local access from the server.  I had to use 127.0.0.1.In phpmyadmin.conf this did not work:this did work:I am using WampServer Version 2.2For Apache 2.4.2:In httpd.conf:ChangetoI wanted to run my server online and not under localhost / 127.0.0.1 and had the forbidden message. I am running the WAMP 2.2 server (Apache 2.4.2 / PHP 5.4.3 / MySQL 5.5.24) on Windows 7 64 bit. What worked for me is the following:Again, it worked for me and from this thread I understand that there are many cases in which you may get the above error message so if mine does not work, try other solutions.Good luck.(I hope it helps someone like it helped me. I did not find any one of the solutions above working for me.)1.change D:\\wamp\\bin\\apache\\apache2.4.9\\conf\\httpd.conf near line 2792.change like this in D:\\wamp\\alias\\phpmyadmin.conf from existing one3.Click to Restart All services in wamp.4.Click put online in wamp.5.Again Click to Restart All services in wamp.Hope it Helps..I fixed that problem before. It can happen due to many reasons, so you can use some or all of the next steps (opening mentioned files using any text editor, like Notepad++).If you install WAMP in C:\\wamp 1- Open file C:\\wamp\\bin\\apache\\apache2.2.22\\conf\\httpd.confNote: you may have a different Apache version than Apache 2.2.22, so you need to write it instead.Search for: Directory "C:/wamp/www/". You will find something similar to this:Be sure that Allow from all is exists and not outcommented.2- Open file C:\\wamp\\alias\\phpmyadmin.conf.Make sure that Change Allow from 127.0.0.1 to Allow from all.You can remove Deny from all or comment it out by adding # at the beginning of the line, but you have to make sure that Allow from all is the last line of code just before </Directory>.Note: you may have a different version than phpMyAdmin 3.5.1.To use localhost/phpmyadmin instead of 127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin:Open file C:\\wamp\\bin\\apache\\apache2.2.22\\conf\\extra\\httpd-vhosts.conf. Add the following at the end of it.The simple solution to this would be to find phpmyadmin.conf file and then find below code inside it,Change "Deny from all" to "Allow from all". OR Follow below link to get better understanding on how to do it,WAMP says Forbidden You don\'t have permission to access /phpmyadmin/ on this server Windows 7 or 8Enjoy :)For Apache 2.4.2 the solution is: \nin httpd.conf on line 265 change Require none to Require all granted.\nThat\'s all.I had commented out the ::1 line in my hosts file.Even I faced the same issue with my domain. If I gave an IP address it was working. But with a domain name it was not.Then I checked my DNS A record. The domain had multiple entries with different IP addresses assigned. I removed all the wrong values, and it worked. Just one more check list if anyone faces a similar issue.Just edit the file "c:\\wamp\\alias\\phpmyadmin.conf"like thisIn my case, the problem was that the phpMyAdmin version was specified wrongly in the phpmyadmin.conf file. You may check that: Go to wamp/apps/phpmyadmin3.x.x: notice the file name - what version you are currently using? Open file wamp/alias/phpmyadmin.conf: \n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n    AllowOverride all\n        Order Deny,Allow\n        Allow from all\nCheck the first line (directory "c:/wamp/apps/phpmyadmin3.x.x/") is the file name exactly the same as your actual file name.Make sure the directory file name is absolutely correct.What was going on with my setup was that WAMP was binding to an IPv6 Address (and every subsequent time I reinstalled WAMP). To fix this, I went into c:\\wamp\\alias\\phpmyadmin.conf and added the line Allow from ::1The reason might be 127.0.0.1 is not linked to localhost. Check your \'C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\' file. It should have a line like this:# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.\n127.0.0.1       localhostI tried to set up my password... And that\'s how I got locked out from localhost. They should fix this...Anyway, be careful with random advice. They all may or may not work. But some advice will lock you out even further. The one that worked for me:Type "http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin/" in the address bar. Then I discovered that http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ also works. However, before that, out of desperation I had... I deleted the files, I uninstalled WAMP, deleted temporary cookies, and installed WAMP again. It still doesn\'t accept "localhost" (and I am tired after a day trying to access WAMP), but the 127.0.0.1 and the localhost/phpmy... work. I am happy to see the page back. And start working again.If you read this thread all the way to here means you are probably in a big problem... Windows 8, WAMP (wampserver 2.2). I wonder what it needs to get back access to localhost. In my case a WAMP server was installed before on my pc, so when installing the new one some files not overwritten, all you have to do in that case is to go to the C:\\ and delete the whole WAMP folder then install it again.Check if you are logged in as root or user with privileges. Just to be sure, logout and login again with root/no-password.If your WAMP icon is not green try:\nLeft Click WAMP Icon > MySQL > Services > Install ServiceSo all of these answers are basically the same one. They only address one idea: it has to be DNS related. Well, that is not the only part of this it turns out. After many changes, I was getting nowhere reading the next "same answer" hoping that it would just go my way.What did the trick for me was to adjust my versions of Apache. I think what the deal was, is that the one of the configuration files get a path off or that the install due to IIS may have been messed up / or / or /etc. And so forcing a version change readdresses everything from your firewall to bad configurations.  In fact, when I switched back to Apache 2.4.2 it goes back to being a forbidden. And as soon as I go back to Apache 2.4.4 it comes back up. That rules out local network issues.  I just wanted to point out that all of the answers here are the same and that I have been able to kill the forbidden by changing the Apache version.I had the same problem. The hosts file is corrupted!\nthere were:The result is that localhost is not defined.Solution: edit the hosts file with admin rights and correct to only one entry:In the newest version of WAMP I somehow had a "deny all" in my .htaccess file. If nothing else works, please check there too.you can access through http://127.0.0.1:PortNumber/if you don\'t want to change config filesIn my case, using Wampserver 3 64bit version 3.0.0, the path to the phpmyadmin4.5.2 directory in the phpmyadmin.conf file was wrong. For some reason the apps directory is inside the scripts directory. So I entered the correct paths as shown below. Then you probably need to restart Apache and reload the page.I changed:To:replace localhost with 127.0.0.1 in your URL, worked for me.
