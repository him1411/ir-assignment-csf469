And for extra credit - Is it possible to find the origins of conflicting DNS records?You\'ll want the SOA (Start of Authority) record for a given domain name, and this is how you accomplish it using the universally available nslookup command line tool:The origin (or primary name server on Windows) line tells you that ns51.domaincontrol is the main name server for stackoverflow.com.At the end of output all authoritative servers, including backup servers for the given domain, are listed.You used the singular in your question but there are typically several authoritative name servers, the RFC 1034 recommends at least two.Unless you mean "primary name server" and not "authoritative name server". The secondary name servers are authoritative.To find out the name servers of a domain on  Unix:To find out the server listed as primary (the notion of "primary" is quite fuzzy these days and typically has no good answer):To check discrepencies between name servers, my preference goes to the old check_soa tool, described in Liu & Albitz "DNS & BIND" book (O\'Reilly editor). The source code is available in http://examples.oreilly.com/dns5/Here, the two authoritative name servers have the same serial number. Good.On *nix:I have a DNS propagation tool designed to answer these kind of questions.Source is released under the AGPLv3.(Yes, the interface is rather basic at the moment :) )You could also find out the nameservers for a domain with the "host" command:The term you should be googling is "authoritative," not "definitive".On Linux or Mac you can use the commands whois, dig, host, nslookup or several others. nslookup might also work on Windows.An example:As for the extra credit: Yes, it is possible.aryeh is definitely wrong, as his suggestion usually will only give you the IP address for the hostname. If you use dig, you have to look for NS records, like so:Keep in mind that this may ask your local DNS server and thus may give wrong or out-of-date answers that it has in its cache.We\'ve built a dns lookup tool that gives you the domain\'s authoritative nameservers and its common dns records in one request.Example: https://www.misk.com/tools/#dns/stackoverflow.comOur tool finds the authoritative nameservers by performing a realtime (uncached) dns lookup at the root nameservers and then following the nameserver referrals until we reach the authoritative nameservers. This is the same logic that dns resolvers use to obtain authoritative answers. A random authoritative nameserver is selected (and identified) on each query allowing you to find conflicting dns records by performing multiple requests.You can also view the nameserver delegation path by clicking on "Authoritative Nameservers" at the bottom of the dns lookup results from the example above.Example: https://www.misk.com/tools/#dns/stackoverflow.com@f.root-servers.netYou can use the whois service. On a UNIX like operating system you would execute the following command. Alternatively you can do it on the web at http://www.internic.net/whois.html.whois stackoverflow.comYou would get the following response....text removed here...Domain servers in listed order:\nNS51.DOMAINCONTROL.COM\nNS52.DOMAINCONTROL.COMYou can use nslookup or dig to find out more information about records for a given domain. This might help you resolve the conflicts you have described.I found that the best way it to add always the +trace option:It works also with recursive CNAME hosted in different provider. +trace trace imply +norecurse so the result is just for the domain you specify.Unfortunately, most of these tools only return the NS record as provided by the actual name server itself. To be more accurate in determining which name servers are actually responsible for a domain, you\'d have to either use "whois" and check the domains listed there OR use "dig [domain] NS @[root name server]" and run that recursively until you get the name server listings...I wish there were a simple command line that you could run to get THAT result dependably and in a consistent format, not just the result that is given from the name server itself. The purpose of this for me is to be able to query about 330 domain names that I manage so I can determine exactly which name server each domain is pointing to (as per their registrar settings).Anyone know of a command using "dig" or "host" or something else on *nix?An easy way is to use an online domain tool. My favorite is Domain Tools (formerly whois.sc). I\'m not sure if they can resolve conflicting DNS records though. As an example, the DNS servers for stackoverflow.com are
