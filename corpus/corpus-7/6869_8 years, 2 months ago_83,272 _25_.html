In a nutshell, I\'m searching for a working autocompletion feature for the Vim editor. I\'ve argued before that Vim completely replaces an IDE under Linux and while that\'s certainly true, it lacks one important feature: autocompletion.I know about Ctrl+N, Exuberant Ctags integration, Taglist, cppcomplete and OmniCppComplete. Alas, none of these fits my description of \xe2\x80\x9cworking autocompletion:\xe2\x80\x9dI\'m aware of the fact that not even modern, full-blown IDEs offer good C++ code completion. That\'s why I\'ve accepted Vim\'s lack in this area until now. But I think a fundamental level of code completion isn\'t too much to ask, and is in fact required for productive usage. So I\'m searching for something that can accomplish at least the following things.Syntax awareness. cppcomplete promises (but doesn\'t deliver for me), correct, scope-aware auto-completion of the following:And really, anything else is completely useless.Configurability. I need to specify (easily) where the source files are, and hence where the script gets its auto-completion information from. In fact, I\'ve got a Makefile in my directory which specifies the required include paths. Eclipse can interpret the information found therein, why not a Vim script as well?Up-to-dateness. As soon as I change something in my file, I want the auto-completion to reflect this. I do not want to manually trigger ctags (or something comparable). Also, changes should be incremental, i.e. when I\'ve changed just one file it\'s completely unacceptable for ctags to re-parse the whole directory tree (which may be huge).Did I forget anything? Feel free to update.I\'m comfortable with quite a lot of configuration and/or tinkering but I don\'t want to program a solution from scratch, and I\'m not good at debugging Vim scripts.A final note, I\'d really like something similar for Java and C# but I guess that\'s too much to hope for: ctags only parses code files and both Java and C# have huge, precompiled frameworks that would need to be indexed. Unfortunately, developing .NET without an IDE is even more of a PITA than C++.Try YouCompleteMe. It uses Clang through the libclang interface, offering semantic C/C++/Objective-C completion. It\'s much like clang_complete, but substantially faster and with fuzzy-matching.In addition to the above, YCM also provides semantic completion for C#, Python, Go, TypeScript etc. It also provides non-semantic, identifier-based completion for languages for which it doesn\'t have semantic support.There\xe2\x80\x99s also clang_complete which uses the clang compiler to provide code completion for C++ projects. There\xe2\x80\x99s another question with troubleshooting hints for this plugin.The plugin seems to work fairly well as long as the project compiles, but is prohibitively slow for large projects (since it attempts a full compilation to generate the tags list).as per requested, here is the comment I gave earlier:have a look at this:this link should help you if you want to use monodevelop on a MacOSXGood luck and happy coding.I\'ve just found the project Eclim linked in another question. This looks quite promising, at least for Java integration.I\'m a bit late to the party but autocomplpop might be helpful.is what you are looking for something like intellisense?insevim seems to address the issue.link to screenshots hereDid someone mention code_complete?But you did not like ctags, so this is probably not what you are looking for...
