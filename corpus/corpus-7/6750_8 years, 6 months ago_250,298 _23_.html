What is the correct (modern) method for tapping into the window resize event that works in Firefox, WebKit, and Internet Explorer?And can you turn both scrollbars on/off?jQuery has a built-in method for this:For the sake of UI responsiveness, you might consider using a setTimeout to call your code only after some number of milliseconds, as shown in the following example, inspired by this:Here is the non-jQuery way of tapping into the resize event:It works on all modern browsers. It does not throttle anything for you. Here is an example of it in action. Sorry to bring up an old thread, but if someone doesn\'t want to use jQuery you can use this:Since you are open to jQuery, this plugin seems to do the trick.Using jQuery 1.9.1 I just found out that, although technically identical, this did not work in IE10 (but in Firefox):while this worked in both browsers:jQuery provides $(window).resize() function by default:I consider the jQuery plugin "jQuery resize event" to be the best solution for this as it takes care of throttling the event so that it works the same across all browsers. It\'s similar to Andrews answer but better since you can hook the resize event to specific elements/selectors as well as the entire window. It opens up new possibilities to write clean code.The plugin is available hereThere are performance issues if you add a lot of listeners, but for most usage cases it\'s perfect.I think you should add further control to this:hope it will help in jQuerydefine a function first, if there is an existing function skip to next step. browser resize use like these.Besides the window resize functions mentioned it is important to understand that the resize events fire a lot if used without a deboucing the events.    Paul Irish has an excellent function that debounces the resize calls a great deal. Very recommended to use. Works cross-browser. Tested it in IE8 the other day and all was fine.http://www.paulirish.com/2009/throttled-smartresize-jquery-event-handler/Make sure to check out the demo to see the difference.Here is the function for completeness.
