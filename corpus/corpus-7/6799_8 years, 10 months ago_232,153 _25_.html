We need to see what methods/fields an object has in Javascript.As the others said, you can use Firebug, and that will sort you out no worries on Firefox. Chrome & Safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to Firebug\'s console, so your code should be portable across those browsers. For other browsers, there\'s Firebug Lite.If Firebug isn\'t an option for you, then try this simple script:I\'d recommend against alerting each individual property: some objects have a LOT of properties and you\'ll be there all day clicking "OK", "OK", "OK", "O... dammit that was the property I was looking for".If you are using firefox then the firebug plug-in console is an excellent way of examining objectsAlternatively you can loop through the properties (including methods) like this:A lot of modern browsers support the following syntax:It can\'t be stated enough that you can use console.debug(object) for this. This technique will save you literally hundreds of hours a year if you do this for a living :pTo answer the question from the context of the title of this question, here is a function that does something similar to a PHP var_dump.  It only dumps one variable per call, but it indicates the data type as well as the value and it iterates through array\'s and objects [even if they are Arrays of Objects and vice versa].  I\'m sure this can be improved on.  I\'m more of a PHP guy.console.dir (toward the bottom of the linked page) in either firebug or the google-chrome web-inspector will output an interactive listing of an object\'s properties. See also this Stack-O answerIf you use Firebug, you can use console.log to output an object and get a hyperlinked, explorable item in the console.A bit of improvement on nickf\'s function for those that don\'t know the type of the variable coming in:I improved nickf\'s answer, so it recursively loops through objects:If you are looking for PHP function converted in JS, there is this little site: http://phpjs.org.\nOn there you can get most of the PHP function reliably written in JS. for var_dump try: http://phpjs.org/functions/var_dump/ (make sure to check the top comment, this depends on "echo", which can also be downloaded from the same site)These Should work correctly On Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox (if you are running with old version of firefox, so you have to install Firebug plugin)\nOn Internet Explorer 8 or higher you must do as follow: For more informations you can visit this URL: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-apiYou want to see the entire object (all nested levels of objects and variables inside it) in JSON form. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and printing out a JSON string of your object is a good equivalent of var_dump (to get a string representation of a JavaScript object). Fortunately, JSON is very easy to use in code, and the JSON data format is also pretty human-readable.Example:I used the first answer, but I felt was missing a recursion in it.The result was this:Based on previous functions found in this post.\nAdded recursive mode and indentation.ExampleResultThe following is my favorite var_dump/print_r equivalent in Javascript to PHPs var_dump.
