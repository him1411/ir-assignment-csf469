I have a string that I want to hash. What\'s the easiest way to generate the hash in node.js?The hash is for versioning, not security.Thanks.Take a look at crypto.createHash(algorithm)If you just want to md5 hash a simple string I found this works for me.bada-bingNode\'s crypto module API is still unstable.As of version 4.0.0, the native Crypto module is not unstable anymore. From the official documentation:Stability: 2 - StableThe API has proven satisfactory. Compatibility with the npm ecosystem\n  is a high priority, and will not be broken unless absolutely necessary.So, it should be considered safe to use the native implementation, without external dependencies.For reference, the modules mentioned bellow were suggested as alternative solutions when the Crypto module was still unstable.You could also use one of the modules sha1 or md5 which both do the job.and thenorand then(MD5 is insecure but often used by services like Gravatar.)The API of these modules won\'t change!Simple function :And :Here you can benchmark all supported hashes on your hardware, supported by your version of node.js. Some are cryptographic, and some is just for a checksum. Its calculating "Hello World" 1 million times for each algorithm. It may take around 1-15 seconds for each algorithm (Tested on the Standard Google Computing Engine with Node.js 4.2.2).Result:\nDSA: 1992ms\nDSA-SHA: 1960ms\nDSA-SHA1: 2062ms\nDSA-SHA1-old: 2124ms\nRSA-MD4: 1893ms\nRSA-MD5: 1982ms\nRSA-MDC2: 2797ms\nRSA-RIPEMD160: 2101ms\nRSA-SHA: 1948ms\nRSA-SHA1: 1908ms\nRSA-SHA1-2: 2042ms\nRSA-SHA224: 2176ms\nRSA-SHA256: 2158ms\nRSA-SHA384: 2290ms\nRSA-SHA512: 2357ms\ndsaEncryption: 1936ms\ndsaWithSHA: 1910ms\ndsaWithSHA1: 1926ms\ndss1: 1928ms\necdsa-with-SHA1: 1880ms\nmd4: 1833ms\nmd4WithRSAEncryption: 1925ms\nmd5: 1863ms\nmd5WithRSAEncryption: 1923ms\nmdc2: 2729ms\nmdc2WithRSA: 2890ms\nripemd: 2101ms\nripemd160: 2153ms\nripemd160WithRSA: 2210ms\nrmd160: 2146ms\nsha: 1929ms\nsha1: 1880ms\nsha1WithRSAEncryption: 1957ms\nsha224: 2121ms\nsha224WithRSAEncryption: 2290ms\nsha256: 2134ms\nsha256WithRSAEncryption: 2190ms\nsha384: 2181ms\nsha384WithRSAEncryption: 2343ms\nsha512: 2371ms\nsha512WithRSAEncryption: 2434ms\nshaWithRSAEncryption: 1966ms\nssl2-md5: 1853ms\nssl3-md5: 1868ms\nssl3-sha1: 1971ms\nwhirlpool: 2578msThe crypto module makes this very easy. Setup: Usage: Considering the thoughts from\nhttp://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/the-cryptographic-doom-principle/\n(in short: FIRST encrypt, THEN authenticate. Afterwards FIRST verify, THEN decrypt)\nI have implemented the following solution in node.js:It can be tested with:Hope this helps :-)I use blueimp-md5 which is "Compatible with server-side environments like Node.js, module loaders like RequireJS, Browserify or webpack and all web browsers."Use it like this:If passing hashed values around in the open it\'s always a good idea to salt them so that it is harder for people to recreate them:
