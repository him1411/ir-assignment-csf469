Using PHP, what\'s the fastest way to convert a string like this: "123" to an integer?Why is that particular method the fastest? What happens if it gets unexpected input, such as "hello" or an array?I\'ve just set up a quick benchmarking exercise:On average, calling intval() is two and a half times slower, and the difference is the greatest if your input already is an integer.I\'d be interested to know why though.Update: I\'ve run the tests again, this time with coercion (0 + $var)Addendum: I\'ve just come across a slightly unexpected behaviour which you should be aware of when choosing one of these methods:Tested using PHP 5.3.1I personally feel casting is the prettiest.Should a string like \'Hello\' be sent, it will be cast to integer 0. For a string such as \'22 years old\', it will be cast to integer 22. Anything it can\'t parse to a number becomes 0.If you really do NEED the speed, I guess the other suggestions here are correct in assuming that coercion is the fastest.Run a test. This was a test that ran each scenario 10,000,000 times. :-)Co-ercion is 0 + "123"Casting is (integer)"123"I think Co-ercion is a tiny bit faster. Oh, and trying 0 + array(\'123\') is a fatal error in PHP. You might want your code to check the type of the supplied value.My test code is below.You can simply convert long string into integer by using FLOAT$float = (float)$num; Or if you want integer not floating val then go with$float = (int)$num; For ex.integer excract from any string$in = \'tel.123-12-33\';//$out =\'1231233\';More ad-hoc benchmark results:Ran a benchmark, and it turns out the fastest way of getting a real integer (using all the available methods) isJust using returns a float.
