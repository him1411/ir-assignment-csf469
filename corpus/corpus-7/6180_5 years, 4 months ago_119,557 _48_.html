I\'ve taken some shared code and put it in an NPM module, one I don\'t want to upload to the central registry. The question is, how do I install it from other projects?The obvious way is probably to set up my own NPM registry, but according to the documentation, that involves a lot of hassle.Can I just install an NPM module that sits on the local filesystem, or perhaps even from git?or somedir must contain the package.json inside it.It knows about git too:In your private npm modules add to your package.jsonThen to reference the private module in another module, use this in your package.jsonCan I just install an NPM package that sits on the local filesystem, or perhaps even from git?Yes you can! From the docs https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/installA package is:Isn\'t npm brilliant?Update January 2016In addition to other answers, there is sometimes the scenario where you wish to have private modules available in a team context. Both Github and Bitbucket support the concept of generating a team API Key. This API key can be used as the password to perform API requests as this team.In your private npm modules add to your package.jsonThen to reference the private module in another module, use this in your package.jsonwhere team name = myteamname, and API Key = aQqtcplwFzlumj0mIDdRGCbsAq5d6Xg4Here I reference a bitbucket repo, but it is almost identical using github too.Finally, as an alternative, if you really don\'t mind paying $7 per month (as of writing) then you can now have private NPM modules out of the box.FWIW: I had problems with all of these answers when dealing with a private organization repository.The following worked for me:For example:I\'m not entirely sure why the other answers didn\'t work for me in this one case, because they\'re what I tried first before I hit Google and found this answer. And the other answers are what I\'ve done in the past.Hopefully this helps someone else.I had this same problem, and after some searching around, I found Reggie (https://github.com/mbrevoort/node-reggie). It looks pretty solid. It allows for lightweight publishing of NPM modules to private servers. Not perfect (no authentication upon installation), and it\'s still really young, but I tested it locally, and it seems to do what it says it should do. That is...  (and this just from their docs)then cd into your module directory and...finally, you can install packages from reggie just by using that url either in a direct npm install command, or from within a package.json... like soor.. Structure your code in an accessible fashion like below. If this is possible for you.NodeProjs\\Apps\\MainApp\\package.jsonNodeProjs\\Modules\\DataModule\\package.jsonWithin MainApp @ NodProjs\\Apps\\MainApp\\You may need to update package.json as:This worked for my situation.Npm now provides unlimited private hosted modules for $7/user/month used like soin your package json set  "name": " @username/private-project"then to require your project:Config to install from public Github repository, even if machine is under firewall:Starting with arcseldon\'s answer, I found that the team name was needed in the URL like so:And note that the API key is only available for the team, not individual users.I use the following with a private github repository:Very simple -It actually sets registry = "https://path-to-your-registry" this line to /Users/<ur-machine-user-name>/.npmrcAll the value you have set explicitly or have been set by default can be seen by - npm config list
