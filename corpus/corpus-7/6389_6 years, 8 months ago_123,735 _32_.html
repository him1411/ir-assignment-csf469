I\'m trying to use IIS Express with VS2010 to host a silverlight application.  I modified my applicationhost.config file to allow for modification of the proper configuration settings.  I have the following in my web.config:I am not being authenticated and my domain service call returns a null record as the user.  I was able to get this to work after installing VS2010 SP1 BETA but I\'m trying to get this to work with only IIS Express.How do I enable Windows Authentication to work with IIS Express.  Is there a configuration setting that I am missing?option-1:edit \\My Documents\\IISExpress\\config\\applicationhost.config file and enable windowsAuthentication, i.e:option-2:Unlock windowsAuthentication section in \\My Documents\\IISExpress\\config\\applicationhost.config as followsAlter override settings for the required authentication types to \'Allow\'Add following in the application\'s web.configBelow link may help:\nhttp://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/376/delegating-configuration-to-webconfig-files/After installing VS 2010 SP1 applying option 1 + 2 may be required to get windows authentication working. In addition, you may need to set anonymous authentication to false in IIS Express applicationhost.config:for VS2015, the IIS Express applicationhost config file may be located here:and the <UseGlobalApplicationHostFile> option in the project file selects the default or solution-specific config file.Visual Studio 2010 SP1 and 2012 added support for IIS Express eliminating the need to edit angle brackets.I believe this solution is superior to the vikomall\'s options.
