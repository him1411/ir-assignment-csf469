Something wrong is going on with one of the files in my local git repository. When I\'m trying to change the branch it says:What could that mean?This could mean that another program is using the file, which is preventing git from "moving" the file into or out of the working directory when you are attempting to change branches. I have had this happen on Windows Vista where eclipse is the program "using" the file. The file may not be actually open in eclipse but may have been opened by a process run by eclipse. In this event, try closing the file in any applications that might have used it. If that doesn\'t work, completely exit any applications which may have opened the file.  I had this issue and solved it by the command : git gc\nThe above command remove temp and unnecessary files. (Garbage collector.)this solution from here worked for me:This is a Windows specific answer, so I\'m aware that it\'s not relevant to you... I\'m just including it for the benefit of future searchers.In my case, it was because I was running Git from a non-elevated command line. "Run as Administrator" fixed it for me.I encountered this issue while doing a git pull.I tried git gc and it resolved my problem.In my case there are no processes touching the file or directory. Maybe it happens if the path is very long, because an operating system restriction (windows). Try enabling the longpath support flag in the global git configuration as indicated below:or try to setting the yes/no answer flag if it is not conflictive for youIf the path is too long, I\'ve not found a successful solution.I faced same issue while doing \'git pull\'. I tried manual housekeeping git command \'git gc\' and it resolved my problem.In my case (Win8.1, TortoiseGit running), it was the process called "TortoiseSVN status cache" that was locking the file.Killing it allowed me to run "git gc" without any more problems.\nThe above process is fired up by TortoiseGit, so there is no need to manually restart it.I got this problem in Windows. I closed my IDE (Android Studio) and selected YES in git shell. It worked.I had this kind of issue on Windows 7 and it turned out to be due to some orphaned git.exe process.To solve it, open Task Manager and kill all git.exe processes.Since git commands are short-lived, you should normally never see any git.exe in Task Manager. When they are there, it usually means something is wrong, and you should kill those processes.On Windows 8:\nI ran git gc and it said git gc was already running, I ran git gc --force and the garbage collector ran.I could then switch branches and merge without any issues, try git gc --force.Perhaps the gc process didn\'t stop gracefully for one reason or another.I had this issue with .tmp files in /.git/objects/pack folder. I think something had failed during a push or pull, so I removed these temporary files and reset the HEAD to my last commit. Not sure if this is advised but it worked for me. Also git count-objects -v gave me a list of the .tmp files that didn\'t belong in the pack folder.Or to suppress the y/n messages in windows git open cmd.exe and run:seen here: https://twitter.com/petercamfield/status/494805475733807104I ran into this issue running git Bash and Eclipse EGit at the same time.\nSolution: close Eclipse. Also wouldn\'t hurt to run git gc as @khilo mentioned.After trying various solutions finally git clean -f helped me.EDIT: I hit the problem again few times - closing all processes dependent on git seems to help (like gitbash, Eclipse IDE, etc.)This is a Windows specific answer, so I\'m aware that it\'s not relevant to you...

"Run as Administrator" fixed it for me.Thanks a lotThis may be a separate gitk window running to see some git history.Just close that window to fix that problem.After none of the above answers seemed to work, running git fetch -p did the job for me.https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetchI ran into this issue in Windows, you might want to run the git bash as an administrator and then perform the desire commands, that solved the issue for me.As stated above, something else is holding the files. Thing is that program doesnt look suspicious for us. \nI was trying to do a git pull from console, while having GitKraken opened. Closing GitKraken fixed the problem.Try to restart you Apache or other web server as it may have locked some of your files.
