I am interested what is C# analog of C++ std::pair? I have found System.Web.UI.Pair class, but wanted something template based.Thank you!Tuples are available since .NET4.0 and support generics:In previous versions you can use System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair<K, V> or a solution like the following:And use it like this:This outputs:Or even this chained pairs:That outputs:System.Web.UI contained the Pair class because it was used heavily in ASP.NET 1.1 as an internal ViewState structure.Update Aug 2017: C# 7.0 / .NET Framework 4.7 provides a syntax to declare a Tuple with named items using the System.ValueTuple struct.see MSDN for more syntax examples. Update Jun 2012: Tuples have been a part of .NET since version 4.0.Here is an earlier article describing inclusion in.NET4.0 and support for generics:Unfortunately, there is none. You can use the System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair<K, V> in many situations.Alternatively, you can use anonymous types to handle tuples, at least locally:The last alternative is to create an own class.C# has tuples as of version 4.0.Some answers seem just wrong, Here is my pair classHere is some test code:If it\'s about dictionaries and the like, you\'re looking for System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>.Depending on what you want to accomplish, you might want to try out KeyValuePair. The fact that you cannot change the key of an entry can of course be rectified by simply replacing the entire entry by a new instance of KeyValuePair.I created a C# implementation of Tuples, which solves the problem generically for between two and five values - here\'s the blog post, which contains a link to the source.I was asking the same question just now after a quick google I found that There is a pair class in .NET except its in the System.Web.UI  ^ ~ ^ (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.pair.aspx)\ngoodness knows why they put it there instead of the collections frameworkSince .NET 4.0 you have System.Tuple<T1, T2> class:I typically extend the Tuple class into my own generic wrapper as follows:and use it like so:On order to get the above to work (I needed a pair as the key of a dictionary). I had to add:and once I did that I also addedto suppress a compiler warning.The PowerCollections library (formerly available from Wintellect but now hosted on Codeplex @ http://powercollections.codeplex.com) has a generic Pair structure.Apart from custom class or .Net 4.0 Tuples, since C# 7.0 there is a new feature called ValueTuple, which is a struct that can be used in this case. Instead of writing:and access values through t.Item1 and t.Item2, you can simply do it like that:or even:You can find much more examples (including object deconstruction into tuple) of this in Stack Overflow documentation for C#7.0
