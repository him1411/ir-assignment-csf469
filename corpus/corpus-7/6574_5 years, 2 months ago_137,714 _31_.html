I\'ve mucked up my migrations, I used IgnoreChanges on the initial migration, but now I want to delete all my migrations and start with an initial migration with all of the logic.When I delete the migrations in the folder and try and Add-Migration it doesn\'t generate a full file (it\'s empty - because I haven\'t made any changes since my last, but now deleted, migration).Is there any Disable-Migrations command, so I can rerun Enable-Migrations?You need to :Run the following command in the Package Manager Console:Use with or without -EnableAutomaticMigrationsAnd finally, you can run:The Issue: You have mucked up your migrations and you would like to reset it without deleting your existing tables.The Problem: You can\'t reset migrations with existing tables in the database as EF wants to create the tables from scratch.What to do:Delete existing migrations from Migrations_History table.Delete existing migrations from the Migrations Folder.Run add-migration Reset.  This will create a migration in your Migration folder that includes creating the tables (but it will not run it so it will not error out.)  You now need to create the initial row in the MigrationHistory table so EF has a snapshot of the current state. EF will do this if you apply a migration.  However, you can\'t apply the migration that you just made as the tables already exist in your database.  So go into the Migration and comment out all the code inside the "Up" method.Now run update-database.  It will apply the Migration (while not actually changing the database) and create a snapshot row in MigrationHistory.You have now reset your migrations and may continue with normal migrations.How about in Package Manager Console? It should reset all updates to its very early state.Reference link: Code First Migrations - Migrating to a Specific Version (Including Downgrade)To fix this, You need to: Delete all *.cs files in the Migrations Folder.Delete the _MigrationHistory Table in the Database    Run Enable-Migrations -EnableAutomaticMigrations -ForceRun Add-Migration ResetThen, in the public partial class Reset : DbMigration class, you need to comment all of the existing and current Tables:If you miss this bit all will fail and you have to start again!This should be successful if you have done the above correctly, and now you can carry on as normal.My problem turned out to be that I manually removed the Migrations folder. I did that because I wanted to back up the contents, so I simply dragged the folder out of the project. I later fixed the problem by putting it back in (after making a backup copy), then removing the Migrations folder by right-clicking it in Solutions Explorer and choosing Delete from the popup menu.In EntityFramework 6 please try:in order to update the initial migration file.In EF6
