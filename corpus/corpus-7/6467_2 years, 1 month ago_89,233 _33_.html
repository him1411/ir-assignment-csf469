I have updated my app to use the latest support library (version 23.0.0), I\'ve found out that they deprecated the onAttach() function of the Fragment class.Instead of:It\'s now:As my app uses the activity passed before deprecation, a possible solution i think is:Would that be the correct way to do it?UPDATE:If i run a device with API lower than 23, the new onAttach() is not even being called. I hope that this is not what they intended to do!UPDATE 2:Issue has been resolved with the latest updates to the SDK.I have tested on my API 22 device and onAttach(Context) is being called.Click here to follow the bug report I\'ve opened a couple of weeks ago and the answers from the guys at Google.Activity is a context so if you can simply check the context is an Activity and cast it if necessary.Update: Some are claiming that the new Context override is never called. I have done some tests and cannot find a scenario where this is true and according to the source code, it should never be true. In all cases I tested, both pre and post SDK23, both the Activity and the Context versions of onAttach were called.  If you can find a scenario where this is not the case, I would suggest you create a sample project illustrating the issue and report it to the Android team.Update 2: I only ever use the Android Support Library fragments as bugs get fixed faster there. It seems the above issue where the overrides do not get called correctly only comes to light if you use the framework fragments.If you use the the framework fragments and the SDK version of the device is lower than 23, OnAttach(Context context) wouldn\'t be called. I use support fragments instead, so deprecation is fixed and onAttach(Context context) always gets called.This is another great change from Google ... The suggested modification: replace onAttach(Activity activity) with onAttach(Context context) crashed my apps on older APIs since onAttach(Context context) will not be called on native fragments.I am using the native fragments (android.app.Fragment) so I had to do the following to make it work again on older APIs (< 23).Here is what I did:Currently from the onAttach Fragment code, it is not clear if the Context is the current activity: Source CodeIf you will take a look at getActivity you will see the same callSo If you want to be sure that you are getting the Activity then use  getActivity() (in onAttach in your Fragment) but don\'t forget to check for null because if mHost is null your activity will be nullDownload newest Support library with the sdk manager and include  in gradle.app and set compile version to api 23The answer below is related to this deprecation warning occurring in the Fragments tutorial on the Android developer website and may not be related to the posts above.  I used this code on the tutorial lesson and it did worked.I was worried that activity maybe null as what the documentation states.getActivityFragmentActivity getActivity ()\nReturn the FragmentActivity this fragment is currently associated with. May return null if the fragment is associated with a Context instead.But the onCreate on the main_activity clearly shows that the fragment was loaded and so after this method, calling get activity from the fragment will return the main_activity class.getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction()\n                    .add(R.id.fragment_container, firstFragment).commit();I hope I am correct with this. I am an absolute newbie.you are probably using android.support.v4.app.Fragment. For this instead of onAttach method, just use getActivity() to get the FragmentActivity with which the fragment is associated with. Else you could use onAttach(Context context) method.
