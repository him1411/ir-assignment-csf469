I need to convert seconds to Hour:Minute:Second.For example: 685 converted to 00:11:25How can I achieve this?You can use the gmdate() function:One hour is 3600sec, one minute is 60sec so why not:which produces:(I\'ve not tested this much, so there might be errors with floor or so)here you goUse function gmdate() only if seconds are less than 86400 (1 day) :See: gmdate()Run the DemoConvert seconds to format by \'foot\' no limit* :See: floor(), sprintf(), arithmetic operatorsRun the DemoExample use of DateTime extension:See: DateTime::__construct(), DateTime::modify(), clone,\n sprintf()Run the DemoMySQL example range of the result is constrained to that of the TIME data type, which is from -838:59:59 to 838:59:59 :See: SEC_TO_TIMERun the DemoPostgreSQL example:Run the DemoOther solutions use gmdate, but fail in edge cases where you have more than 86400 seconds. To get around this, we can simply compute the number of seconds ourselves, then let gmdate compute the remaining seconds into minutes/seconds.Input: 6030\nOutput: 1:40:30Input: 2000006030\nOutput: 555557:13:50Will not give time in H:i:s format if no_of_seconds is greater than 1 day (seconds in a day).\nIt will neglect day value and give only Hour:Min:SecondsFor example:Here is a one liner that handles negative seconds and more than 1 day worth of seconds.For Example:outputs: -26:03:04write function like this to return an arraythen simply call the function like this:output isSee:From: Convert seconds into days, hours, minutes and secondsThe gmtdate() function didn\'t work for me as I was tracking hours worked on a project and if it\'s over 24 hours, you get amount left over after 24 hours is subtracted. In other words 37 hours becomes 13 hours. (all as stated above by Glavic - thanks for your examples!)\nThis one worked well:Try this:Taken from\nhttp://bytes.com/topic/php/answers/3917-seconds-converted-hh-mm-ssThis function my be useful, you could extend it:A simple way to use DateTime for this is:It\'s a simple solution wich gives you the ability to use the format Method of DateTime.Solution from: https://gist.github.com/SteveJobzniak/c91a8e2426bac5cb9b0cbc1bdbc45e4bThis code avoids as much as possible of the tedious function calls and piece-by-piece string-building, and the big and bulky functions people are making for this.It produces "1h05m00s" format and uses leading zeroes for minutes and seconds, as long as another non-zero time component precedes them.And it skips all empty leading components to avoid giving you useless info like "0h00m01s" (instead that will show up as "1s").Example results: "1s", "1m00s", "19m08s", "1h00m00s", "4h08m39s".If you want to make the code even shorter (but less readable), you can avoid the $converted array and instead put the values directly in the sprintf() call, as follows:Duration must be 0 or higher in both of the code pieces above. Negative durations are not supported. But you can handle negative durations by using the following alternative code instead:Just in case anyone else is looking for a simple function to return this nicely formatted (I know it is not the format the OP asked for), this is what I\'ve just come up with. Thanks to @mughal for the code this was based on.Anyone whose looking for this in the future, this gives the format the initial poster asked for.
