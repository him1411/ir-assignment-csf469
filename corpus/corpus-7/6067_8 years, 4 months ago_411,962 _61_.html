Given an array of ids $galleries = array(1,2,5) I want to have a SQL query that uses the values of the array in its WHERE clause like:How can I generate this query string to use with MySQL?BEWARE! This answer contains a severe SQL injection vulnerability. Do NOT use the code samples as presented here, without making sure that any external input is sanitized.Using PDO:[1]Using MySQLi [2]Explanation:In general it looks like this:We can build an expression to place inside the () from our array. Note that there must be at least one value inside the parenthesis or MySQL will return an error; this equates to making sure that our input array has at least one value. To help prevent against SQL injection attacks, first generate a ? for each input item to create a parameterized query. Here I assume that the array containing your ids is called $ids:Given an input array of three items $select will look like:Again note that there is a ? for each item in the input array. Then we\'ll use PDO or MySQLi to prepare and execute the query as noted above.It is easy to change between strings and integers because of the bound parameters. For PDO there is no change required; for MySQLi change str_repeat(\'i\', to str_repeat(\'s\', if you need to check strings. [1]: I\'ve omitted some error checking for brevity. You need to check for the usual errors for each database method (or set your DB driver to throw exceptions).[2]: Requires PHP 5.6 or higher. Again I\'ve omitted some error checking for brevity.ints:strings:Assuming you properly sanitize your inputs beforehand...Then just adjust your query:Quote values appropriately depending on your dataset.Use:A simple for each loop will work.Flavius/AvatarKava\'s way is better, but make sure that none of the array values contain commas.As Flavius Stef\'s answer, you can use intval() to make sure all id are int values:For MySQLi with an escape function:For PDO with prepared statement:Safer.We can use this "WHERE id IN" clause if we filter the input array properly. Something like this:Like the example below:I.e. now you should safely use $query = "SELECT * FROM galleries WHERE id IN ({$galleryIds})";We should take care of SQL injection vulnerabilities and an empty condition. I am going to handle both as below.For a pure numeric array, use the appropriate type conversion viz intval or floatval or doubleval over each element. For string types mysqli_real_escape_string() which may also be applied to numeric values if you wish. MySQL allows numbers as well as date variants as string.To appropriately escape the values before passing to the query, create a function similar to:Such a function would most likely be already available to you in your application, or maybe you\'ve already created one.Sanitize the string array like:A numeric array can be sanitized using intval or floatval or doubleval instead as suitable:Then finally build the query conditionorSince the array can also be empty sometimes, like $galleries = array(); we should therefore note that IN () does not allow for an empty list. One can also use OR instead, but the problem remains. So the above check, count($values), is to ensure the same.And add it to the final query:TIP: If you want to show all records (no filtering) in case of an empty array instead of hiding all rows, simply replace 0 with 1 in the ternary\'s false part.Col. Shrapnel\'s SafeMySQL library for PHP provides type-hinted placeholders in its parametrised queries, and includes a couple of convenient placeholders for working with arrays. The ?a placeholder expands out an array to a comma-separated list of escaped strings*.For example:* Note that since MySQL performs automatic type coercion, it doesn\'t matter that SafeMySQL will convert the ids above to strings - you\'ll still get the correct result.You may have table texts (T_ID (int), T_TEXT (text)) and table test (id (int), var (varchar(255)))In insert into test values (1, \'1,2,3\') ; the following will output rows from table texts where T_ID IN (1,2,3):This way you can manage a simple n2m database relation without an extra table and using only SQL without the need to use PHP or some other programming language.Because the original question relates to an array of numbers and I am using an array of strings I couldn\'t make the given examples work.I found that each string needed to be encapsulated in single quotes to work with the IN() function.  Here is my solutionAs you can see the first function wraps each array variable in single quotes (\\\') and then implodes the array.NOTE: $status does not have single quotes in the SQL statement.There is probably a nicer way to add the quotes but this works.Besides using the IN query, you have two options to do so as in an IN query there is a risk of an SQL injection vulnerability. You can use looping to get the exact data you want or you can use the query with OR caseMore an example:Basic methods to prevent SQL injection are:Using prepared statements and parameterized queries query is considered the better practice, but if you choose the escaping characters method then you can try my example below.You can generate the queries by using array_map to add a single quote to each of elements in the $galleries:The generated $sql var will be:Note: mysql_real_escape_string, as described in its documentation here, was deprecated in PHP 5.5.0, and it was removed in PHP 7.0.0. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL extension should be used. See also MySQL: choosing an API guide and related FAQ for more information.
