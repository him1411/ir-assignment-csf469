Can anyone tell me how to make an EditText not editable via XML? I tried setting android:editable to false, butUse this simple code:It works.Edit : To add KeyListener later, do following1 : set key listener to tag of textView2 : get key listener from tag and set it back to textViewAdd this to your EditText xml file:It will do the same effect as android:editable="false". Worked for me, hope it\'ll work for you too.Let your Edittext be editText.setKeyListener(null); will work but it just not listening to keys.User can see a cursor on the edittext.You can try editText.setEnabled(false);That means user cannot see the cursor. To simply say it will became TextView.disable from XML (one line):re-enable from Java, if need be (also one line):As mentioned in some of the answers above, you can do a setEnabled(false)  but since you are asking how to set it via XML, here is how to do it.Add the following attribute to your EditText:They made "editable" deprecated but didn\'t provide a working corresponding one in inputType.By the way, does inputType="none" has any effect? Using it or not does not make any difference as far as I see.For example, the default editText is said to be single line. But you have to select an inputType for it to be single line. And if you select "none", it is still multiline.As you mentioned android:editable is deprecated. android:inputType="none" should be used instead but it does not work due to a bug (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2854)But you can achieve the same thing by using focusable.Via XML:From code:if you want to click it, but not want to edit it, try:If you want to do it in java code just use this line to disable it:And this to enable it:I tried to do:which should work, but for me it did not.I finished with this code:which works perfectly.and use following :Just use  android:enabled="false". This will also give an appearance to the EditText which will make it look not editable.You could use android:editable="false" but I would really advise you \nto use setEnabled(false) as it provides a visual clue to the user that \nthe control cannot be edited. The same visual cue is used by all \ndisabled widgets and consistency is good.When I want an activity to not focus on the EditText and also not show keyboard when clicked, this is what worked for me. Adding attributes to the main layout and then the EditText fieldHere is an example:I\'ve tried the following:but the problem was that if the edit text is the first in the form then\nit gets the focus and the pickCode() code which launches a new activity\nis called straight away. So I modified the code as follows and it seems\nto work quite well (except I cannot set the focus on the text edit but\nI don\'t need to):Best Regards,Comments welcome,John GocheIn addition to @mahe madi\nyou can try this as wellThis method will hide cursor, lose focus and more importantly set text color to black behaving like TextView.And to revert Back to editText simply do this to gain all the properties of EditText.Hope it Helps :)I use EditText.setFocusable(false) and set true again if I want to edit.android:editable is deprecated so use inputType instead.Try this : This way did the job for me, i can selec and copy to clipboard, but i can\'t modify or paste.This combination worked for me:I have faced same problem but after observation I found that android:editable="false" is only working when inputtype (android:inputType="ANY_VALUE") is not given in the Edittext.Remove inputType from EditText and use editable = false, its working fine.TryTry this code. It\'s working in my project, so it will work in your project.
