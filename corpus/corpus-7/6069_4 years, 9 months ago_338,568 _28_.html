I have to disable inputs at first and then on click of a link to enable them.This is what I have tried so far, but it doesn\'t work:HTML:jQuery:This shows me true and then false but nothing changes for the inputs:Always use the prop() method to enable or disable elements when using jQuery (see below for why).In your case, it would be:jsFiddle example here.Why use prop() when you could use attr()/removeAttr() to do this?Basically, prop() should be used when getting or setting properties (such as autoplay, checked, disabled and required amongst others). By using removeAttr(), you are completely removing the disabled attribute itself - while prop() is merely setting the property\'s underlying boolean value to false. While what you want to do can be done using attr()/removeAttr(), it doesn\'t mean it should be done (and can cause strange/problematic behaviour, as in this case).The following extracts (taken from the jQuery documentation for prop()) explain these points in greater detail:"The difference between attributes and properties can be important in\n  specific situations. Before jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method sometimes\n  took property values into account when retrieving some attributes,\n  which could cause inconsistent behavior. As of jQuery 1.6, the .prop()\n  method provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while\n  .attr() retrieves attributes.""Properties generally affect the dynamic state of a DOM element without\n  changing the serialized HTML attribute. Examples include the value\n  property of input elements, the disabled property of inputs and\n  buttons, or the checked property of a checkbox. The .prop() method\n  should be used to set disabled and checked instead of the .attr()\n  method. The .val() method should be used for getting and setting\n  value."http://jsfiddle.net/ZwHfY/to remove disabled attribute use,and to add disabled attribute use,Enjoy :)Use like this,HTML:JS:I think you are trying to toggle the disabled state, in witch case you should use this (from this question):Here is a working fiddle.This was the only code that worked for me:Note that it\'s removeProp and not removeAttr.I\'m using jQuery 2.1.3 here.Thought this you can easily setup
