I cloned a git repository of a certain project. Can I turn the files to the initial state and when I review the files go to revision 2, 3, 4 ... most recent? I\'d like to have an overview of how the project was evolving.Use git checkout <sha1> to check out a particular commit.You can get a graphical view of the project history with tools like gitk. Just run:If you want to checkout a specific branch:For a specific commit, use the SHA1 hash instead of the branch name. (See Treeishes in the Git Community Book, which is a good read, to see other options for navigating your tree.)git log has a whole set of options to display detailed or summary history too.I don\'t know of an easy way to move forward in a commit history. Projects with a linear history are probably not all that common. The idea of a "revision" like you\'d have with SVN or CVS doesn\'t map all that well in Git.To go to a particular version/commit run following commands. HASH-CODE you can get from git log --oneline -n 10Note - After reset to particular version/commit you can run git pull --rebase, if you want to bring back all the commits which are discarded.I have created a command line python tool to see how a project evolved. you could see if that helps. The tool is hosted on the git at the following urlhttps://github.com/yoganand/git-evolverUsing a commit\'s SHA1 key, you could do the following:First, find the commit you want for a specific file:git log -n <# commits> <file-name>This, based on your <# commits>, will generate a list of commits for a specific file.TIP: if you aren\'t sure what commit you are looking for, a good way to find out is using the following command: git diff <commit-SHA1>..HEAD <file-name>.  This command will show the difference between the current version of a commit, and a previous version of a commit for a specific file.NOTE: a commit\'s SHA1 key is formatted in the git log -n\'s list as: commit <SHA1 id>Second, checkout the desired version:If you have found the desired commit/version you want, simply use the command: git checkout <desired-SHA1> <file-name>This will place the version of the file you specified in the staging area.  To take it out of the staging area simply use the command: reset HEAD <file-name>To revert back to where the remote repository is pointed to, simply use the command: git checkout HEAD <file-name>One way would be to create all commits ever made to patches. checkout the initial commit and then apply the patches in order after reading. use git format-patch <initial revision> and then git checkout <initial revision>.\nyou should get a pile of files in your director starting with four digits which are the patches. when you are done reading your revision just do git apply <filename> which should look like \ngit apply 0001-* and count.But I really wonder why you wouldn\'t just want to read the patches itself instead? Please post this in your comments because I\'m curious.the git manual also gives me this:Shows the contents of the file Documentation/README as they were current in the 10th last commit of the branch next.you could also have a look at git blame filename which gives you a listing where each line is associated with a commit hash + author.I\'d like to mention the command-line tool tig, available seemingly everywhere. It is a text-graphical tree-view with tag display, etc. of project revision history. It can be used over ssh, etc. Super handy.The best tool available to use is smartgit . You can pull and push. Its free for non commercial use. Makes life easy
