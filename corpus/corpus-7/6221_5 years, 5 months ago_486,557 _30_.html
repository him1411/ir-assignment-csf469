I have a table of 3 by 3. I need a way to add a border for the bottom of every row tr and give it a specific color.First I tried the direct way, i.e.:But that didn\'t work. So I added CSS like this:That still didn\'t work.I would prefer to use CSS because then I don\'t need to add a style attribute to every row.\nI haven\'t added a border attribute to the <table>. I hope that that is not affecting my CSS.I had a problem like this before. I don\'t think tr can take a border styling directly. My workaround was to style the tds in the row:CSS:Add border-collapse:collapse to your table rule:LinkUse border-collapse:collapse on table and border-bottom: 1pt solid black; on the trUse border-collapse:collapse as Nathan wrote and you need to settd { border-bottom: 1px solid #000; }There are lot of incomplete answers here. Since you cannot apply a border to tr tag, you need to apply it to the td or th tags like so:Doing this will leave a small space between each td, which is likely not desirable if you want the border to appear as though it is the tr tag. In order to "fill in the gaps" so to speak, you need to utilize the border-collapse property on the table element and set its value to collapse, like so:Display the row as a block.and to display alternate colors simply:Use Replace "thin solid" with CSS properties.I found when using this method that the space between the td elements caused a gap to form in the border, but have no fear...One way around this:With the CSS:<td style="border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom: thick dotted #ff0000; ">You can do the same to the whole row as well.There is border-bottom-style, border-top-style,border-left-style,border-right-style. Or simply border-style that apply to all four borders at once.You can see (and TRY YOURSELF online) more details hereThis worked for me in firefox and IE 11:I just got border bottom to work in the tr row. You were all missing the word STYLE:HTMLCSS
