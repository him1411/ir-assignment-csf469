I have the following convention for most of my projects:You\'ll notice that I do not keep external libraries inside the source folder. I\'m also very interested in using NuGet but don\'t want these external libraries inside the source folder. Does NuGet have a setting to change the directory that all packages are loaded into?It\'s now possible to control which folder the packages are installed into. http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/215Edit:\nSee Phil Haack\'s comment on Dec 10 2010 at 11:45 PM (in the work item/the link above). The support is partially implemented in 1.0, but is not documented.According to @dfowler:\nAdd a nuget.config file next to the solution with this:There is a nuget package for creating the package folder override.Update for version 2.1As Azat commented, there is now official documentation on how to control the package locations. The release notes for 2.1 specifies the following configuration in a nuget.config file (see the release notes for a description of valid places to put the config files and how the hierarchical configuration model works):This would change the packages folder for the configuration level you put the file in (solution if you put it in the solution directory, project in project directory and so on). Note that the release notes state: [...] if you have an existing packages folder underneath your solution\n  root, you will need to delete it before NuGet will place packages in\n  the new location.this did NOT work for me:this did WORK for me:Okay for the sake of anyone else reading this post - here is what I understand of the myriad of answers above:The nuget.config file in the .nuget folder is relative to that folder.  This is important because if your new folder is something like \'../Packages\' that will put it where it always goes out of the box.  As @bruce14 states you must do \'../../Packages\' insteadI could not get the latest nuget (2.8.5) to find a packages folder outside of the standard location without enabling package restore.  So once you enable package restore then the following should be added to the nuget.config file inside of the .nuget folder to change the location:(This is important) If you make ANY changes to the package folder location inside of the nuget.config files you must restart visual studio or close/reload the solution for the changes to take effectA solution for Nuget 3.2 on Visual Studio 2015 is:Using forward slash for parent folder.\nSave above file (nuget.config) in solution folder.The solution proposed in release notes for 2.1 doesn\'t work out-of-the-box. They forgot to mention that there is code:which prevents it from working. To fix this you need to modify your NuGet.targets file and remove \'OutputDirectory\' parameter:So now, if you add \'repositoryPath\' config somewhere in NuGet.config (see the release notes for a description of valid places to put the config files), it will restore all packages into single location, but... Your .csproj still contains hints to assemblies written as relative paths...I still don\'t understand why they went hard way instead of changing PackageManager so it would add hint paths relative to PackagesDir. That\'s the way I do manually to have different package locations locally (on my desktop) and on build agent.In addition to Shane Kms answer, if you\'ve activated Nuget Package Restore, you edit the NuGet.config located in the .nuget-folder as follows:Notice the extra "..\\", as it backtracks from the .nuget-folder and not the solution folder.The config file in the accepted answer works for me in VS2012.\nHowever, for me it only works when I do the following:If I follow those steps I can use a shared package folder.For .NET Core projects and Visual Studio 2017 I was able to restore all packages to relative path by providing this configuration:Based on my experience the lib folder was created on the same level where Nuget.config was found, no matter where sln file was.\nI tested and the behavior is same for command line dotnet restore, and Visual Studio 2017 rebuildNone of this answers was working for me (Nuget 2.8.6) because of missing some tips, will try to add them here as it might be useful for others.After reading the following sources: \nhttps://docs.nuget.org/consume/NuGet-Config-Settings\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1346\nIt appears thatE.g. You can also use NuGet command to ensure that syntax will be correct like this:One more little tidbit that I just discovered. (This may be so basic that some haven\'t mentioned it, but it was important for my solution.) The "packages" folder ends up in the same folder as your .sln file.We moved our .sln file and then fixed all of the paths inside to find the various projects and voila! Our packages folder ended up where we wanted it.Just updating with Nuget 2.8.3. To change the location of installed packages , I enabled package restore from right clicking solution. Edited NuGet.Config and added these lines :Then rebuilt the solution, it downloaded all packages to my desired folder and updated references automatically. UPDATE for VS 2017:Looks people in Nuget team finally started to use Nuget themselves which helped them to find and fix several important things. So now (if I\'m not mistaken, as still didn\'t migrated to VS 2017) the below is not necessary any more. You should be able to set the "repositoryPath" to a local folder and it will work. Even you can leave it at all as by default restore location moved out of solution folders to machine level. Again - I still didn\'t test it by myselfVS 2015 and earlier Just a tip to other answers (specifically this):Location of the NuGet Package folder can be changed via configuration, but VisualStudio still reference assemblies in this folder relatively:To workaround this (until a better solution) I used subst command to create a virtual driver which points to a new location of the Packages folder:Now when adding a new NuGet package, the project reference use its absolute location:Note:The most consistent way is via using nuget config to correctly set the config:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/configuring-nuget-behavior#changing-config-settings
