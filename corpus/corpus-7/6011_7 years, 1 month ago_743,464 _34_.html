There is a string, for example EXAMPLEHow can I remove the middle character i.e. M from it. I don\'t need the code, what I want to know isIn Python, strings are immutable, so you have to create a new string.  You have a few options of how to create the new string.  If you want to remove the \'M\' wherever it appears:If you want to remove the central character:You asked if strings end with a special character.  No, you are thinking like a C programmer.  In Python, strings are stored with their length, so any byte value, including \\0, can appear in a string.This is probably the best way:Don\'t worry about shifting characters and such.  Most python takes place on a much higher level of abstraction.To replace a specific position:To replace a specific character:Strings are immutable. But you can convert them to a list, which is mutable, and then convert the list back to a string after you\'ve changed it.You can also create a new string, as others have shown, by taking everything except the character you want from the existing string.I didn\'t see see the translate() method mentioned, so here goes:How can I remove the middle characterYou can\'t, because strings in Python are immutable.Do strings in python end in any special character?No. They are similar to lists of characters; the length of the list defines the length of the string, and no character acts as a terminator.Which is a better way - shifting everything right to left starting from the middle character OR creation of a new string and not copying the middle character?You cannot modify the existing string, so you must create a new one containing everything except the middle character.UserString.MutableStringmutable way:How to remove one character from a string:\nHere is an example where there is a stack of cards represented as characters in a string.\nOne of them is drawn (import random module for the random.choice() function, that picks a random character in the string).\nA new string, cardsLeft, is created to hold the remaining cards given by the string function replace() where the last parameter indicates that only one "card" is to be replaced by the empty string...i have seen this somewhere hereI am just learning to code.  Here\'s what I did to slice out the "M"If you want to delete/ignore characters in within a string so for instance you have this string"[11:L:0]"from a web api response or something like that, like a CSV, let\'s say you are using requestsloop and get rid of unwanted charsoptional split and you will be able to read values individuallynow accessing each value is easierthis will print11L0Strings are immutable in Python so both your options mean the same thing basically.
