How can I get the current time in milliseconds in Python? For what I needed, here\'s what I did, based on @samplebias\' comment above:Quick\'n\'easy. Thanks all, sorry for the brain fart.For reuse:Then:time.time() may only give resolution to the second, the preferred approach for milliseconds is datetimeIf you want a simple method in your code that returns the milliseconds with datetime:another solution is the function you can embed into your own utils.pyMicroseconds is 1/1000000 seconds, milliseconds is 1/1000 seconds sodt.microseconds/1000.0 should be dt.microseconds/1000000.0
