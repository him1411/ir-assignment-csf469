My Case: localStorage with key + value that should be deleted when browser is closed and not single tab.Please see my code if its proper and what can be improved:should be done like that and not with delete operator:You can make use of the beforeunload event in JavaScript.Using vanilla JavaScript you could do something like:That will delete the key before the browser window/tab is closed and prompts you to confirm the close window/tab action. I hope that solves your problem.NOTE: The onbeforeunload method should return a string.You should use the sessionStorage instead if you want the key to be deleted when the browser close.Use with window global keyword:-Try using Hope this works for youThere is a very specific use case in which any suggestion to use sessionStorage instead of localStorage does not really help.\nThe use-case would be something as simple as having something stored while you have at least one tab opened, but invalidate it if you close the last tab remaining.\nIf you need your values to be saved cross-tab and window, sessionStorage does not help you unless you complicate your life with listeners, like I have tried.\nIn the meantime localStorage would be perfect for this, but it does the job \'too well\', since your data will be waiting there even after a restart of the browser.\nI ended up using a custom code and logic that takes advantage of both.I\'d rather explain then give code. First store what you need to in localStorage, then also in localStorage create a counter that will contain the number of tabs that you have opened.\nThis will be increased every time the page loads and decreased every time the page unloads. You can have your pick here of the events to use, I\'d suggest \'load\' and \'unload\'.\nAt the time you unload, you need to do the cleanup tasks that you\'d like to when the counter reaches 0, meaning you\'re closing the last tab.\nHere comes the tricky part: I haven\'t found a reliable and generic way to tell the difference between a page reload or navigation inside the page and the closing of the tab.\nSo If the data you store is not something that you can rebuild on load after checking that this is your first tab, then you cannot remove it at every refresh.\nInstead you need to store a flag in sessionStorage at every load before increasing the tab counter.\nBefore storing this value, you can make a check to see if it already has a value and if it doesn\'t,\nthis means you\'re loading into this session for the first time, meaning that you can do the cleanup at load if this value is not set and the counter is 0.use sessionStorageThe sessionStorage object is equal to the localStorage object, except that it stores the data for only one session. The data is deleted when the user closes the browser window.The following example counts the number of times a user has clicked a button, in the current session:ExampleHere\'s a simple test to see if you have browser support when working with local storage:It worked for me as expected (I use Google Chrome). \nAdapted from: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp.I don\'t think the solution presented here is 100% correct because window.onbeforeunload event is called not only when browser/Tab is closed(WHICH IS REQUIRED), but also on all other several events. (WHICH MIGHT NOT BE REQUIRED)See this link for more information on list of events that can fire window.onbeforeunload:-http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536907(VS.85).aspxAlthough, some users already answered this question already, I am giving an example of application settings to solve this problem.I had the same issue. I am using https://github.com/grevory/angular-local-storage module in my angularjs application. If you configure your app as follows, it will save variable in session storage instead of local storage. Therefore, if you close the browser or close the tab, session storage will be removed automatically. You do not need to do anything. Hope it will help.why not used sessionStorage?"The sessionStorage object is equal to the localStorage object, except that it stores the data for only one session. The data is deleted when the user closes the browser window." http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.aspThis will work like a charmTry.
