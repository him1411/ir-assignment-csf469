I have committed loads of files that I now want to ignore. How can I tell git to now ignore these files from future commits? EDIT: I do want to remove them from the repository too. They are files created after ever build or for user-specific tooling support.See also:After editing .gitignore to match the ignored files, you can do git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard to see the files that are included in the exclude lists; you can then do git ls-files -ci --exclude-standard -z | xargs -0 git rm --cached to remove them from the repository (without deleting them from disk).Edit: You can also add this as an alias in your .gitconfig file so you can run it anytime you like. Just add the following line under the [alias] section:(The -r flag in xargs prevents git rm from running on an empty result and printing out its usage message, but may only be supported by GNU findutils.  Other versions of xargs may or may not have a similar option.)Now you can just type git apply-gitignore in your repo, and it\'ll do the work for you!to leave the file in the repo but ignore future changes to it:and to undo this:to find out which files have been set this way:credit for the original answer to \nhttp://blog.pagebakers.nl/2009/01/29/git-ignoring-changes-in-tracked-files/Be sure that your actual repo is the lastest versionthen commit as usualOld question, but some of us are in git-posh (powershell).
