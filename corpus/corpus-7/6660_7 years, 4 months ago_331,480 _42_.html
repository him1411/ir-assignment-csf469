I have a data frame. Let\'s call him bob:I\'d like to concatenate the rows of this data frame (this will be another question). But look:Bob\'s columns are factors. So, for example:I don\'t begin to understand this, but I guess these are indices into the levels of the factors of the columns (of the court of king caractacus) of bob? Not what I need.Strangely I can go through the columns of bob by hand, and dowhich works fine. And, after some typing, I can get a data.frame whose columns are characters rather than factors. So my question is: how can I do this automatically? How do I convert a data.frame with factor columns into a data.frame with character columns without having to manually go through each column? Bonus question: why does the manual approach work?Just following on Matt and Dirk.  If you want to recreate your existing data frame without changing the global option, you can recreate it with an apply statement:This will convert all variables to class "character", if you want to only convert factors, see Marek\'s solution below.As @hadley points out, the following is more concise. In both cases, lapply outputs a list; however, owing to the magical properties of R, the use of [] in the second case keeps the data.frame class of the bob object, thereby eliminating the need to convert back to a data.frame using as.data.frame with the argument stringsAsFactors = FALSE.To replace only factors:In package dplyr in version 0.5.0 new function mutate_if was introduced:Package purrr from RStudio gives another alternative:(keep in mind it\'s fresh package)The global optionstringsAsFactors:\n      The default setting for arguments of data.frame and read.table.may be something you want to set to FALSE in your startup files (e.g. ~/.Rprofile). Please see help(options).I know this answer is a bit late, but if you understand how factors are stored, you can avoid using apply-based functions to accomplish this. Which isn\'t at all to imply that the apply solutions don\'t work well.Factors are structured as numeric indices tied to a list of \'levels\'. This can be seen if you convert a factor to numeric. So:The numbers returned in the last line correspond to the levels of the factor.Notice that levels() returns an array of characters. You can use this fact to easily and compactly convert factors to strings or numerics like this:This also works for numeric values, provided you wrap your expression in as.numeric().If you want a new data frame bobc where every factor vector in bobf is converted to a character vector, try this:If you then want to convert it back, you can create a logical vector of which columns are factors, and use that to selectively apply factorI typically make this function apart of all my projects. Quick and easy.Another way is to convert it using applyAnd a better one (the previous is of class \'matrix\')Or you can try transform:Just be sure to put every factor you\'d like to convert to character.Or you can do something like this and kill all the pests with one blow:It\'s not good idea to shove the data in code like this, I could do the sapply part separately (actually, it\'s much easier to do it like that), but you get the point... I haven\'t checked the code, \'cause I\'m not at home, so I hope it works! =)This approach, however, has a downside... you must reorganize columns afterwards, while with transform you can do whatever you like, but at cost of "pedestrian-style-code-writting"...So there... =)Update: Here\'s an example of something that doesn\'t work.  I thought it would, but I think that the stringsAsFactors option only works on character strings - it leaves the factors alone.Try this:Generally speaking, whenever you\'re having problems with factors that should be characters, there\'s a stringsAsFactors setting somewhere to help you (including a global setting).At the beginning of your data frame include stringsAsFactors = FALSE to ignore all misunderstandings. This works for me - I finally figured a one linerIf you would use data.table package for the operations on data.frame then the problem is not present.  If you have a factor columns in you dataset already and you want to convert them to character you can do the following.
