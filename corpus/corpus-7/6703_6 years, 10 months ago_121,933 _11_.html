How do I prevent a jQuery Ajax request from caching in Internet Explorer?You can disable caching globally using $.ajaxSetup(), for example:This appends a timestamp to the querystring when making the request.  To turn cache off for a particular $.ajax() call, set cache: false on it locally, like this:If you set unique parameters, then the cache does not work, for example:These two header values can be combined to get the required effect on both IE and FirefoxHere is an answer proposal: http://www.greenvilleweb.us/how-to-web-design/problem-with-ie-9-caching-ajax-get-request/The idea is to add a parameter to your ajax query containing for example the current date an time, so the browser will not be able to cache it. Have a look on the link, it is well explained. This is an old post, but if IE is giving you trouble. Change your GET requests to POST and IE will no longer cache them. I spent way too much time figuring this out the hard way. Hope it helps.
