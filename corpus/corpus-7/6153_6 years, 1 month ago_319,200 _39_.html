How can I merge/combine two value in R?\nFor example I have:My goal is to get tmp as one string Which Function can do this for me?is the way to go. As the previous posters pointed out, paste can do two things:concatenate values into one "string", e.g.where the argument sep specifies the character(s) to be used between the arguments to concatenate,\nor collapse character vectorswhere the argument collapse specifies the character(s) to be used between the elements of the vector to be collapsed.You can even combine both:Hope this helps.help.search() is a handy function, e.g. will lead you to paste().For the first non-paste() answer, we can look at stringr::str_c() (and then toString() below). It hasn\'t been around as long as this question, so I think it\'s useful to mention that it also exists.  Very simple to use, as you can see.From its documentation file description, it fits this problem nicely.To understand how str_c works, you need to imagine that you are building up a matrix of strings. Each input argument forms a column, and is expanded to the length of the longest argument, using the usual recyling rules. The sep string is inserted between each column. If collapse is NULL each row is collapsed into a single string. If non-NULL that string is inserted at the end of each row, and the entire matrix collapsed to a single string.Added 4/13/2016: It\'s not exactly the same as your desired output (extra space), but no one has mentioned it either.  toString() is basically a version of paste() with collapse = ", " hard-coded, so you can doI found this from Google by searching for R concatenate strings: http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/paste.htmlAs others have pointed out, paste() is the way to go. But it can get annoying to have to type paste(str1, str2, str3, sep=\'\') everytime you want the non-default separator.You can very easily create wrapper functions that make like much simpler. For instance, if you find yourself concatenating strings with no separator really often, you can do:or if you often want to join strings from a vector (like implode() from php):Allows you do do this:Also, there is the built in paste0, which does the same thing as my implode, but without allowing custom separators. It\'s slightly more efficient than paste().Given the matrix, tmp, that you created:I assume there is some reason why you\'re creating a matrix using cbind, as opposed to simply:print(joined) will return "hello, world"Alternatively, if your objective is to output directly to a file or stdout, you can use catYou can create you own operator :You can also redefine \'and\' (&) operator :messing with baseline syntax is ugly, but so is using paste()/paste0() if you work only with your own code you can (almost always) replace logical & and operator with * and do multiplication of logical values instead of using logical \'and &\' Another way:It sometimes useful than paste() function. %s denotes the place where the subjective strings will be included.Note that this will come in handy as you try to build a path:outputUse "Paste" command to concatenate.For more details : https://www.r-bloggers.com/string-concatenation-in-r/The simplest way for beginner to concatenate string is by using str_c.Please install stringr the package by : \ninstall.packages("stringr")Consider the case where the strings are columns and the result should be a new column:Optionally, skip the [c("a", "b")] subsetting if all columns needs to be pasted.
