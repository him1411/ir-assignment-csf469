I have a form with input fields and validation setup by adding the required attributes and such. But for some fields I need to do some extra validation. How would I "tap in" to the validation that FormController controls? Custom validation could be something like "if these 3 fields are filled in, then this field is required and needs to be formatted in a particular way".There\'s a method in FormController.$setValidity but that doesn\'t look like a public API so I rather not use it. Creating a custom directive and using NgModelController looks like another option, but would basically require me to create a directive for each custom validation rule, which I do not want.Actually, marking a field from the controller as invalid (while also keeping FormController in sync) might be the thing that I need in the simplest scenario to get the job done, but I don\'t know how to do that.Edit: added information about ngMessages (>= 1.3.X) below.Since this is one of the top results if you Google "Angular Form Validation", currently, I want to add another answer to this for anyone coming in from there.There\'s a method in FormController.$setValidity but that doesn\'t look like a public API so I rather not use it. It\'s "public", no worries. Use it. That\'s what it\'s for. If it weren\'t meant to be used, the Angular devs would have privatized it in a closure.To do custom validation, if you don\'t want to use Angular-UI as the other answer suggested, you can simply roll your own validation directive.And here\'s some example usage:Note: in 1.2.X it\'s probably preferrable to substitute ng-if for ng-show aboveHere is an obligatory plunker linkAlso, I\'ve written a few blog entries about just this subject that goes into a little more detail:Angular Form ValidationCustom Validation DirectivesYou can now use the ngMessages module instead of ngShow to show your error messages. It will actually work with anything, it doesn\'t have to be an error message, but here\'s the basics:Reference ngMessages in your module declaration:Add the appropriate markup:In the above markup, ng-message="personForm.email.$error" basically specifies a context for the ng-message child directives. Then  ng-message="required" and ng-message="email" specify properties on that context to watch. Most importantly, they also specify an order to check them in. The first one it finds in the list that is "truthy" wins, and it will show that message and none of the others.And a plunker for the ngMessages exampleAngular-UI\'s project includes a ui-validate directive, which will probably help you with this.  It let\'s you specify a function to call to do the validation.Have a look at the demo page: http://angular-ui.github.com/, search down to the Validate heading.From the demo page:then in your controller:You can use  ng-required for your validation scenario ("if these 3 fields are filled in, then this field is required":You can use Angular-Validator.Example: using a function to validate a fieldThen in your controller you would have something likeYou can also do something like this:(where field1 field2, and field3 are scope variables. You might also want to check if the fields do not equal the empty string)If the field does not pass the validator then the field will be marked as invalid and the user will not be able to submit the form.For more use cases and examples see: https://github.com/turinggroup/angular-validatorDisclaimer: I am the author of Angular-ValidatorHere\'s a cool way to do custom wildcard expression validations in a form (from: Advanced form validation with AngularJS and filters):jsFiddle demo (supports expression naming and multiple expressions)It\'s similar to ui-validate, but you don\'t need a scope specific validation function (this works generically) and ofcourse you don\'t need ui.utils this way.I recently created a directive to allow for expression-based invalidation of angular form inputs.  Any valid angular expression can be used, and it supports custom validation keys using object notation.  Tested with angular v1.3.8You can use it like this:Or by just passing in an expression (it will be given the default validationKey of "invalidIf")@synergetic I think @blesh suppose to put function validate as belowUpdate:Improved and simplified version of previous directive (one instead of two) with same functionality:Example usage:Result: Mutually dependent test expressions where validators are executed on change of other\'s directive model and current model. Test expression has local $model variable which you should use to compare it to other variables.Previously:I\'ve made an attempt to improve @Plantface code by adding extra directive. This extra directive very useful if our expression needs to be executed when changes are made in more than one ngModel variables.Example how to use it to make cross validated fields:ensure-expression is executed to validate model when ng-model or any of ensure-watch variables is changed.In AngularJS the best place to define Custom Validation is Cutsom directive.\nAngularJS provide a ngMessages module.ngMessages is a directive that is designed to show and hide messages\n  based on the state of a key/value object that it listens on. The\n  directive itself complements error message reporting with the ngModel\n  $error object (which stores a key/value state of validation errors).For custom form validation One should use ngMessages Modules with custom directive.Here i have a simple validation which will check if number length is less then 6 display an error on screenHere is how to create custom validation directive$setValidity is inbuilt function to set model state to valid/invalid I extended @Ben Lesh\'s answer with an ability to specify whether the validation is case sensitive or not (default)use:\ncode:\nSome great examples and libs presented in this thread, but they didn\'t quite have what I was looking for. My approach: angular-validity -- a promise based validation lib for asynchronous validation, with optional Bootstrap styling baked-in.An angular-validity solution for the OP\'s use case might look something like this:Here\'s a Fiddle, if you want to take it for a spin. The lib is available on GitHub, has detailed documentation, and plenty of live demos.Use the ngModelController $asyncValidators API which handles asynchronous validation, such as making an $http request to the backend. Functions added to the object must return a promise that must be resolved when valid or rejected when invalid. In-progress async validations are stored by key in ngModelController.$pending.
