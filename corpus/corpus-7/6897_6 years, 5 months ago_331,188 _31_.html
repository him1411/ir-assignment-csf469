How to install Eclipse plugin from .zip? I have installed plugins by choosing the site and then check but never from .zip. Can anybody help?It depends on what the zip contains. Take a look to see if it got content.jar and artifacts.jar. If it does, it is an archived updated site. Install from it the same way as you install from a remote site.If the zip doesn\'t contain content.jar and artifacts.jar, go to your Eclipse install\'s dropins directory, create a subfolder (name doesn\'t matter) and expand your zip into that folder. Restart Eclipse.Note:but this is not important for the plugin,the most important is the folders features and pluginswhich contains the necessary xxx.jar,for example:\nHelp -> Install New Software -> Add -> Archivethen choose your .zip fileexample:for more detailed explanation, can refer my post:Summary methods of install Eclipse Plugin from .zipThis is the easiest way that I found to install a plugin locally at eclipse -The accepted answer from Konstantin worked, but there were a few additional steps. After restarting Eclipse, you still have to go into software updates, find your newly available software, check the box(es) for it, and click the "install" button. Then it\'ll prompt you to restart again and only then will you see your new views or functionality. Additionally, you can check the "Error Log" view for any problems with your new plugin that eclipse is complaining about. Seen here. You can unzip and\nClicking Local will prefix your location fith file:/C:/etc/folderYou can Click archive instead and select your zip, as suggested in the second popular question. It will prefix with jar://path.zip but it is not accepted by Eclipse itself. So, I used the plain folder solution.To install the plug-in, unzip the file into the Eclipse installation directory (or the plug-in directory depending on how the plug-in is packaged). The plug-in will not appear until you have restarted your workspace (Reboot Eclipse).If you are reading this because you are getting error while updating from the "Install new Software" menu, then you need to do thisplease note: add the suffix file:/// to the location \nex. file:///C:/Users/harry/Downloads/eclox/ Maybe not the best solution but this gets the work done :)Add to Criffan\'s answer,2.for valid Eclipse Plugin .zip file, you have two method to install it\n(1) auto installIn here when you are trying to install the plugin,sometimes it will give an error like Dialog appears when trying to add plugin we have to un tick group Items by Category in the details tab.Then it will work well.Download the plugin, extract it inside eclipse/dropins folder and restart your Eclipse IDE. You may require to pass --clean along with eclipse command
