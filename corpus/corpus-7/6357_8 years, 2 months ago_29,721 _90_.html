Inspired by Git for beginners: The definitive practical guide.This is a compilation of information on using Mercurial for beginners for practical use.Beginner - a programmer who has touched source control without understanding it very well.Practical - covering situations that the majority of users often encounter - creating a repository, branching, merging, pulling/pushing from/to a remote repository, etc.Notes:Questions:Ignore is configured in a normal text file called .hgignore in the root of your repository. Add it just like a normal file with:There are two syntax options available for file matching, glob and regexp. glob is unix-like filename expansion and regexp is regular expressions. You activate each by adding syntax: glob or syntax: regexp on a line by itself. All lines following that will use that syntax, until the next syntax marker. You can have as many syntax markers as you want. The default syntax is regexp, so if you only use regexp you don\'t need any syntax marker. You can add comments with #Example:Ignore only applies to unmanaged files (i.e. files that are not already checked in). To ignore files that are under version control, you can use the switches -I and -X.To see a list of files that have been changed:This will print each file that has been changed along with its status, which can include:To see the changes that have actually been made to the files:There are three ways:The convert extension will clone an existing Subversion repository into a Mercurial one.  It comes with Mercurial.  It works roughly like this:For example this will grab the trunk of the SixApart memcached repository.The extension can incrementally bring in new revisions from a Subversion repository into the Mercurial one (a little like pull).  However it does not support taking Mercurial revisions and sending them back to Subversion (no push).  [XXX: Correct this if it is wrong].The hgsubversion extension.  It is in many ways the most sophisticated solution as it uses the Subversion API to communicate with the Subversion repository.  It aims to become the hg-svn bridge.  It allow full round-tripping of revisions (full clone, pull, and push),  However as of this writing [XXX: Amend this if/when it becomes incorrect] it is still in development and there are not yet official releases.  As a consequence it works with only the most up-to-date Mercurial (1.3 as of this writing).It works like this:clone:OR (only for svn:// URLs)pull:push:incoming:outgoing:Checking out an entire repository:The hgsvn utility (bitbucket tree).  Up until recently this only let you clone and pull a Subversion repository, but as of hgsvn 0.1.7 it supports push.  [I do not know how well it does push.  Anyone with more experience should update this.]  It has the following notable features:It works like this:clone:pull:push:incoming:outgoing:Checking out an entire repository:Checking out just the trunk:Both use hg diff. When hg diff is used all changes in the working copy and the tip (the latest commit) is displayed.For "How do you compare two revisions of a file?"The above command will show different between rev1 and rev2 of "file.code".For "How do you compare your current file and a previous revision?"The above command will show different between the current version of "file.code" and the lastest revision (the lastest commited).:DYou can also clone your repository to create a special tag repository.$ hg branch my-branchor $ hg clone original-repository my-branchThough it should be noted that branch creates a "virtual" directory  (i.e., the files stay the same, but hg treats them as if they were different inside the system), while clone creates an actual, complete copy.  Strictly speaking, clone isn\'t branching.Invoke this command from the current local* mercurial repositoryaliases: ciWhere option can be:An example command would be:NOTES:Mercurial stores its configuration information in ~/.hgrc on *nix systems and in %UserProfile%\\mercurial.ini on Windows systems. (%UserProfile% is typically "C:\\Documents and Settings\\[username]\\" on Windows 2000 or Windows XP systems, and typically C:\\Users\\[username]\\ on Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems.)As a starting point, you should set your Mercurial username by placing the following in your .hgrc or mercurial.ini:TortoiseHg users on Windows systems can alternatively run hgtk userconfigSee also "Creating a Mercurial configuration file" in chapter 2 of "Mercurial: The Definitive Guide."Please edit nicely if you have installed from source  on Linux, or used the Windows installers.Use Python\'s easy_install (with Setuptools):This finds the latest version (1.3.1 at time of writing) and installs at:With Python 2.6 this also gets around the Mercurial OS X installer package (at 1.2.1 as of July 26 2009) complaining that it needs Python 2.5. From the documentation, it appears that Fink and Macports install version 1.2.Most of the explicit Linux packages appear to lag behind the current version, so use easy_install (as above) or download the Mercurial tarball, extract the archive, change to the mercurial directory, and run:(from Introducing Mercurial, a distributed version control system)There is a binary package of the latest version of Mercurial. TortoiseHg is a Windows shell extension for, and installs, Mercurial. Cygwin can also install Mercurial.Alternatively (instructions too lengthy so linked here), you can build an optimised or pure Python version of Mercurial from source.Mercurial remembers where a repository was cloned from (in .hg/hgrc) so you can simply run:to pull the latest code from origin-repository. (This does not update the working directory)to update the working directory.to perform both a pull and an update at once.Where option can be:Where source is the source of the original files located in the repository, where it can be a remote URL or a file system directory. For example: And destination is where the source code will be located in your local filesystem.Use hg outgoing to get the list of changesets that will be set to the default repository:To get the actual code changes, use -p (--patch). This will output each changeset in full:To remove a file from the repository, and have it deleted on the next commit:To remove a file from the repository, but not have it deletedor from Mercurial 1.3 From this question@van: If later you commit, you will effectively create a new branch. Then you might continue working only on this branch or eventually merge the existing one into it.A couple of options availableStep 1: Create a patch file to revert what changed between revision 107 and 108:(alternately, hg diff -r108 -r107 with no --reverse will do the same thing)Step 2: Apply the patch file:Some of the diff may fail to apply, for example:The .rej file will contain the contents of the diff that failed to apply, you\'ll need to have a look.To show the revision history of entire repository or filesorAnd to see the list in reverse orderEnable the \'transplant\' extension in your .hg/hgrcLoad the target branch then transplant the target revision.\neg: cherry pick revision 81 from branch \'foo\' into the current branchYou can then import this into another branch with:
