How do I write a loop in ruby so that I can execute a block of code on each file?I\'m new to ruby, and I\'ve concluded that the way to do this is a do each loop.\nThe ruby file will be executed from a different directory than the directory I want to loop through.I\'ve tried the Dir.foreach and I couldn\'t get it to work.As others have said, Dir.foreach is a good option here. However, note that Dir.entries and Dir.foreach will always show . and .. (the current and parent directories). You will generally not want to work on them, so you can do something like this:Dir.foreach and Dir.entries also show all items in the directory - hidden and non-hidden alike. Often this is what you want, but if it isn\'t, you need to do something to skip over the hidden files and directories.Alternatively, you might want to look into Dir.glob which provides simple wildcard matching:This is my favorite method for being easy to read:And you can even extend this to work on all files in subdirs:   Dir has also shorter syntax to get an array of all files from directory: The find library is designed for this task specifically:\nhttp://stdlib.rubyonrails.org/libdoc/find/rdoc/index.htmlThis is a standard ruby library, so it should be available
