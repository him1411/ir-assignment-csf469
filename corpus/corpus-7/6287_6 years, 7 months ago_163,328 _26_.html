I am trying to use find -exec with multiple commands without any success.  Does anybody know if commands such as the following are possible?Basically, I am trying to print the last line of each txt file in the current directory and print at the end of the line, a comma followed by the filename.find accepts multiple -exec portions to the command. For example:Note that in this case the second command will only run if the first one returns successfully, as mentioned by @Caleb. If you want both commands to run regardless of their success or failure, you could use this construct:One of the following:There\'s an easier way:Alternatively:I don\'t know if you can do this with find, but an alternate solution would be to create a shell script and to run this with find.lastline.sh:Make the script executableUse find:1st answer of Denis is the answer to resolve the trouble. But in fact it is no more a find with several commands in only one exec like the title suggest. To answer the one exec with several commands thing we will have to look for something else to resolv. Here is a example:Keep last 10000 lines of .log files which has been modified in the last 7 days using 1 exec command using severals {} references1) see what the command will do on which files:2) Do it: (note no more "\\>" but only ">" this is wanted)find / -name "*.log" -a -type f -a -mtime -7 -exec sh -c "tail -10000 {} > fictmp; cat fictmp > {} ; rm fictmp" \\;should use xargs :)another one (working on osx)Thanks to Camilo Martin, I was able to answer a related question:What I wanted to do was which didn\'t work. However, does work, so thank you!Another way is like this:in one lineIn this way multiple_cmd can be as long and as complex, as you need.Hope this helps.
