I have a bit of code that I need to run in a different thread than the GUI as it currently causes the form to freeze whilst the code runs (10 seconds or so). Assume I have never created a new thread before; what\'s a simple/basic example of how to do this in C# and using .NET Framework 2.0 or later? Good place to start reading is Joe Albahari.If you want to create your own thread, this is as simple as it gets:BackgroundWorker seems to be best choice for you. Here is my minimal example. After you click on the button the background worker will begin working in background thread and also report its progress simultaneously. It will also report after the work completes.Note: The ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem is pretty ideal for something simple. The only caveat is accessing a control from the other thread.Quick and dirty, but it will work:Using at top:simple code:I just threw this into a new console application for an exmapleTry using the BackgroundWorker class. You give it delegates for what to run, and to be notified when work has finished. There is an example on the MSDN page that I linked to.Here is another option:If you want to get a value:Put that code in a function (the code that can\'t be executed on the same thread as the GUI), and to trigger that code\'s execution put the following.Thread myThread= new Thread(nameOfFunction);workerThread.Start();Calling the start function on the thread object will cause the execution of your function call in a new thread.Charles your code(above) is not correct. You do not need to spin wait for completion. EndInvoke will block until the WaitHandle is signaled.If you want to block until completion you simply need to or alternatively But what is the point of issuing anyc calls if you block? You might as well just use a synchronous call. A better bet would be to not block and pass in a lambda for cleanup:One thing to keep in mind is that you must call EndInvoke. A lot of people forget this and end up leaking the WaitHandle as most async implementations release the waithandle in EndInvoke.If you are going to use the raw Thread object then you need to set IsBackground to true at a minimum and you should also set the Threading Apartment model (probably STA).I would recommend the BackgroundWorker class if you need UI interaction. Here how can use threads with a progressBar , its just for understing how the threads works, in the form there are three progressBar and 4 button:another option, that uses delegates and the Thread Pool... assuming \'GetEnergyUsage\' is a method that takes a DateTime and another DateTime as input arguments, and returns an Int...How to: Use a Background Thread to Search for FilesYou have to be very carefull with access from other threads to GUI specific stuff (it is common for many GUI toolkits). If you want to update something in GUI from processing thread check this answer that I think is useful for WinForms. For WPF see this (it shows how to touch component in UpdateProgress() method so it will work from other threads, but actually I don\'t like it is not doing CheckAccess() before doing BeginInvoke through Dispathcer, see and search for CheckAccess in it)Was looking .NET specific book on threading and found this one (free downloadable). See http://www.albahari.com/threading/ for more details about it.I believe you will find what you need to launch execution as new thread in first 20 pages and it has many more (not sure about GUI specific snippets I mean strictly specific to threading). Would be glad to hear what community thinks about this work \'cause I\'m reading this one. For now looked pretty neat for me (for showing .NET specific methods and types for threading). Also it covers .NET 2.0 (and not ancient 1.1) what I really appreciate.There are many ways of running separate threads in .Net, each has different behaviors. Do you need to continue running the thread after the GUI quits? Do you need to pass information between the thread and GUI? Does the thread need to update the GUI? Should the thread do one task then quit, or should it continue running? The answers to these questions will tell you which method to use.There is a good async method article at the Code Project web site that describes the various methods and provides sample code.I\'d recommend looking at Jeff Richter\'s Power Threading Library and specifically the IAsyncEnumerator. Take a look at the video on Charlie Calvert\'s blog where Richter goes over it for a good overview.Don\'t be put off by the name because it makes asynchronous programming tasks easier to code.
