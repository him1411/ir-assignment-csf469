I\'m encountering a problem sending files stored in a database back to the user in ASP.NET MVC. What I want is a view listing two links, one to view the file and let the mimetype sent to the browser determine how it should be handled, and the other to force a download.If I choose to view a file called SomeRandomFile.bak and the browser doesn\'t have an associated program to open files of this type, then I have no problem with it defaulting to the download behavior. However, if I choose to view a file called SomeRandomFile.pdf or SomeRandomFile.jpg I want the file to simply open. But I also want to keep a download link off to the side so that I can force a download prompt regardless of the file type. Does this make sense?I have tried FileStreamResult and it works for most files, it\'s constructor doesn\'t accept a filename by default, so unknown files are assigned the a file name based on the url (which does not know the extension to give based on content type). If I force the file name by specifying it, I lose the ability for the browser to open the file directly and I get a download prompt. Has anyone else encountered this.These are the examples of what I\'ve tried so far.Any suggestions?NOTE: This example code above fails to properly account for international characters in the filename. See RFC6266 for the relevant standardization. I believe recent versions of ASP.Net MVC\'s File() method and the ContentDispositionHeaderValue class properly accounts for this. - Oskar 2016-02-25I had trouble with the accepted answer due to no type hinting on the "document" variable: var document = ... So I\'m posting what worked for me as an alternative in case anybody else is having trouble.Darin Dimitrov\'s answer is correct. Just an addition: Response.AppendHeader("Content-Disposition", cd.ToString()); may cause the browser to fail rendering the file if your response already contains a "Content-Disposition" header. In that case, you may want to use:To view file (txt for example):To download file (txt for example):note: to download file we should pass fileDownloadName argumentFileVirtualPath --> Research\\Global Office Review.pdfI believe this answer is cleaner, (based on\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/3007668/550975)
