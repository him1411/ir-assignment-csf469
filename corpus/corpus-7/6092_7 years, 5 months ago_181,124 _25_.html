I\'ve seen plenty of info about how to stream video from the server to an android device, but not much about the other way, ala Qik.  Could someone point me in the right direction here, or give me some advice on how to approach this?I have hosted a open source project to enabling Android phone to IP camera:http://code.google.com/p/ipcamera-for-android The raw video data is fetched from LocalSocket, and the MDAT MOOV of MP4 was checked first before streaming. The live video is packed as FLV format, and can be played via Flash video player with a build in web server :)Took me some time, but I finally manage do make an app that does just that. Check out the google code page if you\'re interested: http://code.google.com/p/spydroid-ipcamera/\nI added loads of comments in my code (mainly, look at CameraStreamer.java), so it should be pretty self-explanatory.\nThe hard part was actually to understand the RFC 3984 and implement a proper algorithm for the packetization process. (This algorithm actually turns the mpeg4/h.264 stream produced by the MediaRecorder into a nice rtp stream, according to the rfc)ByeI\'m looking into this as well, and while I don\'t have a good solution for you I did manage to dig up SIPDroid\'s video code:http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/source/browse/trunk/src/org/sipdroid/sipua/ui/VideoCamera.java I\'ve built an open-source SDK called Kickflip to make streaming video from Android a painless experience.  The SDK demonstrates use of Android 4.3\'s MediaCodec API to direct the device hardware encoder\'s packets directly to FFmpeg for RTMP (with librtmp) or HLS streaming of H.264 / AAC. It also demonstrates realtime OpenGL Effects (titling, chroma key, fades) and background recording.Thanks SO, and especially, fadden.Here is complete article about streaming android camera video to a webpage.Android Streaming Live Camera Video to Web PageI am able to send the live camera video from mobile to my server.using this link\n  see the linkRefer the above link.there is a sample application in that link. Just you need to set your service url in RecordActivity.class.Example as:\n ffmpeg_link="rtmp://yourserveripaddress:1935/live/venkat";we can able to send H263 and H264 type videos using that link.This is hardly a full answer, but webRTC may be what you\'re looking for. Here\'s some quick examples of webRTC in action: http://www.webrtc.org/reference-appsIf you want Android specific code, it exists! http://www.webrtc.org/native-code/androidCheck Yasea libraryYasea is an Android streaming client. It encodes YUV and PCM data from\n  camera and microphone to H.264/AAC, encapsulates in FLV and transmits\n  over RTMP.Feature:Depending by your budget, you can use a  Raspberry Pi Camera that can send images to a server. I add here two tutorials where you can find many more details:This tutorial show you how to use a Raspberry Pi Camera and display images on Android deviceThis is the second tutorial where you can find a series of tutorial about real-time video streaming between camera and android device
