I can\'t connect to my device anymore using ADB through the command line or in Eclipse.Running the commandreturns the device name, but it says it\'s offline.Things I\'ve tried.I really don\'t have any clue what\'s going on. Anything else you think I can try, I\'m all ears.To be clear, if you\'re having this same issue the problem is probably an out-of-date SDK. As of 4.2.2 there is a security feature that requires you to confirm the RSA fingerprint of the connecting device. Open the SDK manager and update the tools! Then reboot.I just got the same problem today after my Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus were updated to Android 4.2.2.The thing that fixed it for me was to upgrade the SDK platform-tools to r16.0.1. For me, this version was not displayed in my SDK Manager, so I pulled it down from http://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r16.0.1-windows.zip directly.You then need to rename the platform-tools directory and unzip it to android-sdk-windows/platform-tools. Using the SDK Manager, I had also updated to the latest sdk-tools before this.If your whole Eclipse and ADT are ancient, you may need to update them as well, but I didn\'t need to.Note: you may need to run SDK Manager twice (once to update itself) before you will see the latest packages.Try running adb devices after running adb kill-server. Security question pops up after that. Worked for me.I hit the same issue on a Nexus 7 running 4.2.2 OTA update. I\'m almost certain I had an ADB connection over USB and Wi-Fi after the update until it just stopped working. To fix, I updated my SDK using: Now my development tools are:It also seems to occur frequently when you connect to the device using the Wi-Fi mode (in Android Studio or in the console by running adb tcpip 5555 for example).To fix:For anyone wondering about 4.2.2, there is a security question that appears on the phone requesting RSA verification with the PC. Be sure your tools are updated AND you allow the PC access by verifying the security question on the devices in question. This fixed it for me.And as always, verify you have debugging enabled in the developer options ;)I can\'t stress that switching USB ports is key.  Often front panel USB ports can be defective.Multiple adb.exe files ?My problem was solved when deleted a copy of OLD adb.exe from C:/Windows/.\nI don\'t know how a copy of adb.exe got to the C:\\Windows\\ ?When I launch adb.exe from android-sdk/platform-tools/ I had no problem with detection.I was having this problem and none of the other answers helped. What was necessary, after updating the SDK and installing the API for 4.2.2, was running:Another problem I was having was that I was trying to connect ADB over Wi-Fi, which is my only option because the USB ports on my Mac are really finnicky. Unfortunately, ADB over Wi-Fi doesn\'t show the security question in 4.2.2, so you need to find a USB cable that\'ll work and connect over USB at least once to accept the security question, but after you do that once, you can connect over Wi-Fi.Be sure to use adb from your platform-tools folder, after updating the SDK tools.I finally got this working after I realized I was using an outdated version of ADB copied in /usr/bin.If your device normally connects over USB, but suddenly stops working, especially after the USB cable has been disconnected and reconnected, try the following non-invasive steps before doing some of the more drastic things mentioned in the other answers:If your device is listed with \'device\' next to it, you\'re back in business.If your device is listed with \'offline\' next to it, try restarting the device. The ADB daemon on the device will occasionally get hung. I\'ve noticed this more when I\'ve disconnected the cable while LogCat is running and after switching back from connecting via Wi-Fi or Ethernet.If your device isn\'t listed then you should try the solutions in the other answers, starting with trying a different USB cable and port. Those cheapo cables can go bad.Try by turning off usb debugging once and then enabling it agin and then connect your device with system: linkSometime this may happen because of adb server error (i think). It always saying Just kill server and start again. It worked for me.I used adb connect <device_ip> and non of the other solutions worked because my problem was on the other side. On the device I needed to stop adbd and restart it start adbd. Device is now "online" again.I tried dturvene and all the other solutions, but they didn\'t work. I needed one more step. Run these commandsTo verify that it worked, run \'adb version\' before and after the commands and make sure it is the latest. The reason for the adb kill-server command is that it it most likely running, and it can\'t be updated while it is running, so you have to kill it first.I initially encountered the same problem (with ADB/fastboot downloaded from GitHub), but I eventually got it to work. What worked for me:For me nothing worked. I spent about 12 hours constantly searching on the Internet and trying the solutions that worked for other people having similar issues. Finally I ended up with just doing the ADB stuff over the LAN. The setting was right next to the USB Debug setting and in ADB it can be activated with "adb connect [IPADDRESS]:[PORT]". The port was 5555 on my phone.I hope this helps someone to get back to work instead of having to deal with constant drawbacks.If you\'ve previously authorized the RSA fingerprint of your PC and tried adb kill-server etc. with no luck, your problem might just be that you\'re trying to connect to it while it\'s locked. Try pressing the screen-on button and entering your pattern - this fixed it for me.The best way I figured is by disabling and then enabling the device from Device Manager and running the adb devices command.The device will be back online. It\'s faster.This approach worked for me:Device Manager, "View" menu, "Devices by Connection":It\'s just because your computer doesn\'t have the right driver. To fix that:Download and extract Android SDK Go to Device Manager (Right Click on Computer --> Properties --> Device ManagerOn the right pane expand portable devices to find your deviceRight click on your device name and click Update Driver SoftwareBrowse my computer for driver softwareBrowse to your Android SDK folder on step 1.Next and you\'re doneTry to restart the adb server as follows:I have also came across the same problems as yours. And restarting the adb server will resolve this problem.I updated many times, until I couldn\'t update any more, but I never got a prompt on my screen; I just kept getting the device offline.My problem was that I was running the ADB command from a different directory to what was actually being updated.The correct updated directory for the ADB exe is:One more possibility for people with flaky ADB connections, and if they\'re on a Mac and have Android File Transfer installed: I found that file transfer was interfering with my ADB connection, causing it to stop working intermittently. Killing the Android File Transfer Agent.app process that looks for compatible devices (for example, the Nexus 7) being connected to the Mac cures the flakiness for me.Restart the device. I tried everything listed here to get my HTC phone (running Android 4.0.3) working, but adb devices kept saying it was offline. After I restarted the phone, it was finally online. Some of the other suggestions here may have contributed to the phone being recognized, but doing a few restarts along the way as you\'re trying them out certainly won\'t hurt.late but I found the easiest way\njust go to DDMS and follow as shown in image...As nobody gave an answer for my situation: you may not have access to the ~/.android/adbkey file. If you initially start adb with sudo, it will generate a public key pair, writing this to ~/.android/adbkey.pub and ~/android/adbkey. Of course, the private key is chmod 600 - only readable for root in your home directory. Subsequently starting adb as normal user will give no access to the private key file, which in turn will fail silently with "device offline".What solved for me on Mac was updating adb to the latest version (1.0.32). Now i can see my device online againInstalled the latest android sdk.\nChanged the USB port of the device.\nChanged from MTP -> Charge only -> MTP.\nIt worked.After trying everything two times, I rolled back the phone software to a stable build, and it finally worked. I was running Cyanogen nightlies. Regardless, the things posted in this thread should help anyone who encounters this problem.I encountered this problem as well. I updated everything I could in the Android SDK Manager, uninstalled my device using Device Manager, and now it works correctly. I issues a few "kill-server" and "start-server" along the way...
