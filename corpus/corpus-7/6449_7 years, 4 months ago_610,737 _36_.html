I see something strange like: http://github.com/zoul/Finch.gitNow I\'m not that CVS, SVN, etc. dude. When I open that in the browser it tells me that I did something wrong. So I bet I need some hacker-style tool? Some client?(I mean... why not just provide a ZIP file? Isn\'t the world complex enough?)Please Note: This is deprecated as of September 2013. See revised answer here.Have a read through http://help.github.com/To clone that repository via a URL like that: yes, you do need a client, and that client is Git. That will let you make changes, your own branches, merge back in sync with other developers, maintain your own source that you can easily keep up to date without downloading the whole thing each time and writing over your own changes etc. A ZIP file won\'t let you do that.It is mostly meant for people who want to develop the source rather than people who just want to get the source one off and not make changes.But it just so happens you can get a ZIP file as well:Click on http://github.com/zoul/Finch/ and then click on the ZIP button just to the left of the repository URL field. See here:What happens when the repository owner has not prepared a zip file, and you just want a download to use yourself? There is an answer and you don\'t need to go though that horrid process to download software, install and register keys and whatnot on GitHub, etc.!To simply download a repository as a zip file: add the extra path \'/zipball/master/\' to the end of the repository URL and voila, it gives you a zip file of the whole lot.For example,http://github.com/zoul/Finch/becomes:http://github.com/zoul/Finch/zipball/master/It then gives you a zip file to download.Updated July 2016As of July 2016, the Download ZIP button has moved under  Clone or download  to extreme-right of header under the Code tab:If you don\'t see the button: http://github.com/user/repository/\n-to->\nhttp://github.com/user/repository/archive/master.zipto get the master branch source code in a zip file. You can do the same with tags and branch names, by replacing master in the URL above with the name of the branch or tag.To download your repository as zip file via curl:If your repository is private:Source: Github HelpAs of December 2016, the Clone or download button is still under the <> Code tab, however it is now to the far right of the header:Here\'s a good reference if you want to do it from the command line:\nhttp://linuxprograms.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/checkout-code-from-github/Basically it\'s I\'ve been stumped by this too. The "Download" button is to the far right, but you also need to be in the top folder in order to download what you\'re seeing. Go up as high as you can to the parent/root folder and then look for the download button.Sometimes if the \'Download ZIP\' button is not available, you can click on \'Raw\' and the file should download to your system.As of June 2016, the Download ZIP button is still under the <> Code tab, however it is now inside a button with two options clone or download:Symfony image exampleI was facing same problem but accidentlty I sorted this problem.\n1) Login in github\n2) Click on Fork Button at Top Right.\n3) After above step you can see Clone or download in Green color under <> Code Tab.
