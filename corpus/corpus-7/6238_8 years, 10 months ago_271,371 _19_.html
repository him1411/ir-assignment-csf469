Is there an obvious way to do this that I\'m missing?  I\'m just trying to make thumbnails.Define a maximum size.\nThen, compute a resize ratio by taking min(maxwidth/width, maxheight/height).The proper size is oldsize*ratio.There is of course also a library method to do this: the method Image.thumbnail.\nBelow is an (edited) example from the PIL documentation.This script will resize an image (somepic.jpg) using PIL (Python Imaging Library) to a width of 300 pixels and a height proportional to the new width. It does this by determining what percentage 300 pixels is of the original width (img.size[0]) and then multiplying the original height (img.size[1]) by that percentage. Change "basewidth" to any other number to change the default width of your images.I also recommend using PIL\'s thumbnail method, because it removes all the ratio hassles from you.One important hint, though: Replacewithby default, PIL uses the Image.NEAREST filter for resizing which results in good performance, but poor quality.Based in @tomvon, I finished using the following:Resizing width:Resizing height:Then just:PIL already has the option to crop an imageIf you are trying to maintain the same aspect ratio, then wouldn\'t you resize by some percentage of the original size?For example, half the original sizeI use this library:My ugly example.Function get file like: "pic[0-9a-z].[extension]", resize them to 120x120, moves section to center and save to "ico[0-9a-z].[extension]", works with portrait and landscape:
