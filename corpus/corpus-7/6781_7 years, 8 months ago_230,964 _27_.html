Is it possible to reload an image with an identical file name from a server using jQuery?For example, I have an image on a page, however, the physical image can change based on user actions. Note, this does not mean the file name changes, but the actual file itself.ie:Regardless of how often the code below is called, the same issue persists.In the jQuery documentation, the "load" function would be perfect if it had a default method of firing the event as opposed to binding a callback function to a successful/complete load of an element.Any assistance is greatly appreciated.It sounds like it\'s your browser caching the image (which I now notice you wrote in your question). You can force the browser to reload the image by passing an extra variable like so:It\'s probably not the best way, but I\'ve solved this problem in the past by simply appending a timestamp to the image URL using JavaScript:Next time it loads, the timestamp is set to the current time and the URL is different, so the browser does a GET for the image instead of using the cached version.This could be one of the two problems you mention yourself. To be honest, I think it\'s number two. Would be a lot easier if we could see some more jQuery. But for a start, try remove the attribute first, and then set it again. Just to see if that helps:Even if this works, post some code since this is not optimal, imo :-)with one line with no worries about hardcoding the image src into the javascript (thanks to jeerose for the ideas:To bypass caching and avoid adding infinite timestamps to the image url, strip the previous timestamp before adding a new one, this is how I\'ve done it. This works great! however if you reload the src multiple times, the timestamp gets concatenated to the url too. I\'ve modified the accepted answer to deal with that.Have you tried resetting the image containers html. Of course if it\'s the browser that is caching then this wouldn\'t help.Some times actually solution like -also not refresh src properly, try out this, it worked for me ->My images are kept in a "hidden" folder above "www" so that only logged users are allowed access to them. For this reason I cannot use the ordinary <img src=/somefolder/1023.jpg> but I send requests to the server like <img src=?1023> and it responds by sending back the image kept under name \'1023\'.The application is used for image cropping, so after an ajax request to crop the image, it is changed as content on the server but keeps its original name. In order to see the result of the cropping, after the ajax request has been completed, the first image is removed from the DOM and a new image is inserted with the same name <img src=?1023>.To avoid cashing I add to the request the "time" tag prepended with "#" so it becomes like <img src=?1023#1467294764124>. The server automatically filters out the hash part of the request and responds correctly by sending back my image kept as \'1023\'. Thus I always get the last version of the image without much server-side decoding.Based on @kasper Taeymans\' answer.If u simply need reload image (not replace it\'s src with smth new), try:I simply do this in html:And reload the image in code behind like this:}
