I would like to add a custom header to an AJAX POST request from jQuery.I have tried this: When I send this request and I watch with FireBug, I see this header: OPTIONS xxxx/yyyy HTTP/1.1\n      Host: 127.0.0.1:6666\n      User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:11.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/11.0\n      Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,/;q=0.8\n      Accept-Language: fr,fr-fr;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3\n      Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n      Connection: keep-alive\n      Origin: null\n      Access-Control-Request-Method: POST\n      Access-Control-Request-Headers: my-first-header,my-second-header\n      Pragma: no-cache\n      Cache-Control: no-cacheWhy do my custom headers go to Access-Control-Request-Headers: Access-Control-Request-Headers: my-first-header,my-second-headerI was expecting a header values like this: My-First-Header: first value\n     My-Second-Header: second valueIs it possible?What you saw in Firefox was not the actual request; note that the HTTP method is OPTIONS, not POST.  It was actually the \'pre-flight\' request that the browser makes to determine whether a cross-domain AJAX request should be allowed:http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/The Access-Control-Request-Headers header in the pre-flight request includes the list of headers in the actual request.  The server is then expected to report back whether these headers are supported in this context or not, before the browser submits the actual request.Here is an example how to set a Request Header in a JQuery Ajax Call:This code below works for me. I always use only single brackets, and it works fine. I suggest you should use only single brackets OR only double brackets, but not mixed up.Hope this answers your question...and that is why you can\'t create a bot with javascript, because your options are limited to what the browser allows you to do. you can\'t just order a browser that follows CORS policy - which is followed by all the known browsers-  to send random requests to other origins and allow you to get the response that simply!.and if you tried to edit some request headers manually like origin header from the developers tools that come with the browsers , the browser will refuse your edit, and may send a preflight OPTIONS requestTry to use rack-cors gem. And add the header field in your ajax call.
