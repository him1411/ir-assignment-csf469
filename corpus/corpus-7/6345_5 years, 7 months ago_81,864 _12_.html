I have a simple script where the first argument is reserved for the filename, and all other optional arguments should be passed to other parts of the script.Using Google I found this wiki, but it provided a literal example:I can\'t get anything else to work, like:orI get "Bad substitution" from the terminal.What is the problem, and how can I process all but the first argument passed to a bash script?Use this:The following syntax:would work as well, but is not recommended, because as @Gordon already explained, that using *, it runs all of the arguments together as a single argument with spaces, while @ preserves the breaks between them (even if some of the arguments themselves contain spaces). It doesn\'t make the difference with echo, but it matters for many other commands.If you want a solution that also works in /bin/sh tryhttp://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/posparamsIt explains the use of shift (if you want to discard the first N parameters) and then implementing Mass Usage (look for the heading with that title).
