I\'m trying to replace a character at a specific index in a string. What I\'m doing is:This gives an error.  Is there any method to do this?String are immutable in Java. You can\'t change them.You need to create a new string with the character replaced.Or you can use a StringBuilder:Turn the String into a char[], replace the letter by index, then convert the array back into a String.String is an immutable class in java any methods which seem to modify it always return a new string object with modification.\nif you want to manipulate a string consider StringBuilder or StringBuffer in case you require thread safetyI agree with Petar Ivanov but it is best if we implement in following way:As previously answered here, String instances are immutable. StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable and suitable for such a purpose whether you need to be thread safe or not.There is however a way to modify a String but I would never recommend it because it is unsafe, unreliable and it can can be considered as cheating : you can use reflection to modify the inner char array the String object contains. Reflection allows you to access fields and methods that are normally hidden in the current scope (private methods or fields from another class...).You can overwrite a string, as follows:  Note that the string myName occurs on both lines, and on both sides of the second line.  Therefore, even though strings may technically be immutable, in practice, you can treat them as editable by overwriting them.First thing I should have noticed is that charAt is a method and assigning value to it using equal sign won\'t do anything. If a string is immutable, charAt method, to make change to the string object must receive an argument containing the new character. Unfortunately, string is immutable. To modify the string, I needed to use StringBuilder as suggested by Mr. Petar Ivanov.this will workOutput : domaxokz
