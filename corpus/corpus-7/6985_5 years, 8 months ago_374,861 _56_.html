I have an HTML table of rows tied to database rows.  I\'d like to have a "delete row" link for each row, but I would like to confirm with the user beforehand. Is there any way to do this using the Twitter bootstrap modal dialog?For this task you can use already available plugins and bootstrap extensions. Or you can make your own confirmation popup with just 3 lines of code. Check it out.Say we have this links (note data-href instead of href) or buttons that we want to have delete confirmation for:Here #confirm-delete points to a modal popup div in your HTML. It should have an "OK" button configured like this:Now you only need this little javascript to make a delete action confirmable:So on show.bs.modal event delete button href is set to URL with corresponding record id.Demo: http://plnkr.co/edit/NePR0BQf3VmKtuMmhVR7?p=previewI realize that in some cases there might be needed to perform POST or DELETE request rather then GET. It it still pretty simple without too much code. Take a look at the demo below with this approach:Demo: http://plnkr.co/edit/V4GUuSueuuxiGr4L9LmG?p=previewHere is an original version of the code I made when I was answering this question for Bootstrap 2.3 modal.Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/MjmVr/1595/http://bootboxjs.com/ - latest works with Bootstrap 3.0.0The simplest possible example:From the site:The library exposes three methods designed to mimic their native JavaScript equivalents. Their exact method signatures are flexible as each can take various parameters to customise labels and specify defaults, but they are most commonly called like so:Here\'s a snippet of it in action (click "Run code snippet" below):I\'d realise its a very old question, but since i wondered today for a more efficient method of handling the bootstrap modals. I did some research and found something better then the solutions which are shown above, that can be found at this link:http://www.petefreitag.com/item/809.cfmFirst load the jqueryThen just ask any question/confirmation to href:This way the confirmation modal is a lot more universal and so it can easily be re-used on other parts of your website.Thanks to @Jousby\'s solution, I managed to get mine working as well, but found I had to improve his solution\'s Bootstrap modal markup a bit to make it render correctly as demonstrated in the official examples.So, here\'s my modified version of the generic confirm function that worked fine:I found this useful and easy to use, plus it looks pretty: http://maxailloud.github.io/confirm-bootstrap/.To use it, include the .js file in your page then run:There are various options you can apply to it, to make it look better when doing it to confirm a delete, I use:I can easily handle this type of task using bootbox.js library. At first you need to include bootbox JS file. Then in your event handler function simply write following code:Offical bootboxjs siteFollowing solution is better than bootbox.js, becausedigimango.messagebox.js:To use digimango.messagebox.js:When its comes to a relevantly big project we may need something re-usable. This is something I came with with help of SO.Note: This uses http delete method for delete request, you can change it from javascript or, can send it using a data-attribute as in data-title or data-url etc, for support any request.If you want to do it in the easiest shortcut, then u can do it with this plugin.But this plugin is an alternate implementation using Bootstrap Modal. And real Bootstrap implementation is also very easy, so I don\'t like to use this plugin because it adds excess JS contents in the page, which will slow down the page loading time.I like to implement it by myself by this way-Then in the pop-up, there will be 2 buttons for confirmation.The code will be like this (using Bootstrap)-You should change the form action according to your requirement.Happy coading :)You can try more reusable my solution with callback function. In this function you can use POST request or some logic.\nUsed libraries: JQuery 3> and Bootstrap 3>.https://jsfiddle.net/axnikitenko/gazbyv8v/Html code for test:Javascript:dfsq\'s answer is very nice. I modified it a bit to fit my needs: I actually needed a modal for the case that, after clicking, the user would also be navigated to the corresponding page. Executing the query asynchronously is not always what one needs.Using Blade I created the file resources/views/includes/confirmation_modal.blade.php:Now, using it is straight-forward:Not much changed here and the modal can be included like this:Just by putting the verb in there, it uses it. This way, CSRF is also utilized.Helped me, maybe it helps someone else.
