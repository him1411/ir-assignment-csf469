Consider this code:Are there any other ways to insert the value of a variable in to a string, apart from string concatenation?Use ECMAScript 2015\'s Template String Literals, if applicable.There is no direct way to do it, as per ECMAScript 5 specifications, but ECMAScript 6 has template strings, which were also known as quasi-literals during the drafting of the spec. Use them like this:You can use any valid JavaScript expression inside the {}. For example:The other important thing is, you don\'t have to worry about multi-line strings anymore. You can write them simply asNote: I used io.js v2.4.0 to evaluate all the template strings shown above. You can also use the latest Chrome to test the above shown examples.Note: ES6 Specifications are now finalized, but have yet to be implemented by all major browsers. According to the Mozilla Developer Network pages, this will be implemented for basic support starting in the following versions: Firefox 34, Chrome 41, Internet Explorer 12. If you\'re an Opera, Safari, or Internet Explorer user and are curious about this now, this test bed can be used to play around until everyone gets support for this.Douglas Crockford\'s Remedial JavaScript includes a String.prototype.supplant function.  It is short, familiar, and easy to use:If you don\'t want to change String\'s prototype, you can always adapt it to be standalone, or place it into some other namespace, or whatever.Since ES6, you can just write:Word of caution: avoid any template system which does\'t allow you to escape its own delimiters. For example, There would be no way to output the following using the supplant() method mentioned here."I am 3 years old thanks to my {age} variable."Simple interpolation may work for small self-contained scripts, but often comes with this design flaw that will limit any serious use.  I honestly prefer DOM templates, such as:And use jQuery manipulation: $(\'#age\').text(3)Alternately, if you are simply just tired of string concatenation, there\'s always alternate syntax:Try sprintf. For example:You could use Prototype\'s template system if you really feel like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut:I use this pattern in a lot of languages when I don\'t know how to do it properly yet and just want to get an idea down quickly:While not particularily efficient, I find it readable. It always works, and its always available:ALWAYSUPDATE: I have updated the javascript version to replace all occurances rather than just the first one.You can do easily using ES6 template string and transpile to ES5 using any available transpilar like babel.http://www.es6fiddle.net/im3c3euc/Try kiwi, a light-weight JavaScript module for string interpolation.You can doorHere\'s a solution which requires you to provide an object with the values. If you don\'t provide an object as parameter, it will default to using global variables. But better stick to using the parameter, it\'s much cleaner.Another sledgehammer: jquery-tmpl (templating with jQuery).Expanding on Greg Kindel\'s second answer, you can write a function to eliminate some of the boilerplate:Usage:If you want to interpolate in console.log output, then justHere, %s is what is called a "format specifier". console.log has this sort of interpolation support built-in.use ` (Grave accent) instead of single quote(\') or double quote(") and ${ your-varialbe }eg. current date: ${new Date()}
