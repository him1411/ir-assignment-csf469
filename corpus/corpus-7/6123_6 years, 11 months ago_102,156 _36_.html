I am just beginning to start learning web application development, using python. I am coming across the terms \'cookies\' and \'sessions\'. I understand cookies in that they store some info in a key value pair on the browser. But I have a little confusion regarding sessions, in a session too we store data in a cookie on the user\'s browser.For example - I login using username=\'rasmus\' and password=\'default\'. In such a case the data will be posted to the server which is supposed to check and log me in if authenticated. However during the entire process the server also generates a session ID which will be stored in a cookie on my browser. Now the server also stores this session ID in its file system or datastore. But based on just the session ID, how would it be able to know my username during my subsequent traversal through the site? Does it store the data on the server as a dict where the key would be a session ID and details like username, email etc. be the values?I am getting quite confused here. Need help.Because HTTP is stateless, in order to associate a request to any other request, you need a way to store user data between HTTP requests.  Cookies or URL parameters ( for ex. like http://example.com/myPage?asd=lol&boo=no ) are both suitable ways to transport data between 2 or more request.\nHowever they are not good in case you don\'t want that data to be readable/editable on client side.The solution is to store that data server side, give it an "id", and let the client only know (and pass back at every http request) that id. There you go, sessions implemented. Or you can use the client as a convenient remote storage, but you would encrypt the data and keep the secret server-side.Of course there are other aspects to consider, like you don\'t want people to hijack other\'s sessions, you want sessions to not last forever but to expire, and so on.In your specific example, the user id (could be username or another unique ID in your user database) is stored in the session data, server-side, after successful identification. Then for every HTTP request you get from the client, the session id (given by the client) will point you to the correct session data (stored by the server) that contains the authenticated user id - that way your code will know what user it is talking to."Session" is the term used to refer to a user\'s time browsing a web site. It\'s meant to represent the time between their first arrival at a page in the site until the time they stop using the site. In practice, it\'s impossible to know when the user is done with the site. In most servers there\'s a timeout that automatically ends a session unless another page is requested by the same user.The first time a user connects some kind of session ID is created (how it\'s done depends on the web server software and the type of authentication/login you\'re using on the site). \nLike cookies, this usually doesn\'t get sent in the URL anymore because it\'s a security problem. Instead it\'s stored along with a bunch of other stuff that collectively is also referred to as the session. Session variables are like cookies - they\'re name-value pairs sent along with a request for a page, and returned with the page from the server - but their names are defined in a web standard.Some session variables are passed as HTTP headers. They\'re passed back and forth behind the scenes of every page browse so they don\'t show up in the browser and tell everybody something that may be private. Among them are the USER_AGENT, or type of browser requesting the page, the REFERRER or the page that linked to the page being requested, etc. Some web server software adds their own headers or transfer additional session data specific to the server software. But the standard ones are pretty well documented.Hope that helps.Explanation by analogyImagine you are in a bank, trying to get some money out of your account. But the bank is pitch black - there\'s no light and you can\'t see your hand in front of your face - and you are surrounded by another 20 people. They all look the same. And everybody has the same voice. In other words, HTTP is stateless.This bank is a funny type of bank - for the sake of argument here\'s how things work:  But how will the teller tell you apart from everyone else? The teller can\'t see or readily recognise you, remember, because the lights are all out. What if your teller gives your $10,000 withdrawal to someone else - the wrong person? You\'d be pretty annoyed, i\'m guessing?Solution:When you first appear to the teller, he or she tells you something in secret: "when ever you are talking to me," says the teller, "you should first identify yourlself as GNASHEU329 - that way I know it\'s you".Nobody else knows the secret passcode. So I decide to go to and chill out for 20 minutes and then later i go to the teller and say "i\'d like to collect my withdrawal"The teller asks me: "who are you!""It\'s me, Mr George Banks!""Prove it!"And then I tell them my passcode: GNASHEU329 "Certainly Mr Banks!"That basically is how a session works. It allows one to be uniquely identified in a sea of millions of people. You need to identify yourself every time you deal with the teller.Hope that make sense for you. If you got any questions or are unclear - please post comment and i will try to clear it up for you.HTTP is stateless connection protocol, that is, the server cannot differentiate between different connections of different users. Hence comes cookie, once a client connects first time to a server, the server generates a new session id, which later will be sent to the client as cookie value. And from now on, this session id will identify that client connection, because within each HTTP request it will see the appropriate session id inside cookies. Now for each session id, the server keeps some data structure, which enables him to store data specific to user, this data structure you can abstractly call session.Think of HTTP as a person(A) who has SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS and forgets every person as soon as that person goes out of sight.Now, to remember different persons, A takes a photo of that person and keeps it. Each Person\'s pic has an ID number. When that person comes again in sight, that person tells it\'s ID number to A and A finds their picture by ID number.\nAnd voila !!, A knows who is that person.Same is with HTTP. It is suffering from SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS. It uses Sessions to record everything you did while using a website, and then, when you come again, it identifies you with the help of Cookies(Cookie is like a token).\nPicture is the Session here, and ID is the Cookie here.Here is an article explaining How does user session recording work.It\'s more about debugging user sessions (including XHR HTTP user sessions).
