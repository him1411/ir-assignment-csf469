I have the below JavaScript syntax:This rounds up to the whole number, how can I return the result with two decimal places?NOTE - See Edit 2 if 3 digit precision is importanttoFixed will round up or down for you depending on the values beyond 2 decimals.Example: http://jsfiddle.net/calder12/tv9HY/Documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixedEdit - As mentioned by others this converts the result to a string. To avoid this:Edit 2- As also mentioned in the comments this function fails in some precision, in the case of 1.005 for example it will return 1.00 instead of 1.01. If accuracy to this degree is important I\'ve found this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32605063/1726511 Which seems to work well with all the tests I\'ve tried.There is one minor modification required though, the function in the answer linked above returns whole numbers when it rounds to one, so for example 99.004 will return 99 instead of 99.00 which isn\'t ideal for displaying prices.Edit 3 - Seems having the toFixed on the actual return was STILL screwing up some numbers, this final edit appears to work. Geez so many reworks!See Fiddle example here: https://jsfiddle.net/calder12/3Lbhfy5s/If you use a unary plus to convert a string to a number as documented on MDN.For example:+discount.toFixed(2)The functions Math.round() and .toFixed() is meant to round to the nearest integer and you may get some unwanted errors when dealing with decimals, and using the "multiply and divide" method for Math.round() or parameter for .toFixed(). For example, if you try to round 1.005 using Math.round(1.005 * 100) / 100 then you\'ll get the result of 1, and 1.00 using .toFixed(2) instead of getting the correct answer of 1.01.You can use following to solve this issue:Add .toFixed(2) to get the two decimal places you wanted.You could make a function that will handle the rounding for you:Example:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/k5tpq3pd/36/AlternativYou can add a round function to Number using prototype. I would not suggest adding .toFixed() here as it would return a string instead of number.and use it like this:Example\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/k5tpq3pd/35/Source: http://www.jacklmoore.com/notes/rounding-in-javascript/To get the result with two decimals, you can do like this :The value to be rounded is multiplied by 100 to keep the first two digits, then we divide by 100 to get the actual result.try using discount.toFixed(2);A small variation on the accepted answer.\ntoFixed(2) returns a string, and you will always get two decimal places. These might be zeros. If you would like to suppress final zero(s), simply do this:Edited:\nI\'ve just discovered what seems to be a bug in Firefox 35.0.1, which means that the above may give NaN with some values.\nI\'ve changed my code to This gives a number with up to two decimal places. If you wanted three, you would multiply and divide by 1000, and so on.\nThe OP wants two decimal places always, but if toFixed() is broken in Firefox it needs fixing first.\nSee https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1134388Fastest Way - faster than toFixed(): The best and simple solution I found isReference:\nhttp://www.jacklmoore.com/notes/rounding-in-javascript/I think the best way I\'ve seen it done is multiplying by 10 to the power of the number of digits, then doing a Math.round, then finally dividing by 10 to the power of digits. Here is a simple function I use in typescript:Or plain javascript:To handle rounding to any number of decimal places, a function with 2 lines of code will suffice for most needs.  Here\'s some sample code to play with.Here is a working example
