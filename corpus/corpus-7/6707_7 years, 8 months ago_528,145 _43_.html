Follow up question to this post:For now I have a slight idea about the differences between SOAP and RESTful Services. My question is when I should use SOAP, and when I should use RESTful; which one is "better" when it comes to performance/speed or request handling?I\'m implementing for the first time in RESTful(java) and I want know more about it; I\'ve dealt with SOAP before.REST is almost always going to be faster.  The main advantage of SOAP is that it provides a mechanism for services to describe themselves to clients, and to advertise their existence.  REST is much more lightweight and can be implemented using almost any tool, leading to lower bandwidth and shorter learning curve.  However, the clients have to know what to send and what to expect.In general, When you\'re publishing an API to the outside world that is either complex or likely to change, SOAP will be more useful.  Other than that, REST is usually the better option.REST vs SOAP Web ServicesI am seeing a lot of new web services are implemented using a REST\n  style architecture these days rather than a SOAP one. Lets step back a\n  second and explain what REST is.What is a REST Web ServiceThe acronym REST stands for Representational State Transfer, this\n  basically means that each unique URL is a representation of some\n  object. You can get the contents of that object using an HTTP GET, to\n  delete it, you then might use a POST, PUT, or DELETE to modify the\n  object (in practice most of the services use a POST for this).Who\'s using REST?All of Yahoo\'s web services use REST, including Flickr, del.icio.us\n  API uses it, pubsub, bloglines, technorati, and both eBay, and Amazon\n  have web services for both REST and SOAP.Who\'s using SOAP?Google seams to be consistent in implementing their web services to\n  use SOAP, with the exception of Blogger, which uses XML-RPC. You will\n  find SOAP web services in lots of enterprise software as well.REST vs SOAPAs you may have noticed the companies I mentioned that are using REST\n  api\'s haven\'t been around for very long, and their apis came out this\n  year mostly. So REST is definitely the trendy way to create a web\n  service, if creating web services could ever be trendy (lets face it\n  you use soap to wash, and you rest when your tired). The main\n  advantages of REST web services are:Lightweight - not a lot of extra xml markup Human Readable Results\n  Easy to build - no toolkits required SOAP also has some advantages:Easy to consume - sometimes Rigid - type checking, adheres to a\n  contract Development tools For consuming web services, its sometimes a\n  toss up between which is easier. For instance Google\'s AdWords web\n  service is really hard to consume (in CF anyways), it uses SOAP\n  headers, and a number of other things that make it kind of difficult.\n  On the converse, Amazon\'s REST web service can sometimes be tricky to\n  parse because it can be highly nested, and the result schema can vary\n  quite a bit based on what you search for.Which ever architecture you choose make sure its easy for developers\n  to access it, and well documented.Freitag, P.

REST is over HTTP, but SOAP can be over any transport protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, JMS etc. Rest VS SOAPSOAP:\xe2\x96\xba SOAP is simple object access protocol that run on TCP/UDP/SMTP.\n\xe2\x96\xba SOAP read and write request response messages in XML format.\n\xe2\x96\xba SOAP uses interface in order to define the services.\n\xe2\x96\xba SOAP is more secure as it has its own security and well defined standards.\n\xe2\x96\xba SOAP follows RPC and Document style to define web services.\n\xe2\x96\xba SOAP uses SOAP-UI as client tools for testing.REST\xe2\x96\xba REST is representational state transfer that uses underlying HTTP protocols.\n\xe2\x96\xba REST is stateless.\n\xe2\x96\xba REST is an architectural style that is used to describe and define web services.\n\xe2\x96\xba REST can read and write request response messages in JSON/XML/Plain HTML.\n\xe2\x96\xba REST uses URI for each resource that is used in web service.A resource can be image text method etc.\n\xe2\x96\xba REST uses set of VERBs like HTTP\'s GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\n\xe2\x96\xba REST is easy to develop and easy to manage as compared to SOAP UI.\n\xe2\x96\xba REST has light weight client tools or plugins that can easily be integrated inside browser.\n\xe2\x96\xba REST services are cache able. REST stands for Representational State Transfer where as SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.SOAP defines its own security where as REST inherits security from\nunderlying transport.SOAP doesnot support error handling but REST has built-in error\nhandling.REST is lightweight and does not require XML parsing. REST can be consumed by any client, even a web browser with Ajax and Javascript. REST consumes less bandwidth, it does not require a SOAP header for every message.Soap Web-services :RestWeb-Services :SOAP web service always make a POST operation whereas using REST you can choose specific http methods like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE.\nExample: to get an item using SOAP you should create a request xml but in the case of REST you can just specify the item id in the url itself.REST is easier to use for the most part and is more flexible.Unlike SOAP, REST doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to use XML to provide the response. We can find REST-based Web services that output the data in Command Separated Value (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Really Simple Syndication (RSS). We can obtain the output we need in a form that\xe2\x80\x99s easy to parse within the language we need for our application.REST is more efficient(use smaller message formats),fast and closer to other Web technologies in design philosophyDifference between Rest and Soap
