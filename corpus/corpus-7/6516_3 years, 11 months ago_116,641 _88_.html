I am trying to do the Michael Hartl tutorial.  When I attempt to install rails 3.2.14 in my gemset, I get the following issue:$ gem install rails -v 3.2.14ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem \'rails\' (= 3.2.14), here is why:Unable to download data from https://rubygems.org/ - SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://s3.amazonaws.com/production.s3.rubygems.org/specs.4.8.gz)After Googling around, I found that I could use a non-SSL source for rubygems so I ran:Then, when I tried to install rails again, it was successful.  However, I still got the issue above but as a warning:WARNING:  Unable to pull data from \'https://rubygems.org/\': SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://s3.amazonaws.com/production.s3.rubygems.org/specs.4.8.gz)How can I remove this warning/error entirely?I am using the following:Make sure you use latest rvm:Then you can do two things:Update certificates:Update rubygems:Find path for certificate:Generate certificate:The whole code: https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/blob/master/scripts/functions/osx-ssl-certsMake sure to update package ca-certificates. (on old systems it might not be available - do not use that old system that does not receive security updates any more)The Ruby Installer builds for windows are prepared by Luis Lavena and the path to certificates will be showing something like C:/Users/Luis/... check https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/issues/249 for more details and this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/27298259/497756 for fix.Latest findings...https://gist.github.com/luislavena/f064211759ee0f806c88Most importantly...download \nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubygems/rubygems/master/lib/rubygems/ssl_certs/rubygems.org/AddTrustExternalCARoot-2048.pemFigure out where to stick itThen just copy the .pem file in ../2.1.0/rubygems/ssl_certs/ and go on about your business.Goto link http://rubygems.org/pages/downloadIf you want to use the non-SSL source, try removing the HTTPS source first, and then adding the HTTP one:UPDATE:As mpapis states, this should be used only as a temporary workaround. There could be some security concerns if you\'re accessing RubyGems through the non-SSL source.Once the workaround is not needed anymore, you should restore the SSL-source:On Windows you\'ll have to use HTTP source to update gem then change back to using HTTPS. Edit: Warning I\'m not sure if this is safe. Does anyone know if ruby packages are signed? The accepted answer looks like a better solution.Rubygems.org has a guide that not only explains how to fix this problem, but also why so many people are having it: SSL Certificate Update\nThe reason for the problem is rubygems.org switched to a more secure SSL certificate (SHA-2 which use 256bit encryption). The rubygems command line tool bundles the reference to the correct certificate. Therefore rubygems itself can\xe2\x80\x99t be updated using an older version of rubygems. Rubygems must first be updated manually.First find out what rubygems you have:Depending on whether you have a 1.8.x, 2.0.x or 2.2.x, you will need to download an update gem, named \xe2\x80\x9crubygems-update-X.Y.Z.gem\xe2\x80\x9d, where X.Y.Z is the version you need.\nRunning 1.8.x: download: https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/releases/tag/v1.8.30\nRunning 2.0.x: download: https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/releases/tag/v2.0.15\nRunning 2.2.x: download: https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/releases/tag/v2.2.3Install update gem: Run update gem:Check that rubygems was updated:Uninstall update gem:At this point, you may be OK. But it is possible that you do not have the latest public key file for the new certificate. To do this:Download the latest certificate, (currently AddTrustExternalCARoot-2048.pem)\nfrom https://rubygems.org/pages/download.\nAll of the certs are also located at:  https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/tree/master/lib/rubygems/ssl_certsFind out where to put it:Put this file in the \xe2\x80\x9crubygems\\ssl_certs\xe2\x80\x9d directory at this location.As per rubygems commit, the certificates are moved to more specific directories. Thus, currently the certificate(AddTrustExternalCARoot-2048.pem) is expected to be on the following path lib/rubygems/ssl_certs/rubygems.org/AddTrustExternalCARoot-2048.pemTry to use the source website for the gems, i.e rubygems.org. Use http instead of https. This method does not involve any work such as installing certs and all that.Example - This works, but there is one caveat though. The gem is installed, but the documentation is not because of cert errors. Here is the error I get Running gem update --system worked for meSimply uninstalling and reinstalling openssl with homebrew solved this issue for me.brew uninstall --force opensslbrew install opensslUpdate the cert.pem to newest file that provide by cURL: http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pemIf you are using windows, open https://rubygems.org/ with internet explorer.Click on security information and import the certificate. The bottom line is your certification chain is outdated and you need to add this new certificate. Remember that this is not a security violation as long as you can validate the certificate as trusted.This exact error happened to me today on an Ubuntu virtual machine running on VirtualBox. I tried most of the solutions shown above before I noticed that I had resumed from a very old suspended state, and my clock was off by many days.Updating the clock immediately fixed my issue. Here\'s the command I used in my case:sudo service ntp stop && sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org && sudo service ntp startIn my case, the Ubuntu CA certificates were out of date. I fixed it by running:The particular case of RubyGems (the command line tool) is that it requires to bundle inside of its code the trust certificates, which allow RubyGems to establish a connection with the servers even when base operating system is unable to verify the identity of them.Up until a few months ago, this certificate was provided by one CA, but newer certificate is provided by a different one.Because of this, existing installations of RubyGems would have to been updated before the switch of the certificate and give enough time for the change to spread (and people to update)Anyone can find his solution by following the simple steps given in the link belowhttps://gist.github.com/luislavena/f064211759ee0f806c88Try Hope it solves the problem.I had same problem while trying to install cucumber gem. However I noticed that bundler gem already installed with ruby 2.0.\nI created a Gemfile.rb in the project folder with required gems and followed this stepsAll the required gems installed.Install CSWcacertificates prior to \'gem install\'If you\'re using a ruby kit that\'s not from OpenCSW, your ruby version may expect to find the certificate file in another place.  In this case, I simply symlinked OpenCSW\'s /etc/opt/csw/ssl/cert.pem to the expected place.Check where ruby expects to find it :Then, if there\'s a discrepancy, link it: Or may be prevented by firewall like me. Try this:sudo gem install --http-proxy http://localhost:port cocoapods -VFor Windows user:After installing Ruby 2.2.3 (+ rubygems 2.5.1) successfully on a test machine with access to the internet, I had this SSL error when I installed bundler on a production machine, within the network.As I had network access limitations, and there was no way to change the settings for SSL access, and based on the error messages, I performed the steps below to be able to finish the installation of the bundler\n(this may sound crazy, but it worked...).Through a machine with unrestricted access to the internet, downloaded the following files:I added these files on an intranet server, keeping the folder structure of the links above:spec.4.8.gz e latest_specs.4.8.gzbundler-1.11.2.gemspec.rzbundler-1.11.2.gemThen I added my intranet to access gem source:I have run with the success the "gem install bundler" after installation, all it took was remove my intranet of the gem:I hope that is useful in any similar situation....As a Windows 10 user, I followed Dheerendra\'s answer, and it worked for me one day. The next day, I experienced the issue again, and his fix didn\'t work. For me, the fix was to update bundler with:gem update bundlerI believe my version of bundler was more than a few months old.Make sure of that you have installed ruby with --disable-binary option,\nif not, uninstall it and reinstall it with the option.more info here
