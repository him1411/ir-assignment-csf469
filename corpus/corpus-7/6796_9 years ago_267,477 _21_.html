I need to join two binary files with a *.bat script on Windows.How can I achieve that?Windows type command works similarly to UNIX cat.Example 1:is equivalent of:Example 2:This command will merge all the vcards into one.You can use copy /b like this:If you have control over the machine where you\'re doing your work, I highly recommend installing GnuWin32. Just "Download All" and let the wget program retrieve all the packages. You will then have access to cat, grep, find, gzip, tar, less, and hundreds of others.GnuWin32 is one of the first things I install on a new Windows box.Shameless PowerShell plug (because I think the learning curve is a pain, so teaching something at any opportunity can help)Note that type is an alias for Get-Content, so if you like it better, you can write:Just use the dos copy command with multiple source files and one destination file.copy file1+file2 appendedfileYou might need the /B option for binary filesIf you simply want to append text to the end of existing file, you can use the >> pipe. ex:In Windows 10\'s Redstone 1 release, the Windows added a real Linux subsystem for the NTOS kernel.  I think originally it was intended to support Android apps, and maybe docker type scenarios.  Microsoft partnered with Canonical and added an actual native bash shell.  Also, you can use the apt package manager to get many Ubuntu packages.  For example, you can do apt-get gcc to install the GCC tool chain as you would on a Linux box.If such a thing existed while I was in university, I think I could have done most of my Unix programming assignments in the native Windows bash shell.If you have to use a batch script and have python installed here is a polygot answer in batch and python:If saved as join.bat usage would be:Thanks too this answer for the inspiration.
