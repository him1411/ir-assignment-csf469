By default, the Requests library writes log messages to the console, along the lines of Starting new HTTP connection (1): example.com etc. I\'m usually not interested in these messages, how do I disable them?I found out how to configure requests\'s logging level, it\'s done via the standard logging module. I decided to configure it to not log messages unless they are at least warnings:If you wish to apply this setting for the urllib3 library (typically used by requests) too, add the following:In case you came here looking for a way to modify logging of any (possibly deeply nested) module, use logging.Logger.manager.loggerDict to get a dictionary of all of the logger objects, which you can then use as the argument to logging.getLogger:In this way all the messages of level=INFO from urllib3 won\'t be present in the logfile.So you can continue to use the level=INFO for your log messages...just modify this for the library you are using.Let me copy/paste the documentation section which it I wrote about week or two ago, after having a problem similar to yours:For anybody using logging.config.dictConfig you can alter the requests library log level in the dictionary like this:simple: just add requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings() after import requestsI\'m not sure if the previous approaches have stopped working, but in any case, here\'s another way of removing the warnings:PYTHONWARNINGS="ignore:Unverified HTTPS request" ./do-insecure-request.pyBasically, adding an environment variable in the context of the script execution.From the documentation: https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#disabling-warningsIf You have configuration file, You can configure it.Add urllib3 in loggers section:Add logger_urllib3 section:I was having the same issue using the requests library for an HTTPS request. None of the answers above worked. This one did:import urllib3\nurllib3.disable_warnings()https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-usage.html#ssl-warnings
