I need to know when the finalize() method is called in the JVM. I created a test class which writes into a file when the finalize() method is called by overriding it. It is not executed. Can anybody tell me the reason why it is not executing?In general it\'s best not to rely on finalize() to do any cleaning up etc.According to the Javadoc (which it would be worth reading), it is:Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object.As Joachim pointed out, this may never happen in the life of a program if the object is always accessible.Also, the garbage collector is not guaranteed to run at any specific time. In general, what I\'m trying to say is finalize() is probably not the best method to use in general unless there\'s something specific you need it for.The finalize method is called when an object is about to get garbage collected. That can be at any time after it has become eligible for garbage collection.Note that it\'s entirely possible that an object never gets garbage collected (and thus finalize is never called). This can happen when the object never becomes eligible for gc (because it\'s reachable through the entire lifetime of the JVM) or when no garbage collection actually runs between the time the object become eligible and the time the JVM stops running (this often occurs with simple test programs).There are ways to tell the JVM to run finalize on objects that it wasn\'t called on yet, but using them isn\'t a good idea either (the guarantees of that method aren\'t very strong either).If you rely on finalize for the correct operation of your application, then you\'re doing something wrong. finalize should only be used for cleanup of (usually non-Java) resources. And that\'s exactly because the JVM doesn\'t guarantee that finalize is ever called on any object.if overridding finalize() it is good programming practice to use a\n  try-catch-finally statement and to\n  always call super.finalize(). This\n  is a safety measure to ensure you do\n  not inadvertently miss closing a\n  resource used by the objects calling\n  class any exception thrown by finalize() during garbage collection halts the\n  finalization but is otherwise ignoredquoted from: http://www.janeg.ca/scjp/gc/finalize.htmlYou could also check this article:The Java finalize() method is not a destructor and should not be used to handle logic that your application depends on. The Java spec states there is no guarantee that the finalize method is called at all during the livetime of the application.What you problably want is a combination of finally and a cleanup method, as in:Check out Effective Java, 2nd edition page 27.\nItem 7: Avoid finalizersFinalizers are unpredictable, often dangerous, and generally unnecessary. never do anything time-critical in a finalizer. never\n  depend on a finalizer to update critical persistent state.To terminate a resource, use try-finally instead:When is the finalize() method called in Java?The finalize method will be called after the GC detects that the object is no longer reachable, and before it actually reclaims the memory used by the object.If an object never becomes unreachable, finalize() will never be called on it.If the GC doesn\'t run then finalize() may never be called.  (Normally, the GC only runs when the JVM decides that there is likely to enough garbage to make it worthwhile.)It may take more than one GC cycle before the GC determines that a specific object is unreachable.  (Java GCs are typically "generational" collectors ...)Once the GC detects an object is unreachable and finalizable, it is places on a finalization queue.  Finalization typically occurs asynchronously with the normal GC.(The JVM spec actually allows a JVM to never run finalizers ... provided that it doesn\'t reclaim the space used by the objects.  A JVM that was implemented this way would be crippled / useless, but it this behavior is "allowed".)The upshot is that it is unwise to rely on finalization to do things that have to be done in a definite time-frame.  It is "best practice" not to use them at all.  There should be a better (i.e. more reliable) way to do whatever it is you are trying to do in the finalize() method.  The only legitimate use for finalization is to clean up resources associated with objects that have been lost by application code.  Even then, you should try to write the application code so that it doesn\'t lose the objects in the first place.  (For example, use Java 7+ try-with-resources to ensure that close() is always called ...)I created a test class which writes into a file when the finalize() method is called by overriding it.  It is not executed. Can anybody tell me the reason why it is not executing?It is hard to say, but there are a few possibilities:Since there is an uncertainity in calling of finalize() method by JVM (not sure whether finalize() which is overridden would be executed or not), for study purposes the better way to observe what happens when finalize() is called, is to force the JVM to call garbage collection by command System.gc().Specifically, finalize() is called when an object is no longer in use. But when we try to call it by creating new objects there is no certainty of its call. So for certainty we create a null object c which obviously  has no future use, hence we see the object c\'s finalize call.ExampleOutputNote - Even after printing upto 70 and after which object b is not being used in the program, there is  uncertainty that b is cleared or not by JVM since "Called finalize method in class Bike..." is not printed.finalize will print out the count for class creation. mainAs you can see. The following out put show the gc got executed first time when the class count is 36.Having wrestled with finalizer methods lately (in order to dispose connection pools during testing), I have to say that finalizer lacks many things. Using VisualVM to observe as well as using weak references to track the actual interaction I found that following things are true in a Java 8 environment (Oracle JDK, Ubuntu 15):Final ThoughtFinalize method is unreliable but can be used for one thing only. You can ensure that an object was closed or disposed before it was garbage collected making it possible to implement a fail safe if objects with a more complex life-cylce involving a end-of-life action are handled correctly. That is the one reason I can think of that makes it worth in order to override it.finalize method is not guaranteed.This method is called when the object becomes eligible for GC. There are many situations where the objects may not be garbage collected.An Object becomes eligible for Garbage collection or GC if its not reachable from any live threads or any static refrences in other words you can say that an object becomes eligible for garbage collection if its all references are null. Cyclic dependencies are not counted as reference so if Object A has reference of object B and object B has reference of Object A and they don\'t have any other live reference then both Objects A and B will be eligible for Garbage collection. \nGenerally an object becomes eligible for garbage collection in Java on following cases:Class where we override finalize methodThe chances of finalize method being calledwhen the memory is overloaded with dump objects the gc will call finalize methodrun and see the console, where you dont find the finalize method being called frequently, when the memory is getting overloaded then the finalize method will be called. Sometimes when it is destroyed, an object must make an action. For example, if an object has a non-java resource such as a file handle or a font, you can verify that these resources are released before destroying an object. To manage such situations, java offers a mechanism called "finalizing". By finalizing it, you can define specific actions that occur when an object is about to be removed from the garbage collector.\nTo add a finalizer to a class simply define the finalize() method. Java execution time calls this method whenever it is about to delete an object of that class. Within the finalize method() you specify actions to be performed before destroying an object.\nThe garbage collector is periodically searched for objects that no longer refer to any running state or indirectly any other object with reference. Before an asset is released, the Java runtime calls the finalize() method on the object. The finalize() method has the following general form:With the protected keyword, access to finalize() by code outside its class is prevented.\nIt is important to understand that finalize() is called just just before the garbage collection. It is not called when an object leaves the scope, for example. It means you can not know when, or if, finalize() will be executed. As a result, the program must provide other means to free system resources or other resources used by the object. You should not rely on finalize() for normal running of the program.Java allows objects to implement a method called finalize()\n  that might get called.finalize() method gets called if the garbage collector tries to\n  collect the object.If the garbage collector doesn\'t run, the method doesn\'t get called.If the garbage collector fails to collect the object and tries to run\n  it again, the method doesn\'t get called in the second time.In practice, you are highly unlikely to use it in real projects.Just keep in mind that it might not get called and that it definitely\n  won\'t be called twice. The finalize() method could run zero or one\n  time.In the following code, finalize() method produces no output when we\n  run it since the program exits before there is any need to run the\n  garbage collector.SourceTry runiing this Program for better understanding
