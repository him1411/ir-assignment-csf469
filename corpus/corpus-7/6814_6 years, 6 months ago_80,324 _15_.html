I want git to list all tags along with the full annotation or commit message. Something like this is close:This does exactly what I want except that it will only show up to the first 5 lines of the tag message.I guess I can just use a very large number. What is the highest number I can use here? Is it the same on every computer?UPDATE: I have had much time to think about this, and now I think I don\'t necessarily want to show the entire message if it is extraordinarily long. Something like this seems to work fine for me:If the tag message is really longer than 99 lines, I don\'t want to see all of it. But Git is extremely complex and flexible. In what cases would this not be the best solution? I noticed many of the posted solutions used the -l otion, but isn\'t that just for specifying a pattern to search for?Try this it will list all the tags along with annotations & 9 lines of message for every tag:can also useif specific tags are to list: (e.g, above command will only display tags starting with "v3.")-l , --list \n           List tags with names that match the given pattern (or all if no pattern is given).\n           Running "git tag" without arguments also lists all tags. The pattern is a shell wildcard\n           (i.e., matched using fnmatch(3)). Multiple patterns may be given; if any of them\n           matches, the tag is shown.Short and sweet. This will list up to 99 lines from the annotation/commit message. Here is a link to the official documentation for git tag: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-tagMark Longair\'s answer (using git show) is close to what is desired in the question.  However, it also includes the commit pointed at by the tag, along with the full patch for that commit.  Since the commit can be somewhat unrelated to the tag (it\'s only one commit that the tag is attempting to capture), this may be undesirable.  I believe the following is a bit nicer:It\'s far from pretty, but you could create a script or an alias that does something like this:Last tag message only:I prefer doing this on the command line, but if you don\'t mind a web interface and you use GitHub, you can visit https://github.com/user/repo/tags and click on the "..." next to each tag to display its annotation.
