I need to be able to add for example "contenteditable" to elements, based on a boolean variable on scope.Example use:Would result in contenteditable=true being added to the element if $scope.editMode was set to true.\nIs there some easy way to implement this ng-class like attribute behavior? I\'m considering writing a directive and sharing if not.Edit: \nI can see that there seems to be some similarities between my proposed attrs directive and ng-bind-attrs, but it was removed in 1.0.0.rc3, why so?I am using the following to conditionally set the class attr when ng-class can\'t be used (for example when styling SVG):The same approach should work for other attribute types.(I think you need to be on latest unstable Angular to use ng-attr-, I\'m currently on 1.1.4)You can prefix attributes with ng-attr to eval an Angular expression. When the result of the expressions undefined this removes the value from the attribute.Will produce (when value is false)So don\'t use false because that will produce the word "false" as the value.When using this trick in a directive. The attributes for the directive will be false if they are missing a value.For example, the above would be false.I got this working by hard setting the attribute. And controlling the attribute applicability using the boolean value for the attribute.Here is the code snippet:I hope this helps.In the latest version of Angular (1.1.5), they have included a conditional directive called ngIf.  It is different from ngShow and ngHide in that the elements aren\'t hidden, but not included in the DOM at all.  They are very useful for components which are costly to create but aren\'t used:To get an attribute to show a specific value based on a boolean check, or be omitted entirely if the boolean check failed, I used the following:ng-attr-example="{{params.type == \'test\' ? \'itWasTest\' : undefined }}"Example usage:<div ng-attr-class="{{params.type == \'test\' ? \'itWasTest\' : undefined }}">Would output <div class="itWasTest"> or <div> based on the value of params.type<h1 ng-attr-contenteditable="{{isTrue || undefined }}">{{content.title}}</h1>will produce when isTrue=true :\n<h1 contenteditable="true">{{content.title}}</h1>and when isTrue=false :\n<h1>{{content.title}}</h1>I actually wrote a patch to do this a few months ago (after someone asked about it in #angularjs on freenode).It probably won\'t be merged, but it\'s very similar to ngClass: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/4269Whether it gets merged or not, the existing ng-attr-* stuff is probably suitable for your needs (as others have mentioned), although it might be a bit clunkier than the more ngClass-style functionality that you\'re suggesting.Regarding the accepted solution, the one posted by Ashley Davis, the method described still prints the attribute in the DOM, regardless of the fact that the value it has been assigned is undefined.For example, on an input field setup with both an ng-model and a value attribute:Regardless of what\'s behind myValue, the value attribute still gets printed in the DOM, thus, interpreted. Ng-model then, becomes overridden.A bit unpleasant, but using ng-if does the trick:I would recommend using a more detailed check inside the ng-if directives :)Also you can use an expression like this:For input field validation you can do:This will apply the attribute max to 100 only if discountType is defined as %
