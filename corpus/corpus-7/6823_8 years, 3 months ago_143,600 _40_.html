How can I make a UIScrollView scroll to the bottom within my code? Or in a more generic way, to any point of a subview?You can use the UIScrollView\'s setContentOffset:animated: function to scroll to any part of the content view. Here\'s some code that would scroll to the bottom, assuming your scrollView is self.scrollView:Hope that helps!Simplest Solution:Swift version of the accepted answer for easy copy pasting: Setting the content offset to the height of the content size is wrong: it scrolls the bottom of the content to the top of the scroll view, and thus out of sight.The correct solution is to scroll the bottom of the content to the bottom of the scroll view, like this (sv is the UIScrollView):Just an enhancement to the existing answer.It takes care of the bottom inset as well (in case you\'re using that to adjust your scroll view when the keyboard is visible)Scroll To TopScroll To BottomA Swift 2.2 solution, taking contentInset into accountThis should be in an extensionNote that you may want to check if bottomOffset.y > 0 before scrollI also found another useful way of doing this in the case you are using a UITableview (which is a subclass of UIScrollView):What if contentSize is lower than bounds? For Swift it is:  With an (optional) footerView and contentInset, the solution is:Using UIScrollView\'s setContentOffset:animated: function to scroll to the bottom in Swift.A swifty implementation: valdyr, hope this will help you:Category to the rescue!Add this to a shared utility header somewhere:And then to that utility implementation:Then Implement it wherever you like, for instance:A good way to ensure the bottom of your content is visible is to use the formula:This ensures the bottom edge of your content is always at or above the bottom edge of the view. The MIN(0, ...) is required because UITableView (and probably UIScrollView) ensures contentOffsetY >= 0 when the user tries to scroll by visibly snapping contentOffsetY = 0. This looks pretty weird to the user.The code to implement this is:If you don\'t need animation, this works:While Matt solution seems correct to me you need to take in account also the collection view inset if there is one that has been set-up.The adapted code will be:Solution to scroll to last item of a table View : Swift 3 :Didn\'t work for me, when I tried to use it in UITableViewController on self.tableView (iOS 4.1), after adding footerView. It scrolls out of the borders, showing black screen.Alternative solution:I found that contentSize doesn\'t really reflect the actual size of the text, so when trying to scroll to the bottom, it will be a little bit off. The best way to determine the actual content size is actually to use the NSLayoutManager\'s usedRectForTextContainer: method:To determine how much text actually is shown in the UITextView, you can calculate it by subtracting the text container insets from the frame height.Then it becomes easy to scroll:Some numbers for reference on what the different sizes represent for an empty UITextView.In swift:
