I have a string that has two single quotes in it, the \' character. In between the single quotes is the data I want.How can I write a regex to extract "the data i want" from the following text?Assuming you want the part between single quotes, use this regular expression with a Matcher:Example:Result:You don\'t need regex for this.Add apache commons lang to your project (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/), then use:Because you also ticked Scala, a solution without regex which easily deals with multiple quoted strings:as in javascript:the actual regexp is: /\'([^\']+)\'/if you use the non greedy modifier (as per another post) it\'s like this:it is cleaner.In Scala,There\'s a simple one-liner for this:By making the matching group optional, this also caters for quotes not being found by returning a blank in that case.See live demo.String dataIWant = mydata.split("\'")[1];See Live Demo
