I need to remove all characters from a string which aren\'t in a-z A-Z 0-9 set or are not spaces.Does anyone have a function to do this?Sounds like you almost knew what you wanted to do already, you basically defined it as a regex.For unicode characters, it is :Regular expression is your answer. here\'s a really simple regex for that:and used as you need it (with a forward / slash delimiter).Test it here with this great tool that explains what the regex is doing:http://www.regexr.com/ I was looking for the answer too and my intention was to clean every non-alpha and there shouldn\'t have more than one space.\n\nSo, I modified Alex\'s answer to this, and this is working for me\npreg_replace(\'/[^a-z|\\s+]+/i\', \' \', $name)\n\nThe regex above turned sy8ed sirajul7_islam to sy ed sirajul islam\n\nExplanation: regex will check NOT ANY from a to z in case insensitive way or more than one white spaces, and it will be converted to a single space.You can test it here : http://regexr.com/i use this:
