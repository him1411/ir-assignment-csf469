I\'m new to Docker, and it\'s unclear how to access an external database from a container. Is the best way to hard-code in the connection string?You can pass environment variables to your containers with the -e flag.An example from a startup script:Or, if you don\'t want to have the value on the command-line where it will be displayed by ps, etc., -e can pull in the value from the current environment if you just give it without the =:If you have many environment variables and especially if they\'re meant to be secret, you can use an env-file:The --env-file flag takes a filename as an argument and expects each line to be in the VAR=VAL format, mimicking the argument passed to --env. Comment lines need only be prefixed with #You can pass using -e parameters with docker run .. command as mentioned here and as mentioned by @errata. \nHowever, the possible downside of this approach is that your credentials will be displayed in the process listing, where you run it.\nTo make it more secure, you may write your credentials in a configuration file and do docker run with --env-file as mentioned here. Then you can control the access of that config file, so that others having access to that machine wouldn\'t see your credentials.If you are using \'docker-compose\' as the method to spin up your container(s), there is actually a useful way to pass an environment variable defined on your server to the Docker container.In your docker-compose.yml file, let\'s say you are spinning up a basic hapi-js container and the code looks like:Let\'s say that the local server that your docker project is on has an environment variable named \'NODE_DB_CONNECT\' that you want to pass to your hapi-js container, and you want its new name to be \'HAPI_DB_CONNECT\'. Then in the docker-compose.yml file, you would pass the local environment variable to the container and rename it like so:I hope this helps you to avoid hard-coding a database connect string in any file in your container!Use -e or --env value to set environment variables (default []).An example from a startup script:If you want to use multiple environments from the command line then before every environment variable use the -e flag.Example:Note: Make sure put the container name after the environment variable, not before that.If you need to set up many variables, use the --env-file flagFor example,For any other help, look into the Docker help:Official documentation:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/For Amazon AWS ECS/ECR, you should manage your environment variables (especially secrets) via a private S3 bucket.
