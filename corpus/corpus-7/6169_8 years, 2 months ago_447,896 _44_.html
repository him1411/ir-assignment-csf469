How can I select data in the same query from two different databases that are on two different servers in SQL Server?Yes you can.I think you\'re asking how, so I\'ll answer that.What you are looking for are Linked Servers. You can get to them in SSMS from the following location in the tree of the Object Explorer:Server Objects-->Linked Serversor you can use sp_addlinkedserver.You only have to set up one. Once you have that, you can call a table on the other server like so:Note that the owner isn\'t always dbo, so make sure to replace it with whatever schema you use.You can do it using Linked Server.Typically linked servers are configured to enable the Database Engine to execute a Transact-SQL statement that includes tables in another instance of SQL Server, or another database product such as Oracle. Many types OLE DB data sources can be configured as linked servers, including Microsoft Access and Excel. Linked servers offer the following advantages:Read more about Linked Servers.Server Objects -> Linked Servers -> New Linked ServerProvide Remote Server Name.Select Remote Server Type (SQL Server or Other).Select Security -> Be made using this security context and provide login and password of remote server.Click OK and you are done !!Here is a simple tutorial for creating a linked server.OR You can add linked server using query.Syntax:Read more about sp_addlinkedserver.You have to create linked server only once. After creating linked server, we can query it as follows:You can also look at using Linked Servers.  Linked servers can be other types of data sources too such as DB2 platforms.  This is one method for trying to access DB2 from a SQL Server TSQL or Sproc call...Querying across 2 different databases is a distributed query. Here is a list of some techniques plus the pros and cons:try this:These are all fine answers, but this one is missing and it has it\'s own powerful uses. Possibly it doesn\'t fit what the OP wanted, but the question was vague and I feel others may find their way here. Basically you can use 1 window to run a query against multiple servers, here\'s how:In SSMS open Registered Servers and create a New Server Group under Local Server Groups. Under this group create New Server Registration for each server you wish to query. If the DB names are different ensure to set a default for each in the properties.Now go back to the Group you created in the first step, right click and select New Query. A new query window will open and any query you run will be executed on each server in the group. The results are presented in a single data set with an extra column name indicating which server the record came from. If you use the status bar you will note the server name is replaced with multiple.Created a Linked Server definition in one server to the other (you need SA to do this), then just reference them with 4-part naming (see BOL).Server 2008:When in SSMS connected to server1.DB1 and try:SELECT  * FROM\n[server2].[DB2].[dbo].[table1]as others noted, if it doesn\'t work it\'s because the server isn\'t linked...I get the Error: \nCould not find server DB2 in sys.servers. Verify that the correct server name was specified. If necessary, execute stored procedure sp_addlinkedserver to add the server to sys.servers.To add the server:\nreference: To add server using sp_addlinkedserver\nLink: [1]: To add server using sp_addlinkedserverTo see what is in your sys.servers just query it:Server Objects-----> linked server---> new linked server \nIn linked server write server name or IP address for other server and choose SQL Server \nIn Security select (be made using this security context )\nWrite login and password for other server Now connected thenSelect * from [server name or ip addresses ].databasename.dbo.tblnameso its should go like this -I know this is an old question but I use synonyms. Supposedly the query is executed within database server A, and looks for a table in a database server B that does not exist on server A. Add then a synonym on A database that calls your table from server B. Your query doesn\'t have to include any schemas, or different database names, just call the table name per usual and it will work.There\'s no need to link servers as synonyms per say are sort of linking.
