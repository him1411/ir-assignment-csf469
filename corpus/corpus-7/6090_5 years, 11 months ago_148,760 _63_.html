I have this section defined in my _Layout.cshtmlI can easily use it from a view: What I\'m struggling with is how to get some content injected inside this section from a partial view.Let\'s assume this is my view page: I need to inject some content inside the Scripts section from _myPartial partial view.How can I do this?Sections don\'t work in partial views and that\'s by design. You may use some custom helpers to achieve similar behavior, but honestly it\'s the view\'s responsibility to include the necessary scripts, not the partial\'s responsibility. I would recommend using the @scripts section of the main view to do that and not have the partials worry about scripts.This is quite a popular question, so I\'ll post my solution up.\nI had the same problem and although it isn\'t ideal, I think it actually works quite well and doesn\'t make the partial dependant on the view.\nMy scenario was that an action was accessible by itself but also could be embedded into a a view - a google map.In my _layout I have:  In my index view I have:In my clients view I have (all the map and assoc. html):My Clients_Scripts view contains the javascript to be rendered onto the pageThis way my script is isolated and can be rendered into the page where required, with the body_scripts tag only being rendered on the first occurrence that the razor view engine finds it.That lets me have everything separated - it\'s a solution that works quite well for me, others may have issues with it, but it does patch the "by design" hole.From the solutions in this thread, I came up with the following probably overcomplicated solution that lets you delay rendering any html (scripts too) within a using block.Typical scenario: In a partial view, only include the block one time no matter how many times the partial view is repeated in the page:In a partial view, include the block for every time the partial is used:In a partial view, only include the block once no matter how many times the partial is repeated, but later render it specifically by name when-i-call-you:(i.e. display the delayed section in a parent view)I had this problem and used this technique.Its the best solution i found which is very flexible. Also please vote here to add support for cumulative section declarationFollowing the unobtrusive principle, it\'s not quite required for "_myPartial" to inject content directly into scripts section. You could add those partial view scripts into separate .js file and reference them into @scripts section from parent view.If you do have a legitimate need to run some js from a partial, here\'s how you could do it, jQuery is required:There is a fundamental flaw in the way we think about web, especially when using MVC. The flaw is that JavaScript is somehow the view\'s responsibility. A view is a view, JavaScript (behavioral or otherwise) is JavaScript. In Silverlight and WPF\'s MVVM pattern we we\'re faced with "view first" or "model first". In MVC we should always try to reason from the model\'s standpoint and JavaScript is a part of this model in many ways. I would suggest using the AMD pattern (I myself like RequireJS). Seperate your JavaScript in modules, define your functionality and hook into your html from JavaScript instead of relying on a view to load the JavaScript. This will clean up your code, seperate your concerns and make life easier all in one fell swoop.The first solution I can think of, is to use ViewBag to store the values that must be rendered. Onestly I never tried if this work from a partial view, but it should imo.You can\'t need using sections in partial view.Include in your Partial View.\nIt execute the function after jQuery loaded.\nYou can alter de condition clause for your code.Julio SpaderThere is a way to insert sections in partial views, though it\'s not pretty. You need to have access to two variables from the parent View. Since part of your partial view\'s very purpose is to create that section, it makes sense to require these variables.Here\'s what it looks like to insert a section in the partial view:And in the page inserting the partial view...You can also use this technique to define the contents of a section programmatically in any class.Enjoy!You can use these Extension Methods: (Save as PartialWithScript.cs)Use like this:Example partial: (_MyPartial.cshtml)\nPut the html in the if, and the js in the else.In your _Layout.cshtml, or wherever you want the scripts from the partials on to be rendered, put the following (once): It will render only the javascript of all partials on the current page at this location.Then to use your partial, simply do this: It will render only the html at this location.This worked for me allowing me to co-locate javascript and html for partial view in same file. Helps with thought process to see html and related part in same partial view file.I solved this a completely different route (because I was in a hurry and didn\'t want to implement a new HtmlHelper):I wrapped my Partial View in a big if-else statement:Then, I called the Partial twice with a custom ViewData:I had a similar problem, where I had a master page as follows:but the partial view depended on some JavaScript in the Scripts section. I solved it by encoding the partial view as JSON, loading it into a JavaScript variable and then using this to populate a div, so:Well, I guess the other posters have provided you with a means to directly include an @section within your partial (by using 3rd party html helpers).But, I reckon that, if your script is tightly coupled to your partial, just put your javascript directly inside an inline <script> tag within your partial and be done with it (just be careful of script duplication if you intend on using the partial more than once in a single view);choicely, you could use a your Folder/index.cshtml as a masterpage then add section scripts. Then, in your layout you have:and your index.cshtml:and it will working over all your partialviews. It work for mePluto\'s idea in a nicer way:CustomWebViewPage.cs:Views\\web.config:View:Partial (_BackendSearchForm.cshtml):Layout page:assume you have a partial view called _contact.cshtml, your contact can be a legal (name) or a physical subject (first name, lastname). your view should take care about what\'s rendered and that can be achived with javascript. so delayed rendering and JS inside view may be needed.the only way i think, how it can be ommitted, is when we create an unobtrusive way of handling such UI concerns.also note that MVC 6 will have a so called View Component, even MVC futures had some similar stuff and Telerik also supports such a thing...I had the similar problem solved it with this:Thats a pretty way to inject i guesse.
