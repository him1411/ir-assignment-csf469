I have to concatenate these two strings from my resource/value files:I do it this way :But the spaces at the end of the first string and at the beginning of the second string\nhave disappeared (when the Toast is shown) ...What should I do ?I guess the answer is somewhere here :\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/regex/package-descr.html#impnotesor is it something like using & for the "&" caracter ??Even if you use string formatting, sometimes you still need white spaces at the beginning or the end of your string. For these cases, neither escaping with \\, nor xml:space attribute helps. You must use HTML entity &#160; for a whitespace.Use &#160; for non-breakable whitespace.\nUse &#032; for regular space.I ran into the same issue. I wanted to leave a blank at the end of a resource string representing an on-screen field name.I found a solution on this issue report : https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/124This is the same idea that Duessi suggests. Insert \\u0020 directly in the XML for a blank you would like to preserve.Example : The replacement is done at build time, therefore it will not affect the performance of your game.This documentation: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.htmlsuggests quoting will work:I just use the UTF code for space "\\u0020" in the strings.xml file.works great. (Android loves UTF codes)If you really want to do it the way you were doing then I think you have to tell it that the whitespace is relevant by escaping it:However, I\'d use string formatting for this. Something like the following:thenThere is possible to space with different width:| SPACE | THIN SPACE | HAIR SPACE | no space |Visualisation:use "" with the string resource value.Example : \n   "value with spaces"OR use \\u0020 code for spaces.All answers here did not work for me.  Instead, to add a space at the end of a string in XML i did this I\'ve no idea about Android in particular, but this looks like the usual XML whitespace handling - leading and trailing whitespace within an element is generally considered insignificant and removed. Try xml:space:An argument can be made for adding the space programmatically. Since these cases will be often used in concatenations, I decided to stop the madness and just do the old + " " +. These will make sense in most European languages, I would gather.It does not work with xml:space="preserve"so I did it the quickest way =>I simply added a +" "+ where I needed it ...
