I need to have a valid SSL certificate, by valid I mean not self signed. I don\'t want my customers to have to deal with the \'exception\'.How much does it cost? I\'m bit lost because I checked on Verisign and it costs around ~1000$ while I can find others from 30$.Any ideas? By the way I\'m currently located in France, if that matters.The value of the certificate comes mostly from the trust of the internet users in the issuer of the certificate. To that end, Verisign is tough to beat. A certificate says to the client that you are who you say you are, and the issuer has verified that to be true.You can get a free SSL certificate signed, for example, by StartSSL. This is an improvement on self-signed certificates, because your end-users would stop getting warning pop-ups informing them of a suspicious certificate on your end. However, the browser bar is not going to turn green when communicating with your site over https, so this solution is not ideal.The cheapest SSL certificate that turns the bar green will cost you a few hundred dollars, and you would need to go through a process of proving the identity of your company to the issuer of the certificate by submitting relevant documents.Let\'s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority made by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG). It is sponsored by well-known organisations such as Mozilla, Cisco or Google Chrome. Most modern browsers are compatible.Let\'s Encrypt is in public beta since December 2015, which means everyone can get their certificates for free. The setup will be very easy, you just have to verify that you own the website. Some minutes later, you get your certificate.There are many clients you can use to install a Let\'s Encrypt certificate:Let\xe2\x80\x99s Encrypt uses the ACME protocol to verify that you control a given domain name and to issue you a certificate. To get a Let\xe2\x80\x99s Encrypt certificate, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to choose a piece of ACME client software to use.\n  - https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/As of 6th July, they also offer wildcard certificates. Domain validaiton is done via DNS.You are really asking a couple of questions here:1) Why does the price of SSL certificates vary so much2) Where can I get good, cheap SSL certificates?The first question is a good one. For example, the type of SSL certificate you buy is important. Many SSL certificates are domain verified only - that is, the company issuing the certificate only validate that you own the domain. They don\'t validate your identity, so people visiting your site might know that the domain has a SSL certificate, but that doesn\'t mean the person behing the website isn\'t a scammer or phisher, for example. This is why the Verisign solution is much more expensive - you are getting a cert that not only secures your site, but validates the identity of the owner of the site (well, that\'s the claim). You can read more on this subject hereFor your second question, I can personally recommend RapidSSL. I\'ve bought several certificates from them in the past and they are, well, rapid. However, you should always do your research first. A company based in France might be better for you to deal with as you can get support in your local hours, etc.
