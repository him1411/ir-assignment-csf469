What\'s the AngularJS way to access cookies?  I\'ve seen references to both a service and a module for cookies, but no examples.  Is there, or is there not an AngularJS canonical approach?This answer has been updated to reflect latest stable angularjs version. One important note is that $cookieStore is a thin wrapper surrounding $cookies. They are pretty much the same in that they only work with session cookies. Although, this answers the original question, there are other solutions you may wish to consider such as using localstorage, or jquery.cookie plugin (which would give you more fine-grained control and do serverside cookies. Of course doing so in angularjs means you probably would want to wrap them in a service and use $scope.apply to notify angular of changes to models (in some cases).One other note and that is that there is a slight difference between the two when pulling data out depending on if you used $cookie to store value or $cookieStore. Of course, you\'d really want to use one or the other.In addition to adding reference to the js file you need to inject ngCookies into your app definition such as: you should then be good to go.Here is a functional minimal example, where I show that cookieStore is a thin wrapper around cookies:The steps are:This is how you can set and get cookie values. This is what I was originally looking for when I found this question.Note we use $cookieStore instead of $cookiesAngular deprecated $cookieStore in version 1.4.x, so use $cookies instead if you are using latest version of angular. Syntax remain same for $cookieStore & $cookies:  See the Docs for an API overview. Mind also that the cookie service has been enhanced with some new important features like setting expiration (see this answer) and domain (see CookiesProvider Docs).Note that, in version 1.3.x or below, $cookies has a different syntax than above: Also if you are using bower, make sure to type your package name correctly: where X.Y.Z is the AngularJS version you are running. \nThere\'s another package in bower "angular-cookie"(without the \'s\') which is not the official angular package. FYI, I put together a JSFiddle of this using the $cookieStore, two controllers, a $rootScope, and AngularjS 1.0.6. It\'s on JSFifddle as http://jsfiddle.net/krimple/9dSb2/ as a base if you\'re messing around with this...The gist of it is:JavascriptHTMLhttp://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngCookies.$cookieStoreMake sure you include http://code.angularjs.org/1.0.0rc10/angular-cookies-1.0.0rc10.js to use it.AngularJS provides ngCookies module and $cookieStore service to use Browser Cookies.We need to add angular-cookies.min.js file to use cookie feature.Here is some method of AngularJS Cookie.get(key); // This method returns the value of given cookie key.getObject(key); //This method returns the deserialized value of given\ncookie key.getAll(); //This method returns a key value object with all the\ncookies.put(key, value, [options]); //This method sets a value for given\ncookie key.remove(key, [options]); //This method remove given cookie.Example HtmlJavaScriptI have Taken reference from http://www.tutsway.com/simple-example-of-cookie-in-angular-js.php.Add angular cookie lib : angular-cookies.jsYou can use $cookies or $cookieStore parameter to the respective controllerMain controller add this inject \'ngCookies\':Use Cookies in your controller like this way:The original accepted answer mentions jquery.cookie plugin. A few months ago though, it was renamed to js-cookie and the jQuery dependency removed. One of the reasons was just to make it easy to integrate with other frameworks, like Angular.Now, if you want to integrate js-cookie with angular, it is as easy as something like:And that\'s it. No jQuery. No ngCookies.You can also create custom instances to handle specific server-side cookies that are written differently. Take for example PHP, that convert the spaces  in the server-side to a plus sign + instead of also percent-encode it:The usage for a custom Provider would be something like this:I hope this helps anyone.See detailed info in this issue: https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie/issues/103For detailed docs on how to integrate with server-side, see here: https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie/blob/master/SERVER_SIDE.mdHere\'s a simple example using $cookies. After clicking on button, the cookie is saved, and then restored after page is reloaded.app.html:app.js:
