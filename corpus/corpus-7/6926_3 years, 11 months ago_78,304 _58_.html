I want to install Lxml so I can then install Scrapy.When I updated my Mac today it wouldn\'t let me reinstall lxml, I get the following error:I have tried using brew to install libxml2 and libxslt, both installed fine but I still cannot install lxml.Last time I was installing I needed to enable the developer tools on Xcode but since its updated to Xcode 5 it doesnt give me that option anymore.Does anyone know what I need to do?You should install or upgrade the commandline tool for xcode.\nTry this in a terminal:I solved this issue on Yosemite by both installing and linking libxml2 and libxslt through brew:If you have solved the problem using this method but it pops up again at a later time, you might need to run this before the four lines above:If you are having permission errors with Homebrew, especially on El Capitan, this is a helpful document. In essence, regardless of OS X version, try running:You may solve your problem by running this on the commandline:It sure helped me.\nExplanations on docsI tried most of the solutions above, but none of them worked for me. I\'m running Yosemite 10.10, the only solution that worked for me was to type this in the terminal:EDIT: If you are using virtualenv, the sudo in beginning is not needed.This has been bothering me as well for a while.  I don\'t know the internals enough about python distutils etc, but the include path here is wrong.  I made the following ugly hack to hold me over until the python lxml people can do the proper fix.Installing globally... OS X 10.9.2instalation instructions on http://lxml.de/installation.html explain:To speed up the build in test environments, e.g. on a continuous integration server, disable the C compiler optimisations by setting the CFLAGS environment variable:None of the above worked for me on 10.9.2, as compilation bails out with following error: Which actually lead to cleanest solution (see more details in [1]): or following if installing globally[1] clang error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' (python package installation failure)I solved this issue on Yosemite by running the following commands:OSX 10.9.2I tried all the answers on this page, none of them worked for me. I\'m running OS X Version 10.9.2But this definitely works....like a charm:ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future pip install lxmlUnfortunately xcode-select --install did not work for me as I already had the latest version.It\'s very strange but I solved the issue by opening XCode and accepting the Terms & Conditions. Re-running pip install lxml returned no errors after.With homebrew, libxml2 is hidden to not interfere with the system libxml2, so pip must be helped a little in order to find it.With bash:With fish:I am using OSX 10.9.2 and I get the same error.Installation of the XCode command line tools does not help for this particular version of OSX.I think a better approach to fix this is to install with the following command:This is similar to jdkoftinoff\' fix, but does not alter your system in a permanent way.I met the same question and after days of working I resolved this problem on my OS X 10.9.4, with Python 3.4.1.Here\'s my solution,According to installing lxml from lxml.de,A macport of lxml is available. Try something like port install py25-lxmlIf you do not have MacPort, install it from MacPort.org. It\'s quite easy. You may also need a compiler, to install XCode compiling tools, use xcode-select --installFirstly I updated my port to the latest version via sudo port selfupdate, Then I just type sudo port install libxml2 and several minutes later you should see libxml2 installed successfully. Probably you may also need libxslt to install lxml. To install libxslt, use:sudo port install libxslt.Now, just type pip install lxml, it should work fine.before compiling add the path that to xmlversion.h into your environment.But make sure the path I\'ve provided has the xmlversion.h file located inside. Then,pip did not work for me. I went to\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/2.3\nand downloaded the macosx .egg file:https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/l/lxml/lxml-2.3-py2.7-macosx-10.6-intel.egg#md5=52322e4698d68800c6b6aedb0dbe5f34Then used command line easy_install to install the .egg file.This post links to a solution that worked for me\nPython3, lxml and "Symbol not found: _lzma_auto_decoder" on Mac OS X 10.9hthAfter successful install from pip (lxml 3.6.4) I was getting an error when importing the lxml.etree module.I was searching endlessly to install this as a requisite for scrapy, and tried all the options, but finally this worked for me (mac osx 10.11 python 2.7):The older version of lxml seem to work with etree module. Pip can often ignore the specified version of a package, for example when you have the newer version in the pip cache, thus the easy_install. The \'-2.7\' option is for python version, omit this if you are installing for python 3.x. In my case, I must shutdown Kaspersky Antivirus before installing lxml by:Try:Or:It works!
