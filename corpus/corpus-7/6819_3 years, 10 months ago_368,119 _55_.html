I am calling a function like the one below by click on divs with a certain class. Is there a way I can check when starting the function if a user is using Internet Explorer and abort / cancel it if they are using other browsers so that it only runs for IE users ? The users here would all be on IE8 or higher versions so I would not need to cover IE7 and lower versions.If I could tell which browser they are using that would be great but is not required.Example function:Use below JavaScript method : You may find the details on below Microsoft support site : How to determine browser version from scriptUpdate : (IE 11 support)As of Internet Explorer 12+ (aka Edge), the User Agent String has changed, once again.Sample usage:Default string of IE 10:Default string of IE 11:Default string of IE 12 (aka Edge):Default string of Edge 13 (thx @DrCord):Default string of Edge 14:Test at CodePen:http://codepen.io/gapcode/pen/vEJNZNJust adding onto Mario\'s extremely helpful answer. If all you want to know is if the browser is IE or not, the code can be simplified down to just:This returns true for any version of Internet Explorer:The userAgent parameter is optional and it defaults to the browser\'s user agent.You can use the navigator object to detect user-navigator, you don\'t need jquery for ithttp://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/navigator.shtmlMethod 01:\n$.browser was deprecated in jQuery version 1.3 and removed in 1.9 Method 02:\nUsing Conditional CommentsMethod 03: Method 04: \nUse JavaScript/Manual DetectionReference LinkUsing the answers above; simple & condensed returning Boolean:var isIE = /(MSIE|Trident\\/|Edge\\/)/i.test(navigator.userAgent);Using modernizrThis is how the Angular team is doing it (v 1.5.5):Then there are several lines of code scattered throughout using it as a number such as andI know this is an old question, but in case anyone comes across it again and has issues with detecting IE11, here is a working solution for all current versions of IE.If you don\'t want to use the useragent, you could also just do this for checking if the browser is IE.  The commented code actually runs in IE browsers and turns the "false" to "true".i\'ve used this @SpiderCode\'s solution does not work with IE 11. Here is the best solution that I used henceforth in my code where I need browser detection for particular feature.IE11 no longer reports as MSIE, according to this list of changes, it\'s intentional to avoid mis-detection.What you can do if you really want to know it\'s IE is to detect the Trident/ string in the user agent if navigator.appName returns Netscape, something like (the untested);Thanks to this answerBelow I found elegant way of doing this while googling ---Many answers here, and I\'d like to add my input. IE 11 was being such an ass concerning flexbox (see all its issues and inconsistencies here) that I really needed an easy way to check if a user is using any IE browser (up to and including 11) but excluding Edge, because Edge is actually pretty nice.Based on the answers given here, I wrote a simple function returning a global boolean variable which you can then use down the line. It\'s very easy to check for IE.This way you only have to do the look up once, and you store the result in a variable, rather than having to fetch the result on each function call. (As far as I know you don\'t even have to wait for document ready to execute this code as the user-agent is not related to the DOM.)Try this if you are using jquery version >=1.9,If using jQuery version <1.9 ($.browser was removed in jQuery 1.9) use the following code instead:You can dectect all Internet Explorer (Last Version Tested 12).See here https://jsfiddle.net/v7npeLwe/You should see the result in console, please use chrome Inspect.I\'ve placed this code in the document ready function and it only triggers in internet explorer. Tested in Internet Explorer 11.Update to SpiderCode\'s answer to fix issues where the string \'MSIE\' returns -1 but it matches \'Trident\'. It used to return NAN, but now returns 11 for that version of IE.Try doing like thisYou can use $.browser to get name, vendor and version information.See http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
