In the Heroku free apps the dynos seem to keep idling - my app has very low traffic but it\'s also not really acceptable in my case that my users have to wait 20+ seconds to spin up a new dyno. Frankly, with that kind of wait, many will leave before the first page even displays.So, I have a problem: should I be paying $36 a month to save each user an embarrassingly long 20 seconds when my traffic is in the single-digits per day.Is there a way around this??You can install the free New Relic add-on. It has an availability monitor feature that will ping your site twice per minute, thus preventing the dyno from idling.More or less the same solution as Jesse but maybe more integrated to Heroku... And with a few perks (performance monitoring is just great).Note: to all those saying it doesn\'t work: the important part in my answer is "availability monitor". Just installing the addon won\'t help. You also need to setup the availability monitoring with the URL of your heroku app. As an alternative to Pingdom I suggest trying Uptimerobot. It is free and offers 5 min interval site checking. It works very fine for me.UPDATE 7th of May 2015: This will not be possible any more, as Heroku will change their free dyno to prevent keeping it alive for full 24 hours:Another important change has to do with dyno sleeping, or \xe2\x80\x98idling\xe2\x80\x99. While non-paid apps have always slept after an activity timeout, some apps used automatic pinging services to prevent that behavior. free dynos are allowed 18 hours awake per 24 hour period, and over the next few weeks we will begin to notify users of apps that exceed that limit. With the introduction of the hobby dyno ($7 per month), we are asking to either let your app sleep after time out, or upgrade to this new option.When is this going to be live? According to their blog post:Applications running a single 1X dyno that don\xe2\x80\x99t accumulate any other\n  dyno charges will be migrated gradually to the new free dynos\n  beginning on July 1.In my opinion, using the \'free\' tier of the service should not be powering a production or customer facing application.  While the above solutions work against the Dyno idling, think thoroughly about what you\'re doing.If nothing else, use a cron job to ping your site, and disable the check for known low-use periods (ie, overnight) to ensure Heroku doesn\'t do away with the free tier for everyone else.You can also try http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com, it\'s made for preventing Heroku apps to go to sleep. It will ping your app every 10 minutes so your app won\'t go to sleep. It\'s completely free.You can use http://pingdom.com/ to check your app; if done every minute or so, heroku won\'t idle your app and won\'t need to spin-up.Easy answer--if you value the service then pay for it.  All these \'tricks\' to get the benefits of paid service...well it\'s essentially like stealing cable.  Questionable to even list them here.  What\'s next, tricks on how to pirate games?Like another poster here, I value the free service for development and testing and I will be greatly annoyed at all you ethics-impaired types if Heroku does away with it because there are too many freeloaders.  I just don\'t think he was direct enough in his criticism.Tested and working on my own Heroku app using Node.js 0.10.x on 6/28/2013It says in Heroku documentation that having more than 1 web dyno will never idle out. Possibly a cheaper solution than $0.09/hour like Pierre suggests.DocumentationI have written down the steps:\xe2\x9e\x9c Add gem \'newrelic_rpm\' to your Gemfile under staging & production\n\xe2\x9e\x9c bundle install\n\xe2\x9e\x9c Login to heroku control panel and add newrelic addon\n\xe2\x9e\x9c Once added, setup automatic pinging to your website so that it does not idle\n\xe2\x9e\x9c Browse to Menu > Availability Monitoring (under Settings)\n\xe2\x86\x92 Click \xe2\x80\x9cTurn on Availability Monitoring\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x9e\x9c Enter the url to ping (eg: http://spokenvote.org)\n\xe2\x9e\x9c Select 1 minute for the interval  Note that the new dyno types (currently in beta, incoming in June 2015) will forbid to keep a free dyno awoken 24/7, as it would have to sleep at least 6 hours per day.So try to remove any solution you found in this thread before this comes out (or pay for the service you actually use).I use the Heroku Scheduler addon provided by Heroku for free. Once added it is simple as creating a job with \'curl http://yourapp.herokuapp.com\' and a 10 min interval.I found another free site that will constantly ping your site called Unidlerhttp://unidler.herokuapp.com/Same as pingdom, but doesnt need to log in.this work for me in a spring application making one http request every 2 minute to the root url path\n`Remember config your context to enable scheduler and create the bean for your schedulerIf you have access to a unix server that\'s always up, you can set a cron job to GET your website.  Under the new terms of the free plan, you\'ll probably want to disable the GETs in the night hours, using a line in your crontab like this:This instructs curl to GET domain.com every 20 minutes between the hours of 8 and 22.Be aware thatAlso, make sure your system time is set up properly so that the down-time window happens when you expect it to.Guy, here is a heroku app you can run to keep multiple heroku apps alive. Just add the urls you want to ping in the config.json.https://github.com/jcarras/rise-and-shineI have an app that only needs to run from monday to friday around lunchtime.\nI just added the following script to the crontab at work:So for any app just drop another line in your crontab like:
