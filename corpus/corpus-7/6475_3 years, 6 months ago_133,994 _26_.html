I\'m using Git-1.9.0-preview20140217 for Windows. As I know, this release should fix the issue with too long filenames. But not for me.Surely I\'m doing something wrong: I did git config core.longpaths true and git add . then git commit. Everything went well. But when I now do a git status, I get a list of files with Filename too long, e.g.It is quite simple to reproduce for me: just create a yeoman web app with the angular-generator ("yo angular") and remove node_modules from the .gitignore file. Then repeating the aforementioned git commands.What am I missing here?Git has a limit of 4096 characters for a filename, except on windows when git is compiled with msys. It uses an older version of the windows api and there\'s a limit of 260 characters for a filename.So as far as I understand this, it\'s a limitation of msys and not of git. You can read the details here:\nhttps://github.com/msysgit/git/pull/110You can circumvent this by using another git-client on windows.You should be able to run the commandor add it to one of your git config files manually to turn this functionality on, once you are on a supported version of git. It looks like maybe 1.9.0 and after.This might help :Basic Explanation: This answer suggests not to have such setting applied to the global system (to all projects so avoiding --system or --global tag) configurations. This command only solves the problem by being specific to the current project.create .gitconfig and addYou can create file in project location(not sure) and also in global location in my case location is c:Users{name}\\The better solution is enable the longpath parameter from git.But a work arround that works is remove node_modules folter from git.Add node_modules in new row inside .gitignore file. After do this, push your modifications.To be entirely sure that it takes effect immediately after the repository is initialized, but before the remote history is fetched or any files checked out, it is safer to use it this way:-c key=valueSet a configuration variable in the newly-created repository; this takes effect immediately after the repository is initialized, but\n  before the remote history is fetched or any files checked out. The key\n  is in the same format as expected by git-config1 (e.g.,\n  core.eol=true). If multiple values are given for the same key, each\n  value will be written to the config file. This makes it safe, for\n  example, to add additional fetch refspecs to the origin remote.More infoI had this error too but in my case the cause was using an outdated version of npm, v1.4.28.Updating to npm v3 followed byworked for me. npm issue 2697 has details of the "maximally flat" folder structure included in npm v3 (released 2015-06-25).You can try to temporarily move the local repo (the entire folder) to the root of your drive or as close to the root as possible. Since the path is smaller at the root of the drive, it sometimes fixes the issues.On windows, I\'d move this to C:\\ or another drive\'s root
