I\'m having trouble displaying the only date part of a DateTime into a textbox using TextBoxFor<,>(expression, htmlAttributes).The model is based on Linq2SQL, field is a DateTime on SQL and in the Entity model.Failed:This trick seems to be depreciated, any string value in the object htmlAttribute is ignored.Failed:I would like to store and display only the date part on the details/edit view, without the "00:00:00" part.Then:MVC4 has solved this problem by adding a new TextBoxFor overload, which takes a string format parameter. You can now simply do this:There\'s also an overload that takes html attributes, so you can set the CSS class, wire up datepickers, etc:Or use the untyped helpers:This worked for me.Don\'t be afraid of using raw HTML.You can also use the HTML 5 attributes by applying this data annotation:But the problem is this enables a browser specific date picker for HTML 5 browsers.  You still need your own date picker for browsers without support, and then you have to make sure your date picker doesn\'t appear in addition to a browser\'s (Modernizr can do this easily), or hide the browser\'s if it does(complicated and I don\'t know how reliable methods I saw were).  In the end I went with Alex\'s because my current environment doesn\'t have Modernizr, but if it did, I would have used that to conditionally only show my data picker if the browser didn\'t support one already.For me,  I needed to keep the TextboxFor() because using EditorFor() changes the input type to date.  Which, in Chrome, adds a built in date picker, which screwed up the jQuery datepicker that I was already using.  So, to continue using TextboxFor() AND only output the date, you can do this:The DisplayFormat attribute did not work for me in either form upon initial load.  I created an EditorTemplate instead:The Template Editor will work for display purposes only.\nIf you use the same editor (which makes sense because its an editor) and you supplied a value like 31/01/2010  - you\'ll get an error message saying the format is invalid.// datimetime displays in the datePicker is 11/24/2011 12:00:00 AM// you could split this by space and set the value to date onlyScript:Markup:Hopes this helps..Sure you can use Html.EditorFor.\nBut if you want to use TextBoxFor and use format from DisplayFormat attribute you can use it in this way:or create next extension:Just add next to your model.When using tag helpers in ASP.NET Core, the format needs specified in ISO format.  If not specified as such, bound input data won\'t display properly and will show as mm/dd/yyyy with no value.Model:View:The format can also be specified in the view using the asp-format attribute.The resulting HTML will look as follows:
