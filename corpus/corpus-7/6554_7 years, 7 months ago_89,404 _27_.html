I\'ve finished working on a feature branch feature-x. I want to merge results back to the default branch and close feature-x in order to get rid of it in the output of hg branches.I came up with the following scenario, but it has some issues:So the feature-x branch (changests 40-41) is closed, but there is one new head, the closing branch changeset 44, that will be listed in hg heads every time:Update: It appears that since version 1.5 Mercurial doesn\'t show heads of closed branches in the output of hg heads anymore.Is it possible to close a merged branch without leaving one more head? Is there more correct way to close a feature branch?Related questions:One way is to just leave merged feature branches open (and inactive):Another way is to close a feature branch before merging using an extra commit:The first one is simpler, but it leaves an open branch. The second one leaves no open heads/branches, but it requires one more auxiliary commit. One may combine the last actual commit to the feature branch with this extra commit using --close-branch, but one should know in advance which commit will be the last one.Update: Since Mercurial 1.5 you can close the branch at any time so it will not appear in both hg branches and hg heads anymore. The only thing that could possibly annoy you is that technically the revision graph will still have one more revision without childen.Update 2: Since Mercurial 1.8 bookmarks have become a core feature of Mercurial. Bookmarks are more convenient for branching than named branches. See also this question:imho there are two cases for branches that were forgot to closeCase 1:\n branch was not merged into defaultin this case I update to the branch and do another commit with --close-branch, unfortunatly this elects the branch to become the new tip and hence before pushing it to other clones I make sure that the real tip receives some more changes and others don\'t get confused about that strange tip.Case 2:\n branch was merged into defaultThis case is not that much different from case 1 and it can be solved by reproducing the steps for case 1 and two additional ones.in this case I update to the branch changeset, do another commit with --close-branch and merge the new changeset that became the tip into default. the last operation creates a new tip that is in the default branch - HOORAY!Hope this helps future readers.EDIT ouch, too late... I know read your comment stating that you want to keep the feature-x changeset around, so the cloning approach here doesn\'t work.I\'ll still let the answer here for it may help others.If you want to completely get rid of "feature X", because, for example, it didn\'t work, you can clone.  This is one of the method explained in the article and it does work, and it talks specifically about heads.As far as I understand you have this and want to get rid of the "feature-x" head once and for all:So you do this:And you\'ll have the following, and you\'ll see that feature-x is indeed gone:I may have misunderstood what you wanted but please don\'t mod down, I took time reproducing your use case : )It is strange, that no one yet has suggested the most robust way of closing a feature branches...\nYou can just combine merge commit with --close-branch flag (i.e. commit modified files and close the branch simultaneously):So, that is all. No one extra head on revgraph. No extra commit.
