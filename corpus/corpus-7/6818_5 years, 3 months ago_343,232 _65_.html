I want to bounce users of our web site to an error page if they\'re using a version of Internet Explorer prior to v9. It\'s just not worth our time and money to support IE pre-v9. Users of all other non-IE browsers are fine and shouldn\'t be bounced. Here\'s the proposed code:Will this code do the trick?To head off a few comments that will probably be coming my way:Any other obvious issues to be aware of?This is my preferred way of doing it. It gives maximum control. (Note: Conditional statements are only supported in IE5 - 9.)First set up your ie classes correctlyThen you can just use CSS to make style exceptions, or, if you require, you can add some simple JavaScript:Thanks to Paul Irish.Return IE version or if not IE return falseExample:oror If nobody else has added an addEventLister-method and you\'re using the correct browser mode then you could check for IE 8 or less withLegacy Internet Explorer and attachEvent (MDN)Use conditional comments. You\'re trying to detect users of IE < 9 and conditional comments will work in those browsers; in other browsers (IE >= 10 and non-IE), the comments will be treated as normal HTML comments, which is what they are.Example HTML:You can also do this purely with script, if you need:To detect MSIE (v6 - v7 - v8 - v9 - v10 - v11) easily : To reliably filter IE8 and older, checking global objects can be used:Here is the way AngularJS checks for IEDetect IE in JS using conditional commentsThis function will return the IE major version number as an integer, or undefined if the browser isn\'t Internet Explorer. This, like all user agent solutions, is suceptible to user agent spoofing (which has been an official feature of IE since version 8).This works for me. I use it as a redirect to a page that explains why we don\'t like < IE9 and provide links to browsers we prefer.Detecting IE version using feature detection (IE7+, browsers prior to IE7 are detected as 7):Edit: I\'ve created a bower/npm repo for your convenience: ie-versionYour code can do the check, but as you thought, if someone try to access your page using IE v1 or > v19 will not get the error, so might be more safely do the check with Regex expression like this code below:Conditional comments are no longer supported in IE as of Version 10 as noted on the Microsoft reference page.then use:For ie 10 and 11: You can use js and add a class in html to maintain the standard of conditional comments:Or use a lib like bowser:https://github.com/ded/bowserOr modernizr for feature detection: http://modernizr.com/To detect Internet Explorer 10|11 you can use this little script immediatelly after body tag:In my case i use jQuery library loaded in head. This has been answered to death, but this is all you need.According to Microsoft, following is the best solution, it is also very simple:I\'m going to recommend not rewriting this code for the umpteenth time. I would recommend you use the Conditionizr library (http://conditionizr.com/) which is capable of testing for specific IE versions as well as other browsers, operating systems, and even the presence or absence of Retina displays.Include the code for only the specific tests you need and you also gain the benefit of a tested library which has been through many iterations (and which would be easy to upgrade without breaking your code).It also meshes nicely with Modernizr which can handle all of those cases where you are better off testing for a specific capability rather than a specific browser.I do like that:This approach to detecting IE combines the strengths and avoids the weaknesses of jKey\'s answer using conditional comments and Owen\'s answer using user agents.Owen\'s approach can fail on IE 5 & 6 (reporting 7) and is susceptible to UA spoofing, but it can detect IE versions >= 10 (now also including 12, which postdates Owen\'s answer). This can be used to set useful classes to your document containing the IE version:Note that it detects the compatibility mode being used, if IE is in compatability mode. Also note that IE version is mostly useful for older versions (<10); higher versions are more standards-compliant and it\'s probably better to instead check for features using something like modernizr.js.I made a convenient underscore mixin for this.The most comprehensive JS script I found to check for versions of IE is http://www.pinlady.net/PluginDetect/IE/. The entire library is at http://www.pinlady.net/PluginDetect/Browsers/. With IE10, conditional statements are no longer supported.With IE11, the user agent no longer contains MSIE. Also, using the user agent is not reliable because that can be modified.Using the PluginDetect JS script, you can detect for IE and detect the exact versions by using very specific and well-crafted code that targets specific IE versions. This is very useful when you care exactly what version of browser you are working with.I realise I am a little late to the party here, but I had been checking out a simple one line way to provide feedback on whether a browser is IE and what version from 10 down it was. I haven\'t coded this for version 11, so perhaps a little amendment will be needed for that.However this is the code, it works as an object that has a property and a method and relies on object detection rather than scraping the navigator object (which is massively flawed as it can be spoofed).The usage is isIE.browser a property that returns a boolean and relies on conditional comments the method isIE.detectedVersion() which returns a number between 5 and 10. I am making the assumption that anything lower than 6 and you are in serious old school territory and you will something more beefy than a one liner and anything higher than 10 and you are in to newer territory. I have read something about IE11 not supporting conditional comments but I\'ve not fully investigated, that is maybe for a later date.Anyway, as it is, and for a one liner, it will cover the basics of IE browser and version detection. It\'s far from perfect, but it is small and easily amended.Just for reference, and if anyone is in any doubt on how to actually implement this then the following conditional should help. Detecting IE and its versions couldn\'t be easier, and all you need is a bit of native/vanilla Javascript: And this is a way to use it: . Works in all IE versions, including higher versions in lower Compatability View/Mode, and documentMode is IE proprietary.  If you need to delect IE Browser version then you can follow below code. This code working well for version IE6 to IE11 Window runs IE10 will be auto update to IE11+ and will be standardized W3CNowaday, we don\'t need to support IE8-
