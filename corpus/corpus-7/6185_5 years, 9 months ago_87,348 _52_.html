I am using jQuery SVG. I can\'t add or remove a class to an object. Anyone know my mistake?The SVG:The jQuery that won\'t add the class:I know the SVG and jQuery are working together fine because I can target the object and fire an alert when it\'s clicked:JQuery can\'t add a class to an SVG..attr() works with SVG, so if you want to depend on jQuery:And if you don\'t want to depend on jQuery:Edit 2016: read the next two answers.There is element.classList in the DOM API that works for both HTML and SVG elements. No need for jQuery SVG plugin or even jQuery.One of the changes listed on the jQuery 3.0 revisions is:add SVG class manipulation (#2199, 20aaed3)One solution for this issue would be to upgrade to jQuery 3. It works great:The reason the jQuery class manipulation functions do not work with the SVG elements is because jQuery versions prior to 3.0 use the className property for these functions.This behaves as expected for HTML elements, but for SVG elements className is a little different. For an SVG element, className is not a string, but an instance of SVGAnimatedString.If you run this code you will see something like the following in your developer console.If we were to cast that SVGAnimatedString object to a string as jQuery does, we would have [object SVGAnimatedString], which is where jQuery fails.The jQuery SVG plugin works around this by patching the relevant functions to add SVG support.This function will detect if an element is an SVG element, and if it is it will use the baseVal property of the SVGAnimatedString object if available, before falling back on the class attribute.jQuery currently lists this issue on their Won\xe2\x80\x99t Fix page. Here is the relevant parts.jQuery is primarily a library for the HTML DOM, so most problems related to SVG/VML documents or namespaced elements are out of scope. We do try to address problems that "bleed through" to HTML documents, such as events that bubble out of SVG.Evidently jQuery considers full SVG support outside the scope of the jQuery core, and better suited for plugins.If you have dynamic classes or don\'t know what classes could be already applied then this method I believe is the best approach:Based on above answers I created the following APIAfter loading jquery.svg.js you must load this file: http://keith-wood.name/js/jquery.svgdom.js.Source: http://keith-wood.name/svg.html#domWorking example: http://jsfiddle.net/74RbC/99/Just add the missing prototype constructor to all SVG nodes:You can then use it this way without requiring jQuery:All credit goes to Todd Moto.jQuery does not support the classes of SVG elements. You can get the element directly $(el).get(0) and use classList and add / remove. There is a trick with this too in that the topmost SVG element is actually a normal DOM object and can be used like every other element in jQuery. In my project I created this to take care of what I needed but the documentation provided on the Mozilla Developer Network has a shim that can be used as an alternative.exampleAn alternative all tougher is to use D3.js as your selector engine instead. My projects have charts that are built with it so it\'s also in my app scope. D3 correctly modifies the class attributes of vanilla DOM elements and SVG elements. Though adding D3 for just this case would likely be overkill.The jQuery 2.2 and 1.12 Released post includes the following quote:While jQuery is a HTML library, we agreed that class support for SVG elements could be useful. Users will now be able to call the .addClass(), .removeClass(), .toggleClass(), and .hasClass() methods on SVG. jQuery now changes the class attribute rather than the className property. This also makes the class methods usable in general XML documents. Keep in mind that many other things will not work with SVG, and we still recommend using a library dedicated to SVG if you need anything beyond class manipulation.It tests:If you click on that small square, it will change its color because the class attribute is added / removed.Here is my rather inelegant but working code that deals with the following issues (without any dependencies):It uses classList where possible.Code:Example usage:I use Snap.svg to add a class to and SVG.http://snapsvg.io/docs/#Element.addClassOne workaround could be to addClass to a container of the svg element:Inspired by the answers above, especially by Sagar Gala, I\'ve created this API. You may use it if you don\'t want or can\'t upgrade your jquery version.Or just use old-school DOM methods when JQ has a monkey in the middle somewhere.Learn the DOM people. Even in 2016\'s framework-palooza it helps quite regularly. Also, if you ever hear someone compare the DOM to assembly, kick them for me.I wrote this in my project, and it works... probably;)examples
