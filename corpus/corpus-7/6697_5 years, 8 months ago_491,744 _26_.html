I have to run a Python script on a Windows server. How can I know which version of Python I have, and does it even really matter? I was thinking of updating to latest version of Python.http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#generic-options--version may also work (introduced in version 2.5)Python 2.5+:Python 2.4-:in a Python IDE just copy and paste in the following code and run it (the version will come up in the output area)At a command prompt type:When I open Python (command line) the first thing it tells me is the version.Although the question is "which version am I using?", this may not actually be everything you need to know. You may have other versions installed and this can cause problems, particularly when installing additional modules. This is my rough-and-ready approach to finding out what versions are installed:The output for a single Python installation should look something like this:Multiple installations will have output something like this:or NOTE :- Please note that the "V" in python-V command is capital V. python -v (small "v") will launch Python in verbose mode.so from the command line:you can get version of python by using following commandYou can even get version of any package installed in venv using pip freeze asor using python interpreter asjust start it at terminalIn Short : Type python in command promptSimply open command prompt (Clr + R) and type cmd and and in command prompt then typing  python will give you all necessary info regarding versions For me. open CMD and run\n        py\nit will show something like\n       Python 3.4.3 (v3.4.3:9b73f1c3e601, Feb 24 2015, 22:43:06) [MSC v.1600 32 bit (Intel)] on win32\n        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.On Windows 10 with Python 3.6Open a command prompt window (press Windows+R, type in cmd, and hit enter).\nType python.exe If you have Python installed then the easiest way you can check the version number is by typing "python" in your command prompt. It will show you the version number and if it is running on 32 bit or 64 bit and some other information. For some applications you would want to have a latest version and sometimes not. It depends on what packages you want to install or use.
