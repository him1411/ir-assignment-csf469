But what about methods?Press SHIFT TWO times and you can search anything, both class and method in the project.ctrl + F12 (cmd + F12 on macOS) will show all members of the current class in a popup windown and let you pick up one. It works exactly like the ctrl + o shortcut in eclipse, much faster than ctrl + alt + shift + nCtrl + Alt + Shift + N allows you to search for symbols, including methods.The primary advantage of this more complicated keybinding is that is searches in all files, not just the current file as Ctrl + F12 does.(And as always, for Mac you substitute Cmd for Ctrl for these keybindings.)Command + Option + OOpens up the Symbol lookup that you can jump to most of the methods/functions in your currently opened document.IntelliJ IDEA Version 12.13 Ultimate Edition:Macs:\ncommand + option + shift + N\nor on Menu -> Navigate > Symbol ... Slightly beside the actual question, but nonetheless useful: The Help menu of Intellij has an option \'Default Keymap reference\', which opens a PDF with the complete mapping.

Intellij v 13.1.4, OSXThe Open Symbol keyboard shortcut is \ncommand+shift+sCtrl + Shift + Alt + 7 after selecting the methodIf I need navigate to method in currently opened class, I use this combination: alt+7(open structure view, press double time - first time open, second time focus on view), type name of methods, select on of needed.CTRL + F12 brings up the File Structure navigation menu, which lets you search for members of the currently open file.
