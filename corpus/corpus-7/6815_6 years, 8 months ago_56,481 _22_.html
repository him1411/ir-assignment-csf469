Dave Ward says,It\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly light reading, but section 4.2 of RFC 3986 provides for fully qualified URLs that omit protocol (the HTTP or HTTPS) altogether. When a URL\xe2\x80\x99s protocol is omitted, the browser uses the underlying document\xe2\x80\x99s protocol instead.Put simply, these \xe2\x80\x9cprotocol-less\xe2\x80\x9d URLs allow a reference like this to work in every browser you\xe2\x80\x99ll try it in://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.jsIt looks strange at first, but this \xe2\x80\x9cprotocol-less\xe2\x80\x9d URL is the best way to reference third party content that\xe2\x80\x99s available via both HTTP and HTTPS.This would certainly solve a bunch of mixed-content errors we\'re seeing on HTTP pages -- assuming that our assets are available via both HTTP and HTTPS.Is this completely cross-browser compatible? Are there any other caveats?I tested it thoroughly before publishing.  Of all the browsers available to test against on Browsershots, I could only find one that did not handle the protocol relative URL correctly: an obscure *nix browser called Dillo.There are two drawbacks I\'ve received feedback about:The question of whether one could change all their links to be protocol-relative may be moot, considering the question of whether one should do so. According to Paul Irish:2014.12.17: Now that SSL is encouraged for everyone and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have performance concerns, this technique is now an anti-pattern. If the\n  asset you need is available on SSL, then always use the https://\n  asset.If you use protocol-less URLs to load stylesheets, IE 7 & 8 will download them twice:\nhttp://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/02/10/5a-missing-schema-double-download/So, this is to be avoided for CSS if you like good performance.Yes, network-path references were already specified in RFC 1808 and should work with all browsers.Is this completely cross-browser compatible? Are there any other caveats?Just to throw this in the mix, if you are developing on a local server, it might not work. You need to specify a scheme, otherwise the browser may assume that src="//cdn.example.com/js_file.js" is src="file://cdn.example.com/js_file.js", which will break since you\'re not hosting this resource locally.Microsoft Internet Explorer seem to be particularly sensitive to this, see this question: Not able to load jQuery in Internet Explorer on localhost (WAMP)You would probably always try to find a solution that works on all your environments with the least amount of modifications needed.The solution used by HTML5Boilerplate is to have a fallback when the resource is not loaded correctly, but that only works if you incorporate a check:I posted this answer here as well.UPDATE: HTML5Boilerplate now uses <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"> after deciding to deprecate protocol relative URLs, see here.I have not had these issues when using ://domain.com - but you do need to add the colon at the beginning. Yoast had a good write up about this a while back. But it\'s lost in his pile of blog posts.
