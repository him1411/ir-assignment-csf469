I\'m trying to generate a custom dialog in Android. \nI create my Dialog like this:Everythings works fine except for the title of the Dialog.\nEven if I don\'t set the title of the dialog the dialog popup has a blank space at the position of the dialog. Is there any way to hide this part of the Dialog? I tried it with an AlertDialog but it seems the layout is not set properly: If I use this code I get a null Pointer Exception in the last line.  The dialog is not null so the TextView I try to retrieve does not exist.\nIf I uncomment the part where I use the Dialog Constructor everything works fine but for the title above my dialog layout.You can hide the title of a dialog using:dialog.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);Previous version of this answer, which is overcomplicated:You need to use an AlertDialog. There\'s a good explanation on the Android Developer\'s site about custom dialogs.In very short summary, you do this with code like copied below from the official website. That takes a custom layot file, inflates it, gives it some basic text and icon, then creates it. You\'d show it then with alertDialog.show().In response to comment:I assume that TextView with the id nr is in the View you are inflating with View view = inflater..... If so, then you need to change just one bit: instead of dialog.findView... make it view.findView.... Then once you\'ve done that, remember to use dialog.show(), or even builder.show() without bothering to do builder.create().FEATURE_NO_TITLE works when creating a dialog from scratch, as in:But it doesn\'t work when creating an AlertDialog (or using the Builder), because it already disables the title and use a custom one internally.I have looked at the SDK sources, and I think that it can\'t be worked around. So to remove the top spacing, the only solution is to create a custom dialog from scratch IMO, by using the Dialog class directly.Also, one can do that with a style, eg in styles.xml:And then:In your code add this lineOr in XML use a themeXML would be a better implementation as with the code version the title bar gets created and then removed which is a waste of resourceOk good try but it is not working. I\n  get:\n  android.view.WindowManager$BadTokenException:\n  Unable to add window -- token null is\n  not for an application if I want to\n  shwo the dialog.Change the alert dialog type to system dialog ( e.g., TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY ) and see if this resolves your issueUse like this:This will remove any title bar from dialog window.Use below code before setcontentview :-Note: You must have above code, in same order and line.\n requestWindowFeature must be before the setContentView line.you can remove title bywhere dialog is name of my dialog .In your code if you use requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);  be sure that it goes before dialog.setContentView(); otherwise it causes the application to crash.I found Three Way to do this >1) Using requestWindowFeature2) Using style (style.xml)3) Using XML theme in AndroidManifest.xmlIn your Custom_Dialog.java class add requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE)olivierg\'s answer worked for me and is the best solution if creating a custom Dialog class is the route you want to go.  However, it bothered me that I couldn\'t use the AlertDialog class. I wanted to be able to use the default system AlertDialog style. Creating a custom dialog class would not have this style.So I found a solution (hack) that will work without having to create a custom class, you can use the existing builders.The AlertDialog puts a View above your content view as a placeholder for the title. If you find the view and set the height to 0, the space goes away.I have tested this on 2.3 and 3.0 so far, it is possible it doesn\'t work on every version yet.Here are two helper methods for doing it:Here is an example of how it is used:If you are using this with a DialogFragment, override the DialogFragment\'s onCreateDialog method. Then create and return your dialog like the first example above. The only change is that you should pass false as the 3rd parameter (show) so that it doesn\'t call show() on the dialog.  The DialogFragment will handle that later.Example:As I test this further I\'ll be sure to update with any additional tweaks needed.I don\'t know if this question is still actual, but in my case, when I switched from Dialog to DialogFragment,was not an option, but I could useinstead with the same result.Set the title to empty string using builder.set the "gravity" attribute on the entire dialog to "center".  Then you will need to override that setting to all of the child components in the dialog that you do not want centered.in XML use a themeIf we simply use the dialog without the setTitle(),then is that gonna work in removing the space of the title ?Think you can just use this now:You Can do this without using AlertDialog by defining new Class that extends from Dialog Class like this:creates a title less dialogWhile using AlertDialog, not using setTitle() makes the title disappearAfter a bunch of hacking, I got this to work:Here\'s something you can do with AlertBuilder to make the title disappear:
