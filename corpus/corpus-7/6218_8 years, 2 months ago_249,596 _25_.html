I have a collection of checkboxes with generated ids and some of them have an extra attribute. Is it possible to use JQuery to check if an element has a specific attribute?\nFor example, can I verify if the following element has the attribute "myattr"? The value of the attribute can vary.For example how can I get a collection of all checkboxes that have this attribute without checking one by one? Is this possible?Do you mean can you select them? If so, then yes:EDIT:The above will fall into the else-branch when myattr exists but is an empty string or "0". If that\'s a problem you should explicitly test on undefined:I know it\'s been a long time since the question was asked, but I found the check to be clearer like this :(As found on this site here)Documentation about is can be found hereIn JavaScript,......returns true*. It\'s the difference between == and ===. Also, the name undefined can be defined (it\'s not a keyword like null is) so you\'re better off checking some other way. The most reliable way is probably to compare the return value of the typeof operator.Nevertheless, comparing to null should work in this case.* Assuming undefined is in fact undefined.This will work:$("input[attr]").length might be a better option.A couple ideas were tossed around using "typeof", jQuery ".is" and ".filter" so I thought I would post up a quick perf compare of them. The typeof appears to be the best choice for this. While the others will work, there appears to be a clear performance difference when invoking the jq library for this effort.simply:more info: official docsIn addition to selecting all elements with an attribute $(\'[someAttribute]\') or $(\'input[someAttribute]\') you can also use a function for doing boolean checks on an object such as in a click handler:if(! this.hasAttribute(\'myattr\') ) { ...I have created npm package with intended behaviour as described above in question.Link to [npm] and [github]Usage is very simple. For example:returns true.Works with camelcase too.JQuery will return the attribute as a string.  Therefore you can check the length of that string to determine if is set:
