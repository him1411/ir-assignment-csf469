I am going to be starting up a new project at work and want to get into unit testing.  We will be using VS 2008, C#, and the ASP.NET MVC stuff.  I am looking at using either NUnit or the built in test projects that VS2008 has, but I am open to researching other suggestions.  Is one system better than the other or perhaps easier to use/understand than the other?  I am looking to get this project set up as kind of the "best practice" for our development efforts going forward.Thanks for any help and suggestions!!Daok named all the pro\'s of VS2008 test projects, here are the pro\'s of NUnit.The unit-testing framework doesn\'t actually matter much, because you can convert test classes with separate project files and conditional compilation \n(like this, VS->NUnit):The TestDriven.Net plugin is nice and not very expensive... With only plain VS2008 you have to find the test from your test class or test list. With TestDriven.Net you can run your test directly from the class that you are testing. After all, unit test should be easy to maintain and near the developer.Benefits/changes of VS2008 Built-in Unit Testing FrameworkI have been using NUnit for 2 years. All is fine but I have to say that the Unit system in  VS is pretty nice because it\'s inside the Gui and can more easily do test for private function without having to mess around. Also, the Unit Testing of VS let you do covering and other stuff that NUnit alone can\'t do.One slight annoyance of Visual Studio\'s testing framework is that it will create many test run files that tend to clutter your project directory - though this isn\'t that big of a deal.Also, if you lack a plugin such as TestDriven.NET, you cannot debug your NUnit (or MbUnit, xUnit, etc.) unit tests within the Visual Studio environment, as you can with the Microsoft VS testing framework, which is built in.Slightly off-topic, but if you go with NUnit I can recommend using ReSharper - it adds some buttons to the VS UI that make it a lot easier to run and debug tests from within the IDE.This review is slightly out-of-date, but explains this in more detail:http://codebetter.com/blogs/paul.laudeman/archive/2006/08/15/Using-ReSharper-as-an-essential-part-of-your-TDD-toolkit.aspxXUnit is another possibility for a greenfield project.  It\'s got perhaps a more intuitive syntax, but is not really compatible with the other frameworks.http://www.codeplex.com/xunitMy main beef with VS unit tests over NUnit is the VS test creation tends to inject a bunch of generated code for private member access.Some might want to test their private methods, some may not, that\'s a different topic.My concern is when I\'m writing unit tests they should be extremely controlled so I know exactly what I\'m testing and exactly how I\'m testing it.  If there\'s auto generated code I\'m losing some of that ownership.I have done some TDD using both and (maybe I\'m a little dumb) nUnit seems to be a lot faster and simpler to use to me. And when I say a lot, I mean a lot.In MS Test, there is too many attributes, everywhere - the code that do the real tests is the tiny lines you may read here and there. A big mess. In nUnit, the code that do the test just dominates the attributes, as it should do.Also, in nUnit, you just have to click on the tests you want to run (only one? all the tests covering a class? an assembly? the solution?). One click. And the window is clear and large. You get clear green and red lights. You really know what happens in one sight.In VSTS, the test list is jammed in the bottom of the screen, it\'s small and ugly. You have to look twice to know what happened. And you cannot run just one test (well, I did not find out yet!).But I may be wrong, of course - I just read about 21 blog posts about "How to do simple TDD using VSTS". I should have read more, you are right.For nUnit, I read one. And I was TDDing the same day. With fun.By the way, I usually love Microsoft products. Visual Studio is really the best tool a developer can buy - but TDD and Work Item management in Visual Studio Team System sucks, really.All the best.\nSylvain.I got messages that "NUnit file structure is richer than VSTest"... \nOf course if you prefer the NUnit file structure, you can use this solution to the other way, like this (NUnit->VS):Or any other conversion... :-) This using here is just alias to compiler.First I want to correct a wrong statement: you can run msTest outside of visual studio using command line. Although several CI tools such as TeamCity have better support for NUnit (probably would change as msTest becomes more popular).\nIn my current project we use both and the only big diffrence we found is that mstest always runs as a 32bit while NUnit runs as either 32bit or 64bit test which only matters if your code uses native code that is 32/64 dependant. I started with MSTest but switched for one simple reason.  MSTest does not support Inheritance of Test Methods from other assemblies.I hated the idea of writing the same test multiple times.  Especially on a large project where test methods can easily run into 100\'s of tests.NUnit does extactly what i need.  The only thing that is missing with NUnit is a Visual Studio Addin which has can display the Red/Green status (Like VSTS) of each test..NET Testing Framework Advice and .NET Unit Testing packages?.If you are considering either MSTest or nUnit, then I recommend you look at mbUnit. My reasons areI originally picked up mbUnit becasue of its [RowTest ....] functionality, and I haven\'t found a single reason to go back. I moved all my active test suites over from nUnit, and never looked back. Since then I\'ve converted two different development teams over to the benefits.As far as I know, there a four frameworks available for unit testing with .NET these daysNUnit has always been out in front but the gap has closed in the last year or so. I still prefer NUnit myself, especially as they added a fluent interface a while back which makes tests very readable.If you\'re just getting started with unit testing it it probably doesn\'t make much difference. Once you\'re up to speed you\'ll be in a better position to judge which framework is best for your needs.I don\'t like VS built-in testing framework because it forces you to create a separate project as opposed to having your tests as part of the project you\'re testing.MSTest is essentially NUnit slightly reworked, with a few new features (such as assembly setup and teardown, not just fixture and test level), and missing some of the best bits (such as the new 2.4 constraint syntax). NUnit is more mature, and there is more support for it from other vendors; and of course since it\'s always been free (whereas MSTest only made it into the Professional version of 2008, before that it was in way more expensive SKUs), most ALT.NET projects use it.Having said that, there are some companies who are incredibly reluctant to use something which does not have the Microsoft label on it, and especially so OSS code. So having an official MS test framework may be the motivation that those companies need to get testing; and let\'s be honest, it\'s the testing that matters, not what tool you use (and using Tuomas Hietanen\'s code above, you can almost make your test framework interchangeable).With the release in .NET 4.0 of the Code Contracts system and the availability of a static checker, you would need to theoretically write fewer test cases and a tool like Pex will help identify those cases.  Relating this to the discussion at hand, if you need to do less with your unit tests because your contracts are covering your tail, then why not just go ahead and use the built-in pieces since that is one less dependency to manage.  These days, I am all about simplicity. :-)See also: I would prefer to use MS\'s little test framework, but for now am sticking with NUnit.  The problems with MS\'s are generally (for me)Caveats\n - If I were testing an aspx site, I would definitely use MS\'s\n - If I were developing solo, also MS would be fine\n - If I had limited skill and couldn\'t configure NUnit :)I find it much easier to just write my tests and fire up NUnitGUI or one of the other front ends (testDriven is far far far far overpriced).  Setting up debugging with the commandline version is also pretty easy.
