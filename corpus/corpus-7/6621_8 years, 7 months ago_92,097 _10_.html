I have a regular C# code. I have no exceptions. I want to programmatically log the current stack trace for debugging purpose. Example:Have a look at the System.Diagnostics namespace.  Lots of goodies in there!This is really good to have a poke around in to learn whats going on under the hood.I\'d recommend that you have a look into logging solutions (Such as NLog, log4net or the Microsoft patterns and practices Enterprise Library) which may achieve your purposes and then some.  Good luck mate!An alternative to System.Diagnostics.StackTrace is to use System.Environment.StackTrace which returns a string-representation of the stacktrace.Another useful option is to use the $CALLER and $CALLSTACK debugging variables in Visual Studio since this can be enabled run-time without rebuilding the application.There are two ways to do this. The System.Diagnostics.StackTrace() will give you a stack trace for the current thread. If you have a reference to a Thread instance, you can get the stack trace for that via the overloaded version of StackTrace(). You may also want to check out Stack Overflow question How to get non-current thread\'s stacktrace?.You can also do this in the Visual Studio debugger without modifying the code.  Of course, this doesn\'t help if you\'re running the code on a different machine, but it can be quite handy to be able to spit out a stack trace automatically without affecting release code or without even needing to restart the program.
