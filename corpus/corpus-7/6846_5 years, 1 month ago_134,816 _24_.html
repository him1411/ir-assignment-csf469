I have a Python pandas DataFrame rpt:I can filter the rows whose stock id is \'600809\' like this: rpt[rpt[\'STK_ID\'] == \'600809\']and I want to get all the rows of some stocks together, such as [\'600809\',\'600141\',\'600329\']. That means I want a syntax like this: Since pandas not accept above command, how to achieve the target? Use the isin method.  rpt[rpt[\'STK_ID\'].isin(stk_list)].isin() is ideal if you have a list of exact matches, but if you have a list of partial matches or substrings to look for, you can filter using the str.contains method and regular expressions.For example, if we want to return a DataFrame where all of the stock IDs which begin with \'600\' and then are followed by any three digits:Suppose now we have a list of strings which we want the values in \'STK_ID\' to end with, e.g.We can join these strings with the regex \'or\' character | and pass the string to str.contains to filter the DataFrame: Finally, contains can ignore case (by setting case=False), allowing you to be more general when specifying the strings you want to match.For example,would match PANDAS, PanDAs, paNdAs123, and so on.you can also use ranges by using:You can also directly query your DataFrame for this information.Or similarly search for ranges:Given a dataframe like this:There are multiple ways of selecting or slicing the data.The most obvious is the .isin feature. You can create a mask that gives you a series of True/False statements, which can be applied to a dataframe like this:Masking is the ad-hoc solution to the problem, but does not always perform well in terms of speed and memory.By setting the index to the STK_ID column, we can use the pandas builtin slicing object .locThis is the fast way of doing it, even if the indexing can take a little while, it saves time if you want to do multiple queries like this.This can also be done by merging dataframes. This would fit more for a scenario where you have a lot more data than in these examples.All the above methods work even if there are multiple rows with the same \'STK_ID\'You can use query, i.e.:
