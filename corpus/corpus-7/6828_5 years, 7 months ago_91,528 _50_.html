I am new to asynchronous programming with the async modifier. I am trying to figure out how to make sure that my Main method of a console application actually runs asynchronously.I know this is not running asynchronously from "the top." Since it is not possible to specify the async modifier on the Main method, how can I run code within main asynchronously?As you discovered, in VS11 the compiler will disallow an async Main method. This was allowed (but never recommended) in VS2010 with the Async CTP.I have recent blog posts about async/await and asynchronous console programs in particular. Here\'s some background info from the intro post:If "await" sees that the awaitable has not completed, then it acts asynchronously. It tells the awaitable to run the remainder of the method when it completes, and then returns from the async method. Await will also capture the current context when it passes the remainder of the method to the awaitable.Later on, when the awaitable completes, it will execute the remainder of the async method (within the captured context).Here\'s why this is a problem in Console programs with an async Main:Remember from our intro post that an async method will return to its caller before it is complete. This works perfectly in UI applications (the method just returns to the UI event loop) and ASP.NET applications (the method returns off the thread but keeps the request alive). It doesn\'t work out so well for Console programs: Main returns to the OS - so your program exits.One solution is to provide your own context - a "main loop" for your console program that is async-compatible.If you have a machine with the Async CTP, you can use GeneralThreadAffineContext from My Documents\\Microsoft Visual Studio Async CTP\\Samples(C# Testing) Unit Testing\\AsyncTestUtilities. Alternatively, you can use AsyncContext from my Nito.AsyncEx NuGet package.Here\'s an example using AsyncContext; GeneralThreadAffineContext has almost identical usage:Alternatively, you can just block the main Console thread until your asynchronous work has completed:Note the use of GetAwaiter().GetResult(); this avoids the AggregateException wrapping that happens if you use Wait() or Result.You can solve this with this simple construct:That will put everything you do out on the ThreadPool where you\'d want it (so other Tasks you start/await don\'t attempt to rejoin a Thread they shouldn\'t), and wait until everything\'s done before closing the Console app. No need for special loops or outside libs.Edit: Incorporate Andrew\'s solution for uncaught Exceptions.You can do this without needing external libraries also by doing the following:I\'ll add an important feature that all of the other answers have overlooked: cancellation.One of the big things in TPL is cancellation support, and console apps have a method of cancellation built in (CTRL+C). It\'s very simple to bind them together. This is how I structure all of my async console apps:Haven\'t needed this much yet, but when I\'ve used console application for Quick tests and required async I\'ve just solved it like this:The final code looks like:For asynchronously calling task from Main, use Task.Run() for .NET 4.5 Task.Factory.StartNew() for .NET 4.0   (May require Microsoft.Bcl.Async library for async and await keywords)Details:\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2011/10/24/10229468.aspxIn C# 7.1 you will be able to do a proper async Main. The appropriate signatures for Main method has been extended to:For e.g. you could be doing:At compile time, the async entry point method will be translated to call GetAwaitor().GetResult().Details: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mazhou/2017/05/30/c-7-series-part-2-async-mainIn Main try changing the call to GetList to:When the C# 5 CTP was introduced, you certainly could mark Main with async... although it was generally not a good idea to do so. I believe this was changed by the release of VS 2013 to become an error.Unless you\'ve started any other foreground threads, your program will exit when Main completes, even if it\'s started some background work.What are you really trying to do? Note that your GetList() method really doesn\'t need to be async at the moment - it\'s adding an extra layer for no real reason. It\'s logically equivalent to (but more complicated than):On MSDN, the documentation for Task.Run Method (Action) provides this example which shows how to run a method asynchronously from main:Note this statement that follows the example:The examples show that the asynchronous task executes on a different\n  thread than the main application thread.So, if instead you want the task to run on the main application thread, see the answer by @StephenCleary.And regarding the thread on which the task runs, also note Stephen\'s comment on his answer:You can use a simple Wait or Result, and there\'s nothing wrong\n  with that. But be aware that there are two important differences: 1)\n  all async continuations run on the thread pool rather than the main\n  thread, and 2) any exceptions are wrapped in an AggregateException.(See Exception Handling (Task Parallel Library) for how to incorporate exception handling to deal with an AggregateException.)Finally, on MSDN from the documentation for Task.Delay Method (TimeSpan), this example shows how to run an asynchronous task that returns a value:Note that instead of passing a delegate to Task.Run, you can instead pass a lambda function like this:To avoid freezing when you call a function somewhere down the call stack that tries to re-join the current thread (which is stuck in a Wait), you need to do the following:(the cast is only required to resolve ambiguity)In my case I had a list of jobs that I wanted to run in async from my main method, have been using this in production for quite sometime and works fine.Newest version of C# - C# 7.1 allows to create async console app. To enable C# 7.1 in project, you have to upgrade your VS to at least 15.3, and change C# version to C# 7.1 or C# latest minor version. To do this, go to Project properties -> Build -> Advanced -> Language version.After this, following code will work:C# 7.1 (using vs 2017 update 3) introduces async mainYou can write:for more details C# 7 Series, Part 2: Async Main
