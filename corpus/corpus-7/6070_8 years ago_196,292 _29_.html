In jQuery, $("...").get(3) returns the 3rd DOM element. What is the function to return the 3rd jQuery element?Why not browse the (short) selectors page first?Here it is: the :eq() operator. It is used just like get(), but it returns the jQuery object.Or you can use .eq() function too.You can use the :eq selector, for example:Or the Traversing/eq function:Also, remember that the indexes are zero-based.if you have control over the query which builds the jQuery object, use :eq()If you don\'t have control over it (for example, it\'s being passed from another function or something), then use .eq()Or if you want a section of them (say, the third, fourth and fifth elements), use .slice()I think you can use this It finds the second li in each matched ul and notes it..eq() -An integer indicating the 0-based position of the element. Ex:Consider a page with a simple list on it:We can apply this method to the set of list items:\nFor more information :  .eq()If I understand your question correctly, you can always just wrap the get function like so:If you already have the jquery object in a variable, you can also just treat it as a normal indexed array, without the use of jquery:Although the above example is not useful in any way, it is representing how you can treat objects created by jquery as indexed arrays.For iterations using a selector doesn\'t seem to make any sense though:When it runs, there are two items in the ordered list that show, First, and Third.  The second was hidden.If you want to fetch particular element/node or tag in loop for e.g.So, from above code loop is executed and we want particular field to select for that we have to use jQuery selection that can select only expecting element from above loop so, code will bee.g.as well as by other methodbut first method is more efficient when HTML <tag> has unique class name.NOTE:Second method is use when their is no class name in target element or node.for more follow https://api.jquery.com/eq/
