I\'ve got a string that has data-123 as its value. How in jQuery or Javascript would I go in and remove the data- from the string while leaving the 123?No jQuery needed.Docs.For all occurrences to be discarded use:PS: Do not forget that the replace is done in place, so you may want to assign the new string in a variable.This doesn\'t have anything to do with jQuery. You can use the JavaScript replace function for this:You can also pass a regex to this function. In the following example, it would replace everything except numerics:You can use "data-123".replace(\'data-\',\'\');, as mentioned, but as replace() only replaces the FIRST instance of the matching text, if your string was something like "data-123data-" thenwill only replace the first matching text. And your output will be "123data-"DEMOSo if you want all matches of text to be replaced in string you have to use a regular expression with the g flag like that:And your output will be "123"DEMO2you can use slice() it returens charcters between start to end (included end point)here is some exmp to show how it works:  DemoPlain old JavaScript will suffice - jQuery is not necessary for such a simple task:See: .replace() docs on MDN for additional information and usage.Ex:-Hopefully this will work for you.I was used to the C# (Sharp) String.Remove method.\nIn Javascript, there is no remove function for string, but there is substr function.\nYou can use the substr function once or twice to remove characters from string.\nYou can make the following function to remove characters at start index to the end of string, just like the c# method first overload String.Remove(int startIndex):and/or you also can make the following function to remove characters at start index and count, just like the c# method second overload String.Remove(int startIndex, int count):and then you can use these two functions or one of them for your needs!Example:Output: 123Using match() and Number() to return a number variable:Here\'s what the statement above does...working middle-out:This little function I made has always worked for me :)I know it is not the best, but It has always worked for me :)
