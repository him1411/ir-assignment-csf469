Since ANSI C99 there is _Bool or bool via stdbool.h. But is there also a printf format specifier for bool?I mean something like in that pseudo code:which would print:There isn\'t. But since any integral type shorter than int is promoted to int when passed down to printf()s variadic arguments, you can use %d:But why notor betteror even betterinstead?There is no format specifier for bool. You can print it using some of the existing specifiers for printing integral types or do something more fancy:ANSI C99/C11 don\'t include an extra printf conversion specifier for bool.But the GNU C library provides an API for adding custom specifiers.An example:Since it is a glibc extensions the GCC warns about that custom specifier:Output:In the tradition of itoa():You can\'t, but you can print 0 or 1sourceIf you like C++ better than C, you can try this:I prefer an answer from Best way to print the result of a bool as 'false' or 'true' in c?, just likeTo just print 1 or 0 based on the boolean value I just used:Especially useful with Flags:
