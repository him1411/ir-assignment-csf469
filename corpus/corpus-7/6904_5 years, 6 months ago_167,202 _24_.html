I have the following code:I know Thing does nothing, but my Hello, World program compiles just fine without it. It\'s only my defined classes that are failing on me.And it refuses to compile. I get No enclosing instance of type Hello is accessible." at the line that creates a new Thing. I\'m guessing either:Any ideas?static class Thing will make your program work.As it is, you\'ve got Thing as an inner class, which (by definition) is associated with a particular instance of Hello (even if it never uses or refers to it), which means it\'s an error to say new Thing(); without having a particular Hello instance in scope. If you declare it as a static class instead, then it\'s a "nested" class, which doesn\'t need a particular Hello instance.You\'ve declared the class Thing as a non-static inner class. That means it must be associated with an instance of the Hello class.In your code, you\'re trying to create an instance of Thing from a static context. That is what the compiler is complaining about.There are a few possible solutions. Which solution to use depends on what you want to achieve.Change Thing to be a static nested class.Create an instance of Hello, then create an instance of Thing.Move Thing out of the Hello class.For more information on nested/inner classes:\nNested Classes (The Java Tutorials)Well... so many good answers but i wanna to add more on it. A brief look on Inner class in Java- Java allows us to define a class within another class and\nBeing able to nest classes in this way has certain advantages:It can hide(It increases encapsulation) the class from other classes - especially relevant if the class is only being used by the class it is contained within. In this case there is no need for the outside world to know about it.It can make code more maintainable as the classes are logically grouped together around where they are needed.The inner class has access to the instance variables and methods of its containing class.We have mainly three types of  Inner Classes Some of the important points to be rememberLet`s try to see the above concepts practically_I hope this will helps to everyone. Please  refer for moreThing is an inner class with an automatic connection to an instance of Hello. You get a compile error because there is no instance of Hello for it to attach to. You can fix it most easily by changing it to a static nested class which has no connection:Lets understand it with the following simple example. \nThis happens because this is NON-STATIC INNER CLASS. You should need the instance of outer class.
