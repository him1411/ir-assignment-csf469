In my Objective-C projects I often use a global constants file to store things like notification names and keys for NSUserDefaults. It looks something like this:How do I do exactly the same thing in Swift?IMO the best way to deal with that type of constants is to create a Struct.Then, for example,  call it like this in your code:Edit: If you want a better organization I advise you to use segmented sub structsThen you can just use for instance K.Path.Tmp I am abit late to the party.No matter here\'s how i manage the constants file so that it makes more sense to developers while writing code in swift.FOR URL:For CUSTOMFONTS:FOR ALL THE KEYS USED IN APPFOR COLOR CONSTANTS:You can wrap these all files in a common group named Constants in your Xcode Project.And for more watch this videoAlthough I prefer @Francescu\'s way (using a struct with static properties), you can also define global constants and variables:Note however that differently from local variables/constants and class/struct properties, globals are implicitly lazy, which means they are initialized when they are accessed for the first time.Suggested reading: Global and Local Variables, and also Global variables in Swift are not variablesConstant.swiftViewController.swiftOr just in GlobalConstants.swift:Consider enumerations. These can be logically broken up for separate use cases.One unique benefit happens when you have a situation of mutually exclusive options, such as:In this example, you will receive a compile error because you have not handled the case of PhotoMetaKeys.DateTaken.Like others have mention anything declared outside a class is global.You can also create singletons:Any time you want to use something from this class you e.g. write:If you now write println(TestClass.sharedInstance.number) from anywhere in your project you will print 1 to the log. This works for all kinds of Objects.tl;dr: Any time you want to make everything in a class global, add static let sharedInstance = YourClassName() to the class, and address all values of the class with the prefix YourClassName.sharedInstanceColorsFontsFor other - everything the same as in accepted answer.What I did in my Swift project\n1: Create new Swift File\n2: Create a struct and static constant in it.\n3: For Using just use YourStructName.baseURLNote: After Creating initialisation takes little time so it will show in other viewcontrollers after 2-5 seconds.For notifications you can use extension, something like this:And use it like NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .testNotification, object: nil)
