I see this error only after upgrading my PHP environment to PHP 5.4 and beyond. The error points to this line of code:Error:Creating default object from empty valueCode:Do I first need to declare my $res object?Your new environment may have E_STRICT warnings enabled in error_reporting if it is  PHP <= 5.3, or if simply have error_reporting set to at least E_WARNING with PHP 5.4+. . That error is triggered when $res is NULL or not yet initialized:PHP will report a different error message if $res is already initialized to some value but is not an object:In order to comply with E_STRICT standards prior to PHP 5.4, or the normal E_WARNING error level in PHP >= 5.4, assuming you are trying to create a generic object and assign the property success, you need to declare $res as an object of stdClass in the global namespace:This message has been E_STRICT for PHP <= 5.3. Since PHP 5.4, it was unluckilly changed to E_WARNING. Since E_WARNING messages are useful, you don\'t want to disable them completely.To get rid of this warning, you must use this code:This is fully equivalent replacement. It assures exactly the same thing which PHP is silently doing - unfortunatelly with warning now - implicit object creation. You should always check if the object already exists, unless you are absolutely sure that it doesn\'t. The code provided by Michael is no good in general, because in some contexts the object might sometimes be already defined at the same place in code, depending on circumstances.Simply,orandTry this:A simple way to get this error is to type (a) below, meaning to type (b)(a) $this->my->variable(b) $this->my_variableTrivial, but very easily overlooked and hard to spot if you are not looking for it.Try this if you have array and add objects to it.This sends ARRAY of Objects for later use~!This problem is caused because your are assigning to an instance of object which is not initiated. For eg:Your case:Solution:If you put "@" character begin of the line then PHP doesn\'t show any warning/notice for this line. For example:For preventing this warning for this line you must put "@" character begin of the line like this:I\'m using this trick when developing. I don\'t like disable all warning messages becouse if you don\'t handle warnings correctly then they will become a big error in future.no you do not .. it will create it when you add the success value to the object.the default class is inherited if you do not specify one.I put the following at the top of the faulting PHP file and the error was no longer display:
