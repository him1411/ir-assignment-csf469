I frequently see code which involves iterating over the result of a database query, doing something with each row, and then moving on to the next row. Typical examples are as follows. These all seem excessively long-winded to me, each with multiple calls to Cursor methods. Surely there must be a neater way?The simplest way is this:The cursor starts before the first result row, so on the first iteration this moves to the first result if it exists. If the cursor is empty, or the last row has already been processed, then the loop exits neatly.Of course, don\'t forget to close the cursor once you\'re done with it, preferably in a finally clause. If you target API 19+, you can use try-with-resources.The best looking way I\'ve found to go through a cursor is the following:Don\'t forget to close the cursor afterwardsEDIT: The given solution is great if you ever need to iterate a cursor that you are not responsible for. A good example would be, if you are taking a cursor as argument in a method, and you need to scan the cursor for a given value, without having to worry for the cursor\'s current position.I\'d just like to point out a third alternative which also works if the cursor is not at the start position:How about using foreach loop:However my version of CursorUtils should be less ugly, but it automatically closes the cursor:Below could be the better way:The above code would insure that it would go through entire iteration and won\'t escape first and last iteration.The Do/While solution is more elegant, but if you do use just the While solution posted above, without the moveToPosition(-1) you will miss the first element (at least on the Contact query).I suggest: Example code:Initially  cursor is not on the first row show using moveToNext() you can iterate the cursor when record is not exist then it return false,unless it return true,
