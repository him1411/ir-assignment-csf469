I need to check if the thread running a certain piece of code is the main (UI) thread or not. How can I achieve this?if this returns true, then you\'re on the UI thread!you can use below code  to know if current thread is UI/Main thread or notor you can also use this Here is similar questionThe best way is the clearest way: *Or, if the runtime platform is API level 23 (Marshmallow 6.0) or higher:See the Looper API.  Note that calling Looper.getMainLooper() involves synchonization (see the source).  You might want to avoid the overhead by storing the return value and reusing it.   * credit greg7gkbSummarizing the solutions, I think that\'s the best one:And, if you wish to run something on the UI thread, you can use this:you can verify it in android ddms logcat where process id will be same but thread id will be different.You can try Thread.currentThread().isDaemon()
