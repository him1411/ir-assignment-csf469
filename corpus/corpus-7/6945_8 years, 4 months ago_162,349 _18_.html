This question already has an answer here:Why do I receive a syntax error when printing a string in Python 3?In Python 3, print became a function. This means that you need to include parenthesis now like mentioned below:It looks like you\'re using Python 3.0, in which print has turned into a callable function rather than a statement.Because in Python 3, print statement has been replaced with a print() function, with keyword arguments to replace most of the special syntax of the old print statement. So you have to write it as But if you write this in a programme and some one using Python 2.x tries to run, they will get an error. To avoid this, it is a good practice to import print functionNow you code works on both 2.x & 3.xCheck out below examples also to get familiar with print() function.Source: What\xe2\x80\x99s New In Python 3.0?In Python 3.0, print is a regular function that requires ():In Python 3, it\'s print("something") , not print "something".It looks like you\'re using Python 3. In Python 3, print has been changed to a method instead of a statement. Try this:In Python 3, you must do print(\'some code\'). This is because in Python 3 it has become a function. If you must, you can use your Python 2 code and convert it to Python 3 code using 2to3 - it is a great built-in program which comes with Python. For more, see Python 2to3 - Convert your Python 2 to Python 3 automatically!.You have to use bracket with print print("Hello World")In Python 2.X print is a keyword as you can see in this link. However, in Python 3.X print becomes a function, so the correct way to do it is print(something).\nYou can get the list of keywords for each version by executing the following:2to3 is a Python program that reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into valid Python 3.x codeFurther informations can be found here: Python Documentation: Automated Python 2 to 3 code translation
