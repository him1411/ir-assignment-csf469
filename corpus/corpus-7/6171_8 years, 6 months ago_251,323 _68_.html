Edit - Original Title: Is there an alternative way to achieve border-collapse:collapse in CSS (in order to have a collapsed, rounded corner table)?Since it turns out that simply getting the table\'s borders to collapse does not solve the root problem, I have updated the title to better reflect the discussion.I am trying to make a table with rounded corners using the CSS3 border-radius property. The table styles I\'m using look something like this:Here\'s the problem. I also want to set the border-collapse:collapse property, and when that is set border-radius no longer works. Is there a CSS-based way I can get the same effect as border-collapse:collapse without actually using it?Edits:I\'ve made a simple page to demonstrate the problem here (Firefox/Safari only).It seems that a large part of the problem is that setting the table to have rounded corners does not affect the corners of the corner td elements. If the table was all one color, this wouldn\'t be a problem since I could just make the top and bottom td corners rounded for the first and last row respectively. However, I am using different background colors for the table to differentiate the headings and for striping, so the inner td elements would show their rounded corners as well.Summary of proposed solutions:Surrounding the table with another element with round corners doesn\'t work because the table\'s square corners "bleed through."Specifying border width to 0 doesn\'t collapse the table.Bottom td corners still square after setting cellspacing to zero.Using JavaScript instead- works by avoiding the problem.Possible solutions:The tables are generated in PHP, so I could just apply a different class to each of the outer th/tds and style each corner separately. I\'d rather not do this, since it\'s not very elegant and a bit of a pain to apply to multiple tables, so please keep suggestions coming.Possible solution 2 is to use JavaScript (jQuery, specifically) to style the corners. This solution also works, but still not quite what I\'m looking for (I know I\'m picky). I have two reservations: I know that trying to do this with CSS3 today may seem needless, but I have my reasons. I would also like to point out that this problem is a result of the w3c specification, not poor CSS3 support, so any solution will still be relevant and useful when CSS3 has more widespread support.I figured it out. You just have to use some special selectors.The problem with rounding the corners of the table was that the td elements didn\'t also become rounded. You can solve that by doing something like this:Now everything rounds properly, except that there\'s still the issue of border-collapse: collapse breaking everything. A workaround is to set cellspacing="0" in the html instead (thanks, Joel).The following method works (tested in Chrome) by using a box-shadow with a spread of 1px instead of a "real" border.If you want a CSS-only solution (no need to set cellspacing=0 in the HTML) that allows for 1px borders (which you can\'t do with the border-spacing: 0 solution), I prefer to do the following:See a demo here.Given the following HTML:SEE example below:\nHave you tried using table{border-spacing: 0} instead of table{border-collapse: collapse} ???You\'ll probably have to put another element around the table and style that with a rounded border.The working draft specifies that border-radius does not apply to table elements when the value of border-collapse is collapse.As Ian said, the solution is to nest the table inside a div and set it like that:With overflow:hidden, the square corners won\'t bleed through the div.To the best of my knowledge, the only way you could do it would be to modify all the cells like so:And then to get the border on the bottom and right back:last-child is not valid in ie6, but if you are using border-radius I assume you don\'t care.EDIT:After looking at your example page, it appears that you may be able to work around this with cell spacing and padding.  The thick gray borders you are seeing are actually the background of the table (you can see this clearly if you change the border color to red). If you set the cellspacing to zero (or equivalently: td, th { margin:0; }) the grey "borders" will disappear.EDIT 2:I can\'t find a way to do this with only one table. If you change your header row to a nested table, you might possibly be able to get the effect you want, but it\'ll be more work, and not dynamic.I tried a workaround using the pseudo elements :before and :after on the thead th:first-child and thead th:last-childIn combination with wrapping the table with a <div class="radius borderCCC">see jsFiddleWorks for me in chrome (13.0.782.215) Let me know if this works for you in other browsers.For a bordered and scrollable table, use this (replace variables, $ starting texts)If you use thead, tfoot or th, just replace tr:first-child and tr-last-child and td with them.HTML:I had the same problem.\nremove border-collapse entirely and use: \ncellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"\nin the html document.\nexample:The given answers only work when there are no borders around the table, which is very limiting!I have a macro in SASS to do this, which fully supports external and internal borders, achieving the same styling as border-collapse: collapse without actually specifying it.  Tested in FF/IE8/Safari/Chrome.Gives nice rounded borders in pure CSS in all browsers but IE8 (degrades gracefully) since IE8 doesn\'t support border-radius :(Some older browsers may require vendor prefixes to work with border-radius, so feel free to add those prefixes to your code as necessary.This answer is not the shortest - but it works.To apply this style simply change yourtag to the following:and be sure to include the above CSS styles in your HTML.Hope this helps.I just wrote a crazy set of CSS for this that seems to work perfectly:Solution with border-collapse:separate for table and display:inline-table for tbody and  thead.I am new with HTML and CSS and I was also looking for solution for this, here what I find.I try it, guess what it works :)Found this answer after running into the same problem, but found it\'s pretty simple: just give the table overflow:hiddenNo need for a wrapping element. Granted, I don\'t know if this would have worked 7 years ago when the question was initially asked, but it works now.I started experiment with "display" and I found that: border-radius, border, margin, padding, in a table are displayed with:For example But we need set a width of every column Here is a recent example of how to implement a table with rounded-corners from http://medialoot.com/preview/css-ui-kit/demo.html.  It\'s based on the special selectors suggested by Joel Potter above.  As you can see, it also includes some magic to make IE a little happy.  It includes some extra styles to alternate the color of the rows:I always do this way using Sass.Border-radius is now officially supported.  So, in all of the above examples you may drop the "-moz-" prefix.Another trick is to use the same color for the top and bottom rows as is your border. With all 3 colors the same, it blends in and looks like a perfectly rounded table even though it isn\'t physically.
