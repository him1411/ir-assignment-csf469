I have design problem with Google Chrome and its form autofill function.\nIf Chrome remembers some login/password it changes a background color to a yellow one.Here are some screenshots:\nHow to remove that background or just disable this autofill ?Change "white" to any color you want.Solution here:If you guys want transparent input fields you can use transition and transition delay. In Firefox you can disable all autocomplete on a form by using the autocomplete="off/on" attribute.  Likewise individual items autocomplete can be set using the same attribute.You can test this in Chrome as it should work.If you want to preserve the autofill, as well as any data, attached handlers and functionality attached to your input elements, try this script:It polls until it finds any autofill elements, clones them including data and events, then inserts them into the DOM in the same location and removes the original. It stops polling once it finds any to clone since the autofill sometimes takes a second after page load. This is a variation of a previous code sample, but more robust and keeps as much functionality intact as possible.(Confirmed working in Chrome, Firefox and IE 8.)The following CSS removes the yellow background color and replaces it with a background color of your choosing.  It doesn\'t disable auto-fill and it requires no jQuery or Javascript hacks.Solution copied from:\nOverride browser form-filling and input highlighting with HTML/CSSWorked for me, only the css change required.you can put any color in place of #ffffff.This fixes the problem on both Safari and ChromeA little bit hacky but works perfectly for meHere\'s the MooTools version of Jason\'s. Fixes it in Safari too.This helped me, a CSS only version.input:-webkit-autofill {\n    -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 0px 1000px white inset;\n}where white can be any color you want.I use this,A combination of answers worked for me In your  tag, simply insert this small line of code. However, do not place this in the username/email/idname field because if you are still looking to use autocomplete, it will disable it for this field. But I found a way around this, simply place the code in your password input tag because you never autocomplete passwords anyways. This fix should remove the color force, matinain autocomplete ability on your email/username field, and allows you to avoid bulky hacks like Jquery or javascript.If you want to get rid of it entirely, I\'ve adjusted the code in the previous answers so it works on hover, active and focus too:Here\'s a Mootools solution doing the same as Alessandro\'s - replaces each affected input with a new one.What about that solution:It turns off the auto-complete and auto-fill (so yellow backgrounds disappear), waits 100 milliseconds an then turns the auto-complete functionality back without auto-fill.If you have inputs that need to be auto-filled, then give them auto-complete-on css class.None of the solutions worked for me, the username and password inputs were still being populated and given the yellow background.So I asked myself, "How does Chrome determine what should be autofilled on a given page?""Does it look for input ids, input names? Form ids? Form action?"Through my experimentation with the username and the password inputs, there were only two ways I found that would cause Chrome to not be able to find the fields that should be autofilled:1) Put the password input ahead of the text input.\n2) Give them the same name and id ... or no name and id.After the page loads, with javascript you can either change the order of the inputs on the page, or dynamically give them their name and id ...And Chrome doesn\'t know what hit it ... autocomplete stays off.Crazy hack, I know. But it\'s working for me.Chrome 34.0.1847.116, OSX 10.7.5The only way that works for me was:(jQuery required)I fixed this issue for a password field i have like this:Set the input type to text instead of passwordRemove the input text value with jQueryConvert the input type to password with jQueryAn update to Arjans solution. When trying to change the values it wouldnt let you. This works fine for me. When you focus on an input then it will go yellow. its close enough.Try this code:fareed namrouti answer is correct. But the background still get yellow when the input is selected. Adding !important fix the problem. If you want also textarea and select with the same behavior just add textarea:-webkit-autofill, select:-webkit-autofillOnly inputinput, select, textareaAdding autocomplete="off" is not gonna cut it.Change input type attribute to type="search".\nGoogle doesn\'t apply auto-fill to inputs with a type of search.Hope this saves you some time.The final solution:Similar Question: LinkHi use this code.Just found myself with the same question.  This works for me:
