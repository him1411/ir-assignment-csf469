Is there a typedef equivalent in C#, or someway to get some sort of similar behaviour? I\'ve done some googling, but everywhere I look seems to be negative. Currently I have a situation similar to the following:Now, it doesn\'t take a rocket scientist to figure out that this can very quickly lead to a lot of typing (apologies for the horrible pun) when trying to implement a handler for that event. It\'d end up being something like this:Except, in my case, I was already using a complex type, not just an int. It\'d be nice if it were possible to simplify this a little...Edit: ie. perhaps typedefing the EventHandler instead of needing to redefine it to get similar behaviour.No, there\'s no true equivalent of typedef. You can use \'using\' directives within one file, e.g.but that will only impact that source file. In C and C++, my experience is that typedef is usually used within .h files which are included widely - so a single typedef can be used over a whole project. That ability does not exist in C#, because there\'s no #include functionality in C# that would allow you to include the using directives from one file in another.Fortunately, the example you give does have a fix - implicit method group conversion. You can change your event subscription line to just::)Jon really gave a nice solution, I didn\'t know you could do that!At times what I resorted to was inheriting from the class and creating its constructors. E.g.Not the best solution (unless your assembly gets used by other people), but it works.If you know what you\'re doing, you can define a class with implicit operators to convert between the alias class and the actual class.I don\'t actually endorse this and haven\'t ever used something like this, but this could probably work for some specific circumstances.I think there is no typedef. You could only define a specific delegate type instead of the generic one in the GenericClass, i.e.This would make it shorter. But what about the following suggestion:Use Visual Studio. This way, when you typedit already provides the complete event handler signature from Intellisense. Press TAB and it\'s there. Accept the generated handler name or change it, and then press TAB again to auto-generate the handler stub.C# supports some inherited covariance for event delegates, so a method like this:Can be used to subscribe to your event, no explicit cast required You can even use lambda syntax and the intellisense will all be done for you:You can use an open source library and NuGet package called LikeType that I created that will give you the GenericClass<int> behavior that you\'re looking for.The code would look like:Here is the code for it, enjoy!, I picked that up from the dotNetReference\ntype the "using" statement inside the namespace line 106\nhttp://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/microsoft/win32/win32native.cs
