I have installed PostgreSQL 8.4, Postgres client and Pgadmin 3. Authentication failed for user "postgres" for both console client and Pgadmin. I have typed user as "postgres" and password "postgres", because it worked before. But now authentication is failed. I did it before a couple of times without this problem. What should I do? And what happens?If I remember correctly the user postgres has no DB password set on Ubuntu by default. That means, that you can login to that account only by using the postgres OS user account.Assuming, that you have root access on the box you can do:If that fails with a database "postgres" does not exists error, then you are most likely not on a Ubuntu or Debian server :-) In this case simply add template1 to the command:If any of those commands fail with an error psql: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "postgres" then check the file /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf: There must be a line like this as the first non-comment line:For newer versions of PostgreSQL ident actually might be peer. That\'s OK also.Inside the psql shell you can give the DB user postgres a password: You can leave the psql shell by typing CtrlD or with the command \\q.Now you should be able to give pgAdmin a valid password for the DB superuser and it will be happy too. :-)The response of staff is correct, but if you want to further automate can do:$ sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD \'postgres\';"Done! You saved User = postgres and password = postgres.If you do not have a password for the User postgres ubuntu do:$ sudo passwd postgresThis was frustrating, most of the above answers are correct but they fail to mention you have to restart the database service before the changes in the pg_hba.conf file will take affect.so if you do something like the above  local   all         postgres                          identthen restart as root ( on centos its something like service service postgresql-9.2 restart )\nnow you should be able to access the db as the user postgres$psql\npsql (9.2.4)\nType "help" for help.postgres=# Hope this adds info for new postgres usersIf you are trying to login postgres shell as postgres user, then you can use following commands.switch to postgres userlogin to psqlHope that helpsEdit the pg_hba.conf file, e.g. with sudo emacs /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.confChange all authentication methods to trust. Change Unix Password for "postgres" user. Restart Server. Login with psql -h localhost -U postgres and use the just set Unix password. If it works you can re-set the pg_hba.conf file to the default values.Try to not use the -W parameter and leave the password in blank. Sometimes the user is created with no-password.If that doesn\'t work reset the password. There are several ways to do it, but this works on many systems:As a rule of thumb: YOU SHOULD NEVER EVER SET A PASSWORD FOR THE POSTGRES USER.If you need a superuser access from pgAdmin, make another superuser. That way, if the credentials for that superuser is compromised, you can always ssh into the actual database host and manually delete the superuser using I just wanted to add that you should also check if your password is expired.See Postgres password authentication fails for details.Here are some combinations which I tried to login:
