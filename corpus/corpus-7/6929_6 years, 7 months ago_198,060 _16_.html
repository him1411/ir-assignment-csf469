This seems simple, I am trying to set a bitmap image but from the resources, I have within the application in the drawable folder.Is this correct?  Assuming you are calling this in an Activity classThe first parameter, Resources, is required. It is normally obtainable in any Context (and subclasses like Activity). Try this This is from sdcardThis is from resourcesIf the resource is showing and is a view, you can also capture it. Like a screenshot:This actually grabs the whole layout but you can alter as you wish.If you have declare a bitmap object and you want to display it or store this bitmap object. but first you have to assign any image , and you may use the button click event, this code will only demonstrate that how to store the drawable image in bitmap Object.Now you can use this bitmap object, whether you want to store it, or to use it in google maps while drawing a pic on fixed latitude and longitude, or to use some where elseI found this question when I wanted to set a bitmap to my View. For that reason, I found this code more helpful:       From here just replace this line withI mean to say just change null value with getResources() If you use this code in any button or Image view click event just append getApplicationContext() before getResources()..
