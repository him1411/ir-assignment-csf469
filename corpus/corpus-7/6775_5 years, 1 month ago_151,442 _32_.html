Let\'s say I had a text file with the following nine lines:How can I use Sublime Text 2 to remove all four of the blank/empty lines, leaving only five lines?Select the textPress:Make sure you have selected \'regular expression\' by pressing:Find what: ^\\nReplace With: (nothing, leave in blank).The regexp in Hugo\'s answer is correct when there is no spaces in the line. In case if there are space regexp can be ^\\s+$There are also some ST2/ST3 Plugins for such tasks. I do like these two:The first one has two methods for removing empty/unnecessary lines. One of them called Delete Surplus Blank Lines which is cool. It removes only those lines that are followed by another empty lineI had to use:replace \\n^\\s*\\n\nwith    \\nThe https://github.com/NicholasBuse/sublime_DeleteBlankLines plugin did nothing at all.A Find/Replace solution:Regex Find:\\s+Replace with:  //single spaceDon\'t even know how this whole thing works, but I tried \n^\\s*$ and didn\'t work (leaving still some empty lines).This instead ^\\s* works for me \n\n{sublime text 3}Simpler than I thought. Ctrl + A Followed by Ctrl + H Then Select Regular Expression .* . Replace \\n\\n with \\n. Voila!You are looking for this:it will not delete the line, if there is content with white space or tabs in front>e.g.:these will not be deleted:\n...space... abc...tab... abcthis will:...space...  ...nothing else......tab... ...nothing else...Using multiple selections: select one pair of line breaks, then use Quick Find All (Alt+F3), or Quick Add Next (Ctrl+D) repeatedly, to select them all; then hit Enter to replace them with single line breaks.There\'s also "Join lines". If on OSX, select all your text, and press CMD-J a few times, and it will collapse your selection by line, removing the line breaks. Edit: This approach will leave you with everything on one line, which is not what you asked for. For those who are curious of sublime text editor, the unofficial-documentation may be interesting!If   ^\\n does not work properly   ===>   try   .*[^\\w]\\n
