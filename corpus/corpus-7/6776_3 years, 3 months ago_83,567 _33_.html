Is it possible in Swift? If not then is there a workaround to do it?If you want to use optional methods, you must mark your protocol with @objc attribute:Otherwise, Swift protocols behave like interfaces on other OO languages, where all methods defined in interfaces must be implemented.In Swift 2.0 it\'s possible to add default implementations of a protocol. This creates a new way of optional methods in protocols. It\'s not a really nice way in creating optional protocol methods, but gives you the possibility to use structs in in protocol callbacks.I wrote a small summary here:\nhttp://www.avanderlee.com/swift-2-0/optional-protocol-methods/The other answers here involving marking the protocol as "@objc" do not work when using swift-specific types. In order to declare optional protocols that work well with swift, declare the functions as variables instead of func\'s. And then implement the protocol as followsYou can then use "?" to check whether or not the function has been implementedIn Swift 3.0It will save your time.Here is a concrete example with the delegation pattern.Setup your Protocol:Set the delegate to a class and implement the Protocol. See that the optional method does not need to be implemented.One important thing is that the optional method is optional and needs a "?" when calling. Mention the second question mark.Since there are some answers about how to use optional modifier and @objc attribute to define optional requirement protocol, I will give a sample about how to use protocol extensions define optional protocol.Below code is Swift 3.*.Please notice protocol extension methods can\'t invoked by Objective-C code, and worse is Swift team won\'t fix it. https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-492Slightly off topic from the original question, but it builds off Antoine\xe2\x80\x99s idea and I thought it might help someone. You can also make computed properties optional for structs with protocol extensions.You can make a property on the protocol optionalImplement the dummy computed property in the protocol extensionAnd now you can use structs that do or don\xe2\x80\x99t have the optional property implementedI\xe2\x80\x99ve also written up how to do optional properties in Swift protocols on my blog, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep updated in case things change through the Swift 2 releases.I think that before asking how you can implement an optional protocol method, you should be asking why you should implement one. If we think of swift protocols as an Interface in classic object oriented programming, optional methods do not make much sense, and perhaps a better solution would be to create default implementation, or separate the protocol into a set of protocols (perhaps with some inheritance relations between them) to represent the possible combination of methods in the protocol.For further reading, see https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-optional-protocol-methods/, which gives an excellent overview on this matter.Here\'s a very simple example for swift Classes ONLY, and not for structures or enumerations.\nNote that the protocol method being optional, has two levels of optional chaining at play. \nAlso the class adopting the protocol needs the @objc attribute in its declaration.if you want to do it in pure swift the best way is to provide a default implementation particullary if you return a Swift type like for example  struct with Swift typesexample :then you can implement protocol without defines every funcPut the @optional in front of methods or properties.
