I saw this keyword for the first time and I was wondering if someone could explain to me what it does.A continue statement without a label will re-execute from the condition the innermost while or do loop, and from the update expression of the innermost for loop.   It is often used to early-terminate a loop\'s processing and thereby avoid deeply-nested if statements.  In the following example continue will get the next line, without processing the following statement in the loop. With a label, continue will re-execute from the loop with the corresponding label, rather than the innermost loop.  This can be used to escape deeply-nested loops, or simply for clarity.  Sometimes continue is also used as a placeholder in order to make an empty loop body more clear.The same statement without a label also exists in C and C++.  The equivalent in Perl is next.This type of control flow is not recommended, but if you so choose you can also use continue to simulate a limited form of goto.  In the following example the continue will re-execute the empty for (;;) loop.continue is kind of like goto. Are you familiar with break? It\'s easier to think about them in contrast:break terminates the loop (jumps to the code below it).continue terminates the rest of the processing of the code within the loop for the current iteration, but continues the loop.Let\'s see an exampleThis would get the sum of only odd numbers from 1 to 100If you think of the body of a loop as a subroutine, continue is sort of like return. The same keyword exists in C, and serves the same purpose. Here\'s a contrived example:This will print out only the odd numbers.Generally, I see continue (and break) as a warning that the code might use some refactoring, especially if the while or for loop declaration isn\'t immediately in sight. The same is true for return in the middle of a method, but for a slightly different reason.As others have already said, continue moves along to the next iteration of the loop, while break moves out of the enclosing loop.These can be maintenance timebombs because there is no immediate link between the continue/break and the loop it is continuing/breaking other than context; add an inner loop or move the "guts" of the loop into a separate method and you have a hidden effect of the continue/break failing.IMHO, it\'s best to use them as a measure of last resort, and then to make sure their use is grouped together tightly at the start or end of the loop so that the next developer can  see the "bounds" of the loop in one screen.continue, break, and return (other than the One True Return at the end of your method) all fall into the general category of "hidden GOTOs". They place loop and function control in unexpected places, which then eventually causes bugs.Consider an If Else condition. A continue statement executes what is there in a condition and gets out of the condition i.e. jumps to next iteration or condition. But a Break leaves the loop. \nConsider the following Program. \'    It will print: aa cc Out of the loop. If you use break in place of continue(After if.), it will just print aa and out of the loop. If the condition "bb" equals ss is satisfied: \nFor Continue: It goes to next iteration i.e. "cc".equals(ss).\nFor Break: It comes out of the loop and prints "Out of the loop. "As already mentioned continue will skip processing the code below it and until the end of the loop. Then, you are moved to the loop\'s condition and run the next iteration if this condition still holds (or if there is a flag, to the denoted loop\'s condition).It must be highlighted that in the case of do - while you are moved to the condition at the bottom after a continue, not at the beginning of the loop.This is why a lot of people fail to correctly answer what the following code will generate.*If your answer is that aSet will contain odd numbers only 100%... you are wrong!
