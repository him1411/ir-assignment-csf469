I update nginx to 1.4.7 and php to 5.5.12, After that I got the 502 error. Before I update everything works fine.nginx-error.lognginx.confI had a similar error after php update. PHP fixed a security bug where o had rw permission to the socket file.Uncomment all permission lines, like:Restart fpm - sudo service php5-fpm restart or sudo service php7.0-fpm restartNote: if your webserver runs as user other than www-data, you will need to update the www.conf file accordinglyAll the fixes currently mentioned here basically enable the security hole all over again.What I ended up doing is adding the following lines to my PHP-FPM configuration file.Make sure that www-data is actually the user the nginx worker is running as. For debian it\'s www-data by default.Doing it this way does not enable the security problem that this change was supposed to fix.@Xander\'s solution works, but does not persist after a reboot. I found that I had to change listen.mode to 0660 in  /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf. Sample from www.conf:Edit: Per @Chris Burgess, I\'ve changed this to the more secure method.I removed the comment for listen.mode, .group and .owner:/var/run Only holds information about the running system since last boot, e.g., currently logged-in users and running daemons. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard#Directory_structure).Side note:My php5-fpm -v Reports: PHP 5.4.28-1+deb.sury.org~precise+1. The issue did happen after a recent update as well.If you have tried everything in this post but are not having success getting PHP to work, this is what fixed it for my case:Make sure you have these lines uncommented in /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf:Make sure /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params looks like this:These two lines were missing from my /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params, make sure they are there!Then, restart php5-fpm and nginx. Should do the trick.In fact, "listen.mode" should be: "0660" and not "0666" as Other Writable or Other Readable  is never a good choice here.So try to find out as which user/group your webserver runs. I use CentOs and it runs as user "nginx"\nSo add to your php-fpm.conf:finally restart php-fpmCheck which user runs nginx. As of Ubuntu 12.04 nginx runs by nginx user which is not a member of www-data group.usermod -a -G www-data nginxand restarting nginx and php5-fpm daemons solves the problem.Alternative to broadening permissions in your php config, you could change the user specified in your nginx config.On the first line of your nginx.conf excerpt above, the user and group are specified as www and www, respectively.Meanwhile, your php config probably specifies a user and group of www-data:You might change the line in your nginx.conf, to any of the following, then:Consideration must also be given to your individual FPM pools, if any.I couldn\'t figure out why none of these answers was working for me today. This had been a set-and-forget scenario for me, where I had forgotten that listen.user and listen.group were duplicated on a per-pool basis.If you used pools for different user accounts like I did, where each user account owns their FPM processes and sockets, setting only the default listen.owner and listen.group configuration options to \'nginx\' will simply not work. And obviously, letting \'nginx\' own them all is not acceptable either.For each pool, make sure thatOtherwise, you can leave the pool\'s ownership and such alone.I just got this error again today as I updated my machine (with updates for PHP) running Ubuntu 14.04. The distribution config file /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf is fine and doesn\'t require any changes currently. I found the following errors:The strange thing was that I have 2 sites running that utilize PHP-FPM on this machine one was running fine and the other (a Tiny Tiny RSS installation) gave me a 502, where both have been running fine before.I compared both configuration files and found that fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name; was missing for the affected site.Both configuration files now contain the following block and are running fine again:It should be noted that Ubuntu ships two fastcgi related parameter files and also a configuration snippet which is available since Vivid and also in the PPA version. The solution was updated accordingly.Diff of the fastcgi parameter files:Configuration snippet in /etc/nginx/snippets/fastcgi-php.confThe following simple fix worked for me, bypassing possible permissions issues with the socket.In your nginx config, set fastcgi_pass to:Instead of This must match the listen = parameter in /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf, so also set this to:Then restart php5-fpm and nginxAndFor more info, see: https://wildlyinaccurate.com/solving-502-bad-gateway-with-nginx-php-fpm/After upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 lts to Ubuntu 16.04 lts I found a yet another reason for this error that I haven\'t seen before.During the upgrading process I had somehow lost my php5-fpm executable altogether. All the config files were intact and it took me a while to realize that service php5-fpm start didn\'t really start a process, as it did not show any errors.My moment of awakening was when I noticed that there were no socket file in /var/run/php5-fpm.sock, as there should be, nor did netstat -an show processes listening on the port that I tried as an alternative while trying to solve this problem. Since the file /usr/sbin/php5-fpm was also non-existing, I was finally on the right track.In order to solve this problem I upgraded php from version 5.5 to 7.0. apt-get install php-fpm did the trick as a side effect. After that and installing other necessary packages everything was back to normal.This upgrading solution may have problems of its own, however. Since php has evolved quite a bit, it\'s possible that the software will break in unimaginable ways. So, even though I did go down that path, you may want to keep the version you\'re fond of just for a while longer.Luckily, there seems to be a neat way for that, as described on The Customize Windows site:Neater solution as it might be, I didn\'t try that. I expect the next couple of days will tell me whether I should have.The problem is my case was that the Nginx web server was running as user nginx and the pool was running as user www-data.I solved the issue by changing the user Nginx is running at in the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file (could be different on your system, mine is Ubuntu 16.04.1)Change: user nginx;to: user www-data;then restart Nginx: service nginx restartSimple but works..I have fixed  same issue on Amazon Linux AMI 2016.09 (Centos 7) by taking following steps.Open your www.conf files (Example : sudo nano /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf)\nLastly, find the lines that set the listen.owner and listen.group and change their values from "nobody" to "nginx":Lastly, find the lines that set the user and group and change their values from "apache" to "nginx":Restart php-fpm (sudo service php-fpm restart)Just to add, on CentOS (and probably Red Hat and Fedora) the file to change the permissions to is at:/etc/php-fpm.d/www.confI did change OS on my server quite a few times trying to get the most comfortable system.It used to work very well most of the time but lastly I got this 502 Gateway error.I use a php fpm socket for each account instead of keeping the same one for all. So if one crashes, at least the other applications keep running.I used to have user and group www-data. But this changed on my Debian 8 with latest Nginx 1.8 and php5-fpm.The default user is nginx and so is the group. To be sure of this, the best way is to check the /etc/group and /etc/passwd files. These can\'t lie.It is there I found that now I have nginx in both and no longer www-data. Maybe this can help some people still trying to find out why the error message keeps coming up.It worked for me.If you have different pool per user make sure user and group are set correctly in configuration file. You can find nginx user in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file. nginx group is same as nginx user.To those who tried everything in this thread and still stuck: This solved my problem.\nI updated /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.confUncomment the line saying usermake it www-data so it becomes: user www-data;Save it (root access required)Restart nginx
