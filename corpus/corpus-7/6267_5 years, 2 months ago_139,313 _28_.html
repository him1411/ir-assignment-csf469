Whenever I try to push into my repo git asks for both username & password. I have no problem in re-entering my password each time but the problem is in entering username. I use https to clone my repository.So, how can I configure git so that it doesn\'t asks for username on each git push.I am new to linux but IIRC in windows git push only asks for password.You can store your credentials using the following commandAlso I suggest you to read\n$ git help credentialsYou can accomplish this in the .git/config file of your local repository.

Check this SO answer.In addition to user701648\'s answer, you can store your credentials in your home folder (global for all projects), instead of project folder using the following commandIf you use SSH version, you will not have any problems with passwords.Only one time you generate SSH key, to tell git, that this pc will work with this github account and never ask me again about any access (for this pc).How To Generate SSH for Github$ git config credential.helper store$ git push/push https://github.com/xxx.gitThen enter your user name and password.To avoid entering username, but still be prompted to enter a password, then you can simply clone your repository including the username:
