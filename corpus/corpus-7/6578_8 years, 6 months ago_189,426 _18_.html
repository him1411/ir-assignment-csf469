What is the maximum size of a web browser\'s cookie\'s key?I know the maximum size of a cookie is 4KB, but does the key have a limitation as well?The 4K limit you read about is for the entire cookie, including name, value, expiry date etc. If you want to support most browsers, I suggest keeping the name under 4000 bytes, and the overall cookie size under 4093 bytes.One thing to be careful of: if the name is too big you cannot delete the cookie (at least in JavaScript). A cookie is deleted by updating it and setting it to expire. If the name is too big, say 4090 bytes, I found that I could not set an expiry date. I only looked into this out of interest, not that I plan to have a name that big.To read more about it, here are the "Browser Cookie Limits" for common browsers.While on the subject, if you want to support most browsers, then do not exceed 50 cookies per domain, and 4093 bytes per domain. That is, the size of all cookies should not exceed 4093 bytes.This means you can have 1 cookie of 4093 bytes, or 2 cookies of 2045 bytes, etc.I used to say 4095 bytes due to IE7, however now Mobile Safari comes in with 4096 bytes with a 3 byte overhead per cookie, so 4093 bytes max.Actually, RFC 2965, the document that defines how cookies work, specifies that there should be no maximum length of a cookie\'s key or value size, and encourages implementations to support arbitrarily large cookies. Each browser\'s implementation maximum will necessarily be different, so consult individual browser documentation.See section 5.3, "Implementation Limits", in the RFC. You can also use web storage too if the app specs allows you that (it has support for IE8+).It has 5M (most browsers) or 10M (IE) of memory at its disposal."Web Storage (Second Edition)" is the API and "HTML5 Local Storage" is a quick start. After testing a few browsers myself, and using Browser Shots I have compiled the following listA cookie key(used to identify a session) and a cookie are the same thing being used in different ways. So the limit would be the same. According to Microsoft its 4096 bytes.MSDN cookies are usually limited to 4096\n  bytes and you can\'t store more than 20\n  cookies per site. By using a single\n  cookie with subkeys, you use fewer of\n  those 20 cookies that your site is\n  allotted. In addition, a single cookie\n  takes up about 50 characters for\n  overhead (expiration information, and\n  so on), plus the length of the value\n  that you store in it, all of which\n  counts toward the 4096-byte limit. If\n  you store five subkeys instead of five\n  separate cookies, you save the\n  overhead of the separate cookies and\n  can save around 200 bytes.
