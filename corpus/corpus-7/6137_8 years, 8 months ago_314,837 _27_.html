I am using Python version 2.5.4 and install MySQL version 5.0 and Django. Django is working fine with Python, but not MySQL. I am using it in Windows Vista.You need to use one of the following commands. Which one depends on what OS and software you have and use.For Windows, see this answer: Install mysql-python (Windows)...and remember there is no MySQLdb for python3.x(I know the question is about python2.x but google rates this post quite high)EDIT: As stated in the comments, there\'s a MySQLdb\'s fork that adds Python 3 support: github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python\nmysqldb is a module for Python that doesn\'t come pre-installed or with Django. You can download mysqldb here.Ubuntu: if your python version is 3.5, do a pip install mysqlclient, other things didn\'t work for meIn CMD in settings.pyIt worked with me If you are on a virtual environment thenThanks to derevo but I think there\'s another good way for doing this:I think pypm is more powerful and reliable than easy_install.I met the same situation under windows, and searched for the solution.Seeing this post Install mysql-python (Windows).It points out installing such a pip environment is difficult, needs many other dependencies.But I finally know that if we use mysqlclient with a version down to 1.3.4, it don\'t need that requirements any more, so try:If you are running on Vista, you may want to check out the Bitnami Django stack. It is an all-in-one stack of Apache, Python, MySQL, etc. packaged with Bitrock crossplatform installers to make it really easy to get started. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. Oh, and is completely free :)I have tried methods above, but still no module named \'MySQLdb\', finally, I succeed with my env is unbuntu 14.04On OSX these commands worked for meand then add this two lines to your Project/Project/init.pyWorks on WIN and python 3.3+If your are using SQLAlchemy and the error is in /site-packages/sqlalchemy/dialects/mysql/mysqldb.py:so you may have missed mysqldb connector for SQLAlchemy and the solution is to re-install sqlalchemy after installing mysql-python module.
