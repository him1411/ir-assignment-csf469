I\'m adding TextViews programmatically in a for-loop and add them to an ArrayList.How do I use TextView.setId(int id)? What Integer ID do I come up with so it doesn\'t conflict with other IDs?According to View documentation The identifier does not have to be unique in this view\'s hierarchy. The identifier should be a positive number.So you can use any positive integer you like, but in this case there can be some views with equivalent id\'s. If you want to search for some view in hierarchy calling to setTag with some key objects may be handy. Google finally realized the need of generating unique IDs for programmatically created views...From API level 17 and above, you can call    View.generateViewId()Then use View.setId(int).In case you need it for targets lower than level 17, here is its internal implementation in View.java you can use directly in your project, put it in your util class or somewhere:ID number larger than 0x00FFFFFF is reserved for static views defined in the /res xml files. (Most likely 0x7f****** from the R.java in my projects.)   In your code, you can do: You can set ID\'s you\'ll use later in R.id class using an xml resource file, and let Android SDK give them unique values during compile time.\nTo use it in the code:Also you can define ids.xml in res/values. You can see an exact example in android\'s sample code.This works for me:Since API 17, the View class has a static method generateViewId() that will generate a value suitable for use in setId(int)(This was a comment to dilettante\'s answer but it got too long...hehe)Of course a static is not needed here.  You could use SharedPreferences to save, instead of static. Either way, the reason is to save the current progress so that its not too slow for complicated layouts. Because, in fact, after its used once, it will be rather fast later. However, I dont feel this is a good way to do it because if you have to rebuild your screen again (say onCreate gets called again), then you probably want to start over from the beginning anyhow, eliminating the need for static. Therefore, just make it an instance variable instead of static.Here is a smaller version that runs a bit faster and might be easier to read:This above function should be sufficient. Because, as far as I can tell, android-generated IDs are in the billions, so this will probably return 1 the first time and always be quite fast.\nBecause, it wont actually be looping past the used IDs to find an unused one. However, the loop is there should it actually find a used ID.However, if you still want the progress saved between subsequent recreations of your app, and want to avoid using static. Here is the SharedPreferences version:This answer to a similar question should tell you everything you need to know about IDs with android: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13241629/693927EDIT/FIX: Just realized I totally goofed up the save. I must have been drunk.Just an addition to the answer of @phantomlimb, while View.generateViewId() require API Level >= 17,\nthis tool is compatibe with all API.according to current API Level,\nit decide weather using system API or not.so you can use ViewIdGenerator.generateViewId() and View.generateViewId() in the\nsame time and don\'t worry about getting same idIn order to dynamically generate View Id  form API 17 usegenerateViewId()Which will generate a value suitable for use in setId(int). This value will not collide with ID values generated at build time by aapt for R.id....I use:By using a random number I always have a huge chance of getting the unique id in first attempt.
