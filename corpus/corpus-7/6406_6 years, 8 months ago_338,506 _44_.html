Can someone give a simple example of updating a textfield every second or so?I want to make a flying ball and need to calculate/update the ball coordinates every second, that\'s why I need some sort of a timer.I don\'t get anything from here.ok since this isn\'t cleared up yet there are 3 simple ways to handle this.\nBelow is an example showing all 3 and at the bottom is an example showing just the method I believe is preferable.  Also remember to clean up your tasks in onPause, saving state if necessary.the main thing to remember is that the UI can only be modified from the main ui thread so use a handler or activity.runOnUIThread(Runnable r);Here is what I consider to be the preferred method.It is simple!\nYou create new timer.   Then you extend the timer taskAnd then add the new task to the Timer with some update intervalDisclaimer: This is not the ideal solution. This is solution using the Timer class (as asked by OP). In Android SDK, it is recommended to use the Handler class (there is example in the accepted answer).If you also need to run your code on UI thread (and not on timer thread), take a look on the blog: http://steve.odyfamily.com/?p=12If one just want to schedule a countdown until a time in the future with regular notifications on intervals along the way, you can use the CountDownTimer class that is available since API level 1.This is some simple code for a timer:I think you can do it in Rx way like: And cancel this like:Rx Timer http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/timer.htmlYou want your UI updates to happen in the already-existent UI thread.The best way is to use a Handler that uses postDelayed to run a Runnable after a delay (each run schedules the next); clear the callback with removeCallbacks.You\'re already looking in the right place, so look at it again, perhaps clarify why that code sample isn\'t what you want.  (See also the identical article at Updating the UI from a Timer).He\'re is simplier solution, works fine in my app.Because this question is still attracting a lot of users from google search(about Android timer) I would like to insert my two coins.First of all, the Timer class will be deprecated in Java 9 (read the accepted answer). The official suggested way is to use ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor which is more effective and features-rich that can additionally schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically. Plus,it gives additional flexibility and capabilities of ThreadPoolExecutor.Here is an example of using plain functionalities.Create executor service:Just schedule you runnable:You can now use future to cancel the task or check if it is done for example:Hope you will find this useful for creating a tasks in Android.Complete example:You need to create a thread to handle the update loop and use it to update the textarea.  The tricky part though is that only the main thread can actually modify the ui so the update loop thread needs to signal the main thread to do the update.  This is done using a Handler.Check out this link: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html#\nClick on the section titled "Example ProgressDialog with a second thread".  It\'s an example of exactly what you need to do, except with a progress dialog instead of a textfield.If anyone is interested, I started playing around with creating a standard object to run on an activities UI thread.  Seems to work ok.  Comments welcome.  I\'d love this to be available on the layout designer as a component to drag onto an Activity.  Can\'t believe something like that doesn\'t already exist.In the activity, I have this onStart:Here is a simple reliable way...Put the following code in your Activity, and the tick() method will be called every second in the UI thread while your activity is in the "resumed" state.  Of course, you can change the tick() method to do what you want, or to be called more or less frequently.For those interested, the "_h0=_handler" code is necessary to avoid two timers running simultaneously if your activity is paused and resumed within the tick period..xml \n \n    \nYou can also use an animator for it:For those who can\'t rely on Chronometer, I made a utility class out of one of the suggestions:}to use..just do:.....If you have delta time already.
