I\'m trying to update my C++ compiler to C++11.\nI have searched a bit and I have come to the conclusion that I have to use the flag -std=c++0x or -std=gnu++0x, but I don\'t know many things about flags. Can anyone help me? (I\'m using Ubuntu 12.04.)Here is the error that i get from the compiler when i attempt to use a library which is included in C++11(i.e. array):This file requires compiler and library support for the upcoming ISO C++ standard, C++0x. This support is currently experimental, and must be enabled with the -std=c++0x or -std=gnu++0x compiler options.Flags (or compiler options) are nothing but ordinary command line arguments passed to the compiler executable.Assuming you are invoking g++ from the command line (terminal):$ g++ -std=c++11 your_file.cpp -o your_programor$ g++ -std=c++0x your_file.cpp -o your_programif the above doesn\'t work.You can check your g++ by command:this will tell you which complier is currently it is pointing.To switch to g++ 4.7 (assuming that you have installed it in your machine),run:Then select 2 as selection(My machine already pointing to g++ 4.7,so the *)Once you switch the complier then again run g++ --version to check the switching has happened correctly.Now compile your program with Your ubuntu definitely has a sufficiently recent version of g++. The flag to use is -std=c++0x.If you want to keep the GNU compiler extensions, use -std=gnu++0x rather than -std=c++0x. Here\'s a quote from the man page:The compiler can accept several base standards, such as c89 or c++98,\n  and GNU dialects of those standards, such as gnu89 or gnu++98. By\n  specifying a base standard, the compiler will accept all programs\n  following that standard and those using GNU extensions that do not\n  contradict it. For example, -std=c89 turns off certain features of GCC\n  that are incompatible with ISO C90, such as the "asm" and "typeof"\n  keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in\n  ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a "?:" expression. On the\n  other hand, by specifying a GNU dialect of a standard, all features\n  the compiler support are enabled, even when those features change the\n  meaning of the base standard and some strict-conforming programs may\n  be rejected.  The particular standard is used by -pedantic to identify\n  which features are GNU extensions given that version of the standard.\n  For example-std=gnu89 -pedantic would warn about C++ style //\n  comments, while -std=gnu99 -pedantic would not.
