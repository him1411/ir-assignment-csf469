I have a basic node.js app that I am trying to get off the ground using Express framework.  I have a views folder where I have an index.html file.  But I receive the following error when loading the web browser.Error: Cannot find module \'html\'Below is my code.  What am I missing here?You can have jade include a plain HTML page:in views/index.jadein views/plain.htmland app.js can still just render jade:Many of these answers are out of date.Using express 3.0.0 and 3.1.0, the following works:See the comments below for alternative syntax and caveats for express 3.4+:Then you can do something like:This assumes you have your views in the views subfolder, and that you have installed the ejs node module. If not, run the following on a Node console:From the Express.js Guide: View RenderingView filenames take the form Express.ENGINE, where ENGINE is the name of the module that will be required. For example the view layout.ejs will tell the view system to require(\'ejs\'), the module being loaded must export the method exports.render(str, options) to comply with Express, however app.register() can be used to map engines to file extensions, so that for example foo.html can be rendered by jade.So either you create your own simple renderer or you just use jade:More about app.register.Note that in Express 3, this method is renamed app.enginetry this. it works for me.You could also read the html file and send it.If you\'re using express@~3.0.0 change the line below from your example:to something like this:I made it as described on express api page and it works like charm. With that setup you don\'t have to write additional code so it becomes easy enough to use for your micro production or testing.Full code listed below:I also faced the same issue in express 3.X and node 0.6.16. The above given solution will not work for latest version express 3.x. They removed the app.register method and added app.engine method. If you tried the above solution you may end up with the following error.To get rid of the error message. Add the following line to your app.configure functionNote: you have to install ejs template engineExample: Note: The simplest solution is to use ejs template as view engine. There you can write raw HTML in *.ejs view files.If you don\'t have to use the views directory, Simply move html files to the public directory below.and then, add this line into app.configure instead of \'/views\'.For my project I have created this structure:This code serves index.html for / requests, and reset.css for /css/reset.css requests. Simple enough, and the best part is that it automatically adds cache headers.With Express 4.0.0, the only thing you have to do is comment out 2 lines in app.js:And then drop your static file into the /public directory. Example: /public/index.htmlI added below 2 line and it work for meTo render Html page in node try the following,You need to install ejs module through npm like:I was trying to set up an angular app with an express RESTful API and landed on this page multiple times though it wasn\'t helpful. Here\'s what I found that worked:Then in the callback for your api routes look like: res.jsonp(users);Your client side framework can handle routing. Express is for serving the API.My home route looks like this:Try res.sendFile() function in Express routes.Read here : http://codeforgeek.com/2015/01/render-html-file-expressjs/I didn\'t want to depend on ejs for simply delivering an HTML file, so I simply wrote the tiny renderer myself:folder structure:server.jsindex.htmloutput: hello world1)\nThe best way is to set static folder. In your main file (app.js | server.js | ???):public/css/form.html\npublic/css/style.cssThen you got static file from "public" folder:2)You can create your file cache.\nUse method fs.readFileSyncAdd the following Lines to your codeReplace "jade" with "ejs" & "X.Y.Z"(version) with "*" in package.json fileThen in your app.js File Add following Code :app.engine(\'html\', require(\'ejs\').renderFile);app.set(\'view engine\', \'html\');And Remember Keep All .HTML files in views FolderCheers :)Here is a full file demo of express server!https://gist.github.com/xgqfrms-GitHub/7697d5975bdffe8d474ac19ef906e906hope it will help for you!I wanted to allow requests to "/" to be handled by an Express route where previously they had been handled by the statics middleware. This would allow me to render the regular version of index.html or a version that loaded concatenated + minified JS and CSS, depending on application settings. Inspired by Andrew Homeyer\'s answer, I decided to drag my HTML files - unmodified - into a views folder, configure Express like soAnd created a route handler like so This worked out pretty well.In server.js, please includeI usually use thisJust be careful because that\'ll share anything in the /web directory.I hope it helpsif you are using express framework to node.js install npm ejs then add config file ;render the page from exports module form.js\nhave the html file in the views dir\n   with extension of ejs file name as\nform.html.ejsthen create the form.jsres.render(\'form.html.ejs\'); //@Error: Cannot find module \'html\'//.. file is somewhere else!!!
