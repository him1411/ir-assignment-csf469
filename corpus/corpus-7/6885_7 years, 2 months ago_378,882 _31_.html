It seems that PHP\'s == operator is case sensitive? So is there any reason to use strcmp()? Is it safe to do something like:The reason to use it is because strcmpreturns < 0 if str1 is less than str2; > 0 if str1 is greater than str2, and 0 if they are equal.== only returns true or false, it doesn\'t tell you which is the "greater" string.You should never use == for string comparison. === is OK.Just run the above code and you\'ll see why.Now, that\'s a little better.Don\'t use == in PHP. It will not do what you expect. Even if you are comparing strings to strings, PHP will implicitly cast them to floats and do a numerical comparison if they appear numerical.For example \'1e3\' == \'1000\' returns true.Well..according to this php bug report , you can even get 0wned.It gives you a warning , but still bypass the comparison.\nYou should be doing === as @postfuturist suggested.Always remember, when comparing strings, you should use === operator (strict comparison) and not == operator (loose comparison).Using == might be dangerous.Note, that it would cast the variable to another data type if the two differs.Examples:As you can see, these two are from different types, but the result is true, which might not be what your code will expect.Using ===, however, is recommended as test shows that it\'s a bit faster than strcmp() and its case-insensitive alternative strcasecmp().Quick googling yells this speed comparison: http://snipplr.com/view/758/strcmp() and "===" are both case sensitive but "===" is much fastersample code: http://snipplr.com/view/758/strcmp will return different values based on the environment it is running(Linux/Windows)!The reason is the that it has a bug as the bug report says  https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=53999Please handle with care!!Thank you.Also The function can help in sorting. To be more clear about sorting. strcmp() returns less than 0 if string1 sorts before string2, greater than 0 if string2 sorts before string1 or 0 if they are the same. For example The function will return greater than zero, as aaao is sorting before aabo.You can use strcmp() if you wish to order/compare strings lexicographically. If you just wish to check for equality then == is just fine.Summing up all answers :== is a bad idea for string comparisons.\nIt will give you "surprising" results in many cases.  Don\'t trust it.=== is fine, and will give you the best performance.strcmp() should be used if you need to determine which string is "greater", typically for sorting operations.String comparison using  strcmp
