I am trying to add an unique index that gets created from the foreign keys of four associated tables (users, universities, subject_names, subject_types):MySQL\'s limitation for the index name causes the migration to stop. Here is the error message:Index name \'index_studies_on_user_id_and_university_id_and_subject_name_id_and_subject_type_id\' on table \'studies\' is too long; the limit is 64 charactersHow can I handle this? Can I use an alias?Use:More information is in add_index.
