How do you get the length of a string stored in a variable and assign that to another variable?How do you set another variable to the output 11?In addition to fedorqui\'s correct answer, I would like to show the difference between string length and byte length:will render:you could even have a look at stored chars:will answer:Argument work same as regular variableswill work asThen now:To get the length of a string stored in a variable, say:To confirm it was properly saved, echo it:You can use:If you want to use this with command line or function arguments, make sure you use size=${#1} instead of size=${#$1}. The second one may be  more instinctual but is incorrect syntax.In response to the post starting:If you want to use this with command line or function arguments...with the code: There might be the case where you just want to check for a zero length argument and have no need to store a variable. I believe you can use this sort of syntax:See GNU and wooledge for a more complete list of Bash conditional expressions.I would use something like this:You don\'t need a script.
