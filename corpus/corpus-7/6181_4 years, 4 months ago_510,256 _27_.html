I have a bootstrap modal dialog box that I want to show initially, then when the user clicks on the page, it disappears. I have the following:The modal is displayed initially, but it does not close when clicked outside of the modal. Also, the content area is not greyed out.. How can I get the modal to display initially, then close after the user clicks outside the area? And how can I get the background to be grayed out as in the demo?Put modal(\'toggle\') instead of modal(toggle)to close bootstrap modal you can pass \'hide\' as option to modal method as followPlease take a look at working fiddle herebootstrap also provide events that you can hook into modal functionality, like if you want to fire a event when the modal has finished being hidden from the user you can use hidden.bs.modal event you can read more about modal methods and events here in DocumentationIf none of the above method work, give a id to your close button and trigger click on close button.or should work.But if nothing else works you can call the modal close button directly:this worked for me:use this link modal closeRunning this call via class ($(".my-modal")) won\'t work.My five cents on this one is that I don\'t want to have to target the bootstrap modal with an id and seeing as there should be only one modal at a time the following should be quite sufficient to remove the modal as toggle could be dangerous:In some circumstances typing error could be the culprit. For instance, make sure you have:and not Notice the double "ss" in the second example that will cause the Close button that fail.this one is pretty good and it also works in angular 2 We can close the modal pop-up in the following ways:Using  modal.hide would only hide the modal. If you are using overlay underneath the modal, it would still be there. use click call to actually close the modal and remove the overlay.Besides, you can "click" on a \'x\', that closes dialog.\nE.g.:$(".ui-dialog-titlebar-close").click();Another way of doing this is that first you remove the class modal-open, which closes the modal. Then you remove the class modal-backdrop that removes the grayish cover of the modal. Following code can be used:$(\'.modal.in\').modal(\'hide\');use the above code to hide the backdrop of modal if you are using multiple modal pop in one page.
