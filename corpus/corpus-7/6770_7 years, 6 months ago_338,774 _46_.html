This problem is killing me. How does one roundup a number UP in Python?I tried round(number) but it round the number down. Example:The I tried int(number + .5) but it round the number down again! Example:Then I tried round(number + .5) but it won\'t work in edge cases. Example:Please advise.The ceil (ceiling) function:Interesting Python 2.x issue to keep in mind:The problem is that dividing two ints in python produces another int and that\'s rounded before the ceiling call. You have to make one value a float (or cast) to get a correct result.In javascript, the exact same code produces a different result:I know this answer is for a question from a while back, but if you don\'t want to import math and you just want to round up, this works for me.The first part becomes 4 and the second part evaluates to "True" if there is a remainder, which in addition True = 1; False = 0. So if there is no remainder, then it stays the same integer, but if there is a remainder it adds 1.You might also like numpy:I\'m not saying it\'s better than math, but if you were already using numpy for other purposes, you can keep your code consistent. Anyway, just a detail I came across. I use numpy a lot and was surprised it didn\'t get mentioned, but of course the accepted answer works perfectly fine.If working with integers, one way of rounding up is to take advantage of the fact that // rounds down: Just do the division on the negative number, then negate the answer.  No import, floating point, or conditional needed.For example:Use math.ceil to round up:NOTE: The input should be float.If you need an integer, call int to convert it:BTW, use math.floor to round down and round to round to nearest integer.The syntax may not be as pythonic as one might like, but it is a powerful library.https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.htmlBe shure rounded value should be float butI am surprised nobody suggestedfor integer division with rounding up. Used to be the common way for C/C++/CUDA (cf. divup)The above answers are correct, however, importing the math module just for this one function usually feels like a bit of an overkill for me. Luckily, there is another way to do it:True and False are interpreted as 1 and 0 in a statement involving numbers in python. g.is_interger() basically translates to g.has_no_decimal() or g == int(g). So the last statement in English reads round g down and add one if g has decimal.I\'m surprised I haven\'t seen this answer yet round(x + 0.4999), so I\'m going to put it down. Note that this works with any Python version. Changes made to the Python rounding scheme has made things difficult. See this post.Without importing, I use:Why this worksFrom the docsFor the built-in types supporting round(), values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus n; if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choiceTherefore 2.5 gets rounded to 2 and 3.5 gets rounded to 4. If this was not the case then rounding up could be done by adding 0.5, but we want to avoid getting to the halfway point. So, if you add 0.4999 you will get close, but with enough margin to be rounded to what you would normally expect. Of course, this will fail if the x + 0.4999 is equal to [n].5000, but that is unlikely.when you operate 4500/1000 in python, result will be 4, because for default python asume as integer the result, logically:\n4500/1000 = 4.5  -->  int(4.5) = 4\nand ceil of 4 obviouslly is 4using 4500/1000.0 the result will be 4.5 and ceil of 4.5 --> 5Using javascript you will recieve 4.5 as result of 4500/1000, because javascript asume only the result as "numeric type" and return a result directly as floatGood Luck!!To do it without any import:I know this is from quite a while back, but I found a quite interesting answer, so here goes:This fixes the edges cases and works for both positive and negative numbers, and doesn\'t require any function importCheersYou can use floor devision and add 1 to it.\n2.3 // 2 + 1If you don\'t want to import anything, you can always write your own simple function as:def RoundUP(num):\n    if num== int(num):\n        return num\n    return int(num + 1)\nI\'m basically a beginner at Python, but if you\'re just trying to round up instead of down why not do:
