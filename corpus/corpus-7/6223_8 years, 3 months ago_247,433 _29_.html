It amazes me that Javascript\'s Date object does not implement an add function of any kind.I simply want a function that can do this:I would simply like some pointers in a direction.Do I need to do string parsing?  Can I use setTime?How about milliseconds?Like this:This seems really hackish though - and does it even work?JavaScript itself has terrible Date/Time API\'s. This is the only way to do it in pure JavaScript. I\'d recommend using Datejs - as suggested by Nosredna - if you\'re doing a lot of date manipulation, though.Test:The below code is to add 4 hours to date(example today\'s date)It is probably better to make the addHours method immutable by returning a copy of the Date object rather than mutating its parameter.This way you can chain a bunch of method calls without worrying about state.You can use the momentjs http://momentjs.com/ Library.The version suggested by kennebec will fail when changing to or from DST, since it is the hour number that is set. will add h hours to this independent of time system peculiarities.\nJason Harwig\'s method works as well.There is an add in the Datejs library.And here are the JavaScript date methods. kennebec wisely mentioned getHours() and setHours();I also think the original object should not be modified. So to save future manpower here\'s a combined solution based on Jason Harwig\'s and Tahir Hasan answers:Check if its not already defined, otherwise defines it on the Date prototype:For a simple add/subtract hour/minute function in javascript, try this:This can be used without parameters to get the current timeor with parameters to get the time with the added minutes/hourseven negative time worksthis function returns an array of Another way to handle this is to convert the date to unixtime (epoch), then add the equivalent in (milli)seconds, then convert it back. This way you can handle day and month transitions, like adding 4 hours to 21, which should result in the next day, 01:00. If you don\'t want to use a library and would prefer a plain javascript solution, you can use this dateAdd() function I wrote. It works with daylight saving time and lets you add minutes, hours, days, weeks, etc.Example:This would return a date object incremented by 4 hours.
