I can attach to a docker process but Ctrl+c doesn\'t work to detach from it. exit basically halts the process. What\'s the recommended workflow to have the process running, occasionally attaching to it to make some changes, and then detaching?To detach the tty without exiting the shell, use the escape sequence Ctrl+p + Ctrl+q.more details here:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/Check out also the --sig-proxy option:Then use CTRL+c to detachIf you just want to make some modification to files or inspect processes, here\'s one another solution you probably want.You could run the following command to execute a new process from the existing container:sudo docker exec -ti [CONTAINER-ID] bashwill start a new process with bash shell, and you could escape from it by ^c directly, it won\'t affect the original process.I think this should depend on the situation.Take the following container as an example:  (1) Use "docker attach" to attach the container:  Since "docker attach" will not allocate a new tty, but reuse the original running tty, so if you run exit command, it will cause the running container exit:  So unless you really want to make running container exit, you should use Ctrl+p + Ctrl+q.  (2) Use "docker exec"Since "docker exec" will allocate a new tty, so I think you should use exit instead of Ctrl+p + Ctrl+q.  The following is executing Ctrl+p + Ctrl+q to quit the container:  Then login container again, you will see the bash process in preavious docker exec command is still alive (PID is 15):  when nothing else works, open a new terminal then:To detach from the container you simply hold Ctrl and press P + Q.To attach to a running container you use: docker attach "container_name".Enjoy!to stop a docker process and release the ports, first use ctrl-c to leave the exit the container then use docker ps to find the list of running containers. Then you can use the docker container stop  to stop that process and release its ports. The container name you can find from the docker ps command which gives the name in the name column. Hope this solves your queries....In the same shell, hold ctrl key and press keys p then q
