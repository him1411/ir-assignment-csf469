I know this is a basic question, but I couldn\'t find an answer.Why use it? if you write a function or a method that\'s using it, when you remove it the code will still work perfectly, 100% as without it. E.g:With params:Without params:With params you can call your method like this:Without params, you can\xe2\x80\x99t.Additionally, you can call the method with an array as a parameter in both cases:That is, params allows you to use a shortcut when calling the method.Unrelated, you can drastically shorten your method:Using params allows you to call the function with no arguments. Without params:Compare with params:Generally, you can use params when the number of arguments can vary from 0 to infinity, and use an array when numbers of arguments vary from 1 to infinity.It allows you to add as many base type parameters in your call as you like.whereas with the second form you have to use an array as parameterNo need to create overload methods, just use one single method with params as shown belowOne danger with params keyword is if you accidentally / intentionally remove required Parameters prior to the params and the required Parameter(s) are Type-Compatible with the params Parameter, your code will continue to compile with the required parameters being treated as teh optional params Parameter.  I just ran into the worst possible case of this: the params Parameter was of Type object[].  For that reason alone, for me, it\'s not worth the shortcut.  (Type)[] without params will work with 0 to infinity # of Parameters without needing Overrides.  Worst case, you\'ll have to add a , new (Type) [] {} to Calls where it doesn\'t apply.params also allows you to call the method with a single argument.i.e. Foo(1); instead of Foo(new int[] { 1 });. Can be useful for shorthand in scenarios where you might need to pass in a single value rather than an entire array. It still is handled the same way in the method, but gives some candy for calling this way.Adding params keyword itself shows that you can pass multiple number of parameters while calling that method which is not possible without using it. To be more specific:When you will call above method you can call it by any of the following ways:But when you will remove params keyword only third way of the above given ways will work fine. For 1st and 2nd case you will get an error.
