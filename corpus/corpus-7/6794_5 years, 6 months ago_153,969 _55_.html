I try to add margin values on a div inside another div. All works fine except the top value, it seems to be ignored. But why?What I expected:\nWhat I get:\nCode:W3Schools have no explanation to why margin behave this way.You\'re actually seeing the top margin of the #inner element collapse into the top edge of the #outer element, leaving only the #outer margin intact (albeit not shown in your images). The top edges of both boxes are flush against each other because their margins are equal.Here are the relevant points from the W3C spec:In CSS, the adjoining margins of two or more boxes (which might or might not be siblings) can combine to form a single margin. Margins that combine this way are said to collapse, and the resulting combined margin is called a collapsed margin.Adjoining vertical margins collapse [...]Two margins are adjoining if and only if:The reason why doing any of the following prevents the margin from collapsing:Is because:The left and right margins behave as you expect because:Horizontal margins never collapse.Try using display: inline-block; on the inner div.What @BoltClock mentioned are pretty solid.\nAnd Here I just want to add several more solutions for this problem.\ncheck this w3c_collapsing margin. The green parts are the potential thought how this problem can be solved.Solution 1Margins between a floated box and any other box do not collapse (not even between a float and its in-flow children).that means I can add float:left to either #outer or #inner demo1.also notice that float would invalidate the auto in margin.Solution 2Margins of elements that establish new block formatting contexts (such as floats and elements with \'overflow\' other than \'visible\') do not collapse with their in-flow children.other than visible, let\'s put overflow: hidden into #outer. And this way seems pretty simple and decent. I like it.Solution 3Margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not collapse (not even with their in-flow children).or these two methods will break the normal flow of divSolution 4Margins of inline-block boxes do not collapse (not even with their in-flow children).is the same as @enderskillSolution 5The bottom margin of an in-flow block-level element always collapses with the top margin of its next in-flow block-level sibling, unless that sibling has clearance.This has not much work to do with the question since it is the collapsing margin between siblings. it generally means if a top-box has margin-bottom: 30px and a sibling-box has margin-top: 10px. The total margin between them is 30px instead of 40px.Solution 6The top margin of an in-flow block element collapses with its first in-flow block-level child\'s top margin if the element has no top border, no top padding, and the child has no clearance.This is very interesting and I can just add one top border lineAnd Also <div> is block-level in default, so you don\'t have to declare it on purpose. Sorry for not being able to post more than 2 links and images due to my novice reputation. At least you know where the problem comes from next time you see something similar.If you add any padding to #outer, it works.Demo Not exactly sure why, but changing the inner CSS toseems to work;Not sure why what you have doesn\'t work, but you can addoverflow: auto; to the outer div.Doesn\'t answer the "why" (has to be something w/ collapsing margin), but seems like the easiest/most logical way to do what you\'re trying to do would be to just add padding-top to the outer div:http://jsfiddle.net/hpU5d/1/Minor note - it shouldn\'t be necessary to set a div to display:block; unless there\'s something else in your code telling it not to be block.try this:http://jsfiddle.net/7AXTf/Good luckI guess setting the position property of the #inner div to relative may also help achieve the effect. But anyways I tried the original code pasted in the Question on IE9 and latest Google Chrome and they already give the desirable effect without any modifications.Use padding-top:50pxfor outer div. Something like this:Note: padding will increase the size of your div. In this case if the size of your div is important, I mean if it must have a specific height. decrease the height by 50px.:Have you tried !important before all, it will force everything:
