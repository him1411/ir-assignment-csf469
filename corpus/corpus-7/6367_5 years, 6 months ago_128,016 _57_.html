I want to use Node because it\'s swift, uses the same language I am using on the client side, and it\'s non-blocking by definition.  But the guy who I hired to write the program for file handling (saving, editing, renaming, downloading, uploading files, etc.), he wants to use apache.  So, I must:Convince him to use Node (he\'s giving up little ground on that)Figure out how to upload, download, rename, save, etc. files in node orI must install apache and node on the same server.Which is the most favorable situation, and how do I implement that?Great question!There are many websites and free web apps implemented in PHP that run on Apache, lots of people use it so you can mash up something pretty easy and besides, its a no-brainer way of serving static content. Node is fast, powerful, elegant, and a sexy tool with the raw power of V8 and a flat stack with no in-built dependencies. I also want the ease/flexibility of Apache and yet the grunt and elegance of Node.JS, why cant I have both?Fortunately with the ProxyPass directive in the Apache httpd.conf its not too hard to pipe all requests on a particular URL to your Node.JS application.Also, make sure the following lines are NOT commented out so you get the right proxy and submodule to reroute http requests:Then run your Node app on port 8000!Then you can access all Node.JS logic using the /node/ path on your url, the rest of the website can be left to Apache to host your existing PHP pages:Now the only thing left is convincing your hosting company let your run with this configuration!!!This question belongs more on Server Fault but FWIW I\'d say running Apache in front of Node.js is not a good approach in most cases.Apache\'s ProxyPass is awesome for lots of things (like exposing Tomcat based services as part of a site) and if your Node.js app is just doing a specific, small role or is an internal tool that\'s only likely to have a limited number of users then it might be easier just to use it so you can get it working and move on, but that doesn\'t sound like the case here.If you want to take advantage of the performance and scale you\'ll get from using Node.js - and especially if you want to use something that involves maintaining a persistent connection like web sockets - you are better off running both Apache and your Node.js on other ports (e.g. Apache on localhost:8080, Node.js on localhost:3000) and then running something like nginx, Varnish or HA proxy in front - and routing traffic that way.With something like varnish or nginx you can route traffic based on path and/or host. They both use much less system resources and is much more scalable that using Apache to do the same thing. Instructions to run node server along apache2(v2.4.xx) server:\n\n In order to pipe all requests on a particular URL to your Node.JS application create CUSTOM.conf file inside /etc/apache2/conf-available directory, and add following line to the created file:Change 8000 to the prefered port number for node server. \nEnable custom configurations with following command:CUSTOM is your newly created filename without extension, then enable proxy_http with the command:it should enable both proxy and proxy_http modules. You can check whether module is enabled or not with:After configuration and modules enabled, you will need to restart apache server:Now you can execute node server. All requests to the URL/node will be handled by node server.Running Node and Apache on one server is trivial as they don\'t conflict. NodeJS is just a way to execute JavaScript server side. The real dilemma comes from accessing both Node and Apache from outside. As I see it you have two choices:Set up Apache to proxy all matching requests to NodeJS, which will do the file uploading and whatever else in node.Have Apache and Node on different IP:port combinations (if your server has two IPs, then one can be bound to your node listener, the other to Apache).I\'m also beginning to suspect that this might not be what you are actually looking for. If your end goal is for you to write your application logic in Nodejs and some "file handling" part that you off-load to a contractor, then its really a choice of language, not a web server.you can use a different approach such as writing a reverse proxy server with nodejs to proxy both apache and all other nodejs apps.fist you need to make apache run on different port other than port 80. ex: port 8080then you can write a reverse proxy script with nodejs as:following article describes the whole process of making this.http://wathmal.me/blog/run-apache-with-node-js-reverse-proxy/I was looking for the same information. Finally found the answer from the link on the answer above by @Straseushttp://arguments.callee.info/2010/04/20/running-apache-and-node-js-together/Here is the final solution to run apache website on port 80, node js service on port 8080 and use .htaccess RewriteRuleIn the DocumentRoot of the apache website, add the following:For the directory level redirect, the link above suggested (.+) rule, which requires one or more character after the \'node/\'. I had to convert it to (.*) which is zero or more for my stuff to work.Thanks a lot for the link @StraseusI am assuming that you are making a web app because you refer to Apache and Node. Quick answer - Is it possible - YES. Is it recommended - NO. Node bundles it\'s own webserver and most websites run on port 80. I am also assuming that there is currently no Apache plugin which is supported by Nodejs and I am not sure if creating a virtual host is the best way to implement this. These are the questions that should be answered by developers who maintain Nodejs like the good folks at Joyent.Instead of ports, it would be better to evaluate Node\'s tech stack which is completely different from most others and which is why I love it but it also involves a few compromises that you should be aware of in advance. Your example looks similar to a CMS or a sharing web app and there are hundreds of out of the box apps available that will run just fine on Apache. Even if you do not like any readymade solution, you could write a webapp in PHP / Java / Python or mix n match it with a couple of ready made apps and they are all designed and supported to run behind a single instance of Apache.It\'s time to pause and think about what I just said.Now you are ready to decide on which techstack you are going to use. If your website will never use any out of the thousands of ready made apps that require Apache, then go for Node otherwise you must first eliminate the assumptions that I have stated earlier.In the end, your choice of techstack is way more important than any individual component.I completely agree with @Straseus that it is relatively trivial to use node.js file system api for handling uploads and downloads but think more about what you want from your website in the long run and then choose your techstack.Learning Node\'s framework is easier than learning other frameworks but it is not a panacea. With a slightly more effort (which may be a worthwhile endeavor in itself), you can learn any other framework too. We all learn from each other and you will be more productive if you are working as a small team than if you are working alone and your backend technical skills will also develop faster. Therefore, do not discount the skills of other members of your team so cheaply. This post is about a year old and chances are that you have already decided but I hope that my rant will help the next person who is going through a similar decision.Thanks for reading.You can install both on the same server, but they need to be configured to use different ports. Both cannot use port 80, not so easily at least.Keep in mind that Apache is a server, and nodeJS is a language.Have you tried googling the issue before asking here?http://arguments.callee.info/2010/04/20/running-apache-and-node-js-together/What do I need to run a node.js script on my server?http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2010/12/how-to-run-apache-and-nodejs.phphttp://eastmond.org/blog/?p=45
