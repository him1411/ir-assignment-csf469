I\'ve seen lots of other questions similar to this (here, here and here), but they all have accepted answers that don\'t solve my problem. The best solution I have found to the problem is the StyledMarker library, which does let you define custom colours for markers, but I can\'t get it to use the default marker (the one you get when you do a google maps search - with a dot in the middle), it just seems to provide markers with a letter in, or with a special icon.You can dynamically request icon images from the Google charts api with the urls:Which looks like this:  the image is 21x34 pixels and the pin tip is at position (10, 34)And you\'ll also want a separate shadow image (so that it doesn\'t overlap nearby icons):Which looks like this:  the image is 40x37 pixels and the pin tip is at position (12, 35)When you construct your MarkerImages you need to set the size and anchor points accordingly:You can then add the marker to your map with:Simply replace "FE7569" with the color code you\'re after. Eg: Credit due to Jack B Nimble for the inspiration ;)If you use Google Maps API v3 you can use setIcon e.g.Or as part of marker init:Other colours:Use the following piece of code to update default markers with different colors.Here is a nice solution using the Gooogle Maps API itself. No external service, no extra library. And it enables custom shapes and multiple colors and styles. The solution is using vectorial markers, which googlemaps api calls Symbols.Besides the few and limited predefined symbols, you can craft any shape of any color by specifying an SVG path string (Spec).To use it, instead of setting the \'icon\' marker option to the image url, you set it to a dictionary containing the symbol options. As example, I managed to craft one symbol that is quite similar to the standard marker:I you are careful to keep the shape key point at 0,0 you avoid having to define marker icon centering parameters. Another path example, the same marker without the dot:And here you have a very simple and ugly coloured flag:You can also create the paths using a visual tool like Inkscape (GNU-GPL, multiplatform). Some useful hints:Well the closest thing I\'ve been able to get with the StyledMarker is this.The bullet in the middle isn\'t quite a big as the default one though. The StyledMarker class simply builds this url and asks the google api to create the marker. From the class use example use "%E2%80%A2" as your text, as in: You will need to modifiy StyledMarker.js to comment out the lines:as this will trim the text string to 2 characters.Alternatively you could create custom marker images based on the default one with the colors you desire and override the default marker with code such as this:Hi you can use icon as SVG and set colors. See this codesince version 3.11 of the google maps API, the Icon object replaces MarkerImage. Icon supports the same parameters as MarkerImage. I even found it to be a bit more straight forward.An example could look like this:for further information check this siteI\'ve extended vokimon\'s answer a bit, making it a bit more convenient for changing other properties as well.Usage:Or when defining a new marker:In Internet Explorer, this solution does not work in ssl.One can see the error in console as:SEC7111: HTTPS security is compromised by this,Workaround : As one of the user here suggested replace \n  chart.apis.google.com to chart.googleapis.com for the URL path to avoid SSL error.You can use this code it works fine.change it to chart.googleapis.com for the path, otherwise SSL won\'t workUsing swift and Google Maps Api v3, this was the easiest way I was able to do it:hope it helps someone.These are costume Circular markerssmall_red: small_yellow:small_green:small_blue:small_purple:They are 9x9 png images.\nOnce they\'re on your page you can just drag them off and you\'ll have the actual png file.I try two ways to create the custom google map marker, this run code used canvg.js is the best compatibility for browser.the Commented-Out Code is not support IE11 urrently.
