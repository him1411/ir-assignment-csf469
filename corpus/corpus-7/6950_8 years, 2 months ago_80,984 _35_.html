How safe is it to use UUID to uniquely identify something (I\'m using it for files uploaded to the server)? As I understand it, it is based off random numbers. However, it seems to me that given enough time, it would eventually repeat it self, just by pure chance. Is there a better system or a pattern of some type to alleviate this issue?Very safe: the annual risk of a given person being hit by a meteorite is\n  estimated to be one chance in 17 billion, which means the\n  probability is about 0.00000000006 (6 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x88\x9211), equivalent to the odds\n  of creating a few tens of trillions of UUIDs in a year and having one\n  duplicate. In other words, only after generating 1 billion UUIDs every\n  second for the next 100 years, the probability of creating just one\n  duplicate would be about 50%.Caveat:However, these probabilities only hold when the UUIDs are generated\n  using sufficient entropy. Otherwise, the probability of duplicates\n  could be significantly higher, since the statistical dispersion might\n  be lower. Where unique identifiers are required for distributed\n  applications, so that UUIDs do not clash even when data from many\n  devices is merged, the randomness of the seeds and generators used on\n  every device must be reliable for the life of the application. Where\n  this is not feasible, RFC4122 recommends using a namespace variant\n  instead.\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID#Random_UUID_probability_of_duplicatesWikepedia article has this section removed, but they have a useful reference External link to it somewhere else:\nhttp://www.h2database.com/html/advanced.html#uuidIf by "given enough time" you mean 100 years and you\'re creating them at a rate of a billion a second, then yes, you have a 50% chance of having a collision after 100 years.There is more than one type of UUID, so "how safe" depends on which type (which the UUID specifications call "version") you are using.Version 1 is the time based plus MAC address UUID. The 128-bits contains 48-bits for the network card\'s MAC address (which is uniquely assigned by the manufacturer) and a 60-bit clock with a resolution of 100 nanoseconds. That clock wraps in 3603 A.D. so these UUIDs are safe at least until then (unless you need more than 10 million new UUIDs per second or someone clones your network card). I say "at least" because the clock starts at 15 October 1582, so you have about 400 years after the clock wraps before there is even a small possibility of duplications.Version 4 is the random number UUID. There\'s six fixed bits and the rest of the UUID is 122-bits of randomness. See Wikipedia or other analysis that describe how very unlikely a duplicate is.Version 3 is uses MD5 and Version 5 uses SHA-1 to create those 122-bits, instead of a random or pseudo-random number generator. So in terms of safety it is like Version 4 being a statistical issue (as long as you make sure what the digest algorithm is processing is always unique).Version 2 is similar to Version 1, but with a smaller clock so it is going to wrap around much sooner. But since Version 2 UUIDs are for DCE, you shouldn\'t be using these.So for all practical problems they are safe.  If you are uncomfortable with leaving it up to probabilities (e.g. your are the type of person worried about the earth getting destroyed by a large asteroid in your lifetime), just make sure you use a Version 1 UUID and it is guaranteed to be unique (in your lifetime, unless you plan to live past 3603 A.D.).So why doesn\'t everyone simply use Version 1 UUIDs? That is because Version 1 UUIDs reveal the MAC address of the machine it was generated on and they can be predictable -- two things which might have security implications for the application using those UUIDs.The answer to this may depend largely on the UUID version.Many UUID generators use a version 4 random number.  However, many of these use Pseudo a Random Number Generator to generate them.If a poorly seeded PRNG with a small period is used to generate the UUID I would say it\'s not very safe at all.Therefore, it\'s only as safe as the algorithms used to generate it.On the flip side, if you know the answer to these questions then I think a version 4 uuid should be very safe to use.  In fact I\'m using it to identify blocks on a network block file system and so far have not had a clash.  In my case, the PRNG I\'m using is a mersenne twister and I\'m being careful with the way it\'s seeded which is from multiple sources including /dev/urandom.  Mersenne twister has a period of 2^19937 \xe2\x88\x92 1.  It\'s going to be a very very long time before I see a repeat uuid.Quoting from Wikipedia:Thus, anyone can create a UUID and use\n  it to identify something with\n  reasonable confidence that the\n  identifier will never be\n  unintentionally used by anyone for\n  anything elseIt goes on to explain in pretty good detail on how safe it actually is. So to answer your question: Yes, it\'s safe enough.UUID schemes generally use not only a pseudo-random element, but also the current system time, and some sort of often-unique hardware ID if available, such as a network MAC address.The whole point of using UUID is that you trust it to do a better job of providing a unique ID than you yourself would be able to do.  This is the same rationale behind using a 3rd party cryptography library rather than rolling your own.  Doing it yourself may be more fun, but it\'s typically less responsible to do so.Been doing it for years. Never run into a problem. I usually set up my DB\'s to have one table that contains all the keys and the modified dates and such. Haven\'t run into a problem of duplicate keys ever.The only drawback that it has is when you are writing some queries to find some information quickly you are doing a lot of copying and pasting of the keys. You don\'t have the short easy to remember ids anymore.Here\'s a testing snippet for you to test it\'s uniquenes.\ninspired by @scalabl3\'s comment Funny thing is, you could generate 2 in a row that were identical, of course at mind-boggling levels of coincidence, luck and divine intervention, yet despite the unfathomable odds, it\'s still possible! :D Yes, it won\'t happen. just saying for the amusement of thinking about that moment when you created a duplicate! Screenshot video! \xe2\x80\x93 scalabl3 Oct 20 \'15 at 19:11 If you feel lucky, check the checkbox, it only checks the currently generated id\'s. If you wish a history check, leave it unchecked.\nPlease note, you might run out of ram at some point if you leave it unchecked. I tried to make it cpu friendly so you can abort quickly when needed, just hit the run snippet button again or leave the page.I don\'t know if this matters to you, but keep in mind that GUIDs are globally unique, but substrings of GUIDs aren\'t.
