I used the following line to convert float to int, but it\'s not as accurate as I\'d like:The result is : 8 (It should be 9)When a = -7.65f, the result is : -7 (It should be -8)What\'s the best way to do it ?Using Math.round() will round the float to the nearest integer.Actually, there are different ways to downcast float to int, depending on the result you want to achieve:\n(for int i, float f)round (the closest integer to given float)note: this is, by contract, equal to (int) Math.floor(f + 0.5f)truncate (i.e. drop everything after the decimal dot)ceil/floor (an integer always bigger/smaller than a given value if it has any fractional part)For rounding positive values, you can also just use (int)(f + 0.5), which works exactly as Math.Round in those cases (as per doc).In theory you could use Math.rint(f) to do the rounding, but rint does not round 0.5 up, it rounds it up or down, whichever of the lower or higher integer is even, so it\'s useless in most cases.Seehttp://mindprod.com/jgloss/round.htmlhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.htmlfor more information and some examples.Math.round(value) round the value to the nearest whole number.Use Use Math.round(value) then after type cast it to integer.Math.round also returns an integer value, so you don\'t need to typecast.
