In SQL Server 2005 I have a table cm_production that lists all the code that\'s been put into production. The table has a ticket_number, program_type, and program_name and push_number along with some other columns. GOAL: Count all the DISTINCT program names by program type and push numberWhat I have so far is:This gets me partway there, but it\'s counting all the program names, not the distinct ones (which I don\'t expect it to do in that query). I guess I just can\'t wrap my head around how to tell it to count only the distinct program names without selecting them. Or something. Count all the DISTINCT program names\n  by program type and push numberDISTINCT COUNT(*) will return a row for each unique count. What you want is COUNT(DISTINCT expression): evaluates expression for each row in a group and returns the number of unique, nonnull values.I needed to get the number of occurrences of each distinct value. The column contained Region info.\nThe simple SQL query I ended up with was:Which would give me a list like, say:try this:You have to create a temp table for the distinct columns and then query the count from that table here dt is a temp table This is a good example where you want to get count of Pincode which stored in the last of address field
