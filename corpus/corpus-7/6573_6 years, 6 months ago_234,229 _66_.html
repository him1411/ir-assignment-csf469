I need to sort JavaScript objects by key. Hence the following:Would become:JavaScript objects1 are not ordered. It is meaningless to try to "sort" them. If you want to iterate over an object\'s properties, you can sort the keys and then retrieve the associated values:Alternate implementation using Object.keys fanciness:1Not to be pedantic, but there\'s no such thing as a JSON object.The other answers to this question are outdated, never matched implementation reality, and have officially become incorrect now that the ES6/ES2015 spec has been published.See the section on property iteration order in Exploring ES6 by Axel Rauschmayer:All methods that iterate over property keys do so in the same order:So yes, JavaScript objects are in fact ordered, and the order of their keys/properties can be changed.Here\xe2\x80\x99s how you can sort an object by its keys/properties, alphabetically:Use var instead of const for compatibility with ES5 engines.A lot of people have mention that "objects cannot be sorted", but after that they are giving you a solution which works. Paradox, isn\'t it?No one mention why those solutions are working. They are, because in most of the browser\'s implementations values in objects are stored in the order in which they were added. That\'s why if you create new object from sorted list of keys it\'s returning an expected result.And I think that we could add one more solution \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0ES5 functional way:ES2015 version of above (formatted to "one-liner"):Short explanation of above examples (as asked in comments):Object.keys is giving us a list of keys in provided object (obj or o), then we\'re sorting those using default sorting algorithm, next .reduce is used to convert that array back into an object, but this time with all of the keys sorted.This works for meUsing lodash this will work:Just food for thought.This is an old question, but taking the cue from Mathias Bynens\' answer, I\'ve made a short version to sort the current object, without much overhead.after the code execution, the "unordered" object itself will have the keys alphabetically sorted.Suppose it could be useful in VisualStudio debugger which shows unordered object properties.Underscore version:If you don\'t trust your browser for keeping the order of the keys, I strongly suggest to rely on a ordered array of key-value paired arrays.As already mentioned, objects are unordered.However...You may find this idiom useful:You can then iterate through kv and do whatever you wish.Maybe a bit more elegant form:Here is a clean lodash-based version that works with nested objectsIt would be even cleaner if lodash had a toObject() method...Very good example of sorting object keys here: Iterate over a Javascript associative array in sorted orderUse this code if you have nested objects or if you have nested array obj.Solution:Explanation:Many JavaScript runtimes store values inside an object in the order in which they are added. To sort the properties of an object by their keys you can make use of the Object.keys function which will return an array of keys. The array of keys can then be sorted by the Array.prototype.sort() method which sorts the elements of an array in place (no need to assign them to a new variable).Once the keys are sorted you can start using them one-by-one to access the contents of the old object to fill a new object (which is now sorted).Below is an example of the procedure (you can test it in your targeted browsers):Note: Object.keys is an ECMAScript 5.1 method but here is a polyfill for older browsers:I transfered some Java enums to javascript objects. These objects returned correct arrays for me. if object keys are mixed type (string, int, char), there is a problem. Simple and readable snippet, using lodash.You need to put the key in quotes only when calling sortBy. It doesn\'t have to be in quotes in the data itself.Also, your second parameter to map is wrong. It should be a function, but using pluck is easier.Just use lodash to unzip map and sortBy first value of pair and zip again it will return sorted key.If you want sortby value change pair index to 1 instead of 0Pure JavaScript answer to sort an Object.  This is the only answer that I know of that will handle negative numbers.  This function is for sorting numerical Objects.  Input\n    obj = {1000: {}, -1200: {}, 10000: {}, 200: {}};The output will be an object sorted by those numbers with new keys starting at 0.There\'s a great project by @sindresorhus called sort-keys that works awesome.You can check its source code here:https://github.com/sindresorhus/sort-keysOr you can use it with npm:Here are also code examples from his readmerecursive sort, for nested object and arraysJust to simplify it and make it more clear the answer from Matt Ball
