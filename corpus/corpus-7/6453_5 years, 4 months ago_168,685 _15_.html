I have a list of tuples that looks something like this:I want to sort this list in ascending order by the integer value inside the tuples. Is it possible?Try using the key keyword with sorted().key should be a function that identifies how to retrieve the comparable element from your data structure.  In your case, it is the second element of the tuple, so we access [1].For optimization, see jamylak\'s response using itemgetter(1), which is essentially a faster version of lambda x: x[1].IMO using itemgetter is more readable in this case than the solution by @cheeken. It is\nalso faster since almost all of the computation will be done on the c side (no pun intended) rather than through the use of lambda.  As a python neophyte, I just wanted to mention that if the data did actually look like this: then sorted() would automatically sort by the second element in the tuple, as the first elements are all identical.Adding to Cheeken\'s answer,\nThis is how you sort a list of tuples by the 2nd item in descending order.From python wiki:For a lambda-avoiding method, first define your own function:then:For Python 2.7+, this works which makes the accepted answer slightly more readable:For an in-place sort, useThe fact that the sort values in the OP are integers isn\'t relevant to the question per se. In other words, the accepted answer would work if the sort value was text. I bring this up to also point out that the sort can be modified during the sort (for example, to account for upper and lower case).
