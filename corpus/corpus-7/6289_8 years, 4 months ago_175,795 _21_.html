How do I find the local path on windows in a command prompt?this prints it in the consoleor paste this command in CMD, then you\'ll have pwd:It is cd for "current directory".Open notepad as administrator and write:Save it in c:\\windows\\system32\\\nwith the name "pwd.cmd" (be careful not to save pwd.cmd.txt)Then you have the pwd command.cd ,it will give current directorycd without any parameters is equivalent to pwd on Unix/Linux.From the console output of typing cd /?:hmm - pwd works for me on Vista...Final EDIT: it works for me on Vista because WinAvr installed pwd.exe and added \\Program Files\\WinAvr\\Utils\\bin to my path.chdir or cd provides the current working directorydir | find "Directory"C:\\Documents and Settings\\Scripter>echo %cd%\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\ScripterC:\\Documents and Settings\\Scripter>for unix use pwd commandCurrent working directoryYou can simply put "." the dot sign. I\'ve had a cmd application that was requiring the path and I was already in the needed directory and I used the dot symbol.Hope it helps.
