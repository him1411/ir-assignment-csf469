Possible Duplicate:\n  Why are there sometimes meaningless do/while and if/else statements in C/C++ macros? I\'ve been seeing that expression for over 10 years now. I\'ve been trying to think what it\'s good for. Since I see it mostly in #defines, I assume it\'s good for inner scope variable declaration and for using breaks (instead of gotos.)Is it good for anything else? Do you use it?It\'s the only construct in C that you can use to #define a multistatement operation, put a semicolon after, and still use within an if statement. An example might help:Even using braces doesn\'t help:Using this in an if statement would require that you omit the semicolon, which is counterintuitive:If you define FOO like this:then the following is syntactically correct:It is a way to simplify error checking and avoid deep nested if\'s.  For example:It helps grouping multiple statements into a single one, so that a function-like macro can actually be used as a function. Suppose you haveand you dothen this expands toNotice that the second call (bar(n)) is not part of the if statement anymore.Wrap both into do{}while(0), and you can also use the macro in an if statement.It is interesting to note the following situation where the do {} while (0) loop won\'t work for you:If you want a function-like macro that returns a value, then you will need a statement expression: ({stmt; stmt;}) instead of do {} while(0):Generically, do/while is good for any sort of loop construct where one must execute the loop at least once.  It is possible to emulate this sort of looping through either a straight while or even a for loop, but often the result is a little less elegant.  I\'ll admit that specific applications of this pattern are fairly rare, but they do exist.  One which springs to mind is a menu-based console application:
