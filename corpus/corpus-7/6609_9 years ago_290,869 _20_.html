How do I get my C# program to sleep for 50 milliseconds?This might seem an easy question, but I\'m having a temporary brain failure moment!Remember though, that doing this in the main GUI thread will block your GUI from updating (it will feel "sluggish")Just remove the ; to make it work for VB.net as well.There are basically 3 choices for waiting in (almost) any programming language:for 1. - Loose waiting in C#:However, windows thread scheduler causes acccuracy of Sleep() to be around 15ms (so Sleep can easily wait for 20ms, even if scheduled to wait just for 1ms).for 2. - Tight waiting in C# is:We could also use DateTime.Now or other means of time measurement, but Stopwatch is much faster (and this would really become visible in tight loop).for 3. - Combination:This code regularly blocks thread for 1ms (or slightly more, depending on OS thread scheduling), so processor is not busy for that time of blocking and code does not consume 100% of processor\'s power. Other processing can still be performed in-between blocking (such as: updating of UI, handling of events or doing interaction/communication stuff).You can\'t specify an exact sleep time in Windows.  You need a real-time OS for that.  The best you can do is specify a minimum sleep time.  Then it\'s up to the scheduler to wake up your thread after that.  And never call .Sleep() on the GUI thread.Since now you have async/await feature, the best way to sleep for 50ms is by using Task.Delay:Or if you are targeting .NET 4 (with Async CTP 3 for VS2010 or Microsoft.Bcl.Async), you must use:This way you won\'t block UI thread.Use this codeThe thread will not be scheduled for execution by the operating system for the amount of time specified. This method changes the state of the thread to include WaitSleepJoin.This method does not perform standard COM and SendMessage pumping. \nIf you need to sleep on a thread that has STAThreadAttribute, but you want to perform standard COM and SendMessage pumping, consider using one of the overloads of the Join method that specifies a timeout interval. For readability:Best of both worlds:
