I would like to see the structure of object in JavaScript (for debugging). Is there anything similar to var_dump in PHP?Most modern browsers have a console in their developer tools, useful for this sort of debugging.Then you will get a nicely mapped out interface of the object/whatever in the console.Check out the console documentation for more details.Most common way:However I must mention JSON.stringify which is useful to dump variables in non-browser scripts:The JSON.stringify function also supports built-in prettification as pointed out by Simon Zyx.Example:The above snippet will print:On caniuse.com you can view the browsers that support natively the JSON.stringify function: http://caniuse.com/jsonYou can also use the Douglas Crockford library to add JSON.stringify support on old browsers: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-jsDocs for JSON.stringify: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringifyI hope this helps :-)I wrote this JS function dump() to work like PHP\'s var_dump(). \nTo show the contents of the variable in an alert window: dump(variable)\nTo show the contents of the variable in the web page: dump(variable, \'body\')\nTo just get a string of the variable: dump(variable, \'none\')The var_dump equivalent in JavaScript? Simply, there isn\'t one.But, that doesn\'t mean you\'re left helpless. Like some have suggested, use Firebug (or equivalent in other browsers), but unlike what others suggested, don\'t use console.log when you have a (slightly) better tool console.dir:Prints an interactive listing of all properties of the object. This\n  looks identical to the view that you would see in the DOM tab.As others have already mentioned, the best way to debug your variables is to use a modern browser\'s developer console (e.g. Chrome Developer Tools, Firefox+Firebug, Opera Dragonfly (which now disappeared in the new Chromium-based (Blink) Opera, but as developers say, "Dragonfly is not dead though we cannot give you more information yet").But in case you need another approach, there\'s a really useful site called \nphp.js:http://phpjs.org/ which provides "JavaScript alternatives to PHP functions" - so you can use them the similar way as you would in PHP. I will copy-paste the appropriate functions to you here, BUT be aware that these codes can get updated on the original site in case some bugs are detected, so I suggest you visiting the phpjs.org site! (Btw. I\'m NOT affiliated with the site, but I find it extremely useful.)Here is the code of the JS-alternative of var_dump():\nhttp://phpjs.org/functions/var_dump/\nit depends on the echo() function: http://phpjs.org/functions/echo/Here is the print_r() function:\nhttp://phpjs.org/functions/print_r/\nIt depends on echo() too.You may also find the var_export() alternative useful, which also depends on echo():\nhttp://phpjs.org/functions/var_export/http://phpjs.org/functions/echo/Firebug.Then, in your javascript:Now you can look at the console, click on the statement and see what is inside blahA nice simple solution for parsing a JSON Response to HTML.I made a simple dump function in js, try this https://github.com/resoftw/redumpYou could also try this function. Can\'t remember the original author, but all credits goes to him/her. Works like a charm - 100% the same as var_dump in PHP.Check it out.
