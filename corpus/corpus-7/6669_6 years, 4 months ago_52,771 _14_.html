After running coverage reports in Eclipse (using cobertura or an EMMA plugin), my source code files get highlighted in green, red and yellow depending on which lines of code were covered by tests.How can I clear this highlighting after I\'m done?Click the "Remove all Sessions" button in the toolbar of the "Coverage" view.On 4.2 eclipse it seems to be impossible to remove the eCobertura highlights. Sadly eCobertura plugins seems to be not maintained anymore. However if you start writing into the class, its gone. So type a space, and then undo, and its gone.I found a workaround over on GitHub: https://github.com/jmhofer/eCobertura/issues/8For those who don\'t want to click the link, here\'s the text of the comment:Good workaround:\n  Create a run configuration with a filter, that excludes everything ("*") and let it run just a single test. Name it "Undo coverage".I did this and it worked quite well in Eclipse Juno.Credit for this goes to UsulSK.For those using Cobertura and only have the Coverage Session View like I do,just try closing Eclipse and starting it up again. This got rid of the highlighting for me.If you remove the coverage session, also the coverage coloring will disappear. For this, hit Remove Session or Remove All Sessions in the Coverage view\'s toolbar.http://eclemma.org/faq.htmlAdded shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X C to Keybindings (Window -> Preferences -> filter for Keys) when \'Editing Java Source\' for \'Remove Active Session\'.
