What is the difference between Service Provider Interface (SPI) and Application Programming Interface (API)?More specifically, for Java libraries, what makes them an API and/or SPI?Put differently, the API tells you what a specific class/method does for you and the SPI tells you what you must do to conform.Usually API and SPI are separate. For example in JDBC the Driver class is part of the SPI: If you simply want to use JDBC, you don\'t need to use it directly, but everyone who implements a JDBC driver must implement that class.Sometimes they overlap, however. The Connection interface is both SPI and API: You use it routinely when you use a JDBC driver and it needs to be implemented by the developer of the JDBC driver.From Effective Java 2nd Edition:A service provider framework is a\n  system in which multiple service\n  providers implement a service, and the\n  system makes the implementations\n  available to its clients, decoupling\n  them from the implementations.There are three essential components\n  of a service provider framework: a\n  service interface, which providers\n  implement; a provider registration\n  API, which the system uses to register\n  implementations, giving clients access\n  to them; and a service access API,\n  which clients use to obtain an\n  instance of the service. The service\n  access API typically allows but does\n  not require the client to specify some\n  criteria for choosing a provider. In\n  the absence of such a specification,\n  the API returns an instance of a\n  default implementation. The service\n  access API is the \xe2\x80\x9cflexible static\n  factory\xe2\x80\x9d that forms the basis of the\n  service provider framework.An optional fourth component of a\n  service provider framework is a\n  service provider interface, which\n  providers implement to create\n  instances of their service\n  implementation. In the absence of a\n  service provider interface,\n  implementations are registered by\n  class name and instantiated\n  reflectively (Item 53). In the case of\n  JDBC, Connection plays the part of the\n  service interface,\n  DriverManager.registerDriver is the\n  provider registration API,\n  DriverManager.getConnection is the\n  service access API, and Driver is the\n  service provider interface.There are numerous variants of the\n  service provider framework pattern.\n  For example, the service access API\n  can return a richer service interface\n  than the one required of the provider,\n  using the Adapter pattern [Gamma95, p.\n  139]. Here is a simple implementation\n  with a service provider interface and\n  a default provider:The difference between API and SPI comes when API additionally provides some concrete implementations. In that case, service provider has to implement few APIs(called SPI)An example is JNDI:JNDI provides interfaces & some classes for context lookup. The default way to lookup a context is provided in IntialContext. This class internally will use SPI interfaces (using NamingManager) for provider specific implementations.See the JNDI Architecture below for better understanding.API stands for Application Programming Interface, where API is a means for accessing a service / function provided by some kind of software or a platform.SPI stands for Service Provider Interface, where SPI is way to inject, extend or alter the behavior for software or a platform.API is normally target for clients to access a service and it has the following properties:-->API is a programmatic way of accessing a service to achieve a certain behavior or output-->From API evolution point of view, addition is no problem at all for clients-->But API\'s once utilized by clients it can not (and should not) be altered / deleted\n   unless there are an appropriate communications, since its a complete degradation of the\n   client expectationSPI on the other part are targeted for providers and has the following properties:-->SPI is a way to extend / alter the behavior of a software or a platform (programmable vs.\n   programmatic)-->SPI evolution is different from API evolution, in SPI removal is not an issue-->Addition of SPI interfaces will cause problems and may break existing implementationsFor more explanation click here : Service Provider InterfaceNetBeans\' FAQ: What is an SPI? How is it different from an API?API is a general term - an acronym for Application Programming Interface - it means something (in Java, usually some Java classes) a piece of software exposes, which allows other software to communicate with it.SPI stands for Service Provider Interface. It is a subset of all things that can be API specific to situations where a library is providing classes which are called by the application (or API library), and which typically change the things the application is able to do.The classic example is JavaMail. Its API has two sides:Users of the API rarely need to see or talk to the SPI classes, and vice-versa.In NetBeans, when you see the term SPI, it is usually talking about classes that a module can inject at runtime which allow NetBeans to do new things. For example, there is a general SPI for implementing version control systems. Different modules provide implementations of that SPI for CVS, Subversion, Mercurial and other revision control systems. However, the code that deals with files (the API side) does not need to care if there is a version control system, or what it is. Service provider interface is the service interface which all providers must implement. If none of the existing provider implementations work for you, you need to write your own service provider (implementing the service interface) and register somewhere (see the useful post by Roman).If you\'re reusing the existing provider implementation of the service interface, you\'re basically using the API of that particular provider, which include all the methods of service interface plus a few public methods of its own. If you\'re using methods of provider API outside the SPI, you\'re using provider specific features.I suppose an SPI slots into a larger system by implementing certain features of an API, and then registering itself as being available via service lookup mechanisms. An API is used by the end-user application code directly, but may integrate SPI components. It\'s the difference between encapsulation and direct usage.In the Java world, different technologies are meant to be modular and "pluggable" into an application server. There is then a difference betweenTwo examples of such technologies are JTA (the transaction manager) and JCA (adapter for JMS or database). But there are others.Implementer of such a pluggable technology must then implement the SPI to be pluggable in the app. server and provide an API to be used by the end-user application. An example from JCA is the ManagedConnection interface which is part of the SPI, and the Connection that is part of the end-user API.
