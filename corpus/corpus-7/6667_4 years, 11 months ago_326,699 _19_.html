I would like to use cURL to not only send data parameters in HTTP POST but to also upload files with specific form name. How should I go about doing that ?HTTP Post parameters:userid = 12345\nfilecomment = This is an image fileHTTP File upload:\nFile location = /home/user1/Desktop/test.jpg\nForm name for file = image (correspond to the $_FILES[\'image\'] at the PHP side)I figured part of the cURL command as follows:The problem I am getting is as follows:The problem is I am using $_FILES[\'image\'] to pick up files in the PHP script.How do I adjust my cURL commands accordingly ?You need to use the -F option:\n-F/--form <name=content> Specify HTTP multipart POST data (H)Try this:Catching the user id as path variable (recommended):Catching the user id as part of the form:Here is my solution, I have been reading a lot of posts and they were really helpful. Finally I wrote some code for small files, with cURL and PHP that I think its really useful.With this we should be get on the "api.endpoint.post" the following vars posted. You can easily test with this script, and you should be receive this debugs on the function postFile() at the last row.It should work well, they may be better solutions but this works and is really helpful to understand how the Boundary and multipart/from-data mime works on PHP and cURL library.Here is how to correctly escape arbitrary filenames of uploaded files with bash:The official Vimeo PHP library provides a command line uploader that uses a significantly more stable uploading workflow.The file is here: https://github.com/vimeo/vimeo.php/blob/master/example/upload.php and requires you to create a config.json file similar to this: https://github.com/vimeo/vimeo.php/blob/master/example/config.json.example with your access token.Once set up, you can upload a video with php upload.php ~/video.mp4
