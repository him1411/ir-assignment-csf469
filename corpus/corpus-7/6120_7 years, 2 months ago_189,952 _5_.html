How to convert a ruby hash object to JSON? So I am trying this example below & it doesn\'t work?I was looking at the RubyDoc and obviously Hash object doesn\'t have a to_json method. But I am reading on blogs that Rails supports active_record.to_json and also supports hash#to_json. I can understand ActiveRecord is a Rails object, but Hash is not native to Rails, it\'s a pure Ruby object. So in Rails you can do a hash.to_json, but not in pure Ruby??One of the numerous niceties of Ruby is the possibility to extend existing classes with your own methods. That\'s called "class reopening" or monkey-patching (the meaning of the latter can vary, though).So, take a look here:As you can see, requiring json has magically brought method to_json to our Hash.
