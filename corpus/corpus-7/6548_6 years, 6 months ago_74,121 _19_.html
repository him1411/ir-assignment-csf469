Currently I am working on a python project that contains sub modules and uses numpy/scipy. Ipython is used as interactive console. Unfortunately I am not very happy with workflow that I am using right now, I would appreciate some advice.In IPython, the framework is loaded by a simple import command. However, it is often necessary to change code in one of the submodules of the framework. At this point a model is already loaded and I use IPython to interact with it. Now, the framework contains many modules that depend on each other, i.e. when the framework is initially loaded the main module is importing and configuring the submodules.  The changes to the code are only executed if the module is reloaded using reload(main_mod.sub_mod). This is cumbersome as I need to reload all changed modules individually using the full path. It would be very convenient if reload(main_module) would also reload all sub modules, but without reloading numpy/scipy..IPython comes with some automatic reloading magic:It will reload all changed modules every time before executing a new line. The way this works is slightly different than dreload. Some caveats apply, type %autoreload? to see what can go wrong.If you want to always enable this settings, modify your IPython configuration file ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py[1] and appending:Credit to @Kos via a comment below.[1]\nIf you don\'t have the file ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py, you need to call ipython profile create first. Or the file may be located at $IPYTHONDIR.In IPython 0.12 (and possibly earlier), you can use this:This is essentially the same as the answer by pv., except that the extension has been renamed and is now loaded using %load_ext.IPython offers dreload() to recursively reload all submodules.  Personally, I prefer to use the %run() magic command (though it does not perform a deep reload, as pointed out by John Salvatier in the comments).For some reason, neither %autoreload, nor dreload seem to work for the situation when you import code from one notebook to another. Only plain Python reload works:Based on [1].How about this:This should effectively reload the entire tree of modules and submodules you give it. You can also put this function in your .ipythonrc (I think) so it is loaded every time you start the interpreter.Another option:Verified on ipython and ipython3 v5.1.0 on Ubuntu 14.04.Running a script in IPython3 did not reload modules when using the %autoreload magic whatever.The following worked for me:
