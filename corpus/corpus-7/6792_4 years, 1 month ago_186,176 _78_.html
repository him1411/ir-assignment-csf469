I keep getting this error during the build of my VS2012 C# projectNow I\'ve figured out that killing the processworks (sometimes ) but this is getting on my nerves. Any way to stop this happening at all?My debugger settings are\nI encountered the error message(s) in VS 2013.\nMostly it occured when the debug proces was stopped somewhere in an exception.\nWhen clean+build has no effect, closing VS, deleting \'bin\' and \'obj\' folders en openening VS again has till now always resolved the issue.The bug exists since VS2003.\nAlso: renaming the file is often possible and then you can delete it.In Visual Studio Premium 2013 (Update 3), I solved this with a pre-build one-liner:This gracefully deletes any old PDB files (if it can), then renames anything that\'s left with a .old.pdb extension.  A nice side effect is that if the old PDB is still locked, it just adds another .old piece to the filename, and they all get cleaned up next time you restart Visual Studio and do a build.  For example, build/debug session 1 leaves MyProject.pdb locked.\nThe next time you build:\nMyProject.pdb --> MyProject.old.pdb Then, build/debug session 2 is started, and both MyProject.pdb and MyProject.old.pdb are still locked:\nMyProject.old.pdb --> MyProject.old.old.pdb\nMyProject.pdb --> MyProject.old.pdb Finally, restarting Visual Studio and doing a fresh build will get rid of both of these, and continue the process as usual.It\'s because you have closed your application, but it\'s still running in background.Temporary solution:Permanent solution: you have to close your application through coding. Here is the code...You have to put this code in to the form\'s closing event in all form. Example:the .vhost.exe is a debugger process, so it appears that the process being debugged hasn\'t closed properly. Chances are you have a bug that\'s keeping it alive and are not stopping the debug process correctly - there are options to detach from the process when you click \'stop debugging\' instead of actually killing the debugger so maybe you have that set.But that\'s the problem - the file you\'re trying to copy over is locked (ie still being used) by the OS so its preventing the copy. Ensure that file is free and you\'ll be able to copy.You should disable your antivirus (especailly if it is an Avast) and try again. It helped me. The problem is that the debugger/builder creates the .exe file that is identified as a threat by Avast and therefor deleted right before it could be executed by VS.I have solved it by killing IISExpress in task managerI was able to fix this issue (VS 2010) through supplying following pre build action;Killing the process w3wp.exe (IIS) will often solve this. Generally, you can know the process that has the lock on the file by navigating to the bin folder and trying to delete it. The error message that will pop up, in case another process is using it, will contain the name of the process that needs to be killed. Quote:A workaround is to put this in the Pre-build event command  line property of the >project  (In the build  Events tab):Code SnippetI faced the same problem on VS 2012 Version 11.0.60610.01 Update 3 on Windows 8There were no designer windows open and the project was a simple console application.The removal of the vshost process accessing the file does not work most of the time since the process isn\'t accessing the file.The simplest workaround that works and takes the least amount of time is to remove the project from the solution, build another project in the solution and then add the original back. It\'s an irritant and waste of time but it\'s the least expensive of all the other options that I know of.Hope this helps...Add in pre-build event of your master project taskkill /f /fi "pid gt 0" /im "YourProcess.vshost.exe"In some cases in Visual Studio when you (Build || Rebuild) on top of\nrunning IISExpress you faced with this Exception:Unable to copy file "obj\\Debug\\YourProjectName.dll" to bin\\YourProjectName.dll". the process cannot access the file\n  \'bin\\YourProjectName.dll\' because it is being used by another\n  processYou are good 2 GO!It seems that by change the assembly name of a project fixes the problem.So instead of thisI change it to thisNotice that I just changed it from Increment and Recall to Increment_Recall, I just removed the spaces. It is now working fine to me.Solution: Restart OS, it always works for me, due to vshost process cannot be ended sometimes.This bug also exists in VS series versions including VS2013.You can refer to the link: http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/533411I cannot give a solution to prevent this from happening but you can at least RENAME the locked file (windows explorer, or classic command window) and then compile/build. No need to reboot or restart VS201x. With some experience you can add a pre-build script to delete old files or rename then out-of-the-way in case there\'s a lock.See this other answer. Basically, you could have MSBuild.exe processes running in the background consuming resource files. If you have any pre or post build tasks that cause an MSBuild to be kicked off via command line, try adding the "/nr:false" flag to this command. But again, see the previous answer for more specific details.@Geoff\'s (https://stackoverflow.com/a/25251766/3739540) answer is good, but it throws error code 1 on recompile.Here is what worked for me (2>nul 1>nul on the end + exit 0):I think I solved it removing the check mark to Break all processes when one process breaks in Debug options (op\'s first screenshot->second option).\nIt\'s been building/running well for a while since I unchecked it.\nI\'m using MySql NET Connector and DevExpress controls in my project. May be one of them was not disposing connections, bindings, etc. well because of this flag beeing activated.  EDITED: definitely it works! No more \'Unable to copy file\' and no more Form designer errors.If you are debugging T4 templates, then this happens all the time. My solution (before MS fixes this) would be just to kill this process:Task Manager --> User --> T4VSHostProcess.exe This process only comes up when you debug a T4 template, not when you run one. I finally how fix it. Why we can\'t continue debug after the first debug because the first debug exe still running. So that, after first debug, you need to go to Task Manager -> Process Tab -> [your project name exe] end the exe process. it works for me :)This question was the first result when looking for the following error:Could not copy the file "..." because it was not found.when building in Visual Studio 2013 (Update 3).Solution: Uninstalling the "Productivity Power Tools" in Visual Studio 2013.https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/533411In my case it was Resharper Unit Tests runner(plus NUnit tests, never had such problem with MsTests). After killing the process, was able to rebuild process, without restarting OS or VS2013I didn\'t realize I still had my debugger attached and was trying to build in the same Visual Studio instance. Once I stopped the debugger I was able to build. Killing the vstest.executionengine.exe process(es) resolves this issue 90% of the time for me.  If that doesn\'t work, then also killing QTAgent32.exe and then deleting the /bin and /obj folders for the project in question works.This is the most irritating part of my work day. :)For me it was the Avast antivirus that wont let visual studio to write/read/execute file. So I had to add Visual studio 2010/2012 folder to antivirus exclusion list. And right after that baam... it works. Make sure u close all instances wcfSvcHost and try again. \nIt worked for me! I have noticed some answers that solved my problem, BUT, just in case anyone is having the same problem I was.  IF YOU ARE RUNNING A CONSOLE APP: BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE. Make sure you have closed out any console windows that may have been opened from a previous build. For instance I was just testing some code in a console application, I didn\'t realize that the console window from one of the previous times I ran my program was open. During that session I was debugging, the window got pushed to the back and I couldn\'t see it. Just saying, this could be your problem, so check to make sure that is not the problem.My 10 cents contribution.I still have this problem occasionally on VS 2015 Update 2.I found that switching compilation target solves the problem.Try this:\nif you are in DEBUG switch to RELEASE and build, then back to DEBUG. The problem is gone.Stefano[Work for me]I get this every time I deploy if I edit a Xaml page on WP8 using VS2012.I need to either not open a Xaml page or use process explorer to kill the process XDesProc.exe.If you are getting this error then I recommend using process explorer to see what is happening (even if it\'s a different problem). Just find the process "WeinGartner.WeinCad.exe" and it should show the process and handle accessing the file (well at least when the killing the vhost file doesn\'t fix the issue).
