Is there a way to pass more data into a callback function in jQuery?I have two functions and I want the callback to the $.post, for example, to pass in both the resulting data of the AJAX call, as well as a few custom argumentsI want to be able to pass in my own parameters to a callback, as well as the result returned from the AJAX call.The solution is the binding of variables through closure.As a more basic example, here is an example function that receives and calls a callback function, as well as an example callback function:This calls the callback and supplies a single argument. Now you want to supply an additional argument, so you wrap the callback in closure.Or, more simply using ES6 Arrow Functions:As for your specific example, I haven\'t used the .post function in jQuery, but a quick scan of the documentation suggests the call back should be a function pointer with the following signature:Therefore I think the solution is as follows:What is happening?In the last line, doSomething(extraStuff) is invoked and the result of that invocation is a function pointer.Because extraStuff is passed as an argument to doSomething it is within scope of the doSomething function.When extraStuff is referenced in the returned anonymous inner function of doSomething it is bound by closure to the outer function\'s extraStuff argument. This is true even after doSomething has returned.I haven\'t tested the above, but I\'ve written very similar code in the last 24 hours and it works as I\'ve described.You can of course pass multiple variables instead of a single \'extraStuff\' object depending on your personal preference/coding standards.When using doSomething(data, myDiv), you actually call the function and do not make a reference to it.You can either pass the doStomething function directly but you must ensure it has the correct signature.If you want to keep doSomething the way it is, you can wrap its call in an anonymous function.Inside the anonymous function code, you can use the variables defined in the enclosing scope. This is the way Javascript scoping works.It\'s actually easier than everyone\'s making it sound... especially if you use the $.ajax({}) base syntax vs. one of the helper functions.Just pass in the key: value pair like you would on any object, when you setup your ajax request... (because $(this) hasn\'t changed context yet, it\'s still the trigger for the bind call above)One of the reasons this is better than setting the var, is that the var is global and as such, overwritable... if you have 2 things which can trigger ajax calls, you could in theory trigger them faster than ajax call responds, and you\'d have the value for the second call passed into the first.  Using this method, above, that wouldn\'t happen (and it\'s pretty simple to use too).In today\'s world there is a another answer that is cleaner, and taken from another Stack Overflow answer:Here\'s the original question and answer:\njQuery HOW TO?? pass additional parameters to success callback for $.ajax call?You can also try something like the following:You can use a closure of JavaScript:and when you can do:I\'ve made a mistake in the last my post. This is working example for how to pass additional argument in callback function:Let\'s go simple ! :)A more general solution for sending asynchronous requests using the .ajax() jQuery API and closures to pass additional parameters to the callback function:For me, and other newbies who has just contacted with Javascript,\nI think that the Closeure Solution is a little kind of too confusing.While I found that, you can easilly pass as many parameters as you want to every ajax callback using jquery.Here are two easier solutions.First one, which @zeroasterisk has mentioned above, example:Second one, pass self-defined-datas by adding them into the XHR object\nwhich exists in the whole ajax-request-response life span.As you can see these two solutions has a drawback that : you need write a little more code every time than just write:Read more about $.ajax : http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/Secondary way :As an addendum to b01\'s answer, the second argument of $.proxy is often used to preserve the this reference. Additional arguments passed to $.proxy are partially applied to the function, pre-filling it with data.  Note that any arguments $.post passes to the callback will be applied at the end, so doSomething should have those at the end of its argument list:This approach also allows multiple arguments to be bound to the callback:If someone still comes here, this is my take:What happens here, after binding to the callback function, it will be available within the function as this.This idea comes from how React uses the bind functionality.actually, your code is not working because when you write:you place a function call as the third parameter rather than a function reference.
