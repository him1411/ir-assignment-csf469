I have String variable called jsonString:Now I want to convert it into JSON Object. I searched more on Google but didn\'t get any expected answers...Using org.json library:To anyone still looking for an answer:You can use google-gson. Details:Object Examples(Serialization)Note that you can not serialize objects with circular references since that will result in infinite recursion.(Deserialization)Another example for Gson:Gson is easy to learn and implement, you need to know is the following two methods:-> toJson() \xe2\x80\x93 convert java object to JSON format-> fromJson() \xe2\x80\x93 convert JSON into java objectOutputResources: Google Gson Project Home Page Gson User GuideExampleThere are various Java JSON serializers and deserializers linked from the JSON home page.As of this writing, there are these 20:...but of course the list can change.Java 7 solution;I like to use google-gson for this, and it\'s precisely because I don\'t need to work with JSONObject directly.In that case I\'d have a class that will correspond to the properties of your JSON ObjectHowever, I think your question is more like, How do I endup with an actual JSONObject object from a JSON String.I was looking at the google-json api and couldn\'t find anything as straight forward as\norg.json\'s api which is probably what you want to be using if you\'re so strongly in need of using a barebones JSONObject.http://www.json.org/javadoc/org/json/JSONObject.htmlWith org.json.JSONObject (another completely different API) If you want to do something like...I think the beauty of google-gson is that you don\'t need to deal with JSONObject. You just grab json, pass the class to want to deserialize into, and your class attributes will be matched to the JSON, but then again, everyone has their own requirements, maybe you can\'t afford the luxury to have pre-mapped classes on the deserializing side because things might be too dynamic on the JSON Generating side. In that case just use json.org.If you are using http://json-lib.sourceforge.net\n(net.sf.json.JSONObject)it is pretty easy:orget the values then with\njson.getString(param), json.getInt(param) and so on.you must import org.jsonUse JsonNode of fasterxml for the Generic Json Parsing. It internally creates a Map of key value for all the inputs.Example: input String :To convert String into JSONObject you just need to pass the String instance into Constructor of JSONObject.Eg:To convert a string to json and the sting is like json. {"phonetype":"N95","cat":"WP"}For setting json single object to list\n iein to List<Location>use jackson.mapper-asl-1.9.7.jarNOTE that GSON with deserializing an interface will result in exception like below.While deserialize; GSON don\'t know which object has to be intantiated for that interface.This is resolved somehow here.However FlexJSON has this solution inherently. while serialize time it is adding class name as part of json like below.So JSON will be cumber some; but you don\'t need write InstanceCreator which is required in GSON.Better Go with more simpler way by using org.json lib. Just do a very simple approach as below:Now obj is your converted JSONObject form of your respective String. This is in case if you have name-value pairs. For a string you can directly pass to the constructor of JSONObject. If it\'ll be a valid json String, then okay otherwise it\'ll throw an exception.
