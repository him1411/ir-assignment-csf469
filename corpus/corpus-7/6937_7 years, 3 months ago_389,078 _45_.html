I have a database that is quite large so I want to export it using Command Prompt but I don\'t know how to.I am using WAMP.First check if your command line recognizes mysql command. If not go to command & type in:Then use this command to export your database:You will then be prompted for the database password.This exports the database to the path you are currently in, while executing this commandNote: Here are some detailed instructions regarding both import and exportSimply use the following command,For Export:For Import:Note: There is no space between the keyword \'-p\' and your password.Well you can use below command,mysqldump --databases --user=root --password your_db_name > export_into_db.sqland the generated file will be available in the same directory where you had ran this command.You could find more on the official reference for mysqldump: Import Export MySQL DB or from thisNote: use --databases instead of --database since the last one is no more supported.Enjoy :)Locate your mysql instance with:If this is correct then export with the following (else navigate to the mysql instance in your mamp folder in bin):And if you wish to zip it at the sametime:You can then move this file between servers with: (where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the server IP address)And then import it with:Go to command prompt at this path,C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.0\\bin>Then give this command to export your database (no space after -p)mysqldump -u[username] -p[userpassword] yourdatabase > [filepath]wantedsqlfile.sqlExample in localhostI have installed my wamp server in D: drive so u have to go to the following path from ur command line->(and if u have installed ur wamp in c: drive then just replace the d: wtih c: here)here root is user of my phpmyadmin\npassword is the password for phpmyadmin so if u haven\'t set any password for root just nothing type at that place,\ndb_name is the database (for which database u r taking the backup)\n,backupfile.sql is the file in which u want ur backup of ur database and u can also change the backup file location(d:\\backupfile.sql) from to any other place on your computerThe answer of Opentuned is great.\nOne small thing is removing the actual password from the command line:This prevents people searching your history for the password.First of all \nopen command prompt then open bin directory in cmd (i hope you\'re aware with cmd commands)\ngo to bin directory of your MySql folder in WAMP program files.run command press enter system will export particular database and create sql file to the given location.i hope you got it :)\nif you have any question please let me know.To export PROCEDUREs, FUNCTIONs & TRIGGERs too, add --routines parameter:mysqldump -u YourUser -p YourDatabaseName --routines > wantedsqlfile.sqlwhere d:\\wamp\\bin\\mysql\\mysql5.6.12\\bin\\mysqldump.exe will be your actual mysqldump.exe path, mydbname is the name of database which you want to export and d:\\mydb.sql is the path where you want to store the exported database.I have used wamp server. I tried onroot is my username for mysql, and if you have any password specify it with:Hope it works.For windows OS : When you get error 1064 mysql (42000) while trying to execute mysqldump command, exit from current terminal. And execute mysqldump command. You can use this script to export or import any database from terminal\ngiven at this link: https://github.com/Ridhwanluthra/mysql_import_export_script/blob/master/mysql_import_export_script.sh
