I\'m migrating from ActionBar to Toolbar in my application. \nBut I don\'t know how to display and set click event on Back Arrow on Toolbar like I did on Actionbar.\nWith ActionBar, I call mActionbar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true).\nBut there is no the similar method like this.Has anyone ever faced this situation and somehow found a way to solve it?If you are using an ActionBarActivity then you can tell Android to use the Toolbar as the ActionBar like so:And then calls to will work. You can also use that in Fragments that are attached to ActionBarActivities you can use it like this:If you are not using ActionBarActivities or if you want to get the back arrow on a Toolbar that\'s not set as your SupportActionBar then you can use the following:If you are using android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar, then you should add the following code to your AppCompatActivity:I see a lot of answers but here is mine which is not mentioned before. It works from API 8+.you can use the tool bar setNavigationIcon method.\nAndroid DocThere are many ways to achieve that, here is my favorite:Layout:Activity:If you were using AppCompatActivity and have gone down the path of not using it, because you wanted to not get the automatic ActionBar that it provides, because you want to separate out the Toolbar, because of your Material Design needs and CoordinatorLayout or AppBarLayout, then, consider this:You can still use the AppCompatActivity, you don\'t need to stop using it just so that you can use a <android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar> in your xml. Just turn off the action bar style as follows:First, derive a style from one of the NoActionBar themes that you like in your styles.xml, I used Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar like so:In your App\'s manifest, choose the child style theme you just defined, like so:In your Activity Xml, if the toolbar is defined like so:Then, and this is the important part, you set the support Action bar to the AppCompatActivity that you\'re extending, so that the toolbar in your xml, becomes the action bar. I feel that this is a better way, because you can simply do the many things that ActionBar allows, like menus, automatic activity title, item selection handling, etc. without resorting to adding custom click handlers, etc.In your Activity\'s onCreate override, do the following:And for API 21+ android:navigationIconI used this method from the Google Developer Documentation:If you get a null pointer exception it could depend on the theme. Try using a different theme in the manifest or use this alternatively:Then in the manifest, where I set the parent activity for current activity:I hope this will help you!This worked perfectlyIf you don\'t want to create a custom Toolbar, you can do like thisIn you AndroidManifest.xmlyou can also put this android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light" to <aplication> tag, for apply to all activities
