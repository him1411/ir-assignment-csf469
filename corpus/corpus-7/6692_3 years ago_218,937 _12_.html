I have two cloned repositories of two very similar open-source projects, which I have been working on in different instances in Sublime Text 2 to arrive at my desired result. Code from both of these projects was used. I have been using Git as version control for my project, but have not included the original projects. Thus, I would like to be able to quickly compare the contents of two files of the original project and compare the differences between them and my project.I was hoping that Sublime Text 2 would have a "Compare File" feature, but I can\'t seem to find anything related to it in the settings or online. A third-party ST2 package to accomplish this task would also work well. Is such a task possible to do within the ST2 text editor? You can actually compare files natively right in Sublime Text.Compare Side-By-Side looks like the most convenient to me though it\'s not the most popular:UPD: I need to add that this plugin can freeze ST while comparing big files. It is certainly not the best decision if you are going to compare large texts.There are a number of diff plugins available via Package Control. I\'ve used Sublimerge Pro, which worked well enough, but it\'s a commercial product (with an unlimited trial period) and closed-source, so you can\'t tweak it if you want to change something, or just look at its internals. FileDiffs is quite popular, judging by the number of installs, so you might want to try that one out. UPDATE (Given the upvotes, I feel there is a need for a complete step-by-step explanation...)There should be a new Tab now showing the comparison.Original short answer:\nNote that:The "Diff files" only appears with the "folders" sidebar (to open a folder: File->Open Folder) , not with "open files" sidebar.
