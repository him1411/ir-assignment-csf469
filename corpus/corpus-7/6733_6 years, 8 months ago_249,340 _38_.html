How do I add a touch event to a UIView?\nI try:I don\'t want to create a subclass and overwriteIn iOS 3.2 and higher, you can use gesture recognizers. For example, this is how you would handle a tap event:There are a bunch of built in gestures as well. Check out the docs for iOS event handling and UIGestureRecognizer. I also have a bunch of sample code up on github that might help.There are a number of commonly used touch events (or gestures) that you can be notified of when you add a Gesture Recognizer to your view. They following gesture types are supported by default:In addition to these, you can also make your own custom gesture recognizer.Drag a gesture recognizer from the object library onto your view.Control drag from the gesture in the Document Outline to your View Controller code in order to make an Outlet and an Action.To add a gesture programmatically, you (1) create a gesture recognizer, (2) add it to a view, and (3) make a method that is called when the gesture is recognized.NotesYou can study the gesture recognizers that I added to these views to see how they work.Here is the code for that project:NotesUpdated for Swift 3I think you can simply use i mean headerView extends from UIControl.Based on the accepted answer you can define a macro:This macro uses ARC, so there\'s no release call.Macro usage example:You can achieve this by adding Gesture Recogniser in your code.Step 1: ViewController.m:Step 2: ViewController.m:NOTE: here yourView in my case was @property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIView *localView;EDIT: *localView is the white box in Main.storyboard from belowHeres a Swift version:Swift 3 UpdateUse Here is ios tapgesture;\nFirst you need to create action for GestureRecognizer after write the below code under the action as shown belowAnother way is adding a transparent button to the viewAnd then, handle click: Create a gesture recognizer (subclass), that will implement touch events, like touchesBegan. You can add it to the view after that.This way you\'ll use composition instead subclassing (which was the request).Swift 3:
