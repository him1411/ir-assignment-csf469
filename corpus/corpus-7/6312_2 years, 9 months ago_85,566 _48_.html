Recently Google introduced a simplified "captcha" verification system (video) that enables users to pass the "captcha" just by clicking on it.But how can it differentiate a bot from a person just by a click?As per this answer, (assuming a similar implementation), at first "recaptcha" generates a hidden key and attaches it to a hidden input element and also lazily renders a check box (not an actual check box input but a div) with the same key which when clicked, sends an asynchronous request (XHR) to the Google backend servers to mark it as a valid verification key (i.e. a key that has to be validated when the form is submitted).But why can\'t bots automate that click (at least, browser-based bots)?How might this work?This is speculation, but based on Google\'s reference to the "risk analysis engine" they use (http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html)I would assume it looks at how you behaved prior to clicking, how your cursor moved on its way to the check (organic path/acceleration), which part of the checkbox was clicked (random places, or dead on center every time), browser fingerprint, Google cookies & contents, click location history tied to your fingerprint or account if it detects one etc. It\'s fairly difficult to fake "organic" behavior in such a way that it would fool a continuously learning pattern detection engine. In the cases where it\'s not sure, it still prompts you to match an actual CAPTCHA string.A new paper has been released with several tests against reCAPTCHA:https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdfSome highlights:Google has already fixed the cookie vulnerability and is probably restricting some behaviors based on IPs.Another interesting finding is that Google runs a VM in JavaScript that obfuscates much of reCAPTCHA code and behavior. This VM is known as botguard and is used to protect other services besides reCAPTCHA:https://github.com/neuroradiology/InsideReCaptchaMy Bots are running well against ReCaptcha.Here my Solution.Let your Bot do this Steps:First write a Human Mouse Move Function to move your Mouse like a B-Spline (Ask me for Source Code).

I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s mouse movements, scrolls, time intervals, keystrokes and stuff like that. Bots are still pretty bad at mimicking your behavior. While the exact technology will not be just handed to the public \xe2\x80\x93 that would be just silly \xe2\x80\x93 there were hints that it relies on tracking user\xe2\x80\x99s behavior prior to and just after the No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA (yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mouthful) challenge. http://codesupport.info/new-google-recaptcha-free-anti-abuse-service-say-im-robot-just-click/May I present my guess, since this is not a open technology.Google says it\'s about combing information from before, during, after to distinguish human from robot. But I am more interested about that final click on the check box.Say, the POST data (solved CAPTCHA) has a field called fingerprint, a string calculated from user behavior. I think there may be a field about that check box location. I guess this check box is in a coordinate system randomly generated by Google back-end and encrypted by the public key of my site. So, a robot may "guess/calculate" a location about this box, but when site owner makes the GET query with private key to verify user identity, Google will decrypt the coordinate system and say if the user click on the right place. So, only one possible right click(with some offsets, it\'s a square box) location in this random coordinate system owned by only Google and site owners.
