What\'s the difference between django OneToOneField and ForeignKey?Be careful to realize that there are some differences between OneToOneField(SomeModel) and ForeignKey(SomeModel, unique=True). As stated in The Definitive Guide to Django:OneToOneFieldA one-to-one relationship. Conceptually, this is similar to a ForeignKey with unique=True, but the "reverse" side of the relation will directly return a single object.In contrast to the OneToOneField "reverse" relation, a ForeignKey "reverse" relation returns a QuerySet.For example, if we have the following two models (full model code below):From within python manage.py shell execute the following:A ForeignKey is for one-to-many, so a Car object might have many Wheels, each Wheel having a ForeignKey to the Car it belongs to. A OneToOneField would be like an Engine, where a Car object can have one and only one.The best and the most effective way to learn new things is to see and study real world practical examples. Suppose for a moment that you want to build a blog in django where reporters can write and publish news articles. The owner of the online newspaper wants to allow each of his reporters to publish as many articles as they want, but does not want different reporters to work on the same article. This means that when readers go and read an article they will se only one author in the article.For example: Article by John, Article by Harry, Article by Rick. You can not have Article by Harry & Rick because the boss does not want two or more authors to work on the same article.How can we solve this \'problem\' with the help of django? The key to the solution of this problem is the django ForeignKey.The following is the full code which can be used to implement the idea of our boss.Run python manage.py syncdb to execute the sql code and build the tables for your app in your database. Then use python manage.py shell to open a python shell.Create the Reporter object R1.Create the Article object A1.Then use the following piece of code to get the name of the reporter.Now create the Reporter object R2 by running the following python code.Now try to add R2 to the Article object A1.It does not work and you will get an AttributeError saying \'Reporter\' object has no attribute \'add\'.As you can see an Article object can not be related to more than one Reporter object.What about R1? Can we attach more than one Article objects to it? This practical example shows us that django ForeignKey is used to define  many-to-one relationships. OneToOneField is used to create one-to-one relationships.We can use reporter = models.OneToOneField(Reporter) in the above models.py file but it is not going to be useful in our example as an author will not be able to post more than one article. Each time you want to post a new article you will have to create a new Reporter object. This is time consuming, isn\'t it?I highly recommend to try the example with the OneToOneField and realize the difference. I am pretty sure that after this example you will completly know the difference between django OneToOneField and django ForeignKey.OneToOneField (one-to-one) realizes, in object orientation, the notion of composition, while ForeignKey (one-to-many) relates to agregation.When you access a OneToOneField you get the value of the field you queried. In this example a book model\'s \'title\' field is a OneToOneField:When you access a ForeignKey you get the related model object, which you can then preform further queries against. In this example the same book model\'s \'publisher\' field is a ForeignKey (correlating to the Publisher class model definition):With ForeignKey fields queries work the other way too, but they\'re slightly different due to the non-symmetrical nature of the relationship. Behind the scenes, book_set is just a QuerySet and can be filtered and sliced like any other QuerySet. The attribute name book_set is generated by appending the lower case model name to _set.Also OneToOneField is useful to be used as primary key to avoid key duplication. One may do not have implicit / explicit autofieldbut use OneToOneField as primary key instead (imagine UserProfile model for example):
