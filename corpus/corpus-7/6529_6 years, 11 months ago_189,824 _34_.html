I have been trying to figure out how to rotate videos with FFmpeg. I am working with iPhone videos taken in portrait mode. I know how to determine the current degrees of rotation using MediaInfo (excellent library, btw) but I\'m stuck on FFmpeg now.From what I\'ve read, what you need to use is a vfilter option. According to what I see, it should look like this:However, I can\'t get this to work. First, -vfilters doesn\'t exist anymore, it\'s now just -vf. Second, I get this error:As far as I know, I have an all-options-on build of FFmpeg. Running ffmpeg -filters shows this:Having the options for vflip and hflip are great and all, but they just won\'t get me where I need to go. I need to the ability to rotate videos 90 degrees at the very least. 270 degrees would be an excellent option to have as well. Where have the rotate options gone?Rotate 90 clockwise:For the transpose parameter you can pass:Use -vf "transpose=2,transpose=2" for 180 degrees.Make sure you use a recent ffmpeg version from here (a static build will work fine).Note that this will re-encode the audio and video parts. You can usually copy the audio without touching it, by using -c:a copy. To change the video quality, set the bitrate (for example with -b:v 1M) or have a look at the H.264 encoding guide if you want VBR options.A solution is also to use this convenience script.Have you tried transpose yet? Like (from the other answer)If you are using an old version, you have to update ffmpeg if you want to use the transpose feature, as it was added in October 2011.The FFmpeg download page offers static builds that you can directly execute without having to compile them.If you don\'t want to re-encode your video AND your player can handle rotation metadata you can just change the rotation in the metadata using ffmpeg:I came across this page while searching for the same answer.  It is now six months since this was originally asked and the builds have been updated many times since then.  However, I wanted to add an answer for anyone else that comes across here looking for this information.I am using Debian Squeeze and FFmpeg version from those repositories.The MAN page for ffmpeg states the following useThe key being that you are not to use a degree variable, but a predefined setting variable from the MAN page.  won\'t work, even with latest source...must change the order:works fineTo rotate the picture clockwise you can use the rotate filter, indicating a positive angle in radians. With 90 degrees equating with PI/2, you can do it like so:for counter-clockwise the angle must be negativeThe transpose filter will work equally well for 90 degrees, but for other angles this is a faster or only choice.If you\'re getting a "Codec is experimental but experimental codecs are not enabled" error use this :Happened with me for some .mov file with aac audio.This script that will output the files with the directory structure under "fixedFiles". At the moment is fixed to MOV files and will execute a number of transformations depending on the original "rotation" of the video. Works with iOS captured videos on a Mac running Mavericks, but should be easily exportable. Relies on having installed both exiftool and ffmpeg.Alexy\'s answer almost worked for me except that I was getting this error:timebase 1/90000 not supported by MPEG 4 standard, the maximum\n  admitted value for the timebase denominator is 65535I just had to add a parameter (-r 65535/2733) to the command and it worked. The full command was thus:Unfortunately, the Ubuntu version of ffmpeg does support videofilters.You need to use avidemux or some other editor to achieve the same effect.In the programmatic way, mencoder has been recommended.
