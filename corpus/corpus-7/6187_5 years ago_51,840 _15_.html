In my Visual Studio 2012 Solution Explorer, when I single click a filename it opens it. This was different from Visual Studio 2010 (required a double click). Is there a way to make double-click the \'view file\' command?This is where you change that behavior (in VS2012, VS 2013 and VS 2015):Use the preview button to toggle it in Solution Explorer:The Single-click opens files in the preview tab text mentioned in rubber boots\' answer is missing in VS 2015. Mysteriously, a search for "single click" still brings up the Environment > Tabs and Windows option.So for VS2015 and VS2017, either click the button in Vinicius\'s answer, or uncheck the Preview selected files in Solution Explorer box shown in the screenshot below.In Visual studio 12/13, easiest way is to type "single click" in quick search  and than select Tabs and Windows.And in Tabs and Windows dialogue ,uncheck "Preview selected files in solutions explorer"Shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Home.If you press that in a document that was just opened, it will be opened permanently.Item -> right click -> Open With -> Source Code (Text) Editor -> press Set as Default button
