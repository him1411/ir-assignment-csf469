I\'ve had a look over here but didn\'t find any details on the best file permissions.  I also took a look at some of WordPress\'s form\'s questions over here too but anybody that suggests 777 obviously needs a little lesson in security.In short my question is this.  What permissions should I have for the following:and then all the files in each of those folders?When you setup WP you (the webserver) may need write access to the files. So the access rights may need to be loose.After the setup you should tighten the access rights, according to Hardening WordPress all files except for wp-content should be writable by your user account only. wp-content must be writable by www-data too.Maybe you want to change the contents in wp-content later on. In this case you couldWhatever you do, make sure the files have rw permissions for www-data.Giving the full access to all wp files to www-data user (which is in this case the web server user) can be dangerous. \nSo rather do NOT do this:It can be useful however in the moment when you\'re installing or upgrading WordPress and its plug-ins. But when you finished it\'s no longer a good idea to keep wp files owned by the web server.It basically allows the web server to put or overwrite any file in your website.\nThis means that there is a possibility to take over your site if someone manage to use the web server (or a security hole in some .php script) to put some files in your website.To protect your site against such an attack you should to the following:All files should be owned by your user account, and should be writable\n  by you. Any file that needs write access from WordPress should be\n  writable by the web server, if your hosting set up requires it, that\n  may mean those files need to be group-owned by the user account used\n  by the web server process.The root WordPress directory: all files should be writable only by your user account, except .htaccess if you want WordPress to\n  automatically generate rewrite rules for you.The WordPress administration area: all files should be writable only by your user account. The bulk of WordPress application logic: all files should be writable only by your user account.  User-supplied content: intended to be writable by your user account and the web server process. Within /wp-content/ you will find:Theme files. If you want to use the built-in theme editor, all files need to be writable by the web server process. If you do not\n  want to use the built-in theme editor, all files can be writable only\n  by your user account.  Plugin files: all files should be writable only by your user account. Other directories that may be present with /wp-content/ should be\n  documented by whichever plugin or theme requires them. Permissions may\n  vary.Source and additional information: http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPressFor those who have their wordpress root folder under their home folder:** Ubuntu/apacheCREDIT Granting write permissions to www-data groupYou want to call usermod on your user. So that would be:** Assuming www-data group existsCheck your user is in www-data group:groups yourUserNameYou should get something like:** youUserGroupName is usually similar to you user nameRecursively change group ownership of the wp-content folder keeping your user ownershipchown yourUserName:www-data -R youWebSiteFolder/wp-content/*Change directory to youWebSiteFolder/wp-content/cd youWebSiteFolder/wp-contentRecursively change group permissions of the folders and sub-folders to enable write permissions:find . -type d -exec chmod -R 775 {} \\;** mode of `/home/yourUserName/youWebSiteFolder/wp-content/\' changed from 0755 (rwxr-xr-x) to 0775 (rwxrwxr-x)Recursively change group permissions of the files and sub-files to enable write permissions:find . -type f -exec chmod -R 664 {} \\;The result should look something like:Equivalent to:chmod -R ug+rw foldernamePermissions will be like 664 for files or 775 for directories.P.s. if anyone encounters error \'could not create directory\' when updating a plugin, do:\nserver@user:~/domainame.com$ sudo chown username:www-data -R wp-content\nwhen you are at the root of your domain.\nAssuming: wp-config.php has\nFTP credentials on LocalHost\ndefine(\'FS_METHOD\',\'direct\');I set permissions to:In my case I created a specific user for WordPress which is different from the apache default user that prevent access from the web to those files owned by that user.Then it gives permission to apache user to handle the upload folder and finally set secure enough file and folder permissions.EDITEDIf you\'re using W3C Total Cache you should do the next also:Then it\'ll work!EDITEDAfter a while developing WordPress sites I\'d recommend different file permissions per environment:In production, I wouldn\'t give access to users to modify the filesystem, I\'ll only allow them to upload resources and give access to some plugins specific folders to do backups, etc. But managing projects under Git and using deploy keys on the server, it isn\'t good update plugins on staging nor production. I leave here the production file setup:www-data:www-data = apache or nginx user and groupStaging will share the same production permissions as it should be a clone of it.Finally, development environment will have access to update plugins, translations, everything...www-data:www-data = apache or nginx user and group\nyour-user:root-group = your current user and the root groupThese permissions will give you access to develop under themes and your-plugin folder without asking permission. The rest of the content will be owned by the Apache or Nginx user to allow WP to manage the filesystem.Before creating a git repo first run these commands:Correct permissions for the file is 644\nCorrect permissions for the folder is 755To change the permissions , use terminal and following commands.755 for folders and 644 for files.I think the below rules are recommended for a default wordpress site:For folders inside wp-content, set 0755 permissions:   chmod -R 0755 plugins chmod -R 0755 uploads chmod -R 0755 upgradeLet apache user be the owner for the above directories of wp-content:chown apache uploadschown apache upgradechown apache pluginsIt actually depends on the plugins you plan to use as some plugins change the root document of the wordpress. but generally I recommend something like this for the wordpress directory.This will assign the "root" (or whatever the user you are using) as the user in every single file/folder, R means recursive, so it just doesn\'t stop at the "html" folder. if you didn\'t use R, then it only applicable to the "html" directory. This will set the owner/group of "wp-content" to "www-data" and thus allowing the web server to install the plugins through the admin panel. This will set the permission of every single file in "html" folder (Including files in subdirectories) to 644, so outside people can\'t execute any file, modify any file, group can\'t execute any file,  modify any file and only the user is allowed to modify/read files, but still even the user can\'t execute any file. This is important because it prevents any kind of execution in "html" folder, also since the owner of the html folder and all other folders except the wp-content folder are "root" (or your user),  the www-data can\'t modify any file outside of the wp-content folder, so even if there is any vulnerability in the web server, and if someone accessed to the site unauthorizedly, they can\'t delete the main site except the plugins. This will restrict the permission of accessing to "wp-config.php" to user/group with rw-r----- these permissions. And if a plugin or update complained it can\'t update, then access to the SSH and use this command, and grant the temporary permission to "www-data" (web server) to update/install through the admin panel, and then revert back to the "root" or your user once it\'s completed. And in Nginx (same procedure for the apache)to protect the wp-admin folder from unauthorized accessing, and probing. apache2-utils is required for encrypting the  password even if you have nginx installed, omit c if you plan to add more users to the same file.Now visit this location Use this codes to protect "wp-admin" folder with a password, now it will ask the password/username if you tried to access to the "wp-admin". notice, here you use the ".htpasswd" file which contains the encrypted password. Now restart the nginx. Commands:Where ftp-user is what user you are using to upload the filesI can\'t tell you whether or not this is correct, but I am using a Bitnami image over Google Compute App Engine. I has having problems with plugins and migration, and after further messing things up by chmod\'ing permissions, I found these three lines which solved all my problems. Not sure if it\'s the proper way but worked for me.For OS X use this command:To absolutely make sure that your website is secure and you are using correct permissions for your folders, use a security plugin like these:https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall/https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/These plugins will scan your Wordpress installation and notify you about any potential issues. These will also warn you about any insecure folder permissions. In addition to that, these plugins will recommend you what permissions should be assigned to the folders.
