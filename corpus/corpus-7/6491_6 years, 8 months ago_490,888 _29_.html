I want to set a option that was selected previously to be displayed on page load. I tried it with the following code:withBut this does not work. Any ideas?This definitely should work. Here\'s a demo. Make sure you have placed your code into a $(document).ready:$(\'#gate\').val(\'Gateway 2\').prop(\'selected\', true);I have found using the jQuery .val() method to have a significant drawback.If this select box (or any other input object) is in a form and there is a reset button used in the form, when the reset button is clicked the set value will get cleared and not reset to the beginning value as you would expect.This seems to work the best for me.For Select boxes For text inputsFor textarea inputsFor checkbox boxesFor radio buttonsThat works fine. See this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/kveAL/It is possible that you need to declare your jQuery in a $(document).ready() handler? Also, might you have two elements that have the same ID?This would be another option:My problemI had the same issue . The Only difference from your code is that I was loading the select box through an ajax call and soon as the ajax call was executed I had set the default value of the select boxThe SolutionI had the same problem. Solution: add a refresh.I had a problem where the value was not set because of a syntax error before the call.Check for syntax errors before the call.Addition to @icksde and @Korah (thx both!)When building the options with AJAX the document.ready may be triggered before the list is built, so This doesn\'t workThis doesA timeout does work but as @icksde says it\'s fragile (I did actually need 20ms in stead of 10ms). It\'s better to fit it inside the AJAX function like this:
