Is it possible to specify a custom thread pool for Java 8 parallel stream? I can not find it anywhere. Imagine that I have a server application and I would like to use parallel streams. But the application is large and multi-threaded so I want to compartmentalize it. I do not want a slow running task in one module of the applicationblock tasks from another module.If I can not use different thread pools for different modules, it means I can not safely use parallel streams in most of real world situations.Try the following example. There are some CPU intensive tasks executed in separate threads.\nThe tasks leverage parallel streams. The first task is broken, so each step takes 1 second (simulated by thread sleep). The issue is that other threads get stuck and wait for the broken task to finish. This is contrived example, but imagine a servlet app and someone submitting a long running task to the shared fork join pool. There actually is a trick how to execute a parallel operation in a specific fork-join pool. If you execute it as a task in a fork-join pool, it stays there and does not use the common one.  The trick is based on ForkJoinTask.fork which specifies: "Arranges to asynchronously execute this task in the pool the current task is running in, if applicable, or using the ForkJoinPool.commonPool() if not inForkJoinPool()"The parallel streams use the default ForkJoinPool which by default has one less threads as you have processors, as returned by Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() (This means that parallel streams use all your processors because they also use the main thread):For applications that require separate or custom pools, a ForkJoinPool may be constructed with a given target parallelism level; by default, equal to the number of available processors.To change the way parallel streams are executed, you can eitherExample of the latter on my machine which has 8 processors. If I run the following program:The output is:215 216 216 216 216 216 216 216 315 316 316 316 316 316 316 316 415 416 416 416So you can see that the parallel stream processes 8 items at a time, i.e. it uses 8 threads. However, if I uncomment the commented line, the output is:215 215 215 215 215 216 216 216 216 216 216 216 216 216 216 216 216 216 216 216This time, the parallel stream has used 20 threads and all 20 elements in the stream have been processed concurrently.Alternatively to the trick of triggering the parallel computation inside your own forkJoinPool you can also pass that pool to the CompletableFuture.supplyAsync method like in:Using a ForkJoinPool and submit for a parallel stream does not reliably use all threads. If you look at this ( Parallel stream from a HashSet doesn't run in parallel ) and this ( Why does the parallel stream not use all the threads of the ForkJoinPool? ), you\'ll see the reasoning.Short version: if ForkJoinPool/submit does not work for you, use To measure the actual number of used threads, you can check Thread.activeCount():This can produce on a 4-core CPU an output like:Without .parallel() it gives:Until now, I used the solutions described in the answers of this question. Now, I came up with a little library called Parallel Stream Support for that:But as @PabloMatiasGomez pointed out in the comments, there are drawbacks regarding the splitting mechanism of parallel streams which depends heavily on the size of the common pool. See Parallel stream from a HashSet doesn't run in parallel .I am using this solution only to have separate pools for different types of work but I can not set the size of the common pool to 1 even if I don\'t use it.Go to get AbacusUtil. Thread number can by specified for parallel stream. Here is the sample code:Disclosure\xef\xbc\x9a I\'m the developer of AbacusUtil.If you don\'t mind using a third-party library, with cyclops-react you can mix sequential and parallel Streams within the same pipeline and provide custom ForkJoinPools.
