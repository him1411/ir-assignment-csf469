What have I marked as --assume-unchanged? Is there any way to find out what I\'ve tucked away using that option?I\'ve dug through the .git/ directory and don\'t see anything that looks like what I\'d expect, but it must be somewhere. I\'ve forgotten what I marked this way a few weeks ago and now I need to document those details for future developers.You can use git ls-files -v.  If the character printed is lower-case, the file is marked assume-unchanged.To print just the files that are unchanged use:To embrace your lazy programmer, turn this into a git alias. Edit your .gitconfig file to add this snippet:Now typing git ignored will give you output like this:IMHO, git hidden is better for files marked as --assume-unchanged:Here\'s a list of related aliases I have in ~/.gitconfig:To make it work in subdirectories and support arguments:For example:For me most hidden files are marked with flag h, though there\'re actually several other flags according to the manual of git-ls-files-v:About git ls-files-t:This command works more consistently for me.  It will print only the files that are listed as \'assume-unchanged\'.
