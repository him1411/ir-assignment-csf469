I made some changes in my master branch and want to bring those upstream. when I cherry-pick the following commits however I get stuck on fd9f578 where git says:What is git trying to tell me and is cherry-pick the right thing to be using here?  The master branch does include changes to files which have been modified in the upstream branch, so I\'m sure there will be some merge conflicts but those aren\'t too bad to straighten out. I know which changes are needed where.These are the commits I want to bring upstream.The way a cherry-pick works is by taking the diff a changeset represents (the difference between the working tree at that point and the working tree of its parent), and applying it to your current branch.So, if a commit has two or more parents, it also represents two or more diffs - which one should be applied?You\'re trying to cherry pick fd9f578, which was a merge with two parents. So you need to tell the cherry-pick command which one against which the diff should be calculated, by using the -m option. For example, git cherry-pick -m 1 fd9f578 to use parent 1 as the base.I can\'t say for sure for your particular situation, but using git merge instead of git cherry-pick is generally advisable. When you cherry-pick a merge commit, it collapses all the changes made in the parent you didn\'t specify to -m into that one commit. You lose all their history, and glom together all their diffs. Your call.@Borealid\'s answer is correct, but suppose that you don\'t care about preserving the exact merging history of a branch and just want to cherry-pick a linearized version of it. Here\'s an easy and safe way to do that:Starting state: you are on branch X, and you want to cherry-pick the commits Y..Z.What this does is to create a branch tempZ based on Z, but with the history from Y onward linearized, and then cherry-pick that onto a copy of X called newX. (It\'s safer to do this on a new branch rather than to mutate X.) Of course there might be conflicts in step 4, which you\'ll have to resolve in the usual way (cherry-pick works very much like rebase in that respect).If step 2 gives the message "Current branch tempZ is up to date", then Y..Z was already linear, so just ignore that message and proceed with steps 3 and 4.Then review newX and see whether that did what you wanted.(Note: this is not the same as a simple git rebase X when on branch Z, because it doesn\'t depend in any way on the relationship between X and Y; there may be commits between the common ancestor and Y that you didn\'t want.)
