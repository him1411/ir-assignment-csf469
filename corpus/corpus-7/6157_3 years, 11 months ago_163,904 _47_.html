I have javascript object array:I want to get all values of key foo as array [ 1, 3, 5 ].There\'s the obvious manual way:Is there a "better" (shorter, more efficent and/or more idiomatic) way?Note about suggested duplicate, that question asks how to convert an object to an array, this question asks how to extract single property from an array of objects.Yes, but it relies on newer features of JavaScript. This means it will not work in IE8 or older.DocumentationCheck out Lodash\'s _.pluck() function or Underscore\'s _.pluck() function. Both do exactly what you want in a single function call!Update: _.pluck() has been removed as of Lodash v4.0.0, in favour of _.map() in combination with something similar to Niet\'s answer. _.pluck() is still available in Underscore.Update 2: As Mark points out in the comments, somewhere between Lodash v4 and 4.3, a new function has been added that provides this functionality again. _.property() is a shorthand function that returns a function for getting the value of a property in an object.Additionally, _.map() now allows a string to be passed in as the second parameter, which is passed into _.property(). As a result, the following two lines are equivalent to the code sample above from pre-Lodash 4._.property(), and hence _.map(), also allow you to provide a dot-separated string or array in order to access sub-properties:Both _.map() calls in the above example will return [5, 2, 9].If you\'re a little more into functional programming, take a look at Ramda\'s R.pluck() function, which would look something like this:Speaking for the JS only solutions, I\'ve found that, inelegant as it may be, a simple indexed for loop is more performant than its alternatives.https://jsperf.com/extract-prop-from-object-array/Extracting single property from a 100000 element arrayTraditional for loop 342 Ops/secES6 for..of loop 75 Ops/secArray.prototype.map 48 Ops/secUsing Array.prototype.map:See the above link for a shim for pre-ES5 browsers.It is better to use some sort of libraries like lodash or underscore for cross browser assurance.In lodash you can get values of a property in array by following methodand in underscore both will return [ 1, 3, 5 ]While map is a proper solution to select \'columns\' from a list of objects, it has a downside. If not explicitly checked whether or not the columns exists, it\'ll throw an error and (at best) provide you with undefined. \nI\'d opt for a reduce solution, which can simply ignore the property or even set you up with a default value.jsbin exampleThis would work even if one of the items in the provided list is not an object or does not contain the field.It can even be made more flexible by negotiating a default value should an item not be an object or not contain the field.jsbin exampleThis would be the same with map, as the length of the returned array would be the same as the provided array. (In which case a map is slightly cheaper than a reduce):jsbin exampleAnd then there is the most flexible solution, one which lets you switch between both behaviours simply by providing an alternative value.jsbin exampleAs the examples above (hopefully) shed some light on the way this works, lets shorten the function a bit by utilising the Array.concat function.jsbin exampleIt depends of your definition of "better".The other answers point out the use of map, which is natural (especially for guys used to functional style) and concise. I strongly recommend using it (if you don\'t bother with the few IE8- IT guys). So if "better" means "more concise", "maintainable", "understandable" then yes, it\'s way better.In the other hand, this beauty don\'t come without additional costs. I\'m not a big fan of microbench, but I\'ve put up a small test here. The result are predictable, the old ugly way seems to be faster than the map function. So if "better" means "faster", then no, stay with the old school fashion.Again this is just a microbench and in no way advocating against the use of map, it\'s just my two cents :).Function map is a good choice when dealing with object arrays. Although there have been a number of good answers posted already, the example of using map with combination with filter might be helpful.In case you want to exclude the properties which values are undefined or exclude just a specific property, you could do the following:https://jsfiddle.net/ohea7mgk/For an object with many keys, I like getting the value of each key this way: Object.keys(obj).map(function(e) { return obj[e] })We can use the array name along with the index and then dot separated property to get the value.
