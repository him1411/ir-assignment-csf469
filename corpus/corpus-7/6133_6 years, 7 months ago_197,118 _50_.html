I want to execute mongo commands in shell script.I tried following way test.shWhen I execute above script ./test.shThen mongo connection established but next commands not executedHow to execute other commands through sh script [test.sh] ?Please help meYou can also evaluate a command using the --eval flag, if it is just a single command.Please note: if you are using Mongo operators, starting with a $ sign, you\'ll want to surround the eval argument in single quotes to keep the shell from evaluating the operator as an environment variable:Otherwise you may see something like this:Put your mongo script into a .js file.Then execute mongo < yourFile.jsEx:demo.js  //file has your scriptkeep this file in "c:\\db-scripts"Then in cmd prompt go to "c:\\db-scripts"This will execute the code in mongo and shows the outputThis works for me under Linux:Put this in a file called test.js:then run it with mongo myDbName test.js.There is an official documentation page about this as well.Examples from that page include:The shell script below also worked nicely for me... definite had to use the redirect that Antonin mentioned at first... that gave me the idea to test the here document.In my setup I have to use: How about this:I use the "heredoc" syntax, which David Young mentions.  But there is a catch:The above will NOT work, because the phrase "$exists" will be seen by the shell and substituted with the value of the environment variable named "exists."  Which, likely, doesn\'t exist, so after shell expansion, it becomes: In order to have it pass through you have two options.  One is ugly, one is quite nice.  First, the ugly one: escape the $ signs:I do NOT recommend this, because it is easy to forget to escape.The other option is to escape the EOF, like this:Now, you can put all the dollar signs you want in your heredoc, and the dollar signs are ignored.  The down side: That doesn\'t work if you need to put shell parameters/variables in your mongo script.Another option you can play with is to mess with your shebang.  For example,There are several problems with this solution:It only works if you are trying to make a mongo shell script executable from the command line.  You can\'t mix regular shell commands with mongo shell commands.  And all you save by doing so is not having to type "mongo" on the command line...  (reason enough, of course)It functions exactly like "mongo <some-js-file>" which means it does not let you use the "use <db>" command.  I have tried adding the database name to the shebang, which you would think would work.  Unfortunately, the way the system processes the shebang line, everything after the first space is passed as a single parameter (as if quoted) to the env command, and env fails to find and run it.  Instead, you have to embed the database change within the script itself, like so:As with anything in life, "there is more than one way to do it!"Thank you printf!  In a Linux environment, here\'s a better way to have only one file run the show.  Say you have two files, mongoCmds.js with multiple commands:and then the driver shell file, runMongoCmds.shInstead, have just one file, runMongoCmds.sh containingBash\'s printf is much more robust than echo and allows for the \\n between commands to force them on multiple lines.As suggested by theTuxRacer, you can use the eval command, for those who are missing it like I was, you can also add in your db name if you are not trying to preform operation on the default db.--shell flag can also be used for javascript filesIn case you have authentication enabled:Create a script file; write commands:In file.js write your mongo query:Recently migrated from mongodb to Postgres. This is how I used the scripts.Read the scripts.js and output redirect to inserts.sql.scripts.js looks like thisinserts.sql looks like this
