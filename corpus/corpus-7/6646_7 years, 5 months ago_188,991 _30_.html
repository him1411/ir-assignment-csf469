This question already has an answer here:I know you can doEdit courtesy of @Pasi SavolainenTo getMy.Current.ClassBut what can I call to getMy.Current.Class.CurrentMethodOr, if you\'d like to have a helper method:Updated with credits to @stusmith.Call System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().Name from within the method.Reflection has a knack for hiding the forest for the trees.  You never have a problem getting the current method name accurately and quickly:Albeit that a refactoring tool probably won\'t fix it automatically.If you completely don\'t care about the (considerable) cost of using Reflection then this helper method should be useful:Update: C# version 5 and .NET 4.5 have the golden solution to this common need, you can use the [CallerMemberName] attribute to have the compiler auto-generate the name of the calling method in a string argument.  Other useful attributes are [CallerFilePath] to have the compiler generate the source code file path and [CallerLineNumber] to get the line number in the source code file for the statement that made the call.Update2: the syntax I proposed at the top of the answer can now be made to work in C# version 6 without a fancy refactoring tool:I think the best way to get the full name is:or try this You can also use MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod() which will inhibit the JIT compiler from inlining the method where it\'s used.Update:This method contains a special enumeration StackCrawlMark that from my understanding will specify to the JIT compiler that the current method should not be inlined.This is my interpretation of the comment associated to that enumeration present in SSCLI. The comment follows:Does this not work?Returns a MethodBase object representing the currently executing method.Namespace:  System.ReflectionAssembly:  mscorlib (in mscorlib.dll)http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.methodbase.getcurrentmethod.aspxCheck this out: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/MethodName.aspxWell System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().Name is not a very good choice \'cause it will just display the method name without additional information.Like for string MyMethod(string str) the above property will return just MyMethod which is hardly adequate.It is better to use System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().ToString() which will return the entire method signature...
