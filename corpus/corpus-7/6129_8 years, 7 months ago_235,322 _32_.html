Is there any way in which I can clean a database in SQl Server 2005 by dropping all the tables and deleting stored procedures, triggers, constraints and all the dependencies in one SQL statement?REASON FOR REQUEST:I want to have a DB script for cleaning up an existing DB which is not in use rather than creating new ones, especially when you have to put in a request to your DB admin and wait for a while to get it done!this script cleans all views, SPS, functions PKs, FKs and tables.I\'m using this script by Adam Anderson, updated to support objects in other schemas than dbo.Source: http://blog.falafel.com/Blogs/AdamAnderson/09-01-06/T-SQL_Drop_All_Objects_in_a_SQL_Server_Database.aspxThe best thing to do it is "Generate scripts for Drop"Select Database -> Right Click -> Tasks -> Generate Scripts - will open wizard for generating scriptsafter choosing objects in set Scripting option click Advanced ButtonIt includes dependent objects by default.(and will drop constraint at first)Execute the scriptThis way we can customize our script.To drop all tables:This will, of course, drop all constraints, triggers etc., everything but the stored procedures.For the stored procedures I\'m afraid you will need another stored procedure stored in master.I\'d do it in two statements: DROP DATABASE ???and then CREATE DATABASE ???Back up a completely empty database. Instead of dropping all the objects, just restore the backup.This is what I have tried:What ever the output it will print, just copy all and paste in new query and press execute.\nThis will delete all tables.I tried some of the script here, but they didn\'t work for me, as I have my tables in schemas.  So I put together the following.  Note that this script takes a list of schemas, and drops then in sequence.  You need to make sure that you have a complete ordering in your schemas.  If there are any circular dependencies, then it will fail.I accidentally ran a db init script against my master database tonight. Anyways, I quickly ran into this thread. I used the: exec sp_MSforeachtable \'DROP TABLE ?\' answer, but had to execute it multiple times until it didn\'t error (dependencies.) After that I stumbled upon some other threads and pieced this together to drop all the stored procedures and functions.Try thisIn addition to @Ivan\'s answer, types all need to be includedThere is no single statement that can be used to achieve this aim.You could of course create yourself a stored procedure that you could use to perform these various administrative tasks.You could then execute the procedure using this single statement.Seems like a rather dangerous feature to me. If you\'d implement something like this I would make sure to properly secure it in a way you won\'t be able to run this per accident.As suggested before you could make some sort of stored procedure yourself. \nIn SQL Server 2005 you could have a look this system table to determine and find the objects you would like to drop.Here I found new query to delete all sp,functions and triggers To add to Ivan\'s answer, I have also had the need to drop all user-defined types, so I have added this to the script:try this....
