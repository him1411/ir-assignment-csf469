In Java, what\'s the difference between:andBoth are private and final, the difference is the static attribute.What\'s better? And why?In general, static means "associated with the type itself, rather than an instance of the type."That means you can reference a static variable without having ever created an instances of the type, and any code referring to the variable is referring to the exact same data. Compare this with an instance variable: in that case, there\'s one independent version of the variable per instance of the class. So for example:prints out 10: y.instanceVariable and x.instanceVariable are separate, because x and y refer to different objects.You can refer to static members via references, although it\'s a bad idea to do so. If we did:then that would print out 20 - there\'s only one variable, not one per instance. It would have been clearer to write this as:That makes the behaviour much more obvious. Modern IDEs will usually suggest changing the second listing into the third.There is no reason to have a declaration such asIf it cannot change, there is no point having one copy per instance.For final, it can be assigned different values at runtime when initialized. \nFor exampleThus each instance has different value of field a.For static final, all instances share the same value, and can\'t be altered after first initialized. A static variable stays in the memory for the entire lifetime of the application, and is initialised during class loading. A non-static variable is being initialised each time you construct a new object. It\'s generally better to use:Why? This reduces the memory footprint per instance. It possibly is also favourable for cache hits. And it just makes sense: static should be used for things that are shared across all instances (a.k.a. objects) of a certain type (a.k.a. class).static means "associated with the class"; without it, the variable is associated with each instance of the class.  If it\'s static, that means you\'ll have only one in memory; if not, you\'ll have one for each instance you create.  static means the variable will remain in memory for as long as the class is loaded; without it, the variable can be gc\'d when its instance is.Reading the answers I found no real test really getting to the point. Here are my 2 cents :Results for first object :Results for 2nd object :Conclusion :As I thought java makes a difference between primitive and other types. Primitive types in Java are always "cached", same for strings literals (not new String objects), so no difference between static and non-static members.However there is a memory duplication for non-static members if they are not instance of a primitive type.Changing value of valueStatic to 10 will even go further as Java will give the same addresses to the two int variables.While the other answers seem to make it pretty clear that there is generally no reason to use non-static constants, I couldn\'t find anyone pointing out that it is possible to have various instances with different values on their constant variables.Consider the following example:Creating three instances of TestClass would print the same random value three times, since only one value is generated and stored into the static constant.However, when trying the following example instead:Creating three instances of TestClass would now print three different random values, because each instance has its own randomly generated constant value.I can\'t think of any situation where it would be really useful to have different constant values on different instances, but I hope this helps pointing out that there is a clear difference between static and non-static finals.There isn\'t much difference as they are both constants. For most class data objects, static would mean something associated with the class itself, there being only one copy no matter how many objects were created with new.Since it is a constant, it may not actually be stored in either the class or in an instance, but the compiler still isn\'t going to let you access instance objects from a static method, even if it knows what they would be. The existence of the reflection API may also require some pointless work if you don\'t make it static.As already Jon said, a static variable, also referred to as a class variable, is a variable which exists across instances of a class.I found an example of this here:Output of the program is given below:As we can see in this example each object has its own copy of class variable.From the tests i have made, static final variables are not the same with final(non-static) variables! Final(non-static) variables can differ from object to object!!! But that\'s only if the initialization is made within the constructor! (If it is not initialized from the constructor then it is only a waste of memory as it creates final variables for every object that is created that cannot be altered.)For example:What shows up on screen is:About Object: A@addbf1\n Final: 14\n Static Final: 5About Object: A@530daa\n Final: 21\n Static Final: 5Anonymous 1st year IT student, GreeceFurthermore to Jon\'s answer if you use static final it will behave as a kind-of "definition". Once you compile the class which uses it, it will be in the compiled .class file burnt.\nCheck my thread about it here.For your main goal: If you don\'t use the NUMBER differently in the different instances of the class i would advise to use final and static.\n(You just have to keep in mind to not to copy compiled class files without considering possible troubles like the one my case study describes. Most of the cases this does not occur, don\'t worry :) )To show you how to use different values in instances check this code:Here is my two cents:Example:The key is that variables and functions can return different values.Therefore final variables can be assigned with different values.Since a variable in a class is declared as final AND initialised in the same command,\nthere is absolutely no reason to not declare it as static, since it will have the same value no matter the instance. So, all instances can share the same memory address for a value, thus saving processing time by eliminating the need to create a new variable for each instance and saving memory by sharing 1 common address.private static final will be considered as constant and the constant can be accessed within this class only. Since, the keyword static included, the value will be constant for all the objects of the class.private final variable value will be like constant per object.You can refer the java.lang.String or look for the example below.//Output:The static one is the same member on all of the class instances and the class itself.\nThe non-static is one for every instance (object), so in your exact case it\'s a waste of memory if you don\'t put static.If you mark this variable static then as you know, you would be requiring static methods to again access these values,this will be useful if you already think of using these variables only in static methods. If this is so then this would be the best one.You can however make the variable now as public since no one can modify it just like "System.out", it again depends upon your intentions and what you want to achieve.Lets say if the class will not have more than one instance ever, then which one takes more memory:private static final int ID = 250;\nor\nprivate final int ID = 250;I\'ve understood that static will refer to the class type with only one copy in the memory and non static will be in a new memory location for each instance variable. However internally if we just compare 1 instance of the same class ever (i.e. more than 1 instance would not be created), then is there any overhead in terms of space used by 1 static final variable?Static variable belongs to the class (which means all the objects share that variable). Non static variable belongs to each objects.As you can see above example, for "final int" we can assign our variable for each instance (object) of the class, however for "static final int", we should assign a variable in the class (static variable belongs to the class).Just Another simple example to understand the usage of static, static final, final variables. Code comments have the proper explanation.This might help
