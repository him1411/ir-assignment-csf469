In my project I need the Google cache age to be added as important information. I tried to search sources for the Google cache age, that is, the number of days since Google last re-indexed the page listed.Where can I get the Google cache age?Use the URLExample:http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:stackoverflow.comIt contains a header like this:This is Google\'s cache of https://stackoverflow.com/. It is a snapshot of the page as it appeared on 21 Aug 2012 11:33:38 GMT. The current page could have changed in the meantime.
