Does crontab have an argument for creating cron jobs without using the editor (crontab -e). If so, What would be the code create a cronjob from a Bash script?You can add to the crontab as follows:Source nixCraft.You may be able to do it on-the-flyThanks everybody for your help. Piecing together what I found here and elsewhere I came up with this:I couldn\'t figure out how to eliminate the need for the two variables without repeating myself.command is obviously the command I want to schedule. job takes $command and adds the scheduling data. I needed both variables separately in the line of code that does the work.This line of code filters out any cron jobs that match the command, then writes out the remaining cron jobs with the new one, effectively acting like an "add" or "update" function.\nTo use this, all you have to do is swap out the values for the command and job variables.More readable IMHO, and immune to multiple insertions.Say you have these:To add it to the crontab, with no duplication:To remove it from the crontab:Note: grep -F matches the string literally, as we do not want to interpret it as a regular expression.EDIT (fixed overwriting):Chances are you are automating this, and you don\'t want a single job added twice.\nIn that case use:This only works if you\'re using BASH. I\'m not aware of the correct DASH (sh) syntax.A variant which only edits crontab if the desired string is not found there:For a nice quick and dirty creation/replacement of a crontab from with a BASH script, I used this notation:There have been a lot of good answers around the use of crontab, but no mention of a simpler method, such as using cron.Using cron would take advantage of system files and directories located at /etc/crontab, /etc/cron.daily,weekly,hourly or /etc/cron.d/:In this above example, we created a file in /etc/cron.d/, provided the environment variables for the command to execute successfully, and provided the user for the command, and the command itself. This file should not be executable and the name should only contain alpha-numeric and hyphens (more details below).To give a thorough answer though, let\'s look at the differences between crontab vs cron/crond:For those who want to run the job in the context of their user on the system, using crontab may make perfect sense.For those who use configuration management or want to manage jobs for other users, in which case we should use cron.A quick excerpt from the manpages gives you a few examples of what to and not to do:/etc/crontab and the files in /etc/cron.d must be owned  by  root,  and must  not  be  group- or other-writable. In contrast to the spool area, the files  under  /etc/cron.d  or  the  files  under  /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily,  /etc/cron.weekly  and  /etc/cron.monthly  may also be symlinks, provided that both the symlink and the file it points to  are owned  by  root.   The  files  under  /etc/cron.d  do  not  need  to be executable, while the files  under  /etc/cron.hourly,  /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.monthly do, as they are run by run-parts (see run-parts(8) for more information).Source: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/cron.8.htmlManaging crons in this manner is easier and more scalable from a system perspective, but will not always be the best solution.If you\'re using the Vixie Cron, e.g. on most Linux distributions, you can just put a file in /etc/cron.d with the individual cronjob.This only works for root of course. If your system supports this you should see several examples in there. (Note the username included in the line, in the same syntax as the old /etc/crontab)It\'s a sad misfeature in cron that there is no way to handle this as a regular user, and that so many cron implementations have no way at all to handle this.No, there is no option in crontab to modify the cron files.You have to: take the current cron file (crontab -l > newfile), change it and put the new file in place (crontab newfile).If you are familiar with perl, you can use this module Config::Crontab.LLP, AndreaHere is a bash function for adding a command to crontab without duplicationscript function to add cronjobs. check duplicate entries,useable expressions * > "tested :source : my brain ;)add -w parameter to grep exact command, without -w parameter adding the cronjob "testing" cause deletion of cron job "testing123"script function to add/remove cronjobs. no duplication entries :tested :You can probably change the default editor to ed and use a heredoc to edit.Note the leading > in that code means the return/enter key is pressed to create a new line. The a means APPEND so it will not overwrite anything. The . means you\'re done editing. The w means WRITE the changes.The q means QUIT or exit ed.you can check it outYou can delete an entry too.That will delete the crontab entry with Myscript in it.The d means delete the pattern  inside the / /.No check it againThis solution works inside a script too less the > of course :-)
