To check if a type is a subclass of another type in C#, it\'s easy:However, this will fail:Is there any way to check whether a type is either a subclass OR of the base class itself, without using an OR operator or using an extension method?Apparently, no.Here\'s the options:As you\'ve already found out, this will not work if the two types are the same, here\'s a sample LINQPad program that demonstrates:Output:Which indicates that Derived is a subclass of Base, but that Baseis (obviously) not a subclass of itself.Now, this will answer your particular question, but it will also give you false positives. As Eric Lippert has pointed out in the comments, while the method will indeed return True for the two above questions, it will also return True for these, which you probably don\'t want:Here you get the following output:The last True there would indicate, if the method only answered the question asked, that uint[] inherits from int[] or that they\'re the same type, which clearly is not the case.So IsAssignableFrom is not entirely correct either.The "problem" with is and as in the context of your question is that they will require you to operate on the objects and write one of the types directly in code, and not work with Type objects.In other words, this won\'t compile:nor will this:nor will this:While the above methods might fit your needs, the only correct answer to your question (as I see it) is that you will need an extra check:which of course makes more sense in a method:You should try using Type.IsAssignableFrom instead.I\'m posting this answer with the hope of someone sharing with me if and why it would be a bad idea.  In my application, I have a property of Type that I want to check to be sure it is typeof(A) or typeof(B), where B is any class derived from A.  So my code:I feel like I might be a bit naive here so any feedback would be welcome.
