Is it possible to make a HTML page behave, for example, like a A4-sized page in MS Word?Essentially, I want to be able to show the HTML page in the browser, and outline the content in the dimensions of an A4 size page. For the sake of simplicity, I\'m assuming that the HTML page will only contain text (no images etc.) and there will be no <br> tags for example.Also, when the HTML page is printed, it would come out as A4-sized paper pages.Ages ago, in November 2005, AlistApart.com published an article on how they published a book using nothing but HTML and CSS. See: http://alistapart.com/article/boomHere\'s an excerpt of that article:CSS2 has a notion of paged media (think sheets of paper), as opposed to continuous media (think scrollbars). Style sheets can set the size of pages and their margins. Page templates can be given names and elements can state which named page they want to be printed on. Also, elements in the source document can force page breaks. Here is a snippet from the style sheet we used:Having a US-based publisher, we were given the page size in inches. We, being Europeans, continued with metric measurements. CSS accepts both.After setting the up the page size and margin, we needed to make sure there are page breaks in the right places. The following excerpt shows how page breaks are generated after chapters and appendices:Also, we used CSS2 to declare named pages:That is, the title page is to be printed on pages with the name \xe2\x80\x9cblank.\xe2\x80\x9d CSS2 described the concept of named pages, but their value only becomes apparent when headers and footers are available. Anyway\xe2\x80\xa6Since you want to print A4, you\'ll need different dimensions of course:The article dives into things like setting page-breaks, etc. so you might want to read that completely.In your case, the trick is to create the print CSS first. Most modern browsers (>2005) support zooming and will already be able to display a website based on the print CSS. Now, you\'ll want to make the web display look a bit different and adapt the whole design to fit most browsers too (including the old, pre 2005 ones). For that, you\'ll have to create a web CSS file or override some parts of your print CSS. When creating CSS for web display, remember that a browser can have ANY size (think: \xe2\x80\x9cmobile\xe2\x80\x9d up to \xe2\x80\x9cbig-screen TVs\xe2\x80\x9d). Meaning: for the web CSS your page-width and image-width is best set using a variable width (%) to support as many display devices and web-browsing clients as possible. EDIT (26-02-2015)Today, I happened to stumble upon another, more recent article at SmashingMagazine which also dives into designing for print with HTML and CSS\xe2\x80\xa6 just in case you could use yet-another-tutorial.It would be fairly easy to force the web browser to display the page with the same pixel dimensions as A4. However, there may be a few quirks when things are rendered.Assuming your monitors display 72 dpi, you could add something like this:Create section with each page, and use the below code to adjust margins, height and width.If you are printing A4 size.Then userthen create a div with all your content in it.orI\'ve used HTML to generate reports which print-out correctly at real sizes on real paper.If you carefully use mm as your units in the CSS file you should be OK, at least for single pages.  People can screw you up by changing the print zoom in their browser, though.  I seem to remember everything I was doing was single page, so I didn\'t have to worry about pagination - that might be much harder.A4 size is 210x297mmSo you can set the HTML page to fit those sizes with CSS:In your normal style.css:In your print.css:PPI and DPI make absolutely no difference to how a document will print off a browser.  the printer takes no information on screen dot pitch or the DPI of the images etc.  if you are printing images they would print at a size similar in proportion to how they are displayed on screen.  the print processor of the browser would increase the DPI of the images from something rather low like 72dpi to whatever DPI the rest of the document is.  say the image displays as half a page wide, then its about 4" wide physically.  the pixel width of the image would be approx 300px to display correctly in the browser.  by the time it prints at a nominal 300DPI, the processor has added pixels and the image will grow to around 1200px which at 300 DPI is 4".when it comes to vector or non pixel based elements like text, the printer chooses its own DPI from the driver which doesnt relate to screen dot pitch or browser width etc.  if the browser is 3000px wide, the print processor will wrap text as appropriate.heres what makes it hard about creating print displays:  each browser and printer will interpret text sizes (pt, em, px) and spacing in its own way.  depending on what printer, browser and maybe even OS you use, you will get a different amount of lines and characters per page.  so even if you test on your computer using your browser and printer and figure out that you can display the text in a box at 640x900px and its perfect on print, the next guy who tries to print will possibly get it printing differently.  there really is no way to force each printer and browser to get it identical each time.forget pixels and moreso forget DPI, the only thing you could use pixels for is setting a table width that simulates the width of a printable area on your printer.  in that case i found that 640px wide is close.Looking for similar problem I found this - http://www.indigorose.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-13334.htmlA4 is a document format, as a screen image that\'s going to depend on the image resolution, for example an A4 document resized to:Technically, you could, but it would take a lot of work to get all browsers to print out the page exactly as it is displayed on screen. Also, most browsers force the URL, print date and page numbering on the print-out, which is not always desired. This cannot be altered or disabled.Instead, I would advise to create a PDF based on the contents on screen and serve the PDF for downloading and/or printing. Although most available PDF libraries are paid, there are a few free alternatives available for creating basic PDFs.I know that this subject is quite old but I want to share my experience about that topic. Actually, I was searching a module that can help me with my daily reports. I\'m writting some documentations and some reports in HTML + CSS (instead of Word, Latex, OO, ...). The objectif would be to print them on A4 paper to share it with friends, ... Instead of searching, I decided to have a small funny coding session to implement a simple lib that can handle "pages", page number, summary, header, footer, .... Finally, I did it in ~~2h and I know that\'s not the best tool ever but it\'s almost ok for my purpose. You can take a look at this project on my repo and don\'t hesitate to share your ideas. It\'s maybe not what you are searching for at 100% but I think that this module can help you.Basically I create a page of body "width: 200mm;" and container of height: 290mm (smaller than A4). Then I used page-break-after: always; so the "print" option of the browser know when to split pages.repo: https://github.com/kursion/jsprintIt\'s entirely possible to set your layout to assume the proportions of an a4 page. You would only have to set width and height accordingly (possibly check with window.innerHeight and window.innerWidth although I\'m not sure if that is reliable).The tricky part is with printing A4. Javascript for example only supports printing pages rudimentarily with the  window.print method.\nAs @Prutswonder suggested creating a PDF from the webpage probably is the most sophisticated way of doing this (other than supplying PDF documentation in the first place). However, this is not as trivial as one might think. Here\'s a link that has a description of an all open source Java class to create PDFs from HTML: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-04-2006/jw-0410-html.html .Obviously once you have created a PDF with A4 proportions printing it will result in a clean A4 print of your page. Whether that\'s worth the time investment is another question.I saw this solution after searching at google, search for "A4 CSS page template" (codepen.io). It shows an A4 (A3,A5, also portrait) sized area in the browser, using the <page> tag. Inside this tag the content is shown, but absolute position is still with respect to browser area.This works for me without any other css/js-library to be included. Works for current browsers (IE, FF, Chrome). I have used 680px in commercial reports to print on A4 pages since 1998. The 700px could not fit correctly depend of size of margins. Modern browsers can shrink page to fit page on printer, but if you use 680 pixels you will print correctly in almost any browsers.That is HTML to you Run code snippet and see de result:JSFiddle:https://jsfiddle.net/ajofmm7r/Many ways to do:
