This question already has an answer here:For js within page.html,how can it retrieve GET parameters?For the above simple example,func(\'returnurl\') should be /adminBut it should also work for complex querystrngs...With the window.location object. This code gives you GET without the question mark.From your example it will return returnurl=%2FadminEDIT: I took the liberty of changing Qwerty\'s answer, which is really good, and as he pointed I followed exactly what the OP asked:I removed the duplicated function execution from his code, replacing it a variable ( tmp ) and also I\'ve added decodeURIComponent, exactly as OP asked. I\'m not sure if this may or may not be a security issue.Or otherwise with plain for cycle, which will work even in IE8:window.location.search will return everything from the ? on.  This will remove the ?, use split to separate into key/value arrays, then assign named properties to the params object:You can then get the test parameter from http://myurl.com/?test=1 by calling params.test.This is the simplest solution. It unfortunately does not handle multi-valued keys and encoded characters.  See the original answer at How can I get query string values in JavaScript?Hey here is the right answer for 2016:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams\nhttps://polyfill.io/v2/docs/features/a more fancy way to do it: :)i do it like this (to retrieve a specific get-parameter, here \'parameterName\'):Here i\'ve made this code to transform the GET parameters into an object to use them more easily.If you don\'t mind using a library instead of rolling your own implementation, check out https://github.com/jgallen23/querystring.This solution handles URL decoding:Usage:This one use regex and return null if param doesn\'t exist or has no value:My solution expands on @tak3r \'sIt returns an empty object when there are no query params and supports the array notation ?a=1&a=2&a=3:If you are using angularjs, you can use $routeParams using ngRoute module  You have to add module on your app  Now you can use service $routeParams You can use search function available in location object. Search function gives the parameter part of the URL. details can be found here - http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/location.shtmlYou will have to parse the resulting string for getting the variables and their values e.g. splitting them on \'=\'To get the parameters as a JSON object:I have created a simple Javascript function to access GET parameters from URL.Just include this Javascript source and you can access get parameters.\n E.g.: in http://example.com/index.php?language=french, the language variable can be accessed as $_GET["language"].  Similarly, a list of all parameters in stored in a variable $_GET_Params as an array.  Both the Javascript and HTML are provided in the following code snippet:Here is another example based on Kat\'s and Bakudan\'s example above, but making it a just a bit more generic.
