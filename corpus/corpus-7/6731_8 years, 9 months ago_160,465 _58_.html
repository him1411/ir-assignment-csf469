In a .NET 2.0 C# application I use the following code to detect the operating system platform:This returns "Win32NT". The problem is that it returns "Win32NT" even when running on Windows Vista 64-bit.Is there any other method to know the correct platform (32 or 64 bit)?Note that it should also detect 64 bit when run as a 32 bit application on Windows 64 bit.IntPtr.Size won\'t return the correct value if running in 32-bit .NET Framework 2.0 on 64-bit Windows (it would return 32-bit).As Microsoft\'s Raymond Chen describes, you have to first check if running in a 64-bit process (I think in .NET you can do so by checking IntPtr.Size), and if you are running in a 32-bit process, you still have to call the Win API function IsWow64Process. If this returns true, you are running in a 32-bit process on 64-bit Windows.Microsoft\'s Raymond Chen:\nHow to detect programmatically whether you are running on 64-bit WindowsMy solution:.NET 4 has two new properties in the Environment class, Is64BitProcess and Is64BitOperatingSystem. Interestingly, if you use Reflector you can see they are implemented differently in the 32-bit & 64-bit versions of mscorlib. The 32-bit version returns false for Is64BitProcess and calls IsWow64Process via P/Invoke for Is64BitOperatingSystem. The 64-bit version just returns true for both.If you\'re using .NET Framework 4.0, it\'s easy:See Environment.Is64BitOperatingSystem Property  (MSDN).This is just an implementation of what\'s suggested above by Bruno Lopez, but works on Win2k + all WinXP service packs. Just figured I\'d post it so other people didn\'t have roll it by hand. (would have posted as a comment, but I\'m a new user!)The full answer is this (taken from both stefan-mg, ripper234 and BobbyShaftoe\'s answer):First check if you\'re in a 64 bit process. If you\'re not, check if the 32 bit process is a Wow64Process.Microsoft has put a code sample for this:http://1code.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/39074#842775It looks like this:There is a WMI version available as well (for testing remote machines).You can also check for the PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE environment variable.It either doesn\'t exist or is set to "x86" on 32-bit Windows.@foobar: You are right, it is too easy ;)In 99% of the cases, developers with weak system administrator backgrounds ultimately fail to realize the power Microsoft has always provided for anyone to enumerate Windows.System administrators will always write better and simpler code when it comes to such a point.Nevertheless, one thing to note, build configuration must be AnyCPU for this environment variable to return the correct values on the correct systems:This will return "X86" on 32-bit Windows, and "AMD64" on 64-bit Windows.Try this:From Chriz Yuen blogC# .Net 4.0 Introduced two new environment property\nEnvironment.Is64BitOperatingSystem;\nEnvironment.Is64BitProcess;Please be careful when you use these both property. \nTest on Windows 7 64bits Machine Quickest way:Note: this is very direct.Use these two environment variables (pseudo code):Refer to the blog post HOWTO: Detect Process Bitness.Using dotPeek helps to see how the framework actually does it. With that in mind, here\'s what I\'ve come up with:Example usage:I need to do this, but I also need to be able as an admin do it remotely, either case this seems to work quite nicely for me:This is a solution based on Microsoft\'s code at http://1code.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/39074#842775. It uses extension methods for easy code reuse.Some possible usage is shown below:Here is the direct approach in C# using DllImport from this page.I found this to be the best way to check for the platform of the system and the process:The first property returns true for 64-bit system, and false for 32-bit.\nThe second property returns true for 64-bit process, and false for 32-bit.The need for these two properties is because you can run 32-bit processes on 64-bit system, so you will need to check for both the system and the process.All fine, but this should also work from env:..Too easy, maybe ;-)I\'m using the followin code. Note: It\'s made for an AnyCPU project.Here\'s a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) approach:OSInfo.BitsUse this to get the installed Windows architecture:Include the following code into a class in your project:Use it like so:I used this check with success on many operating systems:This folder is always named "SysWOW64", no matter of the language of the operating system. This works for .NET Framework 1.1 or above.Just see if the "C:\\Program Files (x86)" exists. If not, then you are on a 32 bit OS. If it does, then the OS is 64 bit (Windows Vista or Windows 7). It seems simple enough...Enjoy ;-)I use:This gets the path where your application is launched in case you have it installed in various places on the computer. Also, you could just do the general C:\\ path since 99.9% of computers out there have Windows installed in C:\\.I use a version of the following:
