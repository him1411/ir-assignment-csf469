I have a file that has around million lines. So, I need to go to line number 320123 to check the data, how do I do that?With n being the line number:So to go to line number 320123, you would type 320123g.Copy-pasted straight from Wikipedia.To open at a specific line straight from the command line, use:If you want to see the line numbers too:You can also choose to display a specific line of the file at a specific line of the terminal, for when you need a few lines of context. For example, this will open the file with line 320123 on the 10th line of the terminal:You can use sed for this too - This will print line number 320123. If you want a range then you can do -If you want from a particular line to the very end then -From within less (in Linux): Used alone, g and G will take you to the first and last line in a file respectively; used with a number they are both equivalent.An example; you want to go to line 320123 of a file,press \'g\' and after the colon type in the number 320123Additionally you can type \'-N\' inside less to activate / deactivate the line numbers. You can as a matter of fact pass any command line switches from inside the program, such as -j or -N.NOTE: You can provide the line number in the command line to start less (less +number -N) which will be much faster than doing it from inside the program: This will open a file displaying the line numbers and starting at line 12345Source: man 1 less and built-in help in less (less 418)For editing this is possible in nano via +n from command line, e.g.,nano +16 file.txtTo open file.txt to line 16.
