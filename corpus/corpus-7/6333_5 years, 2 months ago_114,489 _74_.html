The scripts portion of my package.json currently looks like this:...which means I can run npm start to start the server. So far so good.However, I would like to be able to run something like npm start 8080 and have the argument(s) passed to script.js (e.g. npm start 8080 => node ./script.js server 8080). Is this possible?Edit 2014.10.30: It\'s possible to pass args to npm run as of npm 2.0.0The syntax is as follows:npm run <command> [-- <args>]Note the necessary --. It is needed to separate the params passed to npm command itself and params passed to your script.So if you have in package.jsonThen the equivalent ofgrunt task:targetrun via npm would benpm run grunt -- task:targetand the equivalent of node server.js --port=1337will benpm run server -- --port=1337Edit 2013.10.03: It\'s not currently possible directly. But there\'s a related GitHub issue opened on npm to implement the behavior you\'re asking for. Seems the consensus is to have this implemented, but it depends on another issue being solved before.Original answer: As a some kind of workaround (though not very handy), you can do as follows:Say your package name from package.json is myPackage and you have alsoThen add in package.json:And in your script.js:That way, by default npm start will use 8080. You can however configure it (the value will be stored by npm in its internal storage):Then, when invoking npm start, 9090 will be used (the default from package.json gets overridden).You asked to be able to run something like npm start 8080.  This is possible without needing to modify script.js or configuration files as follows.For example, in your "scripts" JSON value, include--And then from the command-line:I have confirmed that this works using bash and npm 1.4.23.  Note that this work-around does not require GitHub npm issue #3494 to be resolved.You could also do that:In package.json:In cool.js:In CLI:Should output:Update: Using npm 3.10.3, it appears that it lowercases the process.env.npm_config_ variables? I\'m also using better-npm-run, so I\'m not sure if this is vanilla default behavior or not, but this answer is working. Instead of process.env.npm_config_myVar, try process.env.npm_config_myvarjakub.g\'s answer is correct, however an example using grunt seems a bit complex.So my simpler answer:- Sending a command line argument to an npm scriptSyntax for sending command line arguments to an npm script:Imagine we have an npm start task in our package.json to kick off webpack dev server:We run this from the command line with npm start Now if we want to pass in a port to the npm script:running this and passing the port e.g. 5000 via command line would be as follows:- Using package.json config:As mentioned by jakub.g, you can alternatively set params in the config of your package.jsonnpm start will use the port specified in your config, or alternatively you can override it- Setting a param in your npm scriptAn example of reading a variable set in your npm script. In this example NODE_ENVread NODE_ENV in server.js either prod or devnpm 2.x support cli argsCommandnpm run-script start -- --foo=3Package.json"start": "node ./index.js"Index.jsconsole.log(\'process.argv\', process.argv);If you want to pass arguments to the middle of an npm script, as opposed to just having them appended to the end, then inline environment variables seem to work nicely:Here, npm run dev passes the -w watch flag to babel, but npm run start just runs a regular build once.This doesn\'t really answer your question but you could always use environment variables instead:Then in your server.js file:From what I see, people use package.json scripts when they would like to run script in simpler way. For example, to use nodemon that installed in local node_modules, we can\'t call nodemon directly from the cli, but we can call it by using ./node_modules/nodemon/nodemon.js. So, to simplify this long typing, we can put this...... then call npm start to use \'nodemon\' which has app.js as the first argument.What I\'m trying to say, if you just want to start your server with the node command, I don\'t think you need to use scripts. Typing npm start or node app.js has the same effort.But if you do want to use nodemon, and want to pass a dynamic argument, don\'t use script either. Try to use symlink instead.For example using migration with sequelize. I create a symlink...ln -s node_modules/sequelize/bin/sequelize sequelize... And I can pass any arguement when I call it ...etc...At this point, using symlink is the best way I could figure out, but I don\'t really think it\'s the best practice.I also hope for your opinion to my answer.Use process.argv in your code then just provide a trailing $* to your scripts value entry.echoargs.js:package.json:Examples:process.argv[0] is the executable (node), process.argv[1] your script.Tested with npm v5.3.0 and node v8.4.0
