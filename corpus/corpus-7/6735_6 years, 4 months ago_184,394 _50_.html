I need a really, really fast method of checking if a string is JSON or not. I feel like this is not the best way:Any performance enthusiasts out there want to improve this method?Answer to the QuestionThe function json_last_error returns the last error occurred during the JSON encoding and decoding. So the fastest way to check the valid JSON isNote that json_last_error is supported in PHP >= 5.3.0 only.Full program to check the exact ERRORIt is always good to know the exact error during the development time. Here is full program to check the exact error based on PHP docs.Testing with Valid JSON INPUTValid OUTPUTTesting with invalid JSONInvalid OUTPUTExtra note for (PHP >= 5.2 && PHP < 5.3.0)Since json_last_error is not supported in PHP 5.2, you can check if the encoding or decoding returns boolean FALSE. Here is an exampleHope this is helpful. Happy Coding!Using json_decode to "probe" it might not actually be the fastest way. If it\'s a deeply nested structure, then instantiating a lot of objects of arrays to just throw them away is a waste of memory and time. So it might be faster to use preg_match and the RFC4627 regex to also ensure validity:The same in PHP:Not enough of a performance enthusiast to bother with benchmarks here however. All you really need to do is this...This request does not require a separate function even. Just wrap is_object around json_decode and move on. Seems this solution has people putting way too much thought into it.http://tr.php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php return value is null when invalid encoding detected.You must validate your input to make sure the string you pass is not empty and is, in fact, a string. An empty string is not valid JSON.I think in PHP it\'s more important to determine if the JSON object even has data, because to use the data you will need to call json_encode() or json_decode(). I suggest denying empty JSON objects so you aren\'t unnecessarily running encodes and decodes on empty data.This will return true if your string represents a json array or object:It rejects json strings that only contains a number, string or boolean, although those strings are technically valid json.It is the shortest way I can come up with.Another simple wayEarlier i was just checking for a null value, which was wrong actually.The above piece of code works fine with strings. However as soon as i provide number, it breaks up.for example.To fix it what i did was very simple.The most simplest and fastest way that I use is following;It is because  json_decode() returns NULL if the entered string is not json or invalid json.   We need to check if passed string is not numeric because in this case json_decode raises no error.Easy method is to check the json result..in GuzzleHttp:I don\'t know about performance or elegance of my solution, but it\'s what I\'m using:Since all my JSON encoded strings start with {" it suffices to test for this with a RegEx. I\'m not at all fluent with RegEx, so there might be a better way to do this. Also: strpos() might be quicker.Just trying to give in my tuppence worth.P.S. Just updated the RegEx string to /^[\\[\\{]\\"/ to also find JSON array strings. So it now looks for either [" or {" at the beginning of the string.Expanding on this answer How about the following:The custom functionCasesResourceshttps://gist.github.com/rafasashi/93d06bae83cc1a1f440bFreshly-made function for PHP 5.2 compatibility, if you need the decoded data on success:Usage:Some tests:A simple modification to henrik\'s answer to touch most required possibilities.The fastest way to maybe decode a possible JSON object to a PHP object/array:check it with this function:
