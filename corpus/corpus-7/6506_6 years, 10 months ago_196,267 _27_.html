Since I updated to Maven 3 I get the following warning messages at each build :How can I get rid of these warnings?Add a <version> element after the <plugin> <artifactId> in your pom.xml file. Find the following text:Add the version tag to it:The warning should be resolved.Regarding this:\'build.plugins.plugin.version\' for\n  org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin is missingMany people have mentioned why the issue is happening, but fail to suggest a fix. All I needed to do was to go into my POM file for my project, and add the <version> tag as shown above.To discover the version number, one way is to look in Maven\'s output after it finishes running. Where you are missing version numbers, Maven will display its default version:Take that version number (as in the 2.3.2 above) and add it to your POM, as shown.Run like:for plug-in that have no version. You get output:Use version that shown in output.UPDATE If you want to select among list of versions, use http://search.maven.org/ or http://mvnrepository.com/ Note that your favorite Java IDE must have Maven package search dialog. Just check docs.SUPER UPDATE I also use:Recently I discover how to get latest version for plug-in (or library) so no longer needs for googling or visiting Maven Central:Maven 3 is more restrictive with the POM-Structure. You have to set versions of Plugins for instance.With maven 3.1 these warnings may break you build.
