I got an array (see below for one object in the array) that I need to sort by firstname using JavaScript.\nHow can I do it?Suppose you have an array users. You may use users.sort and pass a function that takes two arguments and compare them (comparator)It should return In our case if two elements are a and b we want to compare a.firstname and b.firstnameExample:This code is going to work with any type.Note that in "real life"\xe2\x84\xa2 you often want to ignore case, correctly sort diacritics, weird symbols like \xc3\x9f, etc when you compare strings, so you may want to use localeCompare. See other answers for clarity.Something like this:If compared strings contain unicode characters you can use localeCompare function of String class like the following:Shortest possible code with ES6!String.prototype.localeCompare() basic support is universal!Nice little ES6 one liner:underscorejs offers the very nice _.sortBy function:or you can use a custom sort function:Basically you can sort arrays with method sort, but if you want to sort objects then you have to pass function to sort method of array, so I will give you an example using your arrayA more compact notation:You can use the in-built array method - sort. This method takes a callback method as a paramKey Points to be noted for understanding this code.I hope this is clear enough explanation. Feel free to comment if you think, more info is needed. Cheers!You can use something similar, to get rid of case sensitive Pushed the top answers into a prototype to sort by key.\n
