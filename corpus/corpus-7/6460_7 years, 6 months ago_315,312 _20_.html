How do I get a Dictionary key by value in C#?I want something like this:getByValueKey("one") must be return "1".What is the best way do this? Maybe HashTable, SortedLists?Values not necessarily have to be unique so you have to do a lookup. You can do something like this:If values are unique and are inserted less frequently than read, then create an inverse dictionary where values are keys and keys are values.You could do that:Use Method 1 if performance is not a consideration, use Method 2 if memory is not a consideration.Also, all keys must be unique, but the values are not required to be unique.  You may have more than one key with the specified value.Is there any reason you can\'t reverse the key-value relationship?What if the value exists for more than one key?Which key should be returned?To avoid making assumptions Microsoft hasn\'t included a GetKey method.maybe something like this:Values.ToList() converts your dictionary values into a List of objects.\nIndexOf("one") searches your new List looking for "one" and returns the Index which would match the index of the Key/Value pair in the dictionary.This method does not care about the dictionary keys, it simply returns the index of the value that you are looking for.Keep in mind there may be more than one "one" value in your dictionary. And that is the reason there is no "get key" method.Below Code only works if It contain Unique Value Data I have very simple way to do this. It worked out perfect for me.
