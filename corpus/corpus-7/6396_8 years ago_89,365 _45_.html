How can I show a git log output with (at least) this information: I want it compressed to one line per log entry. What\'s the shortest possible format for that?(tried --format=oneline but that does not show the date)git log --pretty=format:"%h%x09%an%x09%ad%x09%s"did the job. This outputs:Inspired by stackoverflow question: "git log output like svn ls -v", i found out that I could add the exact params I needed.BTW, is there a way to shorten the date by not showing the time?\nUPDATE: yes, as shown in example by "knittl" below: use --date=shortI use these two .gitconfig settings:%ad is the author date, which can be overidden by --date or the option specified in the [log] stanza in .gitconfig.\nI like the relative date because it gives an immediate feeling of when stuff was comitted.\nOutput looks like this:This is all of course in color, so it is easy to distinguish the various parts of a log line.\nAlso it is the default when typing git log because of the [format] section.2014 UPDATE:\nSince git now supports padding I have a nice amendment to the version above:This right aligns the relative dates and left aligns committer names, meaning you get a column-like look that is easy on the eyes.  2016 UPDATE: Since GPG commit signing is becoming a thing, I thought I\'d update this post with a version that includes signature verification (in the screenshot it\'s the magenta letter right after the commit). A short explanation of the flag:%G?: show "G" for a good (valid) signature, "B" for a bad signature, "U" for a good signature with unknown validity and "N" for no signature  Other changes include:Here\'s the config:All in all column alignment is now preserved a lot better at the expense of some (hopefully) useless characters.\nFeel free to edit if you have any improvements, I\'d love to make the message color depend on whether a commit is signed, but it doesn\'t seem like that is possible atm.use --date= to set a date formattig is a possible alternative to using the git log command, available on the major open source *nix distributions. On debian or ubuntu try installing and running as follows:(tig gets installed)(log is displayed in pager as follows, with current commit\'s hash displayed at the bottom)Since markdown doesn\'t support text coloring, imagine: column 1: blue; column 2: green; column 3: default text color. Last line, highlighted. Hit Q or q to exit. tig justifies the columns without ragged edges, which an ascii tab (%x09) doesn\'t guarantee. For a short date format hit capital D (note: lowercase d opens a diff view.) Configure it permanently by adding show-date = short to ~/.tigrc; or in a [tig] section in .git/configure or ~/.gitconfig.To see an entire change: Since tig is separate from git and apparently *nix specific, it probably requires cygwin to install on windows. But for fedora I believe the install commands are $ su, (enter root password), # yum install tig. For freebsd try % su,  (enter root password), # pkg_add -r tig.By the way, tig is good for a lot more than a quick view of the log: \nScreenshots &\nManualor...riffing on cdunn2001\'s answer above:  I\'d lose the author\'s e=mail and include just the author\'s name, as per Jesper and knittl, but in keeping with cdunn2001\'s idea of maintaining output in columns of constant width for ease of reading (great idea!). In lieu of a separate left justified column for author name, however, I wrap that flag at the end of the command with a parentheses or offset it with a pipe.  (Could really be any character that serves as a visual aid in reading the output...albeit might make sense to avoid back or forward slashes in order to reduce confusing the output with a directory or something.)  Sample output:Result:Constant-width stuff is first. The least important part -- the email domain -- is last and easy to filter.To show the commits I have staged that are ready to push I doThe output looks something like:Where the first column appears in yellow, and the \'H\' \'m\' and \'t\' in parentesis show the HEAD, master and trunk and appear in their usual "--decorate" colorsHere it is with line breaks so you can see what it\'s doing:I have aliased to "staged" with:(Is there an easier way to escape that? it was a bit tricky to work out what needed escaping)Use predefined git alias, i.e.:Created once by command:https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-AliasesAll aforementioned suggestions use %s placeholder for subject. I\'ll recommend to use %B because %s formatting preserves new lines and multiple lines commit message appears squashed.
