I\'m trying to use JS to turn a date object into a string in YYYYMMDD format.  Is there an easier way than concatenating Date.getYear(), Date.getMonth(), and Date.getDay()?Altered piece of code I often use:I didn\'t like adding to the prototype. An alternative would be:You can use the toISOString function :It will give you a "yyyy-mm-dd" format.\nBest regardsIf you don\'t need a pure JS solution, you can use jQuery UI to do the job like this :I usually don\'t like to import too much libraries. But jQuery UI is so useful, you will probably use it somewhere else in your project.Visit http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/ for more examplesThis is a single line of code that you can use to create a YYYY-MM-DD string of today\'s date.In addition to o-o\'s answer I\'d like to recommend separating logic operations from the return and put them as ternaries in the variables instead. Also, use concat() to ensure safe concatenation of variablesA bit more DRY fiddle as suggested by RiZKiThttps://jsfiddle.net/EricHerlitz/tuhhfxz9/I don\'t like modifying native objects, and I think multiplication is clearer than the string padding the accepted solution.Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/gbdarren/Ew7Y4/I ended up doingThis in response to @weberste\'s comment on @Pierre Guilbert\'s answer.This guy here => http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-format wrote a format() function for the Javascript\'s Date object, so it can be used with familiar literal formats.If you need full featured Date formatting in your app\'s Javascript, use it. Otherwise if what you want to do is a one off, then concatenating getYear(), getMonth(), getDay() is probably easiest.Little bit simplified version for the most popular answer in this thread https://stackoverflow.com/a/3067896/5437379 :Another way is to use toLocaleDateString with a locale that has a big-endian date format standard, such as Sweden, Lithuania, Hungary, South Korea, ...:To remove the delimiters (-) is just a matter of replacing the non-digits:This does not have the potential error you can get with UTC date formats: the UTC date may be one day off compared to the date in the local time zone.You can simply use This one line code to get date in yearIt seems that mootools provide Date().format() : http://mootools.net/docs/more/Native/DateI\'m not sure if it worth including just for this particular task though.Working from @o-o\'s answer this will give you back the string of the date according to a format string. You can easily add a 2 digit year regex for the year & milliseconds and the such if you need them.I don\'t know how efficient that is however, especially perf wise because it uses a lot of regex. It could probably use some work I do not master pure js.I usually use the code below when I need to do this.To explain, .slice(-2) gives us the last two characters of the string.So no matter what, we can add "0" to the day or month, and just ask for the last two since those are always the two we want.So if the MyDate.getMonth() returns 9, it will be:so adding .slice(-2) on that gives us the last two characters which is:But if date.getMonth() returns 10, it will be:so adding .slice(-2) gives us the last two characters, or:This code is fix to Pierre Guilbert\'s answer:(it works even after 10000 years)If you don\'t mind including an additional (but small) library, Sugar.js provides lots of nice functionality for working with dates in JavaScript.\nTo format a date, use the format function:dateformat is a very used package and I find it much more robust and easier to use than moment.js.How to use:Download and install dateformat from NPM. Require it in your module:var dateFormat = require(\'dateformat\');and then just format your stuff:var myYYYYmmddDate = dateformat(new Date(), \'yyyy-mm-dd\');If using AngularJs (up to 1.5) you can use the date filter:Here is a little improvement to the answer from https://stackoverflow.com/users/318563/o-oHope to be helpfull for anyone!:)function showdate(){this post helped me to write this helper, so I share it in case some one\nis looking for this solution, it supports all variations of yyyy, mm, ddHere is a more generic approach which allows both date and time components and is identically sortable as either number or string.Based on the number order of Date ISO format, convert to a local timezone and remove non-digits. i.e.:UsageDate.js has a lot of helpful date parsing methods.require("datejs")(new Date()).toString("yyyyMMdd")I try to write a simple library for manipulating JavaScript date object.
