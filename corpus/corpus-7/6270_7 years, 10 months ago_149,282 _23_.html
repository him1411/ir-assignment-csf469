I want to get all file names from a folder using Ruby.You also have the shortcut option of and if you want to find all Ruby files in any folder or sub-folder: example:Source: http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Dir.html#method-c-entriesThe following snippets exactly shows the name of the files inside a directory, skipping subdirectories and ".", ".." dotted folders:To get all files (strictly files only) recursively:Or anything that\'s not a directory (File.file? would reject non-regular files):Using Find#find over a pattern-based lookup method like Dir.glob is actually better.  See this answer to "One-liner to Recursively List Directories in Ruby?".Personally, I found this the most useful for looping over files in a folder, forward looking safety:This works for me:If you don\'t want hidden files[1], use Dir[]:Now, Dir.entries will return hidden files, and you don\'t need the wildcard asterix (you can just pass the variable with the directory name), but it will return the basename directly, so the File.xxx functions won\'t work.[1] .dotfile on unix, I don\'t know about WindowsThis is a solution to find files in a directory:While getting all the file names in a directory, this snippet can be used to reject both directories [., ..] and hidden files which start with a .returns file\'s relative paths from directory and all subdirectories If you want get an array of filenames including symlinks, useor even    and if you want to go without symlinks, useAs shown in other answers, use Dir.glob(\'/path/to/dir/**/*\') instead of Dir.new(\'/path/to/dir\') if you want to get all the files recursively.This is what works for me:Dir.entries returns an array of strings. Then, we have to provide a full path of the file to File.file?, unless dir is equal to our current working directory. That\'s why this File.join().
