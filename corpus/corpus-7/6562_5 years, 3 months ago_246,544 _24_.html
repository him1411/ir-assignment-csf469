I am working on an android project and I am using a spinner which uses an array adapter which is populated from the database. I can\'t find out how I can set the selected item programmatically from the list. For example if, in the spinner I have the following items:How would I programmatically make Category 2 the selected item when the screen is created. I was thinking it might be similar to c# I.E Spinner.SelectedText = "Category 2" but there doesn\'t seem to be any method similar to this for Android.Use the following:\nspinnerObject.setSelection(INDEX_OF_CATEGORY2).No one of these answers gave me the solution, only worked with this:You can use the above like:& of course you can also select by index directly likeSome explanation (at least for Fragments - never tried with pure Activity). Hope it helps someone to understand Android better.\nMost popular answer by Arun George is correct but don\'t work in some cases. The answer by Marco HC uses Runnable wich is a last resort due to additional CPU load.  The answer is - you should simply choose correct place to call to setSelection(), for example it works for me:But it won\'t work in onCreateView(). I suspect that is the reason for the interest to this topic.  \nThe secret is that with Android you can\'t do anything you want in any method - oops:( - components may just not be ready. As another example - you can\'t scroll ScrollView neither in onCreateView() nor in onResume() (see the answer here)To find a value and select it:Why don\'t you use your values from the DB and store them on an ArrayList and then just use:You can make a generic method for this kind of work as I do in my UtilityClass which isI have a SimpleCursorAdapter so I have to duplicate the data for use the respose in this post.  So, I recommend you try this way:I think that is a real wayYou can easily set like this: spinner.setSelection(1), instead of 1, you can set any position of list you would like to show.If you have a list of contacts the you can go for this:I know that is already answered, but simple code to select one item, very simple:This is work for me.In my case, this code saved my day:This worked for me:It\'s similar to @sberezin\'s solution but calling setSelection() in onStart().
