There was another thread about this, which I\'ve tried. But there is one problem: the textarea doesn\'t shrink if you delete the content. I can\'t find any way to shrink it to the correct size - the clientHeight value comes back as the full size of the textarea, not its contents.The code from that page is below. I\'d appreciate any help or pointers.This works for me (Firefox 3.6/4.0 and Chrome 10/11):If you want try it on jsfiddle\nIt starts with a single line and grows only the exact amount necessary. It is ok for a single textarea, but I wanted to write something where I would have many many many such textareas (about as much as one would normally have lines in a large text document). In that case it is really slow. (In Firefox it\'s insanely slow.) So I really would like an approach that uses pure CSS. This would be possible with contenteditable, but I want it to be plaintext-only.Updated 23/08/2017\n(Improved browser support for mobiles and tablets)The following code will work:This code requires jQuery and has been tested and is working with 1.7.2 - 3.2.1Simple (Add this jquery code to your master script file and forget about it.)Test on jsfiddleSimple (Add this JavaScript to your master script file and forget about it.)Test on jsfiddleUseful if you want to apply further chaining to the textareas you want to be auto-sized. Invoke with $(\'textarea\').autoHeight() When injecting content into a textarea via JavaScript append the following code to invoke the function in option 1.jQuery solution \nadjust the css to match your requirementscss...javascript...OR alternative for jQuery 1.7+...I\'ve created a fiddle with the absolute minimum styling as a starting point for your experiments...\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/53eAy/951/Tested in Firefox 14 and Chromium 18. The numbers 24 and 12 are arbitrary, test to see what suits you best.You could do without the style and script tags, but it becomes a bit messy imho (this is old style HTML+JS and is not encouraged).Edit: modernized code. Changed onkeyup attribute to addEventListener.\nEdit: keydown works better than keyup\nEdit: declare function before using\nEdit: input works better than keydown (thnx @WASD42 & @MA-Maddin)jsfiddleThe best solution (works and is short) for me is:It works like a charm without any blinking with paste (with mouse also), cut, entering and it shrinks to the right size.Please take a look at jsFiddle.You\'re using the higher value of the current clientHeight and the content scrollHeight. When you make the scrollHeight smaller by removing content, the calculated area can\'t get smaller because the clientHeight, previously set by style.height, is holding it open. You could instead take a max() of scrollHeight and a minimum height value you have predefined or calculated from textarea.rows.In general you probably shouldn\'t really rely on scrollHeight on form controls. Apart from scrollHeight being traditionally less widely-supported than some of the other IE extensions, HTML/CSS says nothing about how form controls are implemented internally and you aren\'t guaranteed scrollHeight will be anything meaningful. (Traditionally some browsers have used OS widgets for the task, making CSS and DOM interaction on their internals impossible.) At least sniff for scrollHeight/clientHeight\'s existance before trying to enable the effect.Another possible alternative approach to avoid the issue if it\'s important that it work more widely might be to use a hidden div sized to the same width as the textarea, and set in the same font. On keyup, you copy the text from the textarea to a text node in hidden div (remembering to replace \'\\n\' with a line break, and escape \'<\'/\'&\' properly if you\'re using innerHTML). Then simply measuring the div\'s offsetHeight will give you the height you need.If you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to support IE8 you can use the input event:Now you only need to add some CSS and you are done:Usage:You can read more about how it works on my blog post.The autosize jQuery plugin  just works, is popular (1.5k GitHub stars, cdnjs) and lightweight (~3k). Demo:As mentioned in a comment by @crispy, JQuery dependency has been removed on version 2 as of Feb 2015. TODO update the snippet.BTW, if you are using the ACE editor, use maxLines: Infinity: Automatically adjust height to contents in Ace Cloud9 editorI used the following code for multiple textareas. Working fine in Chrome 12, Firefox 5 and IE 9, even with delete, cut and paste actions performed in the textareas.Has anyone considered contenteditable? No messing around with scrolling,a nd the only JS I like about it is if you plan on saving the data on blur... and apparently, it\'s compatible on all of the popular browsers : http://caniuse.com/#feat=contenteditableJust style it to look like a text box, and it autosizes... Make its min-height the preferred text height and have at it.What\'s cool about this approach is that you can save  and  tags on some of the browsers.http://jsfiddle.net/gbutiri/v31o8xfo/A bit corrections. Works perfectly in OperaI know a short and correct way of implementing this with jquery.No extra hidden div needed and works in most browserThere is a slightly different approach.The idea is to copy the text from textarea into the pre and let CSS make sure that they have the same size.The benefit is that frameworks present simple tools to move text around without touching any events. Namely, in AngularJS you would add a ng-model="foo" ng-trim="false" to the textarea and ng-bind="foo + \'\\n\'" to the pre. See a fiddle.Just make sure that pre has the same font size as the textarea.Some of the answers here don\'t account for padding.Assuming you have a maxHeight you don\'t want to go over, this worked for me:I Don\'t know if anyone mention this way but in some cases it\'s possible to resize the height with rows AttributeDemoAn even simpler, cleaner approach is this: // and the CSSAll that is needed is to add the .auto-height class to any textarea you want to target.Tested in FF, Chrome and Safari. Let me know if this doesn\'t work for you, for any reason. But, this is the cleanest and simplest way I\'ve found this to work. And it works great! :DThis code works for pasting and select delete also. Here is the JSFiddleJust use <pre> </pre> with some styles like:The following works for cutting, pasting, etc., regardless of whether those actions are from the mouse, a keyboard shortcut, selecting an option from a menu bar ... several answers take a similar approach but they don\'t account for box-sizing, which is why they incorrectly apply the style overflow: hidden.I do the following, which also works well with max-height and rows for minimum and maximum height.For absolute completeness, you should call the adjust function in a few more circumstances:Note that using window.getComputedStyle or getting currentStyle can be somewhat computationally expensive, so you may want to cache the result instead.Works for IE6, so I really hope that\'s good enough support.Here is what I did while using MVC HTML Helper for TextArea.

Also supports cut and paste, long words, etc.You can use this piece of code to compute the number of rows a textarea needs:Compute it on input and window:resize events to get auto-resize effect. Example in Angular:Template code:auto-wrap.directive.tsHere is an angularjs directive for panzi\'s answer.HTML:I have tested script in common browsers, and it failed in Chrome and Safari. It is because of constantly updatable scrollHeight variable. I have applied DisgruntledGoat script using jQuery and added chrome fixI\'m able to set the TextArea size in IE9 and Chrome with the following jQuery function. It binds to the textarea objects from the selector defined in the $(document).ready() function. In my $(document).ready() function I have the following call for all of my textarea calls on this page.Where 250 is the character limit on my text area. This will grow as large as the text size will allow (based on your character count and font size). It will also shrink your text area appropriately when you remove characters from your textarea or if the user pastes too much text initially.I recommend the javascript library from http://javierjulio.github.io/textarea-autosize.Per comments, add example codeblock on plugin usage:Minimum required CSS:If scrollHeight could be trusted, then:
