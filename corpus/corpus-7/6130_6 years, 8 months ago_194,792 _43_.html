I\'m trying to learn about new usages of javascript as a serverside language and as a functional language. Few days ago I heard about node.js and express framework. Then I saw about underscore.js as a set of utility functions. I saw this question on stackoverflow\n. It says we can use underscore.js as a template engine. anybody know good tutorials about how to use underscore.js for templating, especially for biginners who have less experience with advanced javascript. Thanks Everything you need to know about underscore template is here. Only 3 things to keep in mind:That\'s all about it.Simple example:then tpl({foo: "blahblah"}) would be rendered to the string <h1>Some text: blahblah</h1>In it\'s simplest form you would use it like:If you\'re going to be using a template a few times you\'ll want to compile it so it\'s faster:I personally prefer the Mustache style syntax. You can adjust the template token markers to use double curly braces:The documentation for templating is partial, I watched the source.The _.template function has 3 arguments:If no data (or null) given, than a render function will be returned. It has 1 argument: There are 3 regex patterns and 1 static parameter in the settings:  The code in an evaluate section will be simply evaluated. You can add string from this section with the __p+="mystring" command to the evaluated template, but this is not recommended (not part of the templating interface), use the interpolate section instead of that. This type of section is for adding blocks like if or for to the template.The result of the code in the interpolate section will added to the evaluated template. If null given back, then empty string will added.The escape section escapes html with _.escape on the return value of the given code. So its similar than an _.escape(code) in an interpolate section, but it escapes with \\ the whitespace characters like \\n before it passes the code to the _.escape. I don\'t know why is that important, it\'s in the code, but it works well with the interpolate and _.escape - which doesn\'t escape the white-space characters - too.By default the data parameter is passed by a with(data){...} statement, but this kind of evaluating is much slower than the evaluating with named variable. So naming the data with the variable parameter is something good...For example:resultsYou can find here more examples how to use the template and override the default settings:\nhttp://underscorejs.org/#templateBy template loading you have many options, but at the end you always have to convert the template into string. You can give it as normal string like the example above, or you can load it from a script tag, and use the .html() function of jquery, or you can load it from a separate file with the tpl plugin of require.js.Another option to build the dom tree with laconic instead of templating.I am giving a very simple example1)  The result would be2) This is a templateThis is htmlThis is the javascript code which contains json object and putting template into htmlwith express it\'s so easy. all what you need is to use the consolidate module on node so you need to install it :then you should change the default engine to html template by this:register the underscore template engine for the html extension:it\'s done !Now for load for example an template called \'index.html\':maybe you will need to install the underscore module.I hope this helped you!I wanted to share one more important finding.use of <%= variable => would result in cross-site scripting vulnerability. So its more safe to use <%- variable -> instead.We had to replace <%= with <%- to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. Not sure, whether this will it have any impact on the performanceLodash is also the same \nFirst write a script as follows:Now write some simple JS as follows:Where popoup is a div where you want to generate the table
