What is a JavaScript or jQuery solution that will select all of the contents of a textbox when the textbox receives focus?This is not just a Chrome/Safari issue, I experienced a quite similar behavior with Firefox 18.0.1. The funny part is that this does not happen on MSIE! The problem here is the first mouseup event that forces to unselect the input content, so just ignore the first occurence.The timeOut approach causes a strange behavior, and blocking every mouseup event you can not remove the selection clicking again on the input element.U mad guys... Jquery is not JavaScript whitch is more easy to use in some cases.Look at this example:from Css tricsmy solution is to use a timeout. Seems to work okThis will also work on iOS:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/selectThe answers here helped me up to a point, but I had a problem on HTML5 Number input fields when clicking the up/down buttons in Chrome.If you click one of the buttons, and left the mouse over the button the number would keep changing as if you were holding the mouse button because the mouseup was being thrown away.I solved this by removing the mouseup handler as soon as it had been triggered as below:Hope this helps people in the future...I know inline code is bad style, but I didn\'t want to put this into a .js file.\nWorks without jQuery!This will work, Try this - Works in Safari/IE 9 and Chrome, I did not get a chance to test in Firefox though.I was able to slightly improve Zach\'s answer by incorporating a few function calls. The problem with that answer is that it disables onMouseUp completely, thereby preventing you from clicking around in the textbox once it has focus.Here is my code:This is a slight improvement over Zach\'s answer. It works perfectly in IE, doesn\'t work at all in Chrome, and works with alternating success in FireFox (literally every other time). If someone has an idea of how to make it work reliably in FF or Chrome, please share. Anyway, I figured I\'d share what I could to make this a little nicer.Like @Travis and @Mari, I wanted to autoselect when the user clicked in, which means preventing the default behaviour of a mouseup event, but not prevent the user from clicking around. The solution I came up with, which works in IE11, Chrome 45, Opera 32 and Firefox 29 (these are the browsers I currently have installed), is based on the sequence of events involved in a mouse click.When you click on a text input that does not have focus, you get these events (among others):When you click on a text input that already has focus, the focus event is skipped. As @Travis and @Mari both astutely noticed, the default handling of mouseup needs to be prevented only if the focus event occurs. However, as there is no "focus didn\'t happen" event, we need to infer this, which we can do within the mousedown handler.@Mari\'s solution requires that jQuery be imported, which I want to avoid. @Travis\'s solution does this by inspecting document.activeElement. I don\'t know why exactly his solution doesn\'t work across browsers, but there is another way to track whether the text input has focus: simply follow its focus and blur events.Here is the code that works for me:I hope this is of help to someone. :-)I know there are already a lot of answers here - but this one is missing so far; a solution which also works with ajax generated content:What is a JavaScript or jQuery solution that will select all of the contents of a textbox when the textbox receives focus?You only need to add the following attribute:For example:(Honestly I have no clue why you would need anything else.)Edit: Per @DavidG\'s request, I can\'t provide details because I\'m not sure why this works, but I believe it has something to do with the focus event propagating up or down or whatever it does and the input element getting the notification it\'s received focus. Setting the timeout gives the element a moment to realize it\'s done so.If you chain the events together I believe it eliminates the need to use .one as suggested elsewhere in this thread.Example:Note: If you are programming in ASP.NET, you can run the script using ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript in C#: Or just type the script in the HTML page suggested in the other answers. HTML : Using JS :Using JQuery :Using React Js :In the respective component inside render function -In the same component with your function -I sow this one some where , work perfectly !This worked for me (posting since it is not in answers but in a comment)My solution is next:So mouseup will work usually, but will not make unselect after getting focus by input
