[] = empty list() = empty tuple{} = empty dictIs there a similar notation for an empty set?\nOr do I have to write set()?No, there\'s no literal syntax for the empty set. You have to write set().Just to extend the accepted answer:From version 2.7 and 3.1 python has got set literal {} in form of usage {1,2,3}, but {} itself still used for empty dict.Python 2.7 (first line is invalid in Python <2.7)Python 3.xMore here: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html#other-language-changesIt depends on if you want the literal for a comparison, or for assignment.If you want to make an existing set empty, you can use the .clear() metod, especially if you want to avoid creating a new object.  If you want to do a comparison, use set() or check if the length is 0.example:if you want to initialize empty set then apply below code. this one is works perfectly for me in python 3:Adding to the crazy ideas: with Python 3 accepting unicode identifiers, you could declare a variable \xcf\x95 = frozenset() (\xcf\x95 is U+03D5) and use it instead.use it like this\na = setora = {0,1}
