How to change the font in a TextView, as default it\'s shown up as Arial? How to change it to Helvetica?First, the default is not Arial. The default is Droid Sans.Second, to change to a different built-in font, use android:typeface in layout XML or setTypeface() in Java.Third, there is no Helvetica font in Android. The built-in choices are Droid Sans (sans), Droid Sans Mono (monospace), and Droid Serif (serif). While you can bundle your own fonts with your application and use them via setTypeface(), bear in mind that font files are big and, in some cases, require licensing agreements (e.g., Helvetica, a Linotype font).EDITThe Android design language relies on traditional typographic tools\n  such as scale, space, rhythm, and alignment with an underlying grid.\n  Successful deployment of these tools is essential to help users\n  quickly understand a screen of information. To support such use of\n  typography, Ice Cream Sandwich introduced a new type family named\n  Roboto, created specifically for the requirements of UI and\n  high-resolution screens.The current TextView framework offers Roboto in thin, light, regular\n  and bold weights, along with an italic style for each weight. The\n  framework also offers the Roboto Condensed variant in regular and bold\n  weights, along with an italic style for each weight.After ICS, android includes Roboto fonts style,\nRead more RobotoFirst download the .ttf file of the font you need (arial.ttf). Place it in the  assets  folder(Inside assets folder create new folder named fonts and place it inside it). If txtyour is the textviews you want to apply the font , use the following piece of code,You might want to create static class which will contain all the fonts. That way, you won\'t create the font multiple times which might impact badly on performance.\nJust make sure that you create a sub-folder called "fonts" under "assets" folder.Do something like:This way, you can get the font from everywhere in your application.The answers above are correct. Just make sure that you create a sub-folder called "fonts" under "assets" folder if you are using that piece of code.TextViewPlus.java:attrs.xml: (Where to place res/values)How to use:Hope this will help you.Another way to consolidate font creation...And then to use in your activity...Mind you, this double-checked locking idiom with the volatile field only works correctly with the memory model used in Java 1.5+.It\'s a little old, but I improved the class CustomFontLoader a little bit and I wanted to share it so it can be helpfull. Just create a new class with this code.Then just use this code on you textview:STEP 1: add font fileFor example, when font file will be helvetica_neue.ttf that will generates R.font.helvetica_neueSTEP 2: create font familyFor example:STEP 3: use itIn xml layouts:Or add fonts to style:For more examples you can follow documentation:Working with fontsThis way, you can create a View which inherits from TextView and calls setTypeface on its constructor.get font from  asset and set to all childrenadd to attrs.xml ,\nThe numbers should be in the order in array class. Maybe something a bit simpler:(Note this code is untested, but in general this approach should work well.)
