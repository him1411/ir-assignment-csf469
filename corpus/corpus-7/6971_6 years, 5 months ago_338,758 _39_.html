I thought this would be easy to achieve, but so far I haven\'t found solutions for comment/uncomment shortcut on both Java class editor and jsf faceted webapp XHTML file editor :For example :single line java code, from :intomultiple line java code, from :intosingle line xhtml code, from :intomultiple line xhtml code, from :intoFor single line comment you can use Ctrl + / and for multiple line comment you can use Ctrl + Shift + / after selecting the lines you want to comment in java editor.On Mac/OS X you can use \xe2\x8c\x98 + / to comment out single lines or selected blocks.UseCtrl + SHIFT + L which will open a list of all major shortcuts for eclipse.For single line java code comment : Ctrl + / (Forwards\nSlash) and Single line uncomment : Ctrl + \\ (Backslash)For multiple line java code comment : Ctrl + Shift +\n/ (Forwards Slash) andMultiline uncomment : Ctrl + Shift +\n\\ (Backslash)For single line xhtml code comment/uncomment : Ctrl + Shift +\ncFor multiple line xhtml code comment : Ctrl + Shift +\n/ (Forwards Slash)For multiple uncomment : Ctrl + Shift +\n\\ (Backward Slash)For Mac user it will be: \xe2\x8c\x98 instead of CtrlCTRL + 7does comment/uncomment in the Java Editor.  An easier way is to press Ctrl + Shift + C, just like in Code::BlocksSelect the code you want to comment, then use Ctr + / to comment and Ctrl + \\ to uncomment. It may not work for all types of source files, but it works great for Java code.In eclipse Pressing Ctrl + Shift + L, will list all the shortcuts. Ctrl  + Shift + C . Works great on .java, .xhtml, .properties and maybe on others but I only tested these ones. Can comment single or multiple lines. Ctrl  + 7  to comment a selected text.A simple way of doing is to press Ctrl + Shift + C, on the lines of your code.For comment and for uncomment do same .. :)For a Mac it is the following combination: Cmd + /Single comment ctrl + / and also multiple line comment you can select multiple line and then ctrl + /. Then, to remove comment you can use ctrl + c for both single line and multiple line comment.You can toggle the comment on one line or selection by using the shortcut Ctrl + /\nThis adds/removes the // infront of the code lineYou can block comment /*  */ using the Ctrl + Shift + / eclipse shortcutYou can find a complete list of useful eclipse shortcuts here http://javatutorial.net/eclipse-shortcutsCtrl+/ to toggle "//" comments and Ctrl+Shift/ to toggle "/* */" comments. At least for Java, anyway - other tooling may have different shortcuts.Ctrl+\\ will remove a block of either comment, but won\'t add comments.EDIT: It\'s Ctrl on a PC, but on a Mac the shortcuts may all be Cmd instead. I don\'t have a Mac myself, so can\'t easily check
