I am using windows 7 and xp. I want to know the uptime of the system.What is the command / procedure for getting the uptime?Following are seven ways to find the Uptime in Windows OS.In Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the Task Manager has been beefed up to show additional information about the system. One of these pieces of info is the server\xe2\x80\x99s running time.The current system uptime is shown under System or Performance â‡’ CPU for Win 8/10.The systeminfo command line utility checks and displays various system statistics such as installation date, installed hotfixes and more.\nOpen a Command Prompt and type the following command:You can also narrow down the results to just the line you need:Microsoft have published a tool called Uptime.exe. It is a simple command line tool that analyses the computer\'s reliability and availability information. It can work locally or remotely. In its simple form, the tool will display the current system uptime. An advanced option allows you to access more detailed information such as shutdown, reboots, operating system crashes, and Service Pack installation.Read the following KB for more info and for the download links:  To use it, follow these steps:It does not offer many command line parameters:There is an older version of the "uptime.exe" utility. This has the advantage of NOT needing .NET. (It also has a lot more features beyond simple uptime.)Download link: Windows NT 4.0 Server Uptime Tool (uptime.exe) (final x86)\nAnother easy method, if you can remember it, is to use the approximate information found in the statistics displayed by the NET STATISTICS command.\nOpen a Command Prompt and type the following command:The statistics should tell you how long it\xe2\x80\x99s been running, although in some cases this information is not as accurate as other methods.Probably the most accurate of them all, but it does require some clicking. It does not display an exact day or hour count since the last reboot, but it will display important information regarding why the computer was rebooted and when it did so. We need to look at Event ID 6005, which is an event that tells us that the computer has just finished booting, but you should be aware of the fact that there are virtually hundreds if not thousands of other event types that you could potentially learn from.Note: BTW, the 6006 Event ID is what tells us when the server has gone down, so if there\xe2\x80\x99s much time difference between the 6006 and 6005 events, the server was down for a long time.Note: You can also open the Event Viewer by typing eventvwr.msc in the Run command, and you might as well use the shortcut found in the Administrative tools folder.GetTickCount64 retrieves the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system was started.Like the tool from Microsoft, but compatible with all operating systems up to and including Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, this uptime utility does not require an elevated command prompt and offers an option to show the uptime in both DD:HH:MM:SS and in human-readable formats (when executed with the -h command-line parameter). Additionally, this version of uptime.exe will run and show the system uptime even when launched normally from within an explorer.exe session (i.e. not via the command line) and pause for the uptime to be read:and when executed as uptime -h:I use this little PowerShell snippet:which then yields something like the following:Two ways to do that..Option 1:Option 2:Uptime.exe Tool Allows You to Estimate Server Availability with Windows NT 4.0 SP4 or Higherhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/232243Hope it helped you!!
