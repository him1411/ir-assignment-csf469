I\'ve to detect if two time periods are overlapping.Every period has a start date and an end date.I need to detect if my first time period (A) is overlapping with another one(B/C).In my case, if the start of B is equal to the end of A, they are not overlapping(the inverse too)I found the following cases:So actually I\'m doing this like this:(The case 4 is taken in account either in case 1 or in case 2)It works, but it seems not very efficient.So, first is there an existing class in c# that can modelize this(a time period), something like a timepsan, but with a fixed start date.Secondly: Is there already a c# code(like in the Datetime class) which can handle this?Third: if no, what would be your approach to make this comparison the most fast?Simple check to see if two time periods overlap:or in your code:(Use <= instead of < if you change your mind about wanting to say that two periods that just touch each other overlap.)There is a wonderful library with good reviews on CodeProject: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/168662/Time-Period-Library-for-NETThat library does a lot of work concerning overlap, intersecting them, etc. It\'s too big to copy/paste all of it, but I\'ll see which specific parts which can be useful to you.You can create a reusable Range pattern class  :You can add all methods you need to merge ranges, get intersections and so on...I\'m building a booking system and found this page. I\'m interested in range intersection only, so I built this structure; it is enough to play with DateTime ranges.You can check Intersection and check if a specific date is in range, and get the\nintersection type and the most important: you can get intersected Range.How about a custom interval-tree structure? You\'ll have to tweak it a little bit to define what it means for two intervals to "overlap" in your domain.This question might help you find an off-the-shelf interval-tree implementation in C#.I don\'t believe that the framework itself has this class. Maybe a third-party library...But why not create a Period value-object class to handle this complexity? That way you can ensure other constraints, like validating start vs end datetimes. Something like:That way you will be able to individually compare each period... This code checks if two intervals overlap.Algorithm:example 12:00 - 12:30 is not overlapping with 12:30 13:00Distrubution logicThanks for the above answers which help me code the above for an MVC project.Note StartDateDT and EndDateDT are dateTime typesTry this.  This method will determine if (two) date spans are overlapping, regardless of the ordering of the method\'s input arguments.  This can also be used with more than two date spans, by individually checking each date span combination (ex. with 3 date spans, run span1 against span2, span2 against span3, and span1 against span3):Test:
