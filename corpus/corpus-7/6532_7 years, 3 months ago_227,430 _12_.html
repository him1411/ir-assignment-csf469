What are some of the best ways to create a GUID in Java?Have a look at the UUID class bundled with Java 5 and later. For example:java.util.UUID.randomUUID();It depends what kind of UUID you want.The standard Java UUID class generates Version 4 (random) UUIDs.  (UPDATE - Version 3 (name) UUIDs can also be generated.) It can also handle other variants, though it cannot generate them.  (In this case, "handle" means construct UUID instances from long, byte[] or String representations, and provide some appropriate accessors.)The Java UUID Generator (JUG) implementation purports to support "all 3 \'official\' types of UUID as defined by RFC-4122" ... though the RFC actually defines 4 types and mentions a 5th type.For more information on UUID types and variants, there is a good summary in Wikipedia, and the gory details are in RFC 4122 and the other specifications.The other Answers are correct, especially this one by Stephen C.Generating a UUID value within Java is limited to Version 4 (random) because of security concerns. If you want other versions of UUIDs, one avenue is to have your Java app reach outside the JVM to generate UUIDs by calling on:Just to extend Mark Byers\'s answer with an example:
