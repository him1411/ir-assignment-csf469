I have recently installed a recent community version of MySQL from MySQL site. The version is 5.6.x.It was done using an installer and I also chose the option to create a MySQL service on Windows so that I can simply start the service. The service was set to not start automatically. Although I am not actively using MySQL, while I am working on my PC on something else, a strange pop-up displays, "MySQL Running in community mode.", does something, prints on screen, and closes:I am surprised to see this and wonder: what is it doing - connecting to a remote server and doing what? Does someone know the internals and how to prevent it from connecting to a remote server?Could this be a security issue?Go to Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools and open Task Scheduler.In the Task Scheduler navigate to Task Scheduler Library > MySQL and select Installer.From the list at the center of the window right-click ManifestUpdate and select Disable.Answer found here.Since the other answers require OS interaction I figured it would be beneficial to provide the "MySQL" way.I am surprised to see and wonder what is it doing and connecting to a\n  remote server and doing what?It\'s keeping the MySQL Product Catalog up to date. As described in the documentation, This option uses the Windows Task Scheduler to schedule a task named\n  "ManifestUpdate". (this is the scheduled task that is disabled the OS way)Does someone know the internals and how to prevent it from connecting\n  to a remote server?To prevent it from connecting you can disable it without going through the OS:You\'re ready to go...This could be a security issue?I\'m not a security expert but it\'s connecting to the same people you trusted to get the software from so I think it\'s more of a nuisance than a risk. Luckily, you can manually update it as needed by clicking the Catalog... button seen above and force it.It\'s just the MySQL update function.Following these http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/what-is-taskengexe/526f43d3-d311-4637-a19a-a76f1ce351fb you should be able to turn it off:From an answer by Liza.Z on question "What is taskeng.exe?" on http://answers.microsoft.com/, written April 23, 2013 retrieved Feb. 22, 2016It may be better not to completely disable the updater but make it check less often than once a day, which seems over the top. You can not do that without using the Task Scheduler. Double-click the "ManifestUpdate" Name in the Task Scheduler to open the Properties window and select the Triggers tab, here you can use the "Edit..." button to set the task to run as [in]frequently as you like. This is what I have done:Be warned that the next MySQL update you do decide to install might undo anything done directly in the Task Scheduler.
