I have an select box:I\'d like to set one of the options as "selected" based on it\'s selected index.For example, if I am trying to set "Number 3", I\'m trying this:But this doesn\'t work.  How can I set an option as selected based on it\'s index using jQuery?Thanks!NOTE: answer is dependent upon jQuery 1.6.1+Thanks for the comment, .get won\'t work since it returns a DOM element, not a jQuery one. Keep in mind the .eq function can be used outside of the selector as well if you prefer.You can also be more terse/readable if you want to use the value, instead of relying on selecting a specific index:Note: .val(3) works as well for this example, but non-numeric values must be strings, so I chose a string for consistency. \n(e.g. <option value="hello">Number3</option> requires you to use .val("hello"))This may also be useful, so I thought I\'d add it here. If you would like to select a value based on the item\'s value and not the index of that item then you can do the following:Your select list:The jquery:The selected item would be "Number 2" now.Try this instead:also, see if this helps you: http://elegantcode.com/2009/07/01/jquery-playing-with-select-dropdownlistcombobox/Even simpler:when you want to select with top ways for set selection , you can use\n$(\'#select option\').removeAttr(\'selected\'); for remove previous selects . What\'s important to understand is that val() for a select element returns the value of the selected option, but not the number of element as does selectedIndex in javascript.To select the option with value="7" you can simply use:To deselect the option use an empty array:And of course you can select multiple options*:*However to select multiple options, your <select> element must have a MULTIPLE attribute, otherwise it won\'t work.Try this:Eventually, trigger a .change event :I\'ve always had issues with prop(\'selected\'), the following has always worked for me:Hope this could help TooTo clarify Marc\'s and John Kugelman\'s answers, you could use:get() will not work if used in the way specified because it gets the DOM object, not a jQuery object, so the following solution will not work:eq() gets filters the jQuery set to that of the element with the specified index. It\'s  clearer than $($(\'#selectBox  option\').get(3)). It\'s not all that efficient. $($(\'#selectBox option\')[3]) is more efficient (see test case).You don\'t actually need the jQuery object though. This will do the trick:http://api.jquery.com/get/http://api.jquery.com/eq/The attribute "selected" is not how you specify a selected radio button (in Firefox and Chrome at least). Use the "checked" attribute:The same goes for check-boxes.In 1.4.4 you get an error:  $("#selectBox option")[3].attr is not a functionThis works: $(\'#name option:eq(idx)\').attr(\'selected\', true);Where #name is select id and idx is the option value you want selected.The pure javascript selectedIndex attribute is the right way to go because,it\'s pure javascript and works cross-browser:Here is a jsfiddle demo with two dropdowns using one to set the other:You can also call this before changing the selectedIndex if what you want is the "selected" attribute on the option tag (here is the fiddle):NB: is incorrect, the array deference gets you the dom object, not a jquery object, so it will fail with a TypeError, for instance in FF with: "$(\'#selectBox option\')[3].attr() not a function."select 3rd optionExample on jsfiddleWhen using the above I kept getting errors in webkit (Chrome) saying: "Uncaught TypeError: Object # has no method \'attr\'"This syntax stops those errors. Select the item based on the value in the select list (especially if the option values have a space or weird character in it) by simply doing this:Also, if you have a dropdown (as opposed to a multi-select) you may want to do a break; so you don\'t get the first-value-found to be overwritten.I need a solution that has no hard coded values in the js file; using selectedIndex. Most of the given solutions failed one browser. This appears to work in FF10 and IE8 (can someone else test in other versions)If you just want to select an item based of a particular property of an item then jQuery option of type[prop=val] will get that item. Now I don\'t care about the index I just wanted the item by its value.I faced same problem. \nFirst you need go through the events (i.e which event is happening first).For example: The First event  is generating select box with options. The Second event is selecting default option using any function such as val() etc.You should ensure that the Second event should happen after the First event.To achieve this take two functions lets say generateSelectbox() (for genrating select box) and selectDefaultOption()You need to ensure that selectDefaultOption() should be called only after the execution of generateSelectbox()You can also init multiple values if your selectbox is a multipl:you can  set selectoption variable  value dynamically as well as option will be selected.You can try following codecode:HTML CODE:Shortly:$("#selectBox").attr("selectedIndex",index)where index is the selected index as integer.
