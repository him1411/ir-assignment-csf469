table1 (id, name)\n  table2 (id, name)Query:Q: What is happening here?A: Conceptually, we select all rows from table1 and for each row we attempt to find a row in table2 with the same value for the name column. If there is no such row, we just leave the table2 portion of our result empty for that row. Then we constrain our selection by picking only those rows in the result where the matching row does not exist. Finally, We ignore all fields from our result except for the name column (the one we are sure that exists, from table1).While it may not be the most performant method possible in all cases, it should work in basically every database engine ever that attempts to implement ANSI 92 SQLorSee this question for 3 techniques to accomplish thisI don\'t have enough rep points to vote up the 2nd answer. But I have to disagree with the comments on the top answer. The second answer:Is FAR more efficient in practice. I don\'t know why, but I\'m running it against 800k+ records and the difference is tremendous with the advantage given to the 2nd answer posted above. Just my $0.02This is pure set theory which you can achieve with the minus operation. Watch out for pitfalls. If the field Name in Table1 contain Nulls you are in for surprises.\nBetter is:You can use EXCEPT in mssql or MINUS in oracle, they are identical according to :http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2008/08/07/sql-server-except-clause-in-sql-server-is-similar-to-minus-clause-in-oracle/Here\'s what worked best for me.This was more than twice as fast as any other method I tried.That work sharp for me
