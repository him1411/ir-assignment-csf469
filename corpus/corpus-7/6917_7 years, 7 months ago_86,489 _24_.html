What is the non-jQuery equivalent of $(document).ready()?The nice thing about $(document).ready() is that it fires before window.onload. The load function waits until everything is loaded, including external assets and images. $(document).ready, however, fires when the DOM tree is complete and can be manipulated. If you want to acheive DOM ready, without jQuery, you might check into this library. Someone extracted just the ready part from jQuery. Its nice and small and you might find it useful:domready at Google CodeThis works perfectly, from ECMAThe window.onload dosen\'t equal to JQuery $(document).ready because JQuery waits only to the DOM tree while Vanilla JS check all elements including external assets and images.EDIT: Added IE8 and older equivalent, thanks to Jan Derk\'s observation. You may read the source of this code on MDN at this link:There are other options apart from "interactive". See the MDN link for details.A little thing I put togetherdomready.jsHow to use itYou can also change the context in which the callback runs by passing a second argumentThere is a standards based replacement,DOMContentLoaded that is supported by over 90%+ of browsers, but not IE8 (So below code use by JQuery for browser support):jQuery\'s native function is much more complicated than just window.onload, as depicted below.In plain vanilla JavaScript, with no libraries? It\'s an error. $ is simply an identifier, and is undefined unless you define it.jQuery defines $ as it\'s own "everything object" (also known as jQuery so you can use it without conflicting with other libraries). If you\'re not using jQuery (or some other library that defines it), then $ will not be defined.Or are you asking what the equivalent is in plain JavaScript? In that case, you probably want window.onload, which isn\'t exactly equivalent, but is the quickest and easiest way to get close to the same effect in vanilla JavaScript.The body onLoad could be an alternative too:The easiest way in recent browsers would be to use the js event onDOMContentLoaded:The DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading. A very different event load should be used only to detect a fully-loaded page. It is an incredibly popular mistake to use load where DOMContentLoaded would be much more appropriate, so be cautious.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoadedThe function used is an IIFE, very useful on this case:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expressionI don\'t think JavaScript has that function built in. It is jQuery specific.
