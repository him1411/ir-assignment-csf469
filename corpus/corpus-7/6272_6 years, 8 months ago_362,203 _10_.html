This question already has an answer here:How do I do this? I want my element to look as though it has a shadow underline. I dont want the shadow for the other 3 sidesDo this:                    its actually much simpler, what ever you set the blur to (3rd value), set the spread (4th value) to the negative of it.You can use two elements, one inside the other, and give the outer one overflow: hidden and a width equal to the inner element together with a bottom padding so that the shadow on all the other sides are "cut off"Alternatively, float the outer element to cause it to shrink to the size of the inner element. See: http://jsfiddle.net/QJPd5/1/Try this You can see it in http://jsfiddle.net/wJ7qp/try this to get the box-shadow under your full control.this would apply to outer box-shadow as well.
