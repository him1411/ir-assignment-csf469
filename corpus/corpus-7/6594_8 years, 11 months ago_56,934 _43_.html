We are logging any exceptions that happen in our system by writing the Exception.Message to a file. However, they are written in the culture of the client. And Turkish errors don\'t mean a lot to me.So how can we log any error messages in English without changing the users culture?This issue can be partially worked around. The Framework exception code loads the error messages from its resources, based on the current thread locale. In the case of some exceptions, this happens at the time the Message property is accessed.For those exceptions, you can obtain the full US English version of the message by briefly switching the thread locale to en-US while logging it (saving the original user locale beforehand and restoring it immediately afterwards).Doing this on a separate thread is even better: this ensures there won\'t be any side effects. For example:Where the ExceptionLogger class looks something like:However, as Joe correctly points out in a comment on an earlier revision of this reply, some messages are already (partially) loaded from the language resources at the time the exception is thrown.This applies to the \'parameter cannot be null\' part of the message generated when an ArgumentNullException("foo") exception is thrown, for example. In those cases, the message will still appear (partially) localized, even when using the above code.Other than by using impractical hacks, such as running all your non-UI code on a thread with en-US locale to begin with, there doesn\'t seem to be much you can do about that: the .NET Framework exception code has no facilities for overriding the error message locale.You can search for the original exception message at unlocalize.comA contentious point perhaps, but instead of setting the culture to en-US, you can set it to Invariant. In the Invariant culture, the error messages are in English.It has the advantage of not looking biased, especially for non-American English speaking locales. (a.k.a. avoids snide remarks from colleagues)Along these lines, I still am not comfortable with the design of errors in .net. It\'s exception classes and events, with text descriptions. You discover the error based on the exception class thrown, and the text description of the error. There are usually no numeric error codes (unless they are buried within an inner system exception) that you can look up in a well defined list of errors. Why wouldn\'t that be simpler?I would imagine one of these approaches:1) The exceptions are only ever read by you, i.e. they are not a client feature, so you can use hardwired non localised strings that won\'t change when you run in turkish mode. 2) Include an error code eg. 0X00000001 with each error so that you can easily look it in up in an english table.Windows needs to have the UI language you want to use installed. It it doesn\'t, it has no way of magically knowing what the translated message is.In an en-US windows 7 ultimate, with pt-PT installed, the following code:Produces messages in pt-PT, en-US and en-US. Since there is no French culture files installed, it defaults to the windows default (installed?) language.Here is solution that does not require any coding, and may not be always applicable in every case (it depends on your setup as you need to be able to create a .config file aside the main .exe file) but that works for me. So, just create an app.config in dev, (or a [myapp].exe.config or web.config in production) that contains the following lines for example:What this does is tell the framework to redirect assembly bindings for mscorlib\'s resources and System.Xml\'s resources, for versions between 1 and 999, in french (culture is set to "fr") to an assembly that ... does not exists (an arbitrary version 999).So when the CLR will look for french resources for these two assemblies (mscorlib and System.xml), it will not find them and fallback to English gracefully. Depending on your context and testings, you might want to add other assemblies to these redirects (assemblies that contains localized resources).Of course I don\'t think this is supported by Microsoft, so use at your own risk. Well, in case you detect a problem, you can just remove this configuration and check it\'s unrelated.I know this is an old topic, but I think my solution may be quite relevant to anyone who stumbles across it in a web search:In the exception logger you could log ex.GetType.ToString, which would save the name of the exception class.  I would expect that the name of a class ought to be independent of language and would therefore always be represented in English (e.g. "System.FileNotFoundException"), though at present I don\'t have access to a foreign language system to test out the idea.If you really want the error message text as well you could create a dictionary of all possible exception class names and their equivalent messages in whatever language you prefer, but for English I think the class name is perfectly adequate.The .NET framework comes in two parts:All texts (ex. exception messages, button labels on a MessageBox, etc.) are in English in the .NET framework itself. The language packs have the localized texts.Depending on your exact situation, a solution would be to uninstall the language packs (i.e. tell the client to do so). In that case, the exception texts will be in English. Note however, that all other framework-supplied text will be English as well (ex. the button labels on a MessageBox, keyboard shortcuts for ApplicationCommands).Setting Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture will be used to localize the exceptions. If you need two kinds of exceptions (one for the user, one for you) you can use following function to translate the exception-message. It\'s searching in the .NET-Libraries resources for the orignal text to get the resource-key and then returns the translated value. But there one weakness I didn\'t find a good solution yet: Messages, that contains {0} in resources will not be found. If anyone have a good solution I would be grateful.Without WORKAROUNDS.Tks :)You should log the call stack instead of just error message (IIRC, simple exception.ToString() should do that for you). From there, you can determine exactly where the exception originated from, and usually deduce which exception it is.Override exception message in catch block using extension method, Check thrown message is from code or not as mentioned below.For Logging purposes, certain applications may need to fetch the English exception message (besides displaying it in the usual client\'s UICulture). For that purpose, the following code and then finally changes the current UICulture back to earlier UICulture.I have had the same situation, and all answers that I found here and elsewhere did not help or were not satisfying:\nForce exceptions language in English\nC# - Getting Exception messages in English when the application is in another language?\nHow to change Visual Studio exception message language to English while debugging\nHow to handle translation of exception message?\nHow to completely avoid localized .NET exception messages The Thread.CurrentUICulture changes the language of the .net exceptions, but it does not for Win32Exception, which uses Windows resources in the language of the Windows UI itself. So I never managed to print the messages of Win32Exception in English instead of German, not even by using FormatMessage() as described in\nHow to get Win32Exception in English?Therefore I created my own solution, which stores the majority of existing exception messages for different languages in external files. You will not get the very exact message in your desired language, but you will get a message in that language, which is much more than you currently get (which is a message in a language you likely don\'t understand).  The static functions of this class can be executed on Windows installations with different languages:\nCreateMessages() creates the culture-specific texts\nSaveMessagesToXML() saves them to as many XML files as languages are created or loaded\nLoadMessagesFromXML() loads all XML files with language-specific messages  When creating the XML files on different Windows installations with different languages, you will soon have all languages you need.\nMaybe you can create the texts for different languages on 1 Windows when you have multiple MUI language packs installed, but I haven\'t tested that yet.Tested with VS2008, ready to use.
