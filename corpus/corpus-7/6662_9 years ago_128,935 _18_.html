I would like to move a file or folder from one place to another within the same repository without having to use Repo Browser to do it, and without creating two independent add/delete operations.  Using Repo Browser works fine except that your code will be hanging in a broken state until you get any supporting changes checked in afterwards (like the .csproj file for example).Update: People have suggested "move" from the command line. Is there a TortoiseSVN equivalent?To move a file or set of files using Tortoise SVN, right-click-and-drag the target files to their destination and release the right mouse button. The popup menu will have a SVN move versioned files here option.Note that the destination folder must have already been added to the repository for the SVN move versioned files here option to appear.svn move \xe2\x80\x94 Move a file or directory.http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re18.htmlIn Windows Explorer, with the right-mouse button, click and drag the file from where it is to where you want it. Upon releasing the right-mouse button, you will see a context menu with options such as "SVN Move versioned file here".http://tortoisesvn.net/most-forgotten-featureUnder TortoiseSVN, see the following page: http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-copy.htmlIf you want to move files around and keep the csproj files up to date, the easiest way is to use a Visual Studio plugin like AnkhSVN. \nThat will automatically commit both the move action (as an delete + add with history, because that\'s how Subversion works) and a change in the .csprojFrom the command line, you can type svn mv path1 path2. This will create an add and a delete operation, but there\'s not really a way around that - as far as I know - in Subversion.Subversion does not yet have a first-class rename operations.There\'s a 6-year-old bug on the problem: http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=898It\'s being considered for 1.6, now that merge tracking (a higher priority) has been added (in 1.5).Use Tortoise\'s RENAME command, and type in a relative path ("folder/file.ext").As mentioned earlier, you\'ll create the add and delete commands.  You can use svn move on both your working copy or the repository url.  If you use your working copy, the changes won\'t be committed - you\'ll need to commit in a separate operation.  If you svn move a URL, you\'ll need to supply a --message, and the changes will be reflected in the repository immediately.Use the svn move command to move file/folder.
