This question already has an answer here:What\'s the difference between unit tests and integration tests?  Are there different names for these tests? Like some people calling unit tests functional tests, etc?A unit test is a test written by the programmer to verify that a relatively small piece of code is doing what it is intended to do. They are narrow in scope, they should be easy to write and execute, and their effectiveness depends on what the programmer considers to be useful. The tests are intended for the use of the programmer, they are not directly useful to anybody else, though, if they do their job, testers and users downstream should benefit from seeing fewer bugs. Part of being a unit test is the implication that things outside the code under test are mocked or stubbed out. Unit tests shouldn\'t have dependencies on outside systems. They test internal consistency as opposed to proving that they play nicely with some outside system. An integration test is done to demonstrate that different pieces of the system work together. Integration tests cover whole applications, and they require much more effort to put together. They usually require resources like database instances and hardware to be allocated for them. The integration tests do a more convincing job of demonstrating the system works (especially to non-programmers) than a set of unit tests can, at least to the extent the integration test environment resembles production.Actually "integration test" gets used for a wide variety of things, from full-on system tests against an environment made to resemble production to any test that uses a resource (like a database or queue) that isn\'t mocked out.A unit test should have no dependencies on code outside the unit tested. You decide what the unit is by looking for the smallest testable part. Where there are dependencies they should be replaced by false objects. Mocks, stubs .. The  tests execution thread starts and ends within the smallest testable unit.When false objects are replaced by real objects and tests execution thread crosses into other testable units. you have an integration testA unit test is done in (as far as possible) total isolation.An integration test is done when the tested object or module is working like it should be, with other bits of code.A unit test tests code that you have complete control over whereas an integration test tests how your code uses or "integrates" with some other code.So you would write unit tests to make sure your own libraries work as intended, and then write integration tests to make sure your code plays nicely with other code you are making use of, for instance a library.Functional tests are related to integration tests, but refer more specifically to tests that test an entire system or application with all of the code running together, almost a super integration test.Unit test is usually done for a single functionality implemented in Software module. The scope of testing is entirely within this SW module. Unit test never fulfils the final functional requirements. It comes under whitebox testing methodology..Whereas Integration test is done to ensure the different SW module implementations. Testing is usually carried out after module level integration is done in SW development.. This test will cover the functional requirements but not enough to ensure system validation.
