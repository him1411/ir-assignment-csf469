I have a very similar requirement specified here.I need to have the user\'s browser start a download manually when $(\'a#someID\').click();But I cannot use the window.href method, since it replaces the current page contents with the file you\'re trying to download. Instead I want to open the download in new window/tab. How is this possible?Use an invisible <iframe>:To force the browser to download a file it would otherwise be capable of rendering (such as HTML or text files), you need the server to set the file\'s MIME Type to a nonsensical value, such as application/x-please-download-me or alternatively application/octet-stream, which is used for arbitrary binary data.If you only want to open it in a new tab, the only way to do this is for the user to a click on a link with its target attribute set to _blank.In jQuery:Whenever that link is clicked, it will download the file in a new tab/window.I have created the jQuery File Download plugin (Demo) (GitHub) which could also help with your situation.
