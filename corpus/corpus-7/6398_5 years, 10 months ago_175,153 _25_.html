The different LogCat methods are:What are the appropriate situations to use each type of Logging? I know that perhaps it\'s just a little bit of semantics and perhaps it doesn\'t really matter, but for LogCat filtering in Android Studio and Eclipse, it would be nice to know I am using the proper methods at the appropriate times.Let\'s go in reverse order:Log.e: This is for when bad stuff happens. Use this tag in places like inside a catch statment. You know that an error has occurred and therefore you\'re logging an error.Log.w: Use this when you suspect something shady is going on. You may not be completely in full on error mode, but maybe you recovered from some unexpected behavior. Basically, use this to log stuff you didn\'t expect to happen but isn\'t necessarily an error. Kind of like a "hey, this happened, and it\'s weird, we should look into it."Log.i: Use this to post useful information to the log. For example: that you have successfully connected to a server. Basically use it to report successes.Log.d: Use this for debugging purposes. If you want to print out a bunch of messages so you can log the exact flow of your program, use this. If you want to keep a log of variable values, use this.Log.v: Use this when you want to go absolutely nuts with your logging. If for some reason you\'ve decided to log every little thing in a particular part of your app, use the Log.v tag.And as a bonus...The different methods are indications of priority.  As you\'ve listed them, they\'re going from least to most important.  I think how you specifically map them to debug logs in your code depends on the component or app you\'re working on, as well as how Android treats them on different build flavors (eng, userdebug, and user).  I have done a fair amount of work in the native daemons in Android, and this is how I do it.  It may not apply directly to your app, but there may be some common ground.  If my explanation sounds vague, it\'s because some of this is more of an art than a science.  My basic rule is to be as efficient as possible, ensure you can reasonably debug your component without killing the performance of the system, and always check for errors and log them.V - Printouts of state at different intervals, or upon any events occurring which my component processes.  Also possibly very detailed printouts of the payloads of messges/events that my component receives or sends.D - Details of minor events that occur within my component, as well as payloads of of messages/events that my component receives or sends.I - The header of any messages/events that my component receives or sends, as well as any important pieces of the payload which are critical to my component\'s operation.W - Anything that happens that is unusual or suspicious, but not necessarily an error.E - Errors, meaning things that aren\'t supposed to happen when things are working as they should.The biggest mistake I see people make is that they overuse things like V, D, and I, but never use W or E.  If an error is, by definition, not supposed to happen, or should only happen very rarely, then it\'s extremely cheap for you to log a message when it occurs.  On the other hand, if every time somebody presses a key you do a Log.i(), you\'re abusing the shared logging resource.  Of course, use common sense and be careful with error logs for things outside of your control (like network errors), or those contained in tight loops.Maybe BadGoodWith all this in mind, the closer your code gets to "production ready", the more you can restrict the base logging level for your code (you need V in alpha, D in beta, I in production, or possibly even W in production).  You should run through some simple use cases and view the logs to ensure that you can still mostly understand what\'s happening as you apply more restrictive filtering.  If you run with the filter below, you should still be able to tell what your app is doing, but maybe not get all the details.The source code provides some basic guidance:The order in terms of verbosity, from least to most is ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, VERBOSE.  Verbose should never be compiled into an application except during development.  Debug logs are compiled in but stripped at runtime.  Error, warning and info logs are always kept.For more detail, Kurtis\' answer is dead on.  I would just add: Don\'t log any private/personally identifiable information at INFO or above (WARN/ERROR).  Otherwise bug reports or anything else that includes logging may be polluted.I think the point of those different types of logging is if you want your app to basically self filter its own logs. So Verbose could be to log absolutely everything of importance in your app, then the debug level would log a subset of the verbose logs, and then Info level will log a subset of the debug logs. When you get down to the Error logs, then you just want to log any sort of errors that may have occured. There is also a debug level called Fatal for when something really hits the fan in your app.In general, you\'re right, it\'s basically arbitrary, and it\'s up to you to define what is considered a debug log versus informational, versus and error, etc. etc.The Android Studio website has recently (I think) provided some advice what kind of messages to expect from different log levels that may be useful along with Kurtis\' answer:
