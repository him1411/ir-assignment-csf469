I\'ve been experimenting with the new android build system and I\'ve run into a small issue.  I\'ve compiled my own aar package of ActionBarSherlock which I\'ve called \'actionbarsherlock.aar\'.  What I\'m trying to do is actually use this aar to build my final APK.  If I include the whole ActionBarSherlock library as an android-library module to my main project using compile project (\':actionbarsherlock\') I\'m able to build successfully without any problems.But my problem is that I want to provide that dependency as a aar file package MANUALLY just if I would a JAR then I can\'t seem to figure out how to properly include it into my project.  I\'ve attempted to use the compile configuration but this doesn\'t seem to work.  I keep on getting cannot find symbol during compile which tells me that the classes.jar from aar package isn\'t getting included in the classpath.Does anyone know of the syntax to manually include an aar package as a file?build.gradle EDIT: So the answer is that it\'s not currently supported, here\'s the issue if you want to track it.EDIT: Currently as this is still not supported directly the best alternative seems to be the proposed solution from @RanWakshlakEDIT: Also simpler by using the syntax proposed by @VipulShah Please follow below steps to get it working ( I have tested it up to Android Studio 2.2)Lets say you have kept aar file in libs folder. ( assume file name is cards.aar )then in app build.gradle specify following and click sync project with Gradle files.\nOpen Project level build.gradle and add flatDir{dirs \'libs\'} like did belowand now open app level build.grdle file and add .aar file  If everything goes well you will see library entry is made in build -> exploded-aarAlso note that if you are importing a .aar file from another project that has dependencies you\'ll need to include these in your build.gradle, too.You can reference an aar file from a repository.\nMaven is an option, but there is a simpler solution: put the aar file in your libs directory and add a directory repository.Then reference the library in the dependency section:You can check out  Min\'an blog post for more info.The below approach works with latest Android studio (> v0.8.x):Save the aar file under app module\'s libs folder (eg: <project>/<app>/libs/myaar.aar) Add the below to build.gradle of your "app" module folder (not your project root build.gradle). Note the name in compile line, it is myaar@aar not myaar.aar.Click Tools -> Android -> Sync Project with Gradle FilesCurrently referencing a local .aar file is not supported (as confirmed by Xavier Ducrochet)What you can do instead is set up a local Maven repository (much more simple than it sounds) and reference the .aar from there.I\'ve written a blogpost detailing how to get it working here:http://www.flexlabs.org/2013/06/using-local-aar-android-library-packages-in-gradle-buildsI\'ve just succeed!copy mylib-0.1.aar file under libs/ folderadd these lines to bottom of build.gradle [should be app, not project]So far so good. Here comes the most important point: Gradle needs to access network for dependencies unless offline mode enabled. So you have to be sure that you have enabled Offline work checkbox in Project Structures/Gradle -- OR -- configured proxy settings in order to access network.In order to configure proxy settings you have to modify gradle.properties file of project http and https separately as below:Hope this works..Unfortunately none of the solutions here worked for me (I get unresolved dependencies). What finally worked and is the easiest way IMHO is: Highlight the project name from Android Studio then File -> New Module -> Import JAR or AAR Package. Credit goes to the solution in this postYou can add multiple aar dependencies with just few lines of code.Add local flatDir repository:Add every aar in libs directory to compile dependency configuration:I\'ve also had this problem. This issue report: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=55863 seems to suggest that directly referencing the .AAR file is not supported.Perhaps the alternative for now is to define the actionbarsherlock library as a Gradle library under the parent directory of your project and reference accordingly.The syntax is defined here http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide#TOC-Referencing-a-LibraryIn my case I have some depencies in my library and when I create an aar from it I failed, because of missed depencies, so my solution is to add all depencies from my lib with an arr file. So my project level build.gradle looks so:build.gradle(modile app) so:and library build.gradle:I found this workaround in the Android issue tracker:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=55863#c21The trick (not a fix) is to isolating your .aar files into a subproject and adding your libs as artifacts:More info:\nHandling-transitive-dependencies-for-local-artifacts-jars-and-aarI tried all solution here but none is working, then I realise I made a mistake, I put the .aar in wrong folder, as you can see below, I thought I should put in root folder, so I created a libs folder there (1 in picture), but inside the app folder, there is already a libs, you should put in second libs, hope this help those who has same issue as mine:
