After upgrading to Ubuntu 13.10, when I click on any menus in Eclipse (Help, Window, Run) they don\xe2\x80\x99t show up. Only menu stubs and selection are visible.I tried installing fresh 4.3 and the same thing is happening. Is anyone else experiencing this behavior?The same question has been answered on askubuntu:Eclipse menus are cut off or don\'t showI might have found a possible solution for your problem. I have experienced the same issue as you have described, Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit Unity, Eclipse 4.3.0, menus were not visible.So I realise that it might be helpful if I clarify myself, the desktop shortcut file for Eclipse would contain something like this:The row Exec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 /home/USERNAME/Dokument/eclipse/eclipse, part referenced in the post I pointed to, is the one that makes menus visible, et voila! :)In my case this file (eclipse.desktop) resides in /usr/share/applications/Hope this helps.You have to create a new file to open eclipse.This bug has been confirmed in Ubuntu 13.10, here is a link. \nIn order to overcome problem, you have to change your eclipse.desktop file in part of Exec passing env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY with eclipse path and eclipse will be runnable from launcher with functional menu bar.\nHere is patern for changing eclipse.desktop file:You should type export UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 before opening eclipse, and you have to open eclipse from the terminal instead of the global menu.I had the same disabled sub-menus problem with Eclipse Kepler 64-bit on Ubuntu 13.10. But I finally managed to get it run with the following little work around. This bug has actually been already reported in this link.Create a eclipse.desktop file in /usr/share/applications/with the following contents.or else, you could also try with the following executable bash script file which opens Eclipse. Place the file in /bin directory or /usr/local/bin.1) First, close eclipse and do this:2) at the end of this file just copy-paste this line Open eclipse, the eclipse\'s menu will start showing up.\n(Works on On post Ubuntu version 12.04)Nothing worked for me until I added the following line to the .profile file in my home folder and restarted my computer. It worked for me.For those who use the ADT (Android Developer Tools) bundle:This will bring the menus back, however not integrated into the top bar.RobertAs for me, I found it better to edit eclipse starter itself,\nmine is /usr/bin/eclipse (root permission required).Last line:becomes:So, now it doesn\'t matter how it starts - by desctop icon, terminal command or self-restart after new plugin installation.I solved it just opening my Eclipse by terminal as SU.The same question has been posted (and answered by me) on askubuntu:Eclipse menus are cut off or don\'t showHere is the complete answer.This method takes for granted that you already have your eclipse.desktop file (or that you can alternatively create a new one from scratch). Otherwise, you can momentarily take a look at the "fast way" below.Open your eclipse.desktop file:(If you can\'t find it in this path, try in ~/.local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop. Otherwise, you could have to find yours using locate command).Replace the Exec= line with this:Where "eclipse" is the path to your eclipse executable. In this case it\'s just "eclipse" since there\'s a symlink in /usr/bin folder.NOTE: If you can\'t find your eclipse.desktop file, you can simply create one from scratch in the above path, and fill it with these lines:Save the file.Now you can run Eclipse from its icon as usual.If you haven\'t got any eclipse.desktop file and you don\'t want to create it at the moment, you can simply run Eclipse with this command:where "eclipse" is the path to your eclipse executable. Note that this is just the fast way to run Eclipse once. If you don\'t want to remember this command and use it every time you have to run Eclipse, follow the "stable way" above.Sources:You can still access the menu using the ALT key :)What if I do not have such a file:/usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktopI guess you have that file, if you install eclipse from ubuntu repository. If you install a standalone eclipse, then that file does not matter. And there is no such file over there.close your eclipse if you have already launched eclipse application.type this command on terminalNote : you may found eclipse.desktop file in this path..../usr/share/applications/EclipseAdd these lines in this file.Looks like the bug is still there, even in 14.10 with Eclipse Luna. My menus wont show. I setup eclipse using the tutorial here - \nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/06/install-latest-eclipse-ubuntu-14-04/and used that tutorial plus the top answer to make the desktop like this - Now, my eclipse won\'t even run. With the desktop icon below, at least eclipse opens up - EDIT - Menus are now visible. I dunno what happened!
