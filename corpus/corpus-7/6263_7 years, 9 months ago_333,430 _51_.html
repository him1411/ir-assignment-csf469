To identify each devices uniquely I would like to use the IMEI (or ESN number for CDMA devices). How to access this programmatically?You want to call android.telephony.TelephonyManager.getDeviceId().This will return whatever string uniquely identifies the device (IMEI on GSM, MEID for CDMA).You\'ll need the following permission in your AndroidManifest.xml:<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" /> in order to do this.That being said, be careful about doing this. Not only will users wonder why your application is accessing their telephony stack, it might be difficult to migrate data over if the user gets a new device.Update: As mentioned in the comments below, this is not a secure way to authenticate users, and raises privacy concerns. It is not recommended. Instead, look at the Google+ Login API if you want to implement a frictionless login system.The Android Backup API is also available if you just want a lightweight way to persist a bundle of strings for when a user resets their phone (or buys a new device).In addition to the answer of Trevor Johns, you can use this as follows:And you should add the following permission into your Manifest.xml file:In emulator, you\'ll probably get a like a "00000..." value. getDeviceId() returns NULL if device ID is not available.I use the following code to get the IMEI or use Secure.ANDROID_ID as an alternative, when the device doesn\'t have phone capabilities:Or you can use the ANDROID_ID setting from Android.Provider.Settings.System (as described here strazerre.com).This has the advantage that it doesn\'t require special permissions but can change if another application has write access and changes it (which is apparently unusual but not impossible).Just for reference here is the code from the blog:Implementation note: if the ID is critical to the system architecture you need to be aware that in practice some of the very low end Android phones & tablets have been found reusing the same ANDROID_ID (9774d56d682e549c was the value showing up in our logs)From: http://mytechead.wordpress.com/2011/08/28/how-to-get-imei-number-of-android-device/:The following code helps in obtaining IMEI number of android devices :Permissions required in Android Manifest: NOTE: In case of tablets or devices which can\xe2\x80\x99t act as Mobile Phone\nIMEI will be null.to get IMEI (international mobile equipment identifier)to get device unique idUpdate:For uniquely Identification of devices, You can Use Secure.ANDROID_ID.Old Answer:Disadvantages of using IMEI as Unique Device ID:You can Use The WLAN MAC Address string (Not Recommended For Marshmallow and Marshmallow+ as WLAN MAC Address has been deprecated on Marshmallow forward. So you\'ll get a bogus value)We can get the Unique ID for android phones using the WLAN MAC address also. The MAC address is unique for all devices and it works for all kinds of devices.Advantages of using WLAN MAC address as Device ID:It is unique identifier for all type of devices (smart phones and\n   tablets).It remains unique if the application is reinstalledDisadvantages of using WLAN MAC address as Device ID:Give You a Bogus Value from Marshmallow and above.If device doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have wifi hardware then you get null MAC address,\n   but generally it is seen that most of the Android devices have wifi\n   hardware and there are hardly few devices in the market with no wifi\n   hardware.SOURCE : technetexperts.comThe method getDeviceId() of TelephonyManager returns the unique device ID, for example, the IMEI for GSM and the MEID or ESN for CDMA phones. Return null if device ID is not available.Java Code XMLPermission Required\nREAD_PHONE_STATE in manifest file.For Android 6.0+ the game has changed so i suggest you use this;The best way to go is during runtime else you get permission errors. Hope this helps you or someone.As in API 26 getDeviceId() is depreciated so you can use following code to cater API 26 and earlier versionsDon\'t forget to add permission request for "READ_PHONE_STATE" to use above code.use below code gives you Imi numberfor API Level 11 or above\ncase TelephonyManager.PHONE_TYPE_SIP:\n   return "SIP";TelephonyManager telephonyManager = (TelephonyManager)getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);\n  textDeviceID.setText(getDeviceID(telephonyManager));You can use this TelephonyManager TELEPHONY_SERVICE function to get unique device ID,\nRequires Permission: READ_PHONE_STATE Example, the IMEI for GSM and the MEID or ESN for CDMA phones. Return null if device ID is not available.
