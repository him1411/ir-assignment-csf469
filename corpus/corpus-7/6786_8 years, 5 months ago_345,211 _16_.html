I want to plot a graph with one logarithmic axis using matplotlib. I\'ve been reading the docs, but can\'t figure out the syntax. I know that it\'s probably something simple like \'scale=linear\' in the plot arguments, but I can\'t seem to get it rightSample program: You can use the Axes.set_yscale method. That allows you to change the scale after the Axes object is created. That would also allow you to build a control to let the user pick the scale if you needed to.The relevant line to add is:You can use \'linear\' to switch back to a linear scale. Here\'s what your code would look like:First of all, it\'s not very tidy to mix pylab and pyplot code. What\'s more, pyplot style is preferred over using pylab.Here is a slightly cleaned up code, using only pyplot functions:The relevant function is pyplot.yscale(). If you use the object-oriented version, replace it by the method Axes.set_yscale(). Remember that you can also change the scale of X axis, using pyplot.xscale() (or Axes.set_xscale()).Check my question What is the difference between \xe2\x80\x98log\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98symlog\xe2\x80\x99? to see a few examples of the graph scales that matplotlib offers.You simply need to use semilogy instead of plot:I know this is slightly off-topic, since some comments mentioned the ax.set_yscale(\'log\') to be "nicest" solution I thought a rebuttal could be due. I would not recommend using ax.set_yscale(\'log\') for histograms and bar plots. In my version (0.99.1.1) i run into some rendering problems - not sure how general this issue is. However both bar and hist has optional arguments to set the y-scale to log, which work fine.references:\nhttp://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.barhttp://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.histSo if you are simply using the unsophisticated API, like I often am (I use it in ipython a lot), then this is simplyHope this helps someone looking for a simple answer! :).
