I\'m trying to define my own exception class the easiest way, and this is what I\'m getting:This is what Java compiler says:I had a feeling that this constructor has to be inherited from java.lang.Exception, isn\'t it?No, you don\'t "inherit" non-default constructors, you need to define the one taking a String in your class. Typically you use super(message) in your constructor to invoke your parent constructor. For example, like this:A typical custom exception I\'d define is something like this:I even create a template using Eclipse so I don\'t have to write all the stuff over and over again.If you use the new class dialog in Eclipse you can just set the Superclass field to java.lang.Exception and check "Constructors from superclass" and it will generate the following:In response to the question below about not calling super() in the defualt constructor, Oracle has this to say:Note: If a constructor does not explicitly invoke a superclass constructor, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the superclass.Reason for this is explained in the Inheritance article of the Java Platform which says: "A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested\n  classes) from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they\n  are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass\n  can be invoked from the subclass."Exception class has two constructors If you inherit from Exception, you have to provide a constructor that takes a String as a parameter (it will contain the error message).
