How can I clone git repository with specific revision, something like I usually do in Mercurial:UPDATE for git versions > 1.7 use git clone and git reset, as described in Vaibhav Bajpai\'s answerIf you don\'t want to fetch the full repository then you probably shouldn\'t be using clone. You can always just use fetch to choose the branch that you want to fetch. I\'m not an hg expert so I don\'t know the details of -r but in git you can do something like this.To again go back to the most recent commitCloning a git repository, aptly, clones the entire repository: there isn\'t a way to select only one revision to clone. However, once you perform git clone, you can checkout a specific revision by doing checkout <rev>.If you mean you want to fetch everything from the beginning up to a particular point, Charles Bailey\'s answer is perfect.  If you want to do the reverse and retrieve a subset of the history going back from the current date, you can use git clone --depth [N]  where N is the number of revs of history you want.  However:--depth Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of revisions. A shallow repository has a number of limitations (you cannot clone or fetch from it, nor push from nor into it), but is adequate if you are only interested in the recent history of a large project with a long history, and would want to send in fixes as patches.Just to sum things up (git v. 1.7.2.1):TL;DR - Just create a tag in the source repository against the commit you want to clone up to and use the tag in the fetch command. You can delete the tag from the original repo later to clean up.Well, its 2014 and it looks like Charles Bailey\'s accepted answer from 2010 is well and truly outdated by now and most (all?) of the other answers involve cloning, which many people are hoping to avoid.The following solution achieves what the OP and many others are looking for, which is a way to create a copy of a repository, including history, but only up to a certain commit.Here are the commands I used with git version 2.1.2 to clone a local repo (ie. a repository in another directory) up to a certain point:Hopefully this solution keeps working for a few more years! :-)Using 2 of the above answers (How to clone git repository with specific revision/changeset? and How to clone git repository with specific revision/changeset?)\nHelped me to come up with a definative.  If you want to clone up to a point, then that point has to be a tag/branch not simply an SHA or the FETCH_HEAD gets confused.  Following the git fetch set, if you use a branch or tag name, you get a response, if you simply use an SHA-1 you get not response.\nHere\'s what I did:-\ncreate a full working clone of the full repo, from the actual originThen create a local branch, at the point that\'s interestingThen create my new blank repo, with my local copy as its originAt that point I got this response. I note it because if you use a SHA-1 in place of the branch above, nothing happens, so the response, means it workedNow in my case, I then needed to put that back onto gitlab, as a fresh repo so I didWhich meant I could rebuild my repo from the origin_point by using git --git-dir=../ui/.git format-patch -k -1 --stdout <sha1> | git am -3 -k to cherry pick remotely then use git push origin to upload the whole lot back to its new home.  Hope that helps someoneMy version was a combination of accepted and most upvoted answers. But it\'s a little bit different, because everyone uses SHA1 but nobody tells you how to get itnow you can see all branches & commitsFinally you know SHA1 of desired commitYou Can use simply git check <commit hash>in this sequence git clone URLTORepositorygit checkout  commithash  commit hash looks like this "45ef55ac20ce2389c9180658fdba35f4a663d204"git uses the word origin in stead of popularly known revisionFollowing is a snippet from the manual $ git help clone
