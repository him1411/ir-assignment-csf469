What does the ... do in this React (using JSX) code and what is it called?Those are JSX spread attributes:Spread AttributesIf you already have props as an object, and you want to pass it in JSX, you can use ... as a "spread" operator to pass the whole props object. These two components are equivalent:Spread attributes can be useful when you are building generic containers. However, they can also make your code messy by making it easy to pass a lot of irrelevant props to components that don\'t care about them. We recommend that you use this syntax sparingly.That documentation used to mention that although this is (for now) a JSX thing, there\'s a proposal to add Object Rest and Spread Properties to JavaScript itself. (JavaScript has had rest and spread for arrays since ES2015, but not for object properties.) As of April 2017, that proposal is at StageÂ 3, and so it hasn\'t made it into the soon-to-be-released ES2017 specification. It won\'t be clear for a few months whethr it\'ll advance quickly enough to make ES2018; one hopes so. (More about stages here.) Transpilers have supported it for some time (even separately from JSX).Side note: Although the JSX quote above talks about a "spread operator," ... isn\'t an operator, and can\'t be. Operators have a single result value. ... is primary syntax (kind of like the () used with for aren\'t the grouping operator, even though they look like it).As you know  ... are called Spread Attributes which the name represents it allows an expression to be expanded.And in this case(I\'m gonna simplify it). This:is equal toSo in short, it\'s a neat short-cut, we can say.The three dots in JavaScript are spread / rest operator. Spread operatorThe spread syntax allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments are expected.Rest parametersThe rest parameter syntax is used for functions with variable number of arguments. The spread / rest operator for arrays was introduced in ES6. There\'s a State 2 proposal for object spread / rest properties.TypeScript also supports the spread syntax and can transpile that into older versions of ECMAScript with minor issues.  This is a feature of es6 which is used in React as well. Look at the below example:This way is fine if we have maximum 3 parameters but what if we need to add for example 110 parameters. Should we define them all and add them one by one?!\nOf course there is an easier way to do which is called SPREAD.\nInstead of passing all those parameters you write :We have no idea how many parameters we have but we know there are heaps of those.\nBased on es6 we can rewrite the above function as below and use the spread and mapping between them to make it as easy as a piece of cake:For those who come from the Python world, JSX Spread Attributes are equivalent to\nUnpacking Argument Lists (the Python **-operator).I\'m aware this is a JSX question, but working with analogies sometimes helps to get it faster.The three dots (...) are called the spread operator, and this is conceptually similar to the ES6 array spread operator, JSX\ntaking advantage of these supported and developing standards in order to provide a cleaner syntax in JSXSpread properties in object initializers copies own enumerable\n  properties from a provided object onto the newly created object.Reference: 1) https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread#spread-properties2) https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-spread.htmlIt\'s just defining props in a different way in JSX! It\'s using ... array and object operator in ES6 (object one not fully supported yet), so basically if you already define your props, you can pass it to your element this way. So in your case, the code should be something like this:so the props you defined, now separated and can be reused if necessary.It\'s equal to:These are the quotes from React team about spread operator in JSX:JSX Spread Attributes\n  If you know all the properties that you want to place on a component\n  ahead of time, it is easy to use JSX:Mutating Props is Bad If you don\'t know which properties you want to set, you might be tempted to add them onto the object later:This is an anti-pattern because it means that we can\'t help you check\n  the right propTypes until way later. This means that your propTypes\n  errors end up with a cryptic stack trace.The props should be considered immutable. Mutating the props object\n  somewhere else could cause unexpected consequences so ideally it would\n  be a frozen object at this point.Spread Attributes Now you can use a new feature of JSX called spread attributes:The properties of the object that you pass in are copied onto the\n  component\'s props.You can use this multiple times or combine it with other attributes.\n  The specification order is important. Later attributes override\n  previous ones.What\'s with the weird ... notation? The ... operator (or spread operator) is already supported for arrays in ES6. There is also\n  an ECMAScript proposal for Object Rest and Spread Properties. We\'re\n  taking advantage of these supported and developing standards in order\n  to provide a cleaner syntax in JSX.This is a new feature in ES6/Harmony. It is called the Spread Operator.\nIt lets you either separate the constituent parts of an array/object, or take multiple items/parameters and glue them together.\nHere is an example:And with an object/keys:What\'s really cool is you can use it to mean "the rest of the values".Those are called spreads. Just as the name implies. It means it\'s putting whatever the value of it in those array or objects. Such as :
