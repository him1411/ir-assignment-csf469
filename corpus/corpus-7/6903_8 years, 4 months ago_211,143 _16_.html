In a similar way to using varargs in C or C++:Yes.This is simple and works if you disregard keyword arguments:As you can see, Python will give you a single tuple with all the arguments.For keyword arguments you need to accept those as a separate actual argument, as shown in Skurmedel\'s answer.Adding to unwinds post:You can send multiple key-value args too.And you can mix the two:They must be both declared and called in that order, that is the function signature needs to be *args, **kwargs, and called in that order.Adding to the other excellent posts.Sometimes you don\'t want to specify the number of arguments and want to use keys for them (the compiler will complain if one argument passed in a dictionary is not used in the method).Then you can do things likeIf I may, Skurmedel\'s code is for python 2; to adapt it to python 3, change iteritems to items and add parenthesis to print. That could prevent beginners like me to bump into:\nAttributeError: \'dict\' object has no attribute \'iteritems\' and search elsewhere (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/30418498/6358973) why this is happening.and:the above code will outputThis is as good as passing variable arguments by means of a dictionary
