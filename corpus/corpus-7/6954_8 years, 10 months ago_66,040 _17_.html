I am new to VIM. I use the :e and :w commands to edit and to write a file which are very convenient. I am not sure if there is "close" command to close the current file without leaving VIM?I know that the :q command can be used to close a file, but if it is the last file, VIM is closed as well; Actually on Mac OS MacVIM does quit. Only the VIM window is closed and I could use Control-N to open a blank VIM again. I would like VIM to remain open with a blank screen.This deletes the buffer (which translates to close the file)As already mentioned, you\'re looking for :bd, however this doesn\'t completely remove the buffer, it\'s still accessible:You may instead want :bw which completely removes it.Not knowing about :bw bugged me for quite a while.If you have multiple split windows in your vim window then :bd closes the split window of the current file... so I like to use something a little more advanced:If you\'ve saved the last file already, then :enew is your friend (:enew! if you don\'t want to save the last file). Note that the original file will still be in your buffer list (the one accessible via :ls).If you modify a file and want to close it without quitting VIM and without saving, you should type :bd!:bd can be mapped. I map it to F4, shift-F4 if I need to force-close because of some change I no longer want.There is a plugin for that: bufkill (see http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1147)This adds BD etc to delete the buffer without closing any splits (as bd) would alone.Look at the Butane plugin to keep the window layout when closing a buffer.https://github.com/Soares/butane.vimI have mapped bd to F4 with \ninsert the following in your .vimrc file and with pressing F4, it will close the current file.I have the same issue so I made the plugin.\nThis plugin replace :q and other commands and then prevent the window closed.if you still have issue, please try to use following plugin. \nhttps://github.com/taka-vagyok/prevent-win-closed.vim
