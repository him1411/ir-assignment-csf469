What is the version of SQLite used in Android?Reason: I\'m wondering how to handle schema migrations. The newer SQLite versions support an "ALTER TABLE" SQL command which would save me having to copy data, drop the table, recreate table and re-insert data.UPDATE OCT 2016: Here is a link to the updated official docs which includes the main points in this answer: android.database.sqlite package-level javadocUsing the emulators (adb shell sqlite3 --version):UPDATE: Sorry, older (SDK 18 and earlier) package-level API diffs have stopped working: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37048579SQLite 3.18.2:SQLite 3.9.2:SQLite 3.8.10.2:SQLite 3.8.6.1 (SQLite link is for 3.8.6 because 3.8.6.1 does not exist for some reason):SQLite 3.8.6:SQLite (unknown):SQLite 3.7.11:SQLite 3.7.4:SQLite 3.6.22:SQLite 3.5.9:Note: Android SDK level links show where the android.database.sqlite package has changed. Where there is no link (e.g. SDK level 17), indicates no changes to that package.Note: Here are some anomalies (list by no means exhaustive):SQLite 3.7.13 (instead of 3.7.11):SQLite 3.7.6.3 (instead of 3.6.22):SQLite 3.7.5 (instead of 3.7.4):SQLite 3.7.0.1 (instead of 3.6.22):SQLite 3.6.23.1 (instead of 3.5.9):Note: adb command to get SQLite version only works on emulators and on devices with sqlite3 available: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3645800/444761For other devices, see Juri\'s answer.I have added an Issue #58909 to the Android Issue Tracker. Please star this if you would like to support it.Note: if you want your app to use the same version of SQLite across all Android versions, consider using this 3rd party SQLite support library.Although the documentation gives 3.4.0 as reference number, if you execute the following sql, you\'ll notice that there is a much higher number of SQlite installed:This is just a piece of quick, dirty code to retrieve the sqlite version. For instance on a HTC Hero with Android 2.1, I get: 3.5.9.On my Nexus One with Android 2.2, I even get 3.6.22.Same on ADP1 1.6 & 2.1 emulator.A short overview of the Andorid APIs and the supported SQLite versions.The overview is from the link in Mark Carters answer.
