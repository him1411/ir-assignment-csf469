I need to use "HTTP Post" with WebClient to post some data to a specific URL I have.Now, I know this can be accomplished with WebRequest but for some reasons I wanna use WebClient instead. Is that possible? If so, can someone show me some example or point me to the right direction?I just found the solution and yea it was easier than I thought :)so here is the solution:      it works like charm :)There is a built in method called UploadValues that can send HTTP POST (or any kind of HTTP methods) AND handles the construction of request body (concatenating parameters with "&" and escaping characters by url encoding) in proper form data format:Using WebClient.UploadString or WebClient.UploadData you can POST data to the server easily.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll show an example using UploadData, since UploadString is used in the same manner as DownloadString.more : http://www.daveamenta.com/2008-05/c-webclient-usage/can be simplified ashttp://www.myurl.com/post.php?param1=value1&param2=value2&param3=value3.This always works. I found the original one works on and off.
