How to convert a PNG image to a SVG?There is a website where you can upload your image, and see the result.http://vectormagic.com/homeBut if you want to download your svg-image, you need to register.\n(If you register, you get 2 images for free)potrace does not support PNG as input file, but PNM.\nTherefore, first convert from PNG to PNM: Input file = 2017.png Temporary file = 2017.pnmOutput file = 2017.svg  ykarikos proposes a script png2svg.sh that I have improved:If you want to convert many files, you can also use the following one-line command:See also this good comparison of raster to vector converters on Wikipedia.A png is a bitmap image style and an SVG is a vector-based graphics design which supports bitmaps so it\'s not as if it would convert the image to vectors, just an image embedded in a vector-based format.  You could do this using http://www.inkscape.org/ which is free.  It would embed it, however it also has a Live Trace like engine which will try to convert it to paths if you wish (using potrace). See live trace in adobe illustrator (commericial) is an example:http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/illustrator/ss/sflivetrace.htmYou may want to look at potrace.with adobe illustrator:Open Adobe Illustrator. Click "File" and select "Open" to load the .PNG file into the program.Edit the image as needed before saving it as a .SVG file. Click "File" and select "Save As." Create a new file name or use the existing name. Make sure the selected file type is SVG. Choose a directory and click "Save" to save the file.oronline converter\nhttp://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-svgi prefer AI because you can make any changes neededgood luckEasyAs you\'ll see, if you want to do a whole lot of other clever .svg stuff you can do it using Inkscape also.A non-technical observation: I personally prefer this method over "free" website offerings because, aside from often requiring registration, by uploading the image, in all practical terms, one is giving the image to the website owner.To my surprise, potrace it turns out, can only process black and white. That may be fine for you use case, but some may consider lack of color tracing to be problematic.Personally, I\'ve had satisfactory results with\nVector MagicStill it\'s not perfect.I just found this question and answers as I am trying to do the same thing! I did not want to use some of the other tools mentioned. (Don\'t want to give my email away, and don\'t want to pay). I found that Inkscape (v0.91) can do a pretty good job. This tutorial is quick to and easy to understand. Its as simple as selecting your bitmap in Inkskape and Shift+Alt+B.You can also try http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-svgI always use it for my needs.A note to those using potrace and imagemagick, converting PNG images with transparency to PPM doesn\'t seem to work very well. Here is an example that uses the -flatten flag on convert to handle this:Another interesting phenomenon is that you can use PPM (256*3 colors, ie. RGB), PGM (256 colors, ie. grayscale) or PBM (2 colors, ie. white or black only) as the input format. From my limited observations, it would appear that on images which are anti-aliased, PPM and PGM (which produce identical SVGs as far as I can see) shrink the colored area and PBM expands the colored area (albeit only a little). Presumably this is the difference between a pixel > (256 / 2) test and a pixel > 0 test. You can switch between the three by changing the file extension, ie. the following use PBM:Depending on why you want to convert from .png to .svg, you may not have to go through the trouble.  Converting from .png (raster) to .svg (vector) can be a pain if you are not very familiar with the tools available, or if you are not a graphic designer by trade.If someone sends you a large, high resolution file (e.g. 1024x1024), you can resize that down to pretty much any size you want in GIMP.  Often, you will have problems resizing an image if the resolution (number of pixels per inch) is too low.  To rectify this in GIMP, you can:Not as easy as resizing a .svg file, but definitely easier and faster than trying to convert a .png to a .svg, if you already have a big, high-resolution image.I\'m assuming that you wish to write software to do this. To do it naively you would just find lines and set the vectors. To do it intelligently, you attempt to fit shapes onto the drawing (model fitting). Additionally, you should attempt to ascertain bitmaped regions (regions you can\'t model through shames or applying textures. I would not recommend going this route as that it will take quite a bit of time and require a bit of graphics and computer vision knowledge. However, the output will much and scale much better than your original output.http://online-converting.com/image/convert-to-svg/ worked well for converting to svgThis tool is working very well right now.http://www.mobilefish.com/services/image2svg/image2svg.phpIf you\'re on some Linux system, imagemagick is perfect. I.eThis works with heaps of different formats.For other media such as videos and audio use (ffmpeg)\nI know you clearly stated png to svg, however; It\'s still media related.Just a tip for if you wish to go through lots of files; a loop using basic shell tricks..That removes the jpg and adds png which tells convert what you want.
