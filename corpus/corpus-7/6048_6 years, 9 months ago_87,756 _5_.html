I love to use git diff -w to ignore whitespace differences. But, I just noticed that it ignores even whitespace differences in the middle of lines. How could I only ignore whitespace differences that come at the start (^) or end ($) of lines?For end of line use:Instead of what are you using currently:For start of line... you are out of luck if you want a built in solution.However, if you don\'t mind getting your hands dirty there\'s a rather old patch floating out there somewhere that adds support for "--ignore-space-at-sol".
