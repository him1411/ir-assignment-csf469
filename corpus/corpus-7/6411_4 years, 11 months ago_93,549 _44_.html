Python\'s http.server (or SimpleHTTPServer for Python 2) is a great way of serve the contents of the current directory from the command line:However, as far as web servers go, it\'s very slooooow...It behaves as though it\'s single threaded, and occasionally causes timeout errors when loading JavaScript AMD modules using RequireJS. It can take five to ten seconds to load a simple page with no images.What\'s a faster alternative that is just as convenient?http-server for node.js is very convenient, and is a lot faster than Python\'s SimpleHTTPServer. This is primarily because it uses asynchronous IO for concurrent handling of requests, instead of serialising requests.Install node.js if you haven\'t already. Then use the node package manager (npm) to install the package, using the -g option to install globally.  If you\'re on Windows you\'ll need a prompt with administrator permissions, and on Linux/OSX you\'ll want to sudo the command:This will download any required dependencies and install http-server.Now, from any directory, you can type:Path is optional, defaulting to ./public if it exists, otherwise ./.Options are [defaults]:So to serve the current directory on port 8000, type:I recommend: Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com)an event-driven networking engine written in Python and licensed under the open source  MIT license.It\'s cross platform and comes preinstalled on OS X since 10.5. Amongst other things you can start up a simple web server in the current directory with:Explaination of Options (see twistd --help for more):"web" is a Command that runs a simple web server on top of the Twisted async engine. It also accepts command line options (after the "web" command - see twistd web --help for more):There are also a bunch of other commands such as:UbuntuMac OS-X (comes preinstalled since 10.5, or is available in Macports)WindowsTwisted can also utilise security certificates to encrypt the connection. Use this with your existing --path and --port (for plain HTTP) options.go 1.0 includes a http server & util for serving files with a few lines of code.Run this source using go run myserver.go or to build an executable go build myserver.goTry webfs, it\'s tiny and doesn\'t depend on having a platform like node.js or python installed.If you use Mercurial, you can use the built in HTTP server. In the folder you wish to serve up:From the docs:Here\'s another. It\'s a Chrome ExtensionOnce installed you can run it by creating a new tab in Chrome and clicking the apps button near the top leftIt has a simple gui. Click choose folder, then click the http://127.0.0.1:8887 linkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6swHiPtewgive polpetta a try ...npm install -g polpettathen you can polpetta ~/folderand you are ready to go :-)Also consider devd a small webserver written in go. Binaries for many platforms are available here. It\'s small, fast, and provides some interesting optional features like live-reloading when your files change.I found python -m http.server unreliable\xe2\x80\x94some responses would take seconds.Now I use a server called Ran https://github.com/m3ng9i/ranRan: a simple static web server written in GoUsing Servez as a serverNote: I threw this together because Web Server for Chrome is going away since Chrome is removing support for apps.
