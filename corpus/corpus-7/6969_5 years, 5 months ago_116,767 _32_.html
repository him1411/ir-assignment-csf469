Is there a way to set cornerRadius for only top-left and top-right corner of a UIView?EDIT:I tried the following, but it end up not seeing the view anymore. Anything wrong with the code below?Pay attention to the fact that if you have layout constraints attached to it, you must refresh this as follows:If you don\'t do that it won\'t show up.I am not sure why your solution did not work but the following code is working for me. Create a bezier mask and apply it to your view. In my code below I was rounding the bottom corners of the _backgroundView with a radius of 3 pixels. self is a custom UITableViewCell:Swift version with some improvements:Swift 3.0 version:Swift extension hereHere is a Swift version of @JohnnyRockex answerIf you\'re using Auto Layout, you\'ll need to subclass your UIView and call roundCorners in the view\'s layoutSubviews for optimal effect.Swift code example here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35621736/308315Not directly. You will have to:Here is a short method implemented like this:Try this code,Emma: .TopRight and .BottomRight are not working for you perhaps because the call to view.roundCorners is done BEFORE final view bounds are calculated. Note that the Bezier Path derives from the view bounds at the time it is called. For example, if auto layout will narrow the view, the round corners on the right side might be outside the view.\nTry to call it in viewDidLayoutSubviews, where the view\'s bound is final.A way to do this programmatically would be to create a UIView over the top part of the UIView that has the rounded corners. Or you could hide the top underneath something.And finally\xe2\x80\xa6 there is CACornerMask in iOS11!\nWith CACornerMask it can be done pretty easy:All of the answers already given are really good and valid (especially Yunus idea of using the mask property).However I needed something a little more complex because my layer could often change sizes which mean I needed to call that masking logic every time and this was a little bit annoying.I used swift extensions and computed properties to build a real cornerRadii property which takes care of auto updating the mask when layer is layed out.This was achieved using Peter Steinberg great Aspects library for swizzling.Full code is here:I wrote a simple blog post explaining this.The easiest way would be to make a mask with a rounded corner layer.And don\'t forget to: This is how you can set a corner radius for each corner of a button with Xamarin in C#:A lovely extension to reuse Yunus Nedim Mehel solutionSwift 2.3UsageAnd easiest way to do this, you need 2 views
