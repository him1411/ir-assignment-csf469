What is a good complete regular expression or some other process that would take the title:How do you change a title to be part of the URL like Stack Overflow?and turn it into that is used in the SEO-friendly URLs on StackÂ Overflow?The development environment I am using is Ruby on Rails, but if there are some other platform-specific solutions (.NET, PHP, Django), I would love to see those too. I am sure I (or another reader) will come across the same problem on a different platform down the line. I am using custom routes, and I mainly want to know how to alter the string to all special characters are removed, it\'s all lowercase, and all whitespace is replaced.Here\'s how we do it. Note that there are probably more edge conditions than you realize at first glance.This is the second version, unrolled for 5x more performance (and yes, I benchmarked it). I figured I\'d optimize it because this function can be called hundreds of times per page.To see the previous version of the code this replaced (but is functionally equivalent to, and 5x faster), view revision history of this post (click the date link).Also, the RemapInternationalCharToAscii method source code can be found here.Here is my version of Jeff\'s code. I\'ve made the following changes:The case conversion is now also optional.For more details, the unit tests, and an explanation of why Facebook\'s URL scheme is a little smarter than Stack Overflows, I\'ve got an expanded version of this on my blog.You will want to setup a custom route to point the URL to the controller that will handle it. Since you are using Ruby on Rails, here is an introduction in using their routing engine.In Ruby, you will need a regular expression like you already know and here is the regular expression to use:You can also use this JavaScript function for in-form generation of the slug\'s (this one is based on/copied from Django):For good measure, here\'s the PHP function in WordPress that does it... I\'d think that WordPress is one of the more popular platforms that uses fancy links.This function as well as some of the supporting functions can be found in wp-includes/formatting.php.If you are using Rails edge, you can rely on Inflector.parametrize - here\'s the example from the documentation:Also if you need to handle more exotic characters such as accents (\xc3\xa9ph\xc3\xa9m\xc3\xa8re) in previous version of Rails, you can use a mixture of PermalinkFu and DiacriticsFu:I am not familiar with Ruby on Rails, but the following is (untested) PHP code. You can probably translate this very quickly to Ruby on Rails if you find it useful.I hope this helps.I don\'t much about Ruby or Rails, but in Perl, this is what I would do:I just did a quick test and it seems to work.  Hopefully this is relatively easy to translate to Ruby.T-SQL implementation, adapted from dbo.UrlEncode:Assuming that your model class has a title attribute, you can simply override the to_param method within the model, like this:This Railscast episode has all the details. You can also ensure that the title only contains valid characters using this:What about funny characters? What are you going to do about those? Umlauts? Punctuation? These need to be considered. Basically, I would use a white-list approach, as opposed to the black-list approaches above: Describe which characters you will allow, which characters you will convert (to what?) and then change the rest to something meaningfull (""). I doubt you can do this in one regex... Why not just loop through the characters?I know it\'s very old question but since most of the browsers now support unicode urls I found a great solution in XRegex that converts everything except letters (in all languages to \'-\').That can be done in several programming languages.The pattern is \\\\p{^L}+ and then you just need to use it to replace all non letters to \'-\'.Working example in node.js with xregex module.Brian\'s code, in Ruby:downcase turns the string to lowercase, strip removes leading and trailing whitespace, the first gsub call globally substitutes spaces with dashes, and the second removes everything that isn\'t a letter or a dash.There is a small Ruby on Rails plugin called PermalinkFu, that does this. The escape method does the transformation into a string that is suitable for a URL. Have a look at the code; that method is quite simple.To remove non-ASCII characters it uses the iconv lib to translate to \'ascii//ignore//translit\' from \'utf-8\'. Spaces are then turned into dashes, everything is downcased, etc.You can use the following helper method. It can convert the Unicode characters.Here\'s my (slower, but fun to write) version of Jeff\'s code:My test string:"  I love C#, F#, C++, and... Cr\xc3\xa8me br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e!!! They see me codin\'... they hatin\'... tryin\' to catch me codin\' dirty... "The stackoverflow solution is great, but modern browser (excluding IE, as usual) now handle nicely utf8 encoding:So I upgraded the proposed solution:Full Code on PastebinEdit: Here\'s the code for RemapInternationalCharToAscii method (that\'s missing in the pastebin).I liked the way this is done without using regular expressions, so I ported it to PHP. I just added a function called is_between to check characters:Now all Browser handle nicely utf8 encoding, so you can use WebUtility.UrlEncode Method , its like HttpUtility.UrlEncode used by @giamin but its work outside of a web application.No, no, no. You are all so very wrong. Except for the diacritics-fu stuff, you\'re getting there, but what about Asian characters (shame on Ruby developers for not considering their nihonjin brethren).Firefox and Safari both display non-ASCII characters in the URL, and frankly they look great. It is nice to support links like \'http://somewhere.com/news/read/\xe3\x81\x8a\xe5\x89\x8d\xe3\x81\x9f\xe3\x81\xa1\xe3\x81\xaf\xe3\x82\xa2\xe3\x83\x9b\xe3\x81\x98\xe3\x82\x83\xe3\x81\xaa\xe3\x81\x84\xe3\x81\x8b\xe3\x81\x84\'.So here\'s some PHP code that\'ll do it, but I just wrote it and haven\'t stress tested it.Example:Outputs:\n    \xe3\x82\xb3\xe3\x83\xaa\xe3\x83\xb3-and-\xe3\x83\x88\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x83\x9e\xe3\x82\xb9-and-\xe3\x82\xa2\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x83\x8e\xe3\x83\xab\xe3\x83\x89The \'-and-\' is because &\'s get changed to \'-and-\'.
