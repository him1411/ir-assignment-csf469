I need to add a shake feature that will refresh my Android application.All I find of documentation involves implementing the SensorListener, but Eclipse tells me it\'s deprecated and suggest SensorEventListener. Anybody that has a nice guide to how I go about creating this shake controller?Here is an example code.\nPut this into your activity class:And add this to your onCreate method:You can then ask "mAccel" wherever you want in your application for the current acceleration, independent from the axis and cleaned from static acceleration such as gravity.\nIt will be approx. 0 if there is no movement, and, lets say >2 if the device is shaked.Based on the comments - to test this:Notes:The accelometer should be deactivated onPause and activated onResume to save resources (CPU, Battery).\nThe code assumes we are on planet Earth ;-) and initializes the acceleration to earth gravity. Otherwise you would get a strong "shake" when the application starts and "hits" the ground from free-fall. However, the code gets used to the gravitation due to the low-cut filter and would work also on other planets or in free space, once it is initialized.\n(you never know how long your application will be in use...;-)Here is my code for shake gesture detection:Add this in your activity:...in onCreate() add:and:Here\'s yet another implementation that builds on some of the tips in here as well as the code from the Android developer site.MainActivity.javaShakeDetector.javaI really liked Peterdk\'s answer.  I took it upon myself to make a coulpe of tweaks to his code .file: ShakeDetector.javaAlso, don\'t forget that you need to register an instance of the ShakeDetector with the SensorManager.I am developing a motion-detection and shake-detection app for my university project.Besides the original target of the application, I am splitting the library part (responsible for motion and shake detection) from the app. The code is free, available on SourceForge with the project name "BenderCatch". Documentation I am producing will be ready around mid-september.\nhttp://sf.net/projects/bendercatchIt uses a more precise way to detect shake: watches BOTH the difference of force between SensorEvents AND the oscillations present in X and Y axis when you perform a shake. It can even make a sound (or vibrate) on each oscillation of the shake.Feel free to ask me more by e-mail at raffaele [at] terzigno [dot] comI have written a small example for detecting vertical and horizontal shakes and showing a Toast.I have tried several implementations, but would like to share my own.\nIt uses G-force as unit for the threshold calculation. It makes it a bit easier to understand what is going on, and also with setting a good threshold.It simply registers a increase in G force and triggers the listener if it exceeds the threshold. It doesn\'t use any direction thresholds, cause you don\'t really need that if you just want to register a good shake.Of-course you need the standard registering and UN-registering of this listener in the Activity. Also, to check what threshold you need, I recommend the following app (I am not in any way connected to that app)Here is another code for this:You can use seismic. An example can be found here.Shaker.java MainActivity.javaHave fun.You should subscribe as a SensorEventListener, and get the accelerometer data.\nonce you have it, you should monitor for sudden change in direction (sign) of acceleration on a certain axis. it would be a good indication for the \'shake\' movement.Working with me v.good\nReferenceYou might want to try open source tinybus. With it shake detection is as easy as this.It uses seismic for shake detection.
