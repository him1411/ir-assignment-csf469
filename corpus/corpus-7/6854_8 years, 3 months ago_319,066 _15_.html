Say a web page has a string such as "I am a simple string" that I want to find. How would I go about this using JQuery?jQuery has the contains method.  Here\'s a snippet for you:The selector above selects any element that contains the target string.  The foundin will be a jQuery object that contains any matched element.  See the API information at: http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/contains#textOne thing to note with the \'*\' wildcard is that you\'ll get all elements, including your html an body elements, which you probably don\'t want.  That\'s why most of the examples at jQuery and other places use $(\'div:contains("I am a simple string")\')Normally jQuery selectors do not search within the "text nodes" in the DOM. However if you use the .contents() function, text nodes will be included, then you can use the nodeType property to filter only the text nodes, and the nodeValue property to search the text string.This will select just the leaf elements that contain "I am a simple string".Paste the following into the address bar to test it.If you want to grab just "I am a simple string". First wrap the text in an element like so.and then do this.If you just want the node closest to the text you\'re searching for, you could use this:This will even work if your HTML looks like this:Using the above selector will find the <strong> tag, since that\'s the last tag which contains that entire string.Take a look at highlight (jQuery plugin).Just adding to Tony Miller\'s answer as this got me 90% towards what I was looking for but still didn\'t work. Adding .length > 0; to the end of his code got my script working.this function should work.  basically does a recursive lookup till we get a distinct list of leaf nodes.
