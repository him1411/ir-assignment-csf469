Suppose I have an array, for example:And later I want to push/append an element to the end of said array, to get:["Steve", "Bill", "Linus", "Bret", "Tim"]What method should I use?And what about the case where I want to add an element to the front of the array? Is there a constant time unshift?You had a couple of options for appending an element to an array. In early betas, you could use the += operator to append an individual element, but this is no longer the case. You can however still use the append function.If you\'re looking to append more elements from a different array to your array, you can still use the += operator, or the extend method.To insert a single object at the beginning of the array, you can use the insert method.To insert the contents of a different array at the beginning of an array, you can use the splice method.In the case of insert and insertContentsOf, the seconds argument can be any valid index of the receiving array.More information can be found in the "Collection Types" chapter of "The Swift Programming Language", starting on page 110.As of Swift 3, the above examples must be written as follows.To add a new element to the end of an Array.To append a different Array to the end of your Array.To insert a new element into your Array.To insert the contents of a different Array into your Array.To add to the end, use the += operator:That operator is equivalent to the append() method.There\'s also insert(:, atIndex:) for inserting at any index. (See Array Reference.)If, say, you\'d like a convenience function for inserting at the beginning, you could add it to the Array class with an extension.You can also pass in a variable and/or object if you wanted to.To add them to the front:As others have already stated, you can no longer use \'+=\' as of xCode 6.1Use += and + operators :then use :Here is a small extension if you wish to insert at the beginning of the array without loosing the item at the first positionTo add to the solutions suggesting append, it\'s useful to know that this is an amortised constant time operation in many cases:Complexity: Amortized O(1) unless self\'s storage is shared with another live array; O(count) if self does not wrap a bridged NSArray; otherwise the efficiency is unspecified.I\'m looking for a cons like operator for Swift. It should return a new immutable array with the element tacked on the end, in constant time, without changing the original array. I\'ve not yet found a standard function that does this. I\'ll try to remember to report back if I find one!
