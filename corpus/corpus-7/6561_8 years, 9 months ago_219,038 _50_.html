I\'m currently adding verbose tooltips to our site, and I\'d like (without having to resort to a whizz-bang jQuery plugin, I know there are many!) to use carriage returns to format the tooltip.To add the tip I\'m using the title attribute. I\'ve looked around the usual sites and using the basic template of:I\'ve tried replacing the ? with:None of the above works. Is it possible?It\'s so simple you\'ll kick yourself... just press enter!Firefox won\'t display multi-line tooltips at all though - it will replace the newlines with nothing.The latest specification allows line feed character, so a simple line break inside the attribute or entity &#10; (note that characters # and ; are required) are OK.This won\'t work in all current browsers, so make sure your text makes sense with newlines removed.Try character 10.  It won\'t work in Firefox though. :(The text is displayed (if at all) in a\n  browser dependent manner. Small\n  tooltips work on most browsers. Long\n  tooltips and line breaking work in IE\n  and Safari (use &#10; or &#13; for a\n  new newline). Firefox and Opera do not\n  support newlines. Firefox does not\n  support long tooltips.http://modp.com/wiki/htmltitletooltipsAs of January 2015 Firefox does support using &#13; to insert a line break in an HTML title attribute. See the snippet example below.Tested this in IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox (latest versions 2012-11-27):\n&#13;Works in all of them...Also worth mentioning, if you are setting the title attribute with Javascript like this:divElement.setAttribute("title", "Line one&#10;Line two");It won\'t work. You have to replace that ASCII decimal 10 to a ASCII hexadecimal A in the way it\'s escaped with Javascript. Like this:divElement.setAttribute("title", "Line one\\x0ALine two");As of Firefox 12 they now support line breaks using the line feed HTML entity: &#10;This works in IE and is the correct according to the HTML5 spec for the title attribute.If you are using jQuery :will work.tested in IE-9 : working.I don\'t believe it is. Firefox 2 trims long link titles anyway and they should really only be used to convey a small amount of help text. If you need more explanation text I would suggest that it belongs in a paragraph associated with the link. You could then add the tooltip javascript code to hide those paragraphs and show them as tooltips on hover. That\'s your best bet for getting it to work cross-browser IMO.&#13; will work in i.e. only&#xD;    <----- This is the text needed to insert Carry Return.Just use this:You can add new line on title by using this &#x0a.I know I\'m late to the party, but for those that just want to see this working, here\'s a demo: http://jsfiddle.net/rzea/vsp6840b/3/HTML used:As for whom &#10; didn\'t work you have to style the element on which lines are visible in as : white-space: pre-line;Referenced from this Answer : https://stackoverflow.com/a/17172412/1460591As a contribution to the &#013; solution, we can also use &#009 for tabs if you ever need to do something like this. On Chrome 16, and possibly earlier versions, you can use "\\n". As a sidenote, "\\t" also worksJust use JavaScript.  Then compatible with most and older browsers.\nUse the escape sequence \\n for newline.From the information available on accessibility and the use of tooltips making them larger with the use of CR or line break is appreciated, the fact that the various browsers cannot/will not agree on basics shows that they don\'t much care about accessibility. According to this article on the w3c website:CDATA is a sequence of characters from the document character set and\n  may include character entities. User agents should interpret attribute\n  values as follows:This means that (at least) CR and LF won\'t work inside title attribute. I suggest that you use a tooltip plugin. Most of these plugins allow arbitrary HTML to be displayed as an element\'s tooltip.We had a requirement where we needed to test all of these, here is what I wish to shareFiddlehack but works - (tested on chrome and mobile)just add no break spaces Â  till it breaks - you might have to limit the tooltip size depending on the amount of content but for small text messages this works:Tried everything above and this is the only thing that worked for me - Razor SyntaxIn the case of ASP.NET MVC you can just store the title as a variable as use \\r\\n and it\'ll work.
