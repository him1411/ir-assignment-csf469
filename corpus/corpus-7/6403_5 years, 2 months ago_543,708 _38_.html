This is crazy but I don\'t know how to do this, and because of how common the words are, it\'s hard to find what I need on search engines. I\'m thinking this should be an easy one to answer.I want a simple file download, that would do the same as this:But I want to use an HTML button, e.g. either of these:Likewise, is it possible to trigger a simple download via JavaScript?I\'m definitely not looking for a way to create an anchor that looks like a button, use any back-end scripts, or mess with server headers or mime types.For the button you can doI have done some research and found the best answer. You can trigger a download by using the new HTML5 download attribute.Where :Hope this is helpful.Whatwg DocumentationCaniuseWith jQuery:HTML:You can do it with "trick" with invisible iframe. When you set "src" to it, browser reacts as if you would click a link with the same "href". As opposite to solution with form, it enables you to embed additional logic, for example activating download after timeout, when some conditions are met etc. It is also very silient, there\'s no blinking new window/tab like when using window.open.HTML:Javascript:What about:Anywhere between your <body> and </body> tags, put in a button using the below code:This is sure to work!This is what finally worked for me since the file to be downloaded was determined when the page is loaded.JS to update the form\'s action attribute:Calling JS to update the form\'s action attribute:Form tag with the submit button:The following did NOT work:It doesn\'t seem to work in Safari, but it did work in Chrome. Also, changing the href attribute of the link once the user clicked it seemed to make it work in older versions of IE, but not in the latest versions of IE or Edge.You can hide the download link and make the button click it.I think this is the solution you were looking forI hade a case where my Javascript generated a CSV file. Since there is no remote URL to download it I use the following implementation.Another way of doing in case you have a complex URL such as file.doc?foo=bar&jon=doe is to add hidden field inside the forminspired on @Cfreak answer which is not completeIf you can\'t use form, another approach with downloadjs fit nice. Downloadjs use blob and html 5 file API under the hood:{downloadjs(url, filename)})/>*it\'s jsx/react syntax, but can be used in pure htmlIf you use the <a> tag, do not forget to use the entire url which leads to the file -- i.e.:For me ading button instead of anchor text works really well.It might not be ok by most rules, but it looks pretty good.Use a normal link and style it to look like a button, using CSS.
