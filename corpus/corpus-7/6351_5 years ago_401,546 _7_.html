I am creating a figure in Matplotlib like this:I want to specify font sizes for the figure title and the axis labels. I need all three to be different font sizes, so setting a global font size (mpl.rcParams[\'font.size\']=x) is not what I want. How do I set font sizes for the figure title and the axis labels individually?Functions dealing with text like label, title, etc. accept parameters same as matplotlib.text.Text. For the font size you can use size/fontsize:For globally setting title and label sizes, mpl.rcParams contains axes.titlesize and axes.labelsize. (From the page):(As far as I can see, there is no way to set x and y label sizes separately.)And I see that axes.titlesize does not affect suptitle. I guess, you need to set that manually.You can also do this globally via a rcParams dictionary:
