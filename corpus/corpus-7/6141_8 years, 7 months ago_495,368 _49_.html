I want to show an image from an URL with a certain width and height even if it has a different size ratio. \nSo I want to resize (maintaining the ratio) and then cut the image to the size I want.\n\nI can resize with html img property and I can cut with background-image.\n\nHow can I do both?Example:This image:\nHas the size 800x600 pixels and I want to show like an image of 200x100 pixels\nWith img I can resize the image 200x150px:\nThat gives me this:And with background-image I can cut the image 200x100 pixels.\nGives me:\nHow can I do both?\n\nResize the image and then cut it the size I want?You could use a combination of both methods eg.CSS:You can use negative margin to move the image around within the <div/>.With CSS3 it\'s possible to change the size of a background-image with background-size, fulfilling both goals at once.There are a bunch of examples on css3.info.Implemented based on your example, using donald_duck_4.jpg. In this case, background-size: cover; is just what you want - it fits the background-image to cover the entire area of the containing <div> and clips the excess (depending on the ratio).css3 background-image background-sizeDid you try to use this?.centered-and-cropped { object-fit: cover }I needed to resize image, center (both vertically and horizontally) and than crop it.I was happy to find, that it could be done in a single css-line. \nCheck the example here: http://codepen.io/chrisnager/pen/azWWgr/?editors=110Here is the CSS and HTMLcode from that example:  CSS: \nHTML: The containing div with essentially crop the image by hiding the overflow.Thanks sanchothefat.I have an improvement to your answer. As crop is very tailored for every image, this definitions should be at the HTML instead of CSS.In the crop class, place the image size that you want to appear:The html will look like:Live Example:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/de4Lt57z/HTML:CSS:Explanation:\nHere image is resized by width and height value of the image. And crop is done by clip property.For details about clip property follow: \nhttp://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/01/16/understanding-the-css-clip-property/You can put the img tag in a div tag and do both, but I would recommend against scaling images in the browser.  It does a lousy job most of the time because browsers have very simplistic scaling algorithms.  Better to do your scaling in Photoshop or ImageMagick first, then serve it up to the client nice and pretty.What I\'ve done is to create a server side script that will resize and crop a picture on the server end so it\'ll send less data across the interweb.It\'s fairly trivial, but if anyone is interested, I can dig up and post the code (asp.net)There are services like Filestack that will do this for you. They take your image url and allow you to resize it using url parameters.  It is pretty easy.Your image would look like this after resizing to 200x100 but keeping the aspect ratioThe whole url looks like thisbut the important part is justIf you are using Bootstrap, try using {  background-size: cover;\n} for the <div> maybe give the div a class say <div class="example" style=url(\'../your_image.jpeg\');> so it becomes \ndiv.example{\nbackground-size: cover}
