I\'ve noticed that when using $.post() in jquery that the default contentType is application/x-www-form-urlencoded - when my asp.net mvc code needs to have contentType=application/json(See this question for why I must use application/json: ASPNET MVC - Why is ModelState.IsValid false "The x field is required" when that field does have a value?)How can I make $.post() send contentType=application/json? I already have a large number of $.post() functions, so I don\'t want to change to $.ajax() because it would take too much timeIf I tryIt still has contentType=application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  So what exactly does the "json" param do if it does not change the contenttype to json?If I tryThat works but affects every single $.get and $.post that I have and causes some to break. So is there some way that I can change the behavior of $.post() to send contentType=application/json?I think you may have to 1.Modify the source to make $.post always use JSON data type as it really is just a shortcut for a pre configured $.ajax callOr 2.Define your own utility function that is a shortcut for the $.ajax configuration you want to use Or3.You could overwrite the $.post function with your own implementation via monkey patching.The JSON datatype in your example refers to the datatype returned from the server and not the format sent to the server.See : jQuery.ajax()Finally I found the solution, that works for me:I ended up adding the following method to jQuery in my script:And to use itThis was done by simply copying the code of "get" and "post" from the original JQuery sources and hardcoding a few parameters to force a JSON POST.Thanks!use justUPDATED @JK: If you write in your question only one code example with $.post you find one corresponding example in the answer. I don\'t want to repeat the same information which you already studied till know: $.post and $.get are short forms of $.ajax. So just use $.ajax and you can use the full set of it\'s parameters without having to change any global settings.By the way I wouldn\'t recommend overwriting the standard $.post. It\'s my personal opinion, but for me it\'s important, not only that the program works, but also that all who read your program understand it with the same way. Overwriting standard methods without having a very important reason can follow to misunderstanding in reading of the program code. So I repeat my recommendation one more time: just use the original $.ajax form jQuery instead of jQuery.get and jQuery.post and you receive programs which not only perfectly work, but can be read by people without any misunderstandings.The "json" datatype that you can pass as the last parameter to post() indicates what type of data the function is expecting in the server\'s response, not what type it\'s sending in the request. Specifically it sets the "Accept" header.Honestly your best bet is to switch to an ajax() call.  The post() function is meant as a convenience; a simplified version of the ajax() call for when you are just doing a simple form posting.  You aren\'t.If you really don\'t want to switch, you could make your own function called, say, xpost(), and have it simply transform the given parameters into parameters for a jQuery ajax() call, with the content-type set.  That way, rather than rewriting all of those post() functions into ajax() functions, you just have to change them all from post to xpost (or whatever).I know this is a late answer, I actually have a shortcut method that I use for posting/reading to/from MS based services.. it works with MVC as well as ASMX etc...Use:NOTE: I also have a JSON.parseAjax method that is modified from json.org\'s JS file, that adds handling for the MS "/Date(...)/" dates...The modified json2.js file isn\'t included, it uses the script based parser in the case of IE8, as there are instances where the native parser breaks when you extend the prototype of array and/or object, etc.I\'ve been considering revamping this code to implement the promises interfaces, but it\'s worked really well for me.At the heart of the matter is the fact that JQuery at the time of writing does not have a postJSON method while getJSON exists and does the right thing. a postJSON method would do the following:and can be used like this:How about your own adapter/wrapper ?And extremely simple usage:The documentation currently shows that as of 3.0, $.post will accept the settings object, meaning that you can use the $.ajax options. 3.0 is not released yet and on the commit they\'re talking about hiding the reference to it in the docs, but look for it in the future!I had a similar issue with the following JavaScript code:Where in the Fiddler I could see the request with:As a result, my server couldn\'t map an object to a server-side type.After changing the last line to this one:In the Fiddler I could still see:However, the server started returning what I expected.You can\'t send application/json directly -- it has to be a parameter of a GET/POST request.So something like
