How to disable back button in android while logging out the application?Override the onBackPressed method and do nothing if you meant to handle the back button on the device.Requires API Level 5 or higher.If looking for android api level upto 1.6.And if looking for a higher api level 2.0 and above\nthis will work greatwrite this code in your Activity to prevent back button pressedYou can do this simple way Don\'t call super.onBackPressed()Simply override the onBackPressed() method.If you want to make sure your android client application is logged out from some server before your Activity gets killed --> log out with a service on its own thread (that\'s what you\'re supposed to do anyway).Disabling the back button won\'t solve anything for you. You\'ll still have the same problem when the user receives a phone call for instance. When a phone call is received, your activity has about as much chances of getting killed before it gets a reliable answer back from the network.  That\'s why you should let a service wait on its own thread for the answer from the network, and then make it try again if it doesn\'t succeed. The android service is not only much less likely to get killed before it gets an answer back, but should it really get killed before finishing the job, it can always get revived by AlarmManager to try again.I am using it.............if you are using FragmentActivity. then do like thisfirst call This inside your Fragment.and then Call onBackPressed method in side your parent FragmentActivity class.If you want to disable your app while logging out, you can pop up a non-cancellable dialog.You just need to override the method for back button. You can leave the method empty if you want so that nothing will happen when you press back button. Please have a look at the code below:For me just overriding onBackPressed() did not work but explicit pointing which activity it should start worked well:Apart form these two methods from answer above.onBackPressed() (API Level 5, Android 2.0)onKeyDown() (API Level 1, Android 1.0)You can also override the dispatchKeyEvent()(API Level 1, Android 1.0) like this,dispatchKeyEvent() (API Level 1, Android 1.0)
