What method should I call to know if an Activity has its contentView (once the method setContentView() has been called)?ororYou can get the view Back if you put an ID to your Layout.And call it from findViewById ...You may want to try View.getRootView().How aboutYou can also override onContentChanged() which is among others fired when setContentView() has been called.There is no "isContentViewSet" method. You may put some dummy requestWindowFeature call into try/catch block before setContentView like this:If content view was already set, requestWindowFeature will throw an exception.The best option I found and the less intrusive, is to set a tag param in your xml, likePHONE XML LAYOUTTABLET XML LAYOUTand then call this in your activity class:Hope it works for u.
