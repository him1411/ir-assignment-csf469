I have some .sql files with thousands of INSERT statements in them and need to run these inserts on my PostgreSQL database in order to add them to a table. The files are that large that it is impossible to open them and copy the INSERT statements into an editor window and run them there. I found on the Internet that you can use the following by navigating to the bin folder of your PostgreSQL install:In my case:I am then asked for a password for my user, but I cannot enter anything and when I hit enter I get this error:psql: FATAL: password authentication failed for user "myUsername"Why won\'t it let me enter a password. Is there a way round this as it is critical that I can run these scripts?I got around this issue by adding a new entry in my pg_hba.conf file with the following structure:The pg_hba.conf file can usually be found in the \'data\' folder of your PostgreSQL install.You have four choices to supply a password:Of course, you will get a fatal error for authenticating, because you do not include a user name...Try this one, it is OK for me :)You should do it like this:See:Via the terminal log on to your database and try this:ororUse this to execute *.sql files when the PostgreSQL server is located in a difference place:Then you are prompted to enter the password of the user.Walk through on how to run an SQL on the command line for PostgreSQL in Linux:Open a terminal and make sure you can run the psql command:Mine is version 9.1.6 located in /bin/psql.Create a plain textfile called mysqlfile.sqlEdit that file, put a single line in there:Run this command on commandline (substituting your username and the name of your database for pgadmin and kurz_prod):The following is the result I get on the terminal (I am not prompted for a password):You can give both user name and PASSSWORD on the command line itself.You can open a command prompt and run as administrator. Then type Password for user postgres: will show up.Type your password and enter. I couldn\'t see the password what I was typing, but this time when I press enter it worked. Actually I was loading data into the database.you could even do it in this way:\n\nsudo - postgres psql -d myDataBase -a -f myInsertFile\n\nif you have sudo access on machine and it\'s not recommended for production scripts just for test on your own machine it\'s the easiest way.
