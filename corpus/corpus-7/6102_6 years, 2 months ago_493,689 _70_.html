I want to install pip. It should support Python 3, but it requires setuptools, which is available only for Python 2.How can I install pip with Python 3?edit: Manual installation and use of setuptools is not the standard process anymore.Congrats, you should already have pip installed. If you do not, read onward.You can usually install the package for pip through your package manager if your version of Python is older than 2.7.9 or 3.4, or if your system did not include it for whatever reason.Instructions for some of the more common distros follow.Run the following command from a terminal:Run the following command from a terminal:On CentOS 7, you have to install setup tools first, and then use that to install pip, as there is no direct package for it.Assuming you installed Python 3.4 from EPEL, you can install Python 3\'s setup tools and use it to install pip.Install using the manual way detailed below.If you want to do it the manual way, the now-recommended method is to install using the get-pip.py script from pip\'s installation instructions.Install pipTo install pip, securely download get-pip.pyThen run the following (which may require administrator access):If setuptools is not already installed, get-pip.py will install setuptools for you.I was able to install pip for python 3 on Ubuntu just by running sudo apt-get install python3-pip. Good news! Python 3.4 (released March 2014) ships with Pip. This is the best feature of any Python release. It makes the community\'s wealth of libraries accessible to everyone. Newbies are no longer excluded by the prohibitive difficulty of setup. In shipping with a package manager, Python joins Ruby, Nodejs, Haskell, Perl, Go--almost every other contemporary language with a majority open-source community. Thank you Python.Of course, that doesn\'t mean Python packaging is problem solved. The experience remains frustrating. I discuss this at Does Python have a package/module management system?Alas for everyone using an earlier Python. Manual instructions follow.Follow my detailed instructions at  https://stackoverflow.com/a/12476379/284795 . EssentiallyPer https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing.htmlDownload get-pip.py, being careful to save it as a .py file rather than .txt. Then, run it from the command prompt.You possibly need an administrator command prompt to do this. Follow http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc947813(v=ws.10).aspxFor me, this installed Pip at C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\pip.exe. Find pip.exe on your computer, then add its folder (eg.  C:\\Python27\\Scripts) to your path (Start / Edit environment variables). Now you should be able to run pip from the command line. Try installing a package:There you go (hopefully)! For Ubuntu 12.04 or older, won\'t work. Instead, use:As per https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html the current way is:I think that should work for any versionI\'m not sure when exactly this was introduced, but it\'s installed pip3 for me when it didn\'t already exist.To install packages in Python always follow these steps:Note: This is assuming no alias is set for pythonThrough this method, there will be no confusion regarding which python version is receiving the package.if you\'re using python 3.4+just type:If you use several different versions of python try using virtualenv http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html#installationWith the advantage of pip for each local environment.Then install a local environment in the current directory by:Note that you specify the path to a python binary you have installed on your system.Then there are now an local pythonenvironment in that folder. ./ENVNow there should be ./ENV/pip-3.3use \n./ENV/pip-3.3 freeze to list the local installed libraries.use ./ENV/pip-3.3 install packagename to install at the local environment.use ./ENV/python3.3 pythonfile.py to run your python script.Here is my way to solve this problem at ubuntu 12.04:Then install the python3 from source code:When you finished installing all of them, pip3 will get installed automatically.This is what I did on OS X Mavericks to get this to work.Firstly, have brew installedInstall python 3.4Then I get the latest version of distribute:I hope this helps.For python3 try this:The good thing is that It will also detect what version of python you have (even if it\'s an environment of python in your custom location).\nAfter this you can proceed normally with (for example)source:\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/1.1.6#upgrading-from-setuptools-0-6Assuming you are in a highly restricted computer env (such as myself) without root access or ability to install packages...  I had never setup a fresh/standalone/raw/non-root instance of Python+virtualenv before this post.  I had do quite a bit of Googling to make this work.Then... pip, pip, pip!Final tip to newbie Pythoneers: You don\'t think you need virtualenv when you start, but you will be happy to have it later.  Helps with "what if" installation / upgrade scenarios for open source / shared packages.Ref: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.htmlWhat\xe2\x80\x99s New In Python 3.4pip should always be availableBy default, the commands pipX and pipX.Y will be installed on all platforms (where X.Y stands for the version of the Python installation), along with the pip Python package and its dependencies.https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html#whatsnew-pep-453so if you have python 3.4 installed, you can just: sudo pip3 install xxxTo install pip, securely download get-pip.py.Then run the following:Be cautious if you\'re using a Python install that\'s managed by your\n  operating system or another package manager. get-pip.py does not\n  coordinate with those tools, and may leave your system in an\n  inconsistent state.Refer: PIP Installation
