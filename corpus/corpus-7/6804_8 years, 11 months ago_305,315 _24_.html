The UPSERT operation either updates or inserts a row in a table, depending if the table already has a row that matches the data:Since Oracle doesn\'t have a specific UPSERT statement, what\'s the best way to do this?The MERGE statement  merges data between two tables.  Using DUAL\nallows us to use this command.The dual example above which is in PL/SQL was great becuase I wanted to do something similar, but I wanted it client side...so here is the SQL I used to send a similar statement direct from some C#However from a C# perspective this provide to be slower than doing the update and seeing if the rows affected was 0 and doing the insert if it was.Another alternative without the exception check:An alternative to MERGE (the "old fashioned way"):None of the answers given so far is safe in the face of concurrent accesses, as pointed out in Tim Sylvester\'s comment, and will raise exceptions in case of races. To fix that, the insert/update combo must be wrapped in some kind of loop statement, so that in case of an exception the whole thing is retried.As an example, here\'s how Grommit\'s code can be wrapped in a loop to make it safe when run concurrently:N.B. In transaction mode SERIALIZABLE, which I don\'t recommend btw, you might run into\nORA-08177: can\'t serialize access for this transaction exceptions instead.I\'d like Grommit answer, except it require dupe values. I found solution where it may appear once: http://forums.devshed.com/showpost.php?p=1182653&postcount=2A note regarding the two solutions that suggest:1) Insert, if exception then update,or2) Update, if sql%rowcount = 0 then insertThe question of whether to insert or update first is also application dependent.  Are you expecting more inserts or more updates?  The one that is most likely to succeed should go first.  If you pick the wrong one you will get a bunch of unnecessary index reads.  Not a huge deal but still something to consider.I\'ve been using the first code sample for years. Notice notfound rather than count.The code below is the possibly new and improved codeIn the first example the update does an index lookup. It has to, in order to update the right row. Oracle opens an implicit cursor, and we use it to wrap a corresponding insert so we know that the insert will only happen when the key does not exist. But the insert is an independent command and it has to do a second lookup. I don\'t know the inner workings of the merge command but since the command is a single unit, Oracle could have execute the correct insert or update with a single index lookup.I think merge is better when you do have some processing to be done that means taking data from some tables and updating a table, possibly inserting or deleting rows. But for the single row case, you may consider the first case since the syntax is more common.Try this,From http://www.praetoriate.com/oracle_tips_upserts.htm:"In Oracle9i, an UPSERT can accomplish this task in a single statement:"
