On general request, a community wiki on producing latex tables in R. In this post I\'ll give an overview of the most commonly used packages and blogs with code for producing latex tables from less straight-forward objects. Please feel free to add any I missed, and/or give tips, hints and little tricks on how to produce nicely formatted latex tables with R.I\'d like to add a mention of the "brew" package. You can write a brew template file which would be LaTeX with placeholders, and then "brew" it up to create a .tex file to \\include or \\input into your LaTeX. Something like:The brew syntax can also handle loops, so you can create a table row for each row of a dataframe.Thanks Joris for creating this question. Hopefully, it will be made into a community wiki. The booktabs packages in latex produces nice looking tables. Here is a blog post on how to use xtable to create latex tables that use booktabsI would also add the apsrtable package to the mix as it produces nice looking regression tables.Another Idea: Some of these packages (esp. memisc and apsrtable) allow easy extensions of the code to produce tables for different regression objects. One such example is the lme4 memisc code shown in the question. It might make sense to start a github repository to collect such code snippets, and over time maybe even add it to the memisc package. Any takers?The stargazer package is another good option. It supports objects from many commonly used functions and packages (lm, glm, svyreg, survival, pscl, AER), as well as from zelig. In addition to regression tables, it can also output summary statistics for data frames, or directly output the content of data frames.I have a few tricks and work arounds to interesting \'features\' of xtable and Latex that I\'ll share here.Trick #1: Removing Duplicates in Columns and Trick #2: Using BooktabsFirst, load packages and define my clean functionNow generate some fake dataNow we can generate a table, and use the clean function to remove duplicate entries in the label columns.   this is a normal xtablethis is a normal xtable where a custom function has turned duplicates to NAThis table uses the booktab package (and needs a \\usepackage{booktabs} in the headers)Two utilities in package taRifx can be used in concert to produce multi-row tables of nested heirarchies.... and Trick #3 Multiline entries in an XtableGenerate some more dataNow produce our xtable, using the sanitize function to replace column names with the correct Latex newline commands (including double backslashes so R is happy)(although this isn\'t perfect, as we need \\tabularnewline so the table is formatted correctly, and Xtable still puts in a final \\, so we end up with a blank line below the table header.)You can also use the latextable function from the R package micsFuncs:http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/miscFuncs/index.htmllatextable(M) where M is a matrix with mixed alphabetic and numeric entries outputs a basic LaTeX table onto screen, which can be copied and pasted into a LaTeX document. Where there are small numbers, it also replaces these with index notation (eg 1.2x10^{-3}).Another R package for aggregating multiple regression models into LaTeX tables is texreg.
