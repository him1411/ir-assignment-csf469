I have to look at the last few lines of a large file (typical size is 500MB-2GB). I am looking for a equivalent of Unix command tail for Windows Powershell. A few alternatives available on are,http://tailforwin32.sourceforge.net/andFor me, it is not allowed to use the first alternative, and the second alternative is slow. Does anyone know of an efficient implementation of tail for PowerShell.Use the -wait parameter with Get-Content, which displays lines as they are added to the file. This feature was present in PowerShell v1, but for some reason not documented well in v2.Here is an exampleOnce you run this, update and save the file and you will see the changes on the console.As of PowerShell version 3.0, the Get-Content cmdlet has a -Tail parameter that should help. See the technet library online help for Get-Content.For completeness I\'ll mention that Powershell 3.0 now has a -Tail flag on Get-Contentgets the last 10 lines of the filegets the last 10 lines of the file and waits for morePowerShell Community Extensions (PSCX) provides the Get-FileTail cmdlet. It looks like a suitable solution for the task. Note: I did not try it with extremely large files but the description says it efficiently tails the contents and it is designed for large log files.I used some of the answers given here but just a heads up that will chew up memory after awhile. A colleague left such a "tail" up over the last day and it went up to 800 MB.  I don\'t know if Unix tail behaves the same way (but I doubt it).  So it\'s fine to use for short term applications, but be careful with it.Just some additions to previous answers. There are aliases defined for Get-Content, for example if you are used to UNIX you might like cat, and there are also type and gc. So instead of you can writeI took @hajamie\'s solution and wrapped it up into a slightly more convenient script wrapper. I added an option to start from an offset before the end of the file, so you can use the tail-like functionality of reading a certain amount from the end of the file. Note the offset is in bytes, not lines. There\'s also an option to continue waiting for more content. Examples (assuming you save this as TailFile.ps1):And here is the script itself...Using Powershell V2 and below, get-content reads the entire file, so it was of no use to me.  The following code works for what I needed, though there are likely some issues with character encodings.  This is effectively tail -f, but it could be easily modified to get the last x bytes, or last x lines if you want to search backwards for line breaks.  I found most of the code to do this here.  Very basic, but does what you need without any addon modules or PS version requirements:while ($true) {Clear-Host; gc E:\\test.txt | select -last 3; sleep 2 }
