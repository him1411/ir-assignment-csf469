What is the correct way to find the absolute path to the App_Data folder from a Controller in an ASP.NET MVC project? I\'d like to be able to temporarily work with an .xml file and I don\'t want to hardcode the path.This does not work:  I think outside of the web context VirtualPathUtility.ToAbsolute() doesn\'t work.\nstring path comes back as "C:\\App_Data\\somedata.xml"Where should I determine the path of the .xml file in an MVC app?\nglobal.asax and stick it an application-level variable?HttpServerUtility.MapPath MethodThis is the most "correct" way of getting it.I try to get in the habit of using HostingEnvironment instead of Server as it works within the context of WCF services too. Phil Haak has an example that I think is a bit more stable when dealing with paths with crazy "\\" style directory separators. It also safely handles path concatenation. It comes for free in System.IOHowever, you could also try "AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirector" instead of "Server.MapPath".The most correct way is to use HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath("~/App_Data");. This means you can only retrieve the path from a method where the HttpContext is available. It makes sense: the App_Data directory is a web project folder structure [1].If you need the path to ~/App_Data from a class where you don\'t have access to the HttpContext you can always inject a provider interface using your IoC container:Implement it using your HttpApplication:Where MyHttpApplication.GetAppDataPath looks like:[1] http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ex526337%28v=vs.100%29.aspxOR
