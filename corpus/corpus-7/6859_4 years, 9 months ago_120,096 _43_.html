Is there a way to save GITHUB\'s user credentials with TortoiseGit?It prompts me the below dialog every time whenever I do a push/pull.I would like to save my user credential information somewhere like how I did with TortoiseSVN.For TortoiseGit 1.8.1.2 or later, there is a GUI to switch on/off credential helper.It supports git-credential-wincred and git-credential-winstore.TortoiseGit 1.8.16 add support for git-credential-manager (Git Credential Manager, the successor of git-credential-winstore)For the first time you sync you are asked for user and password, you enter them and they will be saved to Windows credential store. It won\'t ask for user or password the next time you sync.To use: Right click → TortoiseGit → Settings → Git → Credential. Select Credential helper: wincred - this repository only / wincred - current Windows userIf you\'re going to downvote this answerI wrote this a few months prior to the inclusion of git-credential in TortoiseGit. Given the number of large security holes found in the last few years and how much I\'ve learned about network security, I would HIGHLY recommend you use a unique (minimum 2048-bit RSA) SSH key for every server you connect to.The below syntax is still available, though there are far better tools available today like git-credential that the accepted answer tells you how to use. Do that instead.Try changing the remote URL to https://username@github.com/username/repo.git where username is your github username and repo is the name of your repository.If you also want to store your password (not recommended), the URL would look like this: https://username:password@github.com/username/repo.git.There\'s also another way to store the password from this github help article: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#password-cachingNone of the above answers worked for me using git version 1.8.3.msysgit.0 and TortoiseGit 1.8.4.0.In my particular situation, I have to connect to the remote git repo over HTTPS, using a full blown e-mail address as username.\nIn this situation, wincred did not appear to work.Using the email address as a part of the repo URL also did not work, as the software seems to be confused by the double appearance of the \'@\' character in the URL.I did manage to overcome the problem using winstore. Here is what I did:This will copy the git-credential-winstore.exe to a local directory and add two lines to your global .gitconfig. You can verify this by examining your global .gitconfig. This is easiest done via right mouse button on a folder, "TortoiseGit > Settings > Git > Edit global .gitconfig". The file should contain two lines like:You are now ready to go:Done!\nEnjoy your interactions with the remote repo while winstore takes care of the authentication.(*) Alternatively, if you don\'t like the blank selection in the TortoiseGit Credential settings helper pull down menu, you can use the "Advanced" option:Enter the Helper path as below. Note: a regular Windows path notation (e.g. "C:\\Users...") will not work here, you have to replicate the exact line that installing winstore created in the global .gitconf without the "helper =" bit.Click the "Add New/Save" buttonFor msysgit 1.8.0, download git-credential-wincred.exe from https://github.com/downloads/msysgit/git/git-credential-wincred.zip and put into C:\\Program Files\\Git\\libexec\\git-coreFor msysgit 1.8.1 and later, the exe is built-in.in git config, add the following settings.[credential]\nhelper = wincredSaving username and password with TortoiseGitSaving your login details in TortoiseGit is pretty easy.  Saves having to type in your username and password every time you do a pull or push.Create a file called _netrc with the following contents:machine github.com\nlogin   yourlogin\npassword yourpasswordCopy the file to C:\\Users\\ (or another location; this just happens to be where I\xe2\x80\x99ve put it)Go to command prompt, type setx home C:\\Users\\Note: if you\xe2\x80\x99re using something earlier than Windows 7, the setx command may not work for you.  Use set instead and add the home environment variable to Windows using via the Advanced Settings under My Computer.CREDIT TO:\nhttp://www.munsplace.com/blog/2012/07/27/saving-username-and-password-with-tortoisegit/[open git settings (TortoiseGit \xe2\x86\x92 Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Git)][1][In GIt: click to edit global .gitconfig][2]config username and passwordThis wtry this,\nRight-click --> Tortoise Git --> Settings --> Git --> Credential --> Choose "Wincred, all Windows users" --> Hit applyit will ask password only once.
