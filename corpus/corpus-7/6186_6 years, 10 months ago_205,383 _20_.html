I have a table with columns name, qty, rate. Now I need to add a new column COLNew in between the name and qty columns. How do I add a new column in between two columns?You have two options.\nFirst, you could simply add a new column with the following:Second, and more complicatedly, but would actually put the column where you want it, would be to rename the table:Then create the new table with the missing column:And populate it with the old data:Then delete the old table:I\'d much prefer the second option, as it will allow you to completely rename everything if need be.You don\'t add columns between other columns in SQL, you just add them. Where they\'re put is totally up to the DBMS. The right place to ensure that columns come out in the correct order is when you select them.In other words, if you want them in the order {name,colnew,qty,rate}, you use:With SQLite, you need to use alter table, an example being:SQLite has limited ALTER TABLE support that you can use to add a column to the end of a table or to change the name of a table. If you want to make more complex changes in the structure of a table, you will have to recreate the table. You can save existing data to a temporary table, drop the old table, create the new table, then copy the data back in from the temporary table.For example, suppose you have a table named "t1" with columns names "a" and "c" and that you want to insert column "b" from this table. The following steps illustrate how this could be done: Now you are ready to insert your new data like so:You can add new column with the queryBut it will be added at the end, not in between the existing columns.This update is required to handle the null value, inputting a default value as you require. As in your case, you need to call the SELECT query and you will get the order of columns, as paxdiablo already said: and in my opinion, your column name to get the value from the cursor:so if the index changes your application will not face any problems.This is the safe way in the sense that otherwise, if you are using CREATE temptable or RENAME table or CREATE, there would be a high chance of data loss if not handled carefully, for example in the case where your transactions occur while the battery is running out.
