What is the difference between the && and and operators in Ruby?and is the same as && but with lower precedence. They both use short-circuit evaluation.WARNING: and even has lower precedence than = so you\'ll want to avoid and alwaysThe practical difference is binding strength, which can lead to peculiar behavior if you\'re not prepared for it:The same thing works for || and or.The Ruby Style Guide says it better than I could:Use &&/|| for boolean expressions, and/or for control flow. (Rule of\n  thumb: If you have to use outer parentheses, you are using the wrong\n  operators.)|| and && bind with the precedence that you expect from boolean operators in programming languages (&& is very strong, || is slightly less strong).and and or have lower precedence.For example, unlike ||,  or has lower precedence than =:Likewise, unlike &&, and also has lower precedence than =:What\'s more, unlike && and ||, and and or bind with equal precedence:The weakly-binding and and or may be useful for control-flow purposes: see http://devblog.avdi.org/2010/08/02/using-and-and-or-in-ruby/ .and has lower precedence than &&.But for an unassuming user, problems might occur if it is used along with other operators  whose precedence are in between, eg the assignment operator.egand has lower precedence, mostly we use it as control-flow modifier such as ifbecomesfor orbecomesI prefer to use if but not and, because if is more intelligible, so I just ignore and and or.Reference To Using \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d in Ruby
