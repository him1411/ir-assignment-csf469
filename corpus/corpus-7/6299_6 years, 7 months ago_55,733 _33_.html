I love the git blame command, it is very useful for tracking down people who don\'t own up to writing code. :-)However, is it possible to see who edited a specific line before the commit reported by git blame, e.g. a history of commits for a given line?For example, I run the following (on the superb uncrustify project):How can I find out who edited that line before commit fe25b6d? And who edited it before that commit? I am sure this would be possible, but my git-fu is weak.You can specify a revision for git blame to look back starting from (instead of the default of HEAD); fe25b6d^ is the parent of fe25b6d.You can use git log -L to view the evolution of a range of lines.For example :means "trace the evolution of lines 15 to 23 in the file named filename.txt".Building on the previous answer, this bash one-liner should give you what you\'re looking for. It displays the git blame history for a particular line of a particular file, through the last 5 revisions:In the output of this command, you might see the content of the line change, or the line number displayed might even change, for a particular commit.This often indicates that the line was added for the first time, after that particular commit. It could also indicate the line was moved from another part of the file.Amber\'s answer is correct but I found it unclear; The syntax is:Note: the -- is used to separate the tree-ish sha1 from the relative file paths. 1For example:Full credit to Amber for knowing all the things! :)There\'s also recursive-blame.  It can be installed withA very unique solution for this problem is using git log:git log -p -M --follow --stat -- path/to/your/fileAs explained by Andre hereYou might want to check out:Gives you a nice graphical display of changes like "git blame" but with clickable links per line, to move into earlier commits. Hover over the links to get a popup with commit details. Not my credits... found it here:http://zsoltfabok.com/blog/2012/02/git-blame-line-history/Building on Will Shepard\'s answer, his output will include duplicate lines for commits where there was no change, so you can filter those as as follows (using this answer)Note that I removed the REVS argument and this goes back to the root commit. This is due to Max Nanasy\'s observation above.Building on DavidN\'s answer and I want to follow renamed file:ref: nicely display file rename history in git logI use this little bash script to look at a blame history.First parameter: file to look atSubsequent parameters: Passed to git blameYou may supply blame-parameters like -L 70,+10 but it is better to use the regex-search of git blame because line-numbers typically "change" over time.Build on stangls\'s answer, I put this script in my PATH (even on Windows) as git-bh:That allows me to look for all commits where a word was involved:Script:
