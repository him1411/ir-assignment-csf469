I\'d like to know what to name my folder for different languages. Where can I find the supported list of languages on Android?As of Android 5.0, all languages in BCP 47 are available for application development (they may not necessarily be available for selection in a given device\'s system settings, though).  When using ISO 639-1 codes, the resource folder has the format values-xx... where xx is the ISO-639-1 code.  When using BCP 47 tags, the resource folder is named values-b+xxx... where xxx is the three-letter language code.Here\'s the list for before Android 2.3 (Source) *Note that Java uses several deprecated two-letter codes. The Hebrew (\xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x9d) >language code is rewritten as \xe2\x80\x9ciw\xe2\x80\x9d, Indonesian (\xe2\x80\x9cid\xe2\x80\x9d) as \xe2\x80\x9cin\xe2\x80\x9d, and Yiddish (\xe2\x80\x9cyi\xe2\x80\x9d) as \xe2\x80\x9cji\xe2\x80\x9d. This rewriting happens even if you construct your own Locale object, not just for instances returned by the various lookup methods. See also https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36908826.List of locales supported as of API 22 (Android 5.1). Obtained from a Nexus 5 with locale set to "English (United States)" (locale affects the DisplayName output).The best way to see the supported list is to start up the emulator in the latest version and open the "Custom Locale" app.  This will list all of the supported languages and locales for that version of Android.Update for 4.0Android 4.0.3 PlatformSOURCE: http://us.dinodirect.com/Forum/Latest-Posts-5/Android-Versions-and-their-Locales-1-86587/I think the best way is to run a sample code to find the supported locales.\nI\'ve made a code snippet that does it:the columns are : displayName (how it looks to the user), the locale, the variant, and the folder that the developer is supposed to put the strings into.Here\'s a table I\'ve made out of the 5.0.1 emulator:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hx1CTPT82qFSbzuWiU1nyGROCNM6HKssKCPhxinvdww/Weird thing is that for some cases, I got "#" which is something I\'ve never seen before. It\'s probably quite new, and the rule I\'ve chosen is probably incorrect for those cases (though it still compiles fine when I put such folders and files), but for the rest it should be fine.If anyone knows about what the "#" is, and how to handle it, please let me know.First we need to plan how the application will render differently in different locals.\nHere it shows example, where the text string and images have to go.For more info you can see the page Localizationhttp://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.htmlSee CLDR for specific language support.Ex : CLDR 1.8 for 2.3 http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-1-8Languages:Locale IDs can be found in:http://www.localeplanet.com/icu/Steps to follow Step 1 : Need to find which all Languages supported on Android Sol - follow my above answer ie in cldr-1-8 Languages.Step 2 : Since cldr-1-8 Languages does  not give u Locale short form which is need to be found for desire language \n Sol - Once language is available in cldr-1-8 Languages list then check for the shortform in http://www.localeplanet.com/icu/ linkExample :For language Hindi [\xe0\xa4\xb9\xe0\xa4\xbf\xe0\xa4\xa8\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xa6\xe0\xa5\x80] (1)we need to search its present in cldr-1-8 language then (2)search for Hindi in http://www.localeplanet.com/icu/ for Locale id\nits comes out to be http://www.localeplanet.com/icu/hi/index.html this link and see Locale id from it . Following jrub post on May 4 \'2015, I\'m adding updated locale list. \nExecuted on a Nexus 6P with Android 7.0 Nougat and English US locale.Here:I found a list, which might be the full list of supported locales by a given Android version (API level):\ngo to Android-sdk\\platforms\\android-[XX]\\data\\res\\values\\ where XX means the API level, and open locale_config.xml with any text editor.\nIt\'s human readable and can be easily processed if needed.
