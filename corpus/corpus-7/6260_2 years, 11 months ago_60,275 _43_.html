I tried to debug a release version of my Android application but Android Studio failed to attach a debugger. (It could not find Android procces of my running application).Under devices console, there was only a message:No debuggable applicationsYou also should have Tools->Android->Enable ADB Integration active.The solution is to turn on debuggable flag (debuggable true) in application\'s gradle file:After Android Studio synced Gradle with project files and reinstalled an application, the debugging start working.Just click the "Bug" icon and you will be good to go.I had the same problem and that did the trick.\nhope it helps someone.Check if Tools->Android->Enable ADB Integration is enabled. \nAlso disable and re-enabling it works most of the times.Believe it or not,a faulty USB cable can cause this problem to linger even if you follow all the suggestions here.Changing my USB cord did it for meI want to add one point to above 2 answers :If Eclipse IDE is running parallel to Android Studio then above answers may not help you. The debuggable application will not refresh event after setting debuggable true in Gradle file.So, close Eclipse IDE and check in Android Studio. The debuggable application will refresh.Thank youif intellij or AS you should make sure your Build Variants Setting is debug.You should check also in your AndroidManifest.xml file that there is no option like android:debuggable="false" in your application tag.To make it work just remove this option.Ctrl+shift+A\nType Enable ADB Integration\nclick on toggle\nDoneThis is the problem I encountered.The AAR file you import may change the attribute of debuggable, So just remove the debuggable attribute in your Main App Manifest file.\nSee the picture:Working solution1.For testing run as debug if everything is correct process is attached and you can able to debug.Can see in the list2.If it says application not debuggable then alter gradle4 .If not toggle Tools->Android->Enable ADB Integration and make it enabled.5.Restart adb server 6.Dis connect and connect device It will list Click the green bug, but make sure the drop down is set to app, if not it will not deploy your app, and just say something about. Connected to the target VM, address: \'localhost:xxx\', transport:\n  \'socket\'Make sure your build variant is set to "debug". And debug has debuggable true on your build.gradle fileI used Mac to run Android Studio. I agree with @Kushal, I did not open Eclipse though.\nI shut off Parallels Desktop and other APPs which may use the same Gradle.It happen to me when I wanted to debug my app after I Generated a Sign APK, so I had to change back the Build Variants value from release to debug. Multiple Options to do this:1.Tools->Android->Enable ADB IntegrationOR2.Build->Clean Project , the Build-> Rebuild Project.  Then "adb kill-server" and "adb start-server"One of above will work.
