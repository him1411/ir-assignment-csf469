How do you calculate the distance between two markers in Google maps V3? (Similar to the distanceFrom function inV2.)Thanks..If you want to calculate it yourself, then you can use the Haversine formula:There actually seems to be a method in GMap3. It\'s a static method of the google.maps.geometry.spherical namespace. It takes as arguments two LatLng objects and will utilize a default Earth radius of 6378137 meters, although the default radius can be overridden with a custom value if necessary.Make sure you include:in your head section.The call will be:There is the computeDistanceBetween(lat,lng) in the new V3 Geometry LibraryExample using GPS latitude/longitude of 2 points.Here is the c# implementation of the this forumulaJust add this to the beginning of your JavaScript code:and then use the function like this:With google you can do it using the spherical api, google.maps.geometry.spherical.computeDistanceBetween (latLngA, latLngB);. However, if the precision of a spherical projection or a haversine solution is not precise enough for you (e.g. if you\'re close to the pole or computing longer distances), you should use a different library.Most information on the subject I found on Wikipedia here.A trick to see if the precision of any given algorithm is adequate is to fill in the maximum and minimum radius of the earth and see if the difference might cause problems for your use case. Many more details can be found in this articleIn the end the google api or haversine will serve most purposes without problems.//p1 and p2 are google.maps.LatLng(x,y) objectsYou can get good accuracy at the cost of increased processing time with the Vincenty algorithm, implemented in Javascript.Using PHP, you can calculate the distance using this simple function : OFFLINE SOLUTION - Haversine AlgorithmIn JavascriptC#Reference:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distanceHad to do it... The action script wayIn my case it was best to calculate this in SQL Server, since i wanted to take current location and then search for all zip codes within a certain distance from current location. I also had a DB which contained a list of zip codes and their lat longs. CheersSee the distanceFrom function on the GLatLng object; the function parameters have slightly changed between v2 and v3.https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/distance-matrixThis code address name or cordinates resultTo calculate distance on Google Maps, you can use Directions API. That will be one of the easiest way to do it. To get data from Google Server, you can use Retrofit or Volley. Both has their own advantage. Take a look at following code where I have used retrofit to implement it:Above is the code of function build_retrofit_and_get_response for calculating distance. Below is corresponding Retrofit Interface:}I hope this explains your query. All the best :)Source: Google Maps Distance Calculator
