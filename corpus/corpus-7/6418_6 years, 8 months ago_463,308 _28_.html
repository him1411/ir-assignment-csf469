I know there are a few posts about Newtonsoft so hopefully this isn\'t exactly a repeat...I\'m trying to convert JSON data returned by Kazaa\'s API into a nice object of some kindThat JsonConvert line is just the most recent one I was trying...I\'m not quite getting it and was hoping to eliminate some footwork by asking you guys. I was originally trying to convert it into a Dictionary or something...and actually, I just need to snag a couple of values in there so judging by the documentation, maybe Newtonsoft\'s LINQ to JSON might be a better choice? Thoughts/Links?Here is an example of the JSON return data:I did some more reading and found Newtonsoft\'s LINQ to JSON is exactly what I wanted...using WebClient, Stream, StreamReader, and Newtonsoft...I can hit Kazaa for JSON data, extract a URL, download the file, and do it all in like seven lines of code! I love it.This post gets so many hits I thought it might be helpful to include the "using" bits that are discussed in the comments.If you just need to get a few items from the JSON object, I would use Json.NET\'s LINQ to JSON JObject class. For example:I like this approach because you don\'t need to fully deserialize the JSON object. This comes in handy with APIs that can sometimes surprise you with missing object properties, like Twitter.Documentation: Serializing and Deserializing JSON with Json.NET and LINQ to JSON with Json.NETYou can use the C# dynamic type to make things easier. This technique also makes re-factoring simpler as it does not rely on magic-strings.The JSON string below is a simple response from an HTTP API call, and it defines two properties: Id and Name.Use JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<dynamic>() to deserialize this string into a dynamic type then simply access its properties in the usual way.If you specify the type of the results variable as dynamic, instead of using the var keyword, then the property values will correctly deserialize, e.g. Id to an int and not a JValue (thanks to GFoley83 for the comment below).Note: The NuGet link for the Newtonsoft assembly is http://nuget.org/packages/newtonsoft.json.With the dynamic keyword, it becomes really easy to parse any object of this kind:Correct me if I\'m mistaken, but the previous example, I believe, is just slightly out of sync with the latest version of James Newton\'s Json.NET library.Deserialize and get the value (when the collection is dynamic):Also, if you\'re just looking for a specific value nested within the JSON content you can do something like so:And so on from there.This could help if you don\'t want to bear the cost of converting the entire JSON into a C# object.I like this method:You can now access anything you want using the dictObj as a dictionary. You can also use Dictionary<string, string> if you prefer to get the values as strings.You can use this same method to cast as any kind of .NET object.If, like me, you prefer to deal with strongly typed objects** go with:This way you get to use intellisense and compile time type error checking.You can easily create the required objects by copying your JSON into memory and pasting it as JSON objects (Visual Studio -> Edit -> Paste Special -> Paste JSON as Classes).See here if you don\'t have that option in Visual Studio.You will also need to make sure your JSON is valid. Add your own object at the start if it is just an array of objects. i.e. {"obj":[{},{},{}]}** I know that dynamic makes things easier sometimes but I\'m a bit ol\'skool with this.
