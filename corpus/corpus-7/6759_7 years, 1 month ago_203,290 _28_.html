What is the difference between var_dump() and print_r() in terms of spitting out an array as string?The var_dump function displays structured information about variables/expressions including its type and value. Arrays are explored recursively with values indented to show structure. It also shows which array values and object properties are references.The print_r() displays information about a variable in a way that\'s readable by humans. array values will be presented in a format that shows keys and elements. Similar notation is used for objects.Example:var_dump($obj) will display below output in the screen.And, print_r($obj) will display below output in the screen.More InfoGenerally,  print_r( ) output is nicer, more concise and easier to read, aka more human-readable but cannot show data types. With print_r() you can also store the output into a variable:which var_dump() cannot do. Yet var_dump() can show data types.var_dump() will show you the type of the thing as well as what\'s in it.So you\'ll get => [string]"var" Example is here.print_r() will just output the content.Would output => "var" Example is here.If you\'re asking when you should use what, I generally use print_r() for displaying values and var_dump() for when having issues with variable types.var_dump displays structured information about the object / variable. This includes type and values. Like print_r arrays are recursed through and indented.print_r displays human readable information about the values with a format presenting keys and elements for arrays and objects.The most important thing to notice is var_dump will output type as well as values while print_r does not.Significant differences between var_dump and print_rboth the functions dumps information about the variable, but var_dump multiple parameters which will be dumped, where as print_r can take two parameters out of which first parameter is the variable you want to dump and second is a boolean value.var_dump can\'t return any value it can only dump/print the values where as print_r can return the variable information if we set second parameter of print_r to true. The returned value of print_r will be in string format. The information printed by print_r is much more in readable format where as var_dump prints raw values.print_r function can be used in many contexts where as var_dump can be used in debugging purposes mainly since it can\'t return value.I\'d aditionally recommend putting the output of var_dump() or printr into a pre tag when outputting to a browser.Will give a more readable result.var_dump($var) shows in-depth details, by providing  additional details of With large arrays, print_r can show far more information than is useful. You can truncate it like this, showing the first 2000 characters or however many you need.print_r() and var_dump() are Array debugging functions used in PHP for debugging purpose. print_r() function returns the array keys and its members as Array([key] = value) whereas var_dump() function returns array list with its array keys with data type and length as well e.g Array(array_length){[0] = string(1)\'a\'}.
