How do I list all members of a group in Linux (and possibly other unices)?Unfortunately, there is no good, portable way to do this that I know of.  If you attempt to parse /etc/group, as others are suggesting, you will miss users who have that group as their primary group and anyone who has been added to that group via a mechanism other than UNIX flat files (i.e. LDAP, NIS, pam-pgsql, etc.).If I absolutely had to do this myself, I\'d probably do it in reverse: use id to get the groups of every user on the system (which will pull all sources visible to NSS), and use Perl or something similar to maintain a hash table for each group discovered noting the membership of that user.Edit: Of course, this leaves you with a similar problem: how to get a list of every user on the system.  Since my location uses only flat files and LDAP, I can just get a list from both locations, but that may or may not be true for your environment.Edit 2: Someone in passing reminded me that getent passwd will return a list of all users on the system including ones from LDAP/NIS/etc., but getent group still will still miss users that are members only via the default group entry, so that inspired me to write this quick hack.It is portable across both Linux and Solaris, and it works with local group/password files,  NIS, and LDAP configurations.Use Python to list groupmembers:python -c "import grp; print grp.getgrnam(\'GROUP_NAME\')[3]"See https://docs.python.org/2/library/grp.htmlThe following command will list all users belonging to <your_group_name>, but only those managed by /etc/group database, not LDAP, NIS, etc. It also works for secondary groups only, it won\'t list users who have that group set as primary since the primary group is stored as GID (numeric group ID) in the file /etc/passwd.The following command will list all users belonging to <your_group_name>, but only those managed by /etc/group database, not LDAP, NIS, etc. It also works for secondary groups only, it won\'t list users who have that group set as primary since the primary group is stored as GID (numeric group ID) in the file /etc/passwd.The following shell snippet will iterate through all users and print only those user names which belong to given $group.Note: This solution will check NIS and LDAP for users and groups (not only passwd and group files). It will also take into account users not added to a group but having group set as primary group.Edit: Added fix for rare scenario where user does not belong to group with the same name.just a little grep and tr:Zed\'s implementation should probably be expanded to work on some of the other major UNIX.Someone have access to Solaris or HP-UX hardware?; did not test those cases.If there is a better way to share this suggestion, please let me know; I considered many ways, and this is what I came up with.I\'ve done this similar to the perl code above, but replaced getent and id with native perl functions.  It is much faster and should work across different *nix flavors.You can do it in a single command line:Above command lists all the users having groupname as their primary groupIf you also want to list the users having groupname as their secondary group, use following commandThere is a handy Debian and Ubuntu package called \'members\' that provides this functionality:Description: Shows the members of a group; by default, all members\n   members is the complement of groups: whereas groups shows the groups a specified user belongs to, members shows users\n   belonging to a specified group. ... You can ask for primary members, secondary members, both on\n   one line, each on separate lines.Here is a script which returns a list of users from /etc/passwd and /etc/group\nit doesn\'t check NIS or LDAP, but it does show users who have the group as their default group\nTested on Debian 4.7 and solaris 9or as a one-liner you can cut and paste straight from here (change the group name in the first variable)In UNIX (as opposed to GNU/Linux), there\'s the listusers command. See the Solaris man page for listusers.Note that this command is part of the open-source Heirloom Project. I assume that it\'s missing from GNU/Linux because RMS doesn\'t believe in groups and permissions. :-)Here\'s a very simple awk script that takes into account all common pitfalls listed in the other answers:I\'m using this with my ldap-enabled setup, runs on anything with standards-compliant getent & awk, including solaris 8+ and hpux.I have tried grep \'sample-group-name\' /etc/group,that will list all the member of the group you specified based on the example hereThis returns a space separated list of users which I\'ve used in scripts to populate arrays.orThis has 3 parts:1 - getent group groupname shows the line of the group in "/etc/group" file. Alternative to cat /etc/group | grep groupname.2 - awk print\'s only the members in a single line separeted with \',\' .3 - tr replace\'s \',\' with a new line and print each user in a row.4 - Optional: You can also use another pipe with sort, if the users are too many.Regards
