How do you tell if a function in JavaScript is defined? I want to do something like thisbut it gets me acallback is not a functionerror when callback is not defined.All of the current answers use a literal string, which I prefer to not have in my code if possible - this does not (and provides valuable semantic meaning, to boot):Personally, I try to reduce the number of strings hanging around in my code...Also, while I am aware that typeof is an operator and not a function, there is little harm in using syntax that makes it appear as the latter.Note that callback (by itself) evaluates to false if it is undefined, null, 0, or false. Comparing to null is overly specific.New to JavaScript I am not sure if the behaviour has changed but the solution given by Jason Bunting (6 years ago) won\'t work if possibleFunction is not defined. This will throw a ReferenceError: possibleFunction is not defined error as the engine tries to resolve the symbol possibleFunction (as mentioned in the comments to Jason\'s answer)To avoid this behaviour you can only pass the name of the function you want to check if it exists. SoThis sets a variable to be either the function you want to check or the empty object if it is not defined and so avoids the issues mentioned above. try Those methods to tell if a function is implemented also fail if variable is not defined so we are using something more powerful that supports receiving an string:Try this:try:If you look at the source of the library @Venkat Sudheer Reddy Aedama mentioned, underscorejs, you can see this:This is just my HINT, HINT answer :>I might doI know there\'s an accepted answer, but no one suggested this. I\'m not really sure if this fits the description of idiomatic, but it works for all cases.In newer js engines a finally can be used instead.I was looking for how to check if a jQuery function was defined and I didn\'t find it easily.Perhaps might need it ;)If you use http://underscorejs.org, you have:\nhttp://underscorejs.org/#isFunctionOne-line solution:
