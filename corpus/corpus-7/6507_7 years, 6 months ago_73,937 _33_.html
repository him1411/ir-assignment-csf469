Is there a way to tell if a file is being tracked by running some git command and checking its exit code?In other words: is git tracking a file?try:will exit with 1 if file is not trackedIf you don\'t want to clutter up your console with error messages, you can also runand then check the result. If git returns nothing, then the file is not tracked. If it\'s tracked, git will return the file path.This comes in handy if you want to combine it in a script, for example PowerShell:EDITIf you need to use git from bash there is --porcelain option to git status:--porcelainGive the output in a stable, easy-to-parse format for\n  scripts. Currently this is identical\n  to --short output, but is guaranteed\n  not to change in the future, making it\n  safe for scripts.Output looks like this:Or if you do only one file at a time:ORIGINALdo:You will see report stating which files were updated and which ones are untracked.You can see bla.sh is tracked and modified and newbla is not tracked:Try running git status on the file.  It will print an error if it\'s not tracked by gitI don\'t know of any git command that gives a "bad" exit code, but it seems like an easy way to do it would be to use a git command that gives no output for a file that isn\'t tracked, such as git-log or git-ls-files.  That way you don\'t really have to do any parsing, you can run it through another simple utility like grep to see if there was any output.For example,git-ls-files test_file.c | grep .will exit with a zero code if the file is tracked, but a exit code of one if the file is not tracked.I suggest a custom alias on you .gitconfig.  You have to way to do:1) With git command:2) Editing ~/.gitconfig and add this line on alias section:Once launched command (1) or saved file (2), on your workspace you can test it:Just my two cents:git ls-files | grep -x relative/pathwhere relative/path can be easily determined by pressing tab within an auto-completion shell. Add an additional | wc -l  to get a 1 or 0 output.using git log will give info about this. If the file is tracked in git the command shows some results(logs). Else it is empty.For example if the file is git tracked,If the file is not git tracked,
