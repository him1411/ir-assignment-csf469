What does data-toggle attributes do in Twitter Bootstrap? I couldn\'t find an answer in Bootstrap API.I have seen a similar question before as well, link.\nBut it didn\'t help me much.It is a HTML5 data attribute that automatically hooks up the element to the type of widget it is. Some Examples:Go through the JavaScript docs and search for data-toggle and you will see it used in the code examples. One working example:Any attribute that starts with data- is the prefix for custom attributes used for some specific purpose (that purpose depends on the application). It was added as a semantic remedy to people\'s heavy use of rel and other attributes for purposes other than their original intended purposes (rel was often used to hold data for things like advanced tooltips).In the case of Bootstrap, I\'m not familiar with its inner workings, but judging from the name, I\'d guess it\'s a hook to allow toggling of the visibility or perhaps a mode of the element it\'s attached to (such as the collapsable side bar on Octopress.org).html5doctor has a good article on the data- attribute. Cycle 2 is another example of extensive use of the data- attribute.For example, say you were creating a web application to list and display recipes. You might want your customers to be able to sort the list, display features of the recipes, and so on before they choose the recipe to open. In order to do this, you need to associate things like cooking time, primary ingredient, meal position, and so on right inside the list elements for the recipes. In order to get that information into the page, you could do many different things. You could add comments to each LI element, you could add rel attributes to the list items, you could place all the recipes in separate folders based on time, meal, and ingredient (i.e. ). The solution that most developers took was to use class attributes to store information about the current element. This has several advantages:But there are some major drawbacks to this method:All the other methods I suggested had these problems as well as others. But since it was the only way to quickly and easily include data, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we did.\nHTML5 Data Attributes to the RescueHTML5 added a new type of attribute to any element\xe2\x80\x94the custom data element (data-*). These are custom (denoted by the *) attributes that you can add to your HTML elements to define any type of data you want. They consist of two parts:Attribute Name\nThis is the name of the attribute. It must be at least one lowercase character and have the prefix data-. For example: data-main-ingredient, data-cooking-time, data-meal. This is the name of your data.Attribute Vaule\nLike any other HTML attribute, you include the data itself in quotes separated by an equal sign. This data can be any string that is valid on a web page. For example: data-main-ingredient="chocolate".You can then apply these data attributes to any HTML element you want. For example, you could define the information in the example list above:Once you have that information in your HTML, you will be able to access it with JavaScript and manipulate the page based on that data. From the Bootstrap Docs:It is a Bootstrap defined HTML5 data attribute. It binds a button to an event.The presence of this data-attribute tells Bootstrap to switch between visual or a logical states of another element on user interaction.It is used to show modals, tab content, tooltips and popover menus as well as setting a pressed-state for a toggle-button. It is used in multiple ways without a clear documentation.Here you can also find more examples for values that data-toggle can have assigned. Just visit the page and then CTRL+F to search for data-toggle.Bootstrap leverages HTML5 standards in order to access DOM element attributes easily within javascript.Forms a class of attributes, called custom data attributes, that allow proprietary information to be exchanged between the HTML and its DOM representation that may be used by scripts. All such custom data are available via the HTMLElement interface of the element the attribute is set on. The HTMLElement.dataset property gives access to them.ReferenceThe purpose of data-toggle in bootstrap is so you can use jQuery to find all tags of a certain type.  For example, you put data-toggle="popover" in all popover tags and then you can use a JQuery selector to find all those tags and run the popover() function to initialize them.  You could just as well put class="myPopover" on the tag and use the .myPopover selector to do the same thing.  The documentation is confusing, because it makes it appear that something special is going on with that attribute.Thisworks just fine.So many answers given but I could not get the to the point answer.
