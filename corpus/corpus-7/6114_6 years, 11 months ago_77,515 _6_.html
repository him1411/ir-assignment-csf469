I created a solution in Visual C# 2010 Express that contains two projects: one is the client, the other is the server. I would like to debug both at the same time, but I can only seem to run one of the projects during debugging.Is there a way to run both at once?Go to Solution properties -> Common properties -> Startup Project and select Multiple startup projects.Max has the best solution for when you always want to start both projects, but you can also right click a project and choose Debug > Start New Instance. This is an option when you only occasionally need to start the second project or when you need to delay the start of the second project (maybe the server needs to get up and running before the client tries to connect, or something).
