I\'m new to Git and Terminal.  How can I exit a listing mode generated by the git status command?I have to guess here, but git is probably running its output into your $PAGER program, likely less or more. In either case, typing q should get you out.that\'s a less command, actually. It uses the same commands as vi.Type \'q\' and it will do the job.Whenever you are at the terminal and have a similar predicament keep in mind also to try and type \'quit\', \'exit\' as well as the abort key combination \'Ctrl + C\'.for windows :Ctrl + q and c for exit the running situation .  first of all you need to setup line ending preferences in termnial Then you can use :qMy preferred combo is Gq, which prints all diffs and then exits.You can type h to show the help commands for interacting with less, which prints this to console:Before pressing exit commands(q, etc..) check current input language: if it isn\'t English commands may not work.If you are on the git bash try using exit;I tried using the q or ctrl + q but they did not worked on bash.Crt + c works for Windows! user1852392 exit did it for me.\nMy results after pressing return;
