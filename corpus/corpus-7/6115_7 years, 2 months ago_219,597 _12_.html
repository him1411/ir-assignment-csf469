I am using grep recursive to search files for a string, and all the matched files and the lines containing that string are print on the terminal. But is it possible to get the line numbers of those lines too??ex: presently what I get is /var/www/file.php: $options = "this.target", but what I am trying to get is /var/www/file.php: 1142 $options = "this.target";, well where 1142 would be the line number containing that string.Syntax I am using to grep recursively is sudo grep -r \'pattern\' \'/var/www/file.php\'One more question is, how do we get results for not equal to a pattern. Like all the files but not the ones having a certain string?Line numbers are printed with grep -n:To get only the line number (without the matching line), one may use cut:Lines not containing a pattern are printed with grep -v:If you want only the line number do this: Example:Search pattern and show 20 lines after and before patterngrep -nr "search string" directoryThis gives you the line with the line number.
