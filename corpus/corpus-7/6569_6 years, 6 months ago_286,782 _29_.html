Anyone can show me where I can change the default work space in Eclipse?If you mean "change workspace" go to File -> Switch WorkspaceI took this question to mean how can you change the Default workspace so that when Eclipse boots up the workspace you want is automatically loaded: Modify the linewhere "F:/Workspace/Java" should be your default workspace!If you are talking about changing the working directory for a java program that you launch from within eclipse, then there\'s a space for that in the run configuration. \nIf you go to Run menu and select "Run Configurations..." then select your run configuration, then on the "Arguments" tab for a Java Application there is a place for you to edit the "Working directory". This alters the current directory that will be used for launching the java program. See related question Default eclipse working directory if this is what you are meaning.Whatever Frank has suggested to change in config.ini is correct. In case, if that didn\'t help, you need to remove path from recent workspace as below.Remove the first path in RECENT_WORKSPACES.MAX_RECENT_WORKSPACES=5\nRECENT_WORKSPACES=/Users/wrokspace1\\n/Users/wrokspace2\\n/Users/wrokspace3\\n/Users/wrokspace4\nRECENT_WORKSPACES_PROTOCOL=3\nSHOW_WORKSPACE_SELECTION_DIALOG=false\neclipse.preferences.version=1File > Switch workspace > add the workspace you like > Eclipse will restart using the workspace you wanted.If you mean to change the directory in which the program execution will occur, go to "Run configurations" in the Run tab.Then select your project and go to the "Arguments" tab, you can change the directory there. By default it is the root directory of your project.Open a command prompt.\nChange to the eclipse home directory and type "eclipse -clean"\ne.g.\nC:/eclipse>eclipse -cleanThis will ask for the workspace selection. It will also force to set it as the default workspace.Then, go to eclipsehome-->configuration-->settings folder.open org.eclipse.ui.de.prefs in a notepad.set this property to true from false.SHOW_WORKSPACE_SELECTION_DIALOG=trueYou will be asked for a workspace selection everytime.In Eclipse, go to File -> Switch Workspace, choose or create a new workspace.If you want to change recent workspace manually in a configurationfile\norg.eclipse.ui.ide.prefs exists in open this file in an editor find  RECENT_WORKSPACES in line #2 and in this line you can see recent workspaces and can change or even remove them.If you want to create a new workspace - simply enter a new path in the textfield at the "select workspace" dialog. Eclipse will create a new workspace at that location and switch to it.On Ubuntu I went to and added this line at the bottomand changed workspace to the dir path from my home to where I put my workspace.I combined @Frank answer with @Ronan Quillevere\'s commentMy kepler eclipse went into not responding at boot (shortly after installing GAE support) which I traced to a corrupt workspace. I fixed this by closing kepler, renaming the workspace directory (in use) so kepler starts normally without a workspace, then used file >> switch workspace to generate new workspace. Then started populating that with my old projects that I still needed.
