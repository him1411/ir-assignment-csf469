I have an action bar with a menuitem. How can I hide/show that menu item?This is what I\'m trying to do:Get a MenuItem pointing to such item, call setVisible on it to adjust its visibility and then call invalidateOptionsMenu() on your activity so the ActionBar menu is adjusted accordingly.Update: A MenuItem is not a regular view that\'s part of your layout. Its something special, completely different. Your code returns null for item and that\'s causing the crash. What you need instead is to do:Here is the sequence :\nfirst call invalidateOptionsMenu() and then inside onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu) obtain a reference to the MenuItem (by calling menu.findItem()) and call setVisible() on itFound an addendum to this question:If you want to change the visibility of your menu items on the go you just need to set a member variable in your activity to remember that you want to hide the menu and call invalidateOptionsMenu() and hide the items in your overridden onCreateOptionsMenu(...) method.In my example I\'ve hidden all items.Yes. You can call this:Update:Make sure your code doesn\'t returns null for item or it may crash the application.didn\'t work for me. I had to explicitly use onPrepareOptionsMenu to set an item invisible.So use onCreateOptionsMenu to create the menu and onPrepareOptionsMenu to change visibility etc.I was looking for an answer with a little more context. Now that I have figured it out, I will add that answer.By default the share button will be hidden, as set by android:visible="false".main_menu.xmlBut the share button can optionally be shown based on some condition.MainActivity.javaP1r4nh4 answer works fine, I just simplified it using a boolean flag:You can simply set the visibility of the menu item to false in your onCreateOptionsMenu() after inflating the menu.This worked for me from both Activity and Fragmentset a value to a variable and call invalidateOptionsMenu();for examplehttps://stackoverflow.com/a/21215280/466363 - answered by Look Alterno and Sufian.ActivityCompat.invalidateOptionsMenu() doesn\'t callback\nonPrepareOptionsMenu(); it just update the menu directly.My someMethod() get called from several places, even before\nonCreateOptionsMenu(), so I must check mMenu != null.You can use toolbar.getMenu().clear(); to hide all the menu items at once If you did everything as in above answers, but a menu item is still visible, check that you reference to the unique resource.\nFor instance, in onCreateOptionsMenu or onPrepareOptionsMenuCtrl+Click R.id.menu_open and check that it exists only in one menu file. In case when this resource is already used anywhere and loaded in an activity, it will try to hide there.For those using the Appcompat library: \nIf your Activity subclasses ActionBarActivity, you can call supportInvalidateOptionsMenu()Seen here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/19649877/1562524I think a better approach would be to use a member variable for the menu, initialize it in onCreateOptionsMenu() and just use setVisible() afterwards, without invalidating the options menu.The best way to hide all items in a menu with just one command is to use "group" on your menu xml. Just add all menu items that will be in your overflow menu inside the same group.In this example we have two menu items that will always show (regular item and search) and three overflow items:Then, on your activity (preferable at onCreateOptionsMenu), use command setGroupVisible to set all menu items visibility to false or true.If you want to use this command anywhere else on your activity, be sure to save menu class to local, and always check if menu is null, because you can execute before createOptionsMenu:
