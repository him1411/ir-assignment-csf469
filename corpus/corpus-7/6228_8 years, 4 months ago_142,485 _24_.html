I\xe2\x80\x99m embedding Google Maps into my web site. Once Google Maps is loaded, I need to kick off a few JavaScript processes.Is there a way to auto-detect when Google Maps has fully loaded, including tile downloads and all?A tilesloaded() method exists that is supposed to accomplish exactly this task but it does not work.This was bothering me for a while with GMaps v3.I found a way to do it like this:The "idle" event is triggered when the map goes to idle state - everything loaded (or failed to load). I found it to be more reliable then tilesloaded/bounds_changed and using addListenerOnce method the code in the closure is executed the first time "idle" is fired and then the event is detached.I\'m creating html5 mobile apps and I noticed that the idle, bounds_changed and tilesloaded events fire when the map object is created and rendered (even if it is not visible).To make my map run code when it is shown for the first time I did the following:If you\'re using the Maps API v3, this has changed.In version 3, you essentially want to set up a listener for the bounds_changed event, which will trigger upon map load. Once that has triggered, remove the listener as you don\'t want to be informed every time the viewport bounds change.This may change in the future as the V3 API is evolving :-)If you\'re using web components, then they have this as an example:GMap2::tilesloaded() would be the event you\'re looking for.See GMap2.tilesloaded for references.Where the variable map is an object of type GMap2:If the map does not have a proper height and width, than only one tile will load and the map will appear gray and broken.Because it did load a tile, the tilesloaded event will proc, and it is useless.You can however check to see if there is more than one tile loaded. If you are familiar with jQuery then this query will get you the child node count in google maps api v3:var mapChunks = $(".gm-style>div:first-child>div:first-child>div:first-child>div:first-child>div:first-child")[0].childNodes.length;This is obviously not the intended design pattern, however a simple check for >1 tells me if I need to re-init the map or not prior to focusing on the marker.One downside is that animations like DROP marker may still be animating from a previous attempt to load the map. The API is not smart enough to wait until it has a large enough viewing area, or to simply present an error event, instead of essentially finishing its process in a broken state.This answer should be considered more of a "why it\'s broken" instead of a fix, but if you want to use my Kludge in your code, please do so with caution. I may remember to come back and update this with a more elegant solution later :)You could check the GMap2.isLoaded() method every n milliseconds to see if the map and all its tiles were loaded (window.setTimeout() or window.setInterval() are your friends).While this won\'t give you the exact event of the load completion, it should be good enough to trigger your Javascript.
