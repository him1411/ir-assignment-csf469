How could I do something like this:You need add href property and check indexOf instead of containswould do it. Alternatively, you could use a regexp:like so:You would use indexOf like this:Also notice the addition of href for the string otherwise you would do:The regex way:Or in a simple statement you could use: I use this to test whether the website is running locally or on a server:This checks whether the href contains either 192.168 or localhost AND is followed by :1337.As you can see, using regex has its advantages over the other solutions when the condition gets a bit trickier.document.URL should get you the URL and Try this, it\'s shorter and works exactly as window.location.href:also if you want to check the previous URL:window.location isn\'t a String, but it has a toString() method. So you can do it like this:or From the old Mozilla docs:Location objects have a toString\n  method returning the current URL. You\n  can also assign a string to\n  window.location. This means that you\n  can work with window.location as if it\n  were a string in most cases.\n  Sometimes, for example when you need\n  to call a String method on it, you\n  have to explicitly call toString.Try this:Try indexOfYou can also try search (for regular expressions)I like to create a boolean and then use that in a logical if.Easier it getsUse Window.location.href to take the url in javascript.  it\'s a\n  property that will tell you the current URL location of the browser.\n  Setting the property to something different will redirect the page.To Explain this better :- Suppose you have this script  \n      \n      \n        var query = document.location.href.substring(document.location.href.indexOf("?") +\n  1);\n        var text_input = query.split("&")[0].split("=")[1];\n        document.getElementById(\'response\').innerHTML=text_input;\n        And the url form is www.localhost.com/web_form_response.html?text_input=stack&over=flowThe body will be "stack"Put in your js file
