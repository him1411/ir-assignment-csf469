Is there a way via .NET/C# to find out the number of CPU cores?PS This is a straight code question, not a "Should I use multi-threading?" question! :-)There are several different pieces of information relating to processors that you could get: These can all be different; in the case of a machine with 2 dual-core hyper-threading-enabled processors, there are 2 physical processors, 4 cores, and 8 logical processors.The number of logical processors is available through the Environment class, but the other information is only available through WMI (and you may have to install some hotfixes or service packs to get it on some systems):Make sure to add a reference in your project to System.Management.dllPhysical Processors:Cores:Logical Processors:ORProcessors excluded from Windows:You can also use Windows API calls in setupapi.dll to discover processors that have been excluded from Windows (e.g. through boot settings) and aren\'t detectable using the above means. The code below gives the total number of logical processors (I haven\'t been able to figure out how to differentiate physical from logical processors) that exist, including those that have been excluded from Windows:[Documentation]Environment.ProcessorCount should give you the number of cores on the local machine.WMI queries are slow, so try to Select only the desired members instead of using Select *. The following query takes 3.4s:While this one takes 0.122s:It\'s rather interesting to see how .NET get this internally to say the least... It\'s as "simple" as below:One option would be to read the data from the registry.\nMSDN Article On The Topic: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.win32.registry.localmachine(v=vs.71).aspx)The processors, I believe can be located here, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System\\CentralProcessorI am reasonably sure the registry entry will be there on most systems.Though I would throw my $0.02 in.You can also get it with PInvoke on Kernel32.dllThe following code is coming more or less from SystemInfo.cs from System.Web source located here:The following program prints the logical and physical cores of a windows machine.I was looking for the same thing but I don\'t want to install any nuget or servicepack, so I found this solution, it is pretty simple and straight forward, \nusing this discussion, I thought it would be so easy to run that WMIC command and get that value, here is the C# code. You only need to use System.Management namespace (and couple more standard namespaces for process and so on).
