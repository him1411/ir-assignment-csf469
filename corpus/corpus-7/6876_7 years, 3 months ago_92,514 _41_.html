You can verify this by temporarily renaming $HOME/.rvm/usr/lib and seeing if "gem install pg" works.To solve the problem have rvm rebuild using the system OpenSSL libraries (you may need to manually remove libssl.* and libcrypto.* from the rvm/usr/lib dir):This finally solved the problem for me on Ubunto 12.04.This solved the problem for me on Ubuntu 12.04 after every suggestion here had failed.Try this You should install PG Database server in the first place to install clients.
