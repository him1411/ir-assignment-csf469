I am aware of using .gitignore file to exclude some files being added, but I have several config.php files in source tree and I need to exclude only one, located in the root while other keep under revision control. What I should write into .gitignore to make this happen?From the documentation:If the pattern does not contain a slash /, git treats it as a shell glob pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the location of the .gitignore file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree if not from a .gitignore file).A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example, "/*.c" matches "cat-file.c" but not "mozilla-sha1/sha1.c".So you should add the following line to your root .gitignore:Use /config.php.Older versions of git require you first define an ignore pattern and immediately (on the next line) define the exclusion. [tested on version 1.9.3 (Apple Git-50)]Later versions only require the following [tested on version 2.2.1]If the above solution does not work for you, try this:
