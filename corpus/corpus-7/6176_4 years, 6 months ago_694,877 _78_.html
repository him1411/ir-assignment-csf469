I\'ve created a site using the Zurb Foundation 3 grid. Each page has a large h1.CSSHTMLWhen I resize the browser to mobile size the large font doesn\'t adjust and causes the browser to include a horizontal scroll to accomodate for the large text.I\'ve noticed that on the Zurb Foundation 3 Typography example page, the headers adapt to the browser as it is compressed and expanded. Am I missing something really obvious? How do I achieve this?The font-size won\'t respond like this when resizing the browser window. Instead they respond to the browser zoom/type size settings, such as if you press ctrl and + together on the keyboard while in the browser.Media QueriesYou would have to look at using media queries to reduce the font-size at certain intervals where it starts breaking your design and creating scrollbars.For example, try adding this inside your CSS at the bottom, changing the 320px width for wherever your design starts breaking:Viewport percentage lengthsYou can also use viewport percentage lengths such as vw, vh, vmin and vmax. The official W3C document for this states:The viewport-percentage lengths are relative to the size of the initial containing block. When the height or width of the initial containing block is changed, they are scaled accordingly.Again, from the same W3C document each individual unit can be defined as below:vw unit - Equal to 1% of the width of the initial containing block.vh unit - Equal to 1% of the height of the initial containing block. vmin unit - Equal to the smaller of vw or vh. vmax unit - Equal to the larger of vw or vh. And they are used in exactly the same way as any other CSS value:Compatibility is relatively good as can be seen here. However, some versions of IE and Edge don\xe2\x80\x99t support vmax. Also, iOS 6 and 7 have an issue with the vh unit, which was fixed in iOS 8.You can use viewport value instead of ems, pxs or pts.1vw = 1% of viewport width1vh = 1% of viewport height1vmin = 1vw or 1vh, whichever is smaller1vmax = 1vw or 1vh, whichever is largerfrom Css-tricks:\nhttp://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/Use CSS media specifiers (that\'s what they [zurb] use) for responsive styling:If you don\'t mind to use a jQuery solution you can try TextFill pluginjQuery TextFill resizes text to fit into a container and makes font size as big as possible.https://github.com/jquery-textfill/jquery-textfillI\'ve been playing around with ways to overcome this issue, and believe I have found a solution:If you can write your app for IE9+ and all other modern browsers that support CSS calc(), rem units, and vmin units, you can use this to achieve scaleable text without Media Queries:Here is it in action: http://codepen.io/csuwldcat/pen/qOqVNOThere are several ways to achieve this Use media query but requires font sizes for several breakpoints Use dimensions in % or em. Just change the base font size everything will change. Unlike previous one you could just change the body font and not h1 everytime or let base font size to default of the device and rest all in em see kyleschaeffer.com/....CSS3 supports  new dimensions that are relative to view port. But this doesn\'t work in android 3.2vmax = Bigger of 3.2vw or 3.2vhsee css-tricks.com/.... and also look at caniuse.com/.... This is partly implemented in foundation 5.in _type.scss they have two set of header variable For medium up they generates sizes based on the first set of variables.And for default-i.e small screens they use second set of variables to generates css.you can use these variables and override in your custom scss file to set font sizes for respective screen sizesThere\'s another approach to responsive font sizes - using rem units.Later in media queries, you can adjust all fonts sizes by changing base font size:To make this work in IE7-8 you will have to add a fallback with px units:If you\'re developing with LESS, you can create a mixin that will do the math for you.Rem units support - http://caniuse.com/#feat=remResponsive font size can also be done with this javascript called FlowType: FlowType - Responsive web typography at its finest: font-size based on element width.Or this javascript called FitText:FitText - Makes font-sizes flexible. Use this plugin on your responsive design for ratio-based resizing of your headlines.If you are using a build tool then try Rucksack.Otherwise, you can use CSS Variables (Custom Properties) to easily control the min and max font sizes like so (demo):jQuery "FitText" is probably the best responsive header solution. Check it out at Github:\nhttps://github.com/davatron5000/FitText.js As with many frameworks, once you "go off the grid" and override the framework\'s default CSS, things will start to break left and right. Frameworks are inherently rigid. If you were to use Zurb\'s default H1 style along with their default grid classes, then the web page should display properly on mobile (i.e., responsive).However, it appears you want very large 6.2em headings, which means the text will have to shrink in order to fit inside a mobile display in portrait mode. Your best bet is to use a responsive text jQuery plugin such as FlowType and FitText. If you want something light-weight, then you can check out my Scalable Text jQuery plugin:http://thdoan.github.io/scalable-text/Sample usage:I am afraid about font size. You can change font-size using media query. But technically it will not work smoothly. For an example: if you use Your font size will be 3em both for 300px and 200px width. But you need lower font-size for 200px width to make perfect responsive. So, what will be the real solution? There is only one way. You have to create a png (with blank background) image containing your text. After that you can easily make your image responsive (ex: width:35%; height:28px). By this way your text will be fully responsive with all devices.You can make font size responsive if define it in vw (viewport width). However not all browser support it. Solution is to use JS to change base font size depending on browser width and set all font sizes in %. Here is article describing how to make responsive fontsizes: http://wpsalt.com/responsive-font-size-in-wordpress-theme/In actual original sass not scss you could use belowe mixins to automaticaly set paragraph and all hedings font-size. I like it because it much more compact. And quicker to type. Other than that it provides same functionality. Anyway if you still want to stic to new syntax - scss then feel free to convert my sass to scss here:\n [CONVERT SASS TO SCSS HERE] Below I give you four sass mixins. You will have to twik theirs settings to your needs.After you finish playing with settings just make a call on one mixin - which is: +config-and-run-font-generator(). See code below and comments for more info.I gues you could do it automaticaly for media query like it is done for heder tags but we all use diferent media query so it would not be apropriate for everyone. I use mobile first design aproach so this is how I would do that. Feel free to copy and use this code.COPY AND PASTE THOSE MIXINS TO YOUR FILEPRECONFIGUR ALL MIXINS TO YOUR NEEDS - PLAY WITH IT! :) AND THEN CALL IT ON THE TOP OF YOUR ACTUAL SASS CODE WITH:This would generate this output. You can customize parameters to generate different sets of results, however because we all use different media query some mixins you will have to edit manualy (style and media).GENERATED CSS: After much conclusions I ended up with this combinationHere is something that worked for me.  I only tested it on an iPhone.  Whether you have h1, h2, or p tags put this around your text:This renders a 22pt text on a desktop and it is still readable on the iPhone.
