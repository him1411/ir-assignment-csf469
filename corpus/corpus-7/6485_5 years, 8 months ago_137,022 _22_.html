I need to loop some values,For $first and $last, i need it to be of fixed length 5. So if the input is 1, i need to add zeros in front such that it becomes 00001. It loops till 99999 for example, but the length has to be 5.E.g.: 00002, 00042, 00212, 012312 and so forth.Any idea on how i can do that? In your specific case though it\'s probably easiest to use the -f flag to seq to get it to format the numbers as it outputs the list.  For example:will produce the following output:More generally, bash has printf as a built-in so you can pad output with zeroes as follows:You can use the -v flag to store the output in another variable:Notice that printf supports a slightly different format to seq so you need to use %05d instead of %05g.Easier still you can just douse printf with "%05d" e.g.If the end of sequence has maximal length of padding (for example, if you want 5 digits and command is "seq 1 10000"), than you can use "-w" flag for seq - it adds padding itself.produceVery simple using printfUse awk like this:OUTPUT:Update:As pure bash alternative you can do this to get same output:This way you can avoid using an external program seq which is NOT available on all the flavors of *nix.I pad output with more digits (zeros) than I need then use tail to only use the number of digits I am looking for. Notice that you have to use \'6\' in tail to get the last five digits :)If you want N digits, add 10^N and delete the first digit.Output:
