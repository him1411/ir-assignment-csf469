Even with the "scroll lock" option enabled for the Eclipse console, eventually it overfills and starts auto-scrolling on me. Is there some way of increasing the capacity of the console so that it stores more lines? I wasn\'t able to find the option. Under Window > Preferences, go to the Run/Debug > Console section, then you should see an option "Limit console output." You can uncheck this or change the number in the "Console buffer size (characters)" text box below.(This is in Galileo, Kepler, Juno, Luna, Neon, Mars and Helios CDT)Open the Windows > Preferences menu.Expand the Run/Debug > Console preferences.Set the Console buffer size (characters) to something much bigger. 1000000 is the upper limit (about 1MB of text). Or just uncheck the Limit console output.For CDT users / C/C++ build, also adjust the settingin Window > Preferencesunder C/C++ > Build > Console (!)(This time in number of lines.)This also affects the "CDT Global Build Console".On the MAC OS X 10.9.5 and Eclipse Luna Service Release 1 (4.4.1), its not found under the Window menu, but instead under: Eclipse > Preferences > Run/Debug > Console.To increase the console buffer size in eclipseGo to windows > Preferences > Run/Debug > Console and you can provideany number of characters between 1000 to 1000000.\nUnder Window > Preferences, go to the Run/Debug > Console section, then you should see an option "Limit console output." You can unchecked this or change the number in the "Console buffer size (characters)" text box below. Do Unchecked.This is for the Eclipse like Galileo, Kepler, Juno, Luna, Mars and Helios.Window > Preferences, go to the Run/Debug > Console section >> "Limit console output.>>Console buffer size(characters):"\n(This option can be seen in Eclipse Indigo ,but it limits buffer size at 1,000,000 )AlternativeIf your console is not empty, right click on the Console area > Preferences... > change the value for the Console buffer size (characters) (recommended) or uncheck the Limit console output (not recommended):\n
