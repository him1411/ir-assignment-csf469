Can we get popovers to be dismissable in the same way as modals, ie. make them close when user clicks somewhere outside of them?Unfortunately I can\'t just use real modal instead of popover, because modal means position:fixed and that would be no popover anymore. :(Update: A slightly more robust solution: http://jsfiddle.net/mattdlockyer/C5GBU/72/For buttons containing text only:For buttons containing icons use (this code has a bug in Bootstrap 3.3.6, see the fix below in this answer)For JS Generated Popovers Use \'[data-original-title]\' in place of \'[data-toggle="popover"]\'Caveat: The solution above allows multiple popovers to be open at once.One popover at a time please:Update: Bootstrap 3.0.x, see code or fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/mattdlockyer/C5GBU/2/This handles closing of popovers already open and not clicked on or their links have not been clicked.Update: Bootstrap 3.3.6, see fiddle Fixes issue where after closing, takes 2 clicks to re-openThis closes all popovers if you click anywhere except on a popoverMost simple, most fail safe version, works with any bootstrap version.Demo:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/guya/24mmM/Demo 2: Not dismissing when clicking inside the popover content\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/guya/fjZja/Demo 3: Multiple popovers:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/guya/6YCjW/Simply calling this line will dismiss all popovers:Dismiss all popovers when clicking outside with this code:The snippet above attach a click event on the body.\nWhen the user click on a popover, it\'ll behave as normal.\nWhen the user click on something that is not a popover it\'ll close all popovers.It\'ll also work with popovers that are initiated with Javascript, as opposed to some other examples that will not work. (see the demo)If you don\'t want to dismiss when clicking inside the popover content, use this code (see link to 2nd demo):This is basically not very complex, but there is some checking to do to avoid glitches.Demo (jsfiddle)With bootstrap 2.3.2 you can set the trigger to \'focus\' and it just works:I made a jsfiddle to show you how to do it:http://jsfiddle.net/3yHTH/The idea is to show the popover when you click the button and to hide the popover when you click outside the button.None of supposed high-voted solutions worked for me correctly.\nEach leads to a bug when after opening and closing (by clicking on other elements) the popover for the first time, it doesn\'t open again, until you make two clicks on the triggering link instead of one.So i modified it slightly:This has been asked before here. The same answer I gave then still applies:I had a similar need, and found this great little extension of the Twitter Bootstrap Popover by Lee Carmichael, called BootstrapX - clickover. He also has some usage examples here. Basically it will change the popover into an interactive component which will close when you click elsewhere on the page, or on a close button within the popover. This will also allow multiple popovers open at once and a bunch of other nice features.This is late to the party... but I thought I\'d share it.\nI love the popover but it has so little built-in functionality. I wrote a bootstrap extension .bubble() that is everything I\'d like popover to be. Four ways to dismiss. Click outside, toggle on the link, click the X, and hit escape.It positions automatically so it never goes off the page.https://github.com/Itumac/bootstrap-bubbleThis is  not a  gratuitous self promo...I\'ve grabbed other people\'s code so many times in my life, I wanted to offer my own efforts. Give it a whirl and see if it works for you.You can also use event bubbling to remove the popup from the DOM. It is a bit dirty, but works fine.In your html add the .popover-close class to the content inside the popover that should close the popover.According to http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers, Use the focus trigger to dismiss popovers on the next click that the user makes.It seems the \'hide\' method does not work if you create the popover with selector delegation, instead \'destroy\' must be used.I made it work like that:JSfiddle herethis solution gets rid of the pesky 2nd click when showing the popover for the second timetested with with Bootstrap v3.3.7simply add this attribute with the elementWe found out we had an issue with the solution from @mattdlockyer (thanks for the solution!). When using the selector property for the popover constructor like this......the proposed solution for BS3 won\'t work. Instead it creates a second popover instance local to its $(this). Here is our solution to prevent that:As mentioned the $(this).popover(\'hide\'); will create a second instance due to the delegated listener. The solution provided only hides popovers which are already instanciated.I hope I could save you guys some time.Modified accepted solution. What I\'ve experienced was that after some popovers were hidden, they would have to be clicked twice to show up again. Here\'s what I did to ensure that popover(\'hide\') wasn\'t being called on already hidden popovers.Bootstrap natively supports this:JS Bin DemoSpecific markup required for dismiss-on-next-clickFor proper cross-browser and cross-platform behavior, you must use the <a> tag, not the <button> tag, and you also must include the role="button" and tabindex attributes.demo: http://jsfiddle.net/nessajtr/yxpM5/1/}this is my solution for it.This approach ensures that you can close a popover by clicking anywhere on the page. If you click on another clickable entity, it hides all other popovers. The animation:false is required else you will get a jquery .remove error in your console.Ok this is my first attempt at actually answering something on stackoverflow so here goes nothing :PIt appears that it isn\'t quite clear that this functionality actually works out of the box on the latest bootstrap (well, if you\'re willing to compromise where the user can click. I\'m not sure if you have to put \'click hover\' per-se but on an iPad, click works as a toggle. The end result is, on a desktop you can hover or click (most users will hover). On a touch device, touching the element will bring it up, and touching it again will take it down. Of course, this is a slight compromise from your original requirement but at least your code is now cleaner :)$(".my-popover").popover({\n      trigger: \'click hover\'\n  });I came up with this:\nMy scenario included more popovers on the same page, and hiding them just made them invisible and because of that, clicking on items behind the popover was not possible.\nThe idea is to mark the specific popover-link as \'active\' and then you can simply \'toggle\' the active popover. Doing so will close the popover completely\n    $(\'.popover-link\').popover({ html : true, container: \'body\' })I just remove other active popovers before the new popover is shown (bootstrap 3):Taking Matt Lockyer\'s code, I\'ve done a simple reset so the dom doesn\'t get covered by the element on hide. Matt\'s code: http://mattlockyer.com/2013/04/08/close-a-twitter-bootstrap-popover-when-clicking-outside/Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/mrsmith/Wd2qS/Try this, this will hide by clicking outside.I was having issues with mattdlockyer\'s solution because I was setting up popover links dynamically using code like this:So I had to modify it like so. It fixed a lot of issues for me:Remember that destroy gets rid of the element, so the selector part is important on initializing the popovers.The answer from @guya works, unless you have something like a datepicker or timepicker in the popover. To fix that, this is what I have done.This is my the best performance solution. Cheers.The answer works very well, just to add a angular directive in case you are using angular like me:The html code:It should have been as simple as use data-trigger=\'click focus\', because according to bootstrap:How popover is triggered - click | hover | focus | manual. You may pass multiple triggers; separate them with a space. manual cannot be combined with any other trigger.However, use click and focus together doesn\'t work for me for unknown reason, instead I have to toggle it manually.tested with 3.3.6 and second click is ok
