Okay guys, I am writing a Django application and I just want an idea of what actually a csrf token is and how it protects the data. Is the post data not safe if you do not use csrf tokens?I know how to use csrf_token but I just need some information how it works.This is the world without CSRF tokens.Now for the better one with CSRF tokens:Result: You keep your 10000 monetary units. I suggest you donate some of that to Wikipedia.(Your mileage may vary.)Yes, the post data is safe. But the origin of that data is not. This way somebody can trick user with JS into logging in to your site, while browsing attacker\'s web page. In order to prevent that, django will send a random key both in cookie, and form data.\nThen, when users POSTs, it will check if two keys are identical. In case where user is tricked, 3rd party website cannot get your site\'s cookies, thus causing auth error.The site generates a unique token when it makes the form page.  This token is required to post/get data back to the server.Since the token is generated by your site and provided only when the page with the form is generated, some other site can\'t mimic your forms -- they won\'t have the token and therefore can\'t post to your site.The root of it all is to make sure that the requests are coming from the actual users of the site. A csrf token is generated for the forms and Must be tied to the user\'s sessions. It is used to send requests to the server, in which the token validates them. This is one way of protecting against csrf, another would be checking the referrer header.
