I have registered my listener to a $broadcast event using $on functionand I want to un-register this listener based on a particular business rule. But my problem is that once it is registered I am not able to un-register it. Is there any method in AngularJS to un-register a particular listener? A method like $on that un-register this event, may be $off. So that based on the business logic i can sayand this function stop being called when somebody broadcast "onViewUpdated" event.ThanksEDIT:\nI want to de-register the listener from another function. Not the function where i register it.You need to store the returned function and call it to unsubscribe from the event.This is found in the source code :) at least in 1.0.4. I\'ll just post the full code since it\'s shortAlso, see the docs.Looking at most of the replies, they seem overly complicated.  Angular has built in mechanisms to unregister.Use the deregistration function returned by $on :This code works for me:EDIT: The correct way to do this is in @LiviuT\'s answer!You can always extend Angular\'s scope to allow you to remove such listeners like so:And here\'s how it would work:And here\'s a plunker of it in actionAfter debugging the code, i created my own function just like "blesh"\'s answer. So this is what i didso by attaching my function to $rootscope now it is available to all my controllers.and in my code I am doingThanksEDIT: The AngularJS way to do this is in @LiviuT\'s answer! But if you want to de-register the listener in another scope and at the same time want to stay away from creating local variables to keep references of de-registeration function. This is a possible solution.@LiviuT\'s answer is awesome, but seems to leave lots of folks wondering how to re-access the handler\'s tear-down function from another $scope or function, if you want to destroy it from a place other than where it was created. @\xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbc \xd0\x9c\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd0\xb0\xd0\xb1\xd0\xb5\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2\'s answer works just great, but isn\'t very idiomatic. (And relies on what\'s supposed to be a private implementation detail, which could change any time.) And from there, it just gets more complicated...I think the easy answer here is to simply carry a reference to the tear-down function (offCallMeFn in his example) in the handler itself, and then call it based on some condition; perhaps an arg that you include on the event you $broadcast or $emit. Handlers can thus tear down themselves, whenever you want, wherever you want, carrying around the seeds of their own destruction. Like so:Two thoughts:\'$on\' itself returns function for unregisteryou can call  unregister() function to unregister that listener
