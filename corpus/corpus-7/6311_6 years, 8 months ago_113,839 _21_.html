I have an image view with some default height and width, images are stored in db and I want to scale Image according to Imageview height width. As I don\'t want it give default values because when ever I change it\'s height and width I also have to change it in code.I am trying to get the height and width of ImageView but 0 is returned to me in both cases.this returns me 0 even it has default height and widthMy answer on this question might help you:You can then add your image scaling work from within the onPreDraw() method.I just set this property and now Android OS is taking care of every thing.android:adjustViewBounds="true"Use this in your layout.xml where you have planted your ImageView :DI could get image width and height by its drawable;The reason the ImageView\'s dimentions are 0 is because when you are querying them, the view still haven\'t performed the layout and measure steps. You only told the view how it would "behave" in the layout, but it still didn\'t calculated where to put each view.How do you decide the size to give to the image view? Can\'t you simply use one of the scaling options natively implemented?Post to the UI thread works for me.I think you can let the Android OS take care of this for you.  Set the scale type on the ImageView to fitXY and the image it displays will be sized to fit the current size of the view.your xml file : your java file:If you have created multiple images dynamically than try this one:// initialize your images array// create programatically and add to parent view// That\'s it. Happy Coding.The simplest way is to get the width and height of an ImageView in onWindowFocusChanged method of the activity my friend by this u are not getting height of image stored in db.but you are getting view height.for getting height of image u have to create bitmap from db,s image.and than u can fetch height and width of imageview
