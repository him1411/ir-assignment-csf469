I\'m looking for a best way to implement common Windows keyboard shortcuts (for example Ctrl+F, Ctrl+N) in my Windows Forms application in C#.The application has a main form which hosts many child forms (one at a time). When a user hits Ctrl+F, I\'d like to show a custom search form. The search form would depend on the current open child form in the application.I was thinking of using something like this in the ChildForm_KeyDown event:But this doesn\'t work. The event doesn\'t even fire when you press a key. What is the solution?You probably forgot to set the form\'s KeyPreview property to True.

Then everything else is handled internally and all you have to do is to implement the appropriate action that gets executed in the Click event handler of that menu entry.You can even try this example:If you have a menu then changing ShortcutKeys property of the ToolStripMenuItem should do the trick.If not, you could create one and set its visible property to false.Hans\'s answer could be made a little easier for someone new to this, so here is my version.You do not need to fool with KeyPreview, leave it set to false. To use the code below, just paste it below your form1_load and run with F5 to see it work:From the main Form, you have to:Additionally,I have found this on google and I wanted to share this to those who are still searching for answers.
