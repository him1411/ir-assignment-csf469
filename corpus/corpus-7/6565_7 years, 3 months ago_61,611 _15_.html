I\'ve separated a project into two builds and given each of them a plist file. Everything works fine, but I keep getting this build warning:Warning: The Copy Bundle Resources build phase contains this target\'s\n  Info.plist file \'MyApp-Info.plist\'I get this when I try to build MyApp. Building for the second target gives the same error (with SecondTarget-Info.plist in the warning). I\'m not sure why it\'s a warning, since I want the build to contain that .plist file. Each of the .plist files have one target membership (for their own build).What does this warning mean? Is there any way to make it go away?https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1649/_index.htmlExcerpt:You are getting this warning because you probably added your Info.plist file to your Copy Bundle Resources build phase as shown in FigureThe INFOPLIST_FILE build setting specifies the name of the Info.plist associated with your target. When building a target, Xcode reads this build setting and copies the referenced Info.plist into your application bundle. Because Xcode automatically processes the Info.plist, you should not add it to your Copy Bundle Resources build phase or make it a target member.To resolve this warning, select your Info.plist from the Copy Bundle Resource build phase as shown in Figure 1, then click the Remove (\xe2\x80\x93) button to delete it from the phase.To fix in xcode 4:1) Remove the reference to your info.plist file by selecting it and hitting delete.2) Add the info.plist file again but choose no destination and uncheck the "add to targets" option.In case anyone runs into this with Xcode 3, to fix it click on the .plist file in the left column under "Groups and Files", and in the upper right area, uncheck the box next to the .plist file\'s name in the column under the bullseye icon.  You\'ll need the editor zoomed out (View -> Zoom Editor Out) to show the checkboxes.Just as a note... I\'m gonna try to write a nice Radar about it, but it\'s really weird the way Localization is handled in Storyboards in Xcode. If you ask "Show in Finder", you won\'t see your .storyboard file selected but instead its containing folder. I think it has to do with Localisation of the Storyboard. As soon as I changed that from English to German (and thus not having the file anymore in either root or en.lproj), I started to have trouble.
