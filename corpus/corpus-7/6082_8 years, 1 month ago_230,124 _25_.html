I have a file called tester.py, located on /project./project has a subdirectory called lib, with a file called BoxTime.py:I want to import BoxTime from tester. I have tried this:Which resulted:Any ideas how to import BoxTime from the subdirectory?EDITThe __init__.py was the problem, but don\'t forget to refer to BoxTime as lib.BoxTime, or use:Take a look at the Packages documentation (Section 6.4) here: http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.htmlIn short, you need to put a blank file named in the "lib" directory.In lib\\BoxTime.py, write a function foo() like this:In your client code in the directory above lib, write:Run your client code. You will get:Much later -- in linux, it would look like this:You can try inserting it in sys.path:Does your lib directory contain a __init__.py file?Python uses __init__.py to determine if a directory is a module.Try import .lib.BoxTime. For more information read about relative import in PEP 328.I do this which basically covers all cases (make sure you have __init__.py in relative/path/to/your/lib/folder):\nExample: \nYou have in your project folder: You have in another project folder: You want to use /root/anotherproject/utils.py and call foo function which is in it.So you write in app.py:try this:from lib import BoxTime
