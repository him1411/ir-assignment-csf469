I have a web application that\'s branded according to the user that\'s currently logged in. I\'d like to change the favicon of the page to be the logo of the private label, but I\'m unable to find any code or any examples of how to do this. Has anybody successfully done this before?I\'m picturing having a dozen icons in a folder, and the reference to which favicon.ico file to use is just generated dynamically along with the HTML page. Thoughts?Why not?Firefox should be cool with it.edited to properly overwrite existing iconsHere\xe2\x80\x99s some code that works in Firefox, Opera, and Chrome (unlike every other answer posted here). Still fails in Safari and Internet Explorer though.You would then use it as follows:Fork away or view a demo.If you have the following HTML snippet:You can change the favicon using Javascript by changing the HREF element on this link, for instance (assuming you\'re using JQuery):You can also create a Canvas element and set the HREF as a ToDataURL() of the canvas, much like the Favicon Defender does.jQuery Version:or even better:Vanilla JS version:Here\'s some code I use to add dynamic favicon support to Opera, Firefox and Chrome. I couldn\'t get IE or Safari working though. Basically Chrome allows dynamic favicons, but it only updates them when the page\'s location (or an iframe etc in it) changes as far as I can tell:To change favicons, just go favicon.change("ICON URL") using the above.(credits to http://softwareas.com/dynamic-favicons for the code I based this on.)A more modern approach:You can then use it like this:The favicon is declared in the head tag with something like:You should be able to just pass the name of the icon you want along in the view data and throw it into the head tag.I would use Greg\'s approach and make a custom handler for favicon.ico\nHere is a (simplified) handler that works:Then you can use that handler in the httpHandlers section of the web config in IIS6 or use the \'Handler Mappings\' feature in IIS7.The only way to make this work for IE is to set you web server to treat requests for *.ico to call your server side scripting language (PHP, .NET, etc).  Also setup *.ico to redirect to a single script and have this script deliver the correct favicon file.  I\'m sure there is still going to be some interesting issues with cache if you want to be able to bounce back and forth in the same browser between different favicons.According to WikiPedia, you can specify which favicon file to load using the link tag in the head section, with a parameter of rel="icon". For example:I imagine if you wanted to write some dynamic content for that call, you would have access to cookies so you could retrieve your session information that way and present appropriate content.You may fall foul of file formats (IE reportedly only supports it\'s .ICO format, whilst most everyone else supports PNG and GIF images) and possibly caching issues, both on the browser and through proxies. This would be because of the original itention of favicon, specifically, for marking a bookmark with a site\'s mini-logo.Yes totally possiblee.g. Then whatever server side language / framework you use should easily be able to find the file based on the userId and serve it up in response to that request.  But to do favicons properly (its actually a really complex subject) please see the answer here https://stackoverflow.com/a/45301651/661584 A lot lot easier than working out all the details yourself. Enjoy. You can do this: I did this and it worked just fine.
