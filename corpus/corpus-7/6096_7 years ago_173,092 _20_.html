I would like to make sure that the list is scrolled all the way to the bottom, after I have updated the listview by using listAdapter, so that it displays the last element entered in the list.  How can I do this ?I tried this but no luck:thank youSupposing you know when the list data has changed, you can manually tell the list to scroll to the bottom by setting the list selection to the last row.  Something like:You need to use these parameters in your list view:Scroll\nlv.setTranscriptMode(ListView.TRANSCRIPT_MODE_ALWAYS_SCROLL);Set the head of the list to it bottom\nlv.setStackFromBottom(true);You can also set these parameters in XML, eg. like this:In your xml layout, set the following parameters for the listview.Cheers!!!A combination of TRANSCRIPT_MODE_ALWAYS_SCROLL and setSelection made it work for meI\'ve had success using this in response to a button click, so I guess that you can use it too after updating your contents:Using :\nSet the head of the list to it bottom lv.setStackFromBottom(true);Worked for me and the list is scrolled to the bottom automatically when it is first brought into visibility. The list then scrolls as it should with TRANSCRIPT_MODE_ALWAYS_SCROLL.I use to add entries at the bottom, and older entries scroll off the top, like a chat transcriptTo get this in a ListFragment: Added this answer because if someone do a google search for same problem with ListFragment he just finds this..RegardsThe transcript mode is what you want and is used by Google Talk and the SMS/MMS application. Are you correctly calling notifyDatasetChanged() on your adapter when you add items?
