Alright, so I\'ve been doing some poking around, and I realize my problem, but I don\'t know how to fix it.  I have made a custom class to hold some data.  I make objects for this class, and I need to them to last between sessions.  Before I was putting all my information in NSUserDefaults, but this isn\'t working.That is the error message I get when I put my custom class, "Player", in the NSUserDefaults.  Now, I\'ve read up that apparently NSUserDefaults only stores some types of information.  So how an I get my objects into NSUSerDefaults?I read that there should be a way to to "encode" my custom object and then put it in, but I\'m not sure how to implement it, help would be appreciated!  Thank you!****EDIT****Alright, so I worked with the code given below (Thank you!), but I\'m still having some issues.  Basically, the code crashes now and I\'m not sure why, because it doesn\'t give any errors.  Perhaps I\'m missing something basic and I\'m just too tired, but we\'ll see.  Here is the implementation of my Custom class, "Player":Implementation File:So that\'s my class, pretty straight forward, I know it works in making my objects.  So here is the relevant parts of the AppDelegate file (where I call the encryption and decrypt functions):And then the important parts of the implementation file:Eeee, sorry about all the code.  Just trying to help.  Basically, the app will launch and then crash immediatly.  I\'ve narrowed it down to the encryption part of the app, that\'s where it crashes, so I\'m doing something wrong but I\'m not sure what.  Help would be appreciated again, thank you!(I haven\'t gotten around to decrypting yet, as I haven\'t gotten encrypting working yet.)On your Player class, implement the following two methods (substituting calls to encodeObject with something relevant to your own object):Reading and writing from NSUserDefaults:Code shamelessly borrowed from: saving class in nsuserdefaultsI create a library RMMapper (https://github.com/roomorama/RMMapper) to help save custom object into NSUserDefaults easier and more convenient, because implementing encodeWithCoder and initWithCoder is super boring!To mark a class as archivable, just use: #import "NSObject+RMArchivable.h"To save a custom object into NSUserDefaults:To get custom obj from NSUserDefaults:If anybody is looking for a swift version:1) Create a custom class for your data2) To save data use following function:3) To retrieve:Note: Here I am saving and retrieving an array of the custom class objects.Taking @chrissr\'s answer and running with it, this code can be implemented into a nice category on NSUserDefaults to save and retrieve custom objects:Usage:Synchronize the data/object that you have saved into NSUserDefaults Hope this will help you.
