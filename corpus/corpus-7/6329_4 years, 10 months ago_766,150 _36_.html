I can not initialize a List as in the following code:I face the following error:  Cannot instantiate the type List<String>How can I instantiate List<String>?If you check the API for List you\'ll notice it says:Being an interface means it cannot be instantiated (no new List() is possible).If you check that link, you\'ll find some classes that implement List:All Known Implementing Classes:AbstractList, AbstractSequentialList, ArrayList, AttributeList, CopyOnWriteArrayList, LinkedList, RoleList, RoleUnresolvedList, Stack, VectorThose can be instantiated. Use their links to know more about them, I.E: to know which fits better your needs.The 3 most commonly used ones probably are:Bonus:\nYou can also instantiate it with values, in an easier way, using the Arrays class, as follows:But note you are not allowed to add more elements to that list, as it\'s fixed-size.List is an Interface, you cannot instantiate an Interface, because interface is a convention, what methods should have your classes. In order to instantiate, you need some realizations(implementations) of that interface. Try the below code with very popular implementations of List interface:orYou will need to use ArrayList<String> or such.List<String> is an interface.Use this:  List is an interface, and you can not initialize an interface. Instantiate an implementing class instead.Like:List is just an interface, a definition of some generic list. You need to provide an implementation of this list interface. Two most common are:ArrayList - a list implemented over an arrayLinkedList - a list implemented like an interconnected chain of elementsIn most cases you want simple ArrayList - an implementation of ListBefore JDK version 7JDK 7 and later you can use the diamond operatorFurther informations are written here Oracle documentation - CollectionsDepending on what kind of List you want to use, something likeshould get you going.List is the interface, ArrayList is one implementation of the List interface. More implementations that may better suit your needs can be found by reading the JavaDocs of the List interface.List is an Interface . You cant use List to initialize it.These are the some of List impelemented classes,You could use any of this as per your requirement. These each classes have its own features.If you just want to create an immutable List<T> with only one object in you can use this API:List<String> oneObjectList = Collections.singletonList("theOnlyObject\xe2\x80\x9d);More info: docs
