I have an UIImageView called "theImageView", with UIImage in a single color (transparent background) just like the left black heart below. How can I change the tint color of this image programmatically in iOS 7 or above, as per the tint method used in the iOS 7+ Navigation Bar icons?Can this method also work in WatchKit for an Apple Watch app?iOS\nFor an iOS app, in Swift 3:Swift 2:Meanwhile, the modern Objective-C solution is:Watchkit\nIn WatchKit for Apple Watch apps, you can set the tint color for a template image.
