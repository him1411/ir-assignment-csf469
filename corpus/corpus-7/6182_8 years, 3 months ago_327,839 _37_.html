I typically do:What if I just want to include everything (including any hidden system files) in my_directory, but not the directory itself? I don\'t want:I want:should do the job in one line. It works well for hidden files as well. "*" doesn\'t expand hidden files by path name expansion at least in bash. Below is my experiment:Use the -C switch of tar: The -C my_directory tells tar to change the current directory to my_directory, and then . means "add the entire current directory" (including hidden files and sub-directories).Make sure you do -C my_directory before you do . or else you\'ll get the files in the current directory. You can also create archive as usual and extract it with:Have a look at --transform/--xform, it gives you the opportunity to massage the file name as the file is added to the archive:Transform expression is similar to that of sed, and we can use separators other than / (, in the above example).\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_52.htmlThis Answer should work in most situations. Notice however how the filenames are stored in the tar file as, for example, ./file1 rather than just file1. I found that this caused problems when using this method to manipulate tarballs used as package files in BuildRoot.One solution is to use some Bash globs to list all files except for .. like this:This is a trick I learnt from this answer.Now tar will return an error if there are no files matching ..?* or .[^.]* , but it will still work. If the error is a problem (you are checking for success in a script), this works:Though now we are messing with shell options, we might decide that it is neater to have * match hidden files:This might not work where your shell globs * in the current directory, so alternatively, use:With some conditions (archive only files, dirs and symlinks):The below unfortunately includes a parent directory ./ in the archive:You can move all the files out of that directory by using the --transform configuration option, but that doesn\'t get rid of the . directory itself. It becomes increasingly difficult to tame the command.You could use $(find ...) to add a file list to the command (like in magnus\' answer), but that potentially causes a "file list too long" error. The best way is to combine it with tar\'s -T option, like this:Basically what it does is list all files (-type f), links (-type l) and subdirectories (-type d) under your directory, make all filenames relative using -printf "%P\\n", and then pass that to the tar command (it takes filenames from STDIN using -T -). The -C option is needed so tar knows where the files with relative names are located. The --no-recursion flag is so that tar doesn\'t recurse into folders it is told to archive (causing duplicate files).If you need to do something special with filenames (filtering, following symlinks etc), the find command is pretty powerful, and you can test it by just removing the tar part of the above command:For example if you want to filter PDF files, add ! -name \'*.pdf\'The command uses printf (available in GNU find) which tells find to print its results with relative paths. However, if you don\'t have GNU find, this works to make the paths relative (removes parents with sed):I would propose the following Bash function (first argument is the path to the dir, second argument is the basename of resulting archive):You can run it in this way:and it will generate the archive my_archive.tar.gz within current directory. It works with hidden (.*) elements and with elements with spaces in their filename.Use pax.Pax is a deprecated package but does the job perfectly and in a simple fashion.If it\'s a Unix/Linux system, and you care about hidden files (which will be missed by *), you need to do:I don\'t know what hidden files look like under Windows.Assumes that you do not want to include any subdirectories or any files from any subdirectories. Safely handles filenames with spaces or other unusual characters. You can optionally add a -name \'*.sql\' or similar filter to the find command to limit the files included.This one worked for me and it\'s include all hidden files without putting all files in a root directory named "." like in tomoe\'s answer :Simplest way I found:cd my_dir && tar -czvf ../my_dir.tar.gz *If the folder is mytemp then if you apply the above it will zip and remove all the files in the folder but leave it aloneYou can give exclude patterns and also specify not to look into subfolders too
