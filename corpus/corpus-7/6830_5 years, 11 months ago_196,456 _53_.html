How do I change the key pair for my ec2 instance in AWS management console? I can stop the instance, I can create new key pair, but I don\'t see any link to modify the instance\'s key pair.Here is what I did, thanks to Eric Hammond\'s blog post:That\'s it.Once an instance has been started, there is no way to change the keypair associated with the instance at a meta data level, but you can change what ssh key you use to connect to the instance.There is a startup process on most AMIs that downloads the public ssh key and installs it in a .ssh/authorized_keys file so that you can ssh in as that user using the corresponding private ssh key.If you want to change what ssh key you use to access an instance, you will want to edit the authorized_keys file on the instance itself and convert to your new ssh public key.The authorized_keys file is under the .ssh subdirectory under the home directory of the user you are logging in as.  Depending on the AMI you are running, it might be in one of:After editing an authorized_keys file, always use a different terminal to confirm that you are able to ssh in to the instance before you disconnect from the session you are using to edit the file.  You don\'t want to make a mistake and lock yourself out of the instance entirely.While you\'re thinking about ssh keypairs on EC2, I recommend uploading your own personal ssh public key to EC2 instead of having Amazon generate the keypair for you.Here\'s an article I wrote about this:Uploading Personal ssh Keys to Amazon EC2\n  http://alestic.com/2010/10/ec2-ssh-keysThis would only apply to new instances you run.Run this command after you download your AWS pem. Then dump the output into authorized_keys.Or copy pem file to your AWS instance and execute following commandsand thenInstruction from AWS EC2 support:this will save the updated authorized_keys filenow try open a new SSH session to your instance using your new key paiWhen you\'ve confirmed you\'re able to SSH into the instance using the new key pair, u can vi .ssh/authorized_key and delete the old key.Answer to  Shaggie  remark:If you are unable to connect to the instance (e.g. key is corrupted) than use the AWS console to detach the volume (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html) and reattach it to  working instance, than change the key on the volume and reattach it back to the previous instance.I went through this approach, and after some time, was able to make it work.  The lack of actual commands made it tough, but I figured it out.  HOWEVER  - much easier approach was found and tested shortly after:  I noticed that when managed by Elastic Beanstalk, you can change your active EC2 key pair. Under Elastic Beanstalk > Configuration > Instances, choose the new key from the EC2 key pair drop-down.  You\'ll see this message asking if you\'re sure:EC2KeyName: Changes to option EC2KeyName settings will not take effect\n  immediately. Each of your existing EC2 instances will be replaced and\n  your new settings will take effect then.My instance was already terminated when I did this. It then started, terminated, and started again. Apparently "replacing" means terminating and creating a new instance.  If you\'ve modified your boot volume, create an AMI first, then specify that AMI in the same Elastic Beanstalk > Configuration > Instances form as the Custom AMI ID.  This also warns about replacing the EC2 instances.After you\'ve modified your EC2 key pair and Custom AMI ID, and after seeing warnings about both, click Save to continue.Remember that the IP address changes when the instance is re-created so you\'ll need to retrieve a new IP address from the EC2 console to use when connecting via SSH.Modifying the answer from "yegor256". As if below steps are followed it will save lot of time and there will be no need to stop the running instance.That is it. Enjoy :)In case you are using ElasticBeanstalk platform, you can change the keys by going:This will terminate current instance and creates new one with chosen keys/settings.I believe the simpliest aproach  is  to :This will work only if you have access to the instance you want to change/add the key in. \nYou can create a new key pair. Or if you already have the key pair, then you can paste the public key of the new pair in the authorized_keys file on your instance.vim .ssh/authorized_keysNow you can use the private key for that pair and log in.Hope this helps.Yegor256\'s answer worked for me, but I thought I would just add some comments to help out those who are not so good at mounting drives(like me!):Amazon gives you a choice of what you want to name the volume when you attach it. You have use a name in the range from /dev/sda - /dev/sdp\nThe newer versions of Ubuntu will then rename what you put in there to /dev/xvd(x) or something to that effect. So for me, I chose /dev/sdp as name the mount name in AWS, then I logged into the server, and discovered that Ubuntu had renamed my volume to /dev/xvdp1). I then had to mount the drive - for me I had to do it like this:After jumping through all those hoops I could access my files at /mnt/tmpI have tried below steps and it worked without stopping the instance. My requirement was - as I have changed my client machine, the old .pem file was not allowing me to log in to the ec2 instance. You will see your old keys in that file.ssh-keygen -f YOUR_PEM_FILE.pem -y\nIt will generate a key. Append the key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys opened in step#1. No need to delete the old key.From AWS console, create a new key pair. Store it in your new machine. Rename it to the old pem file - reason is old pem file is still associated with the ec2 instance in AWS. All done.I am able to log in to the AWS ec2 from my new client machine.The simplest solution is to copy the contents ofinto your AWS instance\'s authorized_keys atThis will allow you to ssh into the EC2 instance without specifying a pem file for the ssh command. You can remove all other keys once you\'ve tested connecting to it.If you need to create a new key to share it with someone else, you can do that with:which will create the private key.pem file, and you can get the public key of that with:Anyone who has public_key.pub will be able to connect with
