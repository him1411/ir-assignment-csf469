this is my error:What can I do?updated:the log:** make sure the development packages of libxml2 and libxslt are installed **Assuming you are running a Debian-based distributionIf you\'re installing for Python 3 on Debian-based distributions, you\'ll want to install python3-dev too.This worked for me:In case, you are using Ubuntu/Lubuntu 13.04 or Ubuntu 13.10 and having problem with "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lz", you may need also install zlib1g-dev package:Put it all together:No you are missing the Python header files. This mostly happens on Linux when you are using the system Python (there are reasons not to do that, but that\'s a different question).You probably need to install some package, and it\'s probably called python-dev or python-devel.orOr somesuch.I solved this issue by increasing my server ram.I was running only 512 MB and when I upgraded to 1 GB I had no problem.I also installed every package manually prior to this in an attempt to fix the problem, but I\'m not sure whether this is a necessary step.just install requirements:Now, you can install it with pip package management tool:I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and this solves the issue for meOn Windows  I had the same error on windows when trying to manually install in Python 3.4 after it had been installed on 3.3.  I finally was able to solve it by installing the wheel and running pip from the Python34 directory.1) download wheel from here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml2) cd Python34\\Scripts3) pip.exe C:\\Users\\Home\\Downloads\\lxml- ......... .whlInstalling a lxml binary would do the trick. Check thispymemcompat.h:10: fatal error: Python.h: \xe6\xb2\xa1\xe6\x9c\x89\xe9\x82\xa3\xe4\xb8\xaa\xe6\x96\x87\xe4\xbb\xb6\xe6\x88\x96\xe7\x9b\xae\xe5\xbd\x95Boy you should post your error log with LANG=C or people can\'t get the real cause from your log. The log above says: No such file or directory.That means you should install the develop package of Python. That\'s usually "python-dev" on Debian flavored distro, and "python-devel" on RHEL flavored distro.All the answers above assume the user has access to a privileged/root account to install the required libraries. To install it locally you will need to do the following steps. Only showed the overview since the steps can get a little involved depending on the dependencies that you might be missing 1.Download and Compile libxml2-2.9.1 & libxslt-1.1.28(versions might change)2.Configure each install path for both libxml and libxslt to be some local directory using configure. Ex. ./configure --prefix=/home_dir/dependencies/libxslt_path3.Run make then make install4.Download and compile lxml from sourceI know I am late to the show,But this will help if nothing else works outSetting TMPDIR will ensure that the build can run everything that it needs to run, and setting STATIC_DEPS will tell it to pull in its own libxml2 and \nlibxslt2, instead of using the old versions installed on the server.Using cygwin 64 with Windows 8. I have got...pip install lxml\n      (...) I have tried everything until I realized a new cygwin toolchain has messed up python logic. cygwin install a compiler called "realgcc" that is not a real gcc. SolutionInstall gcc. Ex:This works for me, 12.04, python2.7.6The only thing helped for me was and then try upgrading python setuptoolsthis should resolve.I was having this issue with a pip install of lxml. My CentOS instance was using python 2.6 which was throwing this error.To get around this I did the following to run with Python 2.7:I am using Ubuntu 12, and this works for me:If you have installed the libxml2 and libxslt, maybe you need to create a symbolic link between libxml2 and libxslt path to python2.6 include path. Also you can try to add INCLUDE environment argument.\nBecause the gcc command only search this path: -I/usr/include/python2.6.The below file worked for me on windows \nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.3.3#downloadsOn osx 10.10.5 and in a virtualenv, maybe you can resolve that problem like below:I work on a Windows machine. And here are some pointers for successful installation of lxml (with python 2.6 and later).Have the following installed:All are not available at a pip install.libxml2\'s windows binary is found here.libxslt is found here.After you are done with the above two,do : pip install lxml.Another workaround is using the stable releases from PyPI or the unofficial Windows binaries by Christoph Gohlke (found here).Using Windows 7 with Cygwin, I came across:I fixed it by installing mingw64-x86_64-libxslt
