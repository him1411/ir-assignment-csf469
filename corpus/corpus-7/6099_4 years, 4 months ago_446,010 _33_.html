After rendering the entire page based on several user contexts and having made several $http requests, I want the user to be able to switch contexts and re-render everything again (resending all $http requests, etc). If I just redirect the user somewhere else, things work properly:If I use $window.location.reload(), then some of the $http requests on auth.impersonate(username) that are waiting for a response get cancelled, so I can\'t use that. Also, the hack $location.path($location.path()) doesn\'t work either (nothing happens).Is there another way to re-render the page without manually issuing all requests again?For the record, to force angular to re-render the current page, you can use:According to AngularJS documentation:Causes $route service to reload the current route even if $location hasn\'t changed.As a result of that, ngView creates new scope, reinstantiates the controller.$route.reload() will reinitialise the controllers but not the services. If you want to reset the whole state of your application you can use:This is a standard DOM method which you can access injecting the $window service.If you want to be sure to reload the page from the server, for example when you are using Django or another web framework and you want a fresh server side render, pass true as a parameter to reload, as explained in the docs. Since that requires interaction with the server, it will be slower so do it only if necessaryThe above applies to Angular 1. I am not using Angular 2, looks like the services are different there, there is Router, Location, and the DOCUMENT. I did not test different behaviors thereFor reloading the page for a given route path :-Well maybe you forgot to add "$route" when declaring the dependencies of your Controller:If you are using angular ui-router this will be the best solution.Just to reload everything , use window.location.reload(); with angularjsCheck out working exampleHTMLangularJShttp://jsfiddle.net/HB7LU/22324/Easiest solution I figured was,add \'/\' to the route that want to be reloaded every time when coming back.eg:instead of the followinguse,If you want to refresh the controller while refreshing any services you are using, you can use this solution:i.e.This will refresh the controller and the HTML as well you can call it Refresh or Re-Render.I got this working code for removing cache and reloading the page  ViewControllerInjectors: $scope,$state,$stateParams,$templateCacheUse the following code without intimate reload notification to the user. It will render the page  I\'ve had a hard fight with this problem for months, and the only solution that worked for me is this:
