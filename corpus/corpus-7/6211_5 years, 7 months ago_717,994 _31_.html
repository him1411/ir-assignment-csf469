We can determine the length of an ArrayList<E> using its public method size(), likeSimilarly we can determine the length of an Array object using the length propertyWhereas the size() method of ArrayList is defined inside the ArrayList class, where is this length property of Array defined?Arrays are special objects in java, they have a simple attribute named length which is final.There is no "class definition" of an array (you can\'t find it in any .class file), they\'re a part of the language itself.The members of an array type are all of the following:The public method clone, which overrides the method of the same name in class Object and throws no checked exceptions. The return type of the clone method of an array type T[] is T[].A clone of a multidimensional array is shallow, which is to say that it creates only a single new array. Subarrays are shared.Resources:It\'s "special" basically, with its own bytecode instruction: arraylength. So this method:is compiled into bytecode like this:So it\'s not accessed as if it were a normal field. Indeed, if you try to get it as if it were a normal field, like this, it fails:So unfortunately, the JLS description of each array type having a public final field length is somewhat misleading :(It\'s defined in the Java language specification:The members of an array type are all of the following:Since there is a limitless number of array types (for every class there is a corresponding array type, and then there are multidimensional arrays), they cannot be implemented in a class file; the JVM has to do it on the fly.Even though this is not a direct answer to the question, it is an addition to the .length vs .size() argument. I was researching something related to this question so when I came across it I noticed that the definition(s) provided hereThe public final field length, which contains the number of components of the array.   is not "exactly" correct.The field length contains the number of available places to put a component, not the number of components present in the array. So it represents the total available memory allocated to that array, not how much of that memory is filled. Example:Output:However, the .size() property of the ArrayList does give the number of elements in the list:Output:it\'s public final field , which contains the number of components of the array (length may be positive or zero)An array thus has the same public fields and methods as the following class:more info at 10.7 Array Membershttp://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/arrays.doc.htmlThe keyword length acts like a data filed defined. When using in an array, we can use it to access how many elements in an array. Regarding to String[], we can invoke length() method defined in String class. With regard to ArrayList, we can use size() method defined in ArrayList. Note that when creating an array list with ArrayList<>(capacity), the initial size() of this array list is zero since there is no element.
