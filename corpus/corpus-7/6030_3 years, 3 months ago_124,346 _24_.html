How do I get a reference to the app delegate in Swift?Ultimately, I want to use the reference to access the managed object context.The other solution is correct in that it will get you a reference to the application\'s delegate, but this will not allow you to access any methods or variables added by your subclass of UIApplication, like your managed object context. To resolve this, simply downcast to "AppDelegate" or what ever your UIApplication subclass happens to be called. Like so:In Swift, easy to access in your VC\'sIt\'s pretty much the same as in Objective-CThis could be used for OS XHere is the Swift 2.0 version:And to access the managed object context:or, using guard:Add a constructor in AppDelegate Class at the end of codeHow to use reference in your class?Appart from what is told here, in my case I missed the import UIKit:Create a method in AppDelegate Class for exand call it some where else for ex1) Make sure you import UIKit2) let appDelegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate! as! AppDelegateIn my case, I was missing import UIKit on top of my NSManagedObject subclass.\nAfter importing it, I could remove that error as UIApplication is the part of UIKitHope it helps others !!!I use this in Swift 2.3.1.in AppDelegate class2.Call AppDelegate withIn Swift 3.0 you can get the appdelegate reference byHere\'s an extension for UIApplicationDelegate that avoids hardcoding the AppDelegate class name:In the XCode 6.2, this also works
