I have a lot of changes in a working folder, and something screwed up trying to do an update.Now when I issue an \'svn cleanup\' I get:MemPoolTests.cpp is a new file another developer added and was brought down in the update.  It did not exist in my working folder before.Is there anything I can do to try and move forward without having to checkout a fresh copy of the repository? Clarification: Thanks for the suggestions about moving the directory out of the way and bringing down a new copy.  I know that is an option, but it is one I\'d like to avoid since there are many changes nested several directories deep (this should have been a branch...)  What I\'m hoping for is a more aggressive way of doing the cleanup, maybe someway of forcing the file svn is having trouble with back into a known state (and I tried deleting the working copy of it ... that didn\'t help).When starting all over is not an option...I deleted the log file in the .svn directory (I also deleted the offending file in .svn/props-base)Then did a cleanup..Then resumed my update.Things have changed with SVN 1.7, and the popular solution of deleting the log file in the .svn directory isn\'t feasible with the move to a database working-copy implementation.Here\'s what I did that seemed to work:That\'s all a little confusing, process wise. Essentially, what we\'re doing is deleting the corrupt .svn then creating a new .svn for the same checkout path. We then move this new .svn to our old working directory and update it to the repo.I just did this in TSVN and it seems to work fine and not require a full checkout and download.-JodyTake a look athttp://www.anujvarma.com/svn-cleanup-failedprevious-operation-has-not-finished-run-cleanup-if-it-was-interrupted/ Summary of fix from above link (Thanks to Anuj Varma)\nInstall sqllite (32 bit binary for windows) from here.sqlite .svn/wc.db "select * from work_queue"The SELECT should show you your offending folder/file as part of the\n  work queue. What you need to do is delete this item from the work\n  queue.That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Now, you can run cleanup again \xe2\x80\x93 and it should work. Or you\n  can proceed directly to the task you were doing before being prompted\n  to run cleanup (adding a new file etc.)If all else fails:This answer only applies to versions before 1.7 (thanks @\xc5\x81ukaszBachman)subversion stores its information per folder (in .svn), so if you are just dealing with a subfolder you don\'t need checkout the whole repository - just the folder that has borked:this will give you a good working copy of the borked folder but you still have your changes backed up in borked_dir.bak . The same principle applies with windows/tortoiseif you have changes in an isolated folder have a look at theor Then Hope it helpsThe latest verion (I\'m using 1.9.5) solve this problem by adding an option of "Break locks" on the clean up menu. Just make sure this check box is selected when doing clean up.It\'s possible that you have problem with two filenames differing only by uppercase. If you ran into this problem, creating another working copy directory does not solve the problem.Current Windows (i.e. crappy) filesystems simply does not grok the difference between Filename and FILEname. You have two possible fixes:I had the exact same problem, I couldn\'t commit and cleanup would fail.Using a command line client I was able to see an error message indicating that it was failing to move a file from .svn/props to .svn/prop-baseI looked at the specific file and found that it was marked read-only. After removing the read-only attribute I was able to cleanup the folder and the commit my changes.Hope this helps.I just had this same problem on Windows 7 64-bit.  I ran console as administrator and deleted the .svn directory from the problem directory (got an error about logs or something, but ignored it).  Then, in explorer, I deleted the problem directory which was no longer showing as under version control.  Then, I ran an update and things proceeded as expected.I had the same problem, my the cause was a conflict with EasySvn and (TortoiseSvn or just Svn).  I had auto update and commit with easy svn (which wasn\'t working).  When I turned this off, I was unable to cleanup, commit, or update.  None of the above solutions worked, but rebooting did :)Whenever I have similar problems I use rsync (NB: I use Linux or MacOSX) to help out like so:That way you have a fresh checkout but with the same working files.\nFor me this always works like a charm.HTHI\'ve tried to do svn cleanup via console and got error likeSo I created this file manually (empty) and did svn cleanup again. This time it was done OK.I ran into that too lately. What did the trick for me was after selecting "Clean up", in the popup options dialog, check "Break Locks", and then "OK". It cleaned up successfully for me. Tried different solutions explained here, none worked. In my case, (SVN 1.9.3), running on Eclipse, Team > Update to head fails with error:svn: E155004: There are unfinished work items in \'/home/user/path/to/svn-folder\'; run \'svn cleanup\' first.Team > Cleanup fails with same error.Simple solution found for me: I ran cleanup in a command line:The command succeeded.\nThen Team > Update in Eclipse worked again.If the issue is case sensitivity (which can be a problem when checking out to a Mac, as well as windows) and you don\'t have the option of checking out onto a *nix system, the following should work.  Here\'s the process from the beginning:[checkout ensues\xe2\x80\xa6 then\xe2\x80\xa6]What\'s happening here is that svn is trying to check out two files with similar names that differ only by case - Header_3_noBookmark.gif and Header_3_nobookmark.gif.  Mac filesystems default to case insensitivity in a way that causes svn to choke in situations like this. So...However, running svn cleanup doesn\'t work, as we know.spacer.gif isn\'t the problem here\xe2\x80\xa6 it just can\'t move past the previous error to the next file.  So I deleted all of the files from the directory other than .svn, and removed the svn log.  This made cleanup work, so that I could check out and rename the offending file.Following this, I was able to go back to the root directory of the project, and run svn up to check out the rest of it.(Before you try moving folders and doing a new checkout)delete the folder the offending file(s) are in - yes, even the .svn folder, then \ndo an svn cleanup on the very top / parent folderSubclipse gets confused by Windows\' truly diabolical locking behaviour. Unlocker is your friend. This can find locked files and forcibly release the locks.I faced the same issue.\nAfter some searching on the internet found the below article.\nThen realized that I was logged as a user different from the user that I had used to setup svn under, a permission issue basically.When I face this issue on tortoisesvn (Windows).\nI go to cygwin and run the \'svn cleanup\' from there, it cleanup correctly for me. after which everything works from tortoisesvn.Read-only locking sometimes happens on network drives with windows. Try to disconnect and reconnect it again. Then cleanup and update.After going through most of the solutions that are cited here, I still was getting the error. The issue was case insensitive OSX. Checking out a directory that has two file with the same name but different capitalization causes an issue. For example ApproximationTest.java and Approximationtest.java should not be in the same directory. As soon as we get rid of one of the file, the issue goes away.I hit an issue where following an Update, svn showed a folder as being conflicted. Strangely, this was only visible through the command line - Tortoise thought it was all fine.svn cleanup, svn revert, svn update and svn resolve were all unsuccessful at fixing this.I eventually solved the problem as follows:Following that, everything was fine.Note I didn\'t have any local changes, so I don\'t know if you\'d be at risk if you did. I didn\'t use the delete / update method suggested by others - I got into this state by trying that on the my_dir/sub_dir/sub_sub_dir directory (which started with the same symptoms) - so I didn\'t want to risk making things worse again!Not quite on-topic, but maybe helpful if someone comes across this post as I did.It might not apply in all situations, but when I recently encountered this problem my "fix" was to upgrade the subversion package on my system.  I had been running 1.4.something, and when I upgraded to the latest (1.6.6 in my case) the checkout worked.(I did try re-downloading it, but a checkout to a clean directory always hung at the same spot.)No no no! If you are using svn 1.7 or higher, the cleanup command should do the job!\ni also made some experiments and found out that the solution (at least in eclipse) was executing the cleanup just for the folder specified in the error message and not the whole project!What i did was sudo chmod 777 -R . to be able to change the permissions. Without sudo, it wouldn\'t working, giving me the same error as running other commands.Now you can do svn update or whatever, without having to scrap your entire directory and recreating it. This is especially helpful, since your IDE or text editor may already have certain tabs open, or have syncing problems. You don\'t need to scrap and replace your working directory with this method.I solved this problem by copying some colleague .svn directory into mine and then updating my working copy, it was a nice, quick and clean solution. Answers here didn\'t help me, but before checking out the project again, I closed and opened Eclipse (Subversive is my SVN client) and the problem disappeared.There are some very good suggestions above but if you are having an issue with Tortoise SVN on windows (a good product but ...) always fallback to the command line and do a simple "svn cleanup" first.In many circumstances the Windows client will not run the cleanup command but cleanup works fine using thing svn command line utility.This just happened to me now so I felt compelled to post!While facing similar issue, Manual merge in repository sync view helped to solve the issue.\nOne file name was conflicting with other and it clearly mentioned the issue, renaming newer file to diff name resolved it.
