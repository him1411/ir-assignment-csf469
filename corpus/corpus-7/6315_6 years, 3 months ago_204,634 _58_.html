My application  has the following flow screens :Home->screen 1->screen 2->screen 3->screen 4->screen 5Now I have a common log out  button in each screens(Home/ screen 1 / screen 2 /screen 3/ screen 4 / screen 5) I want that when user clicks on the log out button(from any screen), all the screens will be finished and a new screen Log in will open . I have tried nearly all FLAG_ACTIVITY to achieve this.\nI also go through some answers in stackoverflow, but not being able to solve the problem.\nMy application is on Android 1.6 so not being able to use FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK Is there any way to solve the issue ?Use: This will clear all the activities on top of home. Assuming you are finishing the login screen when the user logs in and home is created and afterwards all the screens from 1 to 5 on top of that one. The code i posted will return you to home screen finishing all the other activites. You can add an extra in the intent and read that in the home screen activity and finish it also (maybe launch login screen again from there or something).I am not sure but you can also try going to login with this flag. I don\'t know how the activities will be ordered in that case. So don\'t know if it will clear the ones below the screen you are on including the one you are currently on but its definitely the way to go.Hope this helps. You may try Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK|Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK. It will totally clears all previous activity(s) and start new activity. Before launching your new Activity, simply add the following code:Or if you want it to work in previous versions of Android:When the user wishes to exit all open activities, they should press a button which loads the first Activity that runs when your application starts, clear all the other activities, then have the last remaining activity finish. Have the following code run when the user presses the exit button. In my case, LoginActivity is the first activity in my program to run.The above code clears all the activities except for LoginActivity. Then put the following code inside the LoginActivity\'s onCreate(...), to listen for when LoginActivity is recreated and the \'EXIT\' signal was passed:Why is making an exit button in Android so hard?Android tries hard to discourage you from having an "exit" button in your application, because they want the user to never care about whether or not the programs they use are running in the background or not. The Android OS developers want your program to be able to survive an unexpected shutdown and power off of the phone, and when the user restarts the program, they pick up right where they left off. So the user can receive a phone call while they use your application, and open maps which requires your application to be freed for more resources. When the user resumes your application, they pick up right where they left off with no interruption. This exit button is usurping power from the activity manager, potentially causing problems with the automatically managed android program life cycle.This Will work for all Android versions. Where IntentCompat the class added in Android Support library. Use the following for activityremove CLEAR_TASK flag for fragment use.I hope this may use for some people.From developer.android.com:Added in API level 16Finish this activity as well as all activities immediately below it in the current task that have the same affinity. This is typically used when an application can be launched on to another task (such as from an ACTION_VIEW of a content type it understands) and the user has used the up navigation to switch out of the current task and in to its own task. In this case, if the user has navigated down into any other activities of the second application, all of those should be removed from the original task as part of the task switch.Note that this finish does not allow you to deliver results to the previous activity, and an exception will be thrown if you are trying to do so.A solution I implemented for this (I think I found it on StackÂ Overflow somewhere, but I don\'t remember, so thanks to whoever did that in the first place):From any of your activities do this:Then in your LoginActivity, overwrite onKeyDown:For logout button on last screen of app, use this code on logout button listener to finish all open previous activities, and your problem is solved.    i have same problem\nyou can use IntentCompat , like this :this code work for me .Android api 17If your application has minimum sdk version 16 then you can use finishAffinity()Finish this activity as well as all activities immediately below it in the current task that have the same affinity.This is work for me In Top Payment screen remove all back-stack activits,http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#finishAffinity%28%29Log in->Home->screen 1->screen 2->screen 3->screen 4->screen 5on screen 4 (or any other) -> If you are using startActivityForResult() in your previous activities, just override OnActivityResult() and call the finish(); method inside it in all activities.. This will do the job...for API >= 15 to API 23\nsimple solution.When user click on the logout button then write the following code:And also when after login if you call new activity do not use finish();On a side note, good to know\nThis answer works (https://stackoverflow.com/a/13468685/7034327)whereas this doesn\'t work.setFlags() replaces any previous flags and doesn\'t append any new flags while .addFlags() does.So this will also workIf you log in the user in screen 1 and from there you go to the other screens, use Simply, when you go from the login screen, not when finishing the login screen.And then in all forward activities, use this for logout:It works perfectly.I found this way, it\'ll clear all history and exitI found this solution to work on every device despite API level (even for < 11)for all API versionsfor above API 11
