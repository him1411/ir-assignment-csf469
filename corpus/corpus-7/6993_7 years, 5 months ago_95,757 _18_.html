This question already has an answer here:Do you know of any "JSON Beautifier" for JavaScript?FromToExampleThe JSON.stringify method supported by many modern browsers (including IE8) can output a beautified JSON string:This method is also included with json2.js, for supporting older browsers.  If you don\'t need to do it programmatically, Try JSON Lint.  Not only will it prettify your JSON, it will validate it at the same time.Here\'s something that might be interesting for developers hacking (minified or obfuscated) JavaScript more frequently.You can build your own CLI JavaScript beautifier in under 5 mins and have it handy on the command-line. You\'ll need Mozilla Rhino, JavaScript file of some of the JS beautifiers available online, small hack and a script file to wrap it all up.I wrote an article explaining the procedure: Command-line JavaScript beautifier implemented in JavaScript.Well, if you paste the JSON into JSONlint you get formatted output.Just paste it into: http://www.jsonlint.com/Validation and beautification :)If you just want beautification, this works on JSON as well as any javascript code:  http://jsbeautifier.org/jsbeautifier.orgResult:If the correct Mime Type is used, FireBug shows JSON responses formatted and beautified.
