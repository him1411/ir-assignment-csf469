I read The Programming Language Swift by Apple in iBooks, but cannot figure out how to make an http request (something like CURL) in Swift. Do I need to import Obj-C classes or do I just need to import default libraries? Or is it not possible to make an HTTP request based on native swift code?Another option is the Alamofire lib that offers Chainable Request / Response methods.https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireMaking a RequestResponse HandlingYou can use URL, URLRequest and URLSession or NSURLConnection as you\'d normally do in Objective-C. Note that for iOS 7.0 and later, URLSession is preferred.Initialize a URL object and a URLSessionDataTask from URLSession. Then run the task with resume().First, initialize a URL and a URLRequest:Then, you can load the request asynchronously with:Or you can initialize an NSURLConnection:Just make sure to set your delegate to something other than nil and use the delegate methods to work with the response and data received. For more detail, check the documentation for the NSURLConnectionDataDelegate protocolIf you want to try this code on a Xcode playground, add import XCPlayground to your playground, as well as the following call:This will allow you to use asynchronous code in playgrounds.Check Below Codes :1.

This approach uses Notifiers and is spread over two classes. The example is to check the username and password for an identifier token using the website http://www.example.com/handler.php?do=CheckUserJson&json= That is the file is called handler.php and has a switch statement on the do parameter to get a RESTful approach.In the viewDidLoad we setup the NotifierObserver, set up the json and make the call to the getHTTPRequest function. It will return to the function checkedUsernameAndPassword with the returned parameter from the http request.There are two static functions in Utility.swift first to encode the json and then to do the HTTP call.and the Http requestThe sendNotification function completes the circle. Notice that in teh Observer there is a ":" at the end of the selector string. This allows the notification to carry a payload in userInfo. I give this  a String and an Int.Note that using HTTP is oldFashioned, prefer HTTPS see How do I load an HTTP URL with App Transport Security enabled in iOS 9?it will help you surely//Here is an example that worked for me //Swift function that post a request to a server with key values PHP Code to get the key values $empID = $_POST[\'id\'];$inOut = $_POST[\'inout\'];$comment = $_POST[\'comment\'];
