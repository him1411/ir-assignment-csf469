After connecting to the database, can I get the name of all the columns that were returned in my SqlDataReader?or There is a GetName function on the SqlDataReader which accepts the column index and returns the name of the column.Conversely, there is a GetOrdinal which takes in a column name and returns the column index.You can get the column names from a DataReader.Here is the important part:Already mentioned. Just a LINQ answer:The second one is cleaner and much faster. Even if you cache GetSchemaTable in the first approach, the querying is going to be very slow.If you want the column names only, you can do:But if you only need one row, I like my AdoHelper addition. This addition is great if you have a single line query and you don\'t want to deal with data table in you code. It\'s returning a case insensitive dictionary of column names and values.You sure can.
