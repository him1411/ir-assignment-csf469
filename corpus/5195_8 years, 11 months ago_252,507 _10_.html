MySQL 5.0.45What is the syntax to alter a table to allow a column to be null, alternately what\'s wrong with this:I interpreted the manual as  just run the above and it would recreate the column, this time allowing null. The server is telling me I have syntactical errors. I just don\'t see them.You want the following:Columns are nullable by default.  As long as the column is not declared UNIQUE or NOT NULL, there shouldn\'t be any problems.Your syntax error is caused by a missing "table" in the queryMy solution:For example:Under some circumstances (if you get "ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax;...") you need to doUse:\nALTER TABLE mytable MODIFY mycolumn VARCHAR(255);
