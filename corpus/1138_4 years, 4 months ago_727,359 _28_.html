I want to delete using INNER JOIN in SQL Server 2008.But I get this error,Msg 156, Level 15, State 1, Line 15\n  ncorrect syntax near the keyword \'INNER\'.My code:You need to specify what table you are deleting from, here is a version with an alias:Just add the name of the table between DELETE and FROM from where you want to delete records because we have to specify the table to delete. Also remove ORDER BY clause because there is nothing to order while deleting records.So your final query should be like this:Try this:Possible this be helpful for you -Or try this -It should be:Try this query :This version should worksIn SQL Server Management Studio I can easily create a SELECT query.I can execute it, and all my contacts are shown.Now change the SELECT to a DELETE:All the records you saw in the SELECT statement will be removed.You may even create a more difficult inner join with he same procedure, for example:Here is my SQL Server versionYou don\'t specify the tables for Company and Date, you might want to fix that.Standard SQL using MERGE:The answer from @Devart is also Standard SQL though incomplete, should look more like this:The important thing to note about the above is it is clear the delete is targeting a single table, as enforced in the second example by requiring a scalar subquery.For me the various proprietary syntax answers are harder to read and understand. I guess the mindset for is best described in the answer by @frans eilering i.e. the person writing the code doesn\'t necessarily care about the person who will read and maintain the code.Another way using CTE. Note : We cannot use JOIN inside CTE when you want to delete. Here\'s what I currently use for deleting or even, updating:This is a simple query to delete the records from two table at a time.
