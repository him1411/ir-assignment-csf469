I have a requirement where I need to download a PDF from the website. The PDF needs to be generated within the code, which I thought would be a combination of freemarker and a PDF generation framework like iText. Any better way? However, my main problem is how do I allow the user to download a file through a Spring Controller?Generally speaking, when you have response.getOutputStream(), you can write anything there. You can pass this output stream as a place to put generated PDF to your generator. Also, if you know what file type you are sending, you can set I was able to stream line this by using the built in support in Spring with it\'s ResourceHttpMessageConverter.  This will set the content-length and content-type if it can determine the mime-typeYou should be able to write the file on the response directly. Something like and then write the file as a binary stream on response.getOutputStream(). Remember to do response.flush() at the end and that should do it.With Spring 3.0 you can use the HttpEntity return object. If you use this, then your controller does not need a HttpServletResponse object, and therefore it is easier to test. \nExcept this, this answer is relative equals to the one of Infeligo.If the return value of your pdf framework is an byte array (read the second part of my answer for other return values) :If the return type of your PDF Framework (documentBbody) is not already a byte array (and also no ByteArrayInputStream) then it would been wise NOT to make it a byte array first. Instead it is better to use:example with FileSystemResource:If you:The code below is what you need:Also notice that to avoid reading the whole file just to calculate its length, you\'d better have it stored previously. Make sure you check the docs for InputStreamResource.This code is working fine to download a file automatically from spring controller on clicking a link on jsp.     What I can quickly think of is, generate the pdf and store it in webapp/downloads/< RANDOM-FILENAME>.pdf from the code and send a forward to this file using HttpServletRequestor if you can configure your view resolver something like, then just return Below code worked for me to generate and download a text file.something like belowYou can display PDF or download it examples here
