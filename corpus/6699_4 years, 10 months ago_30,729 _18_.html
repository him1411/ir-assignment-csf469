I use quite a lot third party libraries which have many warnings in it, after the latest Xcode updates. (for example the Facebook SDK pod)\nNow all these warnings are shown in my Xcode on the place I want to see my own warnings or errors. Is there any way to ignore these errors? Fixing them won\'t help, since after every "pod install" the changes are discarded.Add to your Podfile:Then execute: pod installYou can search for "inhibit_all_warnings" in xcode build settings of the PodBundle in your project-work space the set the value to "YES" it will hide all you Pod file warnings.If you do it to your work space it will hide all your project also.Although https://stackoverflow.com/a/13209057/9913 will remove warnings during the build phase, it doesn\'t appear to completely fix the Analyze phase (which caused our CI build to still have issues). What worked for me (in addition to the accepted answer) was:Add a new Other C Flags with the value -w -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer core (or whichever analyzers you need disabled) - this answer provides the full list of flags to try -- please upvote it!The version of clang in Xcode 6.3.1, though, doesn\'t seem to include insecureAPI so you can remove it from that list. The "current" full list is -w -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer alpha -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer core -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer cplusplus -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer deadcode -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer debug -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer llvm -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer osx -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer security -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer unixNote that setting this on the Pods Project or Pods Target will not work. I\'m not sure why, but you have to set it for each actual Pod- target.You can also set the compiler flags (-w -Xanalyzer -analyzer-disable-checker -Xanalyzer core etc.) on a per-file basis.I also tried a couple other methods (which may or may not be required in addition to the above). They were performed on the Pods Project itself.[1][2]For some reason, even disabling the Analyze step in the scheme doesn\'t seem to work. Go to the Product > Scheme > Manage Schemes window, click on each Pod-* from the list and click the Edit button. Click Build on the left-hand list, and then uncheck Analyze on the right-hand side for the Pod target.I am still confused as to why I can\'t completely disable the Pods from being analyzed, although I expect it might have to do with the "Find implicit dependencies" checked in the scheme\'s build settings. If that was unchecked, though, it looks like something else would need to happen for the app to link to the pods.
