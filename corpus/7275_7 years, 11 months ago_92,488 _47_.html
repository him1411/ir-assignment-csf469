Is there a gem to perform background and foreground text colorization for output in terminal?I remember, when programming Pascal we all used to play with textcolor(...) procedures to make our small educational programs look more pretty and presentational.Is there anything similar in Ruby?Colorize is my favorite gem!   :-)Check it out:https://github.com/fazibear/colorizeInstallation:Usage:Combining the answers above, you can implement something that works like the gem colorize without needing another dependency.As String class methods (unix only):and usage:on my console:removes formatting charactersYou can use ANSI escape sequences to do this on the console. I know this works on Linux and OSX, I\'m not sure if the Windows console (cmd) supports ANSI.I did it in Java, but the ideas are the same.I wrote a little method to test out the basic color modes, based on answers by Erik Skoglund and others.example output:\nWhile the other answers will do the job fine for most people, the "correct" Unix way of doing this should be mentioned. Since all types of text terminals do not support these sequences, you can query the terminfo database, an abstraction over the capabilites of various text terminals.  This might seem mostly of historical interest – software terminals in use today generally support the ANSI sequences – but it does have (at least) one practical effect: it is sometimes useful to be able to set the environment variable TERM to dumb to avoid all such styling, for example when saving the output to a text file.  Also, it feels good to do things right. :-) You can use the ruby-terminfo gem. It needs some C compiling to install; I was able to install it under my Ubuntu 14.10 system with:Then you can query the database like this (see the terminfo man page for a list of what codes are available):Here\'s a little wrapper class I put together to make things a little more simple to use.Usage:(edit) Finally, if you\'d rather not require a gem, you can rely on the tput program, as described here – Ruby example:I found a few:http://github.com/ssoroka/ansi/tree/masterExamples:http://flori.github.com/term-ansicolor/Examples:http://github.com/sickill/rainbowExample:If you are on Windows you may need to do a "gem install win32console" to enable support for colors.Also the article Colorizing console Ruby-script output is useful if you need to create your own gem. It explains how to add ANSI coloring to strings. You can use this knowledge to wrap it in some class that extends string or something.Here\'s what I did to make it work without needing any gems:Then only the text in the quotes there is colored, and you\'re returned to your regularly scheduled program.This may help you:  Colorized ruby outputI made this method that could help. It is not a big deal but it works:Here\'s how to use it:Possible improvements could be:This method does not work for p, as p does an inspect to its argument. For example:will show "\\e[0;38mHello World\\e[0m"I tested it with puts, print, and the Logger gem, and it works fine.I improved this and made a class so colors and bgColors are class variables and colorize is a class method:You can use it by doing:I found the answers above to be useful however didn\'t fit the bill if I wanted to colorize something like log output without using any third party libraries. The following solved the issue for me:I hope it helps!
