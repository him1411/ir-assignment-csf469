Rather than try to remove scrollbars (which we all know is not possible) we can avoid scrolling (perfectly feasible) and scroll within the elements that we make and have more control over.Create a div with overflow hidden.

These can also be set locally in the user style sheet for each application.  In IE you find it under the "Accessibility" tab, in Konqueror under the "Stylesheets" tab.As of IE8 these properties were vendor prefixed by Microsoft but were still never approved by W3C.IE makes scroll available which sets whether or not to disable or enable scroll bars; it can also be used to get the value of the position of the scroll bars.With Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and later, when you use the !DOCTYPE declaration to specify standards-compliant mode, this attribute applies to the HTML element. When standards-compliant mode is not specified, as with earlier versions of IE, this attribute applies to the BODY element, NOT the HTML element.It\'s also worth noting that when working with .NET the ScrollBar class in System.Windows.Controls.Primitives in the Presentation framework is responsible for rendering the scrollbars.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms534393(v=vs.85).aspxWebkit extensions related to scroll-bar customization are:These can each be combined with additional pseudo-selectors:Examples of these combinationsaddWindowScrollHandler\n  public static HandlerRegistration addWindowScrollHandler(Window.ScrollHandler handler)    Adds a Window.ScrollEvent handler\n  Parameters:\n    handler - the handler\n  Returns:\n    returns the handler registration\n  [source](http://www.gwtproject.org/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/user/client/Window.html#addWindowScrollHandler(com.google.gwt.user.client.Window.ScrollHandler)\n  )Mozilla does have some extensions for manipulating the scroll-bars but they are all recommended not to be used.-moz-hidden-unscrollable Only works internally within a users profile settings.

Auto is the default value.  Changing it to manual means that you as the developer will take ownership of any scroll changes that may be required when a user traverses the app\'s history. If you need to, you can keep track of the scroll position as you push history entries with history.pushState().You can accomplish this with a wrapper div that has it\'s overflow hidden, and the inner div set to auto.To remove the inner div\'s scroll bar, you can pull it out of the outer div\'s viewport by applying a negative margin to the inner div. Then apply equal padding to the inner div so that the content stays in view.JSFiddleYou can use the CSS property overflow and -ms-overflow-style with a combination with ::-webkit-scrollbar.Tested on IE10+, Firefox, Safari and Chrome and works good:This is a much better solution than the others when you hide the scrollbar with padding-right, because the default scrollbar width is different on each browser.
