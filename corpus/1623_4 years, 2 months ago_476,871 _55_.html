I\'m running Docker under Vagrant under OS X 10.8.4  (Mountain Lion), and whenever I try to delete a saved image, I get an error:According to the rmi help, the proper syntax is docker rmi IMAGE [IMAGE...], and I\'m not sure what to make of that.How can I delete an image?\xc2\xa0Interestingly, when I run docker ps, no containers show up at all. Running docker images shows four (4) base images and one (1) node image.Try docker rmi node. That should work. Seeing all created containers is as simple as docker ps -a. To remove all existing containers (not images!) run docker rm $(docker ps -aq)The following are some of the ways to remove docker images/containers:Note: Replace kill with stop for graceful shutdownUse grep to remove all except my-image and ubuntuOr (without awk)docker rmi $(docker images --quiet | grep -v $(docker images --quiet ubuntu:my-image))To remove an image from docker using the Image IdGet the list of all ImagesIdentify the image id of the image you want to delete, for example:Finally remove Image using image id (only the first three digits are required)Update, as commented by VonC in How to remove old Docker containersWith docker 1.13 (Q4 2016), you now have:docker system prune will delete ALL unused data (i.e. In order: containers stopped, volumes without containers and images with no containers).See PR 26108 and commit 86de7c0, which are introducing a few new commands to help facilitate visualizing how much space the docker daemon data is taking on disk and allowing for easily cleaning up "unneeded" excess.docker rm container_namedocker rmi image_namedocker helprm        Remove one or more containersrmi       Remove one or more imagesTo remove specific container For single imageFor multiple imagesRemove exited containersRemove all the containersRemove specific imagesfor single imagefor multiple imagesRemove dangling images \nDangling images are layers that have no relationship to any tagged images as the Docker images are constituted of multiple images.

I use this on production since we deploy several times a day on multiple servers, and i don\'t want to go to every server to clean up ( that would be a pain).Just run:It will run every 30min (or however long you set it using DELAY_TIME=1800 option) and clean up exited containers and images.More details: https://github.com/meltwater/docker-cleanup/blob/master/README.mdFirst of all, we have to stop and remove the docker-containers which are attached with the docker-image that we are going to remove.So for that, firstthen,For me the following worked fine:Then go ahead and remove an image by running some like these:
