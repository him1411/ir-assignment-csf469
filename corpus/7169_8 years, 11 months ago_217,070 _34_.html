How can I delete the contents of a local folder in Python?The current project is for Windows but I would like to see *nix also.Updated to only delete files and to used the os.path.join() method suggested in the comments. If you also want to remove subdirectories, uncomment the elif statement.Try the shutil moduleDescription: shutil.rmtree(path, ignore_errors=False, onerror=None)Docstring: Recursively delete a\n  directory tree.If ignore_errors is set, errors are\n  ignored; otherwise, if onerror is set,\n  it is called to handle the error with\n  arguments (func, path, exc_info) where\n  func is os.listdir, os.remove, or\n  os.rmdir; path is the argument to that\n  function that caused it to fail; and\n  exc_info is a tuple returned by\n  sys.exc_info(). If ignore_errors is\n  false and onerror is None, an\n  exception is raised.You can simply do this :You can of corse use an other filter in you path, for exemple : /YOU/PATH/*.txt for removing all text files in a directory.Expanding on mhawke\'s answer this is what I\'ve implemented. It removes all the content of a folder but not the folder itself. Tested on Linux with files, folders and symbolic links, should work on Windows as well.Using rmtree and recreating the folder could work, but I have run into errors when deleting and immediately recreating folders on network drives.The proposed solution using walk does not work as it uses rmtree to remove folders and then may attempt to use os.unlink on the files that were previously in those folders.  This causes an error.The posted glob solution will also attempt to delete non-empty folders, causing errors.I suggest you use:As a oneliner:A more robust solution accounting for files and directories as well would be (2.7):You might be better off using os.walk() for this.os.listdir() doesn\'t distinguish files from directories and you will quickly get into trouble trying to unlink these. There is a good example of using os.walk() to recursively remove a directory here, and hints on how to adapt it to your circumstances.Notes: in case someone down voted my answer, I have something to explain here.Here\'s a long and ugly, but reliable and efficient solution.It resolves a few problems which are not addressed by the other answerers:Here\'s the code (the only useful function is clear_dir()):I konw it\'s an old thread but I have found something interesting from the official site of python. Just for sharing another idea for removing of all contents in a directory. Because I have some problems of authorization when using shutil.rmtree() and I don\'t want to remove the directory and recreate it. The address original is http://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.walk. Hope that could help someone.Yet Another Solution:This is the only answer so far, which:Code:As many other answers, this does not try to adjust permissions to enable removal of files/directories.An earlier comment also mentions using os.scandir in Python 3.5+.  For example:I used to solve the problem this way:I resolved the error issue with rmtree makedirs by adding time.sleep() between.Answer for a limited, specific situation:\nassuming you want to delete the files while maintainig the subfolders tree, you could use a recursive algorithm:Maybe slightly off-topic, but I think many would find it usefulThis should do the trick just using the OS module to list and then remove!Worked for me, any problems let me know!
