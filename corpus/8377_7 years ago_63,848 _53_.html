Is there a way to grep for something inside a Github project\'s code?I could pull the source and grep it locally, but I was wondering if it\'s possible through the web interface or a 3rd-party alternative.Ideas?Update January 2013: a brand new search has arrived!, based on elasticsearch.org:A search for stat within the ruby repo will be expressed as stat repo:ruby/ruby, and will now just workTM.\n(the repo name is not case sensitive: test repo:wordpress/wordpress returns the same as test repo:Wordpress/Wordpress)Will give:And you have many other examples of search, based on followers, or on forks, or...Update July 2012 (old days of Lucene search and poor code indexing, combined with broken GUI, kept here for archive):  The search (based on SolrQuerySyntax) is now more permissive and the dreaded "Invalid search query. Try quoting it." is gone when using the default search selector "Everything":)(I suppose we can all than Tim Pease, which had in one of his objectives "hacking on improved search experiences for all GitHub properties", and I did mention this Stack Overflow question at the time ;) )Here is an illustration of a grep within the ruby code: it will looks for repos and users, but also for what I wanted to search in the first place: the code!Initial answer and illustration of the former issue (Sept. 2012 => March 2012)You can use the advanced search GitHub form:For instance, Use the repo:username/repo-name directive to limit the search to a code repository.\nThe initial "Advanced Search" page includes the section:Code Search:The Code search will look through all of the code publicly hosted on GitHub. You can also filter by :So if you select the "Code" search selector, then your query grepping for a text within a repo will work:What is incredibly unhelpful from GitHub is that:the error message doesn\'t help you at all.\nNo amount of "quoting it" will get you out of this error.once you get that error message, you don\'t get the sections reminding you of the right association between the search selectors ("Repositories", "Users" or "Language") and the (right) search filters (here "repo:").\nAny further attempt you do won\'t display those associations (selectors-filters) back. Only the error message you see above...\nThe only way to get back those arrays is by clicking the "Advance Search" icon:the "Everything" search selector, which is the default, is actually the wrong one for all of the search filters! Except "language:"...\n(You could imagine/assume that "Everything" would help you to pick whatever search selector actually works with the search filter "repo:", but nope. That would be too easy)you cannot specify the search selector you want through the "Advance Search" field alone!\n(but you can for "language:", even though "Search Language" is another combo box just below the "Search for" \'type\' one...)So, the user\'s experience usually is as follows:So, to recap, if you want to "grep for something inside a Github project\'s code", as the OP Ben Humphreys, don\'t forget to select the "Code" search selector...Recent private repositories have a search field for searching through that repo. Bafflingly, it looks like this functionality is not available to public repositories, though.UPDATEThe bookmarklet hack below is broken due to XHR issues and API changes.Thankfully Github now has "A Whole New Code Search" which does the job superbly.Checkout this voodoo: Github code search\n  userscript.Follow the directions there, or if you hate bloating your browser with\n  scripts and extensions, use my bookmarkified bundle of the userscript:Save the source above as the URL of a new bookmark.

Github is simply not indexing them (as commented originally by @emddudley). They haven\'t stated this anywhere on their website, but they will tell you if you ask support:From: Tim Pease\n  We have stopped adding newly pushed code into our codesearch index. The volume of code has outgrown our current search index, and we are working on moving to a more scalable search architecture. I\'m sorry for the annoyance. We do not have an estimate for when this new search index will be up and running, but when it is ready a blog post will be published (https://github.com/blog).Annoyingly there is no way to tell which repositories are not indexed other than the lack of results (which also could be from a bad query).There also is no way to track this issue other than waiting for them to blog it (or watching here on SO).From: Tim Pease\n  I am afraid our issue tracker is internal, but we can notify you as soon as the new search index is up and running.Google allows you to search in the project, but not the code :(site:https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS test
