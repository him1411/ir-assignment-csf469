I have a PHP file that is sometimes called from a page that has started a session and sometimes from a page that doesn\'t have session started. Therefore when I have session_start() on this script I sometimes get the error message for "session already started". For that I\'ve put these lines:but this time I got this warning message:Notice: Undefined variable: _SESSION Is there a better way to check if session has already started?If I use @session_start will it make things work properly and just shut up the warnings?Recommended way for versions of PHP >= 5.4.0Source: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-status.phpFor versions of PHP < 5.4.0For versions of PHP prior to PHP 5.4.0:Though, IMHO, you should really think about refactoring your session management code if you don\'t know whether or not a session is started...That said, my opinion is subjective, and there are situations (examples of which are described in the comments below) where it may not be possible to know if the session is started.PHP 5.4 introduced session_status(), which is more reliable than relying on session_id().Consider the following snippet:So, to check whether a session is started, the recommended way in PHP 5.4 is now:you can do this, and it\'s really easy.Hope it helps :)Prior to PHP 5.4 there is no reliable way of knowing other than setting a global flag.Consider:Or:So, prior to PHP 5.4 you should set a global boolean.For all php versionCheck this :Source http://php.netUse session_id(), it returns an empty string if not set. It\'s more reliable than checking the $_COOKIE.hope it helps !This should work for all PHP versions. It determines the PHP version, then checks to see if the session is started based on the PHP version. Then if the session is not started it starts it.The only thing you need to do is:You should reorganize your code so that you call session_start() exactly once per page execution.Not sure about efficiency of such solution, but this is from working project\nThis is also used if you need to define the default languageResponse BASED on @Meliza Ramos Response(see first response) and http://php.net/manual/en/function.phpversion.php , ACTIONS:only use openSession()Actually, it is now too late to explain it here anyway as its been solved.\nThis was a .inc file of one of my projects where you configure a menu for a restaurant by selecting a dish and remove/add or change the order.\nThe server I was working at did not had the actual version so I made it more flexible. It\'s up to the authors wish to use and try it out.On PHP 5.3 this works for me:then you have. If you do not put the not at if statement beginning the session will start any way I do not why.  PHP_VERSION_ID is available as of PHP 5.2.7, so check this first and if necessary , create it. \nsession_status is available as of PHP 5.4 , so we have to check this too:Is this code snippet work for you?Replace session_start(); with:
