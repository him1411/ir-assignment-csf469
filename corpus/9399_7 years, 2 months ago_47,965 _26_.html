I have a gitignore file that makes git ignore *.dll files, and that is actually the behavior I want. However, if I want an exception ( i.e. to be able to commit foo.dll), how can I achieve this?Use:From gitignore:An optional prefix ! which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. If a negated pattern matches, this will override lower precedence patterns sources.Git ignores folders if you write:but it can\'t add exceptions if you do:\n!/js/jquery or !/js/jquery/ or !/js/jquery/* You must write: and only then you can except subfolders like thisYou can simply git add -f path/to/foo.dll. .gitignore ignores only files for usual tracking and stuff like git add .Just add ! before an exclusion rule.According to the gitignore man page:Patterns have the following format:...To exclude everything in a directory, but some sub-directories, do the following:Source: https://gist.github.com/444295!foo.dll in .gitignore, or (every time!) git add -f foo.dllSince Git 2.7.0 Git will take exceptions into account. From the official release notes:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.7.0.txtIf you\'re working with Visual Studio and your .dll happens to be in a bin folder, then you\'ll need to add an exception for the particular bin folder itself, before you can add the exception for the .dll file. E.g.This is because the default Visual Studio .gitignore file includes an ignore pattern for [Bbin]/ This pattern is zapping all bin folders (and consequently their contents), which makes any attempt to include the contents redundant (since the folder itself is already ignored).I was able to find why my file wasn\'t being excepted by running from a Git Bash window. This returned the [Bbin]/ pattern.The solution depends on the relation between the git ignore rule and the exception rule:Files/Files in different levels or Files/Subfolders: you can do this:
