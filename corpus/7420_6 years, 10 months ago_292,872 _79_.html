What is the best way to convert:to:With a function like this:Your array already is more-or-less just an object, but arrays do have some "interesting" and special behavior with respect to integer-named properties. The above will give you a plain object.edit oh also you might want to account for "holes" in the array:In modern JavaScript runtimes, you can use the .reduce() method:That one also avoids "holes" in the array, because that\'s how .reduce() works.You could use an accumulator aka reduce.Pass an empty object {} as a starting point; then "augment" that object incrementally.\nAt the end of the iterations, result will be {"0": "a", "1": "b", "2": "c"}If your array is a set of key-value pair objects:will produce: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}For the sake of completeness, reduceRight allows you to iterate over your array in reverse order:will produce: {c:3, b:2, a:1}Your accumulator can be of any type for you specific purpose. For example in order to swap the key and value of your object in an array, pass []:will produce: [{1: "a"}, {2: "b"}, {3: "c"}]Unlike map, reduce may not be used as a 1-1 mapping. You have full control over the items you want to include or exclude. Therefore reduce allows you to achieve what filter does, which makes reduce very versatile:will produce: [{2: "b"}, {3: "c"}]Caution: reduce and Object.key are part of ECMA 5th edition; you should provide a polyfill for browsers that don\'t support them (notably IE8).See a default implementation by Mozilla.ECMAScript 6 introduces the easily polyfillable Object.assign:The Object.assign() method is used to copy the values of all\n  enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target\n  object. It will return the target object.The own length property of the array is not copied because it isn\'t enumerable.If you\'re using jquery:I\'d probably write it this way (since very rarely I\'ll not be having the underscorejs library at hand):For completeness, ECMAScript 2015(ES6) spreading. Will require either a transpiler(Babel) or an environment running at least ES6.Here is an O(1) ES2015 method just for completeness.Surprised not to see -Easy way in modern JavaScript is to use Object.assign() that does nothing but copying key:value from one object to another. In our case, Array donates properties to new {}.Five years later, there\'s a good way :)Object.assign was introduced in ECMAScript 2015.Quick and dirty #2:A quick and dirty one:I would do this simply with Array.of(). Array of has the ability to use it\'s context as a constructor.NOTE 2 The of function is an intentionally generic factory method; it\n  does not require that its this value be the Array constructor.\n  Therefore it can be transferred to or inherited by other constructors\n  that may be called with a single numeric argument.So we may bind Array.of() to a function and generate an array like object.By utilizing Array.of() one can even do array sub-classing.As of Lodash 3.0.0 you can use _.toPlainObjectHere\'s a solution in coffeescriptThis allows you to generate from an array an object with keys you define in the order you want them. console.log(">>> :" + result.onion); will output "paint", the function has to have arrays of equal length or you get an empty object.Here is an updated methodHere\'s a recursive function I just wrote. It\'s simple and works well.Here\'s an example (jsFiddle):Results:\nIf you are using angularjs you can use angular.extend, the same effect with $.extend of jquery.If you can use Map or Object.assign, it\'s very easy.Create an array:The below creates an object with index as keys:Replicate the same as above with MapsConverts to an index based object {0 : \'css\'} etc...Convert to an value based object {css : \'css is great\'} etc...You could use a function like this:This one should handle sparse arrays more efficiently.[docs]or more verboseorshortest one with vanilla JSsome more complex exampleeven shorter (by using function(e) {console.log(e); return e;} === (e)=>(console.log(e),e))[/docs]It\'s not directly relevant but I came here searching for a one liner for merging nested objects such as The solution is to use a combination of reduce and object spread:I have faced this issue multiple times and decided to write a function that is as generic as possible. Have a look and feel free to modify anythingI would use underscore for this, but if that isn\'t available then I would drop down to using reduce with an initial value of empty object {}reduce should be widely available in most browsers today, see MDNusing javascript you can do this forEachIf you like oneliners, and IE8 is not a problem anymore (as it should be)Go ahead and try it on the browser consoleIt coult be more verbose like this:But still rules out IE8. If IE8 is a must, then you can use lodash/underscore like that:It is easy to use javascript reduce:You can take a look at Array.prototype.reduce(), https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduceinitial array and will convert into an Object with keys which will be the unique element of an array and the keys value will be how many times the perticular keys will be repeatingAs you know there are many ways to convert array to object ,one of the simplest way isI ended up using object spread operator, since it is part of the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) standard.Made the following fiddle as an example.
