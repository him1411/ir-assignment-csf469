Is there a Java equivalent for System.IO.Path.Combine() in C#/.NET? Or any code to accomplish this?This static method combines one or more strings into a path.Rather than keeping everything string-based, you should use a class which is designed to represent a file system path.If you\'re using Java 7 or Java 8, you should strongly consider using java.nio.file.Path; Path.resolve can be used to combine one path with another, or with a string. The Paths helper class is useful too. For example:If you need to cater for pre-Java-7 environments, you can use java.io.File, like this:If you want it back as a string later, you can call getPath(). Indeed, if you really wanted to mimic Path.Combine, you could just write something like:In Java 7, you should use resolve:While the NIO2 Path class may seem a bit redundant to File with an unnecessarily different API, it is in fact subtly more elegant and robust.Note that Paths.get() (as suggested by someone else) doesn\'t have an overload taking a Path, and doing Paths.get(path.toString(), childPath) is NOT the same thing as resolve(). resolve() is more intelligent. From the Paths.get() docs:Note that while this method is very convenient, using it will imply an assumed reference to the default FileSystem and limit the utility of the calling code. Hence it should not be used in library code intended for flexible reuse. A more flexible alternative is to use an existing Path instance as an anchor, such as:The sister function to resolve is the excellent relativize:The main answer is to use File objects. However Commons IO does have a class FilenameUtils that can do this kind of thing, such as the concat() method.I know its a long time since Jon\'s original answer, but I had a similar requirement to the OP. By way of extending Jon\'s solution I came up with the following, which will take one or more path segments takes as many path segments that you can throw at it.UsageCode here for others with a similar problemTo enhance JodaStephen\'s answer, Apache Commons IO has FilenameUtils which does this.  Example (on Linux):It\'s platform independent and will produce whatever separators your system needs.platform independent approach (uses File.separator, ie will works depends on operation system where code is running:Here\'s a solution which handles multiple path parts and edge conditions:If you do not need more than strings, you can use com.google.common.io.Filesto get
