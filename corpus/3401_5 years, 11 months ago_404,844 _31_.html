We all know how to form a checkbox input in HTML:What I don\'t know -- what\'s the technically correct value for a checked checkbox? I\'ve seen these all work: Is the answer that it doesn\'t matter? I see no evidence for the answer marked as correct here from the spec itself:Checkboxes (and radio buttons) are on/off switches that may be toggled\n  by the user. A switch is "on" when the control element\'s checked\n  attribute is set. When a form is submitted, only "on" checkbox\n  controls can become successful. Several checkboxes in a form may share\n  the same control name. Thus, for example, checkboxes allow users to\n  select several values for the same property. The INPUT element is used\n  to create a checkbox control.What would a spec writer say is the correct answer? Please provide evidence-based answers.Strictly speaking, you should put something that makes sense - according to the spec here, the most correct version is:For HTML, you can also use the empty attribute syntax, checked="", or even simply checked (for stricter XHTML, this is not supported).Effectively, however, most browsers will support just about any value between the quotes. All of the following will be checked:And only the following will be unchecked:See also this similar question on disabled="disabled".Those are equally valid. And in JavaScript:HTML5 spec:http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#attr-input-checked :The disabled content attribute is a boolean attribute.http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#boolean-attributes :The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or a value that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the attribute\'s canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace.Conclusion:The following are valid, equivalent and true:The following are invalid:The absence of the attribute is the only valid syntax for false:RecommendationIf you care about writing valid XHTML, use checked="checked", since <input checked> is invalid XHTML (but valid HTML) and other alternatives are less readable. Else, just use <input checked> as it is shorter.you want this i think:\nchecked=\'checked\'checked="checked"are equivalent;according to spec checkbox\n\'----\xe2\x93\x98 checked = "checked" or "" (empty string) or empty\n    Specifies that the element represents a selected control.---\'It\'s pretty crazy town that the only way to make checked false is to omit any values. With Angular 1.x, you can do this:which is a lot more sane, if you need to make it unchecked.Well, to use it i dont think matters (similar to disabled and readonly), personally i use checked="checked" but if you are trying to manipulate them with JavaScript, you use true/false
