I want to check whether the "user" key is present or not in the session hash. How can I do this?Note that I don\'t want to check whether the key\'s value is nil or not. I just want to check whether the "user" key is present.Hash\'s key? method tells you whether a given key is present or not.While Hash#has_key? gets the job done, as Matz notes here, it has been deprecated in favour of Hash#key?.In latest Ruby versions Hash instance has a key? method:Be sure to use the symbol key or a string key depending on what you have in your hash:It is very late but preferably symbols should be used as key:But when creating hash if you pass string as key then it will search for the string in keys.But when creating hash you pass symbol as key then has_key? will search the keys by using symbol.If you are using Rails, you can use Hash#with_indifferent_access to avoid this; both hash[:my_key] and hash["my_key"] will point to the same recordYou can always use Hash#key? to check if the key is present in a hash or not. If not it will return you false
