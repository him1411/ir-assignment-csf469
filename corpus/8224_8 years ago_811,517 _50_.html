I have two radio buttons within an HTML form. A dialog box appears when one of the fields is null.  How can I check whether a radio button is selected?Let\'s pretend you have HTML like thisFor client-side validation, here\'s some Javascript to check which one is selected:The above could be made more efficient depending on the exact nature of your markup but that should be enough to get you started.If you\'re just looking to see if any radio button is selected anywhere on the page, PrototypeJS makes it very easy.Here\'s a function that will return true if at least one radio button is selected somewhere on the page.  Again, this might need to be tweaked depending on your specific HTML.For server-side validation (remember, you can\'t depend entirely on Javascript for validation!), it would depend on your language of choice, but you\'d but checking the gender value of the request string.With jQuery, it\'d be something likeLet me break that down into pieces to cover it more clearly.\njQuery processes things from left to right.If you want to avoid this altogether, mark one of the radio buttons as checked (checked="checked") in the HTML code, which would guarantee that one radio button is always selected.A vanilla JavaScript wayHTML CodeJavascript Code:\nJust trying to improve on Russ Cam\'s solution with some CSS selector sugar thrown in with the vanilla JavaScript.No real need for jQuery here, querySelectorAll is widely supported enough now.Edit: fixed a bug with the css selector, I\'ve included the quotes, although you can omit them, in some cases you can\'t so it\'s better to leave them in.The scripts in this page helped me come up with the script below, which I think is more complete and universal. Basically it will validate any number of radio buttons in a form, meaning that it will make sure that a radio option has been selected for each one of the different radio groups within the form. e.g in the test form below: The RadioValidator script will make sure that an answer has been given for both \'test1\' and \'test2\' before it submits. You can have as many radio groups in the form, and it will ignore any other form elements. All missing radio answers will show inside a single alert popup. Here it goes, I hope it helps people. Any bug fixings or helpful modifications welcome :)Note this behavior wit jQuery when getting radio input values:So $(\'input[name="myRadio"]\').val() does not return the checked value of the radio input, as you might expect -- it returns the first radio button\'s value.this is a utility function I\'ve created to solve this problemThis would be valid for radio buttons sharing the same name, no JQuery needed.     If we are talking about checkboxes and we want a list with the checkboxes checked sharing a name:With mootools (http://mootools.net/docs/core/Element/Element)html:js:http://www.somacon.com/p143.php/With JQuery, another way to check the current status of the radio buttons is to get the attribute \'checked\'.For Example:In this case you can check the buttons using:This code will alert the selected radio button when the form is submitted. It used jQuery to get the selected value.just a lil bit modification to Mark Biek ;HTML CODE and Javascript code to check if radio button is selectedHere is the solution which is expanded upon to not go ahead with submission and send an alert if the radio buttons are not checked. Of course this would mean you have to have them unchecked to begin with!Just remember to set the id (\'radio1\',\'radio2\' or whatever you called it) in the form for each of the radio buttons or the script will not work.An example:The formThe scriptThe fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/PNpUS/Give radio buttons, same name but different IDs.I just want to ensure something gets selected (using jQuery):If you want vanilla JavaScript, don\'t want to clutter your markup by adding IDs on each radio button, and only care about modern browsers, the following functional approach is a little more tasteful to me than a for loop:If neither is checked, it will return undefined (though you could change the line above to return something else, e.g., to get false returned, you could change the relevant line above to: }).pop() || {value:false}).value;).There is also the forward-looking polyfill approach since the RadioNodeList interface should make it easy to just use a value property on the list of form child radio elements (found in the above code as formElement[radioName]), but that has its own problems: How to polyfill RadioNodeList?This is also working, avoiding to call for an element id but calling it using as an array element.The following code is based on the fact that an array, named as the radiobuttons group, is composed by radiobuttons elements in the same order as they where declared in the html document:HTML:JAVAScript:
