I have a case where I must write inline CSS code, and I want to apply a hover style on an anchor.How can I use a:hover in inline CSS inside the HTML style attribute?E.g. you can\'t reliably use CSS classes in HTML emails.Short answer: you can\'t.Long answer: you shouldn\'t. Give it a class name or an id and use stylesheets to apply the style.:hover is a pseudo-selector and, for CSS, only has meaning within the style sheet. There isn\'t any inline-style equivalent (as it isn\'t defining the selection criteria). Response to the OP\'s comments:See Totally Pwn CSS with Javascript for a good script on adding CSS rules dynamically. Also see Change style sheet for some of the theory on the subject.Also, don\'t forget, you can add links to external stylesheets if that\'s an option. For example,Caution: the above assumes there is a head section. You can get the same effect by changing your styles with JavaScript in the onMouseOver and onMouseOut parameters, although it\'s extremely inefficient if you need to change more than one element:Also, I can\'t remember for sure if this works in this context. You may have to switch it with document.getElementById(\'idForLink\').More accurate to say, you could do it at some point in the past. But now (according to the latest revision of the same standard, which is Candidate Recommendation) you can\'t\n    ...I\'m extremely late contributing to this, however I was sad to see no one suggested this, if you actually require inline code, this is possible to do. I needed it for some hover buttons, the method is this:In this case, the inline code: "background-color: red;" is the switch colour on hover, put the colour you need into there and then this solution works. I realise this may not be the perfect solution in terms of compatibility however this works if it is absolutely needed.or a bit harder method:element.style.fontSize="12px"You can\'t do exactly what you\'re describing, since a:hover is part of the selector, not the CSS rules. A stylesheet has two components:Inline styles only have rules; the selector is implicit to be the current element.The selector is an expressive language that describes a set of criteria to match elements in an XML-like document.However, you can get close, because a style set can technically go most anywhere:Inline pseudoclass declarations aren\'t supported in the current iteration of CSS (though, from what I understand, it may come in a future version).For now, your best bet is probably to just define a style block directly above the link you want to style:Hover is a pseudo class, and thus cannot be applied with a style attribute. It is part of the selector.According to your comments, you\'re sending a JavaScript file anyway. Do the rollover in JavaScript. jQuery\'s $.hover() method makes it easy, as does every other JavaScript wrapper. It\'s not too hard in straight JavaScript either.As pointed out, you cannot set arbitrary inline styles for hover, but you can change the style of the hover cursor in CSS using the following in the appropriate tag:There is no way to do this. Your options are to use a JavaScript or a CSS block.Maybe there is some JavaScript library that will convert a proprietary style attribute to a style block. But then the code will not be standard-compliant.I just figured out a different solution. My issue: I have an <a> tag around some slides/main content viewer as well as <a> tags in the footer. I want them to go to the same place in IE, so the whole paragraph would be underlined onHover, even though they\'re not links: the slide as a whole is a link. IE doesn\'t know the difference. I also have some actual links in my footer that do need the underline and color change onHover. I thought I would have to put styles inline with the footer tags to make the color change, but advice from above suggests that this is impossible. Solution: I gave the footer links two different classes, and my problem was solved. I was able to have the onHover color change in one class, have the slides onHover have no color change/underline, and still able to have the external HREFS in the footer and the slides at the same time! I agree with shadow. You could use the onmouseover and onmouseout event to change the CSS via JavaScript. And don\'t say people need to have JavaScript activated, bla bla. That\'s their own problem. It\'s only a style issue, so it doesn\'t matter if there are some visitors without JavaScript ;)\nAlthough most of Web 2.0 works with JavaScript. See Facebook for example (lots of JavaScript) or Myspace.You COULD just use JavaScript if all else fails. It\'s not the most practical solution, but it might serve your purposes.My problem was that I\'m building a website which uses a lot of image-icons that have to be swapped by a different image on hover (e.g. blue-ish images turn red-ish on hover).\nI produced the following solution for this:I introduced a container containing the pair of images. The first is visible and the other is hidden (display:none). When hovering the container, the first becomes hidden (display:none) and the second shows up again (display:block).You can use the pseudo-class a:hover in external style sheets only. Therefore I recommend using an external style sheet. The code is:You can do id by adding a class but never inline.2 lines but you can re-use the class everywhere.
