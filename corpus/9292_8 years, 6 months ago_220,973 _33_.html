I have found several open-source/freeware programs that allow you to convert .doc files to .pdf files, but they\'re all of the application/printer driver variety, with no SDK attached.I have found several programs that do have an SDK allowing you to convert .doc files to .pdf files, but they\'re all of the proprietary type, $2,000 a license or thereabouts.Does anyone know of any clean, inexpensive (preferably free) programmatic solution to my problem, using C# or VB.NET?Thanks!Use a foreach loop instead of a for loop - it solved my problem.Here is a modification of a program that worked for me.  It uses Word 2007 with the Save As PDF add-in installed.  It searches a directory for .doc files, opens them in Word and then saves them as a PDF.  Note that you\'ll need to add a reference to Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word to the solution.To sum it up for vb.net users, the free option (must have office installed):Microsoft office assembies download:pia for office 2007Add reference to Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.ApplicationAdd using or import (vb.net) statement to Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.ApplicationVB.NET example:PDFCreator has a COM component, callable from .NET or VBScript (samples included in the download). But, it seems to me that a printer is just what you need - just mix that with Word\'s automation, and you should be good to go.There\'s an entire discussion of libraries for converting Word to PDF on Joel\'s discussion forums.  Some suggestions from the thread:I do this as part of a release process - convert a Word Doc to PDF.http://www.suodenjoki.dk/us/productions/articles/word2pdf.htm\nand\nhttp://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=3772&highlight=pdf+formnot exactly programmatically, but may help you.When I stumbled upon some problems with server side office automation we looked into the technique described here on codeproject.\nIt uses the portable version (which can be deployed via xcopy) of OpenOffice in combination with a macro.\nAlthough we haven\'t done the switch ourselves yet, it looks very promissing.Just wanted to add that I used Microsoft.Interop libraries, specifically ExportAsFixedFormat function which I did not see used in this thread.I went through the Word to PDF pain when someone dumped me with 10000 word files to convert to PDF. Now I did it in C# and used Word interop but it was slow and crashed if I tried to use PC at all.. very frustrating.This lead me to discovering I could dump interops and their slowness..... for Excel I use (EPPLUS) and then I discovered that you can get a free tool called Spire that allows converting to PDF... with limitations! http://www.e-iceblue.com/Introduce/free-doc-component.html#.VtAg4PmLRhESeems to be some relevent info here:Converting MS Word Documents to PDF in ASP.NETAlso, with Office 2007 having publish to PDF functionality, I guess you could use office automation to open the *.DOC file in Word 2007 and Save as PDF.  I\'m not too keen on office automation as it\'s slow and prone to hanging, but just throwing that out there...I used ABCpdf which is a programmatic option and wasn\'t too expensive, $300/license.  It works with either OpenOffice, or falls back to Word if OpenOffice isn\'t available.  The setup was a bit tricky with the OpenOffice COM permissions, but it was definitely worth outsourcing that part of the app.Microsoft PDF add-in for word seems to be the best solution for now but you should take into consideration that it does not convert all word documents correctly to pdf and in some cases you will see huge difference between the word and the output pdf. Unfortunately I couldn\'t find any api that would convert all word documents correctly.\nThe only solution I found to ensure the conversion was 100% correct was by converting the documents through a printer driver. The downside is that documents are queued and converted one by one, but you can be sure the resulted pdf is exactly the same as word document layout.\nI personally preferred using UDC (Universal document converter) and installed Foxit Reader(free version) on server too then printed the documents by starting a "Process" and setting its Verb property to "print". You can also use FileSystemWatcher to set a signal when the conversion has completed.As long as you have Word 2010 or later installed you can use DocTo which provides a commandline application to do this.I have been impressed with Gembox (http://www.gemboxsoftware.com/) who provide a limited free edition of document management (includes pdf conversion). They also do libraries for spreadsheets. The 1 developer licence if you exceed their limits (which I imagine you will) though is around $580 (http://www.gemboxsoftware.com/document/pricelist). OK, it\'s not free (or in my opinion relatively inexpensive) but it is a lot cheaper than $2000. As I understand it from their price list there is no royalty either for server deployments. Might be worth approaching them and seeing if they\'ll do a deal if you don\'t want to roll your own.I have used iTextSharp to generate PDFs before.  It\'s an open source port of iText from the Java world and is pretty powerful.I haven\'t explicitly done a Word to PDF conversion, but I have programmatically created and manipulated PDFs with it.Here is another link to to the project.
