In Android applications such as Twitter (official app), when you encounter a ListView, you can pull it down (and it will bounce back when released) to refresh the content.I wonder what is the best way, in your opinion, to implement that?Some possibilities I could think of:Any recommendations?P.S. I wonder when the official Twitter app source code is released. It has been mentioned that it will be released, but 6 months has passed and we haven\'t heard about it since then.Finally, Google released an official version of pull-to-refresh library! It is called SwipeRefreshLayout, inside the support library, and the documentation is here:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/SwipeRefreshLayout.htmlI\'ve made an attempt to implement a pull to refresh component, it\'s far from complete but demonstrates a possible implementation, https://github.com/johannilsson/android-pulltorefresh.Main logic is implemented in PullToRefreshListView that extends ListView. Internally it controls the scrolling of a header view using smoothScrollBy (API Level 8). The widget is now updated with support for 1.5 and later, please read the README for 1.5 support though.In your layouts you simply add it like this.I\'ve also implemented a robust, open source, easy to use and highly customizable PullToRefresh library for Android. You can replace your ListView with the PullToRefreshListView as described in the documentation on the project page.https://github.com/erikwt/PullToRefresh-ListViewThe easiest way i think is as provided by the android support library:android.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout;once that is imported then you can have your layout defined as follows:I assume that you use recycler view instead of listview. However, listview still works so you just need to replace recyclerview with listview and update the references in the java code (Fragment).In your activity fragment, you first implement the interface, SwipeRefreshLayout.OnRefreshListener:\ni,e Hope this helps the massesIn this link, you can find a fork of the famous PullToRefresh view that has new interesting implementations like PullTorRefreshWebView or PullToRefreshGridView or the possibility to add a PullToRefresh on the bottom edge of a list.https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefreshAnd the best of it is that work perfect in Android 4.1 (the normal PullToRefresh doesn\'t work )I have very easy way to do this but now sure its the foolproof way\nThere is my code\nPullDownListView.javaYou just need to implement ListViewTouchEventListener on your activity where you want to use this ListView and set the listenerI have it implemented in PullDownListViewActivity It works for me :)To implement android Pull-to-Refresh try this piece of code,Activity class:Nobody have mention the new type of "Pull to refresh" which shows on top of the action bar like in the Google Now or Gmail application. There is a library ActionBar-PullToRefresh which works exactly the same.Note there are UX issues to contend with when implementing on Android and WP."A great indicator for why designers/devs should not implement pull-to-refresh in the style iOS apps do is how Google and their teams never use pull-to-refresh on Android while they do use it in iOS.

Works with:To get the latest Lollipop Pull-To Refresh:Detailed guide could be found here: http://antonioleiva.com/swiperefreshlayout/Plus for ListView I recommend to read about canChildScrollUp() in the comments ;)Very interesting Pull-to-Refresh by Yalantis.\nGif for iOS, but you can check it :)
