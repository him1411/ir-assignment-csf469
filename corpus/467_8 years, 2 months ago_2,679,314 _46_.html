How do I get the selected value from a dropdown list using JavaScript?I tried the methods below but they all return the selected index instead of the value:If you have a select element that looks like this:Running this code:Would make strUser be 2. If what you actually want is test2, then do this:Which would make strUser be test2Plain JavaScript:jQuery:AngularJS: (http://jsfiddle.net/qk5wwyct):This is correct and should give you the value.\nIs it the text you\'re after?So you\'re clear on the terminology:This option has:The following code exhibits various examples related to getting/putting of values from input/select fields using JavaScript.Working DEMOThe following script is getting the value of the selected option and putting it in text box 1The following script is getting a value from a text box 2 and alerting with its valueThe following script is calling a function from a functionIf you ever run across code written purely for IE you might see this:Running the above in Firefox et al will give you an \'is not a function\' error because IE allows you to get away with using () instead of []:The correct way is to use square brackets.Beginners are likely to want to access values from a select with the NAME attribute rather than ID attribute. We know all form elements need names, even before they get ids.So, I\'m adding the getElementByName() solution just for new developers to see too.NB. names for form elements will need to be unique for your form to be usable once posted, but the DOM can allow a name be shared by more than one element. For that reason consider adding IDs to forms if you can, or be explicit with form element names my_nth_select_named_x and my_nth_text_input_named_y.Example using getElementByName:Just use$(\'#SelectBoxId option:selected\').text(); for getting the text as listed$(\'#SelectBoxId\').val(); for getting the selected index valueThe previous answers still leave room for improvement because of the possibilities, the intuitiveness of the code, and the use of id versus name. One can get a read-out of three data of a selected option -- its index number, its value and its text. This simple, cross-browser code does all three: Live demo: http://jsbin.com/jiwena/1/edit?html,output . id should be used for make-up purposes. For functional form purposes, name is still valid, also in HTML5, and should still be used. Lastly, mind the use square versus round brackets in certain places. As was explained before, only (older versions of) IE will accept round ones in all places.   Refer to the article Selecting dropdown element using JavaScript or jQuery. They have explained it in many ways using JavaScript and jQuery.Using jQuery:In 2015, in Firefox, the following also works.e.options.selectedIndexThe only reason I can see that makes this code not work is if you\'re using IE7-, and forgot to specify the value attribute for your <option>-tags... Every other browser should convert what\'s inside open-close tags as the option value.Here is a JavaScript code line:Assuming that the dropdown menu named list name="list" and included in a form with name attribute name="form1".To go along with the above answers, this is how I do it as a one-liner. This is for getting the actual text of the selected option. There are good examples for getting the index number already. (And for the text, I just wanted to show this way)In some rare instances you may need to use parentheses, but this would be very rare.I doubt this processes any faster than the two line version. I simply like to consolidate my code as much as possible.If anyone knows how to do this in one line without having to get the element twice, I would love for you to comment and show me how. I haven\'t been able to figure that out yet...Running example of how it works:Note: The values don\'t change as the dropdown is changed, if you require that functionality then an onClick change is to be implemented.Here\'s an easy way to do it in an onchange function:event.target.options[event.target.selectedIndex].dataset.name
