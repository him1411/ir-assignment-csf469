I know this question has been asked before and I have seen a plethora of solutions out there, yet none seem to work for me.  I was able to build my apk without issues until this error started cropping up.  I have tried cleaning my project, removing it from the workspace and reimporting it, removing "Java Builder" from my Builders for the project, building the project manually, reordering my java build path.  I have no visible compiler issues and no problems exist in my workspace.  I did experience this issue before and solved it once by removing the project form my workspace and re-importing it and another time I solved it by removing "Java Builder" from my java build path.  None seem to work this time.  I currently have most of the settings set back to default (i.e. java build is checked again).I am running windows 7 (64 bit) and using jdk1.6.0_21 via Eclipse 3.6.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I have lost loads of development time troubleshooting this already.[Update] My locale is English & I have tried removing the debug.keystore, United States as related to issue 834Please follow these steps; this might help you out:Right-click your app project and go to PropertiesSelect Android from left-hand side listUncheck the "Is Library" checkboxIf your app project relies on library projects which are in your workspace, those of course need to have the "Is Library" box checked.deleting the R.Java file in /Gen folder did the trick for meI tried all the above solutions. but it didn\'t work.The solution was to restart eclipse !!!!!!!hope this will help someone :)In my case this problem started after eclipse updated the plugin with the v4.0 API release. I fixed it by going to the main preferences for Eclipse and under Android->Build uncheck \'Skip packaging and dexing until export or launch\'Note: if you eclipse gives you the Unknown Command \'crunch\' error then follow this postI\'ve tried to gather the best of other peoples answers into a step by step list of things to try in order:If you complete the above list, and still haven\'t solved the issue, please leave a comment, or if you find something else that works, feel free to edit the answer and add your thing in.Delete the project from your workspace & import again.\nThis worked for me.Can\'t believe similar issue has been there since 2008.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=834.i\'m no expert, but eclipse on Windows, doing android apps, refuses to create the default.properties file (in the app root directory).  I\'ve just copied one from another app and it works fine.  Simple contents, for Android 2.2 project it just says (ignoring comments):target=android-8fwiwI was having the same issue as the OP except that all these suggestions did not work. I found a solution for me.Make sure that "Skip packaging and dexing until export or launch." is selected.Go to Window -> Preferences -> Android -> Build. Just make sure that option is selected and apply.I know this does not make a lot of sense, but having it unselected was giving me this error and with it selected it goes away and the apk is installed.I am using the auto generated ant build script from android and ONLY using it as my build process in eclipse. I am not using any other build methods.I figured it out.  I was referencing JavaSE-1.5 and using JDK 1.6.  I changed it to use 1.6 and that appears to fix it.  Seems like through my research that is an overloaded error message that covers a lot of error cases.I just fixed this by reselecting a default JRE for the execution environment (JRE6 for JavaSE-1.6 in my case). It got unchecked for some reason.This fixed my problem.  I kept getting the console error in eclipse "Could not find com_android_vending_licensing.apk" and even though it didnt seem to effect the way my app ran, it was annoying.  So going into the com_android_vending_licensing project properties and unchecking the "is library" option, building the project to produce the needed apk and then going back into the com_android_vending_licensing project properties and re checking the "is library" check box fixed the problem.Run Eclipse as "Administrator" and then import the project.None of these things worked for me. I\'m trying to access native code through the jni, first with NDK samples. What I found was the build won\'t run if jarlist.cache is not present in the project bin directory. If I copy one from another project to that location (may need to refresh to see the folder in Eclipse), build works every time.Clean the project and it will do. Sometimes it happens unknowingly but keep trying to solve using diff methods.I had somehow done a Run configuration as a Java application instead of a Android. the problem for me was I was trying to use IBM RAD which appears to not work properly for this, I installed Eclipse and now have a different error but I should be able to get past itOn my machine (Windows7, 64bit) I could fix this by setting my execution environment to a 32bit variant of the jdk (I used 1.6.0_23). And I tried a lot of things before...SHA1\'s answer did it for me: after updating to the latest sdk/adt, my project refused to build an apk; unchecking the option resolved the issue. I don\'t know if the update checked this, or if it was checked before but the new adt screwed things up, but things work again now :)In my case this worked : Delete R.Java file in /Gen folder+Delete all "R.Android" imports that Eclipse added to some of my java classes !!!and rebuild the project.remove -- R.java -- Clean the project and run again.. this worked for me ..Find the project\'s folder in your system, enter it\'s Properties via context menu and deselect "Read only" option. Worked in my case.This seems to be the source of the problem in many cases, moreover some solutions up there base on copying/rewriting the files in the project what makes them non-read-only.This is caused by JAVA_HOME not being set correctly. It can be easily resolved by following the steps in this article.Mine was caused by this problem (incompatibility between ADT and SDK), and was fixed thus:I my case, I had to switch from API 21 to API 19, clean and build and everything was fine again. I am using a Mac and apparently API 21 is not fully supported on Yosemite.
