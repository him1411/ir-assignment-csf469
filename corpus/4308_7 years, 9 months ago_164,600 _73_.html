EDIT: Use http://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor; This is an old question and the code example is made with an outdated Node.js API. Any ideas on how I could implement an auto-reload of files in Node.js? I\'m tired of restarting the server every time I change a file. \nApparently Node.js\' require() function does not reload files if they already have been required, so I need to do something like this:And in the app.js file I have:But this also isn\'t working - I get an error in the process.compile() statement saying that \'require\' is not defined. process.compile is evaling the app.js, but has no clue about the node.js globals.A good, up to date alternative to supervisor is nodemon:Monitor for any changes in your node.js application and automatically restart the server - perfect for developmentTo use nodemon:node-supervisor is awesomeusage to restart on save:by isaacs - http://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisori found a simple way:nodemon came up first in a google search, and it seems to do the trick:If somebody still comes to this question and wants to solve it using only the standard modules I made a simple example:This example is only for one file (server.js), but can be adapted to multiple files using an array of files, a for loop to get all file names, or by watching a directory:This code was made for Node.js 0.8 API, it is not adapted for some specific needs but will work in some simple apps.UPDATE:\nThis functional is implemented in my module simpleR, GitHub repoThere is Node-Supervisor that you can install bysee http://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisorEdit: My answer is obsolete. Node.js is a very fast changing technology.I also wondered about reloading modules. I modified node.js and have published the source at Github at nalply/node. The only difference is the function require. It has an optional second argument reload.To reload app.js in current directory useWrite something like this, and you have auto-reload:The only problem I see is the variable module, but I am working at it now.yet another solution for this problem is using foreverAnother useful capability of Forever is that it can optionally restart\n  your application when any source files have changed. This frees you\n  from having to manually restart each time you add a feature or fix a\n  bug. To start Forever in this mode, use the  -w flag: There was a recent thread about this subject on the node.js mailing list.  The short answer is no, it\'s currently not possible auto-reload required files, but several people have developed patches that add this feature. Take a look at require.hot() patch by Felix Geisend\xc3\xb6rfer. I use it with modified Nerve framework.EDIT: link no longer works, node repo moved to nodejs/node, discarding all very old commits, it seems.Here is a blog post about Hot Reloading for Node. It provides a github Node branch that you can use to replace your installation of Node to enable Hot Reloading.From the blog:Now, any time you modify myRequestHandler.js, the above code will no\xc2\xadtice and re\xc2\xadplace the local re\xc2\xadquestHandler with the new code.

Apparently, one could just remove the module from the "require" cache and have the job done. Since I\'m not keen to change directly the node source code, I came up with a very hacky-hack that is: search in the stack trace the last call to the "require" function, grab a reference to it\'s "cache" field and..well, delete the reference to the node:\n\nEven easier, actually:Apparently, this works just fine. I have absolutely no idea of what that arguments["1"] means, but it\'s doing its job. I believe that the node guys will implement a reload facility someday, so I guess that for now this solution is acceptable too.\n(btw. my "thing" will be here: https://github.com/cheng81/wirez , go there in a couple of weeks and you should see what I\'m talking about)node-dev works great. npm install node-devIt even gives a desktop notification when the server is reloaded and will give success or errors on the message.start your app on command line with:node-dev app.jssolution at: \nhttp://github.com/shimondoodkin/node-hot-reloadnotice that you have to take care by yourself of the references used.that means if you did : var x=require(\'foo\'); y=x;z=x.bar; and hot reloaded\nit.it means you have to replace the references stored in x, y and z. in the hot reaload callback function.some people confuse hot reload with auto restart\nmy nodejs-autorestart module also has upstart integration to enable auto start on boot.\nif you have a small app auto restart is fine, but when you have a large app hot reload is more suitable. simply because hot reload is faster.Also I like my node-inflow module.Not necessary to use nodemon or other tools like that. Just use capabilities of your IDE. Probably best one is IntelliJ WebStorm with hot reload feature (automatic server and browser reload) for node.js.Use this:All you have to do now is:And config will automatically get reloaded :)loaddir is my solution for quick loading of a directory, recursively.can return { \'path/to/file\': \'fileContents...\' }\nor \n{ path: { to: { file: \'fileContents\'} } }It has callback which will be called when the file is changed.It handles situations where files are large enough that watch gets called before they\'re done writing.I\'ve been using it in projects for a year or so, and just recently added promises to it.Help me battle test it!https://github.com/danschumann/loaddirYou can use auto-reload to reload the module without shutdown the server.data.jsontest.jsResult:another simple solution is to use fs.readFile instead of using require\nyou can save a text file contaning a json object, and create a interval on the server to reload this object.pros:cons:For people using Vagrant and PHPStorm, file watcher is a faster approachdisable immediate sync of the files so you run the command only on save then create a scope for the *.js files and working directories and add this command vagrant ssh -c "/var/www/gadelkareem.com/forever.sh restart"where forever.sh is likeI recently came to this question because the usual suspects were not working with linked packages. If you\'re like me and are taking advantage of npm link during development to effectively work on a project that is made up of many packages, it\'s important that changes that occur in dependencies trigger a reload as well. After having tried node-mon and pm2, even following their instructions for additionally watching the node_modules folder, they still did not pick up changes. Although there are some custom solutions in the answers here, for something like this, a separate package is cleaner. I came across node-dev today and it works perfectly without any options or configuration.From the Readme:In contrast to tools like supervisor or nodemon it doesn\'t scan the filesystem for files to be watched. Instead it hooks into Node\'s require() function to watch only the files that have been actually required.
