I need to warn users about unsaved changes before they leave a page (a pretty common problem). This works but it raises a default dialog with an irritating standard message that wraps my own text. I need to either completely replace the standard message, so my text is clear, or (even better) replace the entire dialog with a modal dialog using jQuery.So far I have failed and I haven\'t found anyone else who seems to have an answer. Is it even possible?Javascript in my page:The closeIt() function:Using jQuery and jqModal I have tried this kind of thing (using a custom confirm dialog):which also doesn\'t work - I cannot seem to bind to the beforeunload event. You can\'t modify the default dialogue for onbeforeunload, so your best bet may be to work with it.Here\'s a reference to this from Microsoft:When a string is assigned to the returnValue property of window.event, a dialog box appears that gives users the option to stay on the current page and retain the string that was assigned to it. The default statement that appears in the dialog box, "Are you sure you want to navigate away from this page? ... Press OK to continue, or Cancel to stay on the current page.", cannot be removed or altered.The problem seems to be:The result is, there doesn\'t seem to be a way of assigning false to onbeforeunload to prevent it from the default dialogue.Additional notes on jQuery:jQuery doesn\'t have a shortcut for onbeforeunload so you\'d have to use the generic bind syntax.Owen is correct. And, the reason behind this is security. Preventing a page from unloading is useful in web forms and such, but it can easily be exploited by a malicious site to fool the user into staying on a page. That\'s why web browsers implement the standard message and have this mechanism for inserting custom text.What worked for me (IE8, Chrome, Firefox)  is:It is important not to return anything if no prompt is required as there are differences between IE and other browser behaviours here.While there isn\'t anything you can do about the box in some circumstances, you can intercept someone clicking on a link. For me, this was worth the effort for most scenarios and as a fallback, I\'ve left the unload event.I\'ve used Boxy instead of the standard jQuery Dialog, it is available here: http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/boxy/You could attach to another event, and filter more on what kind of anchor was clicked, but this works for me and what I want to do and serves as an example for others to use or improve. Thought I would share this for those wanting this solution.I have cut out code, so this may not work as is.1) Use onbeforeunload, not onunload.2) The important thing is to avoid executing a return statement. I don\'t mean, by this, to avoid returning from your handler. You return all right, but you do it by ensuring that you reach the end of the function and DO NOT execute a return statement. Under these conditions the built-in standard dialog does not occur.3) You can, if you use onbeforeunload, run an ajax call in your unbeforeunload handler to tidy up on the server, but it must be a synchronous one, and you have to wait for and handle the reply in your onbeforeunload handler (still respecting condition (2) above). I do this and it works fine. If you do a synchronous ajax call, everything is held up until the response comes back. If you do an asynchronous one, thinking that you don\'t care about the reply from the server, the page unload continues and your ajax call is aborted by this process - including a remote script if it\'s running.You can detect which button (ok or cancel) pressed by user, because the onunload function called only when the user choise leaveing the page. Althoug in this funcion the possibilities is limited, because the DOM is being collapsed. You can run javascript, but the ajax POST doesn\'t do anything therefore you can\'t use this methode for automatic logout. But there is a solution for that. The window.open(\'logout.php\') executed in the onunload funcion, so the user will logged out with a new window opening.This code called when user leave the page or close the active window and user logged out by \'logout.php\'.\nThe new window close immediately when logout php consist of code:This can\'t be done in chrome now to avoid spamming, refer to javascript onbeforeunload not showing custom message for more details.Try placing a return; instead of a message.. this is working most browsers for me.\n(This only really prevents dialog\'s presents)I faced the same problem, I was ok to get its own dialog box with my message, but the problem I faced was :\n1) It was giving message on all navigations I want it only for close click. \n2) with my own confirmation message if user selects cancel it still shows the browser\'s default dialog box.Following is the solutions code I found, which I wrote on my Master page.refer from http://www.codeprojectdownload.comI had this same problem and it was driving me crazy. I wanted to completely get rid of the pop-up because I didn\'t want to warn the user -- just take them from a form to a new page. I tried the above answers and couldn\'t get any to work.Eventually, I got this to disregard the default firefox popup, with the help of this site:  http://code-maven.com/prevent-leaving-the-page-using-plain-javascript. It\'s added before you redirect the window: What about to use the specialized version of the "bind" command "one". Once the event handler executes the first time, it\xe2\x80\x99s automatically removed as an event handler.
