I have two dates of the form:Now I need to find the difference between these two in the following form:How can I do this in PHP?For PHP < 5.3 otherwise see jurka\'s answer belowYou can use strtotime() to convert two dates to unix time and then calculate the number of seconds between them. From this it\'s rather easy to calculate different time periods.Edit: Obviously the preferred way of doing this is like described by jurka below. My code is generally only recommended if you don\'t have PHP 5.3 or better. Several people in the comments have pointed out that the code above is only an approximation. I still believe that for most purposes that\'s fine, since the usage of a range is more to provide a sense of how much time has passed or remains rather than to provide precision - if you want to do that, just output the date. Despite all that, I\'ve decided to address the complaints. If you truly need an exact range but haven\'t got access to PHP 5.3, use the code below (it should work in PHP 4 as well). This is a direct port of the code that PHP uses internally to calculate ranges, with the exception that it doesn\'t take daylight savings time into account. That means that it\'s off by an hour at most, but except for that it should be correct.I suggest to use DateTime and DateInterval objects.read more php DateTime::diff manualFrom the manual:As of PHP 5.2.2, DateTime objects can be compared using comparison operators. The best course of action is using PHP\'s DateTime (and DateInterval) objects. Each date is encapsulated in a DateTime object, and then a difference between the two can be made:The DateTime object will accept any format strtotime() would. If an even more specific date format is needed, DateTime::createFromFormat() can be used to create the DateTime object.After both objects were instantiated, you substract one from the other with DateTime::diff().$difference now holds a DateInterval object with the difference information. A var_dump() looks like this:To format the DateInterval object, we\'ll need check each value and exclude it if it\'s 0:All that\'s left now is to call our function on the $difference DateInterval object:And we get the correct result:20 days 6 hours 56 minutes 30 secondsThe complete code used to achieve the goal:View Hours and Minuts and Seconds..I voted for jurka\'s answer as that\'s my favorite, but I have a pre-php.5.3 version...I found myself working on a similar problem - which is how I got to this question in the first place - but just needed a difference in hours.  But my function solved this one pretty nicely as well and I don\'t have anywhere in my own library to keep it where it won\'t get lost and forgotten, so... hope this is useful to someone.And the test: And the result:I got the original idea from here, which I modified for my uses (and I hope my modification will show on that page as well).You can very easily remove intervals you don\'t want (say "week") by removing them from the $aIntervals array, or maybe adding an $aExclude parameter, or just filter them out when you output the string.Take a look at the following link. This is the best answer I\'ve found so far.. :)It doesn\'t matter which date is earlier or later when you pass in the\n  date parameters. The function uses the PHP ABS() absolute value to\n  always return a postive number as the number of days between the two\n  dates.Keep in mind that the number of days between the two dates is NOT\n  inclusive of both dates. So if you are looking for the number of days\n  represented by all the dates between and including the dates entered,\n  you will need to add one (1) to the result of this function.For example, the difference (as returned by the above function)\n  between 2013-02-09 and 2013-02-14 is 5. But the number of days or\n  dates represented by the date range 2013-02-09 - 2013-02-14 is 6.http://www.bizinfosys.com/php/date-difference.htmlI don\'t know if you are using a PHP framework or not, but a lot of PHP frameworks have date/time libraries and helpers to help keep you from reinventing the wheel.For example CodeIgniter has the timespan() function. Simply input two Unix timestamps and it will automatically generate a result like this:http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/helpers/date_helper.htmli suggest to use this code to get difference between date.You can use thefunction which returns an array containing all elements of the date/time supplied:If your start and end dates are in string format then usebefore the above codeI have some simple logic for that:This is my function. Required PHP >= 5.3.4. It use DateTime class. Very fast, quick and can do the difference between two dates or even the so called "time since".This will try to detect whether a timestamp was given or not, and will also return future dates/times as negative values:Example usage:Or:"if" the date is stored in MySQL, I find it easier to do the difference calculation at the database level... Then based on the Day, Hour, Min, Sec output, parse and display results as appropriate...I found your article on the following page, which contains a number of references for PHP date time calculations.Calculate the difference between two Dates (and time) using PHP. The following page provides a range of different methods (7 in total) for performing date / time calculations using PHP, to determine the difference in time (hours, munites), days, months or years between two dates.See PHP Date Time \xe2\x80\x93 7 Methods to Calculate the Difference between 2 dates.You can also use following code to return date diff by round fractions up\n    $date1 = $duedate; // assign due date\n    echo $date2 = date("Y-m-d"); // current date \n    $ts1 = strtotime($date1); \n    $ts2 = strtotime($date2);\n    $seconds_diff = $ts1 - $ts2;\n    echo $datediff = ceil(($seconds_diff/3600)/24); // return in daysIf you use floor method of php instead of ceil it will return you the round fraction down. Please check the difference here, some times if your staging servers timezone is different then the live site time zone in that case you may get different results so change the conditions accordingly.I had the same problem with PHP 5.2 and solved it with MySQL. Might not be exactly what you\'re looking for, but this will do the trick and return the number of days:More info here http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_datediffVery simple:Please checkout the following link for details:PHP: date_diff - ManualNote that it\'s for PHP  5.3.0 or greater.For php version >=5.3 : Create two date objects and then use date_diff() function. It will return php DateInterval object. see documentationI\'m using the following function which I wrote, when PHP 5.3 (respectively date_diff()) is not available:DateInterval is great but it has a couple of caveats:To overcome that, I coded the following (improved from @enobrev answer):It runs two loops; the first one deals with the relative intervals (years and months) via brute-forcing, and the second one computes the additional absolute intervals with simple arithmetic (so it\'s faster):An easy functionuse likeecho time_difference ($time_1, $time_2);Since everyone is posting code samples, here is another version.I wanted a function to display differences from seconds to years (just one unit). For periods over 1 day, I wanted it to rollover at midnight (10am Monday seen from 9am Wednesday is 2 days ago, not 1). And for periods over a month, I wanted the rollover to be on the same day of the month (including for 30/31 day months & leap years).This is what I came up with:Some time ago I wrote a format_date function as this gives many options on how you want your date:you can always use the following function that can return the age in years and months (ie. 1 Year 4 Months)or if you want the age to be calculated at the current date, you can useIn for a penny, in for a pound:\nI have just reviewed several solutions, all providing a complex solution using floor() that then rounds up to a 26 years 12 month and 2 days solution, for what should have been 25 years, 11 months and 20 days!!!!here is my version of this problem:\nmay not be elegant, may not be well coded, but provides a more closer proximity to a answer if you do not count LEAP years, obviously leap years could be coded into this, but in this case - as someone else said, perhaps you could provide this answer::\nI have included all TEST conditions and print_r so that you can see more clearly the construct of the results::\nhere goes,// set your input dates/ variables::// We need to EXPLODE the ISO yyyy-mm-dd format into yyyy mm dd, as follows::$yDate[ ] = explode(\'-\', $ISOstartDate);\n    print_r ($yDate);$zDate[ ] = explode(\'-\', $ISOtodaysDate);\n    print_r ($zDate);the end result is::\n26 years, 0 months, 0 daysThat\'s how long I have been in business for on the 22nd June 2013 - Ouch!
