In TypeScript I can declare a parameter of a function as a type Function. Is there a "type-safe" way of doing this that I am missing? For example, consider this:The save callback is not type safe, I am giving it a callback function where the function\'s parameter is a string but I am passing it a number, and compiles with no errors. Can I make the result parameter in save a type-safe function?tl;dr version: is there an equivalent of a .NET delegate in TypeScript?Sure:If you want, you can define a type to encapsulate this:Here are TypeScript equivalents of some common .NET delegates:I realize this post is old, but there\'s a more compact approach that is slightly different than what was asked, but may be a very helpful alternative. You can essentially declare the function in-line when calling the method (Foo\'s save() in this case). It would look something like this:The multipleCallback() approach is very useful for things like network calls that may succeed or fail. Again assuming a network call example, when multipleCallbacks() is called, behavior for both a success and failure can be defined in one spot, which lends itself to greater clarity for future code readers.Generally, in my experience, this approach lends itself to being more concise, less clutter, and greater clarity overall.Good luck all!This surely aligns with the functional programming paradigm.
