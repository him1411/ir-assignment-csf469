In Android, I want to use a Spinner that initially (when the user has not made a selection yet) displays the text "Select One". When the user clicks the spinner, the list of items is displayed and the user selects one of the options. After the user has made a selection, the selected item is displayed in the Spinner instead of "Select One".I have the following code to create a Spinner: With this code, initially the item "One" is displayed. I could just add a new item "Select One" to the items, but then "Select One" would also be displayed in the dropdown list as first item, which is not what I want.How can I fix this problem?Here\'s a general solution that overrides the Spinner view. It overrides setAdapter() to set the initial position to -1, and proxies the supplied SpinnerAdapter to display the prompt string for position less than 0.This has been tested on Android 1.5 through 4.2, but buyer beware! Because this solution relies on reflection to call the private AdapterView.setNextSelectedPositionInt() and AdapterView.setSelectedPositionInt(), it\'s not guaranteed to work in future OS updates. It seems likely that it will, but it is by no means guaranteed.Normally I wouldn\'t condone something like this, but this question has been asked enough times and it seems like a reasonable enough request that I thought I would post my solution.What you can do is decorate your SpinnerAdapter with one that presents a \'Select Option...\' View initially for the Spinner to display with nothing selected.Here is a working example tested for Android 2.3, and 4.0 (it uses nothing in the compatibility library, so it should be fine for awhile) Since it\'s a decorator, it should be easy to retrofit existing code and it works fine with CursorLoaders also. (Swap cursor on the wrapped cursorAdapter of course...)There is an Android bug that makes this a little tougher to re-use views. (So you have to use the setTag or something else to ensure your convertView is correct.) Spinner does not support multiple view typesCode notes: 2 constructorsThis allows you to use a standard prompt or define your own \'nothing selected\' as the first row, or both, or none. (Note: Some themes show a DropDown for a Spinner instead of a dialog. The Dropdown doesn\'t normally show the prompt)You define a layout to \'look\' like a prompt, for example, grayed out...Using a standard prompt (notice that nothing is selected):Or with a prompt and something dynamic (could have had no prompt also):Usage in above examplecontact_spinner_row_nothing_selected.xmlNothingSelectedSpinnerAdapter.javaI ended up using a Button instead. While a Button is not a Spinner, the behavior is easy to customize.First create the Adapter as usual:Note that I am using the simple_spinner_dropdown_item as the layout id. This will help create a better look when creating the alert dialog.In the onClick handler for my Button I have:And that\'s it!I know this question has lot of Answer but I found the simplest and easiest way to do.This solution is independent of API level ,it will works for all API level.Idea is  to set the last item of spinner as default one..ie Item at last index should be your Title of spinner like "Select Country"And while populating the spinner decrease the count of item by one.i.e\n//Count starts from 1 to total item.So your code flow will be like thisHintAdapter.javaSpinner Title\n\nSpinner Item\nEDIT: TypoFirst, you might be interested in the prompt attribute of the Spinner class. See the picture below, "Choose a Planet" is the prompt that can be set in the XML with  android:prompt="".I was going to suggest subclassing Spinner, where you could maintain two adapters internally. One adapter that has the "Select One" option, and the other real adapter (with the actual options), then using the OnClickListener to switch the adapters before the choices dialog is shown. However, after trying implement that idea I\'ve come to the conclusion you cannot receive OnClick events for the widget itself.You could wrap the spinner in a different view, intercept the clicks on the view, and then tell your CustomSpinner to switch the adapter, but seems like an awful hack.Do you really need to show "Select One"? This code has been tested and works on Android 4.4I found this solution:Just change the array[0] with "Select One" and then in the onItemSelected, rename it to "One".Not a classy solution, but it works :DThere is no default API to set hint on Spinner. To add it we need a small workaround with out that not safety reflection implementationAdapter source: Original sourceI got the same problem for spinner, with an empty selection, and I found a better solution. Have a look at this simple code.Here spinneradapter is a small customization for arrayadapter. It looks like this:XML file:    Activity:onCreate:Some function (add things to the adapter programmatically)>Now you have an empty spinner and you can write code to not open the dialog if empty. Or they can press back. But you also populate it with a function or another list during run time.Lots of answers here but I\'m surprised no one suggested a simple solution: Place a TextView on top of the Spinner.  Set a click listener on the TextView which hides the TextView shows the Spinner, and calls spinner.performClick().I have tried like the following. Take a button and give the click event to it. By changing the button background, it seems to be a spinner.Declare as global variables alertdialog and default value..You can change it to a Text View and use this:and then define the android:text property.Take a look at the iosched app for a general purpose solution to adding an element to the top of a list.  In particular, if you are using a CursorAdapter, look at TracksAdapter.java which extends that definition to provide a "setHasAllItem" method and associated code to manage the list count to deal with the extra item at the top.Using the custom adapter you can set the text to "Select One" or whatever else you may want that top item to say.I have a spinner on my main.xml and its id is @+id/spinner1this is what i write in my OnCreate function :It doesn\'t need any implementation in the class.I think the easiest way is creating a dummy item on index 0 saying "select one" and then on saving maybe check that selection is not 0.So this is my final example "all-in" for a button-spinnerIn activity_my_form.xmlIn strings.xmlIn MyFormActivity.javaFinally I obtained a font size configurable no first item selectable button spinner!!!\nThanks to HRJI found many good solutions for this. most is working by adding an item to the end of adapter, and don\'t display the last item in drop-down list.\nThe big problem for me was the spinner drop-down list will start from the bottom of the list. So user see the last items instead of the first items (in case of have many items to show), after touch the spinner for the first time.So I put the hint item to the beginning of the list. and hide the first item in drop-down list.set the below layout in @Override getDropDownView() when position is 0, to hide the first hint row.R.layout.spinner_hint_list_item_layout:When extending SpinnerAdapter, you override two View-producing methods, getView(int, View, ViewGroup) and getDropDownView(int, View, ViewGroup).  The first one supplies the View inserted into the Spinner itself; the second supplies the View in the drop-down list (as the name suggests).  You can override the getView(...) so that, until an item has been selected, it displays a TextView containing a prompt; then, when you detect an item has been selected, you change it to display a TextView corresponding to that.I\'d just use a RadioGroup with RadioButtons if you only have three choices, you can make them all unchecked at first.None of the previously submitted answers really worked the way I wanted to solve this issue. To me the ideal solution would provide the \xe2\x80\x9cSelect One\xe2\x80\x9d  (or whatever initial text) when the spinner is first displayed. When the user taps the spinner, the initial text shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a part of the drop down that is displayed.To further complicate my particular situation, my spinner data is coming form a cursor that is loaded via the LoaderManager callbacks.After considerable experimentation I came up with the following solution:I handle this by using a button instead of a Spinner.   I have the sample project up on GitHub.In the project, i\'m displaying both the Spinner and button to show that they indeed look identical.  Except the button you can set the initial text to whatever you want.  Here\'s what the activity looks like:NOTE:  Yes, I realize that this is dependent on the applied Theme and the look will be slightly different if using Theme.Holo.  However, if you\'re using one of the legacy themes such as Theme.Black, you\'re good to go.if you are facing this issue when your items are populates from database-cursor,the simplest solution that I found in this SO answer:use UNION in your cursor adapter query and add the additional item with id= -1 to the query result, without really adding it to the DB:something like:db.rawQuery("SELECT iWorkerId as _id, nvLastName as name  FROM  Worker\n  w  UNION  SELECT -1 as _id , \'\' as name",null);if the item selected is -1, then it\'s the default value. Otherwise\n it\'s a record from the table.Seems a banal solution but I usually put simply a TextView in the front of the spinner. The whole Xml looks like this. (hey guys, don\'t shoot me, I know that some of you don\'t like this kind of marriage):Then I hide the TextView when an Item was selected. Obviously the background color of the TextView should be the same as the Spinner. Works on Android 4.0. Don\'t know on older versions.Yes. Because the Spinner calls setOnItemSelectedListener at the beginning, the hiding of the textview could be a little bit tricky, but can be done this way:for me it worked something like this. has the improvement that only changes the text in SOME options, not in all.First i take the names of the spinner and create the arrayadapter with a customize view, but it doesn\'t matter now, the key is override the getView, and inside change the values u need to change. In my case was only the first one, the rest i leave the originalThis is my way:here\'s a simple oneRefer to one of the above answers: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23005376/1312796I added my code to fix a little bug. That where no data retrieved..How to show the prompt text..! Here is my Trick...It works fine with me. ! Try to put your spinner in a Relative_layoutand align a Textview with your spinner and play with the visibility of the Textview (SHOW/HIDE) whenever the adapter of the spinner loaded or empty..Like this: \n\nHere is the code:call this method after and before spinner adapter loaded and empty. to make it easy just like this:For those using Xamarin, here is the C# equivalent to aaronvargas\'s answer above.
