I would extract all the numbers contained in a string. Which is the better suited for the purpose, regular expressions or the isdigit() method?Example:Result:If you only want to extract only positive integers, try the following:I would argue that this is better than the regex example for three reasons.  First,  you don\'t need another module; secondly, it\'s more readable because you don\'t need to parse the regex mini-language; and third, it is faster (and thus likely more pythonic):This will not recognize floats, negative integers, or integers in hexadecimal format.  If you can\'t accept these limitations, slim\'s answer below will do the trick.I\'d use a regexp :This would also match 42 from bla42bla. If you only want numbers delimited by word boundaries (space, period, comma), you can use \\b :To end up with a list of numbers instead of a list of strings:This is more than a bit late, but you can extend the regex expression to account for scientific notation too.Gives all good!I\'m assuming you want floats not just integers so I\'d do something like this:Note that some of the other solutions posted here don\'t work with negative numbers:If you know it will be only one number in the string, i.e \'hello 12 hi\', you can try filter.For example:But be carefull !!! :This answer also contains the case when the number is float in the stringI am amazed to see that no one has yet mentioned the usage of itertools.groupby as an alternative to achieve this.You may use itertools.groupby() along with str.isdigit() in order to extract numbers from string as:The value hold by l will be:Since none of these dealt with real world financial numbers in excel and word docs that I needed to find, here is my variation. It handles ints, floats, negative numbers, currency numbers (because it doesn\'t reply on split), and has the option to drop the decimal part and just return ints, or return everything. It also handles Indian Laks number system where commas appear irregularly, not every 3 numbers apart.It does not handle scientific notation or negative numbers put inside parentheses in budgets -- will appear positive. It also does not extract dates. There are better ways for finding dates in strings.@jmnas, I liked your answer, but it didn\'t find floats.  I\'m working on a script to parse code going to a CNC mill and needed to find both X and Y dimensions that can be integers or floats, so I adapted your code to the following.  This finds int, float with positive and negative vals.  Still doesn\'t find hex formatted values but you could add "x" and "A" through "F" to the num_char tuple and I think it would parse things like \'0x23AC\'.the best option I found is below. it will extract number and can eliminate any type of char.
