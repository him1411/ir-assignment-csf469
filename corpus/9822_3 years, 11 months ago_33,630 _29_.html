One of Xcode 5\'s new features is the ability to document your own code with a special comment syntax. The format is similar to Doxygen, but appears to only support a subset of those features.Which commands are supported, and which ones aren\'t?\nDo any of their usages differ from Doxygen?Here is an example of all the options I have found as of Xcode 5.0.2That was generated with this code:Notes: This will show the brief text (with no formatting); if no brief text exists, it will show a concatenation of all the text up to the first @block; if none exists (e.g. you begin with @return), then it will concat all the text striping away all @commands.(See first screenshot.)Since the commands in Xcode 5 are compatible with Doxygen, you could download and use Doxygen to generate documentation files.For a general introduction to Doxygen and how to document Objective-C code, this page seems like a good resource.Descriptions of some of the supported commands:The following don\'t work:The following are not supported (they don\'t even appear in dark green):Apple uses what appears to be reserved keywords that only works in their documentation. Although they appear in dark green, it looks like we cannot use them as Apple does. You can see examples of Apple\'s usage in files such as AVCaptureOutput.h. Here is a list of some of those keywords:At best, the keyword will cause a new line in the Description field (e.g. @discussion). At worst, the keyword and any text following it will not appear in the quick help (e.g. @class).Swift 2.0 uses the following syntax:Notice how @param is now - parameter.You can also now include bullets in your documentation:Senseful:You may need to build your project before the latest changes to your documentation appear.Sometimes this hasn\'t been enough for me. Closing Xcode and opening the project back up usually remedies those cases.I\'m also getting different results in .h files and .m files. I can\'t get new lines when the documentation comments are in a header file.Most of the formatting has changed for Swift 2.0 (as of Xcode7 \xc3\x9f3, also true in \xc3\x9f4)instead of :param: thing description of thing\n(as it was in Swift 1.2) it is now - parameter thing: description of thingMost of the keywords have been replaced by - [keyword]: [description] instead of :[keyword]: [description]. Currently the list of keywords that don\'t work includes, abstract, discussion, brief, pre, post, sa, see, availability, class, deprecated, method, property, protocol, related, ref.
