How to calculate minute difference between two date-times in PHP?Subtract the past most one from the future most one and divide by 60. Times are done in Unix format so they\'re just a big number showing the number of seconds from January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMTHere is the answer:The answers above are for older versions of PHP. Use the DateTime class to do any date calculations now that PHP 5.3 is the norm.\nEg.$since_start is a DateInterval object. Note that the days property is available (because we used the diff method of the DateTime class to generate the DateInterval object).The above code will output:1837 days total5 years0 months10 days6 hours14 minutes2 secondsTo get the total number of minutes:This will output:2645654 minutesWhich is the actual number of minutes that has passed between the two dates. The DateTime class will take daylight saving (depending on timezone) into account where the "old way" won\'t. Read the manual about Date and Time http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.datetime.phpIt worked on my programs, i\'am using date_diff, you can check date_diff manual on here.You get results what do you want.I think this will help you another way with timezone.   I wrote this function for one my blog site(difference between a past date and server\'s date). It will give you an output like this"49 seconds ago", "20 minutes ago", "21 hours ago" and so onyou can find the source code and live demo here.I have used a function that would get me the difference between the date passed and the server\'s date.Save it as a file suppose "date.php". Call the function from another page like thisOf course you can modify the function to pass two values.This is how I displayed "xx times ago" in php > 5.2 .. here is more info on DateTime object A more universal version that returns result in days, hours, minutes or seconds including fractions/decimals:
