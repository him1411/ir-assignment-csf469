Is there a simple, one-line way to get the data of a form as it would be if it was to be submitted in the classic HTML-only way?For example, in:Out:Something like this is too simple, since it does not (correctly) include textareas, selects, radio buttons and checkboxes:demoUse $(\'form\').serializeArray(), which returns an array:Other option is $(\'form\').serialize(), which returns a string:Take a look at this jsfiddle demoBased on jQuery.serializeArray, returns key-value pairs.Updated answer for 2014: HTML5 FormData does thisYou can then post formData exactly as it is - it contains all names and values used in the form.use .serializeArray() to get the data in array format and then convert it into an object:Here\'s a really simple and short soluton that even doesn\'t require Jquery.other than that, you might want to look at serialize();Here is a working JavaScript only implementation which correctly handles checkboxes, radio buttons, and sliders (probably other input types as well, but I\'ve only tested these).If you\'re looking for a more complete implementation, then take a look at this section of the project I made this for. I\'ll update this question eventually with the complete solution I came up with, but maybe this will be helpful to someone.I use this:jQuery PluginHTML FormGet the DataIf you are using jQuery, here is a little function that will do what you are looking for.First, add an ID to your form (unless it is the only form on the page, then you can just use \'form\' as the dom query)The output would look like:You are all not fully correct. You cannot write:Because this way if you have multiselect list - its values will be overwritten with the last one, since it\'s transmitted as: "param1" : "value1", "param1" : "value2".So, correct approach is:I wrote a library to solve this very problem: JSONForms. It takes a form, goes through each input and builds a JSON object you can easily read.Say you have the following form:Passing the form to JSONForms\' encode method returns you the following object:Here\'s demo with your form.I wrote a function that takes care of multiple checkboxes and multiple selects. In those cases it returns an array.you can use this function for have an object or a JSON from form.for use it:showing form input element fields and input file to submit your form without page refresh and grab all values with file include in it here it is You can also use the FormData Objects; The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using XMLHttpRequest. Its primarily intended for use in sending form data, but can be used independently from forms in order to transmit keyed data.This method should do it. It serializes the form data and then converts them to an object. Takes care of groups of checkboxes as well.Here is a nice vanilla JS function I wrote to extract form data as an object. It also has options for inserting additions into the object, and for clearing the form input fields.Here is an example of its use with a post request:It will fix issue:couldn\'t work with multiselects.This is a nitpicky answer, but let me explain why this is a better solution:We\'re properly handling a form submit rather than a button press.  Some people like to push enter on fields.  Some people use alternative input devices such as speech input or other accessibility devices.  Handle the form submit and you correctly solve it for everyone.We\'re digging into the form data for the actual form that was submitted.  If you change your form selector later, you don\'t have to change the selectors for all the fields.  Furthermore, you might have several forms with the same input names.  No need to disambiguate with excessive IDs and what not, just track the inputs based on the form that was submitted.  This also enables you to use a single event handler for multiple forms if that is appropriate for your situation.The FormData interface is fairly new, but is well supported by browsers.  It\'s a great way to build that data collection to get the real values of what\'s in the form.  Without it, you\'re going to have to loop through all the elements (such as with form.elements) and figure out what\'s checked, what isn\'t, what the values are, etc.  Totally possible if you need old browser support, but the FormData interface is simpler.I\'m using ES6 here... not a requirement by any means, so change it back to be ES5 compatible if you need old browser support.This will append all form fields to the JavaScript object "res":
