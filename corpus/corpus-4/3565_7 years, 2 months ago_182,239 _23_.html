I am using eclipse on my project and while messing around with my eclipse settings, I turned on Javascript support. Now eclipse complains that JQuery library has errors in it and is not letting me compile the project. Does anyone know how to turn javascript validation off? I actually like MY JavaScript files to be validated, but I definitely don\'t want to validate and deal with trivial warnings with third party libraries.That\'s why I think that turning off validation all together is too drastic.  Fortunately with Eclipse, you can selectively remove some JavaScript sources from validation.The information about JavaScript source inclusion/exclusion is saved into .settings/.jsdtscope file.  Do not forget to add it to your SCM.Here is how configuration looks with jQuery files removed from validation:Turn off the JavaScript Validator in the "Builders" config for your project:Then either restart your Eclipse or/and rename the .js to something like .js_ then back again.I removed the tag in the .project .It\'s worked very well for me. Window -> Preferences -> JavaScript -> Validator (also per project settings possible)orWindow -> Preferences -> Validation (disable validations and configure their settings)I was able to exclude the jquery.mobile 1.1.1 in Juno by selecting Add Multiple next to the Exlusion Patterns, which brings up the tree, then drilling down to the jquery-mobile folder and selecting that.This corrected all the warnings for the library!Go to Windows->Preferences->Validation.  There would be a list of validators with checkbox options for Manual & Build, go and individually disable the javascript validator there. If you select the Suspend All Validators checkbox on the top it doesn\'t necessarily take affect.Another reason could be that you acidentically added a Javascript nature to your project unintentionally (i just did this by accident) which enables javascript error checking.removing this ....javascriptnature from your project fixes that.(this is ofcourse only if you dont want eclipse to realise you have any JS)In addition, if you are using Tern eclipse IDE or IBM Node.js Tools for Eclipse, you may need to disable JSHint and other libraries that you don\'t want. To disable this, Project Properties > Tern > Modules > JSHint or any other library that you don\'t want.\n
