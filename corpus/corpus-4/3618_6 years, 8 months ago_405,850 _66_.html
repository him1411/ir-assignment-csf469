I guess most of you, developers, use any VCS, and I hope some of you use Git. Do you have any tip or trick how to get a download URL for a single file in a repository?I don\'t want the URL for displaying the raw file; in case of binaries it\'s for nothing.http://support.github.com/discussions/feature-requests/41-download-single-fileIs it even possible to use GitHub as a "download server"?If we decide to switch to Google Code, is the mentioned functionality presented here?Or is there any free-of-charge hosting and VCS for open-source projects?Git does not support downloading parts of the repository. You have to download all of it. But you should be able to do this with GitHub.When you view a file it has a link to the "raw" version. The URL is constructed like soBy filling in the blanks in the URL, you can use Wget or cURL or whatever to download a single file. Again, you won\'t get any of the nice version control features used by Git by doing this.Update: I noticed you mention this doesn\'t work for binary files. You probably shouldn\'t use binary files in your Git repository, but GitHub has a download section for each repository that you can use to upload files.  If you need more than one binary, you can use a .zip file.\nThe URL to download an uploaded file is:You can use the V3 API to get a raw file like this (you\'ll need an OAuth token):curl -H \'Authorization: token INSERTACCESSTOKENHERE\' -H \'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw\' -O -L https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo/contents/pathAll of this has to go on one line. The -O option saves the file in the current directory. You can use -o filename to specify a different filename.To get the OAuth token follow the instructions here:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-useI\'ve written this up as a gist as well:\nhttps://gist.github.com/madrobby/9476733GitHub Mate makes single file download effortless, just click the icon to download, currently it only work on Chrome.This is now possible in GitHub for any file. You need to translate your files for raw.github.com. For example, if your file is in your repository at:Using wget you can grab the raw file from:Rails Composer is a great example of this.To follow up with what thomasfuchs said but instead for GitHub Enterprise users here\'s what you can use.curl -H \'Authorization: token INSERTACCESSTOKENHERE\' -H \'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw\' -O -L https://your_domain/api/v3/repos/owner/repo/contents/pathAlso here\'s the API documentation https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contentsIn case you want to download a zip file from github using wgetsee this website for more detailsThis method works for Windows as I have never used MAC so I don\'t know what are the alternate keys in MAC for the keys which I\'m going to mention below. Let\'s talk about the CSV files. IF you want to download the CSV file:Remeber, you have to press Alt and left click simultaneously. Just clicking the "Raw" button will open up the CSV in the browser.I hope that helps.According to this gist, you can use wget or cURL: The page you linked to answers the first question.GitHub also has a download facility for things like releases.Google Code does not have Git at all.GitHub, Google Code and SourceForge, just to start, are free hosting. SourceForge might still do CVS.You should just do it with the raw URL of your file.For example to download the README of AFNetworking:As it is a public repo you don\'t need any credentials.\nPlease note the kind of url: raw.githubusercontent.com/path/to/fileThis would definitely work. At least in Chrome. Right click on the "Raw" icon -> Save Link As.I think the new url structure is raw.giturl for example:git filerawIf you happen to use curl and firefox... you could use the cliget add-on which generates a curl call including all authentication mechanisms (aka cookies). So right click on the raw button cliget->"copy url for link" and then paste that into a shell. You will get your file even if you had to log-in to see it.I recently found a service called gitzip and its also open source:site - http://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/repo - https://github.com/KinoLien/gitzipVist the above site, enter the repo or directory URL, you can download individual files or whole directory as a zip file.Rather than link to download a specific file within the repo, you should use GitHub\'s Releases feature to associate downloadable data (such as compiled binaries) with the tagged version of the source code used to generate that data.  https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-softwareWe\'re excited to announce Releases, a workflow for shipping software to end users. Releases are first-class objects with changelogs and binary assets that present a full project history beyond Git artifacts.Releases are accompanied by release notes and links to download the software or source code.Following the conventions of many Git projects, releases are tied to Git tags. You can use an existing tag, or let releases create the tag when it\'s published.For users with GitHub Enterprise you need to construct URL in following scheme Invoke-WebRequest http://github.mycompany.com/api/v3/repos/my-org/my-repo/contents/myfiles/file.txt -Headers @{"Authorization"="token 8d795936d2c1b2806587719b9b6456bd16549ad8"}Details can be found herehttp://artisticcheese.blogspot.com/2017/04/how-to-download-individual-files-from.htmlNow it\'s possible to download any file or any particular folder within the repository using this google chrome extention:GitZip for github  :\nlink : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitzip-for-github/ffabmkklhbepgcgfonabamgnfafbdlknThis is what worked for me just now...Open the raw file in a seperate tab.Copy the whole thing in your notepad in a new file.Save the file in the extension it originally had...worked for the .php file I DL just now.
