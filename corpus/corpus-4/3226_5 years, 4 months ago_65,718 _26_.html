I tried to run brew update and I get an error about my local changes would be lost if I merged.  I tried committing my local changes (don\'t remember making any, but it\'s been awhile), and that made things worse.Here\'s the output:Don\'t forget to fetch the origin!!!$ cd /usr/local\n$ git fetch origin\n$ git reset --hard origin/masterExplanation, for those interested:What happens is that you are trying to update brew, but brew itself is either not up to date (likely), there is a permissions change via some OS update (also likely), or brew is slightly corrupt (unlikely).  Since brew itself is a git repo, you have to update or reset brew to the master branch version.   brew [by default] is located in the /usr/local folder, so you  You can also chown the first command if you are in a non sudo or admin profile\n$ sudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local\n$ cd /usr/local\n$ git reset --hard origin/master To understand git reset, take a look at this article.I had a similar issue a couple weeks ago trying to update an old homebrew install. Doing this:in /usr/local fixed it for me.It seems like other folks have had this issue too.  Have you looked over any of the proposed workarounds here? I\'m adding my personal experience, since it seems a little safer than what proposed in 2012:If you get the following warning:run:to fix the permissions problems (as suggested also by Chris Frisina). Eventually run brew doctor again to ensure yourself that the warning is gone.Now, you should have athat may bey solved byas suggested by Dr.Brew itself. The command stashes the uncommitted modifications so you could go back and recover them if needed. It seemed safer than git reset --hard origin/master to me.If you wish, check the official troubleshooting guide if the steps suggested here and by other SO users does not solve your problem.Similar answer but if you have files that are no longer tracked you need additional step so from /usr/local runThis approach may be simpler than some. It involves:Steps (with notes for those who want explanations):Overview:\nFrom what I can tell, the actual cause of this issue is a change in the repo url. It\'s now brew and was brew.git. (Full up-to-date url: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew)  Note 1: This first command takes you from anywhere in your file structure to the correct directory. The directory structure is different for me than what others show above (Mac OS 10.11.16), but with this command, those differences should not matter.  Note 2: This second command adds the correct remote url to a new alias; I did so just in case this approach didn\'t accomplish what I wanted and I needed the previous address again. Since the new remote worked, I\'ll invite someone else to comment on simply changing the url aliased by origin. I\'ll happily update the answer to reflect what worked for you.  Note 3: This forth command has exactly the desired result: it reports a large number of updates, including the particularly nice report of "==> Migrated HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY to /usr/local/Homebrew!" (emphasis theirs).
