Is there a PHP function that returns the date & time in the same format as the MySQL function NOW()? I know how to do it using date(), but I am asking if there is a function only for this. For example to return:Not besides date("Y-m-d H:i:s")date(\'Y-m-d H:i:s\')Look here for more details: http://pl.php.net/manual/en/function.date.phpWith PHP version >= 5.4 DateTime can do this:-See it working.Use this function:Try this: date("Y-m-d H:i:s"); I was looking for the same answer, and I have come up with this solution for PHP 5.3 or later:Use strftime:%F is the same as %Y-%m-%d.%T is the same as %H:%M:%S.Here\'s a demo on ideone.MySQL function NOW() returns the current timestamp. The only way I found for PHP is using the following code.One more answer I find easy to use:This is ISO 8601 date (added in PHP 5) which MySQL usesI would like to add one answer to the answerlist. You can use date_create(), which creates a dateTime object. The function date_create() supports the use of a relative format in it\'s parameter, which makes the code readable. Then you can return your date by invoking the format() method. Works on php 5.2 and higherCode: I use this approach for my projects if I have to fill an array. Like this:I like the solution posted by user1786647, I\'ve updated it a little to change the timezone to a function argument and add optional support for passing either a Unix time or datetime string to use for the returned datestamp.Also includes a fall back for "setTimestamp" for users running version lower than PHP 5.3:You can use simplePHP class to do this:This class also provides many useful methods for date addition, subtraction and comparison. You can check the tutorials page for more examples.
