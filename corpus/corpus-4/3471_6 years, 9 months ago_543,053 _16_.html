I am learning how to create UI elements. I have created a few EditText input fields. On the click of a Button I want to capture the content typed into that input field.That\'s my field. How can I get the content?By using getText():I guess you will have to use this code when calling the "mEdit" your EditText object :myActivity.this.mEdit.getText().toString()Just make sure that the compiler know which EditText to call and use.I hope this one should work:I tried Integer.getInteger() method instead of valueOf() - it didn\'t work. Get value from an EditText control in android. EditText getText property use to get value an EditText:You might also want to take a look at Butter Knife. It aims at reducing the amount of boilerplate code by using annotation. Here is a simple example:Just add the following dependency to your build.gradle:As an alternative there is also AndroidAnnotations.A more advanced way would be to use butterknife bindview. This eliminates redundant code.In your gradle under dependencies; add this 2 lines.Then sync up.\nExample binding edittext in MainActivity But this is an alternative once you feel more comfortable or starting to work with lots of data.
