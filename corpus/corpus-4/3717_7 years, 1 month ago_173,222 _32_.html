I\'m doing development on MongoDB. For totally non-evil purposes, I sometimes want to blow away everything in a database\xe2\x80\x94that is, to delete every single collection, and whatever else might be lying around, and start from scratch. Is there a single line of code that will let me do this? Bonus points for giving both a MongoDB console method and a MongoDB Ruby driver method.In the mongo shell:Ruby code is pretty similar.Also, from the command line:I had the same problem, when I needed to reset all the collections but didn\'t want to loose any database users. Use the following line of code, if you would like to save the user configuration for the database:This code will go through all collection names from one database and drop those which do not start with "system.".I followed the db.dropDatabase() route for a long time, however if you\'re trying to use this for wiping the database in between test cases you may eventually find problems with index constraints not being honored after the database drop. As a result, you\'ll either need to mess about with ensureIndexes, or a simpler route would be avoiding the dropDatabase alltogether and just removing from each collection in a loop such as:In my case I was running this from the command-line using:By compiling answers from @Robse and @DanH (kudos!), I\'ve got the following solution which completely satisfies me:Connect to you database, run the code.  It cleans the database by dropping the user collections and emptying the system collections.Use Hear are some use full delete operations for mongodb using mongo shellTo delete particular document in collections: db.mycollection.remove( {name:"stack"} )To delete all documents in collections:  db.mycollection.remove()To delete collection :  db.mycollection.drop()to delete database :\nfirst go to that database by use mydb command and then if you want to delete only a database and its sub-collections use this :if you want to delete all the databases in mongo then use this :Simplest way to delete a database say blog:For Meteor developers.Open a second terminal window while running your app in localhost:3000.In your project\'s folder run, meteor mongo.coolName = new Mongo.Collection(\'yourCollectionName\');Then simply enter db.yourCollectionName.drop();You\'ll automatically see the changes in your local server.For everybody else.db.yourCollectionName.drop();To delete all DBs use:MongoDB db.dropDatabase() documentation explaining the modification introduced in 2.6:Changed in version 2.6: This command does not delete the users associated with the current database.Hope that helps
