Are there any crucial differences between Oracle and Open JDK? For example are the garbage collection and other JVM parameters the same?Does GC work differently between the two?Both openjdk and oracle jdk are created and maintained currently by Oracle only.openjdk and oracle jdk are implementations of same Java specification passed the TCK(Java Technology Certification Kit).Most of the vendors of JDK are written on top of openjdk by doing few tweaks  to [Mostly to replace licensed proprietary parts / replace with more performant items that only work on specific OS] components without breaking the TCK compatibility.Many vendors implemented Java specification and got TCK passed. For example IBM J9 , Azul Zulu , Azul Zing , Oracle JDK.Almost every existing JDK is derived from openjdk.As suggested by many, licensing is a change between JDK\'s.Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_virtual_machines#Proprietary_implementationsNothing crucial. The openjdk project is mostly based on hotspot source code donated by Sun.Moreover, openjdk was selected to be the reference implementation for java 7, and is maintained by Oracle engineers.There\'s a more detailed answer to your question here, which links to this blog post:Q: What is the difference between the source code found in the OpenJDK\n  repository, and the code you use to build the Oracle JDK?A: It is very close - our build process for Oracle JDK releases builds \n  on OpenJDK 7 by adding just a couple of pieces, like the deployment code,\n  which includes Oracle\'s implementation of the Java Plugin and Java\n  WebStart, as well as some closed source third party components like a\n  graphics rasterizer, some open source third party components, like\n  Rhino, and a few bits and pieces here and there, like additional\n  documentation or third party fonts. Moving forward, our intent is to\n  open source all pieces of the Oracle JDK except those that we consider\n  commercial features such as JRockit Mission Control (not yet available\n  in Oracle JDK), and replace encumbered third party components with\n  open source alternatives to achieve closer parity between the code\n  bases.Oracle JDK vs OpenJDK-OpenJDK is an open source implementation of the Java Standard Edition platform with contribution from Oracle and open Java community.-OpenJDK is released under license GPL v2 wherein Oracle JDK is licensed under Oracle Binary Code License Agreement.source :- http://javapapers.com/java/oracle-jdk-vs-openjdk-and-java-jdk-development-process/
