When a PHP application makes a database connection it of course generally needs to pass a login and password. If I\'m using a single, minimum-permission login for my application, then the PHP needs to know that login and password somewhere. What is the best way to secure that password? It seems like just writing it in the PHP code isn\'t a good idea.Several people misread this as a question about how to store passwords in a database.  That is wrong.  It is about how to store the password that lets you get to the database.The usual solution is to move the password out of source-code into a configuration file.  Then leave administration and securing that configuration file up to your system administrators.  That way developers do not need to know anything about the production passwords, and there is no record of the password in your source-control.If you\'re hosting on someone else\'s server and don\'t have access outside your webroot, you can always put your password and/or database connection in a file and then lock the file using a .htaccess:Store them in a file outside web root.For extremely secure systems we encrypt the database password in a configuration file (which itself is secured by the system administrator). On application/server startup the application then prompts the system administrator for the decryption key. The database password is then read from the config file, decrypted, and stored in memory for future use. Still not 100% secure since it is stored in memory decrypted, but you have to call it \'secure enough\' at some point!The most secure way is to not have the information specified in your PHP code at all.If you\'re using Apache that means to set the connection details in your httpd.conf or virtual hosts file file. If you do that you can call mysql_connect() with no parameters, which means PHP will never ever output your information.This is how you specify these values in those files:Then you open your mysql connection like this:Or like this:This solution is general, in that it is useful for both open and closed source applications.Advantages:This method is suggested by Heroku, who are very successful. if it is possible to create the database connection in the same file where the credentials are stored. Inline the credentials in the connect statement.Otherwise it is best to unset the credentials after the connect statement, because credentials that are not in memory, can\'t be read from memory ;)Your choices are kind of limited as as you say you need the password to access the database. One general approach is to store the username and password in a seperate configuration file rather than the main script. Then be sure to store that outside the main web tree. That was if there is a web configuration problem that leaves your php files being simply displayed as text rather than being executed you haven\'t exposed the password.Other than that you are on the right lines with minimal access for the account being used. Add to thatPeter If you are using PostgreSQL, then it looks in ~/.pgpass for passwords automatically.  See the manual for more information.Put the database password in a file, make it read-only to the user serving the files.Unless you have some means of only allowing the php server process to access the database, this is pretty much all you can do.If you\'re talking about the database password, as opposed to the password coming from a browser, the standard practice seems to be to put the database password in a PHP config file on the server.You just need to be sure that the php file containing the password has appropriate permissions on it. I.e. it should be readable only by the web server and by your user account.I think the OP means the database password.Unless someone gains access to your server via FTP or SSH (in which case you\'re already buggered), I wouldn\'t worry about storing passwords in plaintext in PHP files. Most PHP applications I\'ve seen do it that way, for example phpbb.Best way is to not store the password at all!\nFor instance, if you\'re on a Windows system, and connecting to SQL Server, you can use Integrated Authentication to connect to the database without a password, using the current process\'s identity.If you do need to connect with a password, first encrypt it, using strong encryption (e.g. using AES-256, and then protect the encryption key, or using asymmetric encryption and have the OS protect the cert), and then store it in a configuration file (outside of the web directory) with strong ACLs.An additional trick is to use a PHP separate configuration file that looks like that :This does not prevent you from setting access rules properly. But in the case your web site is hacked, a "require" or an "include" will just exit the script at the first line so it\'s even harder to get the data.Nevertheless, do not ever let configuration files in a directory that can be accessed through the web. You should have a "Web" folder containing your controler code, css, pictures and js. That\'s all. Anything else goes in offline folders.Just putting it into a config file somewhere is the way it\'s usually done. Just make sure you:Previously we stored DB user/pass in a configuration file, but have since hit paranoid mode -- adopting a policy of Defence in Depth.If your application is compromised, the user will have read access to your configuration file and so there is potential for a cracker to read this information.  Configuration files can also get caught up in version control, or copied around servers.We have switched to storing user/pass in environment variables set in the Apache VirtualHost. This configuration is only readable by root -- hopefully your Apache user is not running as root.The con with this is that now the password is in a Global PHP variable.To mitigate this risk we have the following precautions:We have solved it in this way:
