What are some open source programs that use Haskell and can be considered to be good quality modern Haskell? The larger the code base, the better.I want to learn from their source code. I feel I\'m past the point of learning from small code examples, which are often to esoteric and small-world. I want to see how code is structured, how monads interact when you have a lot of things going on (logging, I/O, configuration, etc.).What I recommend.Read code by people from different grad schools in the 1990sRead code by the old masters certain people (incomplete list)Note that people like me, Coutts, Mitchell, O\'Sullivan, Lynagh, etc. learned our Haskell style from these guys.Read some applicationsXMonad is an open source tiling window manager, originally loosely modeled on dwm.  There are a lot of extensions, of varying quality, but the core is compact and well organized.Darcs is an open source, source code management system. It should give you a nice idea for Haskell.Haskell: Functional Programming with TypesJoeri van Eekelen, et al. | Wikibooks\n   Published in 2007, 290 pagesLearn You a Haskell for Great Good!Miran Lipovaca | LearnYouaHaskell.com\n   Published in 2010, 176 pagesReal World HaskellB.

You will learn a lot from the persistence library that comes with it as well.If you care about Web-programming I would recommend Chris Done\'s lpaste project.GHC is probably the biggest or one of the biggest projects written in Haskell that is open source. When I say biggest, I do not just mean in terms of source size, but also impact, use, innovation, robustness. GHC can teach you a lot about writing Haskell.
