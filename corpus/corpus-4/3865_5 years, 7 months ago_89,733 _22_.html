There\'s a typo in my MongoDB database name and I\'m looking to rename the database.I can copy and delete like so...Is there a command to rename a database?No there isn\'t. See https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-701Unfortunately, this is not an simple feature for us to implement due to the way that database metadata is stored in the original (default) storage engine. In MMAPv1 files, the namespace (e.g.: dbName.collection) that describes every single collection and index includes the database name, so to rename a set of database files, every single namespace string would have to be rewritten. This impacts:This is just to accomplish a rename of a single database in a standalone mongod instance. For replica sets the above would need to be done on every replica node, plus on each node every single oplog entry that refers this database would have to be somehow invalidated or rewritten, and then if it\'s a sharded cluster, one also needs to add these changes to every shard if the DB is sharded, plus the config servers have all the shard metadata in terms of namespaces with their full names.There would be absolutely no way to do this on a live system.To do it offline, it would require re-writing every single database file to accommodate the new name, and at that point it would be as slow as the current "copydb" command...You could do this:Editorial Note: this is the same approach used in the question itself but has proven useful to others regardless.Alternative solution: you can dump your db and restore that in different name. As I\'ve experienced it\'s much quicker than db.copyDatabase().http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/backup-with-mongodump/The above process is slow,you can use below method but you need to move collection by collection to another db.ALERT : Hey folks just be careful while copying the database, if you don\'t want to mess up the different collections under single database.The following shows you how to renameTo rename you use the following syntaxExample:Now you can safely delete the old db by the following wayNow just think what happens if you try renaming the new database name with existing database nameExample:So in this context all the collections (tables) of testing will be copied to movies database.Hope it helped. Happy coding!
