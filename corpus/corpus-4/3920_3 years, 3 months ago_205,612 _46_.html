In Swift, how can I check if an element exists in an array? Xcode does not have any suggestions for contain, include, or has, and a quick search through the book turned up nothing. Any idea how to check for this? I know that there is a method find that returns the index number, but is there a method that returns a boolean like ruby\'s #include??Example of what I need:Swift 2, 3:contains() is a protocol extension method of SequenceType (for sequences of Equatable elements) and not a global method as in\nearlier releases.Remarks: Swift older versions: For those who came here looking for a find and deleteSwift 1Swift 2Swift 3Use this extension:Use as:Updated for Swift 2/3Note that as of Swift 3 (or even 2), the extension is no longer necessary as the global contains function has been made into a pair of extension method on Array, which allow you to do either of:If you are checking if an instance of a custom class or struct is contained in an array, you\'ll need to implement the Equatable protocol before you can use .contains(myObject).For example:then you can do:Tip: The == override should be at the global level, not within your class/structI used filter.If you want, you can compress that toHope that helps.Update for Swift 2Hurray for default implementations!(Swift 3)If the intent is:Then an alternative to contains(_:) as blueprinted Sequence is to first(where:) of Sequence:In this contrived example, its usage might seem silly, but it\'s very useful if querying arrays of non-fundamental element types for existence of any elements fulfilling some condition. E.g.Any chained operations using .filter { ... some condition }.first can favourably be replaced with first(where:). The latter shows intent better, and have performance advantages over possible non-lazy appliances of .filter, as these will pass the full array prior to extracting the (possible) first element passing the filter.A comment below queries:How can I remove the firstSuchElement from the array?A similar use case to the one above is to remove the first element that fulfils a given predicate. To do so, the index(where:) method of Collection (which is readily available to array collection) may be used to find the index of the first element fulfilling the predicate, whereafter the index can be used with the remove(at:) method of Array to (possible; given that it exists) remove that element.Or, if you\'d like to remove the element from the array and work with, apply Optional:s map(_:) method to conditionally (for .some(...) return from index(where:)) use the result from index(where:) to remove and capture the removed element from the array (within an optional binding clause).Note that in the contrived example above the array members are simple value types (String instances), so using a predicate to find a given member is somewhat over-kill, as we might simply test for equality using the simpler index(of:) method as shown in @DogCoffee\'s answer. If applying the find-and-remove approach above to the Person example, however, using index(where:) with a predicate is appropriate (since we no longer test for equality but for fulfilling a supplied predicate).The simplest way to accomplish this is to use filter on the array.result will have the found element if it exists and will be empty if the element does not exist. So simply checking if result is empty will tell you whether the element exists in the array. I would use the following:As of Swift 2.1 NSArrays have containsObjectthat can be used like so:Just in case anybody is trying to find if an indexPath is among the selected ones (like in a UICollectionView or UITableView cellForItemAtIndexPath functions):    Here is my little extension I just wrote to check if my delegate array contains a delegate object or not (Swift 2). :) It Also works with value types like a charm.If you have an idea how to optimize this code, than just let me know.Swift  If you are not using object then you can user this code for contains.If you are using NSObject Class in swift. This variables is according to my requirement. you can modify for your requirement. This is for a same data type.If you want to AnyObject type.Full condition if user find particular array elements  then use below  code same as integer value.
