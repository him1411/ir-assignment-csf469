If you can, you should stick withinstead to install over HTTPS.I\'m on Ubuntu. I used apt-get to install node. Npm was not included in that package, so it had to be installed separately. I assumed that would work, but apparently the npm version in the Ubuntu distribution was outdated.The node wiki has this instruction:Obtaining a recent version of Node or installing on older Ubuntu and other apt-based distributions may require a few extra steps. Example install:After that, npm was already included and worked perfectly.You also need to install software-properties-common for add-apt-repository to work.\nso it will beFor me, it\'s usually a proxy issue, and I try everything:One thing that has worked for me with random npm install errors (where the package that errors out is different under different times (but same environment) is to use this:npm cache cleanAnd then repeat the process. Then the process seems to go smoother and the real problem and error message will emerge, where you can fix it and then proceed.This is based on experience of running npm install of a whole bunch of packages under a pretty bare Ubuntu installation inside a Docker instance. Sometimes there are build/make tools missing from the Ubuntu and the npm errors will not show the real problem until you clean the cache for some reason.There are now official instructions from joyent (primary nodejs backer). For Ubuntu:For other unix distributions, osx and windows see the link.

You should verify where it lives:I also had to change the permissions to get it to work:If it didn\'t work check your path:Note that installing it this way, it will not be managed by apt-get package manager. Cheers!The below method worked for me, Kudos to github user : midnightcodrMake sure You remove any nodejs/npm packages already installed.Now Install Node js using the command below( Thanks to midnightcodr on github)Note that you can invoke node with command node and not nodejs.Once node is installed , Install npmRecently I had this problem after upgrading node.js (and inevitably npm) to the newest version:> npm --version\n< 2.0.0-alpha-5Note: I didn\'t ask for an unstable version, I just got it after brew install npm on OSX.Downgrading npm fixed the problem for me.The easiest way to install the stable npm is npm install -g npm but it might not work under some circumstances and downgrade of node.js might be needed then.It could be that the npm registry was down at the time or your connection dropped.Either way you should upgrade node and npm.

Following the steps in his answer, you will end up with Node version 0.10.25 - not the most recent version.You should still purge any existing node/npm packages withand then go and look at the nodesource deb install page at https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall.All Node.js versions are listed on the above page with the Linux commands to install them. And these packages will work on both Debian and Ubuntu.P.S. If you want to run Node v4.4 or higher on Ubuntu Precise or Debian Wheezy, you should review the information about running on older distros.P.P.S.
