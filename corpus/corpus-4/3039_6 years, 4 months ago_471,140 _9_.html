Is it possible to create a temporary (session only) table from a select statement without using a create table statement and specifying each column type? I know derived tables are capable of this, but those are super-temporary (statement-only) and I want to re-use.It would save time if I did not have to write up a create table command and keep the column list and type list matched up.From the manual found at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table.htmlYou can use the TEMPORARY keyword when creating a table. A TEMPORARY table is visible only to the current session, and is dropped automatically when the session is closed. This means that two different sessions can use the same temporary table name without conflicting with each other or with an existing non-TEMPORARY table of the same name. (The existing table is hidden until the temporary table is dropped.) To create temporary tables, you must have the CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES privilege.In addition to psparrow\'s answer if you need to add an index to your temporary table do:It also works with PRIMARY KEYUse this  syntax:Engine must be before select:ENGINE=MEMORY is not supported when table contains BLOB/TEXT columns
