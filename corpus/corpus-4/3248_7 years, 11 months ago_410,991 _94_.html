In Google Maps API v2, if I wanted to remove all the map markers, I could simply do:How do I do this in Google Maps API v3?Looking at the Reference API, it\'s unclear to me.Simply do the following:I. Declare a global variable:II. Define a function:ORIII. Push markers in the \'markerArray\' before calling the following:IV. Call the clearOverlays(); or map.clearOverlays(); function wherever required.That\'s it!!Same problem. This code doesn\'t work anymore.I\'ve corrected it, change clearMarkers method this way:set_map(null) ---> setMap(null)Documentation has been updated to include details on the topic: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers#removeIt seems that there is no such function in V3 yet.People suggest to keep references to all markers you have on the map in an array. And then when you want to delete em all, just loop trough the array and call .setMap(null) method on each of the references.See this question for more info/code.My version:The code is edited version of this code http://www.lootogo.com/googlemapsapi3/markerPlugin.html I removed the need to call addMarker  manually.ProsConsI don\'t think there is one in V3 so I used the above custom implementation.Disclaimer:  I did not write this code but I forgot to retain a reference when I merged it into my codebase so I don\'t know where it came from.On the new version v3, They recommended to keep in arrays. as following. See sample at overlay-overview.This was the most simple of all the solutions originally posted by YingYang Mar 11 \'14 at 15:049 under the original response to the users original questionI am using his same solution 2.5 years later with google maps v3.18 and it works like a charmGoogle\'s Demo Gallery has a demo on how they do it:http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/overlay-remove.htmlYou can view the source code to see how they add markers.  Long story short, they keep the markers in a global array.  When clearing/deleting them, they loop through the array and call ".setMap(null)" on the given marker object.However, this example shows one \'trick\'.  "Clear" for this example means removing them from the map but keeping them in the array, which allows the application to quickly re-add them to the map.  In a sense, this acts like "hiding" them."Delete" clears the array as well.is only working on IE.working on chrome, firefox, ie...The "set_map" function posted in both answers appears to no longer work in Google Maps v3 API.I wonder what happenedUpdate:It appears Google changed their API such that "set_map" is not "setMap".http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/v3/reference.htmlA clean and easy application of rolinger\'s answer.The following from Anon works perfectly, although with flickers when repeatedly clearing the overlays.Simply do the following:I. Declare a global variable:II. Define a function:III. Push markers in the \'markerArray\' before calling the following:IV. Call the clearOverlays() function wherever required.That\'s it!!Hope that will help you.I found using markermanager library in the google-maps-utility-library-v3 project as the easiest way.1. Set up the MarkerManager2. Add markers to the MarkerManager 3. To clear markers you just need to call the MarkerManger\'s clearMarkers() functionHere you can find an example of how to remove markers:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/marker-remove?hl=esI have just tried this with kmlLayer.setMap(null) and it worked.  Not sure if that would work with regular markers but appears to work correctly.To clear of all the overlays including polys, markers, etc...simply use:map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map_canvas"), myOptions);}Here is a function that I wrote to do it form me on a map application:You can do it this way too:just clear GooglemapTo remove all markers from map create functions something like this:1.addMarker(location): this function used to add marker on map2.clearMarkers(): this function remove all markers from map, not from array3.setMapOnAll(map): this function used to add markers info in array4.deleteMarkers(): this function Deletes all markers in the array by removing references to them.The solution is very easy. You can use this method: marker.setMap(map);. Here, you define on which map the pin should be appear. So, if you set null in this method (marker.setMap(null);), the pin would be disappear.Now, you can write a function who while make disappear all markers in your map! You just must put your pins in an array and declare them with markers.push (your_new pin) or this code for example:This is a function who can put or disappear all the markers of your array in the map:To disappear all your markers, you should call the function with null:And, to remove and disappear, all your markers, you should reset your array of markers like this:This is my complete code. Be care full you must replace YOUR_API_KEY in the code by your key google API:You can have an axample in google developer or the complete documentation here in, also, google developer web site.I dont\' know why, but, setting setMap(null) to my markers didn\'t work for me when I\'m using DirectionsRenderer.In my case I had to call setMap(null) to my DirectionsRenderer as well.Something like that:This is the method Google themselves use in at least one sample:Check Google sample for complete code example:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-searchbox Just walk over markers and remove them from map, empty maps markers array after that:You mean remove as in hiding them or deleting them?if hiding:if you wish to delete them:notice that I use an array markers to keep track of them and reset it manually.You need to set map null to that marker.if you use the gmap V3 plugin:\n$("#map").gmap("removeAllMarkers");see: http://www.smashinglabs.pl/gmap/documentation#after-loadI know that this maybe a simiple solution, but this is what I doWorks every time for me.Using this you can remove all marker from map .This would help you ,it help me..
