Does anyone know how can I check the system version (e.g. 1.0, 2.2, etc.) programatically?Check android.os.Build.VERSION.Example how to use it:That will give you the actual numbers of your version; aka 2.3.3 or 2.2.\nThe problem with using Build.VERSION.SDK_INT is if you have a rooted phone or custom rom, you could have a none standard OS (aka my android is running 2.3.5) and that will return a null when using Build.VERSION.SDK_INT so Build.VERSION.RELEASE will work no matter what!Build.Version is the place go to for this data. Here is a code snippet for how to format it. Looks like this "Android SDK: 19 (4.4.4)"You can find out the Android version looking at Build.VERSION.The documentation recommends you check Build.VERSION.SDK_INT against the values in Build.VERSION_CODES.This is fine as long as you realise that Build.VERSION.SDK_INT was only introduced in API Level 4, which is to say Android 1.6 (Donut).  So this won\'t affect you, but if you did want your app to run on Android 1.5 or earlier then you would have to use the deprecated Build.VERSION.SDK instead.I can\'t comment on the answers, but there is a huge mistake in Kaushik\'s answer:\nSDK_INT is not the same as system version but actually refers to API Level.The value Build.VERSION_CODES.ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH equals 14.\n14 is the API level of Ice Cream Sandwich, while the system version is 4.0. So if you write 4.0, your code will be executed on all devices starting from Donut, because 4 is the API level of Donut (Build.VERSION_CODES.DONUT equals 4).This example is a reason why using \'magic number\' is a bad habit.For checking device version which is greater than or equal to Marshmallow ,use this code.for ckecking others just change the VERSION_CODES like,\nK for kitkat,\nL for loolipop\nN for Nougat and so on...For example, a feature only works for api21 up the following we fix bugs in api21 downBe aware that Build.VERSION.SDK_INT isn\'t reliable, it\'s mentioned by @Falcon165o and recently I ran into that one too.So to get the String data (based on Android version list) of currently installed android, I made a code like this:Example of an output it produce:Marshmallow v6.0, API Level: 23use this classUse This method:
