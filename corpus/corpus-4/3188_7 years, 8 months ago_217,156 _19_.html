How do you get the Android\'s primary e-mail address (or a list of e-mail addresses)?It\'s my understanding that on OS 2.0+ there\'s support for multiple e-mail addresses, but below 2.0 you can only have one e-mail address per device.There are several ways to do this, shown below.As a friendly warning, be careful and up-front to the user when dealing with account, profile, and contact data. If you misuse a user\'s email address or other personal information, bad things can happen.You can use AccountManager.getAccounts or AccountManager.getAccountsByType to get a list of all account names on the device. Fortunately, for certain account types (including com.google), the account names are email addresses. Example snippet below.Note that this requires the GET_ACCOUNTS permission:More on using AccountManager can be found at the Contact Manager sample code in the SDK.As of Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), you can get the user\'s email addresses by accessing their profile. Accessing the user profile is a bit heavyweight as it requires two permissions (more on that below), but email addresses are fairly sensitive pieces of data, so this is the price of admission.Below is a full example that uses a CursorLoader to retrieve profile data rows containing email addresses.This requires both the READ_PROFILE and READ_CONTACTS permissions:This could be useful to others:Using AccountPicker to get user\'s email address without any global permissions, and allowing the user to be aware and authorize or cancel the process.I would use Android\'s AccountPicker, introduced in ICS. And then wait for the result:This is quite the tricky thing to do in Android and I haven\'t done it yet.
