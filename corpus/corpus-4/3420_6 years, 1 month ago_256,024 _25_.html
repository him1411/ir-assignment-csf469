git revert <commit_hash> alone won\'t work. \'-m\' must be specified, and I\'m pretty confused about it.Anyone experienced this before?The -m option specifies the parent number. This is because a merge commit has more than one parent, and Git does not know automatically which parent was the mainline, and which parent was the branch you want to un-merge.When you view a merge commit in the output of git log, you will see its parents listed on the line that begins with Merge:In this situation, git revert 8f937c6 -m 1 will get you the tree as it was in 8989ee0, and git revert -m 2 will reinstate the tree as it was in 7c6b236.Here\'s a complete example in the hope that it helps someone:Where <commit-hash> is the commit hash of the merge that you would like to revert, and as stated in the explanation of this answer, -m 1 indicates that you\'d like to revert to the tree of the first parent prior to the merge.The git commit ... line essentially commits your changes while the third line makes your changes public by pushing them to the remote branch.Ben has told you how to revert a merge commit, but it\'s very important you realize that doing so "declares that you will never want the tree changes brought in by the merge. As a result, later merges will only bring in tree changes introduced by commits that are not ancestors of the previously reverted merge. This may or may not be what you want." (git-merge man page).An article/mailing list message linked from the man page details the mechanisms and considerations that are involved. Just make sure you understand that if you revert the merge commit, you can\'t just merge the branch again later and expect the same changes to come back.You could follow these steps to revert the incorrect commit(s) or to reset your remote branch back to correct HEAD/state.copy the commit hash (i.e. id of the commit immediately before the wrong commit) from git log\ngit log -n5output: commit 7cd42475d6f95f5896b6f02e902efab0b70e8038 "Merge branch \'wrong-commit\' into \'development\'" \n  commit f9a734f8f44b0b37ccea769b9a2fd774c0f0c012 "this is a wrong commit" \n  commit 3779ab50e72908da92d2cfcd72256d7a09f446ba "this is the correct commit"reset the branch to the commit hash copied in the previous step \ngit reset <commit-hash> (i.e. 3779ab50e72908da92d2cfcd72256d7a09f446ba)Sometimes the most effective way to rollback is to step back and replace.git logUse the 2nd commit hash (full hash, the one you want to revert back to, before the mistake listed) and then rebranch from there.git checkout -b newbranch <HASH>Then delete the old branch, copy the newbranch over in its place and restart from there.If its been broadcast, then delete the old branch from all repositories, push the redone branch to the most central, and pull it back down to all.I found creating a reverse patch between two know end-points and applying that patch would work. This presumes that you have created snapshots (tags) off of your master branch or even a back up of your master branch say master_bk_01012017.Say the code branch you merged into master was mycodebranch.As Ryan mentioned, git revert could make merging difficult down the road, so git revert may not be what you want. I found that using the git reset --hard <commit-hash-prior-to-merge> command to be more useful here.Once you have done the hard reset part, you can then force push to the remote branch, i.e. git push -f <remote-name> <remote-branch-name>, where <remote-name> is often named origin. From that point you can re-merge if you\'d like.
