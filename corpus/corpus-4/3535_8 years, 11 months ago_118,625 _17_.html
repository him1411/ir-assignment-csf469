Is it possible to have an anonymous type implement an interface. I\'ve got a piece of code that I would like to work, but don\'t know how to do this.I\'ve had a couple of answers that either say no, or create a class that implements the interface construct new instances of that. This isn\'t really ideal, but I\'m wondering if there is a mechanism to create a thin dynamic class on top of an interface which would make this simple.I\'ve found an article Dynamic interface wrapping that describes one approach. Is this the best way of doing this?No, anonymous types cannot implement an interface. From the C# programming guide:Anonymous types are class types that consist of one or more public read-only properties. No other kinds of class members such as methods or events are allowed. An anonymous type cannot be cast to any interface or type except for object.While this might be a two year old question, and while the answers in the thread are all true enough, I cannot resist the urge to tell you that it in fact is possible to have an anonymous class implement an interface, even though it takes a bit of creative cheating to get there. Back in 2008 I was writing a custom LINQ provider for my then employer, and at one point I needed to be able to tell "my" anonymous classes from other anonymous ones, which meant having them implement an interface that I could use to type check them. The way we solved it was by using aspects (we used PostSharp), to add the interface implementation directly in the IL. So, in fact, letting anonymous classes implement interfaces is doable, you just need to bend the rules slightly to get there. Casting anonymous types to interfaces has been something I\'ve wanted for a while but unfortunately the current implementation forces you to have an implementation of that interface.The best solution around it is having some type of dynamic proxy that creates the implementation for you. Using the excellent LinFu project you can replacewithNo; an anonymous type can\'t be made to do anything except have a few properties. You will need to create your own type. I didn\'t read the linked article in depth, but it looks like it uses Reflection.Emit to create new types on the fly; but if you limit discussion to things within C# itself you can\'t do what you want.The best solution is just not to use anonymous classes.Note that you need to cast the result of the query to the type of the interface. There might be a better way to do it, but I couldn\'t find it.Anonymous types can implement interfaces via a dynamic proxy.I wrote an extension method on GitHub and a blog post http://wblo.gs/feE to support this scenario. The method can be used like this:The answer to the question specifically asked is no. But have you been looking at mocking frameworks? I use MOQ but there\'s millions of them out there and they allow you to implement/stub (partially or fully) interfaces in-line. Eg.
