My application creates a JavaScript object, like the following:But I need this object as an array. So I tried to convert this object to an array by iterating with $.each through the object and adding the element to an array:Is there an better way to convert an object to an array or maybe a function?Output:If you are looking for a functional approach:Results in:The same with an ES6 arrow function:With ES7 you will be able to use Object.values instead (more information):Or if you are already using Underscore/Lo-Dash:I think you can use for in but checking if the property is not inerithedEDIT - if you want you could also keep the indexes of your object, but you have to check if they are numeric (and you get undefined values for missing indexes:If you know the maximum index in you object you can do the following:Since ES5 Object.keys() returns an array containing the properties defined directly on an object (excluding properties defined in the prototype chain):ES6 takes it one step further with arrow functions:Simply doThat\'s all!The best method would be using a javascript -only function:ECMASCRIPT 5:ECMASCRIPT 2015 or ES6:How about jQuery.makeArray(obj)This is how I did it in my app.Fiddle DemoExtension to answer of bjornd .Array.prototype.slice()Function.prototype.apply()Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()Object.keys()I made a custom function:If you want to keep the name of the object\'s properties as values. Example:Use Object.keys(), Array.map() and Object.assign():Result:Explanation:Object.keys() enumerates all the properties of the source ; .map() applies the => function to each property and returns an Array ; Object.assign() merges name and value for each property. After some tests, here is a general object to array function convertor:You have the object:The function:Function Use:You Get:So then you can reach all keys & values like:Result in console:Edit:Or in prototype form:And then use like:You can also make an array warping any value with this array/make open source component. Examples:There is also an NPM micro-package for that. You can create a simple function to do the conversion from object to array, something like this can do the job for you using pure javascript:or this one:and call and use the function as below:Also in the future we will have something called Object.values(obj), similar to Object.keys(obj) which will return all properties for you as an array, but not supported in many browsers yet...The solving is very simple
