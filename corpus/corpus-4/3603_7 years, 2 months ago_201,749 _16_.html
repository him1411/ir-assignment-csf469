I\'ve got a form, with 2 buttonsI use jQuery UI\'s button on them too, simply like thisHowever, the first button also submits the form. I would have thought that if it didn\'t have the type="submit", it wouldn\'t.Obviously I could do thisBut is there a way I can stop that back button from submitting the form without JavaScript intervention?To be honest, I used a button only so I could style it with jQuery UI. I tried calling button() on the link and it didn\'t work as expected (looked quite ugly!).The default value for the type attribute of button elements is "submit".The button element has a default type of submit.You can make it do nothing by setting a type of button:Just use good old HTML:Wrap it as the subject of a link, if you so desire:Or if you decide you want javascript to provide some other functionality:Honestly, I like the other answers.  Easy and no need to get into JS.  But I noticed that you were asking about jQuery.  So for the sake of completeness, in jQuery if you return false with the .click() handler, it will negate the default action of the widget.See here for an example (and more goodies, too).  Here\'s the documentation, too.in a nutshell, with your sample code, do this:As an added benefit, with this, you can get rid of the anchor tag and just use the button.
