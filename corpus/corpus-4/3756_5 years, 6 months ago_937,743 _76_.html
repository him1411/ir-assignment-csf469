In Windows NT Operating systems, I tried to add this directory to my system PATH environment variable:So I added that directory by "My Computer" > "Properties" > "Advanced" > "Environment Variables" > "Path". I saved it, but when I typed:pathto my console, it doesn\'t show any added "C:\\xampp\\php" directoryPATH=D:\\Program\n  Files\\Autodesk\\Maya2008\\bin;C:\\Ruby192\\bin;C:\\WINDOWS\\system32;C\n  :\\WINDOWS;C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\Wbem;C:\\PROGRA~1\\DISKEE~2\\DISKEE~1\\;c:\\Program\n  Fil es\\Microsoft SQL Server\\90\\Tools\\binn\\;C:\\Program\n  Files\\QuickTime\\QTSystem\\;D:\\P rogram Files\\TortoiseSVN\\bin;D:\\Program\n  Files\\Bazaar;C:\\Program Files\\Android\\an droid-sdk\\tools;D:\\Program\n  Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Common\\Tools\\WinNT;D:\\P rogram\n  Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Common\\MSDev98\\Bin;D:\\Program\n  Files\\Microso ft Visual Studio\\Common\\Tools;D:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\n  Visual Studio\\VC98\\binI have two questions:Why did this happen? Is there something I did wrong?How can I add directories in my PATH variable using the console or programmatically (Through a batch file)?This only modifies the registry.  A process won\'t use these values until it is started after this change and doesn\'t inherit the environment from its parent.You didn\'t specify how you started the console session.  Best way to ensure this is to log out and log back in again.Orset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\xampp\\phpin the command window you have open.Breaking it down:Warning: Don\'t skip the creation of a back-up before using this method\nYou may lose data in your %PATH%, or add irrelevant content merged  from system variables\nIn other words, don\'t blindly copy/paste this.  Use with caution.In Windows 7 and Windows 8 we can permanently set the path from the command line  using the setx command. To add git to "PATH":Note that this command can truncate the path you pass to 1024 characters, losing anything beyond that. In general, be sure to use cmd.exe, and not command.com. Both provide the command line. cmd.exe is newer, and it has fewer restrictions. command.com is older; it has limits like path size.In the Windows 8 family (8 & 8.1) you should run Command Prompt with administrator privileges.Edit: As commented by @FF_DevBecause of the use of %PATH% variable, this command will merge the system environment variables with user ones.You don\'t need any set or setx command, simply open the terminal and type:This shows the current value of PATH variable. Now you want to add directory to it? Simply type:If for any reason you want to clear the PATH variable (no paths at all or delete all paths in it), type:UpdateLike Danial Wilson noted in comment below, it sets the path only in current session. To set the path permanently use setx but be aware, although that sets the path permanently but NOT in the current session, so you have to start a new command line to see the changes, more info here.To check if an environmental variable exist or see its value use ECHO commnad:In this age of PowerShell, I would edit PATH like so:To set the variable for all users, machine-wide, the last line should be like:In a PowerShell script, you might want to check for the presence of your C:\\xampp\\php before adding to PATH (in case it has been previously added). You can wrap it in an if conditional. So putting it all together:Late to the party - but handy if you are already in the directory you want to add to PATH.set PATH=%PATH%;%CD%edit: as per comment - works with standard windows cmd but not in powershell.For powershell the %CD% equivalent is [System.Environment]::CurrentDirectoryWhat if you mistype the path using setx?  The best way is simply through the windows U.I. \nControl Panel->All Control Panel Items->System->Advanced System Setttings->Environment VariablesScroll down to Path and select Edit. You can also copy and paste it into your favorite editor so you can see the entire path and more easily edit it.Nod to all the comments on the @Nafscript\'s initial SETX answer.The ss64 SETX page has some very good examples. Importantly it points to where the registry keys are for SETX vs SETX /MUser Variables: HKCU\\EnvironmentSystem Variables: HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environmentappend_user_path.cmdappend_system_path.cmd. Must be run as admin.(it\'s basically the same except with a different Key and the SETX /M modifier)Finally there\'s potentially an improved version called SETENV recommended by the ss64 SETX page that splits out setting the user or system environment variables.1. Not strictly trueAside from all the answers, if you want a nice GUI tool to edit your windows environment variables you can use Rapid Environment Editortry it! its safe to use and awesome!http://www.rapidee.com/en/Checking the above suggestions on Windows 10 LTSB, and with a glimpse on the "help" outlines (that can be viewed when typing \'command /?\' on the cmd), brought me to the\nconclusion that the PATH command changes the system environment variable Path values only for the current session, but after reboot all the values reset to their default- just as they were prior to using the PATH command.On the other hand using the SETX command with administrative privileges is way more powerful, it changes those values for good (or at least until the next time this command is used or until next time those values are manually GUI manipulated... ).But for the sake of clarity i thought that sharing here the best SETX syntax usage\nthat worked for me might help somebody one day:where any equal sign \'=\' should be avoided, and don\'t you worry about\nspaces! there is no need to insert any more quotation marks for a path\nthat contains spaces inside it- the split sign \';\' do the job.The PATH keyword that follows the SETX defines which set of values should be changed among the System Environment Variables possible values, and the %PATH% (the word PATH surrounded by the percent sign) inside the quotation marks, tells the OS to leave the existing PATH values as they are and add the following path (the one that follows the split sign \';\' ) to the existing values.HTHRegarding point 2 I\'m using a simple batch file that is populating PATH or other environment variables for me. Therefore, there is no pollution of environment variables by default. This batch file is accessible from everywhere so I can type:You can check more details about this simple approach here.To override already included executables; set PATH=C:\\xampp\\php;%PATH%;In a command prompt you tell Cmd to use Explorer\'s command line by prefacing it with start.So start Yourbatchname.Note you have to register as if its name is batchfile.exe.Programs and documents can be added to the registry so typing their name without their path in the Start - Run dialog box or shortcut enables Windows to find them.This is a generic reg file. Copy the lines below to a new Text Document and save it as anyname.reg. Edit it with your programs or documents.In paths use \\ to seperate folder names in key paths as regedit uses a single \\ to seperate it\'s key names. All reg files start with REGEDIT4. A semicolon turns a line into a comment. The @ symbol means to assign the value to the key rather than a named value.The file doesn\'t have to exist. This can be used to set Word.exe to open Winword.exe.Typing start batchfile will start iexplore.exe.You\'ve already been told about path in another answer. Also see doskey /? for cmd macros (they only work when typing).You can run startup commands for CMD. From Windows Recource Kit Technical ReferenceAutoRun DescriptionContains commands which are executed each time you start Cmd.exe.A better alternative to Control Panel is to use this freeware program from sourceforge called Pathenator:https://sourceforge.net/projects/pathenator/However, it only workers for system that has Dot.Net 4.0 or greater such as windows 7,8, or 10.
