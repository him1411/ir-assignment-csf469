I have attached an event to a text box using addEventListener. It works fine. My problem arose when I wanted to trigger the event programmatically from another function. How can I do it?You can use fireEvent on IE 8 or lower, and w3c\'s dispatchEvent on most other browsers. To create the event you want to fire, you can use either createEvent or createEventObject depending on the browser.Here is a self-explanatory piece of code (from prototype) that fires an event dataavailable on an element:A working example:For older browsers polyfill and more complex examples, see MDN docs.See support tables for EventTarget.dispatchEvent and CustomEvent.if you use jQuery, you can simple doand handle it withwhere "[arg0, arg1, ..., argN]" means that these args are optional.If you are supporting IE9+ the you can use the following. The same concept is incorporated in You Might Not Need jQuery.If you are already using jQuery, here is the jQuery version of the code above.I searched for firing click, mousedown and mouseup event on mouseover using JavaScript. I found an answer provided by Juan Mendes. For the answer click here.Click here is the live demo and below is the code:Just to suggest an alternative that does not involve the need to manually invoke a listener event:Whatever your event listener does, move it into a function and call that function from the event listener.Then, you can also call that function anywhere else that you need to accomplish the same thing that the event does when it fires.I find this less "code intensive" and easier to read.I just used the following (seems to be much simpler):In this case the event is triggered only if value was really changed just as you would trigger it by normal focus locus lost performed by user.What you want is something like this:Using jQuery, it would be something like this:
