How can I enable remote requests in IIS Express? Scott Guthrie wrote that is possible but he didn\'t say how.There\'s a blog post up on the IIS team site now explaining how to enable remote connections on IIS Express. Here is the pertinent part of that post summarized:On Vista and Win7, run the following command from an administrative prompt:netsh http add urlacl url=http://vaidesg:8080/ user=everyoneFor XP, first install Windows XP Service Pack 2 Support Tools. Then run the following command from an administrative prompt:httpcfg set urlacl /u http://vaidesg1:8080/ /a D:(A;;GX;;;WD)There are three changes you might need to make. Find your site\'s binding element, and addWhere everyone is a windows group. Use double quotes for groups with spaces like "Tout le monde".Allow IIS Express through Windows firewall. Start / Windows Firewall with Advanced Security / Inbound Rules / New Rule...Program %ProgramFiles%\\IIS Express\\iisexpress.exe\n  OR Port 8080 TCPNow when you start iisexpress.exe you should see a message such asSuccessfully registered URL "http://*:8080/" for site "hello world" application "/" I remember running into the same problems while trying this workflow a few months ago.Which is why I wrote a simple proxy utility specifically for this kind of scenario: https://github.com/icflorescu/iisexpress-proxy.Using the IIS Express Proxy, it all becomes quite simple \xe2\x80\x93 no need to \xe2\x80\x9cnetsh http add urlacl url=vaidesg:8080/ user=everyone\xe2\x80\x9d or to mess up with your \xe2\x80\x9capplicationhost.config\xe2\x80\x9d.Just issue this in command prompt:iisexpress-proxy 8080 to 3000\xe2\x80\xa6and then you can point your remote devices to http://vaidesg:3000.Most of the times simpler IS better.Nothing worked for me until I found iisexpress-proxy. Open command prompt as administrator, then runthenassuming your Visual Studio project opens on localhost:51123 and you want to access on external IP address x.x.x.x:81Edit: just to mention that it works great with noip.comA good resource is Working with SSL at Development Time is easier with IISExpress by Scott Hanselman.What you\'re after is the section Getting IIS Express to serve externally over Port 80As a sidenote to this:This will only work on English versions of Windows. If you are using a localized version you have to replace "everyone" with something else, for example:Otherwise you will get an error (Create SDDL failed, Error: 1332)If you have tried Colonel Panic\'s answer but doesn\'t work in Visual Studio, try this:Append another <binding /> in your IIS Express configFinally, you have to run Visual Studio as AdminThe accepted answer to this question is a guide for getting IIS Express to work with webmatrix. I found this guide more useful when trying to get it to work with VS 2010.I just followed steps 3 & 4 (running IIS Express as administrator) and had to temporarily disable my firewall to get it working.What helped me, was right clicking the \'IISExpress\' icon, \'Show All applications\'. Then selecting the website and I saw which aplicationhost.config it uses, and the the correction went perfectly.I solved it with the installation of "Conveyor by Keyoti" in Visual Studio Professional 2015. Conveyor generate a REMOTE address (your IP) with a port (45455) that enable external request. Example:Conveyor allows you test web applications from from external tablets and phones on your network or from Android emulators (without http://10.0.2.2:<hostport>)The steps are in the following link :https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-1448185.ConveyorbyKeyotiI have some problems using IIS Express in Win 8.1 and external request.I follow this steps to debug the external request: It\'s working!You may try setting up port forwarding instead of trying to modify your IIS Express config, adding new HTTP.sys rules or running Visual Studio as an Admin. Basically you need to forward the IP:PORT your website runs at to some other free port on your machine but on the external network adapter, not localhost. The thing is that IIS Express (at least on Windows 10) binds to [::1]:port meaning it listens on IPv6 port. You need to take this into account.Here is how I made this work - http://programmingflow.com/2017/02/25/iis-express-on-external-ip.htmlHope it helps.If you\'re working with Visual Studio then follow these steps to access the IIS-Express over IP-Adress:I had a local IIS enabled so i just created a rewrite rule to my debugging port... I think this is better and cooler than other method because it is easier to remove once am done developing... Here is how the rewrite looks..VS also allows you to develop using your local IIS directly (which then allows remote connections) but in turn you must always run it as an administrator... I dont like that.If you run\xc2\xa0Visual Studio from Admin you can add just<binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="*:8080:*" />or <binding protocol="https" bindingInformation="*:8443:*" />intoI was unable to serve iis requests to other users in my local network, all I had to do (in addition to the above) was restart my BT Hub router.This is insanely awesome and even covers HTTPS with pretty domain names:http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WorkingWithSSLAtDevelopmentTimeIsEasierWithIISExpress.aspxThe really awesome parts I couldn\'t find anywhere else on SO in case the above link ever goes away:The above utility will register the SSL certificate for you!  If you use the -UseSelfSigned option, it\'s super easy.If you want to do things the hard way, the non-obvious part is you need to tell HTTP.SYS what certificate to use, like this:Certhash is the "Thumbprint" you can get from the certificate properties in MMC.I did the following and was able to connect:1) changed IIS express config binding from local host to \'*\'binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="*:8888:*" 2) Defined inbound rule on firewall to allow the particular port  for the protocol type: tcp3) Add the following command to add network configuration for your port:\n netsh http add urlacl url=http://*:8888/ user=everyoneI solved this problem by using reverse proxy approach.I installed wamp server and used simple reverse proxy feature of apache web server.I added a new port to listen to Apache web server (8081). Then I added proxy configuration as virtualhost for that port.This is what I did for Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2015 to enable remote access, both with http and https:First step is to bind your application to your internal IP address. Run cmd -> ipconfig to get the address. Open the file /{project folder}/.vs/config/applicationhost.config and scroll down until you find something like this:Add two new bindings under bindings. You can use HTTPS as well if you like:Add the following rule to your firewall, open a new cmd prompt as admin and run the following commands:Now start Visual Studio as Administrator. Right click the web projects project file and select Properties. Go to the Web tab, and click Create Virtual Directory. If Visual Studio is not run as Administrator this will probably fail. Now everything should work.
