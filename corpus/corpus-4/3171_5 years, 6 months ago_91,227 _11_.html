So I first forked a repo and then made a commit to that forked repo. I then opened a pull request. The pull request listed all the changes I wanted.After reviewing my pull request, there were a number of changes that the repo owner wanted me to make before he accepted it. I have made those changes in my fork, now how do I update the pull request with those changes (or is this not how I should handle it)?You have done it correctly. The pull request will automatically update. The process is:The pull request will automatically add the new commits at the bottom of the pull request discussion (ie, it\'s already there, scroll down!)Updating a pull request in GitHub is as easy as committing the wanted changes into existing branch (that was used with pull request), but often it is also wanted to squash the changes into single commit: ...and now the pull request contains only one commit.Related links about rebasing:Just push to the branch that the pull request references. As long as the pull request is still open, it should get updated with any added commits automatically.I did it using below steps:If using GitHub on Windows:This is why, before you start making changes of your own, that you should create a branch for each set of changes you plan to put into a pull request.  That way, once you make the pull request, you can then make another branch and continue work on some other task/feature/bugfix without affecting the previous pull request.
