In MySQL, how do I get a list of all foreign key constraints pointing to a particular table? a particular column? This is the same thing as this Oracle question, but for MySQL.For a Table:For a Column:Basically, we changed REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME with REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME in the where clause.EDIT: As pointed out in the comments, this is not the correct answer to the OPs question, but it is useful to know this command. This question showed up in Google for what I was looking for, and figured I\'d leave this answer for the others to find.I found this answer here:\nMySQL : show constraints on tables commandI needed this way because I wanted to see how the FK functioned, rather than just see if it existed or not.If you use InnoDB and defined FK\'s you could query the information_schema database e.g.:Posting on an old answer to add some useful information.I had a similar problem, but I also wanted to see the CONSTRAINT_TYPE along with the REFERENCED table and column names. So,To see all FKs in your table:To see all the tables and FKs in your schema:To see all the FKs in your database:Remember!This is using the InnoDB storage engine. If you can\'t seem to get any foreign keys to show up after adding them it\'s probably because your tables are using MyISAM. To check:To fix, use this:As an alternative to Node\xe2\x80\x99s answer, if you use InnoDB and defined FK\xe2\x80\x99s you could query the information_schema database e.g.:for foreign keys from <table>, orfor foreign keys to <table>You can also get the UPDATE_RULE and DELETE_RULE if you want them.This solution will not only display all relations but also the constraint name, which is required in some cases (e.g. drop contraint):If you want to check tables in a specific database, at the end of the query add the table name:Likewise, for a specific column name, addand table_name = \'table_nameat the end of the query.Inspired by this post hereTo find all tables containing a particular foreign key such as employee_idA quick way to list your FKs (Foreign Key references) using the  This query does assume that the constraints and all referenced and referencing tables are in the same schema.Add your own comment.Source: the official mysql manual.Using REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME does not always work and can be a NULL value. The following query can work instead:The solution I came up with is fragile; it relies on django\'s naming convention for foreign keys.Then, in the shell,Ok Andy\'s answer is great but i want to the foreign key name too:SELECT i.TABLE_SCHEMA, i.TABLE_NAME, i.CONSTRAINT_TYPE, i.CONSTRAINT_NAME, k.COLUMN_NAME, k.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME, k.REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME \nFROM information_schema.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS i \nLEFT JOIN information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE k ON i.CONSTRAINT_NAME = k.CONSTRAINT_NAME \nWHERE i.TABLE_SCHEMA = \'\' AND i.CONSTRAINT_TYPE = \'FOREIGN KEY\' ORDER BY i.TABLE_NAME;
