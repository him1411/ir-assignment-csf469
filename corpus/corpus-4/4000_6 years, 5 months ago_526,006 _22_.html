How to remove a column from an existing table?I have a table MEN with Fname and LnameI need to remove the LnameHow to do it?Generic:In your case: Your example is simple and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require any additional table changes but generally speaking this is not so trivial.If this column is referenced by other tables then you need to figure out what to do with other tables/columns. One option is to remove foreign keys and keep referenced data in other tables.Another option is to find all referencing columns and remove them as well if they are not needed any longer. In such cases the real challenge is finding all foreign keys. You can do this by querying system tables or using third party tools such as ApexSQL Search (free) or Red Gate Dependency tracker (premium but more features). There a whole thread on foreign keys hereThis is the correct answer:But... if a CONSTRAINT exists on the COLUMN, then you must DROP the CONSTRAINT first, then you will be able to DROP the COLUMN.

You will likely need to do so to delete the column.To add columns in existing table:To delete columns in existing table:
