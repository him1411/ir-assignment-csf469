I have this new warning about the Google Framework in my app:(null): URGENT: all bitcode will be dropped because\n  \'/Users/myname/Library/Mobile\n  Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/foldername/appname/GoogleMobileAds.framework/GoogleMobileAds(GADSlot+AdEvents.o)\'\n  was built without bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled\n  (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the\n  vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. Note: This will be an\n  error in the future.Xcode 7 is giving me around 204 warnings about this same concept, and I could not get around with this. Also I have a problem accessing the network from my app. This is the error from the Debugging Area:-canOpenURL: failed for URL: "kindle://home" - error: "This app is\n  not allowed to query for scheme kindle"All of these problems were not present in iOS 8.Your library was compiled without bitcode, but the bitcode option is enabled in your project settings. Say NO to Enable Bitcode in your target Build Settings and the Library Build Settings to remove the warnings.For those wondering if enabling bitcode is required: Note: For iOS apps, bitcode is the default, but optional. If you\n  provide bitcode, all apps and frameworks in the app bundle need to\n  include bitcode. For watchOS apps, bitcode is required.https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.htmlAfter Xcode 7, the bitcode option will be enabled by default. If your library was compiled without bitcode, but the bitcode option is enabled in your project settings, you can:And the Library Build Settings to remove the warnings.For more information, go to documentation of bitcode in developer library.And WWDC 2015 Session 102: "Platforms State of the Union"In my case for avoiding that problem:Be sure that you are dealing with Xcode 7, NOT lower versions. In lower version this flag does not exist.Setup: Project>Build Settings>All>Build Options>Enable Bitcode = NOMethod canOpenUrl is in iOS 9 (due to privacy) changed and is not free to use any more. Your banner provider checks for installed apps so that they do not show banners for an app that is already installed.That gives all the log statements like-canOpenURL: failed for URL: "kindle://home" - error: "This app is not allowed to query for scheme kindle"The providers should update their logic for this.If you need to query for installed apps/available schemes you need to add them to your info.plist file.Add the key \'LSApplicationQueriesSchemes\' to your plist as an array. Then add strings in that array like \'kindle\'.Of course this is not really an option for the banner ads (since those are dynamic), but you can still query that way for your own apps or specific other apps like Twitter and Facebook.Documentation of the canOpenUrl: method\ncanOpenUrl:Documentation about the LSApplicationQueriesSchemes keyIf you are using CocoaPods and you want to disable Bitcode for all libraries, use the following command in the Podfile Disclaimer: This is intended for those supporting a continuous integration workflow that require an automated process. If you don\'t, please use Xcode as described in Javier\'s answer.This worked for me to set ENABLE_BITCODE = NO via the command line:Note that this is likely to be unstable across Xcode versions. It was tested with Xcode 7.0.1 and as part of a Cordova 4.0 project.To fix the issues with the canOpenURL failing. This is because of the new App Transport Security feature in iOS9Read this post to fix that issue http://discoverpioneer.com/blog/2015/09/18/updating-facebook-integration-for-ios-9/This issue has been recently fixed (Nov 2010) by Google, see https://code.google.com/p/analytics-issues/issues/detail?id=671. But be aware that as a good fix it brings more bugs :)You will also have to follow the initialisation method listed here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ios/v2.The latest instructions are going to give you a headache because it references utilities not included in the pod. Below will fail with the cocoapod
