I want to react when somebody shakes the iPhone. I don\'t particularly care how they shake it, just that it was waved vigorously about for a split second. Does anyone know how to detect this?In 3.0, there\'s now an easier way - hook into the new motion events.The main trick is that you need to have some UIView (not UIViewController) that you want as firstResponder to receive the shake event messages.  Here\'s the code that you can use in any UIView to get shake events:You can easily transform any UIView (even system views) into a view that can get the shake event simply by subclassing the view with only these methods (and then selecting this new type instead of the base type in IB, or using it when allocating a view).In the view controller, you want to set this view to become first responder:Don\'t forget that if you have other views that become first responder from user actions (like a search bar or text entry field) you\'ll also need to restore the shaking view first responder status when the other view resigns! This method works even if you set applicationSupportsShakeToEdit to NO.From my Diceshaker application:The histeresis prevents the shake event from triggering multiple times until the user stops the shake.I finally made it work using code examples from this Undo/Redo Manager Tutorial.\nThis is exactly what you need to do:First, Kendall\'s July 10th answer is spot-on.Now ... I wanted to do something similar (in iPhone OS 3.0+), only in my case I wanted it app-wide so I could alert various parts of the app when a shake occurred. Here\'s what I ended up doing.First, I subclassed UIWindow. This is easy peasy. Create a new class file with an interface such as MotionWindow : UIWindow (feel free to pick your own, natch). Add a method like so:Change @"DeviceShaken" to the notification name of your choice. Save the file.Now, if you use a MainWindow.xib (stock Xcode template stuff), go in there and change the class of your Window object from UIWindow to MotionWindow or whatever you called it. Save the xib. If you set up UIWindow programmatically, use your new Window class there instead.Now your app is using the specialized UIWindow class. Wherever you want to be told about a shake, sign up for them notifications! Like this:To remove yourself as an observer:I put mine in viewWillAppear: and viewWillDisappear: where View Controllers are concerned. Be sure your response to the shake event knows if it is "already in progress" or not. Otherwise, if the device is shaken twice in succession, you\'ll have a li\'l traffic jam. This way you can ignore other notifications until you\'re truly done responding to the original notification.Also: You may choose to cue off of motionBegan vs. motionEnded. It\'s up to you. In my case, the effect always needs to take place after the device is at rest (vs. when it starts shaking), so I use motionEnded. Try both and see which one makes more sense ... or detect/notify for both!One more (curious?) observation here: Notice there\'s no sign of first responder management in this code. I\'ve only tried this with Table View Controllers so far and everything seems to work quite nicely together! I can\'t vouch for other scenarios though.Kendall, et. al - can anyone speak to why this might be so for UIWindow subclasses? Is it because the window is at the top of the food chain?I came across this post looking for a "shaking" implementation.  millenomi\'s answer worked well for me, although i was looking for something that required a bit more "shaking action" to trigger. I\'ve replaced to Boolean value with an int shakeCount. I also reimplemented the L0AccelerationIsShaking() method in Objective-C. You can tweak the ammount of shaking required by tweaking the ammount added to shakeCount. I\'m not sure i\'ve found the optimal values yet, but it seems to be working well so far. Hope this helps someone:PS:\nI\'ve set the update interval to 1/15th of a second.You need to check the accelerometer via accelerometer:didAccelerate: method which is part of the UIAccelerometerDelegate protocol and check whether the values go over a threshold for the amount of movement needed for a shake.There is decent sample code in the accelerometer:didAccelerate: method right at the bottom of AppController.m in the GLPaint example which is available on the iPhone developer site.In iOS 8.3 (perhaps earlier) with Swift, it\'s as simple as overriding the motionBegan or motionEnded methods in your view controller:This is the basic delegate code you need:Also set the  in the appropriate code in the Interface. i.e:@interface MyViewController : UIViewController <UIPickerViewDelegate, UIPickerViewDataSource, UIAccelerometerDelegate> Check out the GLPaint example.http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/GLPaint/Introduction/Intro.htmlAdd Following methods in ViewController.m file, its working properlySorry to post this as an answer rather than a comment but as you can see I\'m new to Stack Overflow and so I\'m not yet reputable enough to post comments!Anyway I second @cire about making sure to set the first responder status once the view is part of the view hierarchy. So setting first responder status in your view controllers viewDidLoad method won\'t work for example. And if you\'re unsure as to whether it is working [view becomeFirstResponder] returns you a boolean that you can test.Another point: you can use a view controller to capture the shake event if you don\'t want to create a UIView subclass unnecessarily. I know it\'s not that much hassle but still the option is there. Just move the code snippets that Kendall put into the UIView subclass into your controller and send the becomeFirstResponder and resignFirstResponder messages to self instead of the UIView subclass.First off, I know this is an old post, but it is still relevant, and I found that the two highest voted answers did not detect the shake as early as possible. This is how to do it:In your ViewController:Easiest solution is to derive a new root window for your application:Then in your application delegate:If you are using a Storyboard, this may be trickier, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the code you will need in the application delegate precisely.Just use these three methods to do it for details you may check a complete example code over there A swiftease version based on the very first answer! To enable this app-wide, I created a category on UIWindow:
