I\'m writing a tiny webpage whose purpose is to frame a few other pages, simply to consolidate them into a single browser window for ease of viewing.  A few of the pages I\'m trying to frame forbid being framed and throw a "Refused to display document because display forbidden by X-Frame-Options." error in Chrome.  I understand that this is a security limitation (for good reason), and don\'t have access to change it.Is there any alternative framing or non-framing method to display pages within a single window that won\'t get tripped up by the X-Frame-Options header?I had a similar issue, where I was trying to display content from our own site in an iframe (as a lightbox-style dialog with Colorbox), and where we had an server-wide "X-Frame-Options   SAMEORIGIN" header on the source server preventing it from loading on our test server.This doesn\'t seem to be documented anywhere, but if you can edit the pages you\'re trying to iframe (eg., they\'re your own pages), simply sending another X-Frame-Options header with any string at all disables the SAMEORIGIN or DENY commands.eg. for PHP, putting at the top of your page will make browsers combine the two, which results in a header of...and allows you to load the page in an iframe. This seems to work when the initial SAMEORIGIN command was set at a server level, and you\'d like to override it on a page-by-page case.All the best!If you are getting this error for a YouTube video, rather than using the full url use the embed url from the share options. It will look like http://www.youtube.com/embed/eCfDxZxTBW4You may also replace watch?v= with embed/ so http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCfDxZxTBW4 becomes http://www.youtube.com/embed/eCfDxZxTBW4If you are getting this error while trying to embed a Google Map in an iframe, you need to add &output=embed to the source link.You can bypass X-Frame-Options in an <iframe> using just client-side JavaScript and YQL. Here is a proof of concept: Hacker News in an <iframe>. (Tested in Chrome & Firefox; if it doesn\'t work, try refreshing the page.)The process is as follows:The sample JS code:Adding a to my link in the facebook tab fixed the issue for me...If you\'re getting this error trying to embed Vimeo content, change the src of the iframe, from: https://vimeo.com/63534746 to: http://player.vimeo.com/video/63534746There is a plugin for Chrome, that drops that header entry (for personal use only):https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe/reviewsI had same issue when I tried embed moodle 2 in iframe, solution is Site administration \xe2\x96\xba Security \xe2\x96\xba HTTP security and check Allow frame embeddingThis is the solution guys!!The only thing that worked for facebook apps!I had the same problem with mediawiki, this was because the server denied embedding the page into an iframe for security reasons.I solved it writing into the mediawiki php config file.Hope it helps.The only question that has a bunch of answers. WElcome to the guide i wish i had when i was scrambling for this to make it work at 10:30 at night on the deadline day... FB does some weird things with canvas apps, and well, you\'ve been warned.  If youa re still here and you have a Rails app that will appear behind a Facebook Canvas, then you will need:Gemfile:config/facebook.ymlconfig/application.rbconfig/initializers/omniauth.rbapplication_controller.rbYou need a controller to call from Facebook\'s canvas settings, i used /canvas/ and made the route go the main SiteController for this app:login.html.erbSourcestarget=\'_parent\'Using Kevin Vella\'s idea, I tried adding that attribute to form elements made by PayPal\'s button generator. Worked for me so that Paypal does not open in a new browser window/tab.FWIW:We had a situation where we needed to kill our iFrame when this "breaker" code showed up. So, I used the PHP function get_headers($url); to check out the remote URL before showing it in an iFrame. For better performance, I cached the results to a file so I was not making a HTTP connection each time.I tried nearly all suggestions. However, the only thing that really solved the issue was:Create an .htaccess in the same folder where your PHP file lies.Add this line to the htaccess:Header always unset X-Frame-OptionsEmbedding the PHP by an iframe from another domain should work afterwards.Additionally you could add in the beginning of your PHP file:Which was, however, not necessary in my case. If you are getting this error for a Facebook App and using AJAX calls, i read somewhere that Facebook really likes using # tags for it\'s ajax contact so try changing links, worked for me.I\'m not sure how relevant it is, but I built a work-around to this. On my site, I wanted to display link in a modal window that contained an iframe which loads the URL. What I did is, I linked the click event of the link to this javascript function. All this does is make a request to a PHP file that checks the URL headers for X-FRAME-Options before deciding whether to load the URL within the modal window or to redirect.Here\'s the function:Here\'s the PHP file code that checks for it:Hope this helps.I came across this issue when running a wordpress web site. I tried all sorts of things to fix it and wasn\'t sure how, ultimately the issue was because I was using DNS forwarding with masking, and the links to external sites were not being addressed properly. i.e. my site was hosted at http://123.456.789/index.html but was masked to run at http://somewebSite.com/index.html. When i entered http://123.456.789/index.html in the browser clicking on those same links resulted in no X-frame-origins issues in the JS console, but running http://somewebSite.com/index.html did. In order to properly mask you must add your host\'s DNS name servers to your domain service, i.e. godaddy.com should have name servers of example, ns1.digitalocean.com, ns2.digitalocean.com, ns3.digitalocean.com, if you were using digitalocean.com as your hosting service.If you are using Google Plus APICheck the Javascript Origins in the Google Developers Console, add http and https urlshttp://myawesomedomainname.comhttps://myawesomedomainname.comUse this line given below instead of header() function. It\'s surprising that no one here has ever mentioned Apache server\'s settings (*.conf files) or .htaccess file itself as being a cause of this error. Search through your .htaccess or Apache configuration files, making sure that you don\'t have the following set to DENY:Header always set X-Frame-Options DENYChanging it to SAMEORIGIN, makes things work as expected: Header always set X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGINI was using Tomcat 8.0.30, none of the suggestions worked for me. As we are looking to update the X-Frame-Options and set it to ALLOW, here is how I configured to allow embed iframes: It appears that X-Frame-Options Allow-From https://... is depreciated and was replaced (and gets ignored) if you use Content-Security-Policy header instead.Here is the full reference: https://content-security-policy.com/ Not mentioned but can help in some instances:Make sure you enable the google maps embed api in addition to places API.Generate you map from here:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/startAlso make sure to have 3rd party cookies enabled in your browser. Took me several hours to figure it out, and it solved my problem.i had this problem, and resolved it editing httd.confi changed SAMEORIGIN to GOFORIT\nand restarted   serverSince Facebook uses POST when getting your content for the app\'s iFrame, your server probably isn\'t accepting POST calls from Facebook. I know that the free hosting site Zymic.com doesn\'t. Try using Heroku.com instead.
