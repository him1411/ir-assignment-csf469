I\'m wondering how to make the keyboard disappear when the user touches outside of the UITextField? You\'ll need to add an UITapGestureRecogniser and assign it to the view, and then call resign first responder on the UITextField on it\'s selector.The code:In viewDidLoadIn dismissKeyboard:(Where aTextField is the textfield that is responsible for the keyboard)I mashed up a few answers.Use an ivar that gets initialized during viewDidLoad:Dismiss what ever is currently editing:Check this, this would be the easiest way to do that,OrThis library will handle including scrollbar auto scrolling, tap space to hide the keyboard, etc...https://github.com/michaeltyson/TPKeyboardAvoidingI see that some people are having issues using the UITapGestureRecognizer method. The easiest way that I\'ve accomplished this functionality while still leaving my existing button\'s tap behavior intact is adding only one line to @Jensen2k \'s answer:This allowed my existing buttons to still work without using @Dmitry Sitnikov \'s method. Read about that property here (search for "CancelsTouchesInView"): UIGestureRecognizer Class ReferenceI\'m not sure how it would work with scrollbars, as I see some had issues with, but hopefully someone else might run into the same scenario I had.It is better to make your UIView an instance of UIControl (in interface builder) and then connect their "Touch Up Inside" event to dismissKeyboard method. This IBAction method will look like:Swift version, this works in combination with other elements (like a UIButton or another UITextField):How about this: I know this is an old post. It might help someone :)I think the easiest (and best) way to do this is to subclass your global view and use hitTest:withEvent method to listen to any touch. Touches on keyboard aren\'t registered, so hitTest:withEvent is only called when you touch/scroll/swipe/pinch... somewhere else, then call [self endEditing:YES].This is better than using touchesBegan because touchesBegan are not called if you click on a button on top of the view. It is better than UITapGestureRecognizer which can\'t recognize a scrolling gesture for example. It is also better than using a dim screen because in a complexe and dynamic user interface, you can\'t put dim screen every where. Moreover, it doesn\'t block other actions, you don\'t need to tap twice to select a button outside (like in the case of a UIPopover).Also, it\'s better than calling [textField resignFirstResponder], because you may have many text fields on screen, so this works for all of them.This is a good generic solution:Objective-C:Swift:Based on @icodebuster solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18756253/417652This must be the easiest way to hide your keyboard by touching outside :(from How to dismiss keyboard when user tap other area outside textfield?)If I got you right you want to resign keyboard wile tapping on outSide of textfield but you don\'t have reference of your textfield.Try this;Now in textFieldDidBeginEditing set referenced text field to Now you can happily use on any button clock, (adding a transparent button on begin editing recomended)Or for resigning done button try this.You can do this using the Storyboard in XCode 6 and above:Add this to the header file of the class used by your ViewController:Then add this to the implementation file of the same ViewController:This will now be one of the \'Received Actions\' for your storyboard scene (i.e. ViewController):Now you need to hook up this action to the user gesture of touching off the keyboard.Important - You need to convert the \'UIView\' that\'s contained in your storyboard to a UIControl, so it can receive events. Select the view from your View Controller Scene hierarchy:...and change its class:Now drag from the small circle next to the \'received action\' for your scene, onto an \'empty\' part of your scene (actually you\'re dragging the \'Received Action\' to the UIControl). You\'ll be shown a selection of events that you can hook up your action to:Select the \'touch up inside\' option. You\'ve now hooked the IBAction you created to a user action of touching off the keyboard. When the user taps off the keyboard, it will now be hidden.(NOTE: To hook the action to the event, you can also drag from the received action directly onto the UIControl in your View Controllers hierarchy. It\'s displayed as \'Control\' in the hierarchy.)You can use UITapGestureRecongnizer method for dismissing keyboard  by clicking outside of UITextField. By using this method whenever user will click outside of UITextField then keyboard will get dismiss. Below is the code snippet for using it.Just to add to the list here my version of how to dismiss a keyboard on outside touch.viewDidLoad:Anywhere:Plenty of great answers here about using UITapGestureRecognizer--all of which break UITextField\'s clear (X) button. The solution is to suppress the gesture recognizer via its delegate:It\'s not the most robust solution but it works for me.You can create category for the UiView and override the touchesBegan meathod as follows.It is working fine for me.And it is centralize solution for this problem.Swift version of @Jensen2k\'s answer:One linerI used Barry example for my new development. It worked great! but i had to include a slightly change, required to dismiss the keyboard only for the textfield being edited.So, I added to Barry example the following:Also, I changed hideKeyboard method as follows:If the view is embedded at all in a UIScrollView then you can use the following:The former will animate the keyboard off screen when the table view is scrolled and the later will hide the keyboard like the stock Messages app.Note that these are are available on iOS 7.0 or above.One of the most easiest and shortest way is to add this code to your viewDidLoadSend message resignFirstResponder to the textfiled that put it there. Please see this post for more information.In this example, aTextField is the only UITextField.... If there are others or UITextViews, there\'s a tiny bit more to do.I tried many of the responses here and had no luck.  My tap gesture recognizer was always causing my UIButtons to not respond when tapped, even when I set the cancelsTouchesInView property of the gesture recognizer to NO.This is what eventually solved the issue:Have an ivar:When a text field begins editing, set the gesture recognizer:Then the trick is in how you set up the dismissKeyboard method:I guess there\'s just something about getting the dismissKeyboardSelector execution out of the touch handling execution stack...Add this code in your ViewController.m file :In this case, there can be use ScrollView and added to TextField in ScrollView and I want Tap the ScrollView and View then Dismiss the Keyboard. I tried to create sample code just in case. Like this,Your Storyboard Look at that Just Like.Set text fields delegate in view did load:Add this Function:For those struggling with this in Swift. This is the accepted answer by Jensen2k but in Swift.Swift 2.3just use this code in your .m file it will resign the textfield when user tap outside of the textfield.
