I\'ve heard much about the understandable abhorrence of using .Select in Excel VBA, but am unsure of how to avoid using it. I am finding that my code would be more re-usable if I were able to use variables instead of Select functions. However, I am not sure how to refer to things (like the ActiveCell etc.) if not using Select.  I have found this article on ranges and this example on the benefits of not using select but can\'t find anything on how?Some examples of how to avoid selectUse Dim\'d variablesSet the variable to the required range.  There are many ways to refer to a single-cell rangeor a multi-cell rangeAll the above examples refer to cells on the active sheet.  Unless you specifically want to work only with the active sheet, it is better to Dim a Worksheet variable tooAgain, this refers to the active workbook, so you may want to be explicit here too.Pass ranges to your Sub\'s and Function\'s as Range variablesYou should also apply Methods (such as Find and Copy) to variablesIf you are looping over a range of cells it is often better (faster) to copy the range values to a variant array first and loop over thatThis is a small taster for what\'s possible.Two Main reasons why .Select/.Activate/Selection/Activecell/Activesheet/Activeworkbook etc... should be avoidedHow do we avoid it?1) Directly work with the relevant objectsConsider this codeThis code can also be written as2) If required declare your variables. The same code above can be written asOne small point of emphasis I\'ll add to all the excellent answers given above: Probably the biggest thing you can do to avoid using Select is to as much as possible, use named ranges (combined with meaningful variable names) in your VBA code. This point was mentioned above, but glossed over a bit; however, it deserves special attention. Here are a couple additional reasons to make liberal use of named ranges though I am sure I could think of more.Example:It is pretty obvious what the named ranges Months and MonthlySales contain, and what the procedure is doing.Why is this important? Partially because it is easier for other people to understand it, but even if you are the only person who will ever see or use your code, you should still use named ranges and good variable names because YOU WILL FORGET what you meant to do with it a year later, and you will waste 30 minutes just figuring out what your code is doing.Consider, if the above example had been written like this:This code will work just fine at first - that is until you or a future user decides "gee wiz, I think I\'m going to add a new column with the year in Column A!", or put an expenses column between the months and sales columns, or add a header to each column. Now, your code is broken. And because you used terrible variable names, it will take you a lot more time to figure out how to fix it than it should take. If you had used named ranges to begin with, the Months and Sales columns could be moved around all you like, and your code will continue working just fine. I\'m going to give the short answer since everyone else gave the long one.You\'ll get .select and .activate whenever you record macros and reuse them.  When you .select a cell or sheet it just makes it active.  From that point on whenever you use unqualified references like Range.Value they just use the active cell and sheet.  This can also be problematic if you don\'t watch where your code is placed or a user clicks on the workbook.So, you can elinate these issues by directly referencing your cells.  Which goes:Or you couldThere are various combinations of these methods, but that would be the general idea expressed as shortly as possible for impatient people like me."... and am finding that my code would be more re-usable if I were able to use variables instead of Select functions."While I cannot think of any more than an isolated handful of situations where .Select would be a better choice than direct cell referencing, I would rise to the defense of Selection and point out that it should not be thrown out for the same reasons that .Select should be avoided.There are times when having short, time-saving macro sub routines assigned to hot-key combinations available with the tap of a couple of keys saves a lot of time. Being able to select a group of cells to enact the operational code on works wonders when dealing with pocketed data that does not conform to a worksheet-wide data format. Much in the same way that you might select a group of cells and apply a format change, selecting a group of cells to run special macro code against can be a major time saver.Examples of Selection-based sub framework:The actual code to process could be anything from a single line to multiple modules. I have used this method to initiate long running routines on a ragged selection of cells containing the filenames of external workbooks.In short, don\'t discard Selection due to its close association with .Select and ActiveCell. As a worksheet property it has many other purposes.(Yes, I know this question was about .Select, not Selection but I wanted to remove any misconceptions that novice VBA coders might infer.)Please note that in the following I\'m comparing the Select approach (the one that the OP wants to avoid), with the Range approach (and this is the answer to the question). So don\'t stop reading when you see the first Select. It really depends on what you are trying to do. Anyway a simple example could be useful. Let\'s suppose that you want to set the value of the active cell to "foo". Using ActiveCell you would write something like this:If you want to use it for a cell that is not the active one, for instance for "B2", you should select it first, like this:Using Ranges you can write a more generic macro that can be used to set the value of any cell you want to whatever you want:Then you can rewrite Macro2 as:And Macro1 as:Hope this helps to clear things up a little bit.Always state the workbook, worksheet and the cell/range.For example:Because end users will always just click buttons and as soon as the focus moves off of the workbook the code wants to work with then things go completely wrong.And never use the index of a workbook.You don\'t know what other workbooks will be open when the user runs your code.IMHO use of .select comes from people, who like me started learning VBA by necessity through recording macros and then modifying the code without realizing that .select and subsequent selection is just an unnecessary middle-men..select can be avoided, as many posted already, by directly working with the already existing objects, which allows various indirect referencing like calculating i and j in a complex way and then editing cell(i,j), etc.Otherwise, there is nothing implicitly wrong with .select itself and you can find uses for this easily, e.g. I have a spreadsheet that I populate with date, activate macro that does some magic with it and exports it in an acceptable format on a separate sheet, which, however, requires some final manual (unpredictable) inputs into an adjacent cell. So here comes the moment for .select that saves me that additional mouse movement and click.Quick Answer:To avoid using the .Select method you can set a variable equal to the property that you want.\xe2\x96\xba For instance, if you want the value in Cell A1 you could set a variable equal to the value property of that cell.\xe2\x96\xba For instance, if you want the codename of \'Sheet3` you could set a variable equal to the codename property of that worksheet.I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any questions.This is an example that will clear the contents of cell "A1" (or more if the selection type is xllastcell, etc). All done without having to select the cells. I hope this helps someone.This is how you may avoid Select in the following cases:From:To:You may access them with []. Which is really beautiful, compared to the other way. Check yourself:The example from above would look like this:Usually, if you are willing to select, most probably you are copying something. If you are only interested in the values, this is a good option to avoid select:Range("B1:B6").value = Range("A1:A6").Value
