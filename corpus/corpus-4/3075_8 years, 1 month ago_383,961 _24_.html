I have two apps that use Integrated Security. One assigns Integrated Security = true in the connection string,  and the other sets Integrated Security = SSPI.What is the difference between SSPI and true in the context of Integrated Security?According to Microsoft they are the same thing.When false, User ID and Password are specified in the connection. When true, the current Windows account credentials are used for authentication.\n  Recognized values are true, false, yes, no, and sspi (strongly recommended), which is equivalent to true.Integrated Security=true; doesn\'t work in all SQL providers, it throws an exception when used with the OleDb provider. So basically Integrated Security=SSPI; is preferred since works with both SQLClient & OleDB provider.Other options are:\nfor more information refer : Connection String Syntax (ADO.NET)Using Windows AuthenticationTo connect to the database server is recommended to use Windows Authentication, commonly known as integrated security. To specify the Windows authentication, you can use any of the following two key-value pairs with the data provider. NET Framework for SQL Server:However, only the second works with the data provider .NET Framework OleDb. If you set Integrated Security = true for ConnectionString an exception is thrown.To specify the Windows authentication in the data provider. NET Framework for ODBC, you should use the following key-value pair.Source: MSDN: Working with Connection StringsMany questions get answers if we use .Net Reflector to see the actual code of SqlConnection :)\ntrue and sspi are the same:Integrated Security = False : User ID and Password are specified in the connection. \nIntegrated Security = true : the current Windows account credentials are used for authentication.Integrated Security = SSPI : this is equivalant to true. We can avoid the username and password attributes from the connection string and use the Integrated SecurityLet me start with Integrated Security = falsefalse  User ID and Password are specified in the connection string.\ntrue  Windows account credentials are used for authentication.   Recognized values are true, false, yes, no, and SSPI.If User ID and Password are specified and Integrated Security is set to true, then User ID and Password will be ignored and Integrated Security will be usedNote that connection strings are specific to what and how you are connecting to data. These are connecting to the same database but the first is using .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server. Integrated Security=True will not work for OleDb.When in doubt use the Visual Studio Server Explorer Data Connections.True is only valid if you\'re using the .NET SqlClient library. It isn\'t valid when using OLEDB.\nWhere SSPI is bvaid in both either you are using .net SqlClient library or OLEDB.
