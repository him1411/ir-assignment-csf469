I\'ve been using Git on Windows (msysgit) to track changes for some design work I\'ve been doing.Today I\'ve been working on a different PC (with remote repo brian) and I\'m now trying to merge the edits done today back into my regular local version on my laptop.On my laptop, I\'ve used git pull brian master to pull the changes into my local version. Everything was fine apart from the main InDesign document - this shows as a conflict.The version on the PC (brian) is the latest one that I want to keep but I don\'t know what commands tells the repo to use this one. I tried directly copying the file across onto my laptop but this seems to break the whole merge process.Can anyone point me in the right direction?git checkout accepts an --ours or --theirs option for cases like this. So if you have a merge conflict, and you know you just want the file from the branch you are merging in, you can do:to use that version of the file. Likewise, if you know you want your version (not the one being merged in) you can useYou have to resolve the conflict manually (copying the file over) and then commit the file (no matter if you copied it over or used the local version) like thisGit normally autocommits after merging, but when it detects conflicts it cannot solve by itself, it applies all patches it figured out and leaves the rest for you to resolve and commit manually. The Git Merge Man Page, the Git-SVN Crash Course or this blog entry might shed some light on how it\'s supposed to work.Edit: See the post below, you don\'t actually have to copy the files yourself, but can use to select the version of the file you want. Copying / editing the file will only be necessary if you want a mix of both versions.Please mark mipadis answer as the correct one.You can also overcame this problem withwhich causes git to create local copies of the conflicted binary and spawn your default editor on them:Obviously you can\'t usefully edit binaries files in a text editor. Instead you copy the new {conflicted}.REMOTE file over {conflicted} without closing the editor. Then when you do close the editor git will see that the undecorated working-copy has been changed and your merge conflict is resolved in the usual way.To resolve by keeping the version in your current branch (ignore the version from the branch you are merging in), just add and commit the file:To resolve by overwriting the version in your current branch with the version from the branch you are merging in, you need to retrieve that version into your working directory first, and then add/commit it:Explained in more detailFrom the git checkout docsgit checkout [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=<style>] [<tree-ish>] [--] <paths>... --ours\n  --theirs\n  When checking out paths from the index, check out stage #2 (ours) or #3 (theirs) for unmerged paths.The index may contain unmerged entries because of a previous failed merge. By default, if you try to check out such an entry from the index, the checkout operation will fail and nothing will be checked out. Using -f will ignore these unmerged entries. The contents from a specific side of the merge can be checked out of the index by using --ours or --theirs. With -m, changes made to the working tree file can be discarded to re-create the original conflicted merge result.mipadi\'s answer didn\'t quite work for me, I needed to do this :git checkout --ours path/to/file.binor, to keep the version being merged in:git checkout --theirs path/to/file.binthengit add path/to/file.binAnd then I was able to do "git mergetool" again and continue onto the next conflict.I came across a similar problem (wanting to pull a commit that included some binary files which caused conflicts when merged), but came across a different solution that can be done entirely using git (i.e. not having to manually copy files over).  I figured I\'d include it here so at the very least I can remember it the next time I need it. :)  The steps look like this:This fetches the latest commit(s) from the remote repository (you may need to specify a remote branch name, depending on your setup), but doesn\'t try to merge them.  It records the the commit in FETCH_HEADThis takes the copy of the binary files I want and overwrites what\'s in the working tree with the version fetched from the remote branch.  git doesn\'t try to do any merging, so you just end up with an exact copy of the binary file from the remote branch.  Once that\'s done, you can add/commit the new copy just like normal.  I\'ve come across two strategies for managing diff/merge of binary files with Git on windows.Tortoise git lets you configure diff/merge tools for different file types based on their file extensions. See 2.35.4.3. Diff/Merge Advanced Settings http://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-settings.html. This strategy of course relys on suitable diff/merge tools being available.Using git attributes you can specify a tool/command to convert your binary file to text and then let your default diff/merge tool do it\'s thing. See http://git-scm.com/book/it/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes. The article even gives an example of using meta data to diff images.I got both strategies to work with binary files of software models, but we went with tortoise git as the configuration was easy.If the binary is something more than a dll or something that can be edited directly like a image, or a blend file (and you don\'t need to trash/select one file or the other) a real merge would be some like:I suggest search for a diff tool oriented to what are you binary file, for example there are some free ones for image files for exampleand compare them.If there is no diff tool out there for compare your files, then if you have the original generator of the bin file (that is, there exist an editor for it... like blender 3d, you can then manually inspect those files, also see the logs, and ask the other person what you should include)\nand do a output of the files with https://git-scm.com/book/es/v2/Git-Tools-Advanced-Merging#_manual_remerge\n$ git show :1:hello.blend > hello.common.blend\n$ git show :2:hello.blend > hello.ours.blend\n$ git show :3:hello.blend > hello.theirs.blend\n
