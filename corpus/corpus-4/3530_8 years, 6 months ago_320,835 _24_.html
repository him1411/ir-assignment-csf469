What is the simplest way to get the directory that a file is in? I\'m using this to set a working directory.In this example, I should get "C:\\MyDirectory".If you\'ve definitely got an absolute path, use Path.GetDirectoryName(path).If you might only get a relative name, use new FileInfo(path).Directory.FullName.Note that Path and FileInfo are both found in the namespace System.IO.You can use System.IO.Path.GetDirectory(filename), or turn the path into a FileInfo, and use FileInfo.Directory.If you\'re doing other things with the path, the FileInfo may have advantages.You can use Path.GetDirectoryName and just pass in the filename.MSDN LinkUse below mentioned code to get the folder pathThis will return "C:\\MyDirectory" in your caseIf you are working with a FileInfo object, then there is an easy way to extract a string representation of the directory\'s full path via the DirectoryName property. Description of the FileInfo.DirectoryName Property via MSDN:Gets a string representing the directory\'s full path.Sample usage:Link to the MSDN documentation.You can get the current Application Path using:Good Luck!First, you have to use System.IO namespace. Then;orYou can use Path.GetFullPath for most of the case.\nBut if you want to get the path also in the case of the file name is relatively located then you can use the below generic method:For example:GetPath("C:\\Temp\\Filename.txt") return "C:\\Temp\\"GetPath("Filename.txt") return current working directory like "C:\\Temp\\"
