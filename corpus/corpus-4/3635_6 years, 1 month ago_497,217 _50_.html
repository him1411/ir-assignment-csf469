This question already has an answer here:The XMLHttpRequest Level 2 standard (still a working draft) defines the FormData interface. This interface enables appending File objects to XHR-requests (Ajax-requests).Btw, this is a new feature - in the past, the "hidden-iframe-trick" was used (read about that in my other question).This is how it works (example):where input is a <input type="file"> field, and handler is the success-handler for the Ajax-request.This works beautifully in all browsers (again, except IE).Now, I would like to make this functionality work with jQuery. I tried this:Unfortunately, that won\'t work (an "Illegal invocation" error is thrown - screenshot is here). I assume jQuery expects a simple key-value object representing form-field-names / values, and the FormData instance that I\'m passing in is apparently incompatible.Now, since it is possible to pass a FormData instance into xhr.send(), I hope that it is also possible to make it work with jQuery.Update:I\'ve created a "feature ticket" over at jQuery\'s Bug Tracker. It\'s here: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9995I was suggested to use an "Ajax prefilter"...Update:First, let me give a demo demonstrating what behavior I would like to achieve. HTML:JavaScript:The above code results in this HTTP-request:This is what I need - I want that "multipart/form-data" content-type!The proposed solution would be like so:However, this results in:As you can see, the content type is wrong...I believe you could do it like this : Setting processData to false lets you prevent jQuery from automatically transforming the data into a query string. See the docs for more info.Setting the contentType to false is imperative, since otherwise jQuery will set it incorrectly.There are a few yet to be mentioned techniques available for you. Start with setting the contentType property in your ajax params.Building on pradeek\'s example:In some cases when forcing jQuery ajax to do non-expected things, the beforeSend event is a great place to do it. For a while people were using beforeSend to override the mimeType before that was added into jQuery in 1.5.1. You should be able to modify just about anything on the jqXHR object in the before send event.You can send the FormData object in ajax request using the following code,This is very similar to the accepted answer but an actual answer for the question topic. This will submit the form elements automatically in the FormData and you don\'t need to manually append the data to FormData variable.The ajax method looks like this,You can also manually pass the form element inside the FormData object as parameter like thisHope it helps. ;)You can use the $.ajax beforeSend event to manipulate the header.\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6See this link for additional information: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536752(v=vs.85).aspxI think you cant do it in ajax to support all the browsers, I might say good to check this ajax uploader plugin to see how they have done it http://valums.com/ajax-upload/I do it like this and it\'s work for me, I hope this will help :)If you want to submit files using ajax use "jquery.form.js"\nThis submits all form elements easily.Samples\nhttp://jquery.malsup.com/form/#ajaxSubmitrough view :\nJavaScript:PHP:Instead of -  fd.append( \'userfile\', $(\'#userfile\')[0].files[0]);Use - fd.append( \'file\', $(\'#userfile\')[0].files[0]);The best documentation and example I found was here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Using_FormData_Objects
