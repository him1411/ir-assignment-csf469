I\'m trying to install maven through the terminal by following these instructions.So far I got thisThis is probably a stupid question where do you go to find this?OS X prior to Mavericks (10.9) actually comes with Maven 3 built in.  If you\'re on OS X Lion, you won\'t have java installed by default.  Just run java by itself and it\'ll prompt you to install it.Assuming qualifications are met, run mvn -version and see some output like this:Alternatively, I recommend installing Homebrew for these kinds of utilities.Then you just install Maven using:PS: If you got a 404 error, try doing a brew update just beforeDisclaimer: Here is a complete answer taking the last version of OS X (10.9 AKA Mavericks) into account. I am aware that everything I compiled in this answer is already present in the page, but having it clearly in one answer makes it a lot clearer.First of all, with previous versions of OS X, Maven is installed by default. If Java is missing running you@host:~ $ java in a terminal will prompt you for the Java installation.With Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), Maven is not installed by default anymore. Different options are then possible:When I upgraded recently to OS X Mavericks and my maven builds start failing. So I needed to install maven again as it doesn\'t come built in. Then I tried with the command:it works, but it installs the version 3.1.1 of maven which causes some problems for a few users like (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/AetherClassNotFound). So if you\'re running into the same issue you will probably want to install the earlier Maven version, the 3.0.5. To do that with Homebrew, you have to execute the following command:That\'s it, it will then use a different Homebrew\'s formulae which will give you the maven 3.0.5 instead.If using MacPorts on OS X 10.9 Mavericks, you can simply do:To install Maven on OS X, go to the Apache Maven website and download the binary zip file.You can then shift the apache-maven-3.0.5 folder in your Downloads folder to wherever you want to keep Maven; however as the rest of the process involves the command line, I recommend you do everything from there.At the command line, you would run something like:This is just my personal preference - to have a "Development" directory in my home directory.  You can choose something else if you wish.Next, edit ~/.profile in the editor of your choice, and add the following:The first line is important to Maven (and must be a full explcit path); the second line is important to the shell, in order to run the "mvn" binary.  If you have a variation of that second line already in .profile, then simply add ${M2_HOME}/bin to the end of it.Now open a second terminal window and runwhich should give output like...Couple of things to note:If you\'ve installed the Oracle JDK 1.7, then you may find Maven reports JDK 1.6 in the above output.  To solve this, add the following to your ~/.profile:export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home) As some have pointed out, Maven has historically been supplied either with OS X itself, or with the optional Command Line Tools for XCode.  This may cease to be the case for future versions of OS X, and in fact OS X Mavericks does not include Maven.  Personal opinion:  This could be because they are still in beta, or it could be that Apple have taken a look at the latest Thoughtworks Technology Radar, and spotted that Maven has been moved to "Hold".  macOS Sierra onwardsbrew install mavenThis command brew install maven30 didn\'t work for me. Was complaining about a missing FORMULA. But the following command did work. I\'ve got maven-3.0.5 installed.This is for Mac OS X 10.9 aka Mavericks.If you don\'t want to install Homebrew only for install Maven you could simply do this:Download the binary Maven and extract the zipLaunch the Terminal and type this command:sudo ln -s /path_to_maven_folder/bin/mvn /usr/bin/mvnYou can find more details on this post.for the ones that just migrated to mavericks - I used the *-ux solution;modified .bash_profile and added:Open a TERMINAL window and check if you have it already installed.Type:And you should see:If you don\'t have Maven installed already, then here is how to download and install maven, and configure environment variables on Mac OS X:\nhttp://bitbybitblog.com/install-maven-mac/On Maverick, run in the terminal \nxcode-select --install\nto install the Command Line Tools.This worked for me:$ vim .bash_profile export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)$ source .bash_profilecredit: http://www.mkyong.com/java/maven-java_home-is-not-defined-correctly-on-mac-osx/For those who wanna use maven2 in Mavericks, type:brew tap homebrew/versionsbrew install maven2If you have already installed maven3, backup 3 links (mvn, m2.conf, mvnDebug) in /usr/local/bin first:mkdir bakmv m* bak/then reinstall:brew uninstall maven2(only when conflicted)brew install maven2
