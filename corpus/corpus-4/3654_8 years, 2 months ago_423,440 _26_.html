How can I convert the following?2934 (integer)  to   B76 (hex)Let me explain what I am trying to do. I have User IDs in my database that are stored as integers. Rather than having users reference their IDs I want to let them use the hex value. The main reason is because it\'s shorter.So not only do I need to go from integer to hex but I also need to go from hex to integer.Is there an easy way to do this in C#?from http://www.geekpedia.com/KB8_How-do-I-convert-from-decimal-to-hex-and-hex-to-decimal.htmlUse:See How to: Convert Between Hexadecimal Strings and Numeric Types (C# Programming Guide) for more information and examples.Try the following to convert it to hexAnd back againI really question the value of this, though.  You\'re stated goal is to make the value shorter, which it will, but that isn\'t a goal in itself.  You really mean either make it easier to remember or easier to type.If you mean easier to remember, then you\'re taking a step backwards.  We know it\'s still the same size, just encoded differently.  But your users won\'t know that the letters are restricted to \'A-F\', and so the ID will occupy the same conceptual space for them as if the letter \'A-Z\' were allowed.  So instead of being like memorizing a telephone number, it\'s more like memorizing a GUID (of equivalent length).If you mean typing, instead of being able to use the keypad the user now must use the main part of the keyboard.  It\'s likely to be more difficult to type, because it won\'t be a word their fingers recognize.A much better option is to actually let them pick a real username.To Hex:To int:I created my own solution for converting int to Hex string and back before I found this answer. Not surprisingly, it\'s considerably faster than the .net solution since there\'s less code overhead.Timing code:Results:A fashionably belated response, but have you considered some sort of Integer shortening implementation? If the only goal is to make the user ID as short as possible, I\'d be interested to know if there is any other apparent reason why you specifically require hexadecimal conversion - unless I missed it of course. Is it clear and known (if so required) that user IDs are in actual fact a hexadecimal representation of the real value?int to hex:int a = 72;Console.WriteLine("{0:X}", a);hex to int:int b = 0xB76;Console.WriteLine(b);
