Does anybody know why JUnit 4 provides assertEquals(foo,bar) but not assertNotEqual(foo,bar) methods? It provides assertNotSame (corresponding to assertSame) and assertFalse (corresponding to assertTrue), so it seems strange that they didn\'t bother including assertNotEqual.By the way, I know that JUnit-addons provides the methods I\'m looking for. I\'m just asking out of curiosity.I\'d suggest you use the newer assertThat() style asserts, which can easily describe all kinds of negations and automatically build a description of what you expected and what you got if the assertion fails:All three options are equivalent, choose the one you find most readable.To use the simple names of the methods (and allow this tense syntax to work), you need these imports:There is an assertNotEquals in JUnit 4.11: https://github.com/junit-team/junit/blob/master/doc/ReleaseNotes4.11.md#improvements-to-assert-and-assumeI wonder same. The API of Assert is not very symmetric; for testing whether objects are the same, it provides assertSame and assertNotSame.Of course, it is not too long to write:With such an assertion, the only informative part of the output is unfortunately the name of the test method, so descriptive message should be formed separately:That is of course so tedious, that it is better to roll your own assertNotEqual. Luckily in future it will maybe be part of the JUnit: JUnit issue 22I\'d argue that the absence of assertNotEqual is indeed an asymmetry and makes JUnit a bit less learnable. Mind that this is a neat case when adding a method would diminish the complexity of the API, at least for me: Symmetry helps ruling the bigger space.\nMy guess is that the reason for the omission may be that there are too few people calling for the method. Yet, I remember a time when even assertFalse did not exist; hence, I have a positive expectation that the method might eventually be added, given that it is not a difficult one; even though I acknowledge that there are numerous workarounds, even elegant ones.I\'m coming to this party pretty late but I have found that the form:can be made to work for most \'not equals\' cases.  The obvious reason that people wanted assertNotEquals() was to compare builtins without having to convert them to full blown objects first:Verbose example:vs. Sadly since Eclipse doesn\'t include JUnit 4.11 by default you must be verbose.Caveat I don\'t think the \'1\' needs to be wrapped in an Integer.valueOf() but since I\'m newly returned from .NET don\'t count on my correctness.I am working on JUnit in java 8 environment, using jUnit4.12for me: compiler was not able to find the method assertNotEquals, even when I used\n    import org.junit.Assert;So I changed assertNotEquals("addb", string);toAssert.assertNotEquals("addb", string);So if you are facing problem regarding assertNotEqual not recognized, then change it to Assert.assertNotEquals(,); it should solve your problemIt\'s better to use the Hamcrest for negative assertions rather than assertFalse as in the former the test report will show a diff for the assertion failure.If you use assertFalse, you just get an assertion failure in the report. i.e. lost information on cause of the failure.Modulo API consistency, why JUnit didn\'t provide assertNotEquals() is the same reason why JUnit never provided methods likei.e. there\'s no end to providing a specific assertion methods for the kinds of things you might want in your assertion logic!Far better to provide composable test primitives like equalTo(...), is(...), not(...), regex(...) and let the programmer piece those together instead for more readability and sanity.
