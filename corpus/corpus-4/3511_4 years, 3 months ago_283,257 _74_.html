Is there a way to ng-repeat a defined number of times instead of always having to iterate over an array?For example, below I want the list item to show up 5 times assuming $scope.number equal to 5 in addition incrementing the number so each list item increments like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5Desired result:At the moment, ng-repeat only accepts a collection as a parameter, but you could do this:And somewhere in your controller:This would allow you to change $scope.number to any number as you please and still maintain the binding you\'re looking for.Here is a fiddle with a couple of lists using the same getNumber function.EDIT 1/6/2014:  Newer versions of Angular make use of the following syntax:you can do this:Here is an example of how you could do this.  Note that I was inspired by a comment in the ng-repeat docs: http://jsfiddle.net/digitalzebra/wnWY6/Note the ng-repeat directive:Here is the controller:I think this jsFiddle from this thread might be what you\'re looking for.I ran into the same issue.  I came across this thread, but didn\'t like the methods they had here.  My solution was using underscore.js, which we had already installed.  It\'s as simple as this:This will do exactly what you\'re looking for.I wanted to keep my html very minimal, so defined a small filter that creates the array [0,1,2,...] as others have done:After that, on the view is possible to use like this:This is really UGLY, but it works without a controller for either an integer or variable:integer:variable:There are many ways to do this.  I was really bothered at having the logic in my controller so  I created a simple directive to solve the problem of repeating an element n-times.Installation:The directive can be installed using bower install angular-repeat-nExample:produces: 1234It also works using a scope variable:Source:GithubThis is only a slight variation on the accepted answer, but you don\'t really need to create a new function. Only to import \'Array\' in the scope:See this fiddle for a live example.JS (in your AngularJS controller)HTML...where repeatCount is the number of repetitions that should appear in this location.angular gives a very sweet function called slice.. using this you can achieve what you are looking for.\ne.g. ng-repeat="ab in abc.slice(startIndex,endIndex)"this demo :http://jsfiddle.net/sahilosheal/LurcV/39/ will help you out and tell you how to use this "making life easy" function. :)html:CSS:ng-JS:A simpler approach would be (for an example of 5 times):Heres an answer for angular 1.2.xBasically it is the same, with the slight modification of of the ng-repeat here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cHQLH/153/this is because angular 1.2 doesn\'t allow duplicate values in the directive. This means if you are trying to do the following, you will get an error.You can use the ng-if directive with ng-repeatSo, if num is the number of times you need the element repeated:For users using CoffeeScript, you can use a range comprehension:Directive or Controller Template First, create an angular filter using LoDash:The LoDash times function is capable of handling null, undefined, 0, numbers, and string representation of numbers.Then, use it in your HTML as this:or You can use this example.Inside controller:Example for select element at the HTML code side:If n is not too high, another option could be to use split(\'\') with a string of n characters :I needed a more dynamic solution to this - where I could increment the repeat.HTML Duplicator ControlJSAngular provides filters to modify a collection. In this case the collection would be null, i.e. [], and the filter also takes arguments, as follows:JS:This method is very similar to those proposed above and isn\'t necessarily superior but shows the power of filters in AngularJS.I encountered the same problem and this is what I came out with:... and the html:LIVE EXAMPLEI used underscore\'s times function as we where already using it on the project, but you can easily replace that with native code.I am creating a reusable directive where the max number will come from another ng-repeat. So, this is an edit over the best voted answer. Just change the code at controller to this -This will return a new array with specified number of iterationssince this declaration prints 4 elements:we can use this ugly but no-footprint workaround using the number|n decimal places native filter.this way you\'ll have mynumber elements with no extra code.\nRemember to subtract 2 to mynumber to avoid the first two \'0.\' characters prepended to the decimal places (like \'0.0000\').\nEdited:\ndoesn\'t work for numbers less than 3. But might be useful in some cases.
