Sometimes the spaces get URL encoded to the + sign, some other times to %20. What is the difference and why should this happen?+ means a space only in application/x-www-form-urlencoded content, such as the query part of a URL:In this URL, the parameter name is query name with a space and the value is query value with a space, but the folder name in the path is literally foo+bar, not foo bar.%20 is a valid way to encode a space in either of these contexts. So if you need to URL-encode a string for inclusion in part of a URL, it is always safe to replace spaces with %20 and pluses with %2B. This is what eg. encodeURIComponent() does in JavaScript. Unfortunately it\'s not what urlencode does in PHP (rawurlencode is safer).See Also\nHTML 4.01 Specification application/x-www-form-urlencodedhttp://www.example.com/some/path/to/resource?param1=value1The part before the question mark must use % encoding (so %20 for space), after the question mark you can use either %20 or + for a space. If you need an actual + after the question mark use %2B.Its better to always encode spaces as %20, not as "+".It was RFC-1866 (HTML 2.0 specification), which specified that space characters should be encoded as "+" in "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content-type key-value pairs. (see paragraph 8.2.1. subparagraph 1.). This way of encoding form data is also given in later HTML specifications, look for relevant paragraphs about application/x-www-form-urlencoded.Here is an example of such a string in URL where RFC-1866 allows encoding spaces as pluses: "http://example.com/over/there?name=foo+bar". So, only after "?", spaces can be replaced by pluses, according to RFC-1866. In other cases, spaces should be encoded to %20. But since it\'s hard to determine the context, it\'s the best practice to never encode spaces as "+".I would recommend to percent-encode all character except "unreserved" defined in RFC-3986, p.2.3What\'s the difference: See other answers.When use + instead of %20? Use + if, for some reason, you want to make the URL query string (?.....) or hash fragment (#....) more readable. Example: You can actually read this:https://www.google.se/#q=google+doesn%27t+encode+:+and+uses+%2B+instead+of+spaces\n(%2B = +)But the following is a lot harder to read: (at least to me)https://www.google.se/#q=google%20doesn%27t%20oops%20:%20%20this%20text%20%2B%20is%20different%20spacesI would think + is unlikely to break anything, since Google uses + (see the 1st link above) and they\'ve probably thought about this. I\'m going to use + myself just because readable + Google thinks it\'s OK.
