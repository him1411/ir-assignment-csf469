When using Facebook Sharer, Facebook will offer the user the option of using 1 of a few images pulled from the source as a preview for their link. How are these images selected, and how can I ensure that any particular image on my page is always included in this list?Facebook has a set of open-graph meta tags that it looks at to decide which image to show.  The keys one for the Facebook image are:and it should be present inside the <head></head> tag at the top of your page.  If these tags are not present, it will look for their older method of specifying an image: <link rel="image_src" href="/myimage.jpg"/>.  If neither are present, Facebook will look at the content of your page and choose images from your page that meet its share image criteria: Image must be at least 200px by 200px, have a maximum aspect ratio of 3:1, and in PNG, JPEG or GIF format. Can I specify multiple images to allow the user to select an image?Yes, you just need to add multiple image meta tags in the order you want them to appear in. The user will then be presented with an image selector dialog:\nI specified the appropriate image meta tags. Why isn\'t Facebook accepting the changes?Once a url has been shared, Facebook\'s crawler, which has a user agent of facebookexternalhit/1.1 (+https://www.facebook.com/externalhit_uatext.php), will access your page and cache the meta information.  To force Facebook servers to clear the cache, use the Facebook Url Debugger / Linter Tool that they launched in June 2010 to refresh the cache and troubleshoot any meta tag issues on your page.  Also, the images on the page must be publicly accessible to the Facebook crawler.  You should specify absolute url\'s like http://example.com/yourimage.jpg instead of just /yourimage.jpg.  Can I update these meta tags with client side code like Javascript or jQuery?\nNo.  Much like search engine crawlers, the Facebook scraper does not execute scripts so whatever meta tags are present when the page is downloaded are the meta tags that are used for image selection.Adding these tags causes my page to no longer validate. How can I fix this?You can add the necessary Facebook namespaces to your  tag and your page should then pass validation:When you share for Facebook, you have to add in your html into the head section next meta tags: And that\'s it!Add the button as you should according to what FB tells you.All the info you need is in www.facebook.com/share/As of 2013, if you\'re using facebook.com/sharer.php (PHP) you can simply make any button/link like:Link query parameters:It\'s plain simple: you do not need any js or other settings. Is just an HTML raw link.\nStyle the A tag in any way you want to.Put the following tag in the head:From http://www.facebook.com/share_partners.phpAs far as what it chooses as the default in the absence of this tag, I\'m not sure.From my experience, the http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php does not use meta tags. It uses the string you pass. See below.http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?s=100&p[title]=THIS IS MY TITLE&p[summary]=THIS IS MY SUMMARY&p[url]=http://www.MYURL.com&&p[images][0]=http://www.MYURL.com/img/IMAGEADDRESSThe meta tags work with Facebook\'s developer like/send buttons, as does the other Open Graph info. So if you use one of Facebook\'s actual elements like the comments and such, that will all tie into the Open Graph stuff.UPDATE: There are two ways to use the sharer * note the ?s versus the ?u value in the query string\n1 ==> STRING: http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?s + content from above\n~~> Will pull info from the string.\n2 ==> URL: http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=url where url equals an actual url\n~~> Will scrape the page provided in the url value\n~~> You can test test the values here: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debugOld way, no longer works:Reported new way, also does not work:It randomly worked off and on during the first day I implemented it, hasn\'t worked at all since.The Facebook linter page, a utility that inspects your page, reports that everything is correct and does display the thumbnail I selected... just that the share.php page itself doesn\'t seem to be functioning.  Has to be a bug over at Facebook, one they apparently don\'t care to fix as every bug report regarding this issue I\'ve seen in their system all say resolved or fixed.To change Title, Description and Image, we need to add some meta tags under head tag.STEP 1 :\nAdd meta tags under head tag     NEXT STEP :\nClick on below link\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/tools/debugAdd your URL in text box (e.g http://www.test.com/) where you mentioned the tags.\nClick on DEBUG button.Its done. You can verify here https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.test.com/In above url, u = your website linkENJOY !!!!For secure HTTPS I had this problem and fixed it with manuel-84\'s suggestion.  Using a 400x400px image worked great, while my smaller image never showed up in the sharer.Note that Facebook recommends a minimum 200px square image as the og:image tag:  https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/howtos/maximizing-distribution-media-content/#tagsThis is what worked for me: I placed the desired thumbnail image on the page right after the tag and making it too small to see..I have not tested it with height 0 and width 0 but it probably will still work.. This does not guarantee the user will select this image..ALSO it seems like Facebook caches the thumbnails on your page and doesnt always check it for new ones.. try adding this to another page on your site and you\'ll see that it works.I couldn\'t get Facebook to pick the right image from a specific post, so I did what\'s outlined on this page:https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/18468/adding-meta-tags-to-individual-blogger-postsIn other words, something like this:Basically, you\'re going to hard code an if statement into your site\'s HTML to get it to change the meta content for whatever you\'ve changed for that one post. It\'s a messy solution, but it works. Use facebook feed dialog instead of share dialog to show custom Images Example:
