What is the quickest way to HTTP GET in Python if I know the content will be a string? I am searching the docs for a quick one-liner like:But all I can find using Google are httplib and urllib - and I am unable to find a shortcut in those libraries.Does standard Python 2.5 have a shortcut in some form as above, or should I write a function url_get?Python 2.x:Python 3.x:Documentation for urllib.request and read.How is that?You could use a library called requests.This is quite easy. Then you can do like this:If you want solution with httplib2 to be oneliner consider instatntinating anonymous Http objectHave a look at httplib2, which - next to a lot of very useful features - provides exactly what you want.Where content would be the response body (as a string), and resp would contain the status and response headers.It doesn\'t come included with a standard python install though (but it only requires standard python), but it\'s definitely worth checking out.theller\'s solution for wget is really useful, however, i found it does not print out the progress throughout the downloading process. It\'s perfect if you add one line after the print statement in reporthook.Here is a wget script in Python:Excellent solutions Xuan, Theller.For it to work with python 3 make the following changesAlso, the URL you enter should be preceded by a "http://", otherwise it returns a unknown url type error.If you are working with HTTP APIs specifically, there are also more convenient choices such as Nap.For example, here\'s how to get gists from Github since May 1st 2014:More examples: https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/nap#examples
