I have a slider that can be pulled up and then it shows a map. I can move the slider up and down to hide or show the map. When the map is on front, I can handle touch events on that map. Everytime I touch, a AsyncTask is fired up, it downloads some data and makes a Toast that displays the data. Although I start the task on touch event no toast is displayed, not till I close the slider. When the slider is closed and the map is not displayed anymore the Toast appears.Any ideas?Well start the taskEDIT:and in onPostExecute make a toastIn new TestTask(this), this is a reference to MapOverlay and not to MapActivity, so this was the problem.In order to display Toast in your application, try this:Another example:We can define two constants for duration:int   LENGTH_LONG Show the view or text notification for a long period\n  of time.int   LENGTH_SHORT    Show the view or text notification for a short period\n  of time.Extending activity using baseadapter used thisor if you are using activity or mainactivitygetApplicationContext() - Returns the context for all activities running in application.getBaseContext() -  If you want to access Context from another context within  application you can access.getContext() - Returns the context view only current running activity.text - Return "STRING" , If not string you can use type cast.Toast.LENGTH_SHORT - Toast delay 2000 ms predefinedToast.LENGTH_LONG  - Toast delay 3500 ms predefinedmilisecond  - Toast delay user defined miliseconds (eg. 4000)Example.1Example.2You can customize your tost:Or General way:There are two ways to do it.Either use the inbuilt Toast message or make a custom one by providing custom layout fileI have tried several toast and for those whom their toast is giving them error tryTo toast in Androidor( LENGTH_SHORT and LENGTH_LONG are acting as boolean flags - which means you cant sent toast timer to miliseconds, but you need to use either of those 2 options )If it\'s fragment,I ran across the answers here, and was attracted by the fact that there seems to be someone poking around, believing that an Activity context is required.  This is not the case.  However, it is a requirement that a Toast is posted from the main event or UI Thread.  So, getting this to work outside of an activity context is a little bit tricky.  Here is an example that would work inside of a system service, or any potential class that ultimately inherits from Context.Note that we do not need access to an instance of Activity for this to work.  Please stop suggesting this is the case!  If Activity were required, the method signature wouldn\'t call for a Context.For displaying Toast use the following code:Toast toast = new Toast(getApplicationContext());instead of using "app.getBaseContext()".  You can try using "getApplicationContext()" or "getContext()".  If your code is in activity then you should use "this" of "Activty.this".\nIf your code is in fragment then you should go for "getActivity()"Simplest way! (To Display In Your Main Activity, replace First Argument for other activity)
