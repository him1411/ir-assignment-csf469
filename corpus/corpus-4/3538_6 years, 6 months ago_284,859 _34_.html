This question already has an answer here:Is it possible to set same height as width (ratio 1:1)?ExampleCSSUsing jQuery you can achieve this by doing[Update: Although I discovered this trick independently, I\xe2\x80\x99ve since learned that Thierry Koblentz beat me to it. You can find his 2009 article on A List Apart. Credit where credit is due.]I know this is an old question, but I encountered a similar problem that I did solve only with CSS.
