How do you convert a numerical number to an Excel column name in C# without using automation getting the value directly from Excel.Excel 2007 has a possible range of 1 to 16384, which is the number of columns that it supports. The resulting values should be in the form of excel column names, e.g. A, AA, AAA etc.Here\'s how I do it:If anyone needs to do this in Excel without VBA, here is a way:where colNum is the column numberAnd in VBA:Sorry, this is Python instead of C#, but at least the results are correct:I discovered an error in my first post, so I decided to sit down and do the the math.  What I found is that the number system used to identify Excel columns is not a base 26 system, as another person posted.  Consider the following in base 10.  You can also do this with the letters of the alphabet.Space:.........................S1, S2, S3 : S1, S2, S3\n....................................0, 00, 000 :.. A, AA, AAA\n....................................1, 01, 001 :.. B, AB, AAB\n.................................... \xe2\x80\xa6, \xe2\x80\xa6, \xe2\x80\xa6 :.. \xe2\x80\xa6, \xe2\x80\xa6, \xe2\x80\xa6\n....................................9, 99, 999 :.. Z, ZZ, ZZZ\nTotal states in space:    10, 100, 1000 : 26, 676, 17576\nTotal States:...............1110................18278Excel numbers columns in the individual alphabetical spaces using base 26.  You can see that in general, the state space progression is a, a^2, a^3, \xe2\x80\xa6 for some base a, and the total number of states is a + a^2 + a^3 + \xe2\x80\xa6 . Suppose you want to find the total number of states A in the first N spaces.  The formula for doing so is A = (a)(a^N - 1 )/(a-1).  This is important because we need to find the space N that corresponds to our index K.  If I want to find out where K lies in the number system I need to replace A with K and solve for N.  The solution is N = log{base a} (A (a-1)/a +1).  If I use the example of a = 10 and K = 192, I know that N = 2.23804\xe2\x80\xa6 .  This tells me that K lies at the beginning of the third space since it is a little greater than two.The next step is to find exactly how far in the current space we are.  To find this, subtract from K the A generated using the floor of N.  In this example, the floor of N is two.  So, A = (10)(10^2 \xe2\x80\x93 1)/(10-1) = 110, as is expected when you combine the states of the first two spaces.  This needs to be subtracted from K because these first 110 states would have already been accounted for in the first two spaces.  This leaves us with 82 states.  So, in this number system, the representation of 192 in base 10 is 082.  The C# code using a base index of zero is//Old PostA zero-based solution in C#.You might need conversion both ways, e.g from Excel column adress like AAZ to integer and from any integer to Excel.  The two methods below will do just that.  Assumes 1 based indexing, first element in your "arrays" are element number 1.\nNo limits on size here, so you can use adresses like ERROR and that would be column number 2613824 ...Update: Peter\'s comment is right. That\'s what I get for writing code in the browser. :-) My solution was not compiling, it was missing the left-most letter and it was building the string in reverse order - all now fixed.Bugs aside, the algorithm is basically converting a number from base 10 to base 26.Update 2: Joel Coehoorn is right - the code above will return AB for 27. If it was real base 26 number, AA would be equal to A and the next number after Z would be BA.Easy with recursion.This answer is in javaScript:Same implementaion in Java ..And converted to php:After looking at all the supplied Versions here, i descided to do one myself, using recursion.Here is my vb.net Version:A little late to the game, but here\'s the code I use (in C#):In Delphi (Pascal):I\'m surprised all of the solutions so far contain either iteration or recursion.Here\'s my solution that runs in constant time (no loops).  This solution works for all possible Excel columns and checks that the input can be turned into an Excel column.  Possible columns are in the range [A, XFD] or [1, 16384].  (This is dependent on your version of Excel)I wanted to throw in my static class I use, for interoping between col index and col Label. I use a modified accepted answer for my ColumnLabel MethodUse this like...Its not exactly base 26, there is no 0 in the system. If there was, \'Z\' would be followed by \'BA\' not by \'AA\'.if you just want it for a cell formula without code, here\'s a formula for it:Just throwing in a simple two-line C# implementation using recursion, because all the answers here seem far more complicated than necessary.Refining the original solution (in C#):Here is an Actionscript version:JavaScript SolutionIn perl, for an input of 1 (A), 27 (AA), etc.Here\'s my super late implementation in PHP. This one\'s recursive. I wrote it just before I found this post. I wanted to see if others had solved this problem already...I\'m trying to do the same thing in Java...\nI\'ve wrote following code:Now once I ran it with columnNumber = 29, it gives me the result = "CA" (instead of "AC")\nany comments what I\'m missing?\nI know I can reverse it by StringBuilder.... But looking at the Graham\'s answer, I\'m little confused....Another VBA wayThese my codes to convert specific number (index start from 1) to Excel Column.My Unit Test:I\'m using this one in VB.NET 2003 and it works well...Another solution:see more here - Cell referencing in Excel for everyone! by Dr Nitin ParanjapeUsing this in VB.Net 2005 :
