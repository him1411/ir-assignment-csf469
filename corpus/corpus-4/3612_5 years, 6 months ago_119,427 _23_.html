When I run:What exactly is origin and why do I have to type it before the branch name?origin is an alias on your system for a particular remote repository. It\'s not actually a property of that repository.By doingyou\'re saying to push to the origin repository. There\'s no requirement to name the remote repository origin: in fact the same repository could have a different alias for another developer.Remotes are simply an alias that store the url of repositories.  You can see what url belongs to each remote by using In the push command, you can use remotes or you can simply use a url directly. An example that uses the url origin is not the remote repository name. It is rather a local alias set as a key in place of the remote repository URL. It avoids the user having to type the whole remote URL when prompting a push.This name is set by default and for convention by git when cloning from a remote for the first time.This alias name is not hard coded and could be changed using following command prompt :Take a look at http://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote for further clarifications.Git has the concept of "remotes", which are simply URLs to other copies of your repository. When you clone another repository, git automatically creates a remote named "origin" and points to it.You can see more info about the remote by typing git remote show originorigin is the default alias to the URL of your remote repository.I was also confused by this, and below is what I have learned.When you clone a repository, for example from GitHub:origin is the alias for the URL from which you cloned the repository. Note that you can change this alias.There is one master branch in the remote repository (aliased by origin). There is also another master branch created locally.Further information can be found from this SO question: Git branching: master vs. origin/master vs. remotes/origin/masterWhen you clone a repository with git clone, it automatically creates a remote connection called origin pointing back to the cloned repository. This is useful for developers creating a local copy of a central repository since it provides an easy way to pull upstream changes or publish local commits. This behavior is also why most Git-based projects call their central repository origin.Simple! "origin" is just what you nicknamed your remote repository when you ran some code like this:That\'s a GitHub repository example. From then on git knows that "origin" points to that specific repository. You could have named it "github" or "repo" or whatever you want.
