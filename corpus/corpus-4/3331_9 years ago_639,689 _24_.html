I didn\'t see any similar questions asked on this topic, and I had to research this for something I\'m working on right now. Thought I would post the answer for it in case anyone else had the same question.char(13) is CR. For DOS-/Windows-style CRLF linebreaks, you want char(13)+char(10), like:I found the answer here: http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2007/08/22/sql-server-t-sql-script-to-insert-carriage-return-and-new-line-feed-in-code/You just concatenate the string and insert a CHAR(13) where you want your line break. Example:This prints out the following:This is line 1.\n  This is line 2.Another way to do this is as such:That is, simply inserting a line break in your query while writing it will add the like break to the database. This works in SQL server Management studio and Query Analyzer. I believe this will also work in C# if you use the @ sign on strings. Following a Google...Taking the code from the website:Looks like it can be done by replacing a placeholder with CHAR(13)Good question, never done it myself :)I got here because I was concerned that cr-lfs that I specified in C# strings were not being shown in SQl Server Management Studio query responses.It turns out, they are there, but are not being displayed.To "see" the cr-lfs, use the print statement like:Run this in SSMS, it shows how line breaks in the SQL itself become part of string values that span lines :Result :\nLine 1\nLine 2\nLine 3  How long is a blank line feed?\n2  What are the ASCII values?\n13\n10  Or if you\'d rather specify your string on one line (almost!) you could employ REPLACE() like this (optionally use CHAR(13)+CHAR(10) as the replacement) :Here\'s a C# function that prepends a text line to an existing text blob, delimited by CRLFs, and returns a T-SQL expression suitable for INSERT or UPDATE operations.  It\'s got some of our proprietary error handling in it, but once you rip that out, it may be helpful -- I hope so.This is always cool, because when you get exported lists from, say Oracle, then you get records spanning several lines, which in turn can be interesting for, say, cvs files, so beware.Anyhow, Rob\'s answer is good, but I would advice to use something else than @, try a few more, like \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7@@\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 or something, so it will have a chance for some uniqueness. (But still, remember the length of the varchar/nvarchar field you are inserting into..)
