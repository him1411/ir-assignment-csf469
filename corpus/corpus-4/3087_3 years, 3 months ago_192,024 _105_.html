So I have a Nginx running inside a docker container, I have a mysql running on localhost, I want to connect to the MySql from within my Nginx. The MySql is running on localhost and not exposing a port to the outside world, so its bound on localhost, not bound on the ip address of the machine.Is there any way to connect to this MySql or any other program on localhost from within this docker container?Docker offers different networking modes when running containers. Depending on the mode you choose you would connect to your MySQL database running on the docker host differently.Docker creates a bridge named docker0 by default. Both the docker host and the docker containers have an IP address on that bridge.on the Docker host, type sudo ip addr show docker0 you will have an output looking like:So here my docker host has the IP address 172.17.42.1 on the docker0 network interface.Now start a new container and get a shell on it: docker run --rm -it ubuntu:trusty bash -il and within the container type ip addr show eth0 to discover how its main network interface is set up:Here my container has the IP address 172.17.1.192. Now look at the routing table:So the IP Address of the docker host 172.17.42.1 is set as the default route and is accessible from your container.Alternatively you can run a docker container with network settings set to host. Such a container will share the network stack with the docker host and from the container point of view, localhost (or 127.0.0.1) will refer to the docker host.Be aware that any port opened in your docker container would be opened on the docker host. And this without requiring the -p or -P docker run option.IP config on my docker host:and from a docker container in host mode:As you can see both the docker host and docker container share the exact same network interface and as such have the same IP address.To access MySQL running on the docker host from containers in bridge mode, you need to make sure the MySQL service is listening for connections on the 172.17.42.1 IP address.To do so, make sure you have either bind-address = 172.17.42.1 or bind-address = 0.0.0.0 in your MySQL config file (my.cnf). If you need to set an environment variable with the IP address of the gateway, you can run the following code in a container :then in your application, use the DOCKER_HOST_IP environment variable to open the connection to MySQL.Note: if you use bind-address = 0.0.0.0 your MySQL server will listen for connections on all network interfaces. That means your MySQL server could be reached from the Internet ; make sure to setup firewall rules accordingly.Note 2: if you use bind-address = 172.17.42.1 your MySQL server won\'t listen for connections made to 127.0.0.1. Processes running on the docker host that would want to connect to MySQL would have to use the 172.17.42.1 IP address.To access MySQL running on the docker host from containers in host mode, you can keep bind-address = 127.0.0.1 in your MySQL configuration and all you need to do is to connect to 127.0.0.1 from your containers:note: Do use mysql -h 127.0.0.1 and not mysql -h localhost; otherwise the MySQL client would try to connect using a unix socket.Solution for macOSDocker for Mac v 17.06 and above (June 2017)Use your mac\'s internal IP address or connect to the special Mac-only DNS name docker.for.mac.localhost which will resolve to the internal IP address used by the host. (Thanks to user @Kyr)Docker for Mac 17.05 and belowTo access host machine from the docker container you must attach an IP alias to your network interface. You can bind whichever IP you want, just make sure you\'re not using it to anything else.sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 123.123.123.123/24 Then make sure that you server is listening to the IP mentioned above or 0.0.0.0. If it\'s listening on localhost 127.0.0.1 it will not accept the connection.Then just point your docker container to this IP and you can access the host machine!To test you can run something like curl -X GET 123.123.123.123:3000 inside the container.The alias will reset on every reboot so create a start-up script if necessary.Solution and more documentation here: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workaroundsI doing a hack similar to above posts of get the local IP to map to a alias name (DNS) in the container. The major problem is to get dynamically with a simple script that works both in Linux and OSX the host IP address. I did this script that works in both environments (even in Linux distribution with "$LANG" != "en_*" configured):So, using Docker Compose, the full configuration will be:Startup script (docker-run.sh):docker-compose.yml:Then change http://localhost to http://dockerhost in your code.For a more advance guide of how to customize the DOCKERHOST script, take a look at this post with a explanation of how it works.This worked for me on an NGINX/PHP-FPM stack without touching any code or networking where the app\'s just expecting to be able to connect to localhostMount mysqld.sock from the host to inside the container.Find the location of the mysql.sock file on the host running mysql:\nnetstat -ln | awk \'/mysql(.*)?\\.sock/ { print $9 }\'Mount that file to where it\'s expected in the docker:\ndocker run -v /hostpath/to/mysqld.sock:/containerpath/to/mysqld.sockPossible locations of mysqld.sock:\n/tmp/mysqld.sock\n/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock \n/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sockEdit: I ended up prototyping out the concept on GitHub. Check out: https://github.com/sivabudh/system-in-a-boxFirst, my answer is geared towards 2 groups of people: those who use a Mac, and those who use Linux.The host network mode doesn\'t work on a Mac. You have to use an IP alias, see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43541681/2713729What is a host network mode? See: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/network-settingsSecondly, for those of you who are using Linux (my direct experience was with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I\'m upgrading to 16.04 LTS in production soon), yes, you can make the service running inside a Docker container connect to localhost services running on the Docker host (eg. your laptop).How?The key is when you run the Docker container, you have to run it with the host mode. The command looks like this:docker run --network="host" -id <Docker image ID>When you do an ifconfig (you will need to apt-get install net-tools your container for ifconfig to be callable) inside your container, you will see that the network interfaces are the same as the one on Docker host (eg. your laptop). It\'s important to note that I\'m a Mac user, but I run Ubuntu under Parallels, so using a Mac is not a disadvantage. ;-)And this is how you connect NGINX container to the MySQL running on a localhost.For those on Windows, assuming you\'re using the bridge network driver, you\'ll want to specifically bind MySQL to the ip address of the hyper-v network interface. This is done via the configuration file under the normally hidden C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL folder. Binding to 0.0.0.0 will not work. The address needed is shown in the docker configuration as well, and in my case was 10.0.75.1.Here is my solution : it works for my caseset local mysql server to public access by comment \n\n  #bind-address   = 127.0.0.1\n\n in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.drestart mysql server \nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql restartrun the following command to open user root access any host\nmysql -uroot -proot\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO \'root\'@\'%\' IDENTIFIED BY \'root\' WITH \nGRANT OPTION;\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\ncreate sh script : run_docker.shrun with docker-composerservices:\n  tomcatwar:\n     extra_hosts:\n        - "local:10.1.2.232"\n     image: sopheamak/springboot_docker_mysql\n     ports:\n         - 8080:8080\n     environment:\n            - DATABASE_HOST=local\n            - DATABASE_USER=root\n            - DATABASE_PASSWORD=root\n            - DATABASE_NAME=demo\n            - DATABASE_PORT=3306I disagree with the answer from Thomasleveil.Making mysql bind to 172.17.42.1 will prevent other programs using the database on the host to reach it. This will only work if all your database users are dockerized.Making mysql bind to 0.0.0.0 will open the db to outside world, which is not only a very bad thing to do, but also contrary to what the original question author wants to do. He explicitly says "The MySql is running on localhost and not exposing a port to the outside world, so its bound on localhost"To answer the comment from ivant"Why not bind mysql to docker0 as well?"This is not possible. The mysql/mariadb documentation explicitly says it is not possible to bind to several interfaces. You can only bind to 0, 1, or all interfaces.As a conclusion, I have NOT found any way to reach the (localhost only) database on the host from a docker container. That definitely seems like a very very common pattern, but I don\'t know how to do it.Simplest solution for Mac OSXJust use the IP address of your Mac. On the Mac run this to get the IP address and use it from within the container:As long as the server running locally on your Mac or in another docker container is listening to 0.0.0.0, the docker container will be able to reach out at that address.If you just want to access another docker container that is listening on 0.0.0.0 you can use 172.17.0.1The CGroups and Namespaces are playing major role in the Container Ecosystem.Namespace provide a layer of isolation. Each container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace. The Cgroups controls the resource utilization of each container, whereas Namespace controls what a process can see and access the respective resource. Here is the basic understanding of the solution approach you could follow,Use Network NamespaceWhen a container spawns out of image, a network interface is defined and create. This gives the container unique IP address and interface.By changing the namespace to host, cotainers networks does not remain isolated to its interface, the process will have access to host machines network interface.If the process listens on ports, they\'ll be listened on the host interface and mapped to the container.Use PID Namespace\nBy changing the Pid namespace allows a container to interact with other process beyond its normal scope.This container will run in its own namespace.By changing the namespace to the host, the container can also see all the other processes running on the system.Sharing NamespaceThis is a bad practice to do this in production because you are breaking out of the container security model which might open up for vulnerabilities, and easy access to eavesdropper. This is only for debugging tools and understating the loopholes in container security.The first container is nginx server. This will create a new network and process namespace. This container will bind itself to port 80 of newly created network interface. Another container can now reuse this namespace,Also, this container can see the interface with the processes in a shared container.This will allow you give more privileges to containers without changing or restarting the application. In the similar way you can connect to mysql on host, run and debug your application. But, its not recommend to go by this way. Hope it helps. You can use ngrok to create a secure tunnel to your localhost machine and then expose that tunnel to your docker container.ngrok is free to use as of 05/22/2017.Steps:1) go to ngrok2) download the ngrok client and follow installation instructions3) SIGN UP for an account and they will provide an authentication token. Signing up is required because ngrok only give you tcp port tunnel after signing up. There is no cost or credit card required to sign up.4) in your terminal do ngrok tcp 3306. 3306 is the port that mysql runs on my local, you can do it with any other port as well.5) You will receive an address from step 4 such as this: tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:10117. This is the tunnel connection to your local machine. 0.tcp.ngrok.io is mapped to your localhost and port 10117 is mapped to your local port 3306. Now you can access your localhost port 3306 from anywhere using this address, including any docker container running on this machine. In your docker container(wherever it is), assuming you have mysql client already installed, do the following:mysql --host 0.tcp.ngrok.io --port 10117 -u rootYou will be able to log into your root account of your local machine from inside of the docker container!I\'ve blogged about this solution see more details here
