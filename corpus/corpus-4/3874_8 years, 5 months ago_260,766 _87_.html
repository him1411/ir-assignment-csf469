In IB\'s library, the introduction tells us that when the return key is pressed, the keyboard for UITextView will disappear. But actually the return key can only act as \'\\n\'. I can add a button and use [txtView resignFirstResponder] to hide the keyboard. But is there a way to add the action for the return key in keyboard so that I needn\'t add UIButton?UITextView does not have any methods which will be called when the user hits the return key. If you want the user to be able to add only one line of text, use a UITextField. Hitting the return and hiding the keyboard for a UITextView does not follow the interface guidelines.Even then if you want to do this, implement the textView:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText: method of UITextViewDelegate and in that check if the replacement text is \\n, hide the keyboard.There might be other ways but I am not aware of any.Figured I would post the snippet right here instead:Make sure you declare support for the UITextViewDelegate protocol.I know this has been answered already but I don\'t really like using the string literal for the newline so here is what I did.I know this has been answered a lot of times, but here are my two cents to the issue.I found the answers by samvermette and ribeto really useful, and also the comment by maxpower in the ribeto\'s answer. But there is a problem with those approaches. The problem that matt mentions in the samvermette\'s answer and it\'s that if the user wants to paste something with a line break inside it, the keyboard would hide without pasting anything.So my approach is a mixture of the three above mentioned solutions and only checking if the string entered is a new line when the length of the string is 1 so we make sure the user is typing instead of pasting.Here is what I have done:A more elegant way is to dismiss the keyboard when the user taps somewhere outside of the keyboard\'s frame.  First, set your ViewController\'s view to the class "UIControl" in the identity inspector in UIBuilder.  Control-drag the view into the ViewController\'s header file and link it as an action with the event as Touch Up Inside, such as:ViewController.hIn the main ViewController file, ViewController.m:You can require a double tap or long touch using similar techniques.  You may need to set your ViewController to be a UITextViewDelegate and connect the TextView to the ViewController.  This method works for both UITextView and UITextField.Source: Big Nerd RanchEDIT:  I\'d also like to add that if you are using a UIScrollView, the above technique may not work as easily through the Interface Builder.  In that case, you could use a UIGestureRecognizer and call the [[self view] endEditing:YES] method within it instead.  An example would be:When the user taps outside of the keyboard and does not tap an entry space, the keyboard will dismiss.Add this method in your view controller.Swift:This method also can be helpful for you:Also add  UITextViewDelegateDon\'t forget to confirm protocolIF you didn\'t add if([text isEqualToString:@"\\n"]) you can\'t editThere is another solution while using with uitextview,\nYou can add toolbar as InputAccessoryView in "textViewShouldBeginEditing", and from this toolbar\'s done button you can dismiss keyboard, the code for this is following:In viewDidLoadIn textviewdelegate methodIn action of Button Done which is in toolbar is following:Using navigation controller to host a bar to dismiss the keyboard:in the .h file:in the .m file:Just like matt comment to samvermette, I don\'t like the idea of detecting "\\n" either. The "return" key is there for a reason in UITextView, that is to go to next line of course. The best solution in my opinion is to mimic iPhone message app - which is to add toolbar (and button) on the keyboard. I got code from following blog post: http://www.iosdevnotes.com/2011/02/iphone-keyboard-toolbar/Steps:-Add toolbar to your XIB file - set the height to 460-Add toolbar button item (if not already added). If you need to right-align it, also add flexible bar button item to XIB, and move the toolbar button item-Create action that link your button item to resignFirstResponder as follow:-Then:Just solved this problem a different way.Control drag the button to the viewController.h file and create an action (Sent Event: Touch Up Inside) like : In ViewController.m should look like :Add an observer in viewDidLoadand then use the selector to check for "\\n"It does use "\\n" and not specifically check for a return key, but I think this is OK.UPDATESee ribto\'s answer below which uses [NSCharacterSet newlineCharacterSet] in place of \\nTry this ://You can use this ...Step 1. The first step is to make sure that you declare support for the UITextViewDelegate protocol. This is done in your header file, as example here is the header called EditorController.h:Step 2. Next you will need to register the controller as the UITextView\xe2\x80\x99s delegate. Continuing from the example above, here is how I have initialize the UITextView with EditorController as the delegate \xe2\x80\xa6Step 3. And now the final piece of the puzzle is to take action in response to the shouldCahngeTextInRange message as follows:swiftSwift CodeImplement UITextViewDelegate in your class / View like so:set the textView delegate to selfAnd then implement the following:EDIT\nI updated the code because it is never a good idea to change the user input in a textfield to for a workarround and not resetting the state after the hack code completed.You can also hide keyboard when touch in view screen:Swift answer:I used this code to change responder.Ok. Everyone has given answers with tricks but i think the right way to achieve this is byConnecting the following action to the "Did End On Exit" event in Interface Builder. \n(right-click the TextField and cntrl-drag from \'Did end on exit\' to the following method.The question asks how to do it with the return key but I think this could help someone with the intent to just make keyboard disappear when using UITextView:Call addToolBarForTextView() in the viewDidLoad or some other life cycle method.It seems that was the perfect solution for me. Cheers,MuratI found the answer by josebama to be the most complete and clean answer available in this thread. Below is the Swift 3 syntax for it: I know it\'s not the exact answer to this question, but I found this thread after hunting the internet down for an answer. I assume others share that feeling.This is my variance of the UITapGestureRecognizer which I find reliable and easy to use - just set the delegate of the TextView to the ViewController.Instead of ViewDidLoad I add the UITapGestureRecognizer when the TextView becomes active for editing:When I tap outside the TextView, the view ends editing mode and the UITapGestureRecognizer removes itself so I can continue interacting with other controls in the view.I hope this helps. It seems so obvious but I have never seen this solution anywhere on the web - am I doing something wrong?Don\'t forget to set the delegate for the textView - otherwise resignfirstresponder won\'t work.  Try this . For Xcode 6.4., Swift 1.2. :My hack for this :1- create a button covering the whole view;\n2- send it to the background of your view,\n3- change it\xc2\xb4s Type from "Round Rect" to "Custom" in the Attribute Inspector,\n4- create an action\n5- implement the action method:where _userInput is your TextField outlet
