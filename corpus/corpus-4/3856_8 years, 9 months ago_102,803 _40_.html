I\'ve got an enum like this:I got a property in my DataContext:And I got three RadioButtons in my WPF client.Now how do I bind the RadioButtons to the property for proper two-way-binding?You could use a more generic converterAnd in the XAML-Part you use:You can further simplify the accepted answer. Instead of typing out the enums as strings in xaml and doing more work in your converter than needed, you can explicitly pass in the enum value instead of a string representation, and as CrimsonX commented, errors get thrown at compile time rather than runtime:Then simplify the converter:ConverterParameter={x:Static local:YourClass+YourNestedEnumType.Enum1}Due to this Microsoft Connect Issue, however, the designer in VS2010 will no longer load stating "Type \'local:YourClass+YourNestedEnumType\' was not found.", but the project does compile and run successfully. Of course, you can avoid this issue if you are able move your enum type to the namespace directly.For the EnumToBooleanConverter answer:\nInstead of returning DependencyProperty.UnsetValue consider returning Binding.DoNothing for the case where the radio button IsChecked value becomes false.\nThe former indicates a problem (and might show the user a red rectangle or similar validation indicators) while the latter just indicates that nothing should be done, which is what is wanted in that case.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.ivalueconverter.convertback.aspx\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.binding.donothing.aspxI would use the RadioButtons in a ListBox, and then bind to the SelectedValue.This is an older thread about this topic, but the base idea should be the same: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wpf/thread/323d067a-efef-4c9f-8d99-fecf45522395/Extended the great ideas above with the ability to bind radio buttons to any type (enumeration, Boolean, string, integer, etc.) and provided working sample code here:http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/720497/Binding-Radio-Buttons-to-a-Single-PropertyFor UWP, it is not so simple: You must jump through an extra hoop to pass a  field value as a parameter.Example 1Valid for both WPF and UWP.Example 2Valid for both WPF and UWP.Example 3Valid only for WPF!UWP doesn\'t support x:Static so Example 3 is out of the question; assuming you go with Example 1, the result is more verbose code. Example 2 is slightly better, but still not ideal.SolutionThen, for each type you wish to support, define a converter that boxes the enum type.The reason it must be boxed is because there\'s seemingly no way to reference the type in the ConvertBack method; the boxing takes care of that. If you go with either of the first two examples, you can just reference the parameter type, eliminating the need to inherit from a boxed class; if you wish to do it all in one line and with least verbosity possible, the latter solution is ideal.Usage resembles Example 2, but is, in fact, less verbose.The downside is you must define a converter for each type you wish to support. Based on the EnumToBooleanConverter from Scott.\nI noticed that the ConvertBack method doesn\'t work on the Enum with flags code.I\'ve tried the following code:The only thing that I can\'t get to work is to do a cast from int to targetType so I made it hardcoded to NavigationProjectDates, the enum that I use. And, targetType == NavigationProjectDates...Edit for more generic Flags Enum converter:
