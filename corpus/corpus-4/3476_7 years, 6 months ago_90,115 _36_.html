Is there any NoSQL database as simple as SQLite? I\'m looking for a lightweight database to persist a small set of data for a simple desktop application. I still can use SQLite but prefer a more OO approach since my app doesn\'t handle much data.UnQLite is a in-process software library which implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional NoSQL database engine.I think Berkeley DB is the classic choice here.Berkeley DB (BDB) is a software library that provides a high-performance embedded database for key/value data. Berkeley DB is written in C with API bindings for C++, C#, PHP, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Smalltalk, and many other programming languages. BDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, and supports multiple data items for a single key. Berkeley DB is not a relational database.You might also want to keep an eye on UnQL from the developers of CouchDB and SQLite.Tokyo Cabinet and it\'s successor Kyoto Cabinet are best.Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and a value. Each key must be unique within a database. There is neither concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.I would like to suggest CouchbaseLite. It is a pretty lightweight NoSQL database that can be used in an embedded fashion, on mobile, and even provides event handling, views, revisions, synchronization, conflict resolution, filtering, subscriptions, and more.I found UnQLite a couple of days ago, but it doesn\'t seem to support indexes and has no adapters.Sounds like a job for y_serial ;-)Here\'s the description: "Serialization + persistance :: in a few lines of code, compress and annotate Python objects into SQLite; then later retrieve them chronologically by keywords without any SQL. Most useful "standard" module for a database to store schema-less data."See http://yserial.sourceforge.net/ for more details.RavenDB is an interesting option here (fair disclosure - I\'ve only played with it a bit - have not used it in a real project yet).The feature I find most interesting is that it automatically maps your object model to the persistent store.  In the RDMS world, the only tool that does this well (as far as I know) is Fluent NHibernate.  Automapping can be a huge time saver during development, especially if you have a complicated object model, or rapidly changing requirements.I\'m personally looking for something that works with Python 3. I see the accepted answer is UnQLite, where the Python bindings are not currently available for Python 3.However, TinyDB looks to be a good alternative.Technically if you don\'t need SQL like functionality to select specific items you could use simple serialization and save each object as separate file.For example using C# lang + psuedo to shorten One object one document on the file system, or you can make one big payload object to hold all your data and save into one file, just consider app workload if you use lots of data. Now, answering "Is there any NoSql database as simple as SQLite" I don\'t know thus I\'m here asking same question :) but really for simple config file, or some few objects or lists, local json file should be just enough.EDIT: this could be promissing http://unqlite.org/"UnQLite is a in-process software library which implements a\n  self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional NoSQL\n  database engine. UnQLite is a document store database similar to\n  MongoDB, Redis, CouchDB etc. as well a standard Key/Value store\n  similar to BerkeleyDB, LevelDB, etc."Under some circumstances (if you don\'t need/have some requisites as indexes) you can use the filesystem itself as a DB: filename/path as key and file contents as value. JSON is memory efficient, so you can use a parser to serialize/unserialize data.Make sure that you don\'t store too much files (thousands) under the same folder (split files into various folders with a hash).The real problem of this solution (in addition to the lack of some features) is that file records will be stored into 4KB blocks, so a file of 10 bytes will use 4KB, a file of 4097 bytes will use 8KB and so on (at least on most filesystems), so for large quantities of small records is not very disk-efficient.The benefits: is fast, lightweight, because uses much less ram, and no interprocess connector bottleneck is added, is proved and transparently-OS optimized thru the ram r/w cache. You can use locks and you can even distribute via remote-mount.Finally I would avoid using this solution if your production platform is a Windows machine, however is possible as well.You can check some oodb (object-oriented database)Another solution is LevelDB. The homepage says:LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that\n  provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.stsdb is an easy to use one.\nall you need to use is client lib and a db file which it can create.I use it in a c#/wpf app. But it\'s not suitable for development stage. Because you can\'t modify already stored models.But it\'s easy, fast and small. So many pros makes it worthyYou can try rabaDB. It\'s a python NoSQL ORM for SQLite with a very light interface.Friendly is sort of a NOSQL database that uses Ruby + SQLite as its backend. It\'s kind of a hack, but it\'s also kind of nice. I wrote a sample Sinatra app that demonstrates it here.
