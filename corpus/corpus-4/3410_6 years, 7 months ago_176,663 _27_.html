What\'s the difference between the text data type and the character varying (varchar) data types?According to the documentationIf character varying is used without length specifier, the type accepts strings of any size. The latter is a PostgreSQL extension.andIn addition, PostgreSQL provides the text type, which stores strings of any length. Although the type text is not in the SQL standard, several other SQL database management systems have it as well.So what\'s the difference?There is no difference, under the hood it\'s all varlena (variable length array).Check this article from Depesz: http://www.depesz.com/index.php/2010/03/02/charx-vs-varcharx-vs-varchar-vs-text/A couple of highlights:To sum it all up:The article does detailed testing to show that the performance of inserts and selects for all 4 data types are similar. It also takes a detailed look at alternate ways on constraining the length when needed. Function based constraints or domains provide the advantage of instant increase of the length constraint, and on the basis that decreasing a string length constraint is rare, depesz concludes that one of them is usually the best choice for a length limit.As "Character Types" in the documentation points out, varchar(n), char(n), and text are all stored the same way. The only difference is extra cycles are needed to check the length, if one is given, and the extra space and time required if padding is needed for char(n).However, when you only need to store a single character, there is a slight performance advantage to using the special type "char" (keep the double-quotes \xe2\x80\x94 they\'re part of the type name). You get faster access to the field, and there is no overhead to store the length.I just made a table of 1,000,000 random "char" chosen from the lower-case alphabet. A query to get a frequency distribution (select count(*), field ... group by field) takes about 650 milliseconds, vs about 760 on the same data using a text field.On PostgreSQL manualI usually use textReferences: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-character.htmlAnd using "pure SQL" benchmarks (without any external script)use any string_generator with UTF8main benchmarks:2.1. INSERT2.2. SELECT comparing and countingPrepare specific test (examples)Perform a basic test:And other tests,... And use EXPLAIN ANALYZE. My results: in average, all the same.Somewhat OT: If you\'re using Rails, the standard formatting of webpages may be different. For data entry forms text boxes are scrollable, but character varying (Rails string) boxes are one-line. Show views are as long as needed.
