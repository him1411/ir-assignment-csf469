OK here\'s what I would like: in the Eclipse package explorer, I see the following: (dot represents a clickable arrow that I can use to expand the folder)Long story short, I want to have many packages, each with many subpackages, in a source folder (and several source folders, so making more won\'t solve the problem)--so on the order of a couple hundred packages per source folder--ten to twenty packages each with fifteen subpackages. Therefore, I want the hierarchy to look like this:so I can open or close a package and see a list of subpackages instead of having package and subpackage all at the same level in the hierarchy--which again makes far too many packages simultaneously displayed. Note this is not a question about filesystem; the file system works fine as far as I can tell--it is only a question about the visual display in the Eclipse package explorer.So: is there a way to add levels to the hierarchy? Thanks!!
