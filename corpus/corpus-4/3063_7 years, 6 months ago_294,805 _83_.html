It has to be run for each session.This generally means you haven\'t properly set up locales on your Linux box.  On Debian or Ubuntu, that means you need to doSee also man locale-gen.I know this answer is not much related to the question, but I just want to answer so the other guys having same problem with Git can resolve it.I was getting the same warning when working with Git, and it annoys me a lot. Here is what I was gettingIt is simple fix in Ubuntu. You have to generate the Locales from scratch, running the following commands from the command line:This should create the locales and then re-configure them.I am now using this:Then log out of SSH session and log in again.Old answer:Only this helped me:on Debian after much searching this did the trick.first:then:and the famous:This rids the system of locales, then re-installs locales and downgrades libc6 from 2.19 to 2.13 which is the issue.
