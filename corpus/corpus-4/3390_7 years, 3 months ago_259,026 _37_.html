Can anybody please guide me regarding how to launch my android application from the android browser? Use an <intent-filter> with a <data> element. For example, to handle all links to twitter.com, you\'d put this inside your <activity> in your AndroidManifest.xml:Then, when the user clicks on a link to twitter in the browser, they will be asked what application to use in order to complete the action: the browser or your application.Of course, if you want to provide tight integration between your website and your app, you can define your own scheme:Then, in your web app you can put links like:And when the user clicks it, your app will be launched automatically (because it will probably be the only one that can handle my.special.scheme:// type of uris). The only downside to this is that if the user doesn\'t have the app installed, they\'ll get a nasty error. And I\'m not sure there\'s any way to check.Edit: To answer your question, you can use getIntent().getData() which returns a Uri object. You can then use Uri.* methods to extract the data you need. For example, let\'s say the user clicked on a link to http://twitter.com/status/1234:You can do the above anywhere in your Activity, but you\'re probably going to want to do it in onCreate(). You can also use params.size() to get the number of path segments in the Uri. Look to javadoc or the android developer website for other Uri methods you can use to extract specific parts.Please see my comment here: Make a link in the Android browser start up my app?We strongly discourage people from using their own schemes, unless they are defining a new world-wide internet scheme.All above answers didn\'t work for me with CHROME as of 28 Jan 2014my App launched properly from http://example.com/someresource/ links from apps like hangouts, gmail etc but not from within chrome browser.to solve this, so that it launches properly from CHROME you have to set intent filter like this note the pathPrefix elementyour app will now appear inside activity picker whenever user requests http://example.com/someresource/ pattern from chrome browser by clicking a link from google search results or any other websiteIn my case I had to set two categories for the <intent-filter> and then it worked:There should also be <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/> added to the intent filter to make the activity recognized properly from the link.For example, You have next things:A link to open your app: http://example.comThe package name of your app: com.example.mypackageThen you need to do next:1) Add an intent filter to your Activity\n (Can be any activity you want. For more info check the documentation).2) Create a HTML file to test the link or use this methods.3)  Use Mobile Chrome to test4) That\'s it.And its not necessary to publish app in market to test deep linking =)Also, for more information, check documentation and useful presentation.The following link gives information on launching the app (if installed) directly from browser. Otherwise it directly opens up the app in play store so that user can seamlessly download.https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/intentsYeah, Chrome searches instead of looking for scheme. If you want to launch your App through URI scheme, use this cool utility App on the Play store. It saved my day :)\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naosim.urlschemesenderPlease note if your icon is disappear from android launcher when you implement this feature, than you have to split intent-filter.Felix\'s approach to handling deep links is the typical approach to handling deep links. I would also suggest checking out this library to handle the routing and parsing of your deep links:https://github.com/airbnb/DeepLinkDispatchYou can use annotations to register your Activity for a particular deep link URI, and it will extract out the parameters for you without having to do the usual rigmarole of getting the path segments, matching it, etc. You could simply annotate and activity like this:example.php:Hey I got the solution. I did not set the category as "Default". Also I was using the Main activity for the intent Data. Now i am using a different activity for the intent data. Thanks for the help. :) You need to add a pseudo-hostname to the CALLBACK_URL  \'app://\' doesn\'t make sense as a URL and cannot be parsed.
