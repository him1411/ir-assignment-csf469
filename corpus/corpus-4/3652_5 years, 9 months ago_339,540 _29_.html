I am using the Twitter Bootstrap lib on a new project and I want for part of the page to refresh and retrieve the latest json data on modal close. I dont see this anywhere in the documentation can someone point it out to me or suggest a solution.Two problems with using the documented methodsI attach a "hide" class to the modal already so it does not display on page load so that would load twiceeven if I remove the hide class and set the element id to display:none and add console.log("THE MODAL CLOSED"); to the function above when I hit close nothing happens.See getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-eventsSee getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals \xe2\x86\x92 EventsFor Bootstrap v3.0, you just need to bind an event like this:See the Modal Usage section of the docs here:http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-usageSee this JsFiddle for a working example:http://jsfiddle.net/kRLQ4/439/Starting Bootstrap 3 (edit: still the same in Bootstrap 4) there are 2 instances in which you can fire up events, being: Ref: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#js-eventsIn stead of "live" you need to use "on" event, but assign it to the document object:Use:Bootstrap provide events that you can hook into modal, like if you want to fire a event when the modal has finished being hidden from the user you can use hidden.bs.modal event\nlike thisCheck a working fiddle here read more about modal methods and events here in DocumentationI\'ve seen many answers regarding the bootstrap events such as hide.bs.modal which triggers when the modal closes.There\'s a problem with those events: any popups in the modal (popovers, tooltips, etc) will trigger that event.There is another way to catch the event when a modal closes.Bootstrap uses the in class when the modal is open.\nIt is very important to use the hidden event since the class in is still defined when the event hideis triggered.This solution will not work in IE8 since IE8 does not support the Jquery :not() selector.I\'m jumping in super late here, but for people using Bootstrap modals with React I\'ve been using MutationObserver to detect changes in a modal\'s visibility and adjusting the state accordingly - this method could be applied to run any function when the modal is closed: For those wondering about modern browser support, CanIUse has MutationObserver\'s coverage at around 87%Hope that helps someone :)Cheers, JakeI was having the same issues as some withYou need to place this at the bottom of the page, placing it at the top never fires the event.
