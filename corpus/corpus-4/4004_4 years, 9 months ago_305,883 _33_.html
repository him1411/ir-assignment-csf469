Let\'s say I have an array of four objects:Is there a way that I can get the third object ({a: 5, b: 6}) by the value of the property b for example without a for...in loop?See the MDN Docs on Array.prototype.filter()I don\'t know why you are against a for loop (presumably you meant a for loop, not specifically for..in), they are fast and easy to read. Anyhow, here\'s some options.For loop:.filter.forEachIf, on the other hand you really did mean for..in and want to find an object with any property with a value of 6, then you must use for..in unless you pass the names to check. e.g.From MDN:The find() method returns a value in the array, if an element in the array satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise undefined is returned.Side note: methods like find() and arrow functions are not supported by all browsers, but it doesn\'t mean that you can\'t use these features right now. Just use Babel\xe2\x80\x94it transforms ES6 code into ES5.Using underscore.js:If I understand correctly, you want to find the object in the array whose b property is 6?Or if you were using underscore:It looks like in the ECMAScript 6 proposal there are the Array methods find() and findIndex(). MDN also offers polyfills which you can include to get the functionality of these across all browsers.find():findIndex():Try Array filter method for filter the array of objects with property.using array filter method:using for in loop :Working fiddle : https://jsfiddle.net/uq9n9g77/How about using _.find(collection, [predicate=_.identity], [fromIndex=0]) of lo-dash to get object from array of objects by object property value. You could do something like this: Arguments: ReturnsIn terms of performance, _.find() is faster as it only pulls the first object with property {\'b\': 6}, on the other hand, if suppose your array contains multiple objects with matching set of properties (key:value), then you should consider using _.filter() method. So in your case, as your array has a single object with this property, I would use _.find(). If you are looking for a single result, rather than an array, may I suggest reduce? Here is a solution in plain \'ole javascript that returns a matching object if one exists, or null if not.You can use the Array.filter method: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filterTo get first object from array of objects by a specific property value:Using find with bind to pass specific key values to a callback function. See this documentation https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Object/values\nExample :  to access the third object, use: jsObjects[2];\nto access the third object b value, use: jsObjects[2].b;
