What\'s the difference between a REST system and a system that is RESTful?From a few things I\'ve read most so called REST services are actually RESTful services. So what is the difference between the two.  Representational state transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture. As described in a dissertation by Roy Fielding, REST is an "architectural style" that basically exploits the existing technology and protocols of the Web.RESTful is typically used to refer to web services implementing such an architecture. "REST" is an architectural paradigm. "RESTful" describes using that paradigm.As Jason said in the comments, RESTful is just used as an adjective describing something that respects the REST constraints. REST stands for representational state transfer. That means that state itself is not transferred but a mere representation of it is. The most common example is a pure HTML server based app (no javascript). The browser knows nothing about the application itself but through links and resources, the server is able transfer the state of the application to the browser. Where a button would normally change a state variable (e.g. page open) in a regular windows application, in the browser you have a link that represents such a state change.The idea is to use hypermedia. And perhaps to create new hypermedia types. Potentially we can expand the browser with javascript/AJAX and create new custom hypermedia types. And we would have a true REST application.This is my short version of what REST stands for, the problem is that it is hard to implement. I personally say RESTful, when I want to make reference to the REST principles but I know I am not really implementing the whole concept of REST. We don\'t really say SOAPful, because you either use SOAP or not. I think most people don\'t do REST the way it was envisioned by it\'s creator Roy Fielding, we actually implement RESTful or RESTlike architectures. You can see his dissertation, and you will find the REST acronym but not the word RESTful.REST based Services/Architecture VC RESTFUL Services/ArchitectureTo differentiate or compare these 2, you should know what is REST. REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is basically an architectural style of development having some principles....) It should be stateless.) It should access all the resources from the server using only URI.) It does not have inbuilt encryption.) It does not have session.) It uses one and only one protocol that is HTTP.) For performing CRUD operations, it should use HTTP verbs such as get, post, put and delete.) It should return the result only in the form of JSON or XML,atom, OData etc. (light weight data )REST based services follow some of the above principles and not all, where as RESTFUL means it follows all the above principles.It is similar to the concept of Object based languages (Its support all the OOPS concepts, example are C++, C#) and Object oriented languages (It supports some of the OOPs features, such as JavaScript, VB). Examples are ASP Dot NET MVC 4 is \'REST-Based\' and Microsoft WEB API are \'RESTFul\'. MVC supports only some of the above REST principles whereas WEBAPI supports all the above REST Principles. MVC only supports the following from the REST API.) We can access the resource using URI.) It supports the HTTP verb to access the resource from server.) It can return the results in the form of JSON, XML, that is the HTTPResponse. But at the same time in MVC.) We can use the session.) We can make it stateful.) We can return video or image from the controller action method which basically violates the REST principles That is why MVC is REST-Based whereas WEBAPI supports all the above principles and is RESTFul.REST is an style of software architecture for distributed softwareConforming to the REST constraints is referred to as being \xe2\x80\x98RESTful\xe2\x80\x99.Very used today to build web services as an alternative to SOAP.Here you have some links to checkhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\nhttp://www.computerworld.com/s/article/297424/Representational_State_Transfer_REST_\nhttp://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-restful/thanks for the answers.\nRead this article by Alex Rodriguez which suggests that a RESTful web service has 4 basic characteristics which are:Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web. The term Representational State Transfer was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding1[2] in his doctoral dissertation. Fielding is one of the principal authors of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specification versions 1.0 and 1.1.\nConforming to the REST constraints is referred to as being \xe2\x80\x98RESTful\xe2\x80\x99. Source:WikipediaWeb services are essentially web sites whose content is consumed by computer programs, not people.  REST is a set of architectural principles that stipulate that web services should maximally leverage HTTP and other web standards, so that programs gain all the good stuff that people already can get out of the web.  REST is often contrasted with SOAP web services, and other "remote procedure call" oriented web services.Stefan Tilkov\'s presentations on REST at Parleys.com are quite good, especially this one.For a book, you can\'t get any better than Richardson and Ruby\'s Restful Web Services.A service based on REST is called a "RESTful service".Source I rely on posting that: Dr.Dobbs Archivehttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htmThis is the original document that created the idea of RESTful networked applications. Cited in references of the REST wikipedia article. He also co-authored the HTTP RFC.Okay, let me make it handy for you to remember the concepts.  REST is an architectural dance and RESTful is the dancer (follows ALL steps of REST dance)JPA is a specificational dance and Hibernate is one of the dancer (follow all steps of JPA dance + some additional moves). SLF4J is a specificational dance and SLF4J-Simple is one of the dancer.
