What are best practices for using Git source control with Unity 3D, particularly in dealing with the binary nature of Unity 3D projects? Please describe the workflow, what paths would be included in .gitignore, what settings should be set in Unity and/or the project, and any other special things that should be noted.Note: I realize that using the Asset Server is the Unity-recommended way, but I would like to use Git for a variety of reasons. Please no answers that state or argue that I should just use the Asset Server. The Asset Server really isn\'t an option for me.The following is an excerpt from my personal blog .Update Oct 2015: GitHub has since released a plugin for Git called Git LFS that directly deals with the below problem. You can now easily and efficiently version large binary files!Git can work fine with 3D games out of the box. However the main caveat here is that versioning large (>5Â MB) media files can be a problem over the long term as your commit history bloats. We have solved this potential issue in our projects by only versioning the binary asset when it is considered final. Our 3D artists use Dropbox to work on WIP assets, both for the reason above and because it\'s much faster and simpler (not many artists will actively want to use Git!). Your Git workflow is very much something you need to decide for yourself given your own experiences as a team and how you work together. However. I would strongly recommend the appropriately named Git Flow methodology as described by the original author here.I won\'t go into too much depth here on how the methodology works as the author describes it perfectly and in quite few words too so it\'s easy to get through. I have been using with my team for awhile now, and it\'s the best workflow we\'ve tried so far.This is really a personal preference here as there are quite a few options in terms of Git GUI or whether to use a GUI at all. But I would like to suggest the free SourceTree application as it plugs in perfectly with the Git Flow extension. Read the SourceTree tutorial here on implementing the Git Flow methodology in their application.For an up to date version checkout Github maintained Unity.gitignore file without OS specifics.For versions of Unity 3D v4.3 and up:One of the few major annoyances one has with using Git with Unity3D projects is that Git doesn\'t care about directories and will happily leave empty directories around after removing files from them. Unity3D will make *.meta files for these directories and can cause a bit of a battle between team members when Git commits keep adding and removing these meta files.Add this Git post-merge hook to the /.git/hooks/ folder for repositories with Unity3D projects in them. After any Git pull/merge, it will look at what files have been removed, check if the directory it existed in is empty, and if so delete it.In Unity 4.3 you also had to enable External option from preferences, but since Unity 4.5 they dropped option for that, so full setup process looks like:Also our team is using a bit more extended .gitignore file:Note that the only folders you need to keep under source control are Assets and ProjectSettings.More information about keeping Unity Project under source control you can find in this post.What is GIT? Git is a free and open source  distributed version control system (SCM) developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 ( Linux OS founder). It is created to control everything rom small to large projects with speed and efficiency. Leading companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft uses GIT everyday.If you want to learn more about GIT check this Quick tutorial,First of all make sure you have your Git environment set up.You need to set up both your local environment and a Git repository (I prefer Github.com).GIT client application Mac/WindowsFor GIT gui client application i recommended you to go with Github.com,GitHub is the place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over five million people use GitHub to build amazing things together.Unity3d settings You need to do these settings Switch to Visible Meta Files in Edit \xe2\x86\x92 Project Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Editor \xe2\x86\x92 Version Control Mode.Enable External option in Unity \xe2\x86\x92 Preferences \xe2\x86\x92 Packages \xe2\x86\x92 Repository  Switch to Force Text in Edit \xe2\x86\x92 Project Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Editor \xe2\x86\x92 Asset Serialization Mode.Source:\nUsing Git With 3D Games Source ControlTo add to everything stated, it it also ideal to use git lfs with Unity. I have been using this since it came out and it has had no trouble.You will want to add this .gitattributes next to your .gitignore fileThat is my rolling file list. If you use additional binary files not lists, add them.I also have files configured to use yamlmerge, you would need to set this up. You can read about it here: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SmartMerge.htmlI thought that I might post a simpler .gitignore for anyone that is interested:Edit -> Project Settings -> EditorSet Version Control to meta files. Set Asset Serialization to force text.I think this is what you want.Only the Assets and ProjectSettings folders need to be under git version control.You can make a gitignore like this.Unity also Provide its own Source version control. before unity5 it was unityAsset Server but now its depreciated. and launch a new SVN control system called unity collaborate.but the main problem using unity and any SVN is committing and merging scene . but Non of svn give us way to solve this kind of conflicts or merge scene . so depend upon you which SVN you are familiar with . I am using SmartSVN tool on Mac . and turtle on windows .
