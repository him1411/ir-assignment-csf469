I have a few static pages that are just pure HTML, that we display when the server goes down. How can I put a favicon that I made (it\'s 16x16px and it\'s sitting in the same directory as the HTML file; it\'s called favicon.ico) as the "tab" icon as it were. I have read up on Wikipedia and looked at a few tutorials and have implemented the following:But it still doesn\'t want to work. I am using Chrome to test the sites. According to Wikipedia .ico is the best pic format that runs on all browser types.UpdateI could not get this to work locally although the code checks out it will only really work properly once the server started serving the site. Just try pushing it up to the server and refresh your cache and it should work fine.you can make a 16x16 png and useMost browsers will pick up favicon.ico from the root directory of the site without needing to be told; but they don\'t always update it with a new one right away.However, I usually go for the second of your examples:Actually, to make your favicon work in all browsers, you must have more than 10 images in the correct sizes and formats.I created an App (faviconit.com) so people don\xc2\xb4t have to create all these images and the correct tags by hand.Hope you like it.The following works for me...Convert your image file to Base64 string with a tool like this and then replace the YourBase64StringHere placeholder in the below snippet with your string and put the line in your HTML head section:This will work 100% in browsers.If the favicon is a png type image, it\'ll not work in older versions of Chrome. However it\'ll work just fine in FireFox. Also, don\'t forget to clear your browser cache while working on such things. Many a times, code is just fine, but cache is the real culprit.As recommended by W3.org, you can use the rel attribute to achieve this.Example:I know its older post but still posting for someone like me.\n This worked for meput your favicon icon on root directory..as an additional note that may help someone some day.You can not echo anything to the page before:will not load icoworks fineI used convert -resize 16x16 img.png favicon.ico (on linux konsole) to convert my image, and \nadd <link rel="icon" href="images/favicon.ico" type="image/png" sizes="16x16"> to my header and everything work perfect.If you add the favicon into the root/images folder with the name favicon.ico browser will automatically understand and get it as favicon.I tested and worked.\nyour link must be www.website.com/images/favicon.icoFor more information look this answer:Do you have to include <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />?Try to use the <link rel="icon" type="image/ico" href="images/favi.png"/>This worked for me
