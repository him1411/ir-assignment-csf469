I want to get longitude and latitude in Android emulator for testing.Can any one guide me how to achieve this?How do I set the location of the emulator to a test position?You can connect to the Emulator via Telnet. You then have a Emulator console that lets you enter certain data like geo fixes, network etc. How to use the console is extensively explained here.\nTo connect to the console open a command line and typeYou then can use the geo command to set a latitude, longitude and if needed altitude on the device that is passed to all programs using the gps location provider. See the link above for further instructions. The specific command to run in the console isI found this site useful for finding a realistic lat/lng: http://itouchmap.com/latlong.htmlIf you need more then one coordinate you can use a kml file with a route as well it is a little bit described in this article. I can\'t find a better source at the moment.I was looking for a better way to set the emulator\'s GPS coordinates than using geo fix and manually determining the specific latitude and longitude coordinates.Unable to find anything, I put together a little program that uses GWT and the Google Maps API to launch a browser-based map tool to set the GPS location in the emulator:android-gps-emulatorHopefully it can be of use to help others who will undoubtedly stumble across this difficulty/question as well.If you\'re using Eclipse, go to Window->Open Perspective->DDMS, then type one in Location Controls and hit Send.For Android Studio users: run the emulator,Then, go to Tools -> Android ->Android device monitoropen the Emulator Control Tab, and use the location controls group.Assuming you\'ve got a mapview set up and running:You\'ll need the following permission in your manifest:And to send mock coordinates to the emulator from Eclipse, Go to the "Window" menu, select "Show View" > "Other" > "Emulator control", and you can send coordinates from the emulator control pane that appears.For the new emulator:http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html#extendedBasically, click on the three dots button in the emulator controls (to the right of the emulator) and it will open up a menu which will allow you to control the emulator including location1. Android Studio users.After running the emulator goto Tools->Android->Android device monitorClick the Emulator Control Tab change from the location controls group.2. Eclipse users.First In Eclipse In Menu Select "Window" then Select "Open Perspective" then Select "DDMS".\ni.e Window->Open Prespective->DDMS.You will see on Left Side Devices Panel and on Right Side you will see different tabs. \nSelect "Emulator Control" Tab.At bottom you will see Location Controls Panel.\nSelect "Manual" Tab.Enter Longitude and Latitude in Textboxs then Click Send Button.\nIt will send the position to you emulator and the application.3. Using telnet.In the run command type this.If you are not using windows you can use any telnet client.After connecting with telnet use the following command to send your position to emulator.4. Use the browser based Google maps toolThere is a program that uses GWT and the Google Maps API to launch a browser-based map tool to set the GPS location in the emulator:android-gps-emulatorUsing the "geo" command in the emulator consoleTo send mock location data from the command line:Launch your application in the Android emulator and open a terminal/console in your SDK\'s /tools directory.Connect to the emulator console:telnet localhost 5555 (Replace 5555 with whatever port your emulator is running on)Send the location data:\n      * geo fix to send a fixed geo-location.This command accepts a longitude and latitude in decimal degrees, and an optional altitude in meters. For example:I wrote a python script to push gps locations to the emulator via telnet. It defines a source and a destination location. There is also a time offset which lets you control how long coordinates will be pushed to the device. One location is beeing pushed once a second.In the example below the script moves from Berlin to Hamburg in 120 seconds. One step/gps location per second with random distances. I use eclipse plug DDMS function to send GPS.\nIn Mac, Linux or Cygwin:That will put you in Mexico City. Change your longitude/latitude/altitude accordingly. That should be enough if you are not interested in nmea. See Obtaining User LocationLook under Providing Mock Location Data. You will find the solution for it.First go in DDMS section in your eclipse \nThan open emulator Control ....\n                             Go To Manual Section\n                                           set lat and long and then press Send Button In Linux where communication ports are blocked. navigate the terminal to platform-tools folder inside android sdk and fire this command:I was trying to set the geo fix through adb for many points and could not get my app to see any GPS data.  But when I tried opening DDMS, selecting my app\'s process and sending coordinates through the emulator control tab it worked right away.Dalvik Debug Monitor > Select Emulator > Emulator Control Tab > Location Controls. DDMS -- android_sdk/tools/ddms OR android_sdk/tools/monitorIf you are using eclipse then using Emulator controller you can manually set latitude and longitude and run your map based  app in emulatorIf you\'re using Android Studio (1.3):No one here mentioned the built in solution of the emulator itself, so for future visitors, I\'d like to share it with visuals.First, run your Android Emulator and click on the menu button (3 dots) shown below:Then from the left pane, select Location and change the coordinates according to your needs. After pressing Send button, changes will immediately take effect (I recommend you to open up Google Maps for better understanding).Android Studio Version: 2.3.3If the above solutions don\'t work. Try this:Inside your android Manifest.xml, add the following two links OUTSIDE of the application tag, but inside your manifest tag of courseI was unable to get a GPS fix on the emulator when emulator was running Android image without Google APIs. As soon as I changed the image to contain Google APIs all of the here mentioned ways to get a GPS fix worked.Make sure you select an image with Google APIs when creating AVD.For a project of my own, I developed an online service which can provide simulated location to the Android emulator.  It uses geo nmea rather than geo fix which allows it to set speed, course, precise time etc. in addition to just lat/lon.The service requires the nc (netcat) command line utility and nothing else.http://www.kisstech.ch/nmea/You can use an emulator like genymotion which gives you the flexibility to emulate your present GPS location, etc.There is a plugin for Android Studio called \xe2\x80\x9cMock Location Plugin\xe2\x80\x9d. \nYou can emulate multiple points with this plugin.\nYou can find a detailed manual of use in this link: Android Studio. Simulate multiple GPS points with Mock Location PluginThe following solution worked for me - open command line and write:Just make Alberto Gaona\'s answer into one line5554 is the emulator port number shown in adb devices.It would have been better if adb emu work.The already mentioned multiple times answer to use the shell command "geo fix..." is the correct answer.\nBut in case you use LocationClient.getLastLocation() to retrieve your data it is worth to mention that it will not work at first. The LocationClient class uses the Google Play Service to retrieve the coordinates. \nFor me this started working after running the emulators maps app once. During the first start you are asked to allow google apps access to your location, which I guess does the trick.In eclipse:You may have to drag the DDMS window down.\n\'Location Controls\' is located under \'Telephony Actions\' and may be hidden by a normally sized console view ( the bar with console, LogCat etc may be covering it!)~Can\'t comment yet, so updating @ectomorphs answer here, which when telneting now requires to have an auth token. In linux that\'s under /home/username/.emulator_console_auth_tokenFrom a shell script one can set the coorinate like soI have made a little script similar to one of the previous answers, but using expect instead of python - because it is a bit simpler (expect was invented for this).Exemple usage: sendloc 5554 2.35607 48.8263
