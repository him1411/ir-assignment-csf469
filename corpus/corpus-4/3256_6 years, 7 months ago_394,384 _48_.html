I am working on a form layout for a Login Activity in my Android App. The image below is how I want it to look like:I was able to achieve this layout with the following XML. The problem is, it\'s a bit hackish. I had to hard-code a width for the host EditText. Specifically, I had to specify:I\'d really like to give a percentage width to the host and port EditText\'s . (Something like 80% for the host, 20% for the port.) Is this possible? The following XML works on my Droid, but it doesn\'t seem to work for all screens. I would really like a more robust solution. You are looking for the android:layout_weight attribute. It will allow you to use percentages to define your layout.In the following example, the left button uses 70% of the space, and the right button 30%.It works the same with any kind of View, you can replace the buttons with some EditText to fit your needs.Be sure to set the layout_width to 0dp or your views may not be scaled properly.Note that the weight sum doesn\'t have to equal 1, I just find it easier to read like this. You can set the first weight to 7 and the second to 3 and it will give the same result.This does not quite answer the original question, which was for a 70/30 split, but in the special case of a 50/50 split between the components there is a way: place an invisible strut at the center and use it to position the two components of interest.As this is a pretty common case, this solution is more than a curiosity. It is a bit of a hack but an efficient one because the empty, zero-sized strut should cost very little.In general, though, it\'s best not to expect too much from the stock Android layouts...As pointed by @EmJiHash PercentRelativeLayout  is deprecated in  API level 26.0.0Below quoting google comment:This class was deprecated in API level 26.0.0.\n  consider using ConstraintLayout and associated layouts instead. The following shows how to replicate the functionality of percentage layouts with a ConstraintLayoutGoogle introduced new API called android.support.percentThen you can just specify percentage to take by viewAdd compile dependency like in that, PercentRelativeLayout is what we can do a percentage wise  layoutYou cannot use percentages to define the dimensions of a View inside a RelativeLayout. The best ways to do it is to use LinearLayout and weights, or a custom Layout.You can have a look at the new percent support library. docssampleYou can use PercentRelativeLayout, It is a recent undocumented addition to the Design Support Library, enables the ability to specify not only elements relative to each other but also the total percentage of available space.Subclass of RelativeLayout that supports percentage based dimensions\n  and margins. You can specify dimension or a margin of child by using\n  attributes with "Percent" suffix.The Percent package provides APIs to support adding and managing percentage based dimensions in your app.To use, you need to add this library to your Gradle dependency list:I have solved this creating a custom View:This is invisible strut I can use to align other views within RelativeLayout.Google introduced new API called android.support.percent1)PercentRelativeLayout2)PercentFrameLayoutAdd compile dependency likeYou can specify dimension in percentage so get both benefit of RelativeLayout and percentagePercentRelativeLayout is deprecated from Revision 26.0.0 of support Library. Google introduced new Layout called ConstraintLayout.Add the library as a dependency in your module-level build.gradle    file:just add in a layout file:ConstraintsConstraints help you keep widgets aligned. You can use anchors, such as the constraint handles shown below, to determine alignment rules between various widgets.You can learn more from the official doc.You can accomplish this via layout weights.  A weight dictates how the unclaimed portions of the screen are divided up.  Give each EditText a layout_width of 0, and some proportional weight.  I.e., give one a weight of 2, and the other a weight of 1 if you want the first to take up twice as much space.Interestingly enough, building on the answer from @olefevre, one can not only do 50/50 layouts with "invisible struts", but all sorts of layouts involving powers of two.For example, here is a layout that cuts the width into four equal parts (actually three, with weights of 1, 1, 2):Just put your two textviews host and port in an independant linearlayout horizontal and use android:layout_weight to make the percentageCheck https://github.com/mmin18/FlexLayout which you can use percent or java expression directly in layout xml.
