Should I use <img>, <object>, or <embed> for loading SVG files into a page in a way similar to loading a jpg, gif or png?What is the code for each to ensure it works as well as possible? (I\'m seeing references to including the mimetype or pointing to fallback SVG renderers in my research and not seeing a good state of the art reference).Assume I am checking for SVG support with Modernizr and falling back (probably doing a replacement with a plain <img> tag)for non SVG-capable browsers.I can recommend the SVG Primer (published by the W3C), which covers this topic: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/IG/resources/svgprimer.html#SVG_in_HTMLIf you use <object> then you get raster fallback for free*:*) Well, not quite for free, because some browsers download both resources, see Larry\'s suggestion below for how to get around that.2014 update:If you want a non-interactive svg, use <img> with script fallbacks\nto png version (for older IE and android < 3). One clean and simple\nway to do that:<img src="your.svg" onerror="this.src=\'your.png\'">. This will behave much like a GIF image, and if your browser supports declarative animations (SMIL) then those will play.If you want an interactive svg, use either <iframe> or <object>. If you need to provide older browsers the ability to use an svg plugin, then use <embed>.For svg in css background-image and similar properties, modernizr is one choice for switching to fallback images, another is depending on multiple backgrounds to do it automatically:Note: the multiple backgrounds strategy doesn\'t work on Android 2.3  because it supports multiple backgrounds but not svg.An additional good read is this blogpost on svg fallbacks.<object> and <embed> have an interesting property: they make it possible to obtain a reference to SVG document from outer document (taking same-origin policy into account). The reference can then be used to animate the SVG, change its stylesheets, etc.GivenYou can then do things likeFrom IE9 and above you can use SVG in a ordinary IMG tag..http://caniuse.com/svg-imgThe best option is to use SVG Images on different devices :)If you use <img> tags, then webkit based browsers won\'t display embedded bitmapped images.If you use inline SVG\'s, then Explorer won\'t resize the SVG according to your CSS.\nExplorer will resize the SVG correctly, but you must specify both the height and width.I have found that the <object> tag is the only one that works across all browsers. I had to change the width and height (inside the SVG) to 100% in order to get it to resize correctly.You can add onclick, onmouseover, etc. inside the svg, to any shape in the SVG: onmouseover="top.myfunction(evt);"You can also use web fonts in the SVG by including them in your regular style sheet.Note: if you are exporting SVG\'s from Illustrator, the web font names will be wrong. You can correct this in your CSS and avoid messing around in the SVG. For example, Illustrator gives the wrong name to Arial, and you can fix it like this:All this works on any browser released in the last two years.Results at ozake.com (in French). The whole site is made of SVG\'s except for the contact form.Warning: Web fonts are not precisely resized, and if you have lots of transitions from plain text to bold or italic, there may be a small amount of extra or missing space at the transition points. See my answer at this question for more information.Most current browsers today support the srcset attribute, which allows specifying different images to different users. For example, you can use it for 1x and 2x pixel density, and the browser will select the correct file.In this case, if you specify an SVG in the srcset and the browser doesn\'t support it, it\'ll fallback on the src.This method has several benefits over other solutions:Found one solution with pure CSS and without double image downloading. It is not beautiful as I want, but it works.The idea is to insert special SVG with fallback style.More details and testing process you can find in my blog.This jQuery function captures all errors in svg images and replaces the file extension with an alternate extensionPlease open the console to see the error loading image svgRE Inline Block\nSVG implementation is borked across browsers if you use inline-block. \nUse display:table and display:table-cell and with the svg as an img for the most reliable views.\nObjects and background images display unpredictably. Also be aware of Adobe Illustrator export options and the \'responsive\' tick box which may or may not help. 2016 and they still haven\'t sorted out SVG?
