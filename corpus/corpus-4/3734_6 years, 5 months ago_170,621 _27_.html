Apart from being non persistent and scoped only to the current window, are there any benefits (performance, data access, etc) to Session Storage over Local Storage?localStorage and sessionStorage both extend Storage. There is no difference between them except for the intended "non-persistence" of sessionStorage.That is, the data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.For sessionStorage, changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is deleted.The only difference is that localStorage has a different expiration time, sessionStorage will only be accessible while and by the window that created it is open. localStorage lasts until you delete it or the user deletes it.\nLets say that you wanted to save a login username and password you would want to use sessionStorageover localStorage for security reasons (ie. another person accessing their account at a later time). But if you wanted to save a user\'s settings on their machine you would  probably want localStorage. All in all:localStorage - use for long term use.\nsessionStorage - use when you need to store somthing that changes or somthing temporary Few other points which might be helpful to understand differences between local and session storageBoth local storage and session storage are scoped to document origin, sohttps://mydomain.com/ \nhttp://mydomain.com/ \nhttps://mydomain.com:8080/All of the above URL\'s will not share the same storage. (Notice path of the web page does not affect the web storage)Session storage is different even for the document with same origin policy open in different tabs, so same web page open in two different tabs cannot share the same session storage.Both local and session storage are also scoped by browser vendors. So storage data saved by IE cannot be read by Chrome or FF.Hope this helps.The main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is that sessionStorage is unique per tab. If you close the tab the sessionStorage gets deleted, localStorage does not. Also you cannot communicate between tabs :)Another subtle difference is that for example on Safari (8.0.3) localStorage has a limit of 2551 k characters but sessionStorage has unlimited storageOn Chrome (v43) both localStorage and sessionStorage are limited to 5101 k characters (no difference between normal / private mode)On Firefox both localStorage and sessionStorage are limited to 5120 k characters (no difference between normal / incognito mode)No difference in speed whatsoever :)There\'s also a problem with Mobile Safari and Mobile Chrome, Private Mode Safari & Chrome have a maximum space of 0KBsessionStorage is the same as localStorage, except that it stores the data for only one session, and it will be removed when the user closes the browser window that created itperformance wise, my (crude) measurements found no difference on 1000 writes and readssecurity wise, intuitively it would seem the localStore might be shut down before the sessionStore, but have no  concrete evidence - maybe someone else does?functional wise, concur with digitalFresh aboveLocal storage can store upto 10mb offline data, whereas session storage can store upto 5 mb data. But cookies can store only 4kb text data. Ya session storage and local storage are same in behaviour except one that is local storage will store the data until and unless the user delete the cache and cookies and session storage data will retain in the system until we close the session i,e until we close the session storage created window.There is no difference between them extend Storage, but the sessionStorage for the session (tab or for the window) and localStorage exists for the domain until it is explicitly deleted (calling clear method or clearing browser cash).The advantage of the session storage over local storage, in my opinion, is that it has unlimited capacity in Firefox, and won\'t persist longer than the session. (Of course it depends on what your goal is.)
