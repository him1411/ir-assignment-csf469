How can I sort this array of objects by one of its fields, like name or count ?Use usort, here\'s an example adapted from the manual:edits imported from comments:If you\'re sorting the array from inside the class and your sorting function cmp is also defined inside the class, then use this:Heres a nicer way using closuresPlease note this is not in PHP\'s documentation but if you using 5.3+ closures are supported where callable arguments can be provided.if you\'re using php oop you might need to change to:The same code will be with the count field.More details about usort: http://ru2.php.net/usortBtw, where did you get that array from? I hope that not from database?You can use this function (works in PHP Version >= 5.3):Example:If you need local based string comparison, you can use strcoll instead of strcmp.Remeber to first use setlocale with LC_COLLATE to set locale information if needed.If you are using this inside Codeigniter, you can use the methods:@rmooney thank you for the suggestion. It really helps me.Downside of all answers here is that they use static field names, so I wrote an adjusted version in OOP style. Assumed you are using getter methods you could directly use this Class and use the field name as parameter. Probably someone find it useful.You can use usort, like this:If you need to sort by only one field, then usort is a good choice. However, the solution quickly becomes messy if you need to sort by multiple fields. In this case, YaLinqo library* can be used, which implements SQL-like query syntax for arrays and objects. It has a pretty syntax for all cases:Here, \'$v->count\' is a shorthand for function ($v) { return $v->count; } (either can be used). These method chains return iterators, but you can get arrays by adding ->toArray() in the end if you need it.* developed by meYou can use sorted function from Nspl:Thanks for the inspirations, I also had to add an external $translator parameterIf you want to sort integer values:
