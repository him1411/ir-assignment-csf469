Here is Bar#do_things:And here is Foo#some_method: I thought about using raise, but I am trying to make it generic, so I don\'t want to put anything any specific in Foo.Use the keyword  next. If you do not want to continue to the next item, use break.When next is used within a block, it causes the block to exit immediately, returning control to the iterator method, which may then begin a new iteration by invoking the block again:When used in a block, break transfers control out of the block, out of the iterator that invoked the block, and to the first expression following the invocation of the iterator:And finally, the usage of return in a block:return always causes the enclosing method to return, regardless of how deeply nested within blocks it is (except in the case of lambdas):I wanted to just be able to break out of a block - sort of like a forward goto, not really related to a loop.  In fact, I want to break of of a block that is in a loop without terminating the loop.  To do that, I made the block a one-iteration loop:Hope this helps the next googler that lands here based on the subject line.If you want your block to return a useful value (e.g. when using #map, #inject, etc.), next and break also accept an argument.Consider the following:The equivalent using next:Of course, you could always extract the logic needed into a method and call that from inside your block:use the keyword break instead of returnPerhaps you can use the built-in methods for finding particular items in an Array, instead of each-ing targets and doing everything by hand. A few examples:One example would be doing something like this:next and break seem to do the correct thing in this simplified example!output: 1 3 4 5 6 7 8To break the loop or exit of the loop just simply use return keyword \nreturn if element.nil?
