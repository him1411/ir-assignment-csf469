I am trying to write a message to the output window for debugging purposes. I searched for a function like Java\'s system.out.println(""). I tried Debug.Write, Console.Write, and Trace.Write. It does not give an error, but it does not print anything either."Define DEBUG constant" and "Define TRACE constant" options are checked.Menu Tools \xe2\x86\x92 Options \xe2\x86\x92 Debugging \xe2\x86\x92 "Redirect all Output Window text to the Immediate Window" option is not checked.Configuration: Active (Debug)Note: I created a project with the wizard as "Windows Forms Application" if relevant. I have no idea where to look.Add the System.Diagnostics namespace, and then you can use Debug.WriteLine() to quickly print a message to the output window of the IDE. For more details, please refer to these:This will write to the debug output window:Use:is what you\'re looking for.If not, try doing this: Menu Tools \xe2\x86\x92 Options \xe2\x86\x92 Debugging \xe2\x86\x92 uncheck Send Output to Immediate.For me, only the Trace namespace and not the Debug one worked: I\'m working in a C# project under Visual Studio 2010.You may be looking fororThe callfails when working with .NET Core (V 1.0 or 1.1).We are supposed to create and use a logger from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, but that log only appears in the dotnet.exe popup console window, not in Visual Studio\'s Output window.Print to the output window of the Visual Studio:The following worked for me in Visual Studio 2015:Read the documentation for OutputDebugStringW here.\nNote that this method only works if you are debugging your code (debug mode)This is not an answer to the original Q. But since I found this Q when searching for a means of interactively dumping object data, I figured others may benefit from mentioning this very useful alternative. I ultimately used the Command Window and entered the Debug.Print command, as shown below. This printed a memory object in a format that can be copied as text, which is all I really needed.Hope this helps someone..
