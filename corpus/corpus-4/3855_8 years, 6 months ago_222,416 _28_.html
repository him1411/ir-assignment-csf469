I have an annoying bug in on a webpage: "date.GetMonth() is not a function". So I suppose that I am doing something wrong since somewhere and the object date is not an object of type Date. How can I check for a datatype in Javascript? I tried to add a if(date) but it doesn\'t work.So if I want to write defensive code and prevent the date (which is not one) to be formatted, how do I do that?Thanks!UPDATE: I don\'t want to check the format of the date, but I want to be sure that the parameter passed to the method getFormatedDate is of type Date.As an alternative to duck typing viayou can use the instanceof operator, i.e. But it will return true for invalid dates too, e.g. new Date(\'random_string\') is also instance of DateThis will fail if objects are passed across frame boundaries.A work-around for this is to check the object\'s class viaYou can use the following code:The function is getMonth(), not GetMonth().Anyway, you can check if the object has a getMonth property by doing this. It doesn\'t necessarily mean the object is a Date, just any object which has a getMonth property.As indicated above, it\'s probably easiest to just check if the function exists before using it.  If you really care that it\'s a Date, and not just an object with a getMonth() function, try this:This will create either a clone of the value if it\'s a Date, or create an invalid date.  You can then check if the new date\'s value is invalid or not.For all types I cooked up an Object prototype function. It may be of use to youNow you can check any type like this:[Edit march 2013] based on progressing insight this is a better method:You could check if a function specific to the Date object exists:Underscore, Lodash and similar libs have .isDate() helpers. Very useful.In order to check if the value is a valid type of the standard JS-Date object, you can make use of this predicate:When using jQuery, Object.prototype.toString.call(date) === "[object Date]" can be replaced with jQuery.type(date)=== "date".This function will return true if it\'s Date or false otherwise:Actually date will be of type Object. But you can check if the object has getMonth method and if it is callable.The best way I found is:Also you can use short formor something like this:Couldn\'t you just use I have been using a much simpler way but am not sure if this is only available in ES6 or not. However, this will not work on null or undefined since they have no constructor.
