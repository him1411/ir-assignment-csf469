I am currently using NodeJS v0.6.16 on mac os x 10.7.4. Now I want to upgrade it to the latest NodeJS v0.8.1. But after downloading and installing the latest pkg file from nodejs.org, I find the system is still using v0.6.16 instead of v0.8.1 when I typed "node -v" in a terminal. Is there any step that I have missed? Or should I thoroughly uninstall the old version before installing the latest one?BTW, I know that nvm can help to manage the nodejs packagehttps://github.com/creationix/nvm/Is there any means to upgrade the nodejs without using it?I have googled this problem, but it seems to me that there is no very clear answer to this question for the latest NodeJS. Many thanks. If you initially installed Node.js with Homebrew, run:Or as a one-liner:If you installed via a package, then download the latest version from nodejs.org. This is now the recommended way to install node (>4.0)See Installing Node.js and updating npm.Note: If you have npm --version >= 2.7.1, you can replace install (above) with update.Here\'s how I successfully upgraded from v0.8.18 to v0.10.20 without any other requirements like brew etc, (type these commands in terminal):Note that sudo might prompt your password.If the version number doesn\'t show up when typing node -v, you might have to reboot.these instructions are found here as well: davidwalsh.name/upgrade-nodejsBecause this seems to be at the top of Google when searching for how to upgrade nodejs on mac I will offer my tip for anyone coming along in the future despite its age. Upgrading via NPM\nYou can use the method described by @Mathias above or choose the following simpler method via the terminal. After which you may opt to confirm the upgradeYour nodejs should have upgraded to the latest version. If you wish to upgrade to a specific one say v0.8.19 then instead of useEDIT\nAvoid using sudo unless you need to. Refer to comment by Steve in the commentsGo to http://nodejs.org and download and run the installer.\nIt works now - for me at least. You could install nvm and have multiple versions of Node.js installed.and then run:you can see what versions you have installed with :and you can change between versions with:The great thing about using NVM is that you can test different versions alongside one another.  If different apps require different versions of Node.js, you can run them both.I use Node version manager (called n) for it.thenOROn macOS the homebrew recommended way is to runand also to be able to use ES6 Features. Do install latest version instead of the recommended stable version. Can be Found here Node JS.All your projects will work fine.you can also, as suggested by some other users. do a command line update. for that on your terminal just hit this command.npm i -g n && n latest\n the above command will install n package from node package manager and install the latest version of the node in the system. this will now allow you to run latest es6 features on your node prompt or projects by default.Go to the website nodejs.org and download the latest pkg then install.\nit works for meI used brew to upgrade my node. It has installed but it located in /usr/local/Cellar/node/5.5.0 and there is a default node in /usr/local/bin/node which bothers me. I don\'t want to make soft link because I don\'t really know how brew is organized. \nSo I download the pkg file, installed and I got this info:Node.js was installed atnpm was installed atMake sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH.Now the upgrade is completedYou can just go to nodejs.org and download the newest package. It will update appropriately for you. NPM will be updated as well.You can run but you can\'t hide... At the end you will be using NVM anyways.I am able to upgrade the node using following commandI think the simplest way to use the newest version of Node.js is to get the newest Node.js pkg file in the website https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/\nif you want to use different version of Node.js you can use nvm or n to manage it.
