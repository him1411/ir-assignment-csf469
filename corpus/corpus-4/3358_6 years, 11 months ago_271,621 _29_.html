How to get the last character of the string:The last character of this string is "."How can I find this?An elegant and short alternative, is the String.prototype.slice method.Just by:A negative start index slices the string from length+index, to length, being index -1, the last character is extracted:Use charAt:The charAt() method returns the character at the specified index in a string.You can use this method in conjunction with the length property of a string to get the last character in that string.\nFor example:Some browsers allow (as a non-standard extension) you to shorten this to:Use substr with parameter -1:"linto.yahoo.com.".substr(-1);equals "."Note: To extract characters from the end of the string, use a negative start number (This does not work in IE 8 and earlier).You can achieve this using different ways but with different performance,1. Using bracket notation:var str = "Test";\n  var lastLetter = str[str.length - 1];But it is recommended not to use brackets. Check the reasons Here2. charAt[index]:var lastLetter = str.charAt(str.length - 1)This is readable and fastest among others. It is most recommended way.3. substring:4. slice:str.slice(-1);Its slightly faster than substring.You can check the performance HereYou can get the last char like this :Use the JavaScript charAt function to get a character at a given 0-indexed position. Use length to find out how long the String is. You want the last character so that\'s length - 1. \nExample:
