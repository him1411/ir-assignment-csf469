In Perl (and other languages) a conditional ternary operator can be expressed like this:Is there a similar operator in VB.NET?Depends.  The If operator in VB.NET 2008 acts as a ternary operator.  This was just introduced, prior to 2008 this was not available.  Here\'s some more info:  Visual Basic If announcementExample:iif has always been available in VB, even in VB6.It is not a true operator, as such, but a function in the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace.If() is the closest equivalent but beware of implicit conversions going on if you have set "Option Strict off"For example, if your not careful you may be tempted to try something like:Will give "foo" a value of 0! I think the \'?\' operator equivalent in C# would instead fail compilationIf( [argument1,] argument2, argument3 )\nWhen If is called by using three arguments, the first argument must evaluate to a value that can be cast as a Boolean. That Boolean value will determine which of the other two arguments is evaluated and returned. The following list applies only when the If operator is called by using three arguments.You can use this example :Dim MyResult As String = If(MyString = MyCondition, "trueValue", "falseValue")I don\'t think this answers the original question, but it\'s certainly what I was looking for when I found this page!https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z2wkh0tk(v=vs.90).aspx#Anchor_1VB 2010 and up also support this expression:test ? expression1 : expression2example:var now = new Date(); var greeting = "Good" + ((now.getHours() > 17) ?\n  " evening." : " day.");check msdn documentation here:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zakwfxx4(v=vs.100).aspxUse this line,
