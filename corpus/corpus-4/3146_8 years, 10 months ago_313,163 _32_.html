It seems like there should be a simpler way than:Is there?From an efficiency perspective, you\'re not going to beat It\'s performing raw string operations in C with a lookup table - there\'s not much that will beat that but writing your own C code.If speed isn\'t a worry, another option though is:This is faster than s.replace with each char, but won\'t perform as well as non-pure python approaches such as regexes or string.translate, as you can see from the below timings.  For this type of problem, doing it at as low a level as possible pays off.Timing code:This gives the following results:Regular expressions are simple enough, if you know them. I usually use something like this:Not necessarily simpler, but a different way, if you are more familiar with the re family. string.punctuation is ascii ONLY! A more correct (but also much slower) way is to use the unicodedata module:For the convenience of usage, I sum up the note of striping punctuation from a string in both Python2 and Python3. Please refer to other answers for the detailed description.Python2Python3For Python 3 str or Python 2 unicode values, str.translate() only takes a dictionary; codepoints (integers) are looked up in that mapping and anything mapped to None is removed.To remove (some?) punctuation then, use:The dict.fromkeys() class method makes it trivial to create the mapping, setting all values to None based on the sequence of keys.To remove all punctuation, not just ASCII punctuation, your table needs to be a little bigger; see J.F. Sebastian\'s answer (Python 3 version):This might not be the best solution however this is how I did it.This question is over 6 years old, but I\'d figured I chime in with a function I wrote. It\'s not very efficient, but it is simple and you can add or remove any punctuation that you desire:Here\'s a one liner for python 3.5:string.punctuation misses loads of punctation marks that are commonly used in the real world. How about a solution that works for non-ascii punctuation\xef\xbc\x9fPersonally, I beleive this is the best way to remove punctuation from a string in python because:This uses unicode character properties, which you can read more about on wikipedia.Here\'s a solution without regex.Do search and replace using the regex functions, as seen here.. If you have to repeatedly perform the operation, you can keep a compiled copy of the regex pattern (your punctuation) around, which will speed things up a bit.One liner might be helpful in not very strict cases:This is how to change our documents to uppercase \nor lower case.I haven\'t seen this answer yet. Just use a regex removes all characters besides word characters (\\w) and number characters (\\d), followed by a whitespace character (\\s):Remove stop words from the text file using Python I like to use a function like this:
