What is the difference between require() and library()?There\'s not much of one in everyday work.However, according to the documentation for both functions (accessed by putting a ? before the function name and hitting enter), require is used inside functions, as it outputs a warning and continues if the package is not found, whereas library will throw an error.Another benefit of require() is that it returns a logical value by default. TRUE if the packages is loaded, FALSE if it isn\'t.So you can use require() in constructions like the one below. Which mainly handy if you want to distribute your code to our R installation were packages might not be installed.You can use require() if you want to install packages if and only if necessary, such as:For multiple packages you can usePro tips:When used inside the script, you can avoid a dialog screen by specifying the repos parameter of install.packages(), such asYou can wrap require() and library() in suppressPackageStartupMessages() to, well, suppress package startup messages, and also use the parameters require(..., quietly=T, warn.conflicts=F) if needed to keep the installs quiet.In addition to the good advice already given, I would add this:It is probably best to avoid using require() unless you actually will be using the value it returns e.g in some error checking loop such as given by thierry.In most other cases it is better to use library(), because this will give an error message at package loading time if the package is not available. require() will just fail without an error if the package is not there. This is the best time to find out if the package needs to be installed (or perhaps doesn\'t even exist because it it spelled wrong).  Getting error feedback early and at the relevant time will avoid possible headaches with tracking down why later code fails when it attempts to use library routinesand you will see:library(package) and require(package) both load the package with name\n  package and put it on the search list. require is designed for use\n  inside other functions; it returns FALSE and gives a warning (rather\n  than an error as library() does by default) if the package does not\n  exist. Both functions check and update the list of currently loaded\n  packages and do not reload a package which is already loaded. (If you\n  want to reload such a package, call detach(unload = TRUE) or\n  unloadNamespace first.) If you want to load a package without putting\n  it on the search list, use requireNamespace.My initial theory about the difference was that library loads the packages whether it is already loaded or not, i.e. it might reload an already loaded package, while require just checks that it is loaded, or loads it if it isn\'t (thus the use in functions that rely on a certain package). The documentation refutes this, however, and explicitly states that neither function will reload an already loaded package.Here seems to be the difference on an already loaded package.\nWhile it is true that both require and library do not load the package. Library does a lot of other things before it checks and exits.I would recommend removing "require" from the beginning of a function running 2mil times anyway, but if, for some reason I needed to keep it. require is technically a faster check.require() loads all additional packages
