I have the following CSS and HTML snippet being rendered.Is the problem is that the text area ends up being 8px wider (2px for border + 6px for padding) than the parent.  Is there a way to continue to use border and padding but constrain the total size of the textarea to the width of the parent?Why not? Forget the hacks and just do it with CSS?One I use frequently:See browser support here.The answer to many CSS formatting problems seems to be "add another <div>!"So, in that spirit, have you tried adding a wrapper div to which the border/padding are applied and then putting the 100% width textarea inside of that?  Something like (untested):let\'s consider the final output rendered to the user of what we want to achieve: a padded textarea with both a border and a padding, which characteristics are that being clicked they pass the focus to our textarea, and the advantage of an automatic 100% width typical of block elements.The best approach in my opinion is to use low level solutions as far as possible, to reach the maximum browsers support.\nIn this case the only HTML could work fine, avoiding the use of Javascript (which anyhow we all love).The LABEL tag comes in our help because has such behaviour and is allowed to contain the input elements it must address to.\nIts default style is the one of inline elements, so, giving to the label a block display style we can avail ourselves of the automatic 100% width including padding and borders, while the inner textarea has no border, no padding and a 100% width.Taking a look at the W3C specifics other advantages we may notice are:See W3C specifics for more detailed information.Simple example:<body>\n<div class="container">\n    I am the container\n    <label class="textareaContainer">\n        <textarea name="text">I am the padded textarea with a styled border...</textarea>\n    </label>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\nThe padding and border of the .textareaContainer elements are the ones we want to give to the textarea. Try editing them to style it as you want.\nI gave large and visible padding and borders to the .textareaContainer element to let you see their behaviour when clicked.If you\'re not too bothered about the width of the padding, this solution will actually keep the padding in percentages too..Not perfect, but you\'ll get some padding and the width adds up to 100% so its all goodI came across another solution here that is so simple: add padding-right to the textarea\'s container. This keeps the margin, border, and padding on the textarea, which avoids the problem that Beck pointed out about the focus highlight that chrome and safari put around the textarea.The container\'s padding-right should be the sum of the effective margin, border, and padding on both sides of the textarea, plus any padding you may otherwise want for the container. So, for the case in the original question:\n\nThis code works for me with IE8 and FirefoxYou can make use of the box-sizing property, it\'s supported by all the main standard-compliant browsers and IE8+. You still will need a workaround for IE7 though. Read more here.No, you cannot do that with CSS. That is the reason Microsoft initially introduced another, and maybe more practical box model. The box  model that eventually won, makes it inpractical to mix percentages and units. I don\'t think it is OK with you to express padding and border widths in percentage of the parent too.Use box sizing property:That will help I often fix that problem with calc(). You just give the textarea a width of 100% and a certain amount of padding, but you have to subtract the total left and right padding of the 100% width you have given to the textarea:Or if you want to give the textarea a border:How about negative margins?If you pad and offset it like this:the right side of the textarea perfectly aligns with the right side of the container, and the text inside the textarea aligns perfectly with the body text in the container... and the left side of the textarea \'sticks out\' a bit. it\'s sometimes prettier.For people who use Bootstrap, textarea.form-control can lead to textarea sizing issues as well. Chrome and Firefox appear to use different heights with the following Bootstrap CSS:
