I\'ve installed devise on my app and applied the following in my application.html.erb file:I ran rake routes and confirmed that all the routes are valid.Also, in my routes.rb file I have devise_for :users and root :to => "home#index". I get the following routing error when clicking the "Sign out" link:Any ideas what\'s causing the error?I think the route for signing out is a DELETE method.  This means that your sign out link needs to look like this:Yours doesn\'t include the :method => :delete part.  Also, please note that for this to work you must also include <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %> in your layout file (application.html.erb).I changed this line in devise.rb:toand it started working for me. You probably didn\'t include jquery_ujs javascript file. Make sure you are using the latest version of jquery-ujs : https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs and the last files available :You should not have any more rails.js file. If you do, you\'re probably out-of-date.\nMake sure also this file is loaded with defaults, in config/application.rb(Again, you should not have rails.js file here).\nFinally, add the link as documented on Devise wiki (haml-style):And everything will be fine. The ability to make the Logout link a DELETE RESTful call requires an html attribute data-method = "delete" by using the rails code = link_to(\'Logout\', destroy_user_session_path, :method => :delete). However, if you do not have the gem jquery-ujs installed or are not calling the resulting javascript in your application.html via = javascript_include_tag "application", the response will be sent as a GET request, and the route will fail.You have a few options if you do not want to use jquery-ujs or cannot find a way to make it work:Try adding a new route to devise/sessions#destroy and linking to that.  Eg:view:Use it in your routes.rb file:I had the same problem with rails 3.1.0, and I solved adding in file the followings lines:With one exception, Jessie\'s answer worked for me: change:... to:So the code that worked for me is:Many answers to the question already. For me the problem was two fold: when I expand my routes: I was getting warning that this is depreciated so I have replaced it with: I thought I will remove my jQuery. Bad choice. Devise is using jQuery to "fake" DELETE request and send it as GET. Therefore you need to: and of course same link as many mentioned before: Add:Use these link_to tagsIn routes add:Other option is to configure the logout to be a GET instead a DELETE, you can do that adding the following line on /config/initializers/devise.rbBut as Steve Klabnik wrote on his blog (http://blog.steveklabnik.com/2011/12/11/devise-actioncontroller-routingerror-no-route-matches-get-slash-users-slash-sign-out.html) try to use   DELETE because of the semantic of this method. If you are using Rails 3.1 make sure your application.html.erb sign out looks like:<%= link_to "Sign out", destroy_user_session_path, :method => :delete %>And that your javascript include line looks like the following<%= javascript_include_tag \'application\' %> My guess is that some gems overwrite the new structure of the default.js location.Check it out with source code in github:https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/commit/adb127bb3e3b334cba903db2c21710e8c41c2b40#lib/generators/templates/devise.rb   (date : June 27, 2011 )Well, guys for me it was only remove the :method => :deleteThis means you haven\'t generated the jquery files after you have installed the jquery-rails gem. So first you need to generate it.rails generate devise:install First Option:This means either you have to change the following line on /config/initializers/devise.rbconfig.sign_out_via = :delete to config.sign_out_via = :getSecond Option:You only change this line <%= link_to "Sign out", destroy_user_session_path %> to <%= link_to "Sign out", destroy_user_session_path, :method => :delete %> on the view file. Usually :method => :delete is not written by default.I want to add to this even though it\'s a bit old.  the "sign_out" link didn\'t work, despite having :method => :delete.The comment indicating that <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %> must be included reminded me I had recently added JQuery java script and used simple <script src=""/> tags to include them.When I moved them from after the :defaults to before, the sign_out started working again.Hopefully this helps someone.Don\'t forget to include the following line in your application.js (Rails 3)Include jquery_ujs into my rails application and it works now.Most answers are partial.  I have hit this issue many times.  Two things need to be addressed:the delete method needs to be specifiedThen devise uses jquery, so you need to load thoseand ensure that BOTH jquery and jquery-ujs are specified in your myDirectiveJSfile.jsIf you\'re using HTTPS with devise, it\'ll break if your sign-out link is to the non-secure version. On the back end, it redirects to the secure version. That redirect is a GET, which causes the issue.Make sure your link uses HTTPS. You can force it with protocol: "https" in your url helper (make sure you use the url helper and not the path helper).In your routes.rb :and in your application.html.erb:This is what I did (with Rails 3.0 and Devise 1.4.2):the \':method => :delete\' in page is \'data-method="delete"\'\nso your page must have jquery_ujs.js, it will submit link with method delete not method get The problem begin with rails 3.1... in /app/assets/javascript/ just look for application.js.If the file doesn\'t exist create a file with that name I don\'t know why my file disappear or never was created on "rails new app"....That file is the instance for jquery....Lots of solutions are there. but mostly use this,or config devise.rb with proper sign_out methodIn devise.rbuse :get and :delete method for your path:See if your routes.rb has a "resource :users" before a "devise_for :users" then try swapping them:WorksFailsIn general when you get "No route matches"  but you think you have that route defined then double check the http verb / request method (whether its get, put, post, delete etc.) for that route. If you run rake routes then you will see the expected method and you can compare this with the request log. I know this is an old question based on Rails 3 but I just ran into and solved it on Rails 4.0.4. So thought I\'d pitch in how I fixed it for anyone encountering this problem with this version. Your mileage may vary but here\'s what worked for me.First make sure you have the gems installed and run bundle install.In application.js check that everything is required like below. Beware if this gotcha: it\'s //= require jquery.turbolinks and not //= require jquery-turbolinksNext, add the appropriate links in the header of application.html.erb. There seems to be many variations on how to implement the delete method which I assume depends on the version of Rails you are using.\nThis is the delete syntax I used. Hope that helps dig someone out of this very frustrating hole!
