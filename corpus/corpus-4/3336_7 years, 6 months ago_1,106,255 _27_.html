This question already has an answer here:I am trying to convert a date from yyyy-mm-dd to dd-mm-yyyy (but not in SQL); however I don\'t know how the date function requires a timestamp, and I can\'t get a timestamp from this string.How is this possible?Use strtotime() and date():(see strtotime and date docs on the PHP site).Edit: Note that this was a quick solution to the original question. For more extensive conversions, you should really be using the DateTime class to parse & format :-)If you\'d like to avoid strtotime conversion(for example strtotime is not being able to parse your input) you can use,or, equivalently:You are first giving it the format $dateString is in. Then you are telling it the format you want $newDateString to be in.Or if the source-format always is "Y-m-d" (yyyy-mm-dd), then just use DateTime:Without date conversion overhead, not sure it\'ll matter much.This code works for every date format. You can change the order of replacement variables such $3-$1-$2 due to your old date format.For more:click hereOr even shorter:Also another obscure possibility:I don\'t know if I would use it but still :)two ways to implement this 2) The most voted answer is actually incorrect!PHP strtotime Manual here states that "The function expects to be given a string containing an English date format". What it actually means is that it expects an American US date format, such as "m-d-Y" or "m/d/Y". That means that a date provided as "Y-m-d" may get misinterpreted by strtotime. You should provide the date in the expected format.I wrote a little function to return dates in several formats. Use and modify as will. If anyone does turn that into a Class, I\'d be glad if that would be shared.You can try strftime function. Something like strftime($time, \'%d %m %Y\'); Given below is PHP code to generate tomorrow\'s date using mktime() and change its format to dd/mm/yyyy format and then print it using echo.Use this function to convert from any format to any format
