When comparing two strings in c# for equality, what is the difference between InvariantCulture and Ordinal comparison?Uses a "standard" set of character orderings (a,b,c, ... etc.).  This is in contrast to some specific locales, which may sort characters in different orders (\'a-with-acute\' may be before or after \'a\', depending on the locale, and so on).On the other hand, looks purely at the values of the raw byte(s) that represent the character.  There\'s a great sample at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e6883c06.aspx that shows the results of the various StringComparison values.  All the way at the end, it shows (excerpted):You can see that where InvariantCulture yields (U+0069, U+0049, U+00131), Ordinal yields (U+0049, U+0069, U+00131).It does matter, for example - there is a thing called character expansionWith InvariantCulture the \xc3\x9f character gets expanded to ss.Another handy difference (in English where accents are uncommon) is that an InvariantCulture comparison compares the entire strings by case-insensitive first, and then if necessary (and requested) distinguishes by case after first comparing only on the distinct letters.  (You can also do a case-insensitive comparison, of course, which won\'t distinguish by case.)  Corrected: Accented letters are considered to be another flavor of the same letters and the string is compared first ignoring accents and then accounting for them if the general letters all match (much as with differing case except not ultimately ignored in a case-insensitive compare).  This groups accented versions of the otherwise same word near each other instead of completely separate at the first accent difference.  This is the sort order you would typically find in a dictionary, with capitalized words appearing right next to their lowercase equivalents, and accented letters being near the corresponding unaccented letter.An ordinal comparison compares strictly on the numeric character values, stopping at the first difference.  This sorts capitalized letters completely separate from the lowercase letters (and accented letters presumably separate from those), so capitalized words would sort nowhere near their lowercase equivalents.InvariantCulture also considers capitals to be greater than lower case, whereas Ordinal considers capitals to be less than lowercase (a holdover of ASCII from the old days before computers had lowercase letters, the uppercase letters were allocated first and thus had lower values than the lowercase letters added later).For example, by Ordinal: "0" < "9" < "A" < "Ab" < "Z" < "a" < "aB" < "ab" < "z" < "Á" < "Áb" < "á" < "áb"And by InvariantCulture: "0" < "9" < "a" < "A" < "á" < "Á" < "ab" < "aB" < "Ab" < "áb" < "Áb" < "z" < "Z"Pointing to Best Practices for Using Strings in the .NET Framework:And finally:Invariant is a linguistically appropriate type of comparison.\nOrdinal is a binary type of comparison.

(googled)Here is an example where string equality comparison using InvariantCultureIgnoreCase and OrdinalIgnoreCase will not give the same results:If you run this, equals1 will be false, and equals2 will be true.Always try to use InvariantCulture in those string methods that accept it as overload. By using  InvariantCulture you are on a safe side. Many .NET programmers may not use this functionality but if your software will be used by different cultures, InvariantCulture is an extremely handy feature.
