I\'m building a PHP script that feeds JSON data to another script. My script builds data into a large associative array, and then outputs the data using json_encode. Here is an example script:The above code yields the following output:This is great if you have a small amount of data, but I\'d prefer something along these lines: Is there a way to do this in PHP without an ugly hack? It seems like someone at Facebook figured it out.PHP 5.4 offers the JSON_PRETTY_PRINT option for use with the json_encode() call.http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.phpThis function will take JSON string and indent it very readable. It also should be convergent, InputOutputCodeI had the same issue.Anyway I just used the json formatting code here:http://recursive-design.com/blog/2008/03/11/format-json-with-php/Works well for what I needed it for. And a more maintained version: https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nicejson-phpMany users suggested that you useWhich is absolutely right. But it\'s not enough, the browser needs to understand the type of data, you can specify the header just before echo-ing the data back to the user.This will result in a well formatted output.Or, if you like extensions you can use JSONView for Chrome.If you are on firefox install JSONovich. Not really a PHP solution I know, but it does the trick for development purposes/debugging.I realize this question is asking about how to encode an associative array to a pretty-formatted JSON string, so this doesn\'t directly answer the question, but if you have a string that is already in JSON format, you can make it pretty simply by decoding and re-encoding it (requires PHP >= 5.4):This outputs:I took the code from Composer : https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/Json/JsonFile.php and nicejson : https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nicejson-php/blob/master/nicejson.php\nComposer code is good because it updates fluently from 5.3 to 5.4 but it only encodes object whereas nicejson takes json strings, so i merged them. The code can be used to format json string and/or encode objects, i\'m currently using it in a Drupal module.Use <pre> in combination with json_encode() and the JSON_PRETTY_PRINT option:You can modify Kendall Hopkins\' answer a little in the switch statement to get a pretty clean looking and nicely indented printout by passing a json string into the following:}Now just run the function prettyPrint( $your_json_string ); inline in your php and enjoy the printout. If you\'re a minimalist and don\'t like brackets for some reason, you can get rid of those easily by replacing the $char.="<br>"; with $char="<br>"; in the top three switch cases on $char. Here\'s what you get for a google maps API call for the city of CalgaryHave color full output: Tiny SolutionCode:If you used only $json_string = json_encode($data, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);, you will get in the browser something like this (using the Facebook link from the question :) ):\nbut if you used a chrome Extension like JSONView (even without the PHP option above), then you get a more pretty readable debuggable solution where you can even Fold/Collapse each single JSON object easily like this:\nYou could do it like below.Above would output kind of like Facebook.Simple way for php>5.4: like in Facebook graphResult in browser\nClassic case for a recursive solution.  Here\'s mine:Usage:Cheersprint_r pretty print for PHPExample PHP1 - json_encode($rows,JSON_PRETTY_PRINT); returns prettified data with newline characters. This is helpful for command line input, but as you\'ve discovered doesn\'t look as pretty within the browser. The browser will accept the newlines as the source (and thus, viewing the page source will indeed show the pretty JSON), but they aren\'t used to format the output in browsers. Browsers require HTML.2 - use this fuction githubIf you have existing JSON $ugly_json:The following is what worked for me:Contents of test.php:output:Also note the use of "pre" tag in html.Hope that helps someoneIf you are working with MVCtry doing this in your controllerthen if you call /getLatestUsers you will get a pretty JSON output ;)I don\'t have sufficient reputation to reply to Kendall Hopkins, but I found a bug in his prettifier (it came up awkwardly as well)This line should be modified: toThe prettifier breaks and produces invalid json when a string ends with a backslash like so:
