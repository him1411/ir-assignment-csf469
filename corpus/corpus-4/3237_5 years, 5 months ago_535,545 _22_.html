I know how to provide a username and password to an https request like this:But I\'d like to know how to provide a username and password to the remote like this:I\'ve tried like this:But they haven\'t worked.This way worked for me from a github repositoryEdit based on Michael_Scharf\'s comment:You can leave out the password so that it won\'t be logged your bash history file:It will prompt you for your passwordThe user@host:path/to/repo format tells Git to use ssh to log in to host with username user.  From git help clone:An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:[user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/The part before the @ is the username, and the authentication method (password, public key, etc.) is determined by ssh, not Git.  Git has no way to pass a password to ssh, because ssh might not even use a password depending on the configuration of the remote server.If you don\'t want to type your ssh password all the time, the typical solution is to generate a public/private key pair, put the public key in your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server, and load your private key into ssh-agent.  Also see Configuring Git over SSH to login once, GitHub\'s help page on ssh key passphrases, gitolite\'s ssh documentation, and Heroku\'s ssh keys documentation.If you have multiple accounts at a place like GitHub or Heroku, you\'ll have multiple ssh keys (at least one per account).  To pick which account you want to log in as, you have to tell ssh which private key to use.For example, suppose you had two GitHub accounts:  foo and bar.  Your ssh key for foo is ~/.ssh/foo_github_id and your ssh key for bar is ~/.ssh/bar_github_id.  You want to access git@github.com:foo/foo.git with your foo account and git@github.com:bar/bar.git with your bar account.  You would add the following to your ~/.ssh/config:You would then clone the two repositories as follows:Some services provide HTTP access as an alternative to ssh:GitHub:Gitorious:Heroku:  See this support article.WARNING:  Adding your password to the clone URL will cause Git to store your plaintext password in .git/config.  To securely store your password when using HTTP, use a credential helper.  For example:The above will cause Git to ask for your password once every 15 minutes (by default).  See git help credentials for details.
