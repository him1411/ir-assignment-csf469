Is it possible to nest html forms like thisso that both forms work? My friend is having problems with this, a part of the subForm works, while another part of it does not.In a word, no. You can have several forms in a page but they should not be nested.From the html5 working draft:4.10.3 The form elementContent model:Flow content, but with no form element descendants.The second form will be ignored, see the snippet from WebKit for example:Plain html cannot allow you to do this. But with javascript you can be able to do that.\nIf you are using javascript/jquery you could classify your form elements with a class and then use serialize() to serialize only those form elements for the subset of the items you want to submit.Then in your javascript you could do this to serialize class1 elementsFor class2 you could doFor the whole formor simplyIf you\'re using AngularJS, any <form> tags inside your ng-app are replaced at runtime with ngForm directives that are designed to be nested.In Angular forms can be nested. This means that the outer form is valid when all of the child forms are valid as well. However, browsers do not allow nesting of <form> elements, so Angular provides the ngForm directive which behaves identically to <form> but can be nested. This allows you to have nested forms, which is very useful when using Angular validation directives in forms that are dynamically generated using the ngRepeat directive.  (source)I ran into a similar problem, and I know that is not an answer to the question, but it can be of help to someone with this kind of problem:\nif there is need to put the elements of two or more forms in a given sequence, the HTML5 <input> form attribute can be the solution.\nFrom http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_form.asp:Scenario:Implementation:Note: The form attribute does not work in any version of Internet Explorer and Edge.As Craig said, no.But, regarding your comment as to why:It might be easier to use 1 <form> with the inputs and the "Update" button, and use copy hidden inputs with the "Submit Order" button in a another <form>.Another way to get around this problem, if you are using some server side scripting language that allows you to manipulate the posted data, is to declare your html form like this :If you print the posted data (I will use PHP here), you will get an array like this :Then you can just do something like : Your $_POST now has only your "main form" data, and your subform data is stored in another variable you can manipulate at will.Hope this helps!Note you are not allowed to nest FORM elements!http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/forms.htmlhttps://www.w3.org/TR/html4/appendix/changes.html#h-A.3.9 (html4 specification notes no changes regarding nesting forms from 3.2 to 4)https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/appendix/changes.html#h-A.1.1.12 (html4 specification notes no changes regarding nesting forms from 4.0 to 4.1)https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/ (html5 specification notes no changes regarding nesting forms from 4 to 5)https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#association-of-controls-and-forms comments to "This feature allows authors to work around the lack of support for nested form elements.", but does not cite where this is specified, I think they are assuming that we should assume that it\'s specified in the html3 specification :)A simple workaround is to use a iframe to hold the "nested" form.\nVisually the form is nested but on the code side its in a separate html file altogether.Even if you could get it to work in one browser, there\'s no guarantee that it would work the same in all browsers. So while you might be able to get it to work some of the time, you certainly wouldn\'t be able to get it to work all of the time.You would even have problems making it work in different versions of the same browser. So  avoid using that.About nesting forms: I spent 10 years one afternoon trying to debug an ajax script.my previous answer/example didn\'t account for the html markup, sorry.form_2 constantly failed saying invalid form_2.When I moved the ajaxContainer that produced form_2 <i>outside</i> of form_1, I was back in business. It the answer the question as to why one might nest forms. I mean, really, what\'s the ID for if not to define which form is to be used? There must be a better, slicker work around. While I don\'t present a solution to nested forms (it doesn\'t work reliably), I do present a workaround that works for me:Usage scenario: A superform allowing to change N items at once. It has a "Submit All" button at the bottom. Each item wants to have its own nested form with a "Submit Item # N" button. But can\'t...In this case, one can actually use a single form, and then have the name of the buttons be submit_1..submit_N and submitAll and handle it servers-side, by only looking at params ending in _1 if the name of the button was submit_1.Ok, so not much of an invention, but it does the job.Use empty form tag before your nested formTested and Worked on Firefox, ChromeNot Tested on I.E.Although the question is pretty old and I agree with the @everyone that nesting of form is not allowed in HTML But this something all might want to see thiswhere you can hack(I\'m calling it a hack since I\'m sure this ain\'t legitimate) html to allow browser to have nested formJS FIDDLE LINK http://jsfiddle.net/nzkEw/10/Today, I also got stuck in same issue, and resolve the issue I have added a user control and\non this control I use this codeand on PreRenderComplete event of the page call this methodI believe this will help.
