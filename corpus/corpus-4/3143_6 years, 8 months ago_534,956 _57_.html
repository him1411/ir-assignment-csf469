This question already has an answer here:I have a C# solution with several projects in Visual Studio 2010.\nOne is a test project (I\'ll call it "PrjTest"), the other is a Windows Forms Application project (I\'ll call it "PrjForm").  There is also a third project referenced by PrjForm, which it is able to reference and use successfully.PrjForm references PrjTest, and PrjForm has a class with a using statement:The type or namespace name \'PrjTest\' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)I\'ve tried the following to resolve this:I have done my homework and spent far too long looking for an answer online, none of the solutions has helped yet.What else could I try?See this question.Turns out this was a client profiling issue.PrjForm was set to ".Net Framework 4 Client Profile"\nI changed it to ".Net Framework 4", and now I have a successful build.Thanks everyone! \nI guess it figures that after all that time spent searching online, I find the solution minutes after posting, I guess the trick is knowing the right question to ask..PrjForm was set to ".Net Framework 4 Client Profile" I changed it to ".Net Framework 4", and now I have a successful build.This worked for me too. Thanks a lot. I was trying an RDF example for dotNet where in I downloaded kit from dotnetrdf.NET4 Client Profile:\nAlways target NET4 Client Profile for all your client desktop applications (including Windows Forms and WPF apps).NET4 Full framework:\nTarget NET4 Full only if the features or assemblies that your app need are not included in the Client Profile. This includes:\nIf you are building Server apps, Such as:If you use legacy client scenarios, Such as:\no Use System.Data.OracleClient.dll which is deprecated in NET4 and not included in the Client Profile.If you targeting developer scenarios and need tool such as MSBuild or need access to design assemblies such as System.Design.dll In my case I had:Referenced DLL : .NET 4.5Project : .NET 4.0Because of the above mismatch, the 4.0 project couldn\'t see inside the namespace of the 4.5 .DLL. I recompiled the .DLL to target .NET 4.0 and I was fine.I solved mine because the other project was coded with .NET 4.5 and the other one was coded 4.0Another thing that can cause this error is having NuGet packages that have been built with a newer version of .NET.The original error:Further up in the log I found this:C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.Common.targets(1605,5): warning MSB3275: The primary reference "[redacted]\\DatabaseManager\\bin\\Release\\DatabaseManager.dll" could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the assembly "System.Data.SQLite, Version=1.0.94.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139" which was built against the ".NETFramework,Version=v4.5" framework. This is a higher version than the currently targeted framework ".NETFramework,Version=v4.0".The solution was to re-install the NuGet packages:http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/reinstalling-packagesIt is also possible, that the referenced projects targets .NET 4.0, while the Console App Project targets .NET 4.0 Client Library. While it might not have been related to this particular case, I think someone else can find this information useful.I encountered this issue it turned out to be.Project B references Project A.Project A compiled as A.dll (assembly name = A).Project B compiled as A.dll (assembly name A).Visual Studio 2010 wasn\'t catching this. Resharper was okay, but wouldn\'t compile. WinForms designer gave misleading error message saying likely resulting from incompatbile platform targets.The solution, after a painful day, was to make sure assemblies don\'t have same name.The using statement refers to a namespace, not a project.Make sure that you have the appropriately named namespace in your referenced project:Read more about namespaces on MSDN:I had the same issue. The target frameworks were fine for me. Still it was not working. \nI installed VS2010 sp1, and did a "Rebuild" on the PrjTest. Then it started working for me. Changing the framework to did the job for me.For COM/ActiveX references, VS 2012 will show this error right on using statement. Which is quite funny, since it\'s saying that may be you are missing a using statement. To solve this: register the actual COM/ActiveX dll even if it\'s in the neighbor project, and add a reference through COM channel, not project channel. It will add Interop.ProjectName instead of ProjectName as a reference and this solves this strange bug. The compiled dll should have public Class.If your project (PrjTest) does not expose any public types within the PrjTest namespace, it will cause that error.Does the project (PrjTest) include any classes or types in the "PrjTest" namespace which are public?just changed Application\'s target framework to ".Net Framework 4".And error got Disappeared.good luck;\n:DOther problem that might be causing such behavior are build configurations.I had two projects with configurations set to be built to specific folders.\nLike Debug and Any CPU and in second it was Debug and x86.What I did I went to Solution->Context menu->Properties->Configuration properties->Configuration and I set all my projects to use same configurations Debug and x86 and also checked Build tick mark.Then projects started to build correctly and were able to see namespaces.check your Project Properties, your Reference Paths should be empty like this:Regards
