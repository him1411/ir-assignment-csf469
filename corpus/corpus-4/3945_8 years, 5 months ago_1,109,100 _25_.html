I want my python function to split a sentence (input) and store each word in a list. The code that I\'ve written so far splits the sentence, but does not store the words as a list. How do I do that?This should be enough to store each word in a list.  words is already a list of the words from the sentence, so there is no need for the loop.Second, it might be a typo, but you have your loop a little messed up. If you really did want to use append, it would be:not Splits the string in text on any consecutive runs of whitespace.Split the string in text on delimiter: ",".The words variable will be a list and contain the words from text split on the delimiter.str.split()Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter \n  ... If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. Depending on what you plan to do with your sentence-as-a-list, you may want to look at the Natural Language Took Kit.  It deals heavily with text processing and evaluation. You can also use it to solve your problem:This has the added benefit of splitting out punctuation.Example:This allows you to filter out any punctuation you don\'t want and use only words.  Please note that the other solutions using string.split() are better if you don\'t plan on doing any complex manipulation of the sentance.How about this algorithm? Split text on whitespace, then trim punctuation. This carefully removes punctuation from the edge of words, without harming apostrophes inside words such as we\'re.I want my python function to split a sentence (input) and store each word in a listThe str().split() method does this, it takes a string, splits it into a list:The problem you\'re having is because of a typo, you wrote print(words) instead of print(word):Renaming the word variable to current_word, this is what you had:..when you should have done:If for some reason you want to manually construct a list in the for loop, you would use the list append() method, perhaps because you want to lower-case all words (for example):Or more a bit neater, using a list-comprehension:shlex has a .split() function. It differs from str.split() in that it does not preserve quotes and treats a quoted phrase as a single word:I think you are confused because of a typo.  Replace print(words) with print(word) inside your loop to have every word printed on a different line
