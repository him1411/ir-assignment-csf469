I was given a MySQL database file that I need to restore as a database on my Windows Server 2008 machine.I tried using MySQL Administrator, but I got the following error:The selected file was generated by\n  mysqldump and cannot be restored by\n  this application.How do I get this working?It should be as simple as running this: If the dump is of a single database you may have to add a line at the top of the file:If it was a dump of many databases, the use statements are already in there.To run these commands, open up a command prompt (in Windows) and cd to the directory where the mysql.exe executable is (you may have to look around a bit for it, it\'ll depend on how you installed mysql, i.e. standalone or as part of a package like WAMP).  Once you\'re in that directory, you should be able to just type the command as I have it above.If the database you want to restore doesn\'t already exist, you need to create it first.On the command-line, if you\'re in the same directory that contains the dumped file, use these commands (with appropriate substitutions):You simply need to run this:mysql -p -u[user] [database] < db_backup.dumpIf the dump contains multiple databases you should obmit the database name:mysql -p -u[user] < db_backup.dumpTo run these commands, open up a command prompt (in Windows) and cd to the directory where the mysql.exe executable is (you may have to look around a bit for it, it\'ll depend on how you installed mysql, i.e. standalone or as part of a package like WAMP). Once you\'re in that directory, you should be able to just type the command.look here - step 3: this way you dont need the USE statementWhen we make a dump file with mysqldump, what it contains is a big SQL script for recreating the databse contents. So we restore it by using starting up MySQL\xe2\x80\x99s command-line client:(where root is our admin user name for MySQL), and once connected to the database we need commands to create the database and read the file in to it:Details will vary according to which options were used when creating the dump file.I got it to work following these steps…Open MySQL Administrator and connect to serverSelect "Catalogs" on the leftRight click in the lower-left box and choose "Create New Schema"MySQL Administrator http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/7528/adminsx9.th.gif enlarge imageName the new schema  (example: "dbn")MySQL New Schema http://img262.imageshack.us/img262/4374/newwa4.th.gif enlarge imageOpen Windows Command Prompt (cmd)Windows Command Prompt http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/941/startef7.th.gif enlarge imageChange directory to MySQL installation folderExecute command:…where "root" is the name of the user, "dbn" is the database name, and "C:\\dbn_20080912.dump" is the path/filename of the mysqldump .dump fileMySQL dump restore command line http://img388.imageshack.us/img388/2489/cmdjx0.th.gif enlarge imageEnjoy!You can try SQLyog \'Execute SQL script\' tool to import sql/dump files. If you want to view the progress of the dump try this:pv -i 1 -p -t -e /path/to/sql/dump | mysql -u USERNAME -p DATABASE_NAMEYou\'ll of course need \'pv\' installed. This command works only on *nix.Using a 200MB dump file created on Linux to restore on Windows w/ mysql 5.5 , I had more success with theapproach from the mysql prompt than with theapproach on the command line, that caused some Error 2006 "server has gone away" (on windows)Weirdly, the service created during (mysql) install refers to a my.ini file that did not exist. I copied the "large" example file to my.ini \nwhich I already had modified with the advised increases. My values areYou cannot use the Restore menu in MySQL Admin if the backup / dump wasn\'t created from there. It\'s worth a shot though. If you choose to "ignore errors" with the checkbox for that, it will say it completed successfully, although it clearly exits with only a fraction of rows imported...this is with a dump, mind you.As a specific example of a previous answer:I needed to restore a backup so I could import/migrate it into SQL Server.  I installed MySql only, but did not register it as a service or add it to my path as I don\'t have the need to keep it running.  I used windows explorer to put my dump file in C:\\code\\dump.sql.  Then opened MySql from the start menu item. Created the DB, then ran the source command with the full path like so:You can also use the restore menu in MySQL Administrator. You just have to open the back-up file, and then click the restore button.
