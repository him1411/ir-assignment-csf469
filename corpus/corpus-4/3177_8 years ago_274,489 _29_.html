How do I go about binding a function to left and right arrow keys in Javascript and/or jQuery? I looked at the js-hotkey plugin for jQuery (wraps the built-in bind function to add an argument to recognize specific keys), but it doesn\'t seem to support arrow keys.Put your custom code for the arrow keys between the corresponding case and break lines. e.which is normalized by jQuery, so it works in all browsers. For a pure javascript approach, replace the first two lines with:(edit 2017)\nIf you feel fancy, you can use e.key instead of e.which or e.keyCode now. e.key is becoming a recommended standard, allowing you to check against strings: \'ArrowLeft\', \'ArrowUp\', \'ArrowRight\', \'ArrowDown\'. New browsers support it natively, check here.Character codes:37 - left38 - up39 - right40 - downYou can use the keyCode of the arrow keys (37, 38, 39 and 40 for left, up, right and down):Check the above example here.This is a bit late, but HotKeys has a very major bug which causes events to get executed multiple times if you attach more than one hotkey to an element.  Just use plain jQuery.I\'ve simply combined the best bits from the other answers:You can use KeyboardJS. I wrote the library for tasks just like this.Checkout the library here => http://robertwhurst.github.com/KeyboardJS/Are you sure jQuery.HotKeys doesn\'t support the arrow keys? I\'ve messed around with their demo before and observed left, right, up, and down working when I tested it in IE7, Firefox 3.5.2, and Google Chrome 2.0.172...EDIT: It appears jquery.hotkeys has been relocated to Github: https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeysA terse solution using plain Javascript (thanks to Sygmoral for suggested improvements):Also see https://stackoverflow.com/a/17929007/1397061.Instead of using return false; as in the examples above, you can use e.preventDefault(); which does the same but is easier to understand and read.You can use jQuery bind:You can check wether an arrow key is pressed by:prevent arrow only available for any object else SELECT, well actually i haven\'t tes on another object LOL.\nbut it can stop arrow event on page and input type.i already try to block arrow left and right to change the value of SELECT object using "e.preventDefault()" or "return false" on "kepress" "keydown" and "keyup" event but it still change the object value. but the event still tell you that arrow was pressed.A robust Javascript library for capturing keyboard input and key combinations entered. It has no dependencies.  http://jaywcjlove.github.io/hotkeys/I came here looking for a simple way to let the user, when focused on an input, use the arrow keys to +1 or -1 a numeric input. I never found a good answer but made the following code that seems to work great - making this site-wide now.Example of pure js with going right or leftWith coffee & Jquery
