I have a project with multiple branches. I\'ve been pushing them to GitHub, and now that someone else is working on them I need to do a pull from GitHub. It works fine in master. But say I have branch xyz. How can I pull branch xyz from GitHub and merge it into branch xyz on my localhost?I actually have my answer here:\nPush and pull branches in GitBut I get an error "! [rejected]" and something about "non fast forward".Any suggestions?But I get an error "! [rejected]" and something about "non fast forward"That\'s because Git can\'t merge the changes from the branches into your current master. Let\'s say you\'ve checked out branch master, and you want to merge in the remote branch other-branch. When you do this:Git is basically doing this:That is, a pull is just a fetch followed by a merge. However, when pull-ing, Git will only merge other-branch if it can perform a fast-forward merge. A fast-forward merge is a merge in which the head of the branch you are trying to merge into is a direct descendent of the head of the branch you want to merge. For example, if you have this history tree, then merging other-branch would result in a fast-forward merge:However, this would not be a fast-forward merge:To solve your problem, first fetch the remote branch:Then merge it into your current branch (I\'ll assume that\'s master), and fix any merge conflicts:Simply track your remote branches explicitly and a simple git pull will do just what you want:Or even more fitting in with the GitHub documentation on forking:You could pull a branch to a branch with the following commands.When you are on the master branch you also could first checkout a branch like:This creates a new branch, "xyz", from the master and directly checks it out.Then you do:This pulls the new branch to your local xyz branch.The best way is:git fetch will grab the latest list of branches.Now you can git checkout MyNewBranch Done :)For more info see docs: git fetchI am not sure I fully understand the problem, but pulling an existing branch is done like this (at least it works for me :)This is assuming that your local branch is created off of the origin/BRANCH.This helped me to get remote branch before merging it into other:you may also dofix merge conflicts  if any-r is for rebase.\nThis will make you branch structure fromtoThis will lead to a cleaner history. \nNote: In case you have already pushed your other-branch to origin( or any other remote), you may have to force push your branch after rebase.
