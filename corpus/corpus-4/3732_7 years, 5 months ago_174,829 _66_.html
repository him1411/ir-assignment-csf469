This is probably a pretty easy to answer question, but I can\'t find the solution myself after a couple hours of searching the documentation and Google. I set the orientation of my Android app to landscape in the AndroidManifest.xml file:However, when I run the app in the simulator, it appears sideways and in portrait mode. How can I switch the emulator to landscape mode on a mac? It\'s running the 1.6 SDK. Try:For Mac users, you only need to use the fn key if the setting "Use all F1, F2 etc. keys as function keys" (under System Preferences -> Keyboard) is checked.Not sure about your question - "sideways" is the same as "landscape".If you mean how to switch during runtime:From docs.Just use 9 in numeric keyboard with num-lock off.7 rotates in the opposite  direction.Ctrl+F11 or Ctrl+F12  to change the orientation of the android emulator on windows Android Emulator ShortcutsCtrl+F11 Switch layout orientation portrait/landscape backwardsCtrl+F12 Switch layout orientation portrait/landscape forwardsHome Home ButtonF2 Left Softkey / Menu / Settings button (or Page up)Shift+f2 Right Softkey / Star button (or Page down)Esc Back ButtonF3 Call/ dial ButtonF4 Hang up / end call buttonF5 Search ButtonCtrl+F5 Volume up (or + on numeric keyboard with Num Lock off) Ctrl+F6 Volume down (or + on numeric keyboard with Num Lock off) F7 Power Button Ctrl+F3 Camera ButtonCtrl+F11 Switch layout orientation portrait/landscape backwardsCtrl+F12 Switch layout orientation portrait/landscape forwardsF8 Toggle cell networkF9 Toggle code profilingAlt+Enter Toggle fullscreen modeF6 Toggle trackball modeOn iMac with long keyboard (keyboard with numeric keypad at the right):I\'m using Android Studio and none of the suggestions worked.  I can turn the emulator but it stays in portrait.  I didn\'t want to add a command in the manifest forcing landscape.  The fix for me was:1) turn the emulator to landscape mode using ctrl-F11 (the image will still be in portrait though)\n2) Open up the camera in the os, it opens up in landscape mode, the only app that does this\n3) without doing anything else, debug my app from Android Studio and now it shows up in landscapeCtrl + F11 works wonderfully on Ubuntu / Linux Mint.following for different plateformWINDOWS: Ctrl + F12LINUX: Ctrl + F12MAC OS X: control + F12 (or fn + control + F12, depending on your keyboard configuration)The complete listing is buried in the android docs, and i only found it via google / dogpile.\nhttp://developer.android.com/tools/help/emulator.html\n\nThat link has the emulator shortcut keys as of right now.\n\n=\\\nI have found that sometimes the CTRL + F11 combination just doesn\'t do it for me.\nI have solved it by disabling the keyboard input in the emulator settings.To do that, go to your emulator settings, klick the "show advanced settings" button and scroll all the way down. Then, disable the "enable keyboard input" option.After doing that, try to start your emulator again, and the CTRL + F11 combination should work.for windows try left Ctrl key with F11 or F12 or Num off 7To rotate the Android Emulator, just disable the Num Lock key and and use the 7 and the 9 in the num pad to rotate the emulator and change its layout from portrait to landscape.Just an little bug(Bug for me) i found on mac emulator.On changing the orientation to landscape(ctrl+cmd+f11) it changes to landscape but  content shows in portrait format.for that:Go to emulator: Settings-> Display->When device is rotated->Rotate the contents of the screenHope it helps some one. This is now much more intuitive. The AVD interface now includes a sidebar with various functional shortcuts. The buttons circled in blue will rotate the device clockwise and counterclockwise on the screen.control+fn+F11 will do. There\'s no need for "command" keyIn my windows-8 laptop, ctrl + fn + F11 works.Ctrl + F12 also works well on linux(ubuntu).make sure that your hardware keyboard is enable while creating your AVD-launch the emulator\n-install your app\n-launch your app\n-make sure that your Num lock is on\n-Press \'7\' &\'9\' from your num pad to change your orientation landscape to portrait & portrait to landscape.For those of you with a Chromebook Pixel/Ubuntu/Crouton with no numpad, installing the onboard keyboard worked for me. Just press 123 to access the numpad layout, and then press 7If you\'re on Unity already, onboard may already be installed, so just type onboard from your command line to see if it\'s there. If not, just type: PS: The Chromebook Pixel\'s upper keys were supposed to represent the traditional F1 through F11 function keys on Ubuntu/Crouton, so you may want to try those special hardware keys first (on their own or in combination with Ctrl). It\'s just that for me, I\'m running an old copy of Crouton, and the only function key that seems to be recognized is F6 To switch to Landscape mode in android emulator u have 2 ways to accomplish.1> You can create a relative layout such that when you switch from one mode to other it will change accordingly2> You can create 2 separate XML file both the views and use it whenever required
