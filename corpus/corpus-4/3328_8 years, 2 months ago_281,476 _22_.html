I need something simple like date, but in seconds since 1970 instead of the current date, hours, minutes, and seconds.date doesn\'t seem to offer that option. Is there an easy way?This should work:Just to add.\n If you want to get the seconds since epoch(Jan 1 1970) for any given date(e.g Oct 21 1973).\n Convert the number of seconds back to date\n  The command date is pretty versatile. Another cool thing you can do with date(shamelessly copied from date --help).\n  Show the local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast of the USBetter yet, take some time to read the man page \nhttp://www.manpages.info/linux/date.1.htmlSo far, all the answers use the external program date.Since Bash 4.2, printf has a new modifier %(dateformat)T that, when used with argument -1 outputs the current date with format given by dateformat, handled by strftime(3) (man 3 strftime for informations about the formats).So, for a pure Bash solution:or if you need to store the result in a variable var:No external programs and no subshells!Since Bash 4.3, it\'s even possible to not specify the -1:(but it might be wiser to always give the argument -1 nonetheless).If you use -2 as argument instead of -1, Bash will use the time the shell was started instead of the current date (but why would you want this?).This is an extension to what @pellucide has done, but for Macs:To determine the number of seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970) for any given date (e.g. Oct 21 1973)Please note, that for completeness, I have added the time part to the format. The reason being is that date will take whatever date part you gave it and add the current time to the value provided. For example, if you execute the above command at 4:19PM, without the \'00:00:00\' part, it will add the time automatically. Such that "Oct 21 1973" will be parsed as "Oct 21 1973 16:19:00". That may not be what you want.To convert your timestamp back to a date:Apple\'s man page for the date implementation:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/date.1.htmlWith most Awk implementations:use this bash script (my ~/bin/epoch):
