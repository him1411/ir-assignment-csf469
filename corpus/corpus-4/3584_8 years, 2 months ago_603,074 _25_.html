Not very smart to use with DOM object.Use foreach:Will result in:Please let me know if it is not easy:If this is your dataArray:then:mootools example:You can use a mini library like objx - http://objx.googlecode.com/You can write code like this:There are more \'plugins\' available to let you handle data like this, see http://code.google.com/p/objx-plugins/wiki/PluginLibraryWith nested objects, it can be retrieve as by recursive function:where as events is json object.Copied and pasted from http://www.w3schools.com, there is no need for the JQuery overhead.RESULT: John Doe 25 Marquis Wang\'s may well be the best answer when using jQuery.Here is something quite similar in pure JavaScript, using JavaScript\'s forEach method. forEach takes a function as an argument.

Another solution to navigate through JSON documents is JSONiq (implemented in the Zorba engine), where you can write something like:You can run it on http://www.zorba-xquery.com/html/demo#AwsGMHmzDgRpkFpv8qdvMjWLvvE=
