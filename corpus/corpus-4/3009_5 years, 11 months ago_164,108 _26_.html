I have a MongoDB collection with documents in the following format:I can currently get documents that match a specific array size: This correctly returns the documents with 2 elements in the name array. However, I can\'t do a $gt command to return all documents where the name field has an array size of greater than 2:How can I select all documents with a name array of a size greater than one (preferably without having to modify the current data structure)?Update:For mongodb versions 2.2+ more efficient way to do this described by @JohnnyHK in another answer.1.Using $whereBut...Javascript executes more slowly than the native operators listed on\n  this page, but is very flexible. See the server-side processing page\n  for more information.2.Create extra field NamesArrayLength, update it with names array length and then use in queries:It will be better solution, and will work much faster (you can create index on it).There\'s a more efficient way to do this in MongoDB 2.2+ now that you can use numeric array indexes in query object keys.I believe this is the fastest query that answers your question, because it doesn\'t use an interpreted $where clause:It means "all documents except those without a name (either non existant or empty array) or with just one name."Test:You can use aggregate, too:// you add "size_of_name" to transit document and use it to filter the size of the nameNone of the above worked for me. This one did so I\'m sharing it:You can simply find whether second element exists.Try to do something like this:1 is number, if you want to fetch record greater than 50 then do ArrayName.50\nThanks.I found this solution, to find items with an array field greater than certain lengthThe first $match aggregate uses an argument thats true for all the documents.  If blank, i would get Although the above answers all work, What you originally tried to do was the correct way, however you just have the syntax backwards (switch "$size" and "$gt")..Correct:Incorrect:
