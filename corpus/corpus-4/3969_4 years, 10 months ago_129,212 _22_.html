Here\'s the content description for AngularJS page:AngularJS is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for building web-apps. Declarative templates with data-binding, MVW, MVVM, MVC, dependency injection and great testability story all implemented with pure client-side JavaScript!So what does MVW stand for?\n(Considering the MVC, MVVW, MVP etc squabble, I would guess "whatever", Model-View-Whatever =P)It stands indeed for whatever, as in whatever works for youMVC vs MVVM vs MVP. What a controversial topic that many developers\n  can spend hours and hours debating and arguing about.For several years +AngularJS was closer to MVC (or rather one of its\n  client-side variants), but over time and thanks to many refactorings\n  and api improvements, it\'s now closer to MVVM \xe2\x80\x93 the $scope object\n  could be considered the ViewModel that is being decorated by a\n  function that we call a Controller.Being able to categorize a framework and put it into one of the MV*\n  buckets has some advantages. It can help developers get more\n  comfortable with its apis by making it easier to create a mental model\n  that represents the application that is being built with the\n  framework. It can also help to establish terminology that is used by\n  developers.Having said, I\'d rather see developers build kick-ass apps that are\n  well-designed and follow separation of concerns, than see them waste\n  time arguing about MV* nonsense. And for this reason, I hereby declare\n  AngularJS to be MVW framework - Model-View-Whatever. Where Whatever\n  stands for "whatever works for you".Angular gives you a lot of flexibility to nicely separate presentation\n  logic from business logic and presentation state. Please use it fuel\n  your productivity and application maintainability rather than heated\n  discussions about things that at the end of the day don\'t matter that\n  much.For completeness, here are the acronyms mentioned:MVC  - Model-View-ControllerMVP  - Model-View-PresenterMVVM - Model-View-ViewModelMVW / MV* - Model-View-WhateverAnd some more:HMVC - Hierarchical Model-View-ControllerMMV - Multiuse Model ViewMVA  - Model-View-AdapterHaving said, I\'d rather see developers build kick-ass apps that are\n  well-designed and follow separation of concerns, than see them waste\n  time arguing about MV* nonsense.
