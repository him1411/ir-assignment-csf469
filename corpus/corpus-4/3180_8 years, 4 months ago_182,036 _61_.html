What is the intended use of the optional else clause of the try statement?The statements in the else block are executed if execution falls off the bottom of the try - if there was no exception. Honestly, I\'ve never found a need.However, Handling Exceptions notes:The use of the else clause is better\n  than adding additional code to the try\n  clause because it avoids accidentally\n  catching an exception that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\n  raised by the code being protected by\n  the try ... except statement.So, if you have a method that could, for example, throw an IOError, and you want to catch exceptions it raises, but there\'s something else you want to do if the first operation succeeds, and you don\'t want to catch an IOError from that operation, you might write something like this:If you just put another_operation_that_can_throw_ioerror() after operation_that_can_throw_ioerror, the except would catch the second call\'s errors. And if you put it after the whole try block, it\'ll always be run, and not until after the finally. The else lets you make sureThere is one big reason to use else - style and readability.  It\'s generally a good idea to keep code that can cause exceptions near the code that deals with them.  For example, compare these:andThe second one is good when the except can\'t return early, or re-throw the exception.  If possible, I would have written:Note: Answer copied from recently-posted duplicate here, hence all this "AskPassword" stuff.One use: test some code that should raise an exception.(This code should be abstracted into a more generic test in practice.)What is the intended use of the optional else clause of the try statement?The else statement runs if there are no exceptions and if not interrupted by a return, continue, or break statement. From the docs:The optional else clause is executed if and when control flows off the\n  end of the try clause.*(Bolding added.) And the footnote reads:*Currently, control \xe2\x80\x9cflows off the end\xe2\x80\x9d except in the case of an\n  exception or the execution of a return, continue, or break statement.It does require at least one preceding except clause (see the grammar). So it really isn\'t "try-else," it\'s "try-except-else(-finally)," with the else (and finally) being optional. The Python Tutorial elaborates on the intended usage:The try ... except statement has an optional else clause, which, when\n  present, must follow all except clauses. It is useful for code that\n  must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception. For\n  example:The use of the else clause is better than adding additional code to\n  the try clause because it avoids accidentally catching an exception\n  that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t raised by the code being protected by the try ... except\n  statement.If you handle an error, the else block will not run. For example:And now,I find it really useful when you\'ve got cleanup to do that has to be done even if there\'s an exception:Even though you can\'t think of a use of it right now, you can bet there has to be a use for it. Here is an unimaginative sample:With else:Without else:Here you have the variable something defined if no error is thrown. You can remove this outside the try block, but then it requires some messy detection if a variable is defined.From Errors and Exceptions # Handling exceptions - docs.python.orgThe try ... except statement has an optional else clause, which,\n  when present, must follow all except clauses. It is useful for code\n  that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception.\n  For example:The use of the else clause is better than adding additional code to\n  the try clause because it avoids accidentally catching an exception\n  that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t raised by the code being protected by the try ... except\n  statement.There\'s a nice example of try-else in PEP 380. Basically, it comes down to doing different exception handling in different parts of the algorithm.It\'s something like this:This allows you to write the exception handling code nearer to where the exception occurs.Try-except-else is great for combining the EAFP pattern with duck-typing:You might thing this na\xc3\xafve code is fine:This is a great way of accidentally hiding severe bugs in your code. I typo-ed cleanup there, but the AttributeError that would let me know is being swallowed. Worse, what if I\'d written it correctly, but the cleanup method was occasionally being passed a user type that had a misnamed attribute, causing it to silently fail half-way through and leave a file unclosed? Good luck debugging that one.Looking at Python reference it seems that else is executed after try when there\'s no exception.\nThe optional else clause is executed if and when control flows off the end of the try clause. 2 Exceptions in the else clause are not handled by the preceding except clauses.Dive into python has an example where, if I understand correctly, in try block they try to import a module, when that fails you get exception and bind default but when it works you have an option to go into else block and bind what is required (see link for the example and explanation).If you tried to do work in catch block it might throw another exception - I guess that\'s where the else block comes handy.That\'s it. The \'else\' block of a try-except clause exists for code that runs when (and only when) the tried operation succeeds. It can be used, and it can be abused.Personally, I like it and use it when appropriate. It semantically groups statements.Most answers seem to concentrate on why we can\'t just put the material in the else clause in the try clause itself. The question else clause in try statement... what is it good for specifically asks why the else clause code cannot go after the try block itself, and that question is dupped to this one, but I do not see a clear reply to that question here. I feel https://stackoverflow.com/a/3996378/1503120 excellently answers that question. I have also tried to elucidate the various significance of the various clauses at https://stackoverflow.com/a/22579805/1503120.Perhaps a use might be:Maybe this will lead you too a use.An else block can often exist to complement functionality that occurs in every except block.In this case, inconsistency_type is set in each except block, so that behaviour is complemented in the no-error case in else.Of course, I\'m describing this as a pattern that may turn up in your own code someday. In this specific case, you just set inconsistency_type to 0 before the try block anyway.I have found the try: ... else: construct useful in the situation where you are running database queries and logging the results of those queries to a separate database of the same flavour/type. Let\'s say I have lots of worker threads all handling database queries submitted to a queue Of course if you can distinguish between the possible exceptions that might be thrown, you don\'t have to use this, but if code reacting to a successful piece of code might throw the same exception as the successful piece, and you can\'t just let the second possible exception go, or return immediately on success (which would kill the thread in my case), then this does come in handy.I have found else useful for dealing with a possibly incorrect config file:The error is a mild one (most of the program still works) and the code to handle locks is small.Here is another place where I like to use this pattern:Suppose your programming logic depends on whether a dictionary has an entry with a given key. You can test the result of dict.get(key) using if... else... construct, or you can do:One of the use scenarios I can think of is unpredictable exceptions, which can be circumvented if you try again. For instance, when the operations in try block involves random numbers:But if the exception can be predicted, you should always choose validation beforehand over an exception. However, not everything can be predicted, so this code pattern has its place.The else: block is confusing and (nearly) useless.  It\'s also part of the for and while statements.Actually, even on an if-statement, the else: can be abused in truly terrible ways creating bugs that are very hard to find.Consider this.Think twice about else:.  It is generally a problem.  Avoid it except in an if-statement and even then consider documenting the else- condition to make it explicit.
