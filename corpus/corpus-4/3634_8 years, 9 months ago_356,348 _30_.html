I come from a mostly web and a little bit Windows Forms background. For a new project, we will be using WPF. The WPF application will need 10 - 20 small icons and images for illustrative purposes. I am thinking about storing these in the assembly as embedded resources. Is that the right way to go ? How do I specify in XAML that an Image control should load the image from an embedded resource ? If you will use the image in multiple places, then it\'s worth loading the image data only once into memory and then sharing it between all Image elements.To do this, create a BitmapSource  as a resource somewhere:Then, in your code, use something like:In my case, I found that I had to set the Image.png file to have a build action of Resource rather than just Content.  This causes the image to be carried within your compiled assembly.I found to be the best practice of using Images,Video,etc is:ExampleBenefits:Some people are asking about doing this in code and not getting an answer.After spending many hours searching I found a very simple method, I found no example and so I share mine here\nwhich works with images. (mine was a .gif)Summary:It returns a BitmapFrame which ImageSource "destinations" seem to like.Use:Method:Learnings:From my experiences the pack string is not the issue, check your streams and especially if reading it the first time has set the pointer\nto the end of the file and you need to re-set it to zero before reading again.I hope this saves you the many hours I wish this piece had for me!In code to load a resource in the executiong assembly where my image \'Freq.png\' was in the folder "Icons" and defined as "Resource":I also made a function if anybody can use it:Usage (assumption you put the function in a ResourceHelper class):Note: see MSDN Pack URIs in WPF : "pack://application:,,,/ReferencedAssembly;component/Subfolder/ResourceFile.xaml"yes it is the right way.\nYou could use the image in the resource file just using the path:You must set the build action of the image file to "Resource"Full description how to use resources:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970494(v=vs.100).aspx\nand how to reference them read "Pack URIs in WPF"In short, there is even means to reference resources from referenced/referencing assembliesThis worked for me:If you\'re using blend, to make it extra easy and not have any trouble getting the correct path for the Source attribute, just drag and drop the image from the Project panel onto the designer.This workedand the images to be set is resources in properties
