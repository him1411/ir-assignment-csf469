How can I gather the visitor\'s time zone information? I need the Timezone, as well as the GMT offset hours.The time-zone offset is the difference, in minutes, between UTC and local time. Note that this means that the offset is positive if the local timezone is behind UTC and negative if it is ahead.  For example, if your time zone is UTC+10 (Australian Eastern Standard Time), -600 will be returned. Daylight savings time prevents this value from being a constant even for a given localeNote that not all timezones are offset by whole hours: for example, Newfoundland is UTC minus 3h 30m (leaving Daylight Saving Time out of the equation).I realize this answer is a bit off topic but I imagine many of us looking for an answer also wanted to format the time zone for display and perhaps get the zone abbreviation too. So here it goes...If you want the client timezone nicely formatted you can rely on the JavaScript Date.toString method and do:This will give you "GMT-0400 (EST)" for example, including the timezone minutes when applicable. Alternatively, with regex you can extract any desired part:For "GMT-0400 (EDT)" :For "GMT-0400" :For just "EDT" :For just "-0400":Date.toString reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toStringUsing an offset to calculate Timezone is a wrong approach, and you will always encounter problems. Time zones and daylight saving rules may change on several occasions during a year, and It\'s difficult to keep up with changes.To get a correct timezone in JavaScript, you should use  Unfortunately, by the time of writing this, it\'s not yet widely supported.\nI know it\'s working correctly at least in Chrome. ecma-402/1.0 says that timeZone may be undefined if not provided to constructor. However, future draft (3.0) fixed that issue by changing to system default timezone.In this version of the ECMAScript Internationalization API, the\n  timeZone property will remain undefined if no timeZone property was\n  provided in the options object provided to the Intl.DateTimeFormat\n  constructor. However, applications should not rely on this, as future\n  versions may return a String value identifying the host environment\xe2\x80\x99s\n  current time zone instead.in ecma-402/3.0 which is still in a draft it changed toIn this version of the ECMAScript 2015 Internationalization API, the\n  timeZone property will be the name of the default time zone if no\n  timeZone property was provided in the options object provided to the\n  Intl.DateTimeFormat constructor. The previous version left the\n  timeZone property undefined in this case.So before using it check current support across browsers\nfor example at:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat/resolvedOptionsIt\'s already been answered how to get offset in minutes as an integer, but in case anyone wants the local GMT offset as a string e.g. "+1130":I wrote a function in my project, which returns the timezone in hh:mm format. I hope this may help someone:Working FiddleYou can use:Browser time zone detection is rather tricky to get right, as there is little information provided by the browser.Moment Timezone uses Date.getTimezoneOffset() and Date.toString() on a handful of moments around the current year to gather as much information about the browser environment as possible. It then compares that information with all the time zone data loaded and returns the closest match. In case of ties, the time zone with the city with largest population is returned.try getTimezoneOffset() of the Date object:This method returns time zone offset in minutes which is the difference between GMT and local time in minutes.With moment.js:JavaScript:This value is from user\'s machine and it can be changed anytime so I think it doesn\'t matter, I just want to get an approximate value and then convert it to GMT in my server.For example, I am from Taiwan and it returns "+8" for me.Working example JSHTMLResultWith momentjs, you can find current timezone as It returns utc offset in minutes.More InfoIf all you need is the "MST" or the "EST" time zone abbreviation:Timezone in hours-If you want to be precise as you mentioned in comment, then you should try like this-As an alternative to new Date().getTimezoneOffset() and moment().format(\'zz\'), you can also use momentjs:jstimezone is also quite buggy and unmaintained (https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetect/issues?status=new&status=open)Use this to convert OffSet to postive:This is very good work for me:you can simply try this.\nit will return you current machine timevar _d = new Date(),\n  t = 0,\n  d = new Date(t*1000 + _d.getTime())This will do the job.undefinedSee this resultant operator was opposite to the Timezone .So apply some math function then validate the num less or more.See the MDN document \nI was looking for just the 3 letter string (like "PDT") and tried Marquez\'s answer but had to tweak it a bit for cross browser support. Luckily, the string is the last potential match :)Here\'s what I did, in CoffeeScript:Works in IE8, IE9, Safari 9, Firefox 44, and Chrome 48You just to to include moment.js and jstz.js and after that
