How to convert colors in RGB format to Hex format and vice versa?For example, convert \'#0080C0\' to (0, 128, 192).The following will do to the RGB to hex conversion and add any required zero padding: Converting the other way:Finally, an alternative version of rgbToHex(), as discussed in @casablanca\'s answer and suggested in the comments by @cwolves:Here\'s a version of hexToRgb() that also parses a shorthand hex triplet such as "#03F":An alternative version of hexToRgb:Edit: 3/28/2017\nHere is another approach that seems to be even fasterEdit: 8/11/2017\nThe new approach above after more testing is not faster :(. Though it is a fun alternate way.Here\'s my version:I\'m assuming you mean HTML-style hexadecimal notation, i.e. #rrggbb. Your code is almost correct, except you\'ve got the order reversed. It should be:Also, using bit-shifts might make it a bit easier to read:This code accept #fff and #ffffff variants and opacity.Returns an array [r, g, b]. Works also with shorthand hex triplets such as "#03F".Note that this answer uses latest features of ECMAScript, which are not supported in older browsers. If you want this code to work in all environments, you should use Babel to compile your code.Warning: the following code uses padStart() method, which is currently a part of ECMAScript 2017 draft. It\'s not yet supported by all browsers (check the compatibility table). If you want to use it today, use Babel or padStart() polyfill.// Ignoring hsl notation, color values are commonly expressed as names, rgb, rgba or hex-// Hex can be 3 values or 6.// Rgb can be percentages as well as integer values.// Best to account for all of these formats, at least.One-line functional HEX to RGBASupports both short #fff and long #ffffff forms.\nSupports alpha channel (opacity).\nDoes not care if hash specified or not, works in both cases.examples:This could be used for getting colors from computed style propeties:Ref: https://github.com/k-gun/so/blob/master/so_util.js#L43If you need compare two color values (given as rgb,name color or hex value) or convert to HEX  use HTML5 canvas object.@ Tim, to add to your answer (its a little awkward fitting this into a comment).As written, I found the rgbToHex function returns a string with elements after the point and it requires that the r, g, b values fall within the range 0-255.I\'m sure this may seem obvious to most, but it took two hours for me to figure out and by then the original method had ballooned to 7 lines before I realised my problem was elsewhere. So in the interests of saving others time & hassle, here\'s my slightly amended code that checks the pre-requisites and trims off the extraneous bits of the string.May you be after something like this?displays #9687c8For 3 digits hexToRgb function of Tim Down can be improved as below:i needed a function that accepts invalid values too likergb(-255, 255, 255)\nrgb(510, 255, 255)this is a spin off of  @cwolves answer(2017) SIMPLE ES6 composable arrow functionsI can\'t resist sharing this for those who may be writing some modern functional/compositional js using ES6. Here are some slick one-liners I am using in a color module that does color interpolation for data visualization. Note that this does not handle the alpha channel at all. My version of hex2rbg:you may need remove hex.trim() if you are using IE8.e.g.  code:I came across this problem since I wanted to accept any color value and be able to add an opacity, so I made this quick jQuery plugin that uses the native canvas on modern browsers. Seems to work just great.EditTurns out I can\'t figure out how to make it a proper jQuery plugin, so I\'ll just present it as a regular function.Use these Function to achive the result without any issue. :)I\'m working with XAML data that has a hex format of #AARRGGBB (Alpha, Red, Green, Blue).  Using the answers above, here\'s my solution: http://jsfiddle.net/kvLyscs3/For convert directly from jQuery you can try:Considering a lot of answers only partially answer the question (either from RGB to HEX or the other way around) I thought I\'d post my partial answer as well.I had a similar issue and I wanted to do something like this: input any valid CSS colour (HSL(a), RGB(a), HEX or colour name) and 1. be able to add or remove an alpha value, 2. return an rgb(a) object. I wrote a plugin exactly for this purpose. It can be found on GitHub (it requires jQuery, but if you want you can fork it and make a vanilla version). Here is a demo page. You can try for yourself and see the output generated on the fly.I\'ll copy-paste the options here:RGB Generator accepts one argument, the colour, and provides three options: asObject, addAlpha and removeAlpha. When the three options are omitted, the RGB colour will be returned as a string.Note that by default alpha components are included. If the input value contains an alpha value, the output will be in RGBa format.You can disable this behaviour by setting removeAlpha to true. This will remove any alpha value from an initial HSLa or RGBa colour.If, on the other hand, you want to add an alpha channel, you can do so by setting addAlpha to any value between 0 and 1. When the input is a non-transparent colour, the alpha value will be added. If it is a transparent one, the provided value will overwrite the alpha component of the input.Finally it\'s also possible to output the RGB(a) colour as an object. It will consist of r, g, b and optionally a.The top rated answer by Tim Down provides the best solution I can see for conversion to RGB. I like this solution for Hex conversion better though because it provides the most succinct bounds checking and zero padding for conversion to Hex. The use of left shift \'<<\' and or \'|\' operators make this a fun solution too.I found this and because I think it is pretty straight forward and has validation tests and supports alpha values (optional), this will fit the case.Just comment out the regex line if you know what you\'re doing and it\'s a tiny bit faster.HTML use the hexadecimal system and the rgb uses the decimal system. so you have to convert the number from hexadecimal to decimal and vice versa.Looks like you\'re looking for something like this:A clean coffeescript version of the above (thanks @TimDown):My stupid example =)\n
