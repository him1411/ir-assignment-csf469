I have a Git repository in a folder called XXX, and I have second Git repository called YYY.I want to import the XXX repository into the YYY repository as a subdirectory named ZZZ and add all XXX\'s change history to YYY.Folder structure before:Folder structure after:Can this be done, or must I resort to using sub-modules?Probably the simplest way would be to pull the XXX stuff into a branch in YYY and then merge it into master:In YYY:I actually just tried this with a couple of my repos and it works. Unlike J\xc3\xb6rg\'s answer it won\'t let you continue to use the other repo, but I don\'t think you specified that anyway.Note: Since this was originally written in 2009, git has added the subtree merge mentioned in the answer below. I would probably use that method today, although of course this method does still work.If you want to retain the exact commit history of the second repository and therefore also retain the ability to easily merge upstream changes in the future then here is the method you want. It results in unmodified history of the subtree being imported into your repo plus one merge commit to move the merged repository to the subdirectory.You can track upstream changes like so:Git figures out on its own where the roots are before doing the merge, so you don\'t need to specify the prefix on subsequent merges.GIT 2.9+: The merge command will require the option: --allow-unrelated-histories. Thanks @stuXnet!The method in the other answer that uses read-tree and skips the merge -s ours step is effectively no different than copying the files with cp and committing the result.Original source was from github\'s "Subtree Merge" help article.There is a well-known instance of this in the Git repository itself, which is collectively known in the Git community as "the coolest merge ever" (after the subject line Linus Torvalds used in the e-mail to the Git mailinglist which describes this merge). In this case, the gitk Git GUI which now is part of Git proper, actually used to be a separate project. Linus managed to merge that repository into the Git repository in a way that The e-mail contains the steps needed to reproduce, but it is not for the faint of heart: first, Linus wrote Git, so he probably knows a bit more about it than you or me, and second, this was almost 5 years ago and Git has improved considerably since then, so maybe it is now much easier.In particular, I guess nowadays one would use a gitk submodule, in that specific case.git-subtree is a script designed for exactly this use case of merging multiple repositories into one while preserving history (and/or splitting history of subtrees, though that is seems to be irrelevant to this question). It is distributed as part of the git tree since release 1.7.11.To merge a repository <repo> at revision <rev> as subdirectory <prefix>, use git subtree add as follows:git-subtree implements the subtree merge strategy in a more user friendly manner.For your case, inside repository YYY, you would run:The simple way to do that is to use git format-patch.Assume we have 2 git repositories foo and bar.foo contains:bar contains:and we want to end-up with foo containing the bar history and these files: So to do that:And if we want to rewrite all message commits from bar we can do, eg on Linux:This will add "[bar] " at the beginning of each commit message.Based on this article, using subtree is what worked for me and only applicable history was transferred.  Posting here in case anyone needs the steps (make sure to replace the placeholders with values applicable to you):in your source repository split subfolder into a new branchgit subtree split --prefix=<source-path-to-merge> -b subtree-split-resultin your destination repo merge in the split result branchverify your changes and commitDon\'t forget to Clean up by deleting the subtree-split-result branchgit branch -D subtree-split-resultRemove the remote you added to fetch the data from source repogit remote rm merge-source-repoAdding another answer as I think this is a bit simpler. A pull of repo_dest is done into repo_to_import and then a push --set-upstream url:repo_dest master is done.This method has worked for me importing several smaller repos into a bigger one.How to import: repo1_to_import to repo_destRename or move files and dirs into desired position in original repo before you do the import. e.g. The method described at the following link inspired this answer. I liked it as it seemed more simple. BUT Beware! There be dragons! https://help.github.com/articles/importing-an-external-git-repository git push --mirror url:repo_dest pushes your local repo history and state to remote (url:repo_dest). BUT it deletes the old history and state of the remote. Fun ensues! :-EI wanted to import only some files from the other repository (XXX) in my case. The subtree was too complicated for me and the other solutions didn\'t work. This is what I did:This gives you a space-separated list of all the commits that affect the files I wanted to import (ZZZ) in reverse order (you might have to add --follow to capture renames as well). I then went into the target repository (YYY), added the other repository (XXX) as remote, did a fetch from it and finally:which adds all the commits to your branch, you\'ll thus have all the files with their history and can do whatever you want with them as if they\'ve always been in this repository.I was in a situation where I was looking for -s theirs but of course, this strategy doesn\'t exist.  My history was that I had forked a project on GitHub, and now for some reason, my local master could not be merged with upstream/master although I had made no local changes to this branch. (Really don\'t know what happened there -- I guess upstream had done some dirty pushes behind the scenes, maybe?)What I ended up doing wasSo now my master is again in sync with upstream/master (and you could repeat the above for any other branch you also want to sync similarly).See Basic example in this article and consider such mapping on repositories:After all activity described in this chapter (after merging), remove branch B-master:Then, push changes.It works for me.This function will clone remote repo into local repo dir, after merging all commits will be saved, git log will be show the original commits and proper paths:How to use:If make a little changes you can even move files/dirs of merged repo into different paths, for example:Notices\nPaths replaces via sed, so make sure it moved in proper paths after merging.\nThe --allow-unrelated-histories parameter only exists since git >= 2.9.I don\'t know of an easy way to do that.  You COULD do this:I can edit with details if that sounds appealing.I think you can do this using \'git mv\' and \'git pull\'.I\'m a fair git noob - so be careful with your main repository - but I just tried this in a temp dir and it seems to work.First - rename the structure of XXX to match how you want it to look when it\'s within YYY:Now XXX looks like this:Now use \'git pull\' to fetch the changes across:Now YYY looks like this:
