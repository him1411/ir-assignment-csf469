When I run git reset --hard HEAD, it\'s supposed to reset to a pristine version of what you pulled, as I understand it.  Unfortunately, it leaves files lying around, as a git status shows a big list of untracked files.How do you tell git "Just bring it back to EXACTLY what was in the last pull, nothing more, nothing less"?You have to use git clean -f -d to get rid of untracked files and directories in your working copy.If you have files you still want to keep:git clean -di will do an interactive clean which allows you to only delete the files/dirs you don\'t want anymore.or, zsh provides a \'gpristine\' alias:Which is really handyUser interactive approach: -i for interactive\n-f for force\n-d for directory\n-x for ignored files(add if required)\nNote: Add -n or --dry-run to just check what it will do.You might have done a soft reset at some point, you can solve this problem by doing
