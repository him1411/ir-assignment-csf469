I\'m using Firebug and have some statements like:in my page. In IE8 (probably earlier versions too) I get script errors saying \'console\' is undefined. I tried putting this at the top of my page:still I get the errors. Any way to get rid of the errors?TryAn undefined variable cannot be referred directly. However, all global variables are attributes of the same name of the global context (window in case of browsers), and accessing an undefined attribute is fine.Or use if (typeof console === \'undefined\') console = ... if you want to avoid the magic variable window, see @Tim Down\'s answer.Paste the following at the top of your JavaScript (before using the console):The function closure wrapper is to scope the variables as to not define any variables. This guards against both undefined console and undefined console.debug (and other missing methods).EDIT: I noticed that HTML5 Boilerplate uses similar code in its js/plugins.js file, if you\'re looking for a solution that will (probably) be kept up-to-date.Another alternative is the typeof operator:Yet another alternative is to use a logging library, such as my own log4javascript.For a more robust solution, use this piece of code (taken from twitter\'s source code):In my scripts, I either use the shorthand:or, if it\'s not possible or feasible  to edit every console.log line, I create a fake console:You can use console.log() if you have Developer Tools in IE8 opened and also you can use the Console textbox on script tab.I am only using console.log in my code.  So I include a very short 2 linerBased on two previous answers byand the documentations forHere\'s a best effort implementation for the issue, meaning if there\'s a console.log which actually exists, it fills in the gaps for non-existing methods via console.log.For example for IE6/7 you can replace logging with alert (stupid but works) and then include the below monster (I called it console.js):\n[Feel free to remove comments as you see fit, I left them in for reference, a minimizer can tackle them]:and console.js:In IE9, if console is not opened, this code:will show "object", but this codewill throw TypeError exception, but not return undefined value;So, guaranteed version of code will look similar to this:Noticed that OP is using Firebug with IE, so assume it\'s Firebug Lite.  This is a funky situation as console gets defined in IE when the debugger window is opened, but what happens when Firebug is already running?  Not sure, but perhaps the "firebugx.js" method might be a good way to test in this situation:source:https://code.google.com/p/fbug/source/browse/branches/firebug1.2/lite/firebugx.js?r=187(updated links 12/2014)I\'m using fauxconsole; I modified the css a bit so that it looks nicer but works very well.For .error() reference visit http://api.jquery.com/error/For debugging in IE, check out this log4javascriptFor IE8 or console support limited to console.log (no debug, trace, ...) you can do the following:If console OR console.log undefined: Create dummy functions for\nconsole functions (trace, debug, log, ...)window.console = {\n      debug : function() {}, ...};Else if console.log is defined (IE8) AND console.debug (any other) is not defined: redirect all logging functions to console.log, this allows to keep those logs !window.console = {\n          debug : window.console.log, ...};Not sure about the assert support in various IE versions, but any suggestions are welcome. Also posted this answer here: How can I use console logging in Internet Explorer?You can use the below to give an extra degree of insurance that you\'ve got all bases covered.  Using typeof first will avoid any undefined errors.  Using === will also ensure that the name of the type is actually the string "undefined".  Finally, you\'ll want to add a parameter to the function signature (I chose logMsg arbitrarily) to ensure consistency, since you do pass whatever you want printed to the console to the log function.  This also keep you intellisense accurate and avoids any warnings/errors in your JS aware IDE.Sometimes console will work in IE8/9 but fail at other times. This erratic behaviour depends on whether you have developer tools open and is described in stackoverflow question Does IE9 support console.log, and is it a real function?Encountered similar problem running console.log in child windows in IE9, created by window.open function. It seems that in this case console is defined only in parent window and is undefined in child windows until you refresh them. Same applies to children of child windows. I deal with this issue by wrapping log in next function (below is fragment of module)Stub of console in TypeScript:After having oh so many problems with this thing (it\'s hard to debug the error since if you open the developer console the error no longer happens!) I decided to make an overkill code to never have to bother with this ever again:Personaly I only ever use console.log and console.error, but this code handles all the other functions as shown in the Mozzila Developer Network: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console.\nJust put that code on the top of your page and you are done forever with this.You can use console.log(...) directly in Firefox but not in IEs. In IEs you have to use window.console.
