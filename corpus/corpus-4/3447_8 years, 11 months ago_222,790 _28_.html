I have a trivial console application in .NET. It\'s just a test part of a larger application. I\'d like to specify the "exit code" of my console application. How do I do this?You can return it from Main if you declare your Main method to return int, or call Environment.Exit(code).In addition to the answers covering the return int\'s... a plea for sanity. Please, please define your exit codes in an enum, with Flags if appropriate. It makes debugging and maintenance so much easier (and, as a bonus, you can easily print out the exit codes on your help screen - you do have one of those, right?).If you are going to use the method suggested by David, you should also take a look at the [Flags] Attribute.This allows you to do bit wise operations on enums.Thenwould be 16 + 32. :)There are three methods that you can use to return an exit code from a console application.An important standard that should be observed is that 0 represents \'Success\'.On a related topic, consider using an enumeration to define the exit codes that your application is going to return. The FlagsAttribute will allow you to return a combination of codes.Also, ensure that your application is compiled as a \'Console Application\'.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.environment.exitcode.aspxUse ExitCode if your main has a void return signature, otherwise you need to "set" it by the value you return.Environment.ExitCode PropertyIf the Main method returns void, you can use this property to set the exit code that will be returned to the calling environment. If Main does not return void, this property is ignored. The initial value of this property is zero. Just return the appropiate code from main.The enumeration option is excellent however can be improved upon by multiplying the numbers as in:In the case of multiple errors, adding the specific error numbers together will give you a unique number that will represent the combination of detected errors.For example, an errorlevel of 6 can only consist of errors 4 and 2, 12 can only consist of errors 4 and 8, 14 can only consist of 2, 4 and 8 etc. As an update to Scott Munro\'s answer:My 2 cents:You can find the system error codes here:\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681382(v=vs.85).aspxYou will find the typical codes like 2 for "file not found" or 5 for "access denied".And when you stumble on an unknown code, you can use this command to find out what it means:e.g. net helpmsg 1returns Incorrect function
