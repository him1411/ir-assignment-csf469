I want to get a list of the column headers from a pandas DataFrame.  The DataFrame will come from user input so I won\'t know how many columns there will be or what they will be called.For example, if I\'m given a DataFrame like this:I would want to get a list like this:You can get the values as a list by doing:Also you can simply use:There is a built in method which is the most performant:.columns returns an Index, .columns.values returns an array and this has a helper function to return a list.EDITFor those who hate typing this is probably the shortest method:Did some quick tests, and perhaps unsurprisingly the built-in version using dataframe.columns.values.tolist() is the fastest:(I still really like the list(dataframe) though, so thanks EdChum!)To list the columns of a dataframe while in debugger mode, use a list comprehension:Its gets even simpler (by pandas 0.16.0) : will give you the column names in a nice list.That\'s available as my_dataframe.columns.It\'s interesting but df.columns.values.tolist() is almost 3 times faster then df.columns.tolist() but I thought that they are the same:pandas docs: Iteration over dataframes return column labelsFor data exploration in the IPython notebook, my preferred way is this:Which will produce an easy to read alphabetically ordered list.In code I find it more explicit to doBecause it tells others reading your code what you are doing.simplest way is:can use index attributes
