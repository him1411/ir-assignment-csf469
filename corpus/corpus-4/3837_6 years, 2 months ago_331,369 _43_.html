I get a strange error using json_decode(). It decode correctly the data (I saw it using print_r), but when i try to access to info inside the array i get:I only tried to do: $result[\'context\'] where $result has the data returned by json_decode()How can I read values inside this array?Use the second parameter of json_decode to make it return an array:The function json_decode() returns an object by default.You can access the data like this:If you have identifiers like from-date (the hyphen would cause a PHP error when using the above method) you have to write:If you want an array you can do something like this:Or cast the object to an array:You must access it using -> since its an object.Change your code from:To:Use true as the second parameter to json_decode. This will decode the json into an associative array instead of stdObject instances:See the documentation for more details.It\'s not an array, it\'s an object of type stdClass.You can access it like this:More info here: What is stdClass in PHP?Have same problem today, solved like this:If you call json_decode($somestring) you will get an Object and you need to access like $object->key , but if u call json_decode($somestring, true) you will get an array and can access like $array[\'key\']As the Php Manual say,print_r \xe2\x80\x94 Prints human-readable information about a variableWhen we use json_decode();, we get an object of type stdClass as return type.\nThe arguments, which are to be passed inside of print_r() should either be an array or a string. Hence, we cannot pass an object inside of print_r(). I found 2 ways to deal with this. Cast the object to array.\nThis can be achieved as follows.By accessing the key of the Object\nAs mentioned earlier, when you use json_decode(); function, it returns an Object of stdClass. you can access the elements of the object with the help of -> Operator.One, can also use multiple keys to extract the sub elements incase if the object has nested arrays.Their are other options to print_r() as well, like var_dump(); and var_export();P.S : Also, If you set the second parameter of the json_decode(); to true, it will automatically convert the object to an array(); \nHere are some references: \nhttp://php.net/manual/en/function.print-r.php\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/function.var-export.phpYou can convert stdClass object to array like: stdClsss to arrayHere is the function signature:When param is false, which is default, it will return an appropriate php type. You fetch the value of that type using object.method paradigm.When param is true, it will return associative arrays.It will return NULL on error.If you want to fetch value through array, set assoc to true.When you try to access it as $result[\'context\'], you treating it as an array, the error it\'s telling you that you are actually dealing with an object, then you should access it as $result->contextinstead of using the brackets use the object operator for example my array based on database object is created like this in a class called DB:to access the information I use this code on the controller script:then to display the information I check to see if servicecalls has been set and has a count greater than 0 remember it\'s not an array I am referencing so I access the records with the object operator "->" like this:I got this error out of the blue because my facebook login suddently stopped working (I had also changed hosts) and throwed this error. The fix is really easyThe issue was in this codeBasically isset() function expect an array but instead it find an object. The simple solution is to convert PHP object to array using (array) quantifier. The following is the fixed code.Note the use off array() quantifier in first line.Change it for
