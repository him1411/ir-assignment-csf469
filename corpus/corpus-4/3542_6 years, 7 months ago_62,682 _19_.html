That\'s probably what you\'d want in most cases, but if you want to just remove that particular remote-tracking branch, you should do:(The -r is easy to forget...)Did you try: git remote prune originFrom the git remote docs:pruneDeletes all stale\n  remote-tracking branches under <name>.\n  These stale branches have already been\n  removed from the remote repository\n  referenced by <name>, but are still\n  locally available in "remotes/<name>".\n   With --dry-run option, report\n  what branches will be pruned, but do\n  not actually prune them.Don\'t forget the awesomewhich fetches and prunes all origins.In our particular case, we use Stash as our remote git repo.
