So I have found out that setting the PATH environment variable affects only the old command prompt. PowerShell seems to have different environment settings. How do I change the environment variables for PowerShell (v1)?Note:I want to make my changes permanent, so I don\'t have to set it every time I run PowerShell. Does PowerShell have a profile file? Something like Bash profile on Unix?Changing the actual environment variables can be done by\nusing the env: namespace / drive info. For example this\ncode will update the path environment variableThere are ways to make environment settings permanent but\nif you are only using them from PowerShell, it\'s probably\na lot better to use your profile to initiate the\nsettings. On startup, Powershell will run any .ps1\nfiles it finds in the WindowsPowerShell directory under\nMy Documents folder. Typically you have a profile.ps1\nfile already there. The path on my computer isIf, some time during a PowerShell session, you need to\nmodify the PATH environment variable temporarily, you can\ndo it this way:You can also modify user/system environment variables permanently (i.e. will be persistent across shell restarts) with the followingFrom the PowerShell prompt:You should then see the text:Restart your session, and the variable will be available. setx can also be used to set arbitrary variables. Type setx /? at the prompt for documentation.Before messing with your path in this way, make sure that you save a copy of your existing path by doing $env:path >> a.out in a PowerShell prompt.Although the current accepted answer works in the sense that the path variable gets permanently updated from the context of PowerShell, it doesn\'t actually update the environment variable stored in the windows registry.\nTo achieve that you can obviously use PowerShell as well:More info here: http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2011/07/23/use-powershell-to-modify-your-environmental-path.aspxIf you use PowerShell community extensions, the proper command to add a path to the environment variable path is:This sets the path for the current session and prompts the user to add it permanently. You can add this function to your default profile (Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1) usually located at %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell.Like JeanT\'s answer, I wanted an abstraction around adding to the path. Unlike JeanT\'s answer I needed it to run without user interaction. Other behavior I was looking for:In case it\'s useful, here it is:Check out my gist for the corresponding Remove-EnvPath function.All the answers suggesting a permanent change have the same problem, they break the path registry value.SetEnvironmentVariable turns the REG_EXPAND_SZ value %SystemRoot%\\system32  into a REG_SZ value of C:\\Windows\\system32Any other variables in the path are lost as well. Adding new ones using %myNewPath% wont work anymore.Here\'s a script Set-PathVariable.ps1 that I use to address this problem:I explain the problem in more detail in a blog postMost answers aren\'t addressing UAC. This covers UAC issues.\nfirst install PowerShell Community Extensions choco install pscx via http://chocolatey.org/ (you may have to restart your shell environment)then enable pscxThen use Invoke-Elevated As Jonathan Leaders mentioned here, it is important to run the command/script elevated to be able to change environment variables for \'machine\', but running some commands elevated doesn\'t have to be done with the Community Extensions, so I\'d like to modify and extend JeanT\'s answer in a way, that changing machine variables also can be performed even if the script itself isn\'t run elevated:Successfully verified with below code C#.
