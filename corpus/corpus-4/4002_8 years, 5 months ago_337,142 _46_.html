I am trying to create a simple user control that is a slider.  When I add a AjaxToolkit SliderExtender to the user control I get this (*&$#()@# error:I have tried putting a placeholder in the user control and adding the textbox and slider extender to the placeholder programmatically and I still get the error.Here is the simple code:What is the problem?First, start the code block with <%#  instead of <%=  :This changes the code block from a Response.Write code block to a databinding expression.\nSince <%# ... %> databinding expressions aren\'t code blocks, the CLR won\'t complain. Then in the code for the master page, you\'d add the following:I just ran into this problem as well but found another solution.I found that wrapping the code blocks with a asp:PlaceHolder-tag solves the problem.(The CMS I\'m using is inserting into the head-section from some code behind which restricted me from adding custom control blocks with various information like meta-tags etc so this is the only way it works for me.)I can confirm that moving the javascript with <% %> tags from the head to the form tag fixes this errorhttp://italez.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/ajaxcontroltoolkit-calendarextender-e-strana-eccezione/Place the javascript under a div tag. It\'ll work!!you can do the same functionality if you are using script manager in your page.\nyou have to just register the script like thisI had same issue in the user control. My page that was hosting the control had comments in the head tag, I removed those comments, everything worked afterwards. Some posts also suggest removing scripts from head and placing them in the body. I tried using <%#  %> with no success. Then I changed Page.Header.DataBind(); in my code behind to this.Header.DataBind(); and it worked fine.In my case, I have replaced <%= %> with <%# %>, and it worked!                     I had this problem, but not via the Header. My placeholder was in the body. So I replaced all the <%= with <%# and didand it worked.An alternative way is to have another .aspx page act as the page you want to link to.This is what the header of the Masterpage looks like:The referenced .aspx form contains your content:Finally, you need the .aspx page to tell the browser you\'re sending CSS content:I also faced the same issue. I found the solutions like following. Solution 1:\nI kept my script tag in the body.Now conflicts regarding the tags will resolve. Solution 2:We can also solve this one of the above solutions like Replace the code block with <%# instead of <%= But the problem is it will give only relative path. If you want really absolute path it won\'t work.Solution 1 works for me. Next is your choice. The "<%#" databinding technique will not directly work inside <link> tags in the <head> tag:The above code will evaluate toInstead, you should do the following (note the two double quotes inside):And you will get the desired result:I had the same problem, but it didn\'t have anything to do with JavaScript. Consider this code:In this situation you\'ll get the same error even though PlaceHolders don\'t have any harmful code blocks, it happens because of the non-server control hdnTest uses code blocks.Just add runat=server to the hdnTest and the problem is solved.Keep the java script code inside the body tagI solved an error similar to this by putting the <script> inside a contentplaceholder inside the <head> instead of putting the <script> outside the said contentplaceholder inside the <head>For some cases ResolveUrl and ResolveClientUrl works but not all times especially in case of js script files. What happens is it works for some pages but when you navigate to some other pages it might not work due to relative path of that particular page.So finally my suggestion is always do a complete recheck of your site pages for whether all your javascript references are fine or not.\nOpen your site in Google Chrome -> right click on the page -> click view source page -> HTML appears -> now click your JS hyperlinks; if its working fine it should open the js file in another browser window, otherwise it will not open.Try writing your java script code outside the head tag it will definitely work.Its resolved when i copy and paste my Java Script code to the bottom of page. In the previous its placed in HEAD tag now just before closing the form tag.Remove the part which has server tags and place it somewhere else if you want to add dynamic controls from code behindI removed my JavaScript from the head section of page and added it to the body of the page and got it workingIn my case I got this error because I was wrongly setting InnerText to a div with html inside it. Example: Tags <%= %> not works into a tag with runat="server". Move your code with <%= %> into runat="server" to an other tag (body, head, ...), or remove runat="server" from container.
