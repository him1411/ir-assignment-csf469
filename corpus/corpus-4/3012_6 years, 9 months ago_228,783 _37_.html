Consider:How can I select a random value from this array using JavaScript?I\'ve found it even simpler to add a prototype function to the Array class:Now I can get a random array element by just typing:Note that this will add a property to all arrays, so if you\'re looping over one using for..in you should use .hasOwnProperty():(That may or may not be a hassle for you.)If you\'ve already got underscore or lodash included in your project you can use _.sample.If you need to get more than one item randomly, you can pass that as a second argument in underscore:or use the _.sampleSize method in lodash:Say you want to choose a random item that is different from the last time (not really random, but still a common requirement)...Building upon the answer by @Markus, we can add another prototype function:And implement like so:If you plan on getting a random value a lot, you might want to define a function for it. First, put this in your code somewhere:Now:Code released into the public domain under the terms of the CC0 1.0 license.If you have fixed values (like a month name list) and want a one-line solutionThe second part of the array is an access operation as described in Why does [5,6,8,7][1,2] = 8 in JavaScript?This is similar to, but more general than, @Jacob Relkin\'s solution:This is ES2015:The code works by selecting a random number between 0 and the length of the array, then returning the item at that index.I\'ve found a way around the top answer\'s complications, just by concatenating the variable rand to another variable that allows that number to be displayed inside the calling of myArray[];. By deleting the new array created and toying around with it\'s complications, I\'ve come up with a working solution:The shortest version:Here is an example of how to do it:Create one random value and pass to arrayPlease try following code..var item = myArray[Math.floor(Math.random()*myArray.length)];or equivalent shorter version:var item = myArray[(Math.random()*myArray.length)|0];Sample code:If you want to write it on one line, like Pascual\'s solution, another solution would be to write it using ES6\'s find function (based on the fact, that the probability of randomly selecting one out of n items is 1/n):Use that approach for testing purposes and if there is a good reason to not save the array in a seperate variable only. Otherwise the other answers (floor(random()*length and using a seperate function) are your way to go.In my opinion, better than messing around with prototypes , or declaring it just in time, I prefer exposing it to window:Now anywhere on your app you call it like:This way you can still use for(x in array) loop properly
