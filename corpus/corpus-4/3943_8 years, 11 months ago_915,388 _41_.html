Probably a really simple one this - I\'m starting out with C# and need to add values to an array, for example:For those who have used PHP, here\'s what I\'m trying to do in C#:You can do this way -Alternatively, you can use Lists - the advantage with lists being, you don\'t need to know the array size when instantiating the list.Edit: a) for loops on List<T> are a bit more than 2 times cheaper than foreach loops on List<T>, b) Looping on array is around 2 times cheaper than looping on List<T>, c) looping on array using for is 5 times cheaper than looping on List<T> using foreach (which most of us do).If you\'re writing in C# 3, you can do it with a one-liner:This code snippet assumes that you have a using directive for System.Linq at the top of your file.On the other hand, if you\'re looking for something that can be dynamically resized, as it appears is the case for PHP (I\'ve never actually learned it), then you may want to use a List instead of an int[]. Here\'s what that code would look like:Note, however, that you cannot simply add a 401st element by setting terms[400] to a value. You\'d instead need to call Add(), like this:Answers on how to do it using an array are provided here.However, C# has a very handy thing called System.Collections :)Collections are fancy alternatives to using an array, though many of them use an array internally.For example, C# has a collection called List that functions very similar to the PHP array.You have to allocate the array first:That would be how I\'d code it.Using a List as an intermediary is the easiest way, as others have described, but since your input is an array and you don\'t just want to keep the data in a List, I presume you might be concerned about performance.The most efficient method is likely allocating a new array and then using Array.Copy or Array.CopyTo.  This is not hard if you just want to add an item to the end of the list:I can also post code for an Insert extension method that takes a destination index as input, if desired.  It\'s a little more complicated and uses the static method Array.Copy 1-2 times.Based on the answer of Thracx (I don\'t have enough points to answer):This allows to add more than just one item to the array, or just pass an array as a parameter to join two arrays.C# arrays are fixed length and always indexed. Go with Motti\'s solution:Note that this array is a dense array, a contiguous block of 400 bytes where you can drop things. If you want a dynamically sized array, use a List<int>.Neither int[] nor List<int> is an associative array -- that would be a Dictionary<> in C#.   Both arrays and lists are dense./*Output\xef\xbc\x9aValue in index 0:    400\n  Value in index 1:    400\n  Value in index 2:    400\n  Value in index 3:    400\n  Value in index 4:    400\n  Value in index 5:    400\n  Value in index 6:    400\n  Value in index 7:    400\n  Value in index 8:    400\n  Value in index 9:    400\n  */You can\'t just add an element to an array easily. You can set the element at a given position as fallen888 outlined, but I recommend to use a List<int> or a Collection<int> instead, and use ToArray() if you need it converted into an array.If you really need an array the following is probly the simplest://Just a different approachIf you don\'t know the size of the Array or already have an existing array that you are adding to. You can go about this in two ways. The first is using a generic List<T>: \nTo do this you will want convert the array to a var termsList = terms.ToList(); and use the Add method. Then when done use the var terms = termsList.ToArray(); method to convert back to an array. The second way is resizing the current array:If you are using .NET 3.5 Array.Add(...);Both of these will allow you to do it dynamically. If you will be adding lots of items then just use a List<T>. If it\'s just a couple of items then it will have better performance resizing the array. This is because you take more of a hit for creating the List<T> object.Times in ticks:3 itemsArray Resize Time: 6 List Add Time: 16400 itemsArray Resize Time: 305 List Add Time: 20very simple wayresult\n3,4,2
