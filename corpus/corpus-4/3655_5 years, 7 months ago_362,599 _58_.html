How do I get the command line builds tools installed with Xcode 4.4 / Mac OS X v10.8 (Mountain Lion) or later?Unlike Xcode 4.3 there is no installer (it\'s just a bundle).It looks like all the command line tools are there (in the bundle, under Contents/Developer), but none of the appropriate environment variables set to use them.
