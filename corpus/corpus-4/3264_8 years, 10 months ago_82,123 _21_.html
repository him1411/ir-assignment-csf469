Is there anyway to get Eclipse to automatically look for static imports? For example, now that I\'ve finally upgraded to Junit 4, I\'d like to be able to write:hit Ctrl + Shift + O and have Eclipse add:Maybe I\'m asking too much.I\'m using Eclipse Europa, which also has the Favorite preference section:  Window > Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assist > FavoritesIn mine, I have the following entries (when adding, use "New Type" and omit the .*): All but the third of those are static imports. By having those as favorites, if I type "assertT" and hit Ctrl+Space, Eclipse offers up assertThat as a suggestion, and if I pick it, it will add the proper static import to the file.If you highlight the method Assert.assertEquals(val1, val2) and hit Ctrl + Shift + M (Add Import), it will add it as a static import, at least in Eclipse 3.4.Eclipse 3.4 has a Favourites section under Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Content AssistIf you use org.junit.Assert a lot, you might find some value to adding it there.Not exactly what I wanted, but I found a workaround. In Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede),  go to Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Content Assistand check the checkbox for Use static imports (only 1.5 or higher).This will not bring in the import on an Optimize Imports, but if you do a Quick Fix (CTRL + 1) on the line it will give you the option to add the static import which is good enough.From Content assist for static importsTo get content assist proposals for static members configure your list of favorite static members on the  Opens the Favorites preference page Java > Editor > Content Assist > Favorites preference page.\n  For example, if you have added java.util.Arrays.* or org.junit.Assert.* to this list, then all static methods of this type matching the completion prefix will be added to the proposals list.Open Window \xc2\xbb Preferences \xc2\xbb Java \xc2\xbb Editor \xc2\xbb Content Assist \xc2\xbb FavoritesWith http://www.3pintech.com/products/fast-code/ plugin you could static import a class. Then all the static member will come as code assist. You might want to take a look at that.For SpringFramework Tests, I would recommend to add the below as well When you add above as new Type it automatically add .* to the package.
