JavaScript has Array.join()Does Java have anything like this? I know I can cobble something up myself with StringBuilder:...but there\'s no point in doing this if something like it is already part of the JDK.With Java 8 you can do this without any third party library.If you want to join a Collection of Strings you can use the new String.join() method:If you have a Collection with another type than String you can use the Stream API with the joining Collector:The StringJoiner class may also be useful.All the references to Apache Commons are fine (and that is what most people use) but I think the Guava equivalent, Joiner, has a much nicer API.You can do the simple join case withbut also easily deal with nulls:orand (useful enough as far as I\'m concerned to use it in preference to commons-lang), the ability to deal with Maps:which is extremely useful for debugging etc.Not out of the box, but many libraries have similar:Commons Lang:Spring:On Android you could use TextUtils class.No, there\'s no such convenience method in the standard Java API.Not surprisingly, Apache Commons provides such a thing in their StringUtils class in case you don\'t want to write it yourself.Three possibilities in Java 8:With a java 8 collector, this can be done with the following code:Also, the simplest solution in java 8:orI wrote this one (I use it for beans and exploit toString, so don\'t write Collection<String>):but Collection isn\'t supported by JSP, so for TLD I wrote:and put to .tld file:and use it in JSP files as:Code you have is right way to do it if you want to do using JDK without any external libraries. There is no simple "one-liner" that you could use in JDK. If you can use external libs, I recommend that you look into org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils class in Apache Commons library. An example of usage:An orthodox way to achieve it, is by defining a new function:Sample:Output:7, 7, 7 and Bill and Bob and Steve and [Bill] and 1,2,3 and Apple ][ and ~,~You can use the apache commons library which has a StringUtils class and a join method.Check this link: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api.2.0/org/apache/commons/lang/StringUtils.htmlNote that the link above may become obsolete over time, in which case you can just search the web for "apache commons StringUtils", which should allow you to find the latest reference.(referenced from this thread)\nJava equivalents of C# String.Format() and String.Join()Java 8 has got a StringJoiner class. But you still need to write a bit of boilerplate, because it\'s Java.You can do this:Or a one-liner (only when you do not want \'[\' and \']\')Hope this helps.You might want to try Apache Commons StringUtils join method:http://commons.apache.org/lang/api/org/apache/commons/lang/StringUtils.html#join(java.util.Iterator, java.lang.String)I\'ve found that Apache StringUtils picks up jdk\'s slack ;-)If you\'re using Eclipse Collections (formerly GS Collections), you can use the makeString() method.If you can convert your List to an Eclipse Collections type, then you can get rid of the adapter.If you just want a comma separated string, you can use the version of makeString() that takes no parameters.Note: I am a committer for Eclipse Collections.Google\'s Guava API also has .join(), although (as should be obvious with the other replies), Apache Commons is pretty much the standard here.EDITI also notice the  toString() underlying implementation issue, and about the element containing the separator but I thought I was being paranoid. Since I\'ve got two comments on that regard, I\'m changing my answer to:Which looks pretty similar to the original question.So if you don\'t feel like adding the whole jar to your project you may use this. I think there\'s nothing wrong with your original code. Actually, the alternative that everyone\'s is suggesting looks almost the same ( although it does a number of additional validations ) Here it is, along with the  Apache 2.0 license.Now we know, thank you open sourceA fun way to do it with pure JDK, in one duty line:Output:Bill and Bob and Steve and [Bill] and 1,2,3 and Apple ][A not too perfect & not too fun way!Output:7, 7, 7 and Bill and Bob and Steve and [Bill] and 1,2,3 and Apple ][You can use this from Spring Framework\'s StringUtils. I know it\'s already been mentioned, but you can actually just take this code and it works immediately, without needing Spring for it.Try this:
