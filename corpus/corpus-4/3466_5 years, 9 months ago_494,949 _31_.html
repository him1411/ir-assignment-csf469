I have two shell scripts, a.sh and b.sh.How can I call b.sh from within the shell script a.sh?There are a couple of ways you can do this:Make the other script executable, add the #!/bin/bash line at the top, and the path where the file is to the $PATH environment variable. Then you can call it as a normal command.Call it with the source command (alias is .) like this: source /path/to/script.Use the bash command to execute it: /bin/bash /path/to/script.The first and third methods execute the script as another process, so variables and functions in the other script will not be accessible.\nThe second method executes the script in the first script\'s process, and pulls in variables and functions from the other script so they are usable from the calling script. In the second method, if you are using exit in second script, it will exit the first script as well. Which will not happen in first and third methods.Check this out.The answer which I was looking for:As mentioned, exec replaces the shell without creating a new process. However, we can put it in a subshell, which is done using the parantheses. EDIT:\nActually ( "path/to/script" ) is enough.There are a couple of ways you can do this. Terminal to execute the script:All this is correct for the path with spaces!!!Depends on.\nBriefly...\nIf you want load variables on current console and execute you may use source myshellfile.sh on your code. Example:If you just want to execute a file and the only thing intersting for you is the result, you can do:I hope helps you.\nThanks.You can use /bin/sh to call or execute another script (via your actual script):The output would be:First you have to include the file you call:then you call your function like this:Just add in a line whatever you would have typed in a terminal to execute the script!\ne.g.:if the script to be executed is not in same directory, just use the complete path of the script.\ne.g.:`/home/user/script-directory/./myscript.sh &Assume the new file is "/home/satya/app/app_specific_env" and the file contents are as followsAppend this file reference to ~/.bashrc fileWhen ever you restart the machine or relogin, try echo $FAV_NUMBER in the terminal. It will output the value. Just in case if you want to see the effect right away, source ~/.bashrc in the command line.Simple source will help you.\nFor Ex.There are some problems to import functions from other file.\nFirst: You needn\'t to do this file executable. Better not to do so!\njust add to import all functions. And all of them will be as if they are defined in your file.\nSecond: You may be define the function with the same name. It will be overwritten. It\'s bad. You may declare like thatand only after that do import.\nSo you may call old function by new name.\nThird: You may import only full list of functions defined in file.\nIf some not needed you may unset them. But if you rewrite your functions after unset they will be lost. But if you set reference to it as described above you may restore after unset with the same name.\nFinally In common procedure of import is dangerous and not so simple. Be careful! You may write script to do this more easier and safe.\nIf you use only part of functions(not all) better split them in different files. Unfortunately this technique not made well in bash. In python for example and some other script languages it\'s  easy and safe. Possible to make partial import only needed functions with its own names. We all want that in next bush versions will be done the same functionality. But now We must write many additional cod so as to do what you want.
