I\'ve just upgraded my app to use the newly released v22.1.0 AppCompat and I\'m now getting the following exception when I open my app.How do I fix it?AppCompat is now more strict on what it expect in theme window flags, more closely matching what you would get from the framework.The main reason behind this is to support AppCompatDialogs which we were also adding in this release. They make heavy use of the windowNoTitle flag, which AppCompat previously didn\'t pay much attention to.So to fix your issue you have two options:The easy way is to just use Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar as your parent theme. This will always do the right thing.If you can\'t do that though (maybe you need to support action bar and no action bar), you should do the following:You should be back on track now.Those who\'re still getting error after all of those fix. Please inherit from and don\'t use Then, you won\'t get any error.I added    but it wasnt enough. \nFinally, moving super.onCreate before setContentView in Activity - fixed my issue :) Just use this in your style.xml in values-v21 folder no other editing is neededDon\'t add anything in to activity file please leave it
