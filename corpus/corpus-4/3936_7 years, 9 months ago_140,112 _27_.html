I\'m using two ListViews like this:There is one blank line between the two ListViews. How do I remove it?To remove the separator between items in the same ListView, here is the solution:developer.android.com # ListViewOr, if you want to do it in XML:If you want to remove a divider line, use this code:If you want to add a space instead of a divider line:So, you can use any drawable or color in the divider attribute.There are different ways to achieve this, but I\'m not sure which one is the best (I don\'t even know is there is a best way). I know at least two different ways to do this in a ListView:1. Set divider to null:1.1. Programmatically1.2. XMLThis goes inside your ListView element.2. Set divider to transparent and set its height to 0 to avoid adding space between listview elements:2.1. Programmatically:2.2. XMLIn XML:Or in Java:You can put below property in listview tag(or)\nprogrammatically listview.Divider(null);\nhere listview is ListView reference.Or in XML:You can use a color for the drawable (e.g. #ff112233), but be aware, that pre-cupcake releases have a bug in which the color cannot be set. Instead a 9-patch or a image must be used..You can try the following. It worked for me...I find it easier to implement it in the XML file as it can be harder to trace the line of code in a class with hundreds of lines.\nFor the XML you can use "null":For ListFragment useafter the list has been obtained.If this android:divider="@null" doesn\'t work, maybe changing your ListViews for Recycler Views?\xc2\xa0
