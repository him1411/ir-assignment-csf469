Is there any way to copy all lines from open file to clipboard in VI editor. I tried yG but it\'s not using clipboard to store those lines. So is it possible?You should yank the text to the * or + registers:gg"*yGExplanation: Use::%y+to yank all lines.Explanation:NB: In Windows, + and * are equivalent see this answer.on Maccopy selected part: visually select text(type v or V in normal\nmode) and type :w !pbcopycopy the whole file :%w !pbcopypast from the clipboard :r !pbpasteThe clipboard is buffer +. To copy to clipboard, do "+y and [movement].So, gg"+yG will copy the whole file.Similarly, to paste from clipboard, "+pThis is what I do to yank the whole file:(in reply to @rshdev, and to avoid having to recompile vim with +xterm_clipboard per @nelstrom in comments on OP)there\'s a program called xclip that works like putclip on Ubuntu 11:it\'s not installed by default.  to install, use:On Ubuntu 12 you might try to install the package vim-gnomeI tried it, becausetold me that it would have the flag xterm_clipboard disabled (indicated by - ), which is needed in order to use the clipboard functionality.-> installing the vim-gnome package on Ubuntu 12 also installed a console based version of vim, that has this option enabled (indicated by a + before the xterm_clipboard flag)Another easy way to copy the entire file if you\'re having problems using VI, is just by typing "cat filename".  It will echo the file to screen and then you can just scroll up and down and copy/paste.you can press gg to locate your curser to the start of the file,then press yG to copy all the content from the start to end(G located) to buffer.good luck!If you\'re using Vim in visual mode, the standard cut and paste keys also apply, at least with Windows.Under Ubuntu terminal (Gnome) at least, the standard copy also works (CTRLSHIFTC, although there doesn\'t appear to be a standard keyboard shortcut for select all (other than ALTE followed by A).I tried a few of the commands that people have mentioned above. None worked.\nThen I got hold of the simplest of them all.  Step 1: vi <filename>\nStep 2: Right click on the title bar of the Putty window\nStep 3: Select "Clear scrollback" (to avoid copying the rest of your SSH session)\nStep 4: Right click again and select "Copy all to clipboard".  :%y a Yanks all the content into vim\'s buffer,\nPressing p in command mode will paste the yanked content after the line that your cursor is currently standing at.There wasn\'t a concept of "clipboard" in Bill Joy\'s vi so I don\'t think there is a built-in way to do it.gVim\'s automatic copy-anything-highlighted-to-the-clipboard feature is easiest or use an external program via :!For Cygwin\'s vim I use Maybe Ubuntu has a CLI app like putclip??ggVGSee :help go-a:Well, all of these approaches are interesting, however as lazy programmer I use yank all line by using combination of number + yfor example you have source code file with total of 78 lines, you can do as below:If your fingers default to CTRL-A CTRL-C, then try the mappings from $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim.I have them mapped to <Leader><C-a> and <Leader><C-c>.Here\'s a map command to select all to the clipboard using CTRL+a:Add it to your .vimrc and you\'re good to go...Click the left mouse button, drag across the section you want to copy and release. The code automatically gets copied to clipboard.
