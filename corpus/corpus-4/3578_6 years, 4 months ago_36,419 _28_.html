A project on GitHub that I have a fork of has a new pull requests that I want to pull into my fork that the author has not pulled in yet.Is there a simple way to apply pull request from other forks into my fork? Is there something else here that I am missing?You can do it manually quite easily:add the other fork as a remote of your repo: fetch his repo\'s commitsYou have then  two options to apply the pull request (if you don\'t want to choose pick 1.)If you don\'t care about applying also the eventual commits that have been added between the origin and the pull request, you can just rebase the branch on which the pull request was formedIf you only want the commits in the pull request, identify their SHA1 and doYou can also do this via the github webpage.I assume, you should have already a fork (MyFork) of the common repo (BaseRepo) which has the pending pull request from a fork (OtherFork) you are interested in.Now you should have a pending pull request in your fork (MyFork), which you can simply accept.Like Tekkub said previously, you can just pull the branch in directly. Most of the time with GitHub, the branch is simply "master" on the requesting User\'s fork of the project.Example: git pull https://github.com/USER/PROJECT/ BRANCHSome more detailed info that worked for me.My .git/config file for the forked repo looks like this:Then run "git fetch source", which then listed all the pull requests from the forked repo.And then to merge in a specific pull request run "git merge  master origin/pr/67"What I would do is the following;I have now merged the changes into a test branch, named test_fork. So that any changes won\'t dirty my tree.Optionally you can use cherry-pick as described above to pick a particular commit if that is more preferable.Happy travels :)Pull requests for the project may come from many different authors (forks), and you probably don\'t want a separate remote for each fork.  Also, you don\'t want to make any assumptions about the branch the author used when submitting the pull request, or what else might be in the author\'s master branch.  So it\'s better to reference the pull request as it appears in the upstream repository, rather than as it appears in the other forks.Step 1:You\'ve probably already done this step, but if not, you\'ll want a remote defined for the upstream project.  The URL is the clone URL of the project you forked.  More info at Configuring a remote for a fork and Syncing a fork.  upstream is the name you are giving to the remote, and while it can be anything,  upstream is the conventional name.Step 2:... where {id} is the pull request number.    upstream is the name of the remote to pull from, i.e. just "upstream" if you followed step 1 exactly.  It can also be a URL, in which case you can skip step 1.Step 3:Type in a commit message for the merge commit.  You can keep the default, although I recommend giving a nice one-line summary with the pull request number, the issue it fixes, and a short description:
