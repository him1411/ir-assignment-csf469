How do I delete SharedPreferences data for my application?I\'m creating an application that uses a lot of web services to sync data. For testing purposes I need to wipe out some SharedPreferences values when I restart the app.To remove specific values: SharedPreferences.Editor.remove() followed by a commit()To remove them all SharedPreferences.Editor.clear() followed by a commit()If you don\'t care about the return value and you\'re using this from your application\'s main thread, consider using apply() instead.My solution:Removing all preferences:Removing single preference:If it\'s not necessary to be removed every time, you can remove it manually from:\nSettings -> Applications -> Manage applications -> (choose your app) -> Clear data or UninstallDeleting Android Shared Preferences in one line :-)Or apply for non-blocking asynchronous operation:You can use the adb shell to do this even without a rooted phone. The only catch is that the app must be debuggable.For example:Alternatively, you can just do the above but without the command which will direct you to the app package root and allow you to execute more commands in the app\'s context.Seems that all solution is not completely working or out-dead to clear all SharedPreferences in an Activity Call this from the Main Activity after onCreate note* i used instead of you are free to choose commit();Try this code: // clear them allYou can also just manually uninstall your app using your device. Then when you re-install your app, shared preferences have been reset.in the class definitionsinside the classAs of API 24 (Nougat) you can just do:However, there is no backward compatibility, so if you\'re supporting anything less than 24, stick with:To Clear all SharedPreferences centrally from any class:An then from any class:(Commit return Boolean whhere you can check whether your Preferences cleared or not)Or: you can use Apply: it returns void\n            Navigation.getEditor(this).clear().apply();You can use-> preferences.edit().remove("key").commit(); to delete saved value from shared preferences.Just did this this morning.  From a command prompt:NOTE: This requires a rooted device such as the stock Android virtual devices, a Genymotion device, or an actual rooted handset/tablet, etc.The fastest way to do this while you are developing/testing would be toadb uninstall Example:\n$ adb uninstall com.example.myappname
