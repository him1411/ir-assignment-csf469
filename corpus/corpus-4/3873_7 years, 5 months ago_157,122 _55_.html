I would like to inset the text of a UITextField. Is this possible? Thanks.Overriding -textRectForBounds: will only change the inset of the placeholder text. To change the inset of the editable text, you need to also override -editingRectForBounds:I was able to do it through:Of course remember to import QuartzCore and also add the Framework to your project.In a class derived from UITextField, override at least this two methods:It might be as simple as this if you have no additional content:UITextField provides several positioning methods you can override.If you need just a left margin, you can try this:It works for me. I hope this may help.How about an @IBInspectable, @IBDesignable swift class.You\'ll see this in your storyboard.Update - Swift 3If you have a clear button, the accepted answer won\'t work for you. We should also guard against Apple changing things in the future by calling super.So, to make sure the text doesn\'t overlap the clear button, let\'s get the \'default\' value from super first, then adjust as necessary.This code will add a 10px insets on the top, left and bottom of the text field:Note: UIEdgeInsetsMake takes parameters in the order: top, left, bottom, right.Using textRectForBounds: is the correct approach. I have wrapped this up in my subclass so you can simply use textEdgeInsets. See SSTextField.Thought I would supply a Swift SolutionFor people, who are searching for a easier solution.   Add the UITextField inside a UIView. To simulate an inset around text field I keep 10 px left and width is 20px less than the view. For a rounded corner border around the textfield, use the view\'s border A good approach to add padding to UITextField is to subclass UITextField and add an edgeInsets property.  You then set the edgeInsets and the UITextField will be drawn accordingly.  This will also function correctly with a custom leftView or rightView set.OSTextField.hOSTextField.mYou can set text inset for UITextField by setting the leftView.  Like this:  SwiftSwift 3 / Designable in Interface builder / Separate horizontal & vertical insects / usable out of the boxusage:&You can adjust the positioning of the text within a text field by making it a subclass of UITextField and overriding the -textRectForBounds: method.Here is the same subclassed UITextField written in Swift 3.  It is quite different from prior versions of Swift, as you\'ll see:Incidentally, you can also do something like the following, if you want to control the inset of just one side.  This particular example of adjusting only the left inset comes in handy if you place an image on top of the UITextField but you want it to appear to the user to be within the text field:Swift 3 Version for Xcode 8.3.1 as of May 2017: I subclased UITextField to handle this that supports left, top, right and bottom inset, and clear button positioning as well.MRDInsetTextField.hMRDInsetTextField.mExample of usage where *_someTextField* comes from nib/storyboard view with MRDInsetTextField custom classI did this in IB where I created a UIView Behind the textView that was a little bit longer. With the textField background color set to clear.\n I normally try avoid subclassing but this works if you have already:To throw in another solution that has no need for subclassing:\nTested with iOS 7 and iOS 8. Both working. Still there might be the chance of Apple modifying the UITextField\'s layer hierarchy screwing up things badly.This is not as short as the other examples, but takes an entirely different approach to solving this problem. Note, the caret will still begin flush to the left edge but the text will be properly indented when typed/displayed. This works without subclassing if your looking for just a left margin and you are already using UITextFieldDelegate for your text fields. You need to set both the default text attributes and the typing attributes. You set the default text attributes when you create the text field. The typing attributes you need to set in the delegate. If you are also using a placeholder you will want to set that to the same margin as well. Putting it altogether you get something like this.First create a category on the UITextField class. Then, if you are using placed holders make sure to use an attributed placeholder setting the same indent. Create a default attributed dictionary with the proper attributes, something like this:Then, import the above category and whenever you create a text field set the default indent, the delegate  and use the default placeholder attributes defined above. For example:Lastly, in the delegate, implement the textFieldDidBeginEditing method, something like this:It\'s absurd you have to subclass, since UITextField already implements the methods, as @Adam Waite points out. Here\'s a swift extension that exposes a factory method, also available in our categories repo:Here\'s a comprehensive Swift answer that includes a leftView (custom icon) and a custom clear button, both set in Interface Builder with customizable insets.If you want to change TOP and LEFT indent only then // placeholder position// text position
