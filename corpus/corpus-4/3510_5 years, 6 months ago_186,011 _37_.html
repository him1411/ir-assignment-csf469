I have ViewPager and below it I have 10 buttons. By clicking on button, for example #4, the pager goes immediately to page #4 by mPager.setCurrentItem(3);. But, I want to disable the paging by swiping with finger horizontally. Thus, the paging is done ONLY by clicking on the buttons. \nSo, how I can disable the swiping with finger?You need to subclass ViewPager.  onTouchEvent has a lot of good things in it that you don\'t want to change, like allowing child views to get touches.  onInterceptTouchEvent is what you want to change.  If you look at the code for ViewPager, you\'ll see the comment:Here\'s a complete solution:First, add this class to your src folder:Next, make sure to use this class instead of the regular ViewPager, which you probably specified as android.support.v4.view.ViewPager.  In your layout file, you\'ll want to specify it with something like:This particular example is in a LinearLayout and is meant to take up the entire screen, which is why layout_weight is 1 and layout_height is 0dp.And setMyScroller(); method is for smooth transitionThe more general extension of ViewPager would be to create a SetPagingEnabled method so that we can enable and disable paging on the fly.\nTo enable / disable the swiping, just overide two methods: onTouchEvent and onInterceptTouchEvent. Both will return "false" if the paging was disabled.Then select this instead of the built-in viewpager in XMLYou just need to call the setPagingEnabled method with false and users won\'t be able to swipe to paginate.The simplest way is to setOnTouchListener and return true for ViewPager.Better to declare it styleable, so you can change its property from xml:And in your values/attr.xml:so that you can use it in you layout xml:Of course, you can still have a get/set property.Overriding only onTouchEvent and onInterceptTouchEvent is not sufficient in case you have ViewPager itself inside another ViewPager. Child ViewPager would steel horizontal scroll touch events from parent ViewPager unless it is positioned on its first / last page.To make this setup work properly you need to override also the canScrollHorizontally method.See LockableViewPager implementation below.To disable swipe To enable swipe I needed to disable swiping on one specific page, and give it a nice rubber-band animation, here\'s how:If you are extending from ViewPager, you must also override executeKeyEvent as indicated previously by @araks Because some devices like the Galaxy Tab 4 10\' show these buttons where most devices never show them:I know it\'s mighty late to post this but here\'s a tiny hack to achieve your outcome ;)Simply add a dummy view below your viewpager:Then add a OnClickListener to your RelativeLayout.Get a bit creative with layouts, their placements and their behaviour and you\'ll learn to find a way to do absolutely anything that you imagine :)Good luck!I wrote a CustomViewPager with a swiping control:If you set canScroll to true, this ViewPager can be swiping with finger, false on the contrary.I use this in my project, and it works great until now.Try overriding and returning true from either onInterceptTouchEvent() and/or onTouchEvent(), which will consume touch events on the pager.Another easy solution to disable swiping at specific page (in this example, page 2):If you want to implement the same for Android in Xamarin, here is a translation to C#I chose to name the attribute "ScrollEnabled". Because iOS just uses the excat same naming. So, you have equal naming across both platforms, makes it easier for developers.In .axml file:
