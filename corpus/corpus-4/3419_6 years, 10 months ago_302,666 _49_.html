I have the following code to display a textbox in a HTML webpage.When the page displays, the text contains the Please enter the user ID message. However, I found that the user needs to click 3 times in order to select all the text (in this case it is Please enter the user ID). Is it possible to select the entire text with only one click?Edit:Sorry, I forgot to say: I must use the input type="text"You can use this javascript snippet:But apparently it doesn\'t work on mobile Safari. In those cases you can use:The previously posted solutions have two quirks:Here\'s a complete solution that selects all text on focus, but allows selecting a specific cursor point after focus.Html (you\'ll have to put the onclick attribute on every input you want it to work for on the page)OR A BETTER OPTION jQuery (this will work for every text input on the page, no need to change your html): I know this is old, but the best option is to now use the new placeholder HTML attribute if possible:This will cause the text to show unless a value is entered, eliminating the need to select text or clear inputs.The answers listed are partial according to me. I have linked below two examples of how to do this in Angular and with JQuery.This solution has the following features:JQuery:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/VZ0o2FJQHTmOMfSPRqpH?p=previewAngular:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/llcyAf?p=previewTry:It works great for me.Indeed, use onclick="this.select();" but remember not to combine it with disabled="disabled" - it will not work then and you will need to manually select or multi-click to select, still. If you wish to lock the content value to be selected, combine with the attribute readonly.You can always use document.execCommand (supported in all major browsers)Selects all text in the currently focused element.Here\'s a reusable version of Shoban\'s answer:That way you can reuse the clear script for multiple elements.input autofocus, with onfocus event:This lets you open a form with the desired element selected. It works by using autofocus to hit the input, which then sends itself an onfocus event, which in turn selects the text.Well this is normal activity for a TextBox.Click 1 - Set focusClick 2/3 (double click) - Select textYou could set focus on the TextBox when the page first loads to reduce the "select" to a single double-click event.The problem with catching the click event is that each subsequent click within the text will select it again, whereas the user was probably expecting to reposition the cursor.What worked for me was declaring a variable, selectSearchTextOnClick, and setting it to true by default. The click handler checks that the variable\'s still true: if it is, it sets it to false and performs the select(). I then have a blur event handler which sets it back to true.Results so far seem like the behavior I\'d expect.(Edit: I neglected to say that I\'d tried catching the focus event as someone suggested,but that doesn\'t work: after the focus event fires, the click event can fire, immediately deselecting the text).This question has options for when .select() is not working on mobile platforms: Programmatically selecting text in an input field on iOS devices (mobile Safari)Use "placeholder" instead of "value" in your input field.Html like this \n<input type="text" value="click the input to select" onclick="javascript:textSelector(this)"/> and javascript code without bindThe exact solution to what you asked is :But I suppose,you are trying to show "Please enter the user ID" as a placeholder or hint in the input.\nSo,you can use the following as a more efficient solution:If you are using AngularJS, you can use a custom directive for easy access:Now one can just use it like this:The sample is with requirejs - so the first and the last line can be skipped if using something else.If anyone want to do this on page load w/ jQuery (sweet for search fields) here is my solutionBased on this post . Thanks to CSS-Tricks.comIf you are just trying to have placeholder text that gets replaced when a user selects the element then it is obviously best practice to use placeholder attribute nowadays.  However, if you want to select all of the current value when a field gains focus then a combination of @Cory House and @Toastrackenigma answers seems to be most canonical.  Use focus and focusout events, with handlers that set/release the current focus element, and select all when focused.  An angular2/typescript example is as follows (but would be trivial to convert to vanilla js):Template:Component:
