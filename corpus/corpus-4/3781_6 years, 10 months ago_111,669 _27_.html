I\'m trying to write a test for the Jasmine Test Framework which expects an error. At the moment I\'m using a Jasmine Node.js integration from GitHub.In my Node module I have the following code:Now I try to write a test which expects this error:I tried also Error() and some other variants and just can\'t figure out how to make it work.you should be passing a function into the expect(...) call. The code you have here:is trying to actually call parser.parse(raw) in an attempt to pass the result into expect(...),Try using an anonymous function instead:You are using:But if you\'ll have a look on the function comment (expected is string):I suppose you should probably write it like this (using lambda - anonymous function):This is confirmed in the following example:Douglas Crockford strongly recommends this approach, instead of using "throw new Error()" (prototyping way):I replace Jasmine\'s toThrow matcher with the following, which lets you match on the exception\'s name property or its message property.  For me this makes tests easier to write and less brittle, as I can do the following:and then test with the following:This lets me tweak the exception message later without breaking tests, when the important thing is that it threw the expected type of exception.This is the replacement for toThrow that allows this:A more elegant solution than creating an anonymous function who\'s sole purpose is to wrap another, is to use es5\'s bind function. The bind function creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.Instead of:expect(function () { parser.parse(raw, config); } ).toThrow("Parsing is not possible");Consider:expect(parser.parse.bind(parser, raw, config)).toThrow("Parsing is not possible");The bind syntax allows you to test functions with different this values, and in my opinion makes the test more readable.
