I wanted to use a custom background for my UITextFields. This works fine except for the fact that I have to use UITextBorderStyleNone to make it look pretty. This forces the text to stick to the left without any padding.Can I set a padding manually so that it looks similar to UITextBorderStyleRoundedRect except for using my custom background image?I found a neat little hack to set the left padding for this exact situation. Basically, you set the leftView property of the UITextField to be an empty view of the size of the padding you want:Worked like a charm for me! I created this category implementation and added it to the top of the .m file. Based off the link Piotr Blasiak provided. It seemed simpler then creating a whole new subclass, and also simpler then adding the additional UIView. Still, it seems like something is missing to not be able to control the padding inside a text field.Swift 2 solution: A Swift 3 version for Xcode >6, where you can edit the inset value in Interface Builder / Storyboard.A good approach to add padding to UITextField is to subclass and add an edgeInsets property.  You then set the edgeInsets and the UITextField will be drawn accordingly.  This will also function correctly with a custom leftView or rightView set.OSTextField.hOSTextField.mIn iOS 6 myTextField.leftView = paddingView; is causing issueThis solves the problemJust subclass UITextField like this:This adds horizontal padding of 10 points either side.Based on Evil Trout\'s answer you might wanna create a category to make it easier to use across multiple applications.Header file:Implementation file:Usage ExampleHope it helps you out guysCheersObjective C Code MyTextField.hMyTextField.mPaddingTextField.swiftSet your textfield class is PaddingTextField and custom your padding as you want\n\nEnjoy itYou can\'t set padding. Instead have a UIView which has your background image and the UITextField inside of it. Set the UITextField width as UIViewWidth-(paddingSize x 2) and the height similarly and then set it at point paddingSize,paddingSize.Swift version:So that you can assign value in IBJust subclass UITextField like this (Swift version):This adds horizontal padding of 25.0 points either side.I was based off Nate\'s solution, but then i found it that this causes problems when you use the leftView/rightView properties, so its better tune the super\'s implementation, because it will take the left/right view\'s into account.Here\'s how to achieve this in SWIFTResourceSwift 2.0 Version:^ these suggestions are great for those who are programmatically creating an interface. But there are two LAZY EASY WAYS for those of us who use the Xcode interface builder:easier: put a UIImageView behind a text fieldeasiest: change the border style on your to the simple black square (second from left option), then add your image as a background image. The image takes precedence over the square, so you still get the padding needed for a normal image background, without the square actually being drawn on.EDIT: you can also use the black sphere (third from left option when selecting the UITextBox in IB), it does not work with the far right, "graphical sphere" style. The best way to do this is simply make a class using subclass of UITextField and in .m fileby doing this go to your storyboard or xib and click on identity inspector and replace UITextfield with your own "CustomTextField" in class option.Note: If you simply give padding with auto layout for textfield then your application will not run and show only blank screen.Swift 3 SolutionUpdated version for Swift 3:Based on @Evil Trout\'s most voted answer I created a custom method in my ViewController class, like shown bellow:Now I can call that method inside (viewDidLoad method) and send any of my TextFields to that method and add padding for both right and left, and give text and background colors by writing just one line of code, as follows:This Worked perfectly on iOS 7!\nI know that adding too much Views might make this a bit heavier class to be loaded. But when concerned about the difficulty in other solutions, I found myself more biased to this method and more flexible with using this way. ;)Thanks for the Hack "Evil Trout"! (bow)I thought I should update this answer\'s code snippet with Swift:Since Swift allow us to write extensions for the existing classes, let\'s write it in that way.Usage:Hope this would be helpful to somebody else out there! \nCheers!@Evil trout\'s answer is great. I have been using this approach for quite a some time now. The only thing it lacks is "dealing with numerous text fields". I tried other approaches but does not seem to work.Subclassing UITextField just to add a padding didn\'t make any sense to me. So, I iterated over all UITextFields to add the padding.Brody\'s solution worked perfect for me. I have had to add side views on a textfield and add additional padding. So by implementing the custom UIEdgeInsets property to a UITextField subclass I have managed to achieve the task. I\'m going to use this new subclass in all of my projects.will add border, which worked as padding for me. Here is a Swift code to give padding in UITextfieldand call usingAnother consideration is that, if you have more than one UITextField where you are adding padding, is to create a separate UIView for each textfield - because they cannot be shared.Why not Attributed String !?!, this is one of the blessing feature of IOS 6.0 :)Nate Flink\'s  answer is my favourite, but don\'t forget about right/left views.\nE.g for UITextField subclass:Above code set right padding for rightView of UITextField.you can use category. set padding to left and rightUITextField+Padding.hUITextField+Padding.myou can set padding like this\n   self.phoneNumTF.paddingValue=10.f;\nor\n    self.phoneNumTF.leftPadding=10.f;The best solution I found so far is a category. That\'s how I add a 5 points padding to left and right:The #pragma\'s are just for removing the annoying warningsI found it far easier to use a non-editable UITextView and set the contentOffset
