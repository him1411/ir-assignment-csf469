I have the code below that hides and shows the navigational bar.  It is hidden when the first view loads and then hidden when the "children" get called.  Trouble is that I cannot find the event/action to trigger it to hide again when they get back to the root view....I have a "test" button on the root page that manually does the action but it is not pretty and I want it to be automatic.The nicest solution I have found is to do the following in the first view controller.Objective-CSwiftThis will cause the navigation bar to animate in from the left (together with the next view) when you push the next UIViewController on the stack, and animate away to the left (together with the old view), when you press the back button on the UINavigationBar.Please note also that these are not delegate methods, you are overriding UIViewController\'s implementation of these methods, and according to the documentation you must call the super\'s implementation somewhere in your implementation.Another approach I found is to set a delegate for the NavigationController and set the NavigationBarHidden value in navigationController:willShowViewController:animated:Easy way to customize the behavior for each ViewController all in one place.I would put the code in the viewWillAppear delegate on each view being shown:Like this where you need to hide it:Like this where you need to show it:One slight tweak I had to make on the other answers is to only unhide the bar in viewWillDisappear if the reason it is disappearing is due to a navigation item being pushed on it. This is because the view can disappear for other reasons.So I only unhide the bar if this view is no longer the topmost view:in Swift 3:The currently accepted answer does not match the intended behavior described in the question. The question asks for the navigation bar to be hidden on the root view controller, but visible everywhere else, but the accepted answer hides the navigation bar on a particular view controller. What happens when another instance of the first view controller is pushed onto the stack? It will hide the navigation bar even though we are not looking at the root view controller.Instead, @Chad M.\'s strategy of using the UINavigationControllerDelegate is a good one, and here is a more complete solution. Steps:Complete code for this solution can be found in this Gist. Here\'s the navigationController:willShowViewController:animated implementation:After multiple trials here is how I got it working for what I wanted. \nThis is what I was trying. \n- I have a view with a image. and I wanted to have the image go full screen. \n- I have a navigation controller with a tabBar too. So i need to hide that too. \n- Also, my main requirement was not just hiding, but having a fading effect too while showing and hiding.This is how I got it working. Step 1 - I have a image and user taps on that image once. I capture that gesture and push it into the new imageViewController, its in the imageViewController, I want to have full screen image.Step 2 - All these steps below are in the ImageViewControllerStep 2.1 - In ViewDidLoad, show the navBarStep 2.2 - In viewDidAppear, set up a timer task with delay ( I have it set for 1 sec delay). And after the delay, add fading effect. I am using alpha to use fading.step 2.3 - Under viewWillAppear, add singleTap gesture to the image and make the navBar translucent. Step 3 - Finally in viewWillDisappear, make sure to put all the stuff back In case anyone still having trouble with the fast backswipe cancelled bug as @fabb commented in the accepted answer.I manage to fix this by overriding viewDidLayoutSubviews, in addition to viewWillAppear/viewWillDisappear as shown below:In my case, I notice that it is because the root view controller (where nav is hidden) and the pushed view controller (nav is shown) has different status bar styles (e.g. dark and light). The moment you start the backswipe to pop the view controller, there will be additional status bar colour animation. If you release your finger in order to cancel the interactive pop, while the status bar animation is not finished, the navigation bar is forever gone!However, this bug doesn\'t occur if status bar styles of both view controllers are the same.If what you want is to hide the navigation bar completely in the controller, a much cleaner solution is to, in the root controller, have something like:When you push a child view in the controller, the Navigation Bar will remain hidden; if you want to display it just in the child, you\'ll add the code for displaying it(self.navigationController.navigationBarHidden=NO;) in the viewWillAppear callback, and similarly the code for hiding it on viewWillDisappearThe simplest implementation may be to just have each view controller specify whether its navigation bar is hidden or not in its viewWillAppear:animated: method. The same approach works well for hiding/showing the toolbar as well:By implement this code in your ViewController you can get this effect\n Actually the trick is , hide the navigationBar when that Controller is launched and unhide the navigation bar when user leave that page  do this is viewWillDisappear Simple Swift 3 compatible answer:\nUse a segue and present it modally. It is in line with Apple Documentation.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewControllerCatalog/Chapters/NavigationControllers.htmlExample:\nLogin Page Controller -> Navigation Controller -> Create New Account Controller (With Back Button that links back to the Login Page via segue that presents modally)When linking back to another page that you do not want the Navigation bar to appear on, create a segue to that page, in the example, attach it to the back button and drag it to the Login Page, but select Present Modally. \nThis can all be done from the Main.storyboard.No coding needed! Hiding navigation bar only on first page can be achieved through storyboard as well. On storyboard, goto Navigation Controller Scene->Navigation Bar. And select \'Hidden\' property from the Attributes inspector. This will hide navigation bar starting from first viewcontroller until its made visible for the required viewcontroller. Navigation bar can be set back to visible in  ViewController\'s ViewWillAppear callback.when you swipe fast from left edge and release ,your navigationBar will disappear,and you can never go back.I found a strange solution that if you set the status bar style UIStatusBarStyleLightContent to every viewControllers of your navigationController,the navigation bar will work well as expected.
