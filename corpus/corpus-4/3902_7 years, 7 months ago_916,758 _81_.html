I have a simple jquery click eventand a jquery reference defined in the site.masterI have checked that the script is being resolved correctly, i\'m able to see the markup and view the script directly in firebug, so i must be being found. However i am still getting:$ is not definedand non of the jquery works. I\'ve also tried the various variations of this like $(document).ready and jQuery etc.It\'s an MVC 2 app on .net 3.5, i\'m sure i\'m being really dense, everywhere on google says check the file is reference correctly, which i have checked and checked again, please advise! :/That error can only be caused by one of three things:You should check the Firebug net panel to see if the file is actually being loaded properly.  If not, it will be highlighted red and will say "404" beside it.  If the file is loading properly, that means that the issue is number 2.Make sure all jQuery javascript code is being run inside a code block such as:This will ensure that your code is being loaded after jQuery has been initialized.One final thing to check is to make sure that you are not loading any plugins before you load jQuery.  Plugins extend the "$" object, so if you load a plugin before loading jQuery core, then you\'ll get the error you described.Note: If you\'re loading code which does not require jQuery to run it does not need to be placed inside the jQuery ready handler. That code may be separated using document.readyState.It could be that you have your script tag called before the jquery script is called.This results as $ is not definedPut the jquery.js before your script tag  and it will work ;) like so:First you need to make sure that jQuery script is loaded. This could be from a CDN or local on your website.  If you don\'t load this first before trying to use jQuery it will tell you that jQuery is not defined. This could be in the HEAD or in the footer of the page, just make sure you load it before you try to call any other jQuery stuff. Then you need to use one of the two solutions beloworplease be aware that many times $(document).ready(function(){//code here}); will not work, especially true in wordpress.If the jQuery plugin call is next to the </body>, and your script is loaded before that, you should make your code run after window.onload event, like this:`so, your code will run only after the window load, when all assets have been loaded. In that point, the jQuery ($) will be defined.If you use that:`the $ isn\'t yet defined at this time, because it is called before the jQuery is loaded, and your script will fail on that first line on console.I just did the same thing and found i had a whole lot of So they were loading, but no further hint as to why it wasn\'t working. Needless to say, proper spelling fixed it.Use a scripts section in the view and master layout.Put all your scripts defined in your view inside a Scripts section of the view. This way you can have the master layout load this after all other scripts have been loaded. This is the default setup when starting a new MVC5 web project. Not sure about earlier versions.Views/Foo/MyView.cshtml:Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtmlNote how the scripts section is rendered last in the master layout file.Are you using any other JavaScript libraries? If so, you will probably need to use jQuery in compatibility mode:http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Librariesmake sure you really load jquery\nthis is not jquery - it\'s the ui!This is a correct script source for jquery:As stated above, it happens due to the conflict of $ variable.I resolved this issue by reserving a secondary variable for jQuery with no conflict.and then use it anywheremore details can be found here I got the same error message when I misspelled the jQuery reference and instead of type="text/javascript" I typed "...javascirpt". ;)It sounds like jQuery isn\'t loading properly. Which source/version are you using?Alternatively, it could a be namespace collision, so try using jQuery explicitly instead of using $. If that works, you may like to use noConflict to ensure the other code that\'s using $ doesn\'t break.after some tests i found a fast solution ,\nyou can add in top of your index page:it work very fine :)I use Url.Content and never have a problem.In the solution it is mentioned - \n"One final thing to check is to make sure that you are not loading any plugins before you load jQuery. Plugins extend the "$" object, so if you load a plugin before loading jQuery core, then you\'ll get the error you described."For avoiding this - Many JavaScript libraries use $ as a function or variable name, just as jQuery does. In jQuery\'s case, $ is just an alias for jQuery, so all functionality is available without using $. If we need to use another JavaScript library alongside jQuery, we can return control of $ back to the other library with a call to $.noConflict():I had the same problem and it was because my reference to the jQuery.js was not in the  tag.  Once I switched that, everything started working.AnthonyIt means that your jQuery library has not been loaded yet.You can move your code after pulling jQuery library.or you can use something like thisI had this problem once for no apparent reason. It was happenning locally whilst I was running through the aspnet development server. It had been working and I reverted everything to a state where it had previously been working and still it didn\'t work. I looked in the chrome debugger and the jquery-1.7.1.min.js had loaded without any problems. It was all very confusing. I still don\'t know what the problem was but closing the browser, closing the development server and then trying again sorted it out.Just place  jquery url on the top of your jquery codelike this--Turns out my problem was a rather stupid one - I had put <script href=""> instead of <script src="">We have the same problem....but accidentally i checked folder properties and set something...You have to check the properties of each folders that you\'re accessing..I hope that this is the solution......When using jQuery in asp.net, if you are using a master page and you are loading the jquery source file there, make sure you have the header contentplaceholder after all the jquery script references. I had a problem where any pages that used that master page would return \'$ is not defined\' simply because the incorrect order was making the client side code run before the jquery object was created. So make sure you have:That way the code will run in order and you will be able to run jQuery code on the child pages.In my case I was pointing to Google hosted JQuery.  It was included properly, but I was on an HTTPS page and calling it via HTTP.  Once I fixed the problem (or allowed insecure content), it fired right up.After tried everything here with no result, I solved the problem simply by moving the script src tag from body to headYou just put the jQuery library in the head section of the html :)I was having this same problem and couldn\'t figure out what was causing it. I recently converted my HTML files from Japanese to UTF-8, but I didn\'t do anything with the script files. Somehow jquery-1.10.2.min.js became corrupted in this process (I still have no idea how). Replacing jquery-1.10.2.min.js with the original fixed it.it appears that if you locate your jquery.js files under the same folder or in some subfolders where your html file is, the Firebug problem is solved. eg if your html is under C:/folder1/, then your js files should be somewhere under C:/folder1/ (or C:/folder1/folder2 etc) as well and addressed accordingly in the html doc. hope this helps.This worked for me (MVC5 project):u just add at starting of your page and check your src link in a any browser address bar, if you are getting some code then this will work for you.\nasifI have the same issue and no case resolve me the problem. The only thing that works for me, it\'s put on the  of the Site.master file, the next:With src="<%= ResolveUrl("")... the load of jQuery in the Content Pages is correct.Check the exact path of your jquery file is included.<script src="assets/plugins/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script> if you add this on bottom of your page , please all call JS function below this declaration.Check using this code test ,Peace!
