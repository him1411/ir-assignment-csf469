I\'m learning new commands in VIM all the time, but I\'m sure everyone learns something new once in a while. I just recently learned about this:zz, zt, zb - position cursor at middle, top, or bottom of screenWhat are some other useful or elegant commands you wish you\'d learned ages ago?I really wish I\'d known that you can use Ctrl-C instead of ESC to switch out of insert mode. That\'s been a real productivity boost for me.The most recent "wow" trick that I learnt is a method of doing complicated search-and-replace.  Quite often in the past, I\'ve had a really complicated regexp to do substitutions on and it\'s not worked.  There is a better way:The "trick" here (for want of a better word) is the way that you can use the search to create the regexp (and \'incsearch\' highlights it as you enter characters) and then use an empty pattern in the substitution: the empty pattern defaults to the last search pattern.Example:Equivalent to:See:I created this reference of my most used command for a friend of mine. Hope people will find something useful:gi switches to insertion mode placing the cursor at the same location it was previously.I wish i knew that before I started vi for the first time^X-F completes using filenames from the current directory. No more copying/pasting from the terminal or painful double checking.^X-P completes using words in the current file:set scrollbind forces one buffer to scroll alongside another. e.g. split your window into two vertical panes. Load one file in each (perhaps different versions of the same file). Do :set scrollbind in each. Now when you scroll in one, both panes will scroll together. Ideal for comparing files.You can use a whole set of commands to change text inside brackets / parentheses / quotation marks/ tags. It\'s super useful to avoid having to find the start and finish of the group. Try ci(, ci{, ci<, ci", ci\', ct depending on what kind of object you want to change. And the ca(, ca{, ... variants delete the brackets / quotation marks as well.Easy to remember: change inside a bracketed statement / change a bracketed statement.Don\'t press escape ever. See this answer to learn why. As mentioned above, ctrl-c is a better alternative. I strongly suggest mapping your caps lock key to escape.If you\'re editing a ctags compatible language, using a tags file and :ta, ctrl-], etc is a great way to navigate the code, even across multiple files. Also, ctrl-n and ctrl-p completion using the tags file is a great way to cut down on keystrokes.If you\'re editing a line that is wrapped because it\'s wider than your buffer, you can move up/down using gk and gj.Try to focus on effective use of the motion commands before you learn bad habits. Things like using \'dt\' or \'d3w\' instead of pressing x a bunch of times. Basically any time that you find yourself presing the same key repeatedly, there\'s probably a better/faster/more concise way of accomplishing the same thing.The asterisk key * will search for the word under the cursor.[+Tab will take you to the definition of a C function that\'s under your cursor. (doesn\'t always work though.)ZZ (works like :wq)About cursor position. I found that cursor which always stays in the middle of screen is coolSome of my latest additions to my VIm brainstore::shell to launch a shell console from Vim. Useful when for example you want to test a script without quitting Vim. Simply hit ^d when you done with the shell console, and then you come back to Vim and your edited file. gv starts Visual mode and automatically selects what you previously had selected.Not much, really.  You need a Makefile in the current directory.While you\'re in vim, type :make to invoke a shell, build your program.  Don\'t worry when the output scrolls by; just press [Enter] when it\'s finished to return to vim.Back within vim, you have the following commands at your disposal:There are more; if you\'re interested, type :help :cc from within vim.vimcryptionvim -x filename.txtYou will be asked for a passphrase, edit and save. Now whenever you open the file in vi again you will have to enter the password to view.^P and ^NComplete previous (^P) or next (^N) text. ^O and ^IGo to previous (^O - "O" for old) location or to the next (^I - "I" just near to "O").\nWhen you perform searches, edit files etc., you can navigate through these "jumps" forward and back.marksPress ma (m- mark, a - name of mark). Later to return to the position type `athis always cheers me up^r^w to paste the word under cursor in the command mode.\nReally useful when using grep or replace commandsPress % when the cursor is on a quote, paren, bracket, or brace to find its match.Until [character] (t). Useful for any command which accepts a range. My favorite is ct; or ct) which deletes everything up to the trailing semicolon / closing parentheses and then places you in insert mode.Also, G and gg are useful (Go to bottom and top respectively).q<letter> - records a macro.and @<same-letter> - plays it back.These are by far the most useful commands in vim since you can have the computer do a whole lot of work for you, and you don\'t even have to write a program or anything.Typing a line number followed by gg will take you to that line.I wish I\'d known basic visual block  mode stuff earlier.  Even if you don\'t use VIM for anything else, it can be a big time saver to open up a file in VIM just for some block operations.  I\'m quite sure I wasted a ton of time doing this kind of thing manually.Examples I\'ve found particularly useful, when, say, refactoring lists of symbolic constant names consistently:Enter Visual Block mode (Ctrl-Q for me on Windows instead of Ctrl-V)Move cursor to highlight the desired block.Then, I whatever text and press Esc to have the text inserted in front of the block on every line.Use A instead of I to have the text inserted after the block on every line.Also - simply toggling the case of a visual selection with ~ can be a big time saver.And simply deleting columns, too, with d of course.^y will copy the character above the cursor.qx will start recording keystrokes. You can do pretty much any editing task and Vim remembers it. Hit q again when you\'re finished, and press @x to replay your keystrokes. This is great for repetitive edits which are too complex to write a mapping for. You can have many recordings by using a character other than x.I would have to say that one of my favorites is putting the help window in a new tab:This opens up help in a new tab and, as somebody that loves vim tabs, this is ridiculously useful.Opening multiple files using tabs:navigating between open filesSave the open session so that you can get back to your list of open files later:Open a created sessionclose all files at once EDIT:Another command I learned recently:It allows you to run a command on an event so you could for example run the command make when you save a file using something like::b [any portion of a buffer name] to switch buffers. So if you have two buffers "somefile1.txt", and "someotherfile2.txt", you can switch to the second with simply ":b 2.t<enter>". It also supports tab completion, although it\'s not required.Speaking of tab completion, the setting :set wildmode=full wildmenu is also very helpful. It enables complete tab completion for command-mode, as well as a very helpful ncurses-style menu of all the possible matches when using it.cwChange word - deletes the word under the cursor and puts you in insert mode to type a new one.  Of course this works with other movement keys, so you can do things like c$ to change to the end of the line.f + characterFinds the next occurrence of the character on the current line.  So you can do vft to select all the text up to the next "t" on the current line.  It\'s another movement key, so it works with other commands too.Tabbed interface\nApart from split windows, you also can have tabbed windows. In the escape mode, type :tabnew. You can open multiple tabs like this. To navigate between tabs, type tabn. This will move to the next tab. To move to a tabbed window, type :tabn2 to move the second tab and so on.To close a tab, type :tabc or :tabclose or just :close.If you are in a terminal emulator (basically terminal in GUI) then you can try doing :set mouse=a. Once that\'s done, you can click inside the editor with your mouse. And this will also help you navigate between  tabs by clicking, and also closing by clicking on the close button at the right side.Align your code - Full file\nJust type G=gg in the escape mode.Fold your code\nSay you have a function that is completed. You want to minimise (or fold) that part of code so that you can free up some space and reduce clutter. Just select the code. Then, type :fold.This will fold the code up. If you want to expand the code, just go there and type zo. To fold again, type zc.
