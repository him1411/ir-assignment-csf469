To search forward in vim for cake, I\'d type /cake, but the cursor jumps to the first match when I press return. Is there a vim command analogous to "find next"?It is n for next and N for previous.And if you use reverse search with ? (e.g ?cake) instead of /, it is the other way round.If it is installed on your system, you should try to run vimtutor command from your terminal, which will start a tutorial of the basic Vim commands.Rob Wells advice about * and # is also very pertinent.The most useful shortcut in vim, IMHO, is the * key.Put the cursor on a word and hit the * key and you will jump to the next instance of that word.The # key does the same but jumps to the previous instance of the word.Truly a time saver.When I was beginning I needed to watch a demoAre you looking for the n key?Typing n will go to the next match.As discussed, there are several ways to search:plus, navigating prev/next with N and n.You can also edit/recall your search history by pulling up the search prompt with / and then cycle with C-p/C-n. Even more useful is q/, which takes you to a window where you can navigate the search history.Also for consideration is the all-important \'hlsearch\' (type :hls to enable). This makes it much easier to find multiple instances of your pattern. You might even want make your matches extra bright with something like:But then you might go crazy with constant yellow matches all over your screen. So you\xe2\x80\x99ll often find yourself using :noh. This is so common that a mapping is in order:I easily remember this one as z since I used to constantly type /zz<CR> (which is a fast-to-type uncommon occurrence) to clear my highlighting. But the :noh mapping is way better.
