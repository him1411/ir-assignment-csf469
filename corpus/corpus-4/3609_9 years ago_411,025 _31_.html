I\'m writing a LINQ to SQL statement, and I\'m after the standard syntax for a normal inner join with an ON clause in C#.How do you represent the following in LINQ to SQL:It goes something like:It would be nice to have sensible names and fields for your tables for a better example. :)UpdateI think for your query this might be more appropriate:Since you are looking for the contacts, not the dealers.And because I prefer the expression chain syntax, here is how you do it with that:Use Linq Join operator:To extend the expression chain syntax answer by Clever Human:If you wanted to do things (like filter or select) on fields from both tables being joined together -- instead on just one of those two tables -- you could create a new object in the lambda expression of the final parameter to the Join method incorporating both of those tables, for example:The interesting part is the lambda expression in line 4 of that example: ...where we construct a new anonymous-type object which has as properties the DealerContact and Dealer records, along with all of their fields.  We can then use fields from those records as we filter and select the results, as demonstrated by the remainder of the example, which uses dc_d as a name for the anonymous object we built which has both the DealerContact and Dealer records as its properties.basically LINQ join operator provides no benefit for SQL. I.e. the following querywill result in INNER JOIN in SQLjoin is useful for IEnumerable<> because it is more efficient: clause would be re-executed for every dealer\nBut for IQueryable<> it is not the case. Also join is less flexible.You create a foreign key, and LINQ-to-SQL creates navigation properties for you. Each Dealer will then have a collection of DealerContacts which you can select, filter, and manipulate.orIf you\'re not using navigation properties, you\'re missing out one of the main benefits on LINQ-to-SQL - the part that maps the object graph.Actually, often it is better not to join, in linq that is. When there are navigation properties a very succinct way to write your linq statement is:It translates to a where clause:Use LINQ joins to perform Inner Join.Try this :Where student and course tables have primary key and foreign key relationshiptry instead this,Inner Join Two tables in Linq C#var result = from q1 in table1\n               join q2 in table2\n               on q1.Customer_Id equals q2.Customer_Id\n               select new { q1.Name, q1.Mobile, q2.Purchase, q2.Dates }One Best exampleTable Names :  TBL_Emp and TBL_Dep
