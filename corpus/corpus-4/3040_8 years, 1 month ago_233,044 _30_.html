I have a data frame containing a factor.  When I create a subset of this data frame using subset() or another indexing function, a new data frame is created.  However, the factor variable retains all of its original levels -- even when they do not exist in the new data frame.This creates headaches when doing faceted plotting or using functions that rely on factor levels.What is the most succinct way to remove levels from a factor in my new data frame?Here\'s my example:All you should have to do is to apply factor() to your variable again after subsetting:EDITFrom the factor page example:For dropping levels from all factor columns in a dataframe, you can use:Since R version 2.12, there\'s a droplevels() function.It is a known issue, and one possible remedy is provided by drop.levels() in the gdata package where your example becomesThere is also the dropUnusedLevels function in the Hmisc package. However, it only works by altering the subset operator [ and is not applicable here.As a corollary, a direct approach on a per-column basis is a simple as.factor(as.character(data)):If you don\'t want this behaviour, don\'t use factors, use character vectors instead.  I think this makes more sense than patching things up afterwards. Try the following before loading your data with read.table or read.csv:  The disadvantage is that you\'re restricted to alphabetical ordering.  (reorder is your friend for plots)Here\'s another way, which I believe is equivalent to the factor(..) approach:Another way of doing the same but with dplyrEdit: Also Works ! Thanks to agenisThis is obnoxious.  This is how I usually do it, to avoid loading other packages:which gets you:Note that the new levels will replace whatever occupies their index in the old levels(subdf$letters), so something like:won\'t work.This is obviously not ideal when you have lots of levels, but for a few, it\'s quick and easy.here is a way of doing thatLooking at the droplevels methods code in the R source you can see it wraps to factor function. That means you can basically recreate the column with factor function.\nBelow the data.table way to drop levels from all the factor columns.  I wrote utility functions to do this.  Now that I know about gdata\'s drop.levels, it looks pretty similar.  Here they are (from here):Very interesting thread, I especially liked idea to just factor subselection again. I had the similar problem before and I just converted to character and then back to factor.For the sake of completeness, now there is also fct_drop in the forcats package http://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_drop.html.It differs from droplevels in the way it deals with NA:
