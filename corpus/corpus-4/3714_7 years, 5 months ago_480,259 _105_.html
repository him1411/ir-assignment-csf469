I\'m on Mac Snow Leopard and I just installed git.I just tried git clone git@thechaw.com:cakebook.git but that gives me this error.  What am I missing?\nI\'ve also tried doing ssh-keygen with no passphase but still same error.This info is working on theChaw but can be applied to all other git repositories which support SSH pubkey authentications. (See gitolite, gitlab or github for example.)First start by setting up your own public/private key pair set. This\n  can use either DSA or RSA, so basically any key you setup will work.\n  On most systems you can use ssh-keygen.cd ~/.ssh && ssh-keygenThats it you should be good to clone and checkout.Further information can be found on https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys (thanks to @Lee Whitney)More extensive troubleshooting and even  automated fixing can be done with: Source: http://help.github.com/ssh-issues/This error can happen when you are accessing the SSH URL (Read/Write) instead of Git Read-Only URL but you have no write access to that repo.Sometimes you just want to clone your own repo, e.g. deploy to a server. In this case you actually only need READ-ONLY access. But since that\'s your own repo, GitHub may display SSH URL if that\'s your preference. In this situation, if your remote host\'s public key is not in your GitHub SSH Keys, your access will be denied, which is expected to happen.An equivalent case is when you try cloning someone else\'s repo to which you have no write access with SSH URL.In a word, if your intent is to clone-only a repo, use HTTPS URL (https://github.com/{user_name}/{project_name}.git) instead of SSH URL (git@github.com:{user_name}/{project_name}.git), which avoids (unnecessary) public key validation.Update: GitHub is displaying HTTPS as the default protocol now and this move can probably reduce possible misuse of SSH URLs.The github help link helped me sort out this problem. Looks like the ssh key was not added to the ssh-agent. This is what i ended up doing. Command 1:Ensure ssh-agent is enabled. The command starts the ssh-agent in the background:Command 2:Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent:Note that (at least for some projects) you must have a github account with an ssh key.Look at the keys listed in your authentication agent (ssh-add -l)\n  (if you don\'t see any, add one of your existing keys with ssh-add /path/to/your/key (eg: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa))\n  (if you don\'t have any keys, first create one. See: http://rcsg-gsir.imsb-dsgi.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/documents/internet/node31.html or just google ssh-keygen)To verify that you have a key associated with your github account:Go to: https://github.com/settings/sshYou should see at least one key with a hash key matching one of the hashes you saw when you typed ssh-add -l just a minute ago.If you don\'t, add one, then try again.I had a slight different situation, I was logged on to a remote server and was using git on the server, when I ran any git command I got the same messageThe way I fixed it was by changing the file /etc/ssh_config on my Mac. \nfromto This works for me:On Windows, make sure all your apps agree on HOME.  Msys will surprisingly NOT do it for you. I had to set an environment variable because ssh and git couldn\'t seem to agree on where my .ssh directory was.The basic GIT instructions did not make a reference to the SSH key stuff. Following some of the links above, I found a git help page that explains, step-by-step, exactly how to do this for various operating systems (the link will detect your OS and redirect, accordingly):http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect/It walks through everything needed for GITHub and also gives detailed explanations such as "why add a passphrase when creating an RSA key." I figured I\'d post it, in case it helps someone else...One of the easiest way go to terminal-Are you in a corporate environment?  Is it possible that your system variables have recently changed?  Per this SO answer, ssh keys live at %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub.  So if %HOMEDRIVE% recently changed, git doesn\'t know where to look for your key, and thus all of the authentication stuff.  Try running ssh -vT git@github.com.  Take note of where the identity file is located.  For me, that was pointing not to my normal \\Users\\MyLogin but rather to a network drive, because of a change to environment variables pushed at the network level.The solution?  Since my new %HOMEDRIVE% has the same permissions as my local files, I just moved my .ssh folder there, and called it a day.In addition to Rufinus\' reply, the shortcut to copy your ssh key to the clipboard in Windows is:Refs:I have just experienced this issue while setting my current project, and none of the above solution works. so i tried looking what\'s really happening on the debug list using the command ssh -vT git@github.com. I notice that my private key filename is not on the list. so renaming the private key filename to \'id_rsa\' do the job. hope this could help.Guys this is how it worked for me:1- Open terminal and go to user [See attached image]2- Open .ssh folder and make sure it doesn\'t have any file like id_rsa or id_rsa.pub otherwise sometimes it wont properly rewrite files3 - git --version [Check for git installation and version]4- git config --global user.email "your email id"5- git config --global user.name "your name"6- git config --list [make sure you have set your name & email]7- cd ~/.ssh8- ssh-keygen, it prompts for saving file, allow it9- cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  [Access your public key & copy the key to gerrit settings]Note: You should not be using the sudo command with Git. If you have a very good reason you must use sudo, then ensure you are using it with every command (it\'s probably just better to use su to get a shell as root at that point). If you generate SSH keys without sudo and then try to use a command like sudo git push, you won\'t be using the same keys that you generatedIf you have more than one key you may need to do \nssh-add private-keyfileIts pretty straight forward. Type the below command Generate the SSH key. Open the file and copy the contents. Go to GitHub setting page , and click on SSH key . Click on Add new SSH key, and paste the contents here. That\'s it :) You shouldn\'t see the issue again.I met the same issue because of i was thought the difference between SSH and HTTPS is https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.gitssh://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.gitSo i changed from HTTPS to SSH just by changing https:// to ssh:// nothing on the end of the url was changed.But the truth is:Which means i changed ssh://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git to git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git it works.Stupid error but hope helps someone!I was getting a similar Permission denied (publickey) error when trying to run a makefile.As an alternative to the SSH steps above, you can Install the native GitHub for Mac application.Click Download GitHub for Mac from - https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-macOnce you complete setup with your git hub account (I also installed the git hub command line tools but unsure if this step is required or not) then I received an email -[GitHub] A new public key was added to your accountand my error was fixed.I was getting the same error. My problem was mixing in sudo.  I couldn\'t create the directory I was cloning into automatically without prefixing the git clone command with sudo.  When I did that, however, my ssh keys where not being properly referenced.  To fix it, I set permissions via chmod on the parent directory I wanted to contain my clone so I could write to it.  Then I ran git clone WITHOUT a sudo prefix.  It then worked!  I changed the permissions back after that. Done.I was getting this error because I generated the ssh keys with the wrong email. I was able to connect using ssh, but not using git. The solution was to regenerate the keys using the main email address of my github account.It worked for me.Your public key is saved to the id_rsa.pub;file and is the key you upload to your account. You can save this key to the clipboard by running this:pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pubIt worked for meI was struggling with same problem that\'s what i did and i was able clone the repo. I followed these procedure for iMac.First Step : Checking if we already have the public SSH key.Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key.Default public are one of the following d_dsa.pub,id_ecdsa.pub,id_ed25519.pub,id_rsa.pubIf you don\'t find then go to step 2 otherwise follow step 3Step 2 : Generating public SSH keyThis will generate id_rsa.pub Step 3: Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agentNow copy the SSH key and also add it to you github account In my case, I have reinstalled ubuntu and the user name is changed from previous. In this case the the generated ssh key also differs from the previous one.The issue solved by just copy the current ssh public key, in the repository. The key will be available in your user\'s /home/.ssh/id_rsa.pubThe easiest solution to this, when you are trying to push to a repository with a different username is:I was able to get over this issue by following below steps in my ubuntu system. As i was experimenting with passwordless ssh to the system.sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config1) Commented below : \n   #Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords\n   #PasswordAuthentication yes\n    PasswordAuthentication no ----> commented this. 2) Then restarted the sshd daemon as below.service sshd restartSteps for Mac:This strange error, in my case was a symptom of gnome-keyring-daemon incorrectly naming the key to which it required a password.I follow the steps outlined here, and entered the password via the terminal. The error, aka the confounding GUI interface, was resolved.\nSee: https://askubuntu.com/questions/3045/how-to-disable-gnome-keyringYea seriously if you using git just follow the documentation. Theres a hell of alot of Documentation written on this. You cant go wrong if you follow it.\nJust start over if you have to. Link :\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/In my MAC I solved this with:For some reason my git stopped to find the private key in the github_rsa file. This happened in a specific repo. I mean that in other repositories git kept working normally.I think it\'s a bug.I could find this behavior running ssh -vT git@github.com
