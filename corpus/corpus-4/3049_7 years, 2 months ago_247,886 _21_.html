How do I copy / clone / duplicate the data, structure and indexes of a MySQL table to a new one?This is what I\'ve found so far.This will copy the data and the structure, but not the indexes:This will copy the structure and indexes, but not the data:To copy with indexes and triggers do these 2 queries:To copy just structure and data use this one:I\'ve asked this before:Copy a MySQL table including indexesApart from the solution above, you can use AS to make it in one line.I found the same situation and the approach which I took was as follows:\n 1. Execute SHOW CREATE TABLE  : This will give you the Create Table syntax for the table which you want to clone\n 2. Run the CREATE TABLE query by changing the table name to clone the table.This will create exact replica of the table which you want to clone along with Indexes. The only thing which you then need is to rename the indexes (if required).MySQL WayAfter tried the solution above. I come up with my own way.My solution a little manually and need DBMS.First export the data.second open the export data.third replace old table name with new table name.fourth change all the trigger name in the data (I use mysql and it show error when I don\'t change trigger name)fifth import your edited sql data to the database. Use MyDatabase:This SQL is used for copying tables, here the contents of oldCustomersTable will be copied to newCustomersTable.\nMake sure the newCustomersTable does not exist in the database.
