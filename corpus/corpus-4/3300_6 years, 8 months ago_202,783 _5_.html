I feel silly for not being able to figure this out, but how do I turn off wordwrap? the css word-wrap property can be forced on with break-word, but cannot be forced off (only can be left alone with normal value).How do I force word wrap off?You need to use the CSS white-space attribute.In particular, white-space: nowrap and white-space: pre are the most commonly used values. The first one seems to be what you \'re after.Added webkit specific values missing from above
