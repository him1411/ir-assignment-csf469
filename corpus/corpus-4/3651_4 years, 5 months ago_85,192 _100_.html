My Tools:Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate + Update 1ReSharper v7.1.25.234My Solution Build Status: Build SuccessfullyBut when I install ReSharper and ReSharper code analysis is enable, many keywords of my code are red with this error:"can not resolve symbol XXX"Another picture of my project >>The ReSharper \xe2\x80\x9cCAN NOT RESOLVE SYMBOL\xe2\x80\x9d errors are everywhere, but my project build process is successfully, and it works correctly.Additional Note: If I disable ReSharper Code Analysis, my project will be Normal, but I want to use ReSharper code analysis.I tried ReSharper \xe2\x86\x92 Options \xe2\x86\x92 General \xe2\x86\x92 Clear Cache. But I still have this problem!One month ago, I got these errors when I uninstalled Visual Studio 2012 RC and installed VS 2012 RTM.I\'ve already uninstalled and installed ReSharper again. But I have this problem yet!My solution has five projects >> two loaded projects (main project + resource project) and three unloaded projectsI realize that my Visual Studio also has bigger problems (More information on Stack Overflow)I can\'t add any reference to my projects (even inside new solutions and new projects)I can\'t install any package (by "Packet Manager Console" or Manage NuGet Package)I can\'t update any package (by "Packet Manager Console" or Manage NuGet Package)I\'ve done a lot of suggestions (of myself and others)Re-resister some DLL filesUsing some windows and registry repair toolsRemove ReSharperRepair Visual Studioand...But I could not solve it.I\'m thinking of installing a new Windows :(What is wrong, and how can I fix it?Try Visual Studio \xe2\x86\x92 menu Tools \xe2\x86\x92 Options \xe2\x86\x92 ReSharper, Suspend button and Resume again (no need to close the window). This works in my case.This worked for me (VS2012u4, R# 7.1.3):This happens in ReSharper when you have two different versions of the same library in your solution. For example project A references automapper version 1.1 and project B references automapper version 1.0.Visual Studio will often compile and run as expected in the situation as it chooses one of the DLLs to bind to. However ReSharper gets massively confused. For me this should be a ReSharper error that it asks you to resolve rather than just going bonkers.UPDATE:I ran into this two days ago (a day after I made this post) by total coincidence and came across this link where they say that it is caused by a bug in the VS API. I tried everything that they recommended and was unable to resolve it even temporarily: I had Autofac 2.6.x that I\'d downloaded from google.code and then swapped it over for the NuGet package version and it willfully refused to see the new reference no matter what I did. They suggest installing the R# 8 EAP but for me it was less hassle to just downgrade to the old version of Autofac.Not much in the way of help, but maybe useful.Clear Resharper cache: Resharper -> Options -> General -> Clear Caches, close and reopen the solution. It worked in R# 9.0 Update 1I had similar problems and cleared the caches found at: AppData\\Local\\JetBrains\\ReSharper\\v7.1\\SolutionCachesSolved the problems for meRunning VS2012 u3I was just having the same issue with ReSharper 8.2 in Visual Studio 2013, and none of the usual solutions here of clearing caches, suspending ReSharper or re-installing ReSharper was working.In my case I ended up solving it as follows... I looked at one of the symbols that it couldn\'t resolve and noted it was in System.Web.Http.dll.  I then found that this was in the Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core NuGet package.  I used the package manager console to try and uninstall that package, except of course it told me that it couldn\'t due to other dependencies.So I uninstalled each dependency up to and including Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core, and then re-installed each package again in the reverse order.  ReSharper picked everything up correctly as it was installed, and now seems fine.This was happening to me with Visual Studio 2015 and ReSharper Ultimate 10.0.2.  I tried pretty much all the solutions above (apart from any reinstallations) and nothing worked.I got it working again with a variety of the above steps in a very specific order:Hopefully after the last step you can breathe a sigh of relief that you don\'t have to reinstall anything, I certainly did!I had the same issue and unloading and reloading problematic project helped me to clear out this issue for ReSharper. Hope this helps.Above links of clearing the cache and/or suspending the ReSharper did not work for me. I just \'refreshed\' the project, which was showing this problem, from the solution explorer and the problem goes away. Sadly, it keeps on recurring and only option it to keep on refreshing every time this problem recurs.I have VS2012 with ReSharper 8.1 on Windows 8I ended up needing to request Resharper to clear its cache along with doing it manually through Windows File Explorer.  This finally resolved the issue for me.For me for VS2015, I had to update Resharper to version 2016.2.2 to resolve the issue. I had already tried (of which none worked for me):I hope that may help someone.I\'m using 7.1, and this worked for me: I my case, I tried all the suggestions above.\nBut, at some point I realized that the problem persists even if Resharper is suspended.\nSo, I looked for similar problem in VS itself and found the solution in the comments for the accepted answer in this SO post.I\'m listing my steps for brevity.I did everything above with no fix.Then I did a step from another SO Q/A (don\'t remember which one) which was to set System.Web.Mvc to Copy Local true. Recompile my project and the errors went away. When I set this assembly back to Copy Local false, the errors didn\'t return.I am using VS2015, R#10. None of the suggested solution worked for me. I deleted the contents of the bin folder of my solution and rebuild the entire solution, that seems to have resolved the issue. Before deleting the contents of the bin folder, I had tried suspending and resuming R#, doing clear cache from R# -> option -> general setting, and also manually deleting the contents from \\AppData\\Local\\JetBrains\\Transient\\ReSharperPlatformVs12\\v01\\SolutionCaches.. Hope it helps someone. For me, I think my solution just got caught in a weird state when I was changing which branch of my local Git repo I was on. Simply switching to the previous branch I was on before the problem started, telling VS to reload all the files, then switching back to the desired branch and reloading again fixed it.We saw this problem as well, specific to files which were shared by multiple projects. There is a combo box in the upper left corner of the editor window that lets you switch project context for the file (and hence the references that impact symbol resolution).Resharper makes it easy to accidentally open the wrong "version" of a shared file by its "go to file or symbol" commands.  Switching context back to the project I use in the solution was all I needed to do to fix this issue.I also saw similar problems reported in ReSharper which did not lead to compile/runtime errors.These were mostly seen when using "{x:Type ...}" or "{x:Static ...}" markup, causing ReSharper to report "Cannot resolve symbol \'Type\'" or "Cannot resolve symbol \'Static\'" errors.Additionally there were many errors like "Invalid markup extension type: expected type is \'<type>\', actual type is \'...Extension\'".The problem resolved itself when I added a reference to the System.Xaml assembly.No soft caches removal solutions worked for me, it looks like there were issues generated between different RS versions installed over the years.What worked for me was:All the settings need to be redone, etc but I couldnt get any better solution even with help of JetBrains team.It should be a problem related to Resharper cache, but as far as I know, the "clear cache" feature works only if your cache is in Solution Folder.\nTo check try this:\nVisual Studio > Tools > Options > Resharper > Options ...In Resharper Options window > Environment > General \ncheck that "Store solution caches in" it\'s set to "Solution folder"After this in solution folder you should see a new folder "_ReSharper.Caches". You should be able to clean it by pressing the "Clear caches" button, but (if this doesn\'t work) you can clean manually by removing inside files (in this case, Visual Studio has already to be closed).Restart Visual Studio and everything should work.\nHave a look here [1] as well[1] https://resharper-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206546989-ReSharper-stopped-working-for-a-single-specific-solutionNote: Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 / ReSharper 10.0.2I was having the same issue in my Visual Studio 2015 with Resharper Ultimate and tried the solutions as suggested above, but none worked for me. Then upgrading Resharper to latest release solved my issue.For me, inspecting the solution gave me hundreds of errors, including many "cannot find file in search paths". I tried every suggestion out there to fix it and none of them worked. I ended up finding out inspecting the project, instead of the solution, worked perfectly.I just want to report my solution in case anyone has the similar situation as I do. I have Visual Studio 2013 with update 5 and ReSharper 8.2.3. My project is ASP.NET MVC 5.Normally, I\'m good at keep updating my extension packages. Just recently, I found out all my views are red and showing "cannot resolve view xxxx". I tried the clear cache and suspend ReSharper and resume ReSharper solution, but the error will come back once I build the project. I checked my ReSharper extensions, and then I uninstalled the resharper.ExternalAnnotations package (8.2.3005) and re-install the previous version from gallery (8.2.3000.5176). \nThis seems to have fixed my problem. I tried all of the above solutions numerous times but none worked for me. I was using Visual Studio 2015 with ReSharper 9.0. I was able to resolve this by upgrading to ReSharper 9.2. If you already have the latest update for your major version, maybe reinstalling ReSharper might fix this for you. I would suggest clearing you ReShaper cache first, just in case.Here\'s the link to the archive versions of ReSharper: \nhttps://resharper-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/207242355-Where-can-I-download-an-old-previous-ReSharper-version-What helped in my case after several of the suggestions above didn\'t:After that, it worked fine, even though none of the project files were actually modified in the process.Resharper -> Options\nCaches -> Store solution caches in: (Change folder to another one).Or try to manually clean up R# cache folderI had the same problem (VS 2017). In my case it was different versions of target framework - one assembly targeted 4.52, another 4.62 - after setting those to the same version in both assemblies it started working again.I tested ALL of the other answers in this page (before writing this answer) such as:VS -> Tools -> Options -> ReSharper Suspend button and ResumeClear ReSharper cacheAnd othersBut unfortunately none of them solved my problem. Maybe my problem was complicated than your problem. I said about them in my EDITs in the question, then the following answer was correct solution for me but maybe other answers solve your problem. please test them first.I was forced to reinstall my OS and use a newer version of my tools. :(Now i use VS 2013 + R# v8 and when i have any problem with my resharper i just try the following instruction and it solve my problems:VS -> Tools -> Options -> ReSharper Suspend button and Resume
