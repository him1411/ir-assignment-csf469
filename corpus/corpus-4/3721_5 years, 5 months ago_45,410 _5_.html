Is there a way to amend a commit without vi (or your $EDITOR) popping up with the option to modify your commit message, but simply reusing the previous message?Since git 1.7.9 version you can also use git commit --amend --no-edit to get your result.Note that this will not include metadata from the other commit such as the timestamp which may or may not be important to you.git commit -C HEAD --amend will do what you want.  The -C option takes the metadata from another commit.Another (silly) possibility is to git commit --amend <<< :wq if you\'ve got vi(m) as $EDITOR.
