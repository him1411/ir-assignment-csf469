I guess everyone has seen a README file, but I would like the definitive guide on how to write an excellent README file with the least amount of energy spent on it.Side note: As an example that satisfies "OMG this is an excellent README!" and\n  "OMG this README is useless", I posted a link to gnome-cups-manager\'s\n  README as a comment. The comment is now removed probably due to dead\n  link so I copied the content to this\n  gist.As others have noted, README should be simple and short, but a good README can save time especially if it\'s for something like command-line parameter parsing library.Here\'s what I think it should include:Apache HTTP Server has a simple yet good README. Another good one I found available online is GNU Make\'s README.As per formatting, I would say stick to the Unix traditions as much as possible, and/or use markdown especially for github projects, which renders README.md as html.Putting it all together...Wikipedia defines as:A readme (or read me) file contains information about other files in a directory or archive and is very commonly distributed with computer software.and it lists the following contents:I think most READMEs are way too verbose.  A README is the first file a person should read when encountering a source tree, and it should be written as a very brief, very basic introduction to the software.  It should contain the name of the code, the version, possibly last date updated, and a very brief, high-level overview of the software (very high-level).  And that\'s all, other than possibly references to which files contain other information that a person might be interested in such as installation instructions (in INSTALL), the authors (in AUTHORS), or history (in ChangeLog or ReleaseNotes).The README is an introduction.  It should assume the reader knows absolutely nothing about the software and should provide a brief introduction.  If software were a screenplay, the README would be the elevator pitch.  If a person finishes reading the first 10 lines of frobnicator/README and still does not know if frobnicator is a widget library, accounting software, or a video game, then the author of the README has failed.It is a plain text file (the plainer the better), named "README" (or "readme" or "ReadMe", and possible with a ".txt" extension if your OS makes you) which says:All the above answers refer to READMEs created for a program/library. However, when you are creating a Readme for a school project, the perspective is different. You would want to highlight the following in this case:Hope the above helps any student who has to write a Readme for his professor.I was also looking for some formatting guidelines about README\'s, especially "traditional" ones with NAME, DESCRIPTION, SYNOPSIS, AUTHORS sections (example Man page of GNUCHESS).One related link I found is: Russ\'s Documentation Style:These guidelines are for documenting software distributions of open source software. They are applicable to C, Perl, and Java projects, and even projects that may not contain any compiled software. [...]\n  Any application should contain, at the top level, the following documentation files: ... LICENSE [...] NEWS [...] README [...] TODO\n  The documentation should at a minimum include NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, EXAMPLES, AUTHOR or AUTHORS, and COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE sections in that order. If it has any command-line options, there should also be an OPTIONS section immediately following the DESCRIPTION section. These should all be =head1 sections in POD. Now that POD is mentioned, it stands for Plain Old Documentation style for Perl software.I found also GNU Coding Standards - 6.9 Man Pages, but it doesn\'t talk much about documentation style.I thought I had other similar resources found as well, but I cannot find them in my current browser session :/ If I find some again, I\'ll be sure to update this post...Cheers!It\'s the instructions to the person using your "product" to get it installed and figure out where to find more detailed information. If providing a little extra background information helps with that, then include that as well. It should be very succinct.I think of README as answering "What the heck is this?"What I want to find in a README:Personally I don\'t think copyright or licensing info should ever be in a README (just reference a separate, self-explanatory file called COPYRIGHT or something) since this implicitly trains people not to read READMEs.Go to Github and see all the projects. All most every project has a README file and you can get a very good idea from there.Cheers.
