I read once that git commit messages should be in the imperative present tense, e.g. "Add tests for x". I always find myself using the past tense, e.g. "Added tests for x" though, which feels a lot more natural to me.Here\'s a recent John Resig commit showing the two in one message:Tweak some more jQuery set results in the manipulation tests. Also fixed the order of the expected test results. Does it matter? Which should I use?The preference for present-tense, imperative-style commit messages comes from Git itself. From Documentation/SubmittingPatches in the Git repo:the body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:\n    - uses the imperative, present tense: "change", not "changed" or "changes".So you\'ll see a lot of Git commit messages written in that style. But it doesn\'t matter -- you can do whatever you prefer.Your project should almost always use the past tense.  In any case, the project should always use the same tense for consistency and clarity.I understand some of the other arguments arguing to use the present tense, but they usually don\'t apply.  The following bullet points are common arguments for writing in the present tense, and my response.This is the most correct reason one would want to use the present tense, but only with the right style of project.  This manner of thinking considers all commits as optional improvements or features, and you are free to decide which commits to keep and which to reject in your particular repository.This argument works if you are dealing with a truly distributed project.  If you are dealing with a distributed project, you are probably working on an open source project. And it is probably a very large project if it is really distributed.  In fact, it\'s probably either the Linux kernel or Git.  Since Linux is likely what caused Git to spread and gain in popularity, it\'s easy to understand why people would consider its style the authority.  Yes, the style makes sense with those two projects.  Or, in general, it works with large, open source, distributed projects.That being said, most projects in source control do not work like this.  It is usually incorrect for most repositories.  It\'s a modern way of thinking about a commits: Subversion (SVN) and CVS repositories could barely support this style of repository check-ins.  Usually an integration branch handled filtering bad check-ins, but those generally weren\'t considered "optional" or "nice-to-have features".In most scenarios, when you are making commits to a source repository, you are writing a journal entry which describes what changed with this update, to make it easier for others in the future to understand why a change was made. It generally isn\'t an optional change - other people in the project are required to either merge or rebase on it.  You don\'t write a diary entry such as "Dear diary, today I meet a boy and he says hello to me.", but instead you write "I met a boy and he said hello to me."Finally, for such non-distributed projects, 99.99% of the time a person will be reading a commit message is for reading history - history is read in the past tense.  0.01% of the time it will be deciding whether or not they should apply this commit or integrate it into their branch/repository.No, I guarantee you that the majority of projects ever logged in a version control system have had their history in the past tense (I don\'t have references, but it\'s probably right, considering the present tense argument is new since Git).  "Revision" messages or commit messages in the present tense only started making sense in truly distributed projects - see the first point above. See the first point. 99.99% of the time a person will be reading a commit message is for reading history - history is read in the past tense.  0.01% of the time it will be deciding whether or not they should apply this commit or integrate it into their branch/repository.  99.99% beats 0.01%.I\'ve never seen a good argument that says use improper tense/grammar because it\'s shorter.  You\'ll probably only save 3 characters on average for a standard 50 character message.  That being said, the present tense on average will probably be a few characters shorter.Tickets are written as either something that is currently happening (e.g. the app is showing the wrong behavior when I click this button), or something that needs to be done in the future (e.g. the text will need a review by the editor).  History (i.e. commit messages) is written as something that was done in the past (e.g. the problem was fixed).I wrote a fuller description on 365git.The use of the imperative, present tense is one that takes a little\n  getting used to. When I started mentioning it, it was met with\n  resistance. Usually along the lines of \xe2\x80\x9cThe commit message records\n  what I have done\xe2\x80\x9d. But, Git is a distributed version control system\n  where there are potentially many places to get changes from. Rather\n  than writing messages that say what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done; consider these\n  messages as the instructions for what applying the commit will do.\n  Rather than having a commit with the title:Renamed the iVars and removed the common prefix.Have one like this:Rename the iVars to remove the common prefixWhich tells someone what applying the commit will do, rather than what\n  you did. Also, if you look at your repository history you will see\n  that the Git generated messages are written in this tense as well -\n  \xe2\x80\x9cMerge\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cMerged\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cRebase\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cRebased\xe2\x80\x9d so writing in the same\n  tense keeps things consistent. It feels strange at first but it does\n  make sense (testimonials available upon application) and eventually\n  becomes natural.Having said all that - it\xe2\x80\x99s your code, your repository: so set up your\n  own guidelines and stick to them.If, however, you do decide to go this way then git rebase -i with the\n  reword option would be a good thing to look into.Stick with the present tense imperative becauseWho are you writing the message for?  And is that reader typically reading the message pre- or post- ownership the commit themselves?  I think good answers here have been given from both perspectives, I\xe2\x80\x99d perhaps just fall short of suggesting there is a best answer for every project.  The split vote might suggest as much. i.e. to summarise:Is the message predominantly for other people, typically reading at some point before they have assumed the change: A proposal of what taking the change will do to their existing code.Is the message predominantly as a journal/record to yourself (or to your team), but typically reading from the perspective of having assumed the change and searching back to discover what happened.Perhaps this will lead the motivation for your team/project, either way.does it matter? people are generally smart enough to interpret messages correctly, if they aren\'t you probably shouldn\'t let them access your repository anyway!It is up to you. Just use the commit message as you wish.\nBut it is easier if you are not switching between times and languages.And if you develop in a team - it should be discussed and set fixed.I think you are free to use either of the tenses. I even use Present Continuous sometimes Adding feature X.
