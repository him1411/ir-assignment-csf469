To make a JavaScript class with a public method I\'d do something like:That way users of my class can:How do I create a private method that can be called by the buy_food and use_restroom methods but not externally by users of the class?In other words, I want my method implementation to be able to do:But this shouldn\'t work:How do I define private_stuff as a private method so both of these hold true?I\'ve read Doug Crockford\'s writeup a few times but it doesn\'t seem like "private" methods can be called by public methods and "privileged" methods can be called externally.You can do it, but the downside is that it can\'t be part of the prototype:You can simulate private methods like this:More information on this technique here: http://webreflection.blogspot.com/2008/04/natural-javascript-private-methods.htmlJavaScript uses prototypes and does\'t have classes (or methods for that matter) like Object Oriented languages. A JavaScript developer need to think in JavaScript.Wikipedia quote:Unlike many object-oriented languages, there is no distinction between\n  a function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction\n  occurs during function calling; when a function is called as a method\n  of an object, the function\'s local this keyword is bound to that\n  object for that invocation.Solution using a self invoking function and the call function to call the private "method" :The call function allows us to call the private function with the appropriate context (this).If you are using node.js, you don\'t need the IIFE because you can take advantage of the module loading system:Load the file:The bind operator :: is an ECMAScript proposal and is implemented in Babel (stage 0).Load the file:In these situations when you have a public API, and you would like private and public methods/properties, I always use the Module Pattern. This pattern was made popular within the YUI library, and the details can be found here:http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/It is really straightforward, and easy for other developers to comprehend. For a simple example:Here is the class which I created to understand what Douglas Crockford\'s has suggested in his site Private Members in JavaScriptI conjured up this: EDIT: Actually, someone has linked to a identical solution. Duh!I think such questions come up again and again because of the lack of understanding of the  closures. \xd0\xa1losures is most important thing in JS. Every JS programmer have to feel the essence of it.1. First of all we need to make separate scope (closure).2. In this area, we can do whatever we want. And no one will know about it.3. For the world to know about our restaurant class, \nwe have to return it from the closure.4. At the end, we have:5. Also, this approach has potential for inheritance and templatingI hope this helps someone better understand this subjectAll of this closure will cost you.  Make sure you test the speed implications especially in IE. You will find you are better off with a naming convention. There are still a lot of corporate web users out there that are forced to use IE6...Take any of the solutions that follow Crockford\'s private or priviledged pattern. For example:In any case where the attacker has no "execute" right on the JS context he has no way of accessing any "public" or "private" fields or methods. In case the attacker does have that access he can execute this one-liner:Note that the above code is generic to all constructor-type-privacy. It will fail with some of the solutions here but it should be clear that pretty much all of the closure based solutions can be broken like this with different replace() parameters. After this is executed any object created with new Foo() is going to have an eval method which can be called to return or change values or methods defined in the constructor\'s closure, e.g.:The only problem I can see with this that it won\'t work for cases where there is only one instance and it\'s created on load. But then there is no reason to actually define a prototype and in that case the attacker can simply recreate the object instead of the constructor as long as he has a way of passing the same parameters (e.g. they are constant or calculated from available values).In my opinion, this pretty much makes Crockford\'s solution useless. Since the "privacy" is easily broken the downsides of his solution (reduced readability & maintainability, decreased performance, increased memory) makes the "no privacy" prototype based method the better choice. I do usually use leading underscores to mark __private and _protected methods and fields (Perl style), but the idea of having privacy in JavaScript just shows how it\'s a misunderstood language. Therefore I disagree with Crockford except for his first sentence.So how do you get real privacy in JS? Put everything that is required to be private on the server side and use JS to do AJAX calls.The apotheosis of the Module Pattern: The Revealing Module PatternA neat little extension to a very robust pattern.If you want the full range of public and private functions with the ability for public functions to access private functions, layout code for an object like this:I think the problem with @domgblackwell\'s and @James\'s approach is that prototype methods will be defined over and over with every instance created.\nHowever since it\'s an override it may be a non-issue from memory aspect. It loses points on elegance though, cause it\'s quite ugly to define those methods every time.What about this?Private variable lookup is impossible outside of the scope of the immediate function.\nThere is no duplication of functions, saving memory.The downside is that the lookup of private variables is clunky privateVars[this.id].cooked is ridiculous to type. There is also an extra "id" variable.Similar to georgebrock but a little less verbose (IMHO)\nAny problems with doing it this way? (I haven\'t seen it anywhere)edit: I realised this is kinda useless since every independent instantiation has its own copy of the public methods, thus undermining the use of the prototype.The module pattern is right in most cases. But if you have thousands of instances, classes save memory. If saving memory is a concern and your objects contain a small amount of private data, but have a lot of public functions, then you\'ll want all public functions to live in the .prototype to save memory.This is what I came up with:The object priv contains private properties. It is accessible through the public function getPriv(), but this function returns false unless you pass it the secret, and this is only known inside the main closure.Wrap all code in Anonymous Function: Then , all functions will be private ,ONLY  functions attached  to window object : Use this : Personally, I prefer the following pattern for creating classes in JavaScript :As you can see, it allows you to define both class properties and instance properties, each of which can be public and private.See also this Fiddle.Private functions cannot access the public variables using module patternSince everybody was posting here his own code, I\'m gonna do that too...I like Crockford because he introduced real object oriented patterns in Javascript. But he also came up with a new misunderstanding, the "that" one.So why is he using "that = this"? It has nothing to do with private functions at all. It has to do with inner functions! Because according to Crockford this is buggy code: So he suggested doing this:So as I said, I\'m quite sure that Crockford was wrong his explanation about that and this (but his code is certainly correct). Or was he just fooling the Javascript world, to know who is copying his code? I dunno...I\'m no browser geek ;DEDITAh, that\'s what is all about: What does 'var that = this;' mean in JavaScript?So Crockie was really wrong with his explanation....but right with his code, so he\'s still a great guy. :))In general I added the private Object _ temporarily to the object.\nYou have to open the privacy exlipcitly in the "Power-constructor" for the method.\nIf you call the method from the prototype, you will\nbe able to overwrite the prototype-methodMake a public method accessible in the "Power-constructor": (ctx is the object context)Now I have this openPrivacy:This is what I worked out:Needs one class of sugar code that you can find here. Also supports protected, inheritance, virtual, static stuff...https://github.com/nooning/JSClassI have created a new tool to allow you to have true private methods on the prototype\nhttps://github.com/TremayneChrist/ProtectJSExample:You have to put a closure around your actual constructor-function, where you can define your private methods.\nTo change data of the instances through these private methods, you have to give them "this" with them, either as an function argument or by calling this function with .apply(this) :Here\'s what i enjoyed the most so far regarding private/public methods/members and instantiation in javascript:here is the article: http://www.sefol.com/?p=1090and here is the example:JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/northkildonan/kopj3dt3/1/I know it\'s a bit too late but how about this?There are many answers on this question already, but nothing fitted my needs. So i came up with my own solution, I hope it is usefull for someone:As you can see this system works when using this type of classes in javascript. As far as I figured out none of the methods commented above did.See this answer for a a clean & simple \'class\' solution with a private and public interface and support for composition
