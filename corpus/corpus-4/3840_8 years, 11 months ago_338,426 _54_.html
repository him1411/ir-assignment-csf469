Is there a good way to remove HTML from a Java string?  A simple regex like will work, but things like &amp; wont be converted correctly and non-HTML between the two angle brackets will be removed (i.e. the .*? in the regex will disappear).  Use a HTML parser instead of regex. This is dead simple with Jsoup.Jsoup also supports removing HTML tags against a customizable whitelist, which is very useful if you want to allow only e.g. <b>, <i> and <u>.If you\'re writing for Android you can do this...If the user enters <b>hey!</b>, do you want to display <b>hey!</b> or hey!?  If the first, escape less-thans, and html-encode ampersands (and optionally quotes) and you\'re fine.  A modification to your code to implement the second option would be:but you will run into issues if the user enters something malformed, like <bhey!</b>.You can also check out JTidy which will parse "dirty" html input, and should give you a way to remove the tags, keeping the text.The problem with trying to strip html is that browsers have very lenient parsers, more lenient than any library you can find will, so even if you do your best to strip all tags (using the replace method above, a DOM library, or JTidy), you will still need to make sure to encode any remaining HTML special characters to keep your output safe.Another way is to use  javax.swing.text.html.HTMLEditorKit to extract the text.ref : Remove HTML tags from a file to extract only the TEXT Also very simple using Jericho, and you can retain some of the formatting (line breaks and links, for example).I think that the simpliest way to filter the html tags is:On Android, try this:HTML Escaping is really hard to do right- I\'d definitely suggest using library code to do this, as it\'s a lot more subtle than you\'d think. Check out Apache\'s StringEscapeUtils for a pretty good library for handling this in Java.The accepted answer of doing simply Jsoup.parse(html).text() has 2 potential issues (with JSoup 1.7.3):If you use this to protect against XSS, this is a bit annoying. Here is my best shot at an improved solution, using both JSoup and Apache StringEscapeUtils:Note that the last step is because I need to use the output as plain text. If you need only HTML output then you should be able to remove it.And here is a bunch of test cases (input to output):If you find a way to make it better, please let me know.You might want to replace <br/> and </p> tags with newlines before stripping the HTML to prevent it becoming an illegible mess as Tim suggests.The only way I can think of removing HTML tags but leaving non-HTML between angle brackets would be check against a list of HTML tags. Something along these lines...Then HTML-decode special characters such as &amp;. The result should not be considered to be sanitized.The accepted answer did not work for me for the test case I indicated: the result of "a < b or b > c" is "a b or b > c".So, I used TagSoup instead.  Here\'s a shot that worked for my test case (and a couple of others):Here\'s a lightly more fleshed out update to try to handle some formatting for breaks and lists. I used Amaya\'s output as a guide.  Use Html.fromHtmlHTML Tags areAs per Android\xe2\x80\x99s official Documentations any  tags in the HTML will display as a generic replacement String which your program can then go through and replace with real strings.Html.formHtml method takes an Html.TagHandler and an Html.ImageGetter as arguments as well as the text to parse.ThenOutputThis is about me text that the user can put into their profileOne more way can be to use com.google.gdata.util.common.html.HtmlToText class \nlike This is not bullet proof code though and when I run it on wikipedia entries I am getting style info also. However I believe for small/simple jobs this would be effective.I know this is old, but I was just working on a project that required me to filter HTML and this worked fine:instead of this:It sounds like you want to go from HTML to plain text.\nIf that is the case look at www.htmlparser.org.  Here is an example that strips all the tags out from the html file found at a URL.\nIt makes use of org.htmlparser.beans.StringBean.Here is another way to do it:One could also use Apache Tika for this purpose. By default it preserves whitespaces from the stripped html, which may be desired in certain situations:Alternatively, one can use HtmlCleaner:My 5 cents:To get formateed plain html text you can do that:To get formateed plain text change <br/> by \\n and change last line by:Remove HTML tags from string. Somewhere we need to parse some string which is received by some responses like Httpresponse from the server.So we need to parse it.Here I will show how to remove html tags from string.One way to retain new-line info with JSoup is to precede all new line tags with some dummy string, execute JSoup and replace dummy string with "\\n".This should work - use thisand thisyou can simply make a method with multiple replaceAll() likeUse this link for most common replacements you need:\nhttp://tunes.org/wiki/html_20special_20characters_20and_20symbols.htmlIt is simple but effective. I use this method first to remove the junk but not the very first line i.e replaceAll("\\<.*?>",""), and later i use specific keywords to search for indexes and then use .substring(start, end) method to strip away unnecessary stuff. As this is more robust and you can pin point exactly what you need in the entire html page.
