I\'ve been doing all my work in Git and pushing to GitHub. I\'ve been very happy with both the software and the site and I have no wish to change my working practices at this point.My PhD adviser is asking all students to keep their work in an SVN repository that\'s hosted at the university. I\'ve found tons of documentation and tutorials about to pull down an existing SVN repo into git, but nothing about pushing a git repo to a fresh SVN repo. I expect there must be some way to do this with a combination of git-svn and a fresh branch and rebasing and all those wonderful terms, but I\'m a git newbie and don\'t feel confident with any of them.I then want to just run a couple of commands to push commits to that SVN repo when I choose, I wish to keep using Git and just have the SVN repo mirror what\'s in Git.I\'ll be the only person ever committing to SVN, if this makes any difference.Any instructions on how to do this would be very much appreciated!I needed this as well, and with the help of Bombe\'s answer + some fiddling around, I got it working. Here\'s the recipe:After #3 you\'ll get a cryptic message like this:Using higher level of URL: protocol:///path/to/repo/PROJECT => protocol:///path/to/repoJust ignore that.When you run #5, you might get conflicts. Resolve these by adding files with state "unmerged" and resuming rebase. Eventually, you\'ll be done; Then sync back to the svn-repo, using dcommit. That\'s all.You can now sync from svn -> git, using the following commands:And to sync from git -> svn, use:You might want to try this out on a local copy, before applying to a live repo. You can make a copy of your git-repo to a temporary place, simply using cp -r, as all data is in the repo itself. You can then set up a file-based testing repo, using:And check a working copy out, using:That\'ll allow you to play around with things before making any lasting changes.If you accidentally run git svn init with the wrong url, and you weren\'t smart enough to take a backup of your work (don\'t ask ...), you can\'t just run the same command again. You can however undo the changes by issuing:And remove the section [svn-remote "svn"] section.You can then run git svn init anew.Here\'s how we made it work :Clone your git repo somwhere on your machine.\nOpen .git/config and add the following(from http://www.kerrybuckley.org/2009/10/06/maintaining-a-read-only-svn-mirror-of-a-git-repository/):now, from a console window, type these :Now, if it breaks here for whatever reason, type these 3 lines :and finally, you can commit to svnnote: I always scrap that folder afterwards.cheers !Using git rebase directly will lost the first commit. Git treats it different and cant rebase it.There is a procedure that will preserve full history: http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2008/10/26/3815034I will transcribe the solution here, but credits are for Bj\xc3\xb6rn.Initialize git-svn:The --prefix gives you remote tracking branches like "svn/trunk" which\nis nice because you don\'t get ambiguous names if you call your local\nbranch just "trunk" then. And -s is a shortcut for the standard\ntrunk/tags/branches layout.Fetch the initial stuff from svn:Now look up the hash of your root commit (should show a single commit):Then get the hash of the empty trunk commit:Create the graft:Now, "gitk" should show svn/trunk as the first commit on which your\nmaster branch is based.Make the graft permanent:Drop the graft:gitk should still show svn/trunk in the ancestry of masterLinearize your history on top of trunk:And now "git svn dcommit -n" should tell you that it is going to commit\nto trunk.Create a new directory in the subversion repository for your project.Change to your Git-managed project and initialize git-svn.This will create a single commit because your svn project directory is still empty. Now rebase everything on that commit, git svn dcommit and you should be done. It will seriously mess up your commit dates, though.Git -> SVN with complete commit historyI had a git project and had to move it to SVN. This is how I made it, keeping the whole commit history. The only thing that gets lost is the original commit time since libSVN will set the local time when we git svn dcommit.Howto:1) Have a svn repository where we want to import our stuff to and clone it with git-svn:git svn clone https://path.to/svn/repository repo.git-svn2) Go there:cd repo.git-svn3) Add the remote of the git repository (in this example Im using C:/Projects/repo.git) you want to push to svn and give it the name old-git:git remote add old-git file:///C/Projects/repo.git/4) fetch the information from the master branch from the old-git repo to the current repo:git fetch old-git master5) checkout the master branch of the old-git remote into a new branch called old in the current repo:git checkout -b old old-git/master6) Rebase to put the HEAD on top of old-git/master. This will maintain all your commits. What this does basically is to take all of your work done in git and put it on top of the work you are accessing from svn.git rebase master7) Now go back to your master branch:git checkout masterand you can see that you have a clean commit history. This is what you want to push to svn.8) Push your work to svn:git svn dcommitThats all. Very clean, no hacking, everything works perfectly out of the box. Enjoy.I would propose a very short instruction in 4 commands using SubGit. See this post for details.http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/ImportingFromGitI needed to commit my existing Git repo to an empty SVN repo.This is how I managed to do this:Worked without problems. I hope this helps someone.Since I had to authorize myself with a different username to the svn repo (my origin uses private/public key auth), I had to use the --username property.If you want to keep on working with git as your main repository and just need to "export" the revisions to svn from time to time, you could use tailor to keep the svn repository in sync. It can copy revisions between different source control systems and would update the svn with the changes you make in git.I haven\'t tried a git -> svn conversion, but for a svn -> svn example see this answer.If you don\'t have to use any specific svn and you are using Github you can use their svn connector.More info here https://github.com/blog/1178-collaborating-on-github-with-subversionI would like to share a great tool being utilized in the WordPress community called Scatterhttp://evansolomon.me/notes/git-wordpress-plugins-and-a-bit-of-sanity-scatter/This enables users to be able to send their git repo to WordPress.org SVN automatically. In theory, this code can be applied to any SVN repo.You can make a new svn repo. Export your git project (fleshing out the .git files).\nAdd it to the svn repo (initializing the repo with what you had so far in git).\nThen use the instructions for importing svn repos in a fresh git project.But this will loose your previous git history. In my case, I had to initiate a clean project from SVNadd all your project sources...I know this is a very old question, but I recently had to migrate several Git repos to SVN, and after trying all solutions I could find, what finally worked for me was Mercurial (yes, using a third VCS). Using this guide, I came up with the following process (on Linux, but the basic idea should work on Windows as well).The necessary packages:Mercurial needs to be configured by adding the following to ~/.hgrc:Create some temporary working directories (I had several repos to migrate so I created directories for the SVN and Git versions, to keep them separate):Make an empty local SVN repository:Clone the existing Git repository:Let Mercurial do its thing:Now the SVN repo should contain the full commit history, but not with original timestamps. If this is not an issue, skip over the next part to step 11.With a little work, the date and time of each commit can be changed. Since my repos are fairly small, it was feasible for me to do it manually. First, create a pre-revprop-change hook in the SVN repo with the following contents, to allow the necessary property to be modified:This script has to be made executable:Mercurial created a working copy of the SVN repo, named project-wc, so switch to it and edit the commit times:Enter the correct date and time (pay attention to timezones!) and save, you should get a message saying "Set new value for property svn:date on revision 1".\nNow rinse and repeat for every other revision.Optionally check the commit history to make sure everything looks OK:Then go back up one level:Dump the repository:And load the dump on your Subversion server. Done!This process would probably also work directly between remote repositories, but I found it easier to work with local ones. Fixing the commit times was a lot of work, but overall the process was much more straightforward than any other method I found.Just want to share some my experience with the accepted answer. I did all steps and all was fine before I run the last step$ git svn dcommitUse of uninitialized value $u in substitution (s///) at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.22/Git/SVN.pm line 101.Use of uninitialized value $u in concatenation (.) or string at /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.22/Git/SVN.pm line 101.\n  refs/remotes/origin/HEAD: \'https://192.168.2.101/svn/PROJECT_NAME\' not found in \'\'I found this thread \nhttps://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git/issues/50and finally the solution which I applied in the following file in line 101\n/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.22/Git/SVN.pmI replaced I replaces with This fixed my issueWhat if you don\'t want to commit EVERY commit that you make in Git, to the SVN repository? What if you just want to selectively send commits up the pipe? Well. I have a better solution.I keep one local git repo where all I ever do is fetch and merge from SVN. That way I can make sure I\'m including all the same changes as SVN, but I keep my commit history separate from the SVN entirely.Then I keep a separate SVN local working copy that is in a separate folder. That\'s the one I make commits back to SVN from, and I simply use the SVN command line utility for that. When I\'m ready to commit my local git repo\'s state to SVN then I simply copy the whole mess of files over into the local SVN working copy and commit it from there using SVN rather than git.This way I never have to do any rebasing, because rebasing is like freebasing.
