I\'ve run out of space on a virtual machine disk which is a vmdk and need to resize the virtual image. Resizing with the command gives the error How can I resize a vmdk image?yes, Brian, you are right: those are the steps, but if you want to end having back a vmdk hard disk (maybe you are interested in using the disk in vwmare too) you miss one more step. So the complete howto is:The above will resize the hard disk up to 50GB (50 * 1024MB).\n\n\nTo complete things you need to resize the drive too! To achieve this, you might want to download gparted iso and boot from that iso to resize your drive (select the iso from within the virtualbox settings).P.S. If your new size is too small, you\'ll get the same error even with your new vdi file.I was able to resize the vmdk by cloning it and then modifying and resizing.I have a Windows 7 client on a Mac host and this post was VERY helpful. Thanks. I would add that I didn\'t use gparted. I did this:Sweet! I preferred that to using a 3rd party tool with warnings about data loss.Cheers!VBoxManage does the trick, but don\'t forget that you have to use GParted or another tool to allocate the free space created with VBoxManage.Have a look to my blog post to get detailed information and step by step screenshots.Actually, Only this these commands are needed:Then, you can select cloned.dvi in Virtualbox GUI storage. After that, start the virtual windows and expand your C disk as the methods of Code Chops.It is not necessary to convert the *.vdi file to *.vmdk file back.You can use Vmware player to resize a vmdk. \nThis removes the round trip conversion (noted in other posts) if you want to keep it in vmdk format. Just make sure that when you add the vmdk into vmware, don\'t click upgrade format when prompted, keep the current one in case VirtualBox doesn\'t accept it.Since this is a vmdk file, you could use VMWare\'s vdiskmanager, if it\'s available for your platform. VMWare has x86 Linux, Windows, and OS X versions here.And then you just do:It avoids having to clone, then expand the disk. Now, the downside is you need the extra tool, and vmdk is VMWare\'s disk format, and you\'re still using Virtualbox, so there could be incompatibilities.qemu-img might also work, but I\'m not sure if it supports resizing vmdk files. It would look something like:And just a reminder, with both, you still have to grow the partition after resizing the underlying disk. All these tools are essentially dd if=/dev/old_disk of=/dev/new_disk bs=16M.For shrinking image size I use the following steps:I\'ve got here because I needed to resize a disk for my Docker (CoreOS) development environment.CoreOS docs says there\'s no need to resize the OS partition - that\'s bogus. After you resize the virtual disk you should follow these instructions and resize the OS partition via GParted: https://docs.docker.com/articles/b2d_volume_resize/VirtualBox for WindowsResizing your disk file while preserving your virtual machine settings!Start cmd.execd to Oracle VM VirtualBox\'s dir (on 64-bit systems:  "C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\")Run these commands (as above):Windows explorer and "copy address as text" via the address bar should help you get the path you need.On windows system, The VirtaulBox VM directory underneath your user may contain an XML formatted database file of settings you\'ve configured for your VM.  Rename this file, with a .bak extension (it has a .vbox extension). Rename the original .vmdk file with a .bak extension as well to avoid another error.  You can now safetly perform the third step without the error message to convert the machine back to .vmdk format, or the "duplicate disk" error.You will be presented with a UID token.  Copy this token by drag-highlighting it from the Windows Command Interpetor window and using the Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut.Open the .vbox.bak file in a text editor such as Notepad++.  You\'ll be presented with an XML-like database file.  Look for these lines:On the line <HardDisk uuid="{some uid}" location="C:\\path_to\\source.vmdk" ..., delete the old UID token between the brackets and paste the one you copied from the command window.  Make sure that you leave the brackets in place!Save this file, and exit your text editor.  Rename the .vbox.bak file to give it back its expected extension of .vbox.It is now safe to remove the .bak files remaining in the directory.  What remains is a resized .vmdk with an updated .vbox database while with your previously preserved VirtualBox Manager settings.You can now start the VirtualBox VM Manager and execute your VM, using the appropriate tools for the operating system to fill the new free space.For Windows VMs, use diskpart from the command prompt booted from the Windows Recovery Consule (recovery partition) to SELECT DISK 1, LIST PARTITION and gather the partition number of your C:\\ drive, then SELECT PARTITION #.  You can use the EXTEND SIZE=mb to resize the Windows C:\\ drive to the appropriate value.  Make sure you leave room for the recovery and boot partitions!  It\'s safe to subtract 4096 MB from your new virtual disk size to get this value, because of shadow copy and windows recovery files.For Linux VMs, a live .ISO of gparted you can boot with the VM\'s disk file can be found at:  http://gparted.org/  It will get you straight into a graphical user interface-based gparted-gtk, from where you can fill your free space.  For PPC / Mac VMs, Disk Utility from the Finder will asisst you in filling the free space, but you may want to consider the gparted Linux option, as currently the only method of which to boot MacOSX in VirtualBox is hackintosh, and you cannot extend your volume while booted into MacOSX.  You may also want to seek out tweaking the VM\'s settings temporarily for gparted, to get it to boot.  MacOSX partitions are recognized by gparted as HFS - "Heaping File System" partitions.Because the internet.  ;)  You\'re finished.  Enjoy your new resized virtual .vmdk disk image with VirtualBox for Windows!A quick and simple option:Move content from old disk to inside new disk:Turn on machineWarningIf new disk is shorter than source, you will loss the data located from the new disk size position on the source disk.You may prevent this deallocating delta space, where delta = size(source-disk) - size(new-disk), at the end of source disk inside OS before step 1.Here\'s a way to resize your VirtualBox disk, regardless of whether it is a fixed format or dynamic format disk. Specifically, it prevents the error you had when you disk is fixed-format.\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f Backup the virtual disk. You never know what might go wrong.On your host:Open a terminal window.On Windows: Open the command prompt cmd.Go to the directory with the virtual disk you want to resize. For example:Create a new VirtualBox disk with your desired filename, size (in megabytes) and format (either Standard (dynamic) or Fixed). For example, to create a 50 GB fixed-format disk called MyNewDisk.vdi:If VBoxManage is not recognized as a command, specify the full path to it. It can be found in the VirtualBox installation directory. On Windows the above command would become:Copy the original disk to the new disk.The resize is done! You can check the properties of the new disk if you want:Change the virtual machine to use the new disk instead.Next, on your guest OS you need to resize the partitions to use the newly available space.Download/Install/Use VMWare Workstation and create new VM Based on your current vmdk file and then you can resize your vmdk. For details regarding this matter google for VMWare.Simply you have to follow the following steps:Congratulation, enjoy your free space.\nThis video will help you:\nhttps://youtu.be/ikSIDI535L0
