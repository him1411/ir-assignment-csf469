I know there is the /etc/group file that lists all users groups.I would like to know if there is a simple command to list all user group names in spite of parsing the world readable /etc/group file. I am willing to create an administrator web page that lists Linux accounts\' group names.Have you tried this commandfor entire group list use For more info- >\nUnix groups\nCut commandIf you want all groups known to the system, I would recommend using getent instead of parsing /etc/group. On networked systems, groups may not only read from /etc/group file, but also obtained through LDAP or Yellow Pages, i.e. the list of known groups comes from the local groups file plus groups received via LDAP or YP.getent group will give you a list of all groups in the same format the /etc/group-file uses.If you want just the group names, getent group | cut -d: -f1 will do the job (same as above).On Linux/OS X/Unix to display the groups to which you belong, use:which is equivalent to groups utility which has been obsoleted on Unix.On OS X/Unix, the command id -p is suggested for normal interactive.Explanation on the parameters:-G, --groups - print all group IDs-n, --name - print a name instead of a number, for -ugG-p - Make the output human-readable.
