How do you stop tracking a remote branch in Git?I am asking to stop tracking because in my concrete case, I want to delete the local branch, but not the remote one. Deleting the local one and pushing the deletion to remote will delete the remote branch as well:Can I just do git branch -d the_branch, and it won\'t get propagated when I later git push? Will it only propagate if I were to run git push origin :the_branch later on?As mentioned in Yoshua Wuyts\' answer, using git branch:You don\'t have to delete your local branch.Simply delete your remote tracking branch:(This will not delete the branch on the remote repo!)See "Having a hard time understanding git-fetch"there\'s no such concept of local tracking branches, only remote tracking branches.\n  So origin/master is a remote tracking branch for master in the origin repoAs mentioned in Dobes Vandermeer\'s answer, you also need to reset the configuration associated to the local branch:Remove the upstream information for <branchname>.\n  If no branch is specified it defaults to the current branch.(git 1.8+, Oct. 2012, commit b84869e by Carlos Mart\xc3\xadn Nieto (carlosmn))That will make any push/pull completely unaware of origin/<remote branch name>.To remove the upstream for the current branch do:This is available for Git v.1.8.0 or newer.  (Sources: 1.7.9 ref, 1.8.0 ref)sourceTo remove the association between the local and remote branch run:Optionally delete the local branch afterwards if you don\'t need it:This won\'t delete the remote branch.The simplest way is to edit .git/configHere is an example fileDelete the line merge = refs/heads/test1 in the test1 branch sectionYou can delete the remote-tracking branch usingas VonC mentions above. However, if you keep your local copy of the branch, git push will still try to push that branch (which could give you a non-fast-forward error as it did for ruffin). This is because the config push.default defaults to matching which means:matching - push all matching branches. All branches having the same name in both ends are considered to be matching. This is the default.(see http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config under push.default)Seeing as this is probably not what you wanted when you deleted the remote-tracking branch, you can set push.default to upstream (or tracking if you have git < 1.7.4.3)upstream - push the current branch to its upstream branch.usingand git will stop trying to push branches that you have "stopped tracking."Note: The simpler solution would be to just rename your local branch to something else. That would eliminate some potential for confusion, as well.This is not an answer to the question, but I couldn\'t figure out how to get decent code formatting in a comment above... so auto-down-reputation-be-damned here\'s my comment.I have the recipe submtted by @Dobes in a fancy shmancy [alias] entry in my .gitconfig:Then I can just runHere\'s a one-liner to remove all remote-tracking branches matching a pattern:git branch -rd $(git branch -a | grep \'{pattern}\' | cut -d\'/\' -f2-10 | xargs)The easiest way to do this is to delete the branch remotely and then use:git fetch --prune (aka git fetch -p)
