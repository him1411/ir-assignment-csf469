I know how to get an intersection of two flat lists:or But when I have to find intersection for nested lists then my problems starts:In the end I would like to receive:Can you guys give me a hand with this?If you want:Then here is your solution for Python 2:In Python 3 filter returns an iterable instead of list, so you need to wrap filter calls with list():Explanation: The filter part takes each sublist\'s item and checks to see if it is in the source list c1. \nThe list comprehension is executed for each sublist in c2. You don\'t need to define intersection.  It\'s already a first-class part of set.For people just looking to find the intersection of two lists, the Asker provided two methods:andBut there is a hybrid method that is more efficient, because you only have to do one conversion between list/set, as opposed to three:This will run in O(n), whereas his original method involving list comprehension will run in O(n^2)Flatten variant:Nested variant:The functional approach:and it can be applied to the more general case of 1+ listsThe & operator takes the intersection of two sets.{1, 2, 3} & {2, 3, 4}\nOut[1]: {2, 3}You should flatten using this code ( taken from http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~meine/python_tricks ), the code is untested, but I\'m pretty sure it works:After you had flattened the list, you perform the intersection in the usual way:Since intersect was defined, a basic list comprehension is enough:Improvement thanks to S. Lott\'s remark and TM.\'s associated remark:A pythonic way of taking intersection of 2 lists is:Do you consider [1,2] to intersect with [1, [2]]? That is, is it only the numbers you care about, or the list structure as well?If only the numbers, investigate how to "flatten" the lists, then use the set() method.I don\'t know if I am late in answering your question. After reading your question I came up with a function intersect() that can work on both list and nested list. I used recursion to define this function, it is very intuitive. Hope it is what you are looking for:Example:Given:c1 = [1, 6, 7, 10, 13, 28, 32, 41, 58, 63]c2 = [[13, 17, 18, 21, 32], [7, 11, 13, 14, 28], [1, 5, 6, 8, 15, 16]]I find the following code works well and maybe more concise if using set operation:c3 = [list(set(f)&set(c1)) for f in c2] It got:[[32, 13], [28, 13, 7], [1, 6]]If order needed:c3 = [sorted(list(set(f)&set(c1))) for f in c2] we got:[[13, 32], [7, 13, 28], [1, 6]]By the way, for a more python style, this one is fine too:c3 = [ [i for i in set(f) if i in c1] for f in c2]I was also looking for a way to do it, and eventually it ended up like this:To define intersection that correctly takes into account the cardinality of the elements use Counter:We can use set methods for this:Here\'s one way to set c3 that doesn\'t involve sets:But if you prefer to use just one line, you can do this:It\'s a list comprehension inside a list comprehension, which is a little unusual, but I think you shouldn\'t have too much trouble following it.
