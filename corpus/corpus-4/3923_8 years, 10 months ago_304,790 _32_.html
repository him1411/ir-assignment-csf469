How do I learn where the source file for a given Python module is installed? Is the method different on Windows than on Linux?I\'m trying to look for the source of the datetime module in particular, but I\'m interested in a more general answer as well.For a pure python module you can find the source by looking at themodule.__file__.\nThe datetime module, however, is written in C, and therefore datetime.__file__ points to a .so file (there is no datetime.__file__ on Windows), and therefore, you can\'t see the source.If you download a python source tarball and extract it, the modules\' code can be found in the Modules subdirectory.For example, if you want to find the datetime code for python 2.6, you can look atYou can also find the latest Mercurial version on the web at \nhttps://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Modules/_datetimemodule.cRunning python -v from the command line should tell you what is being imported and from where.  This works for me on Windows and Mac OS X.I\'m not sure what those bad mtime\'s are on my install!I realize this answer is 4 years late, but the existing answers are misleading people.The right way to do this is never __file__, or trying to walk through sys.path and search for yourself, etc. (unless you need to be backward compatible beyond 2.1).It\'s the inspect module\xe2\x80\x94in particular, getfile or getsourcefile.Unless you want to learn and implement the rules (which are documented, but painful, for CPython 2.x, and not documented at all for other implementations, or 3.x) for mapping .pyc to .py files; dealing with .zip archives, eggs, and module packages; trying different ways to get the path to .so/.pyd files that don\'t support __file__; figuring out what Jython/IronPython/PyPy do; etc. In which case, go for it.Meanwhile, every Python version\'s source from 2.0+ is available online at http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/X.Y/ (e.g., 2.7 or 3.3). So, once you discover that inspect.getfile(datetime) is a .so or .pyd file like /usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/datetime.so, you can look it up inside the Modules directory. Strictly speaking, there\'s no way to be sure of which file defines which module, but nearly all of them are either foo.c or foomodule.c, so it shouldn\'t be hard to guess that datetimemodule.c is what you want.The sys.path list contains the list of directories which will be searched for modules at runtime:datetime is a builtin module, so there is no (Python) source file.For modules coming from .py (or .pyc) files, you can use mymodule.__file__, e.g.from the standard library try imp.find_moduleIf you\'re using pip to install your modules, just pip show $module the location is returned.New in Python 3.2, you can now use e.g. code_info() from the dis module:\nhttp://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.2.html#disIn the python interpreter you could import the particular module and then type help(module). This gives details such as Name, File, Module Docs, Description et al.Ex:et alCheck out this nifty "cdp" command to cd to the directory containing the source for the indicated Python module:Here\'s a one-liner to get the filename for a module, suitable for shell aliasing:Set up as an alias:To use:On windows you can find the location of the python module as shown below:i.e find rest_framework module\nNot all python modules are written in python. Datetime happens to be one of them that is not, and (on linux) is datetime.so.You would have to download the source code to the python standard library to get at it.For those who prefer a GUI solution: if you\'re using a gui such as Spyder (part of the Anaconda installation) you can just right-click the module name (such as "csv" in "import csv") and select "go to definition" - this will open the file, but also on the top you can see the exact file location ("C:....csv.py") On Ubuntu 12.04, for example numpy package for python2, can be found at:Of course, this is not generic answer
