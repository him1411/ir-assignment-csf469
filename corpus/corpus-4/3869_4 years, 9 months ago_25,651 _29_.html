I have this code:Why does this not write "bar" into my text file, but alerts "42"?NB: Earlier revisions of this question were explicitly about PHP on the server and JavaScript on the client. The essential nature of the problem and solutions is the same for any pair of languages when one is running on the client and the other on the server. Please take this in to account when you see answers talking about specific languages.Your code is split into two entirely separate parts, the server side and the client side.The two sides communicate via HTTP requests and responses. PHP is executed on the server and outputs some HTML and maybe JavaScript code which is sent as response to the client where the HTML is interpreted and the JavaScript is executed. Once PHP has finished outputting the response, the script ends and nothing will happen on the server until a new HTTP request comes in.The example code executes like this:Step 1, PHP executes all code between <?php ?> tags. The result is this:The file_put_contents call did not result in anything, it just wrote " + foo + " into a file. The <?php echo 42; ?> call resulted in the output "42", which is now in the spot where that code used to be.This resulting HTML/JavaScript code is now sent to the client, where it gets evaluated. The alert call works, while the foo variable is not used anywhere.All PHP code is executed on the server before the client even starts executing any of the JavaScript. There\'s no PHP code left in the response that JavaScript could interact with.To call some PHP code, the client will have to send a new HTTP request to the server. This can happen using one of three possible methods:Here\'s a question outlining these method in greater detailYou can also use JavaScript to make the browser open a new page using window.location or submit a form, emulating possibilities 1. and 2.To determine why PHP code doesn\'t work in JavaScript code we need to understand what is client side and server side language and how they work. Server-side languages (PHP etc.):  They retrieve records from databases, maintain state over the stateless HTTP connection, and do a lot of things that require  security. They reside on the server, these programs never have their source code exposed to the user                               \n  image attrSo you can easily see that server side language handle HTTP request and process it and as @deceze said  PHP is executed on the server and outputs some HTML and maybe JavaScript code which is sent as response to the client where the HTML is interpreted and the JavaScript is executed.While at the other hand Client Side Language (like JavaScript) resides on browser and runs at the browser, Client-side scripting generally refers to the class of computer programs on the web that are executed client-side, by the user\'s web browser, instead of server-side.JavaScript is visible to the user and can be easily modified so for security stuff we must not rely on JavaScript. So when you make a HTTP request on server than  The server first reads the PHP file carefully to see if there are any tasks that need to be executed and send response to client side and again as @deceze said *Once PHP has finished outputting the response, the script ends and nothing will happen on the server until a new HTTP request comes in.*Image source  So now what can I do if I need to call PHP? It depends how you need to do it: either by reloading the page or by using an AJAX call.Good Read:Your Javascript will execute on the client, not on the server. This means that foo is not evaluated on the server side and therefore its value can\'t be written to a file on the server.The best way to think about this process is as if you\'re generating a text file dynamically. The text you\'re generating only becomes executable code once the browser interprets it. Only what you place between <?php tags is evaluated on the server.By the way, making a habit of embedding random pieces of PHP logic in HTML or Javascript can lead to seriously convoluted code. I speak from painful experience.In web application every task execute in a manner of request and response.Client side programming is with html code  with Java script and its frameworks, libraries executes in the internet explorer, Mozilla, chrome browsers.\nIn the java scenario\nserver side programming servlets executes in the Tomcat, web-logic , j boss, WebSphere severs
