If class B and class C extend class A and I have an object of type B or C, how can I determine which it instantiates?Use Object.getClass().  It returns the runtime type of the object.Multiple right answers were presented, but there are still more methods: Class.isAssignableFrom() and simply attempting to cast the object (which might throw a ClassCastException).I summarize the possible ways to test if an object obj is an instance of type C:There is a difference in null handling though:To remember: null is not an instance of any type but it can be cast to any type.You can use:HTH. But I think most of the time it is no good practice to use that for control flow or something similar...Any use of any of the methods suggested is considered a code smell which is based in a bad OO design.If your design is good, you should not find yourself needing to use getClass() or instanceof.Any of the suggested methods will do, but just something to keep in mind, design-wise.There is also an .isInstance method on the "Class" class. if you get an object\'s class via myBanana.getClass() you can see if your object myApple is an instance of the same class as myBanana viaWe can use reflection in this caseExample:-In this case you will get name of the class which object pass to HttpServletRequest interface refference variable.
