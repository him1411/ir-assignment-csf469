I\'d like to use JavaScript to calculate the width of a string. Is this possible without having to use a monospace typeface?If it\'s not built-in, my only idea is to create a table of widths for each character, but this is pretty unreasonable especially supporting Unicode and different type sizes (and all browsers for that matter).Create a DIV styled with the following styles. In your JavaScript, set the font size and attributes that you are trying to measure, put your string in the DIV, then read the current width and height of the DIV. It will stretch to fit the contents and the size will be within a few pixels of the string rendered size.HTML:CSS:JavaScript (fragment):In HTML 5, you can just use the Canvas.measureText method (further explanation here).Try this fiddle:This fiddle compares this Canvas method to a variation of Bob Monteverde\'s DOM-based method, so you can analyze and compare accuracy of the results.There are several advantages to this approach, including:NOTE: When you add the text to your DOM, remember to also take account of padding, margin and border.NOTE 2: On some browsers, this method yields sub-pixel accuracy (result is a floating point number), on others it does not (result is only an int). You might want to run Math.floor on (and possibly add 1 to) the result, to avoid inconsistencies. Since the DOM-based method is never sub-pixel accurate, this method has even higher precision than the other methods here.According to this jsperf (thanks to the contributors in comments), the Canvas method and the DOM-based method are about equally fast, if caching is added to the DOM-based method and you are not using Firefox. In Firefox, for some reason, this Canvas method is much much faster than the DOM-based method (as of September 2014).Here\'s one I whipped together without example. It looks like we are all on the same page.Using it is simple: "a string".width()**Added white-space: nowrap so strings with width larger than the window width can be calculated.jQuery:This works for me...The ExtJS javascript library has a great class called Ext.util.TextMetrics that "provides precise pixel measurements for blocks of text so that you can determine exactly how high and wide, in pixels, a given block of text will be".  You can either use it directly or view its source to code to see how this is done.http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.util.TextMetricsI wrote a little tool for that. Perhaps it\'s useful to somebody. It works without jQuery.https://github.com/schickling/calculate-sizeUsage:Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/PEvL8/You can use the canvas so you don\'t have to deal so much with css properties:This should work as long as the <span> tag has no other styles applied to it.\noffsetWidth will include the width of any borders, horizontal padding, vertical scrollbar width, etc. The code-snips below, "calculate" the width of the span-tag, appends "..." to it if its too long and reduces the text-length, until it fits in its parent (or until it has tried more than a thousand times)CSSHTMLJavaScript (with jQuery)Try this code:The width and heigth of a text can be obtained with clientWidth and clientHeightmake sure that style position property is set to absolutenot required to be inside a div, can be inside a p or a spanThe better of is to detect whether text will fits right before you display the element. So you can use this function which doesn\'t requires the element to be on screen.Usage:Fiddle of working example: http://jsfiddle.net/tdpLdqpo/1/HTML:JavaScript code:Building off of Deepak Nadar\'s answer, I changed the functions parameter\'s to accept text and font styles. You do not need to reference an element. Also, the fontOptions have defaults, so you to not need to supply all of them.I guess this is prety similar to Depak entry, but is based on the work of Louis Lazaris published at an article in impressivewebs pageThe fit event is used to execute the function call inmediatly after the function is asociated to the control.e.g.: $(\'input\').autofit().trigger("fit");Without jQuery:
