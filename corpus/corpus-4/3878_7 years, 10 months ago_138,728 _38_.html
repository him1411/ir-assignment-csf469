I have an old branch, which I would like to delete. However, before doing so, I want to check that all commits made to this branch were at some point merged into some other branch. Thus, I\'d like to see all commits made to my current branch which have not been applied to any other branch [or, if this is not possible without some scripting, how does one see all commits in one branch which have not been applied to another given branch?].You probably just wantThis will list all branches which contain the commits from "branch-to-delete".\nIf it reports more than just "branch-to-delete", the branch has been merged.Your alternatives are really just rev-list syntax things.  e.g.  git log one-branch..another-branch shows everything that one-branch needs to have everything another-branch has.You may also be interested in git show-branch as a way to see what\'s where.To see a list of which commits are on one branch but not another, use git log:...that is, show commit logs for all commits on oldbranch that are not on newbranch.  You can list multiple branches to include and exclude, e.g.Note: on Windows ^ is an escape key, so it needs to be escaped with another ^: While some of the answers posted here will help find what you seek, the following sub-command of git branch is a more suitable solution for your task.  --merged is used to find all branches which can be safely deleted, since those branches are fully contained by HEAD.While in master one could run the command to enumerate the branches one could safely remove, like so:To show the commits in oldbranch but not in newbranch:To show the diff by these commits (note there are three dots):Here is the doc with a diagram illustration https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection#Commit-RangesFor those still looking for a simple answer, check out git cherry. It compares actual diffs instead of commit hashes. That means it accommodates commits that have been cherry picked or rebased.First checkout the branch you want to delete: git checkout [branch-to-delete]then use git cherry to compare it to your main development branch:git cherry -v masterExample output:Note: The -v flag is to include the commit message along with the SHA hash.Lines with the \'+\' in front are in the branch-to-delete, but not the master branch. Those with a \'-\' in front have an equivalent commit in master.For JUST the commits that aren\'t in master, combine cherry pick with grep:git cherry -v master | grep "^\\+"Example output:jimmyorr\'s answer does not work on Windows. it helps to use --not instead of ^ like so:If it is one (single) branch that you need to check, for example if you want that branch \'B\' is fully merged into branch \'A\', you can simply do the following:git branch -d <branchname> has the safety that "The branch must be fully merged in HEAD."Note that this actually delete the branch if it is merged in,You can use this simple script to see commits that are not mergedYou can use also tool git-wtf that will display state of branchesTo list missing commits between two branches you may use compare-branches.pyhttps://bitbucket.org/aakef/compare-git-branchesCreate a Pull Request via the git hosting service you\'re using. If the branch has been fully merged into the base branch, you\'ll be unable to create the new PR.For example, on GitHub:There isn\'t anything to compareThis doesn\'t use git on the command line, but I often find it\'s helpful to use the other tools at your disposal with a clear mental model rather than attempt to remember another arcane git command.
