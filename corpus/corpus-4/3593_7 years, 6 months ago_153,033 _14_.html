I\'m looking at the MDC page for the @font-face CSS rule, but I don\'t get one thing. I have separate files for bold, italic and bold + italic. How can I embed all three files in one @font-face rule? For example, if I have:The browser will not know what font to use for bold (because that file is DejaVuSansBold.ttf), so it will default to something I probably don\'t want. How can I tell the browser all the different variants I have for a certain font?The solution seems to be to add multiple @font-face rules, for example:By the way, it would seem Google Chrome doesn\'t know about the format("ttf") argument, so you might want to skip that.(This answer was correct for the CSSÂ 2 specification. CSS3 only allows for one font-style rather than a comma-separated list.)As of CSS3, the spec has changed, allowing for only a single font-style. A comma-separated list (per CSS2) will be treated as if it were normal and override any earlier (default) entry. This will make fonts defined in this way appear italic permanently.In most cases, italic will probably be sufficient and oblique rules won\'t be necessary if you take care to define whichever you will use and stick to it.If you are using Google fonts I would suggest the following.If you want the fonts to run from your localhost or server you need to download the files.Instead of downloading the ttf packages in the download links, use the live link they provide, for example:Paste the URL in your browser and you should get a font-face declaration similar to the first answer.Open the URLs provided, download and rename the files.Stick the updated font-face declarations with relative paths to the woff files in your CSS, and you are done.To have font variation working correctly, I had to reverse the order of @font-face in CSS.
