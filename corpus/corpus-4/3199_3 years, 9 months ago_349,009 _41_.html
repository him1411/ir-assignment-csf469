I\'m working on a web page, and I want custom-styled <button> tags. So with CSS, I said: border: none. Now it works perfectly in safari, but in chrome, when I click one of the buttons, it puts an annoying blue border around it. I thought button:active { outline: none } or button:focus { outline:none } would work, but neither do. Any ideas? This is what it looks like before being clicked (and how I want it to still look after being clicked):And this is the border I\'m talking about:Here is my CSS:Just add this to your css:Check it out or JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/u4pXu/Or in this snippet:Wait! There\'s a reason for that ugly outline!Before removing that ugly blue outline, you may want to take accessibility into consideration. By default, that blue outline is placed on focusable elements. This is so that users with accessibility issues are able to focus that button by tabbing to it. Some users do not have the motor skills to use a mouse and must use only the keyboard (or some other input device) for computer interaction. When you remove the blue outline, there is no longer a visual indicator on what element is focused. If you are going to remove the blue outline, you should replace it with another type of visual indication that the button is focused.Possible Solution: Darken Buttons when focusedFor the examples below, Chrome\'s blue outline was first removed by using button:focus { outline:0 !important; }Here are your basic Bootstrap buttons as they appear normally:\nHere are the buttons when they receive focus:\nHere the buttons when they are pressed:\nAs you can see, the buttons are a little darker when they receive focus. Personally, I would recommend making the focused buttons even darker so that there is a very noticeable difference between the focused state and the normal state of the button.It\'s not just for disabled usersMaking your site more accessible is something that is often overlooked but can help create a more productive experience in your website. There are many normal users that use keyboard commands to navigate through websites in order to keep hands on the keyboard.Don\'t forget the !important declaration, for a better resultA rule that has the !important property will always be applied no matter where that rule appears in the CSS document.I just remove the outline from all the tags in the page by selecting all and applying outline:none to everything:)As bagofcole mentioned, you might need to add !important as well, so the style will look like this:Add this in your CSS file.In my instance of this problem I had to specify box-shadow: noneUse either this:or this if that doesn\'t work: This works for me (FF and Chrome, at least). Instead of targeting the :focus state, just target the :active state and that will remove the aesthetically obtrusive highlighting in your browser when a user clicks a link. But it will still retain the focus states when a user with disabilities tabs or shift-tabs through a page. Both parties are happy. :)This is what worked for me:For anyone using Bootstrap and having this problem, they use :active:focus as well as just :active and :focus so you\'ll need:Hopefully saved someone some time figuring that one out, banged my head for bit wondering why such a simple thing wasn\'t working.try this code for all element which have blue border problemorfor this problem:use this:result:If you want to delete same effect in input, you could do add the following code as well as button.input:focus {outline:0;}
