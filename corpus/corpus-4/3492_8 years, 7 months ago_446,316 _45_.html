I am trying to use a java.util.Date as input and then creating a query with it - so I need a java.sql.Date.  I was surprised to find that it couldn\'t do the conversion implicitly or explicitly - but I don\'t even know how I would do this, as the Java API is still fairly new to me.If you are trying to work with date-only values (no time-of-day, no time zone), use the LocalDate class rather than java.util.Date.In Java 8 and later, the troublesome old date-time classes bundled with early versions of Java have been supplanted by the new java.time package. See Oracle Tutorial. Much of the functionality has been back-ported to Java 6 & 7 in ThreeTen-Backport and further adapted to Android in ThreeTenABP.A SQL data type DATE is meant to be date-only, with no time-of-day and no time zone. Java never had precisely such a class\xe2\x80\xa0 until java.time.LocalDate in Java 8. Let\'s create such a value by getting today\'s date according to a particular time zone (time zone is important in determining a date as a new day dawns earlier in Paris than in Montr\xc3\xa9al, for example).At this point, we may be done. If your JDBC driver complies with JDBC 4.2 spec, you should be able to pass a LocalDate via setObject on a PreparedStatement to store into a SQL DATE field. Likewise, use ResultSet::getObject to fetch from a SQL DATE column to a Java LocalDate object. Specifying the class in the second argument makes your code type-safe.In other words, this entire Question is irrelevant under JDBC 4.2 or later.If your JDBC driver does not perform in this manner, you need to fall back to converting to the java.sql types.To convert, use new methods added to the old date-time classes. We can call java.sql.Date.valueOf(\xe2\x80\xa6) to convert a LocalDate.And going the other direction.While you should avoid using the old date-time classes, you may be forced to when working with existing code. If so, you can convert to/from java.time. Go through the Instant class, which represents a moment on the timeline in UTC. An Instant is similar in idea to a java.util.Date. But note that Instant has a resolution up to nanoseconds while java.util.Date has only milliseconds resolution.To convert, use new methods added to the old classes. For example, java.util.Date.from( Instant ) and java.util.Date::toInstant.To determine a date, we need the context of a time zone. For any given moment, the date varies around the globe by time zone. Apply a ZoneId to get a ZonedDateTime.\xe2\x80\xa0 The java.sql.Date class pretends to be date-only without a time-of-day but actually does a time-of-day, adjusted to a midnight time. Confusing? Yes, the old date-time classes are a mess.Nevermind....explains it.  The link is http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0040__Data-Type/ConvertfromajavautilDateObjecttoajavasqlDateObject.htmWith the other answer you may have troubles with the time info (compare the dates with unexpected results!)I suggest:This function will return a converted SQL date from java date object.Converting java.util.Data to java.sql.Data will lost the hour,minute and second. So if it is possible, I suggest you use java.sql.Timestamp like this:For more info, you can check this question.In my case of picking date from JXDatePicker (java calender) and getting it stored in database as SQL Date type, below works fine ..java.sql.Date date = new java.sql.Date(pickedDate.getDate().getTime());where pickedDate is object of JXDatePickerThis function will return a converted SQL date from java date object.Here the example of converting Util Date to Sql date and ya this is one example what i am using in my project might be helpful to you too.Format your java.util.Date first. Then use the formatted date to get the date in java.sql.DateMethod for comparing 2 dates (util.date or sql.date)  try with this I think the best way to convert is:If you want to insert the dt variable into an SQL table you can do:I am a novice: after much running around this worked.  Thought might be usefulYou can use this method to convert util date to sql date,I was trying the following coding that worked fine.java.util.Date utilDate = new java.util.Date(); java.sql.Date\n  sqlDate = new java.sql.Date(utilDate);i am using the following code please try it outspecify the format of the date you want\nfor example "DD-MM_YYYY" or \'YYYY-mm-dd\'  then use the java Date datatype asthen it will parse your dateIf you are usgin Mysql a date column can be passed a String representation of this dateso i using the DateFormatter Class to format it and then set it as a String in the sql statement or prepared statementhere is the code illustration:String date = converUtilDateToSqlDate(otherTransaction.getTransDate());//then pass this date in you sql statement
