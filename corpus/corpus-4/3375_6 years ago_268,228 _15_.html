Possible Duplicate: \n  What does “javascript:void(0)” mean?Reading through the Backbone.js source code, I saw this:What is void 0? What is the purpose of using it here?void[MDN] is a prefix keyword that takes one argument and always returns undefined.ExamplesIt seems pretty useless, doesn\'t it? If it always returns undefined, what\'s wrong with just using undefined itself?In a perfect world we would be able to safely just use undefined: it\'s much simpler and easier to understand than void 0. But in case you\'ve never noticed before, this isn\'t a perfect world, especially when it comes to Javascript. The problem with using undefined was that undefined is not a reserved word (it is actually a property of the global object [wtfjs]). That is, undefined is a permissible variable name, so you could assign a new value to it at your own caprice.Note: This is no longer a problem in any environment that supports ECMAScript 5 or newer (i.e. in practice everywhere but IE 8), which defines the undefined property of the global object as read-only (so it is only possible to shadow the variable in your own local scope). However, this information is still useful for backwards-compatibility purposes.void, on the other hand, cannot be overidden. void 0 will always return undefined. undefined, on the other hand, can be whatever Mr. Javascript decides he wants it to be.Why should we use void 0? What\'s so special about 0? Couldn\'t we just as easily use 1, or 42, or 1000000 or "Hello, world!"?And the answer is, yes, we could, and it would work just as well. The only benefit of passing in 0 instead of some other argument is that 0 is short and idiomatic.Although undefined can generally be trusted in modern JavaScript environments, there is one trivial advantage of void 0: it\'s shorter. The difference is not enough to worry about when writing code but it can add up enough over large code bases that most code minifiers replace undefined with void 0 to reduce the number of bytes sent to the browser.void 0 returns undefined and can not be overwritten while undefined can be overwritten. void is a reserved JavaScript keyword. It evaluates the expression and always returns undefined.
