I\'m wondering if there is a command line utility for taking a GitHub flavored Markdown file and rendering it to HTML.I\'m using a GitHub wiki to create website content. I\'ve cloned the repository on my server and would then like to process it into regular HTML. It\'s important to me that what appears on GitHub is exactly how it should look for my website. I\'d also really like to use the fenced blocks with ~~~, so I\'d rather not use standard Markdown syntax only.I\'ve looked a bit into the JavaScript live preview thinking I could hook it into Node.js, but they say it is deprecated. I\'ve looked at the redcarpet repository, but it doesn\'t look like it has a command line interface.I rolled my own solution, however, since no solution here is clearly better than the others, I\'ll leave the question without a selected answer.I wrote a small CLI in Python and added GFM support. It\'s called Grip (Github Readme Instant Preview).Install it with:And to use it, simply:Then visit localhost:5000 to view the readme.md file at that location.You can also specify your own file:And change port:And of course, specifically render GitHub-Flavored Markdown, optionally with repository context:Notable features:Hope this helps someone here. Check it out.I\'ve not found a quick and easy method for GitHub-flavoured Markdown, but I have found a slightly more generic version - Pandoc. It converts from/to a number of formats, including Markdown, Rest, HTML and others.I\'ve also developed a Makefile to convert all .md files to .html (in large part to the example at Writing, Markdown and Pandoc):Maybe this might help:No documentation exists, but I got it from the gollum documentation. Looking at rubydoc.info, it looks like you can use:in your Ruby code. You can wrap that easily in a script to turn it into a command line utility:Execute it with ./render.rb path/to/my/markdown/file.md. Note that this is not safe for use in production without sanitization.It doesn\'t handle GitHub extensions, but it is better than nothing. I believe you can extend the module to handle the GitHub additions.Probably not what you want, but since you mentioned Node.js: I could not find a good tool to preview GitHub Flavored Markdown documentation on my local drive before committing them to GitHub, so today I created one, based on Node.js: https://github.com/ypocat/gfmsSo perhaps you can reuse the showdown.js from it for your Wiki, if your question is still actual. If not, maybe other people facing the same problem as I did will find (just as I did) this question and this answer to it.Use marked. It supports GitHub Flavored Markdown, can be used as a Node.js module and from the command line.An example would be:GitHub has a Markdown API you can use.To read a README.md file in the terminal I use:Pandoc outputs it in HTML format, which Lynx renders in your terminal.It works great: It fills my terminal, shortcuts are shown below, I can scroll through, and the links work!\nThere is only one font size though, but the colors + indentation + alignment make up for that.Installation:I created a tool similar to atom\'s preview functionality, but as a standalone application. Not sure if this is what you\'re looking for, but it might be helpful. -- https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/vmdThis is mostly a follow-on to @barry-staes\'s answer for using Pandoc. Homebrew has it as well, if you\'re on a Mac:Pandoc supports GFM as an input format via the markdown_github name.Output to fileOpen in LynxOpen in the default browser on OS XTextMate IntegrationYou can always pipe the current selection or current document to one of the above, as most editors allow you to do. You can also easily configure the environment so that pandoc replaces the default Markdown processor used by the Markdown bundle.First, create a shell script with the following contents (I\'ll call it ghmarkdown):You can then set the TM_MARKDOWN variable (in Preferences\xe2\x86\x92Variables) to /path/to/ghmarkdown, and it will replace the default Markdown processor.pandoc with browser works well for me.Usage: cat README.md | pandoc -f markdown_github | browserInstallation (Assuming you are using Mac OSX):$ brew install pandoc$ brew install browserOr on Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install pandoc browserAlso see https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/128721/24257.If you\'re interested in how we [Github] render Markdown files, you might want to check out Redcarpet, our Ruby interface to the Sundown library.Ruby-script, which use Redcarpet, will be "command line utility", if you\'ll have local RubyMy final solution was to use Python Markdown. I rolled my own extension that fixed the fence blocks.There is a really nice and simple tool for browsing GFM Markdown documents:GFMS - Github Flavored Markdown ServerIt\'s simple and lightweight (no configuration needed) HTTP server you can start in any directory containing markdown files to browse them.Features:GitHub has (since) developed a nice modular text editor called Atom (based on Chromium and uses Node.js modules for packages).A default preinstalled package Markdown Preview lets you display your preview in a separate tab using Ctrl + Shift + M.I haven\'t tested its full syntax, but since it\'s coming from GitHub, I\'d be highly surprised if the preview\'s syntax was different from theirs (fenced blocks using ~~~ work).Now, while it\'s not technically command-line based, it uses Node.js and outputs to a DOM-based renderer, which might help anyone trying to render GitHub syntax-based HTML on a Node.js-based webserver, or just edit her/his README.md offline.Improving upon @barry-stae\'s solution. Stick this snippet in ~/.bashrcThen we can quickly view the file from the command-line. Also works nicely over SSH/Telnet sessions.I found a website that will do this for you: http://tmpvar.com/markdown.html. Paste in your Markdown, and it\'ll display it for you. It seems to work just fine!However, it doesn\'t seem to handle the syntax highlighting option for code; that is, the ~~~ruby feature doesn\'t work. It just prints \'ruby\'.Late addition but showdownjs has a CLI tool you can use to parse MD to HTML.Improving upon @barry-stae and @Sandeep answers for regular users of elinks you would add the following to .bashrc:Don\'t forget to install pandoc (and elinks).Based on Jim Lim\'s answer, I installed the GitHub Markdown gem. That included a script called gfm that takes a filename on the command line and writes the equivalent HTML to standard output. I modified that slightly to save the file to disk and then to open the standard browser with launchy:A \'quick-and-dirty\' approach is to download the wiki HTML pages using the wget utility, instead of cloning it. For example, this is how I downloaded the Hystrix wiki from GitHub (I\'m using Ubuntu Linux):The first call will download the wiki entry page and all its dependencies. The second one will call all sub-pages on it. You can browse now the wiki by opening Netflix/Hystrix/wiki.1.html.Note that both calls to wget are necessary. If you just run the second one then you will miss some dependencies required to show the pages properly.I managed to use a one-line Ruby script for that purpose (although it had to go in a separate file). First, run these commands once on each client machine you\'ll be pushing docs from:\n\n gem install github-markup\n gem install commonmarker\n\nNext, install this script in your client image, and call it render-readme-for-javadoc.rb:```\n require \'github/markup\'puts GitHub::Markup.render_s(GitHub::Markups::MARKUP_MARKDOWN, File.read(\'README.md\'))\n```Finally, invoke it like this:\nruby ./render-readme-for-javadoc.rb >> project/src/main/javadoc/overview.html\nETA: This won\'t help you with StackOverflow-flavor Markdown, which seems to be failing on this answer.I recently made what you want, because I was in need to generate documentation from Markdown files and the GitHub style is pretty nice. Try it. It is written in Node.js.gfm
