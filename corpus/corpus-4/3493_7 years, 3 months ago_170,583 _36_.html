I have a long ListView that the user can scroll around before returning to the previous screen. When the user opens this ListView again, I want the list to be scrolled to the same point that it was previously. Any ideas on how to achieve this?Try this:Explanation:\nListView.getFirstVisiblePosition() returns the top visible list item. But this item may be partially scrolled out of view, and if you want to restore the exact scroll position of the list you need to get this offset. So ListView.getChildAt(0) returns the View for the top list item, and then View.getTop() - mList.getPaddingTop() returns its relative offset from the top of the ListView. Then, to restore the ListView\'s scroll position, we call ListView.setSelectionFromTop() with the index of the item we want and an offset to position its top edge from the top of the ListView.I adopted the solution suggested by @(Kirk Woll), and it works for me. I have also seen in the Android source code for the "Contacts" app, that they use a similar technique. I would like to add some more details:\nOn top on my ListActivity-derived class:Then, some method overrides:Of course "loadData" is my function to retrieve data from the DB and put it onto the list.On my Froyo device, this works both when you change the phone orientation, and when you edit an item and go back to the list.A very simple way:The method setSelection will reset the list to the supplied item. If not in touch mode the item will actually be selected if in touch mode the item will only be positioned on screen.A more complicated approach:I found something interesting about this.I tried setSelection and scrolltoXY but it did not work at all, the list remained in the same position, after some trial and error I got the following code that does workIf instead of posting the Runnable you try runOnUiThread it does not work either (at least on some devices)This is a very strange workaround for something that should be straight forward.CAUTION!! There is a bug in AbsListView that doesn\'t allow the onSaveState() to work correctly if the ListView.getFirstVisiblePosition() is 0. So If you have large images that take up most of the screen, and you scroll to the second image, but a little of the first is showing, the scroll position Won\'t be saved... from AbsListView.java:1650 (comments mine)But in this situation, the \'top\' in the code below will be a negative number which causes other issues that prevent the state to be restored correctly. So when the \'top\' is negative, get the next childThat\'s enoughFor some looking for a solution to this problem, the root of the issue may be where you are setting your list views adapter. After you set the adapter on the listview, it resets the scroll position. Just something to consider. I moved setting the adapter into my onCreateView after we grab the reference to the listview, and it solved the problem for me. =)Isn\'t simply android:saveEnabled="true" in the ListView xml declaration enough?Am posting this because I am surprised nobody had mentioned this.After user clicks the back button he will return to the listview in the same state as he went out of it. This code will override the "up" button to behave the same way as the back button so in the case of Listview -> Details -> Back to Listview (and no other options) this is the simplest code to maintain the scrollposition and the content in the listview.Caution: If you can go to another activity from the details activity the up button will return you back to that activity so you will have to manipulate the backbutton history in order for this to work. If you\'re using fragments hosted on an activity you can do something like this:If you are saving/restoring scroll position of ListView yourself you are essentially duplicating the functionality already implemented in android framework. The ListView restores fine scroll position just well on its own except one caveat: as @aaronvargas mentioned there is a bug in AbsListView that won\'t let to restore fine scroll position for the first list item. Nevertheless the best way to restore scroll position is not to restore it. Android framework will do it better for you. Just make sure you have met the following conditions:.To avoid aforementioned caveat with first list item you can craft your adapter the way it returns special dummy zero pixels height view for the ListView at position 0.\nHere is the simple example project shows ListView and ExpandableListView restore their fine scroll positions whereas their scroll positions are not explicitly saved/restored. Fine scroll position is restored perfectly even for the complex scenarios with temporary switching to some other application, double screen rotation and switching back to the test application. Please note, if you are explicitly exiting the application (by pressing the Back button) the scroll position won\'t be saved (as well as all other Views won\'t save their state).\nhttps://github.com/voromto/RestoreScrollPosition/releasesBEST SOLUTION IS:YOU MUST CALL IN POST AND IN THREAD!For an activity derived from ListActivity that implements LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks using a SimpleCursorAdapter it did not work to restore the position in onReset(), because the activity was almost always restarted and the adapter was reloaded when the details view was closed. The trick was to restore the position in onLoadFinished():in onListItemClick():in onLoadFinished():in onBackPressed():You can maintain the scroll state after a reload if you save the state before you reload and restore it after. In my case I made a asynchronous network request and reloaded the list in a callback after it completed. This is where I restore state. Code sample is Kotlin.
