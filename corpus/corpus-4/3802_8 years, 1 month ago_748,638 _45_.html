You can find lots of information at jquery.com, including documentation with examples.  For submitting a form normally, check out the submit() method to at that site.  For AJAX, there are many different possibilities, though you probably want to use either the ajax() or post() methods.

So you have to acces the HTML Element itself (unwrap from jQquery) and call submit() on this element directly:You can also use the jquery form plugin to submit using ajax aswell:http://malsup.com/jquery/form/See events/submit.Note that in Internet Explorer there are issues with dynamically created forms.
