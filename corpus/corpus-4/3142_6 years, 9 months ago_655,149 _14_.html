Can you help me with SQL statements to find duplicates on multiple fields?For example, in pseudo code:and from the above statement if there are multiple occurrences I would like to select every record except the first one.To get the list of fields for which there are multiple records, you can use..Check this link for more information on how to delete the rows.http://support.microsoft.com/kb/139444Edit : As the other users mentioned, there should be a criterion for deciding how you define "first rows" before you use the approach in the link above. Based on that you\'ll need to use an order by clause and a sub query if needed. If you can post some sample data, it would really help.You mention "the first one", so I assume that you have some kind of ordering on your data. Let\'s assume that your data is ordered by some field ID.This SQL should get you the duplicate entries except for the first one. It basically selects all rows for which another row with (a) the same fields and (b) a lower ID exists. Performance won\'t be great, but it might solve your problem.This is a fun solution with SQL Server 2005 that I like.  I\'m going to assume that by "for every record except for the first one", you mean that there is another "id" column that we can use to identify which row is "first".To see duplicate valueIf you\'re using SQL Server 2005 or later (and the tags for your question indicate SQL Server 2008), you can use ranking functions to return the duplicate records after the first one if using joins is less desirable or impractical for some reason.  The following example shows this in action, where it also works with null values in the columns examined.Notice after running this example that the first record out of every "group" is excluded, and that records with null values are handled properly.If you don\'t have a column available to order the records within a group, you can use the partition-by columns as the order-by columns.
