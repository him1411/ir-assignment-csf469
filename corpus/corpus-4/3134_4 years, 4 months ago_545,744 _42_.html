Is there any way to make an expression for something like ngClass to be a conditional. For example, I have tried the following:The issue with this code is that no matter what obj.value1 is, the class test is always applied to the element. Doing this:As long as obj.value2 does not equal a truthy value, the class in not applied.  Now I can work around the issue in the first example by doing this:where the checkValue1 function looks like this:I am just wondering if this is how ngClass is supposed to work.  I am also building a custom directive where I would like to do something similar to this. However I can\'t find a way to watch an expression (and maybe that is impossible and the reason why it works like this).Here is a plnkr to show what I mean:http://plnkr.co/edit/iSh0t8swDEyGbh7ylZg2?p=previewYour first attempt was almost right, It should work without the quotes.Here is a plnkr.The ngClass directive will work with any expression that evaluates truthy or falsey, a bit similar to Javascript expressions but with some differences, you can read about here.\nIf your conditional is too complex, then you can use a function that returns truthy or falsey, as you did in your third attempt.Just to complement: You can also use logical operators to form logical expressions like Using ng-class inside ng-repeatFor each status in task.status a different class is used for the row.Angular JS provide this functionality in ng-class Directive. In which you can put condition and also assign conditional class. You can achieve this in two different ways.In this code class will be apply according to value of status valueif status value is 0 then apply class oneif status value is 1 then apply class twoif status value is 2 then apply class threeIn which class will be apply by value of statusif status value is 1 or true then it will add class test_yesif status value is 0 or false then it will add class test_noI see great examples above but they all start with curly brackets (json map). Another option is to return a result based on computation. The result can also be a list of css class names (not just map). Example:orExplanation: If the status is active, the class enabled will be used. Otherwise, the class disabled will be used.The list [] is used for using multiple classes (not just one).angular syntax is to use the : operator to perform the equivalent of an if modifieradd clearfix class to even rows. nonetheless expression could be anything we can have in normal if condition and it should evaluate to either true or false.I am going to show you two methods by which you can dynamically apply ng-classBy using ternary operatorIf your condition is true then class1 will be applied to your element else class2 will be applied.When you will try to change the conditional value at run time the class somehow will not changed. So I will suggest you to go for step2 if you have requirement like dynamic class change.if your condition matches with value1 then class1 will be applied to your element, if matches with value2 then class2 will be applied and so on. And dynamic class change will work fine with it.Hope this will help you.There is a simple method which you could use with html class attribute and shorthand if/else. No need to make it so complex. Just use following method.Happy Coding,\nNimantha PereraUsing function with ng-class is a good option when someone has to run complex logic to decide the appropriate CSS class.http://jsfiddle.net/ms403Ly8/2/HTML:CSS:JavaScript: use thisfor example if the condition is [2 == 2], states are {true: \'...\', false: \'...\'}
