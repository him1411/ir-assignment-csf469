This question already has an answer here:What is the fastest way to check if an object is empty or not?Is there a faster and better way than this:I\'m assuming that by empty you mean "has no properties of its own".Examples:If you only need to handle ECMAScript5 browsers, you can use Object.getOwnPropertyNames instead of the hasOwnProperty loop:This will ensure that even if the object only has non-enumerable properties isEmpty will still give you the correct results.For ECMAScript5 (not supported in all browsers yet though), you can use:Easy and cross-browser way is by using jQuery.isEmptyObject:More: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isEmptyObject/You need jquery though.Underscore\'s isEmpty() is convenient, if you don\'t mind adding an extra library.Lets put this baby to bed; tested under Node, Chrome, Firefox and IE 9, it becomes evident that for most use cases:Bottom line performance wise, use:or     Results under Node: Testing for Object with 0 keys\n0.00018\n0.000015\n0.000015\n0.000324Testing for Object with 1 keys\n0.000346\n0.000458\n0.000577\n0.000657Testing for Object with 2 keys\n0.000375\n0.00046\n0.000565\n0.000773Testing for Object with 3 keys\n0.000406\n0.000476\n0.000577\n0.000904Testing for Object with 4 keys\n0.000435\n0.000487\n0.000589\n0.001031Testing for Object with 5 keys\n0.000465\n0.000501\n0.000604\n0.001148Testing for Object with 6 keys\n0.000492\n0.000511\n0.000618\n0.001269Testing for Object with 7 keys\n0.000528\n0.000527\n0.000637\n0.00138Testing for Object with 8 keys\n0.000565\n0.000538\n0.000647\n0.00159Testing for Object with 100 keys\n0.003718\n0.00243\n0.002535\n0.01381Testing for Object with 1000 keys\n0.0337\n0.0193\n0.0194\n0.1337Note that if your typical use case tests a non empty object with few keys, and rarely do you get to test empty objects or objects with 10 or more keys, consider the Object.keys(obj).length option. - otherwise go with the more generic (for... in...) implementation.Note that Firefox seem to have a faster support for Object.keys(obj).length and Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).length, making it a better choice for any non empty Object, but still when it comes to empty objects, the (for...in...) is simply 10 times faster.My 2 cents is that  Object.keys(obj).length is a poor idea since it creates an object of keys just to count how many keys are inside, than destroys it! In order to create that object he needs to loop overt the keys... so why use it and not the (for... in...) option :)Elegant way - use keyshttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keysSurprised to see so many weak answers on such a basic JS question... Top answer is no good too for these reasons:In fact there\'s a simpler solution:https://lodash.com/docs#isEmpty comes in pretty handy:How bad is this?You can use JSON.stringify(obj) then compare it to empty object. Like this:No need for a library.Here is a simple function that tests if object is empty (useful for Constraint violations check) from the todomvc src code.And here\'s an example from angular:And one from Ionic:It might be a bit hacky. You can try this.Not sure if there is any disadvantage of this method.fast onliner for \'dictionary\'-objects:You can write a fallback if Array.isArray and Object.getOwnPropertyNames is not availableImagine you have the objects below:Don\'t forget we can NOT use === sign for testing an object equality as they get  inheritance, so If you using ECMA 5 and upper version of javascript, the answer is easy, you can use the function below:so the result as below:I played a bit around and got this out:Got the inspiration from here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/laktek/758269#comment-784188here\'s a good way to do itMay be you can use this decision:I modified Sean Vieira\'s code to suit my needs. null and undefined don\'t count as object at all, and numbers, boolean values and empty strings return false. an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype.The Object.is() method determines whether two values are the same value.comparison of Objects:-http://jsfiddle.net/j7ona6hz/1/here my solutionChears
