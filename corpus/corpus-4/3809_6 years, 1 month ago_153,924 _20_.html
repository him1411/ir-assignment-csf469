I\'d like to unload a package without having to restart R (mostly because restarting R as I try out different, conflicting packages is getting frustrating, but conceivably this could be used in a program to use one function and then another--although namespace referencing is probably a better idea for that use).?library doesn\'t show any options that would unload a package.There is a suggestion that detach can unload package, but the following both fail:Error in detach(vegan) : invalid name argumentError in detach("vegan") : invalid name argumentSo how do I unload a package?Try this:It is possible to have multiple versions of a package loaded at once (for example, if you have a development version and a stable version in different libraries).  To detach guarantee that all copies are detached, use this function.Usage is, for exampleorYou can also use the unloadNamespace command, as in:The function detaches the namespace prior to unloading it.you can uncheck the check box button in RStudio (packages) I tried what kohske wrote as an answer and I got error again, so I did some search and found this which worked for me (R 3.0.2):or alsoWhen you are going back and forth between scripts it may only sometimes be necessary to unload a package. Here\'s a simple IF statement that will prevent warnings that would appear if you tried to unload a package that was not currently loaded.Including this at the top of a script might be helpful.I hope that makes your day!Just go to OUTPUT window. then click on Packages icon (it is located between Plot and Help icons). remove "tick / check mark" from the package you wanted be unload.for uoploud the package just put a "tick or Check mark" in front of package or use :\nlibrary (lme4)
