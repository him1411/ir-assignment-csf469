How to refresh an Android ListView after adding/deleting dynamic data?Call notifyDataSetChanged() on your Adapter object once you\'ve modified the data in that adapter. Some additional specifics on how/when to call notifyDataSetChanged() can be viewed in this Google I/O video.Also you can use this:enjoy!The right thing to do (and luckily also marked as right answer) is to call notifyDataSetChanged() on your Adapter.If calling notifyDataSetChanged() doesn\'t work all the layout methods won\'t help either. Believe me the ListView was properly updated. If you fail to find the difference you need to check where the data in your adapter comes from.If this is just a collection you\'re keeping in memory check that you actually deleted from or added the item(s) to the collection before calling the notifyDataSetChanged(). If you\'re working with a database or service backend you\'ll have to call the method to retrieve the information again (or manipulate the in memory data) before calling the notifyDataSetChanged().The thing is this notifyDataSetChanged only works if the dataset has changed. So that is the place to look if you don\'t find changes coming through. Debug if needed. I did find that working with an adapter that lets you manage the collection, like a BaseAdapter works better. Some adapters like the ArrayAdapter already manage their own collection making it harder to get to the proper collection for updates. It\'s really just an needless extra layer of difficulty in most cases.It is true that this has to be called from the UI thread. Other answers have examples on how to achieve this. However this is only required if you\'re working on this information from outside the UI thread. That is from a service or a non UI thread. In simple cases you\'ll be updating your data from a button click or another activity/fragment. So still within the UI thread. No need to always pop that runOnUiTrhead in.Can be found at https://github.com/hanscappelle/so-2250770.git. Just clone and open the project in Android Studio (gradle). This project has a MainAcitivity building a ListView with all random data. This list can be refreshed using the action menu. The adapter implementation I created for this example ModelObject exposes the data collectionCode from the MainActivity Another nice post about the power of listViews is found here: http://www.vogella.com/articles/AndroidListView/article.htmlCall runnable whenever you want:OnCreate(), you set your runnable thread:i got some problems with dynamic refresh of my listview.Call notifyDataSetChanged() on your Adapter.Some additional specifics on how/when to call notifyDataSetChanged() can be viewed in this Google I/O video.notifyDataSetChanged() did not work properly in my case[ I called the notifyDataSetChanged from another class]. Just in the case i edited the ListView in the running Activity (Thread). That video thanks to Christopher gave the final hint.In my second class i usedto acces the update() from my Activity. This update includesto tell the Adapter to refresh the view.\nWorked fine as far as I can say.If you are using SimpleCursorAdapter try calling requery() on the Cursor object.if you are not still satisfied with ListView Refreshment, you can look at this snippet,this is for loading the listView from DB, Actually what you have to do is simply reload the ListView,after you perform any CRUD Operation\nIts not a best way to code, but it  will refresh the ListView as you wish..It works for Me....if u find better solution,please Share...The solutions proposed by people in this post works or not mainly depending on the Android version of your device. For Example to use the AddAll method you have to put android:minSdkVersion="10" in your android device.To solve this questions for all devices I have created my on own method in my adapter and use inside the add and remove method inherits from ArrayAdapter that update you data without problems.My Code: Using my own data class RaceResult, you use your own data model.ResultGpRowAdapter.javaResultsGp.javaIf you want to maintain your scroll position when you refresh, and you can do this:For the detail information, please see Android ListView: Maintain your scroll position when you refresh.After deleting data from list view, you have to call refreshDrawableState().\nHere is the example:and deleteContact method in DatabaseHelper class will be somewhat looks like I was not able to get notifyDataSetChanged() to work on updating my SimpleAdapter, so instead I tried first removing all views that were attached to the parent layout using removeAllViews(), then adding the ListView, and that worked, allowing me to update the UI:For me after changing information in sql database nothing could refresh list view( to be specific expandable list view) so if notifyDataSetChanged() doesn\'t help, you can try to clear your list first and add it again after that call notifyDataSetChanged(). For exampleHope it makes sense for you.while using  SimpleCursorAdapter can call changeCursor(newCursor) on the adapter.I was the same when, in a fragment, I wanted to populate a ListView (in a single TextView) with the mac address of BLE devices scanned over some time.What I did was this: Then the ListView began to dynamically populate with the mac address of the devices found.I think it depends on what you mean by refresh.  Do you mean that the GUI display should be refreshed, or do you mean that the child views should be refreshed such that you can programatically call getChildAt(int) and get the view corresponding to what is in the Adapter.If you want the GUI display refreshed, then call notifyDataSetChanged() on the adapter.  The GUI will be refreshed when next redrawn.If you want to be able to call getChildAt(int) and get a view that reflects what is what is in the adapter, then call to layoutChildren().  This will cause the child view to be reconstructed from the adapter data.I had an ArrayList which I wanted to display in a listview. ArrayList contained elements from mysql. \nI overrided onRefresh method and in that method I used tablelayout.removeAllViews(); and then repeated the process for getting data again from the database.\nBut before that make sure to clear your ArrayList or whatever data structre or else new data will get appended to the old one..If you want to update the UI listview from a service, then make the adapter static in your Main activity and do this: You need to use a single object of that list whoose data you are inflating on list view .If refference is change The notifyDataSetChanged() does\'t work .Whenever You are deleting elements from list view also delete them from the list you sre using whether it is a ArrayList<> or Something else then Call \nnotifyDataSetChanged() on object of Your adapter class.So here see how i managed it in my adapter see below}If you are going by android guide lines and you are using the ContentProviders to get data from Database and you are displaying it in the ListView using the CursorLoader and CursorAdapters ,then you all changes to the related data will automatically be reflected in the ListView.Your getContext().getContentResolver().notifyChange(uri, null); on the cursor in the ContentProvider will be enough to reflect the changes .No need for the extra work around.But when you are not using these all then you need to tell the adapter when the dataset is changing. Also you need to re-populate / reload your dataset (say list) and then you need to call notifyDataSetChanged() on the adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()wont work if there is no the changes in the datset.\nHere is the comment above the method in docs-I was only able to get notifyDataSetChanged only by getting new adapter data, then resetting the adapter for the list view, then making the call like so:
