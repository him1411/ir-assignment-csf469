If I have a JavaScript object such as:Is there a way to sort the properties based on value? So that I end up withI\'m having a real brain-dead moment regarding this.Move them to an array, sort that array, and then use that array for your purposes.Here\'s a solution I found via Google:Once you have the array, you could rebuild the object from the array in the order you like, thus achieving exactly what you set out to do. That would work in all the browsers I know of, but it would be dependent on an implementation quirk, and could break at any time. You should never make assumptions about the order of elements in a JavaScript object.We don\'t want to duplicate the entire data structure, or use an array where we need an associative array.Here\'s another way to do the same thing as bonna:Your objects can have any amount of properties and you can choose to sort by whatever object property you want, number or string, if you put the objects in an array. Consider this array:sort by date born, oldest firstsort by namehttp://jsfiddle.net/xsM5s/16/For completeness sake, this function returns sorted array of object properties:Jsfiddle with the code above is here. This solution is based on this article.Updated fiddle for sorting strings is here. You can remove both additional .toLowerCase() conversions from it for case sensitive string comparation.JavaScript objects are unordered by definition (see the ECMAScript Language\nSpecification, section 8.6). The language specification doesn\'t even guarantee that, if you iterate over the properties of an object twice in succession, they\'ll come out in the same order the second time.If you need things to be ordered, use an array and the Array.prototype.sort method.An "arrowed" version of @marcusR \'s answer for referenceUPDATE: EDIT April 2017\n - This returns a sorted myObj object defined above.Try it here!ECMAScript 2017 introduces Object.values / Object.entries. As the name suggests, the former aggregates all the values of an object into an array, and the latter does the whole object into an array of [key, value] arrays; Python\'s equivalent of dict.values() and dict.items().The features make it pretty easier to sort any hash into an ordered object. As of now, only a small portion of JavaScript platforms support them, but you can try it on Firefox 47+.Underscore.js or Lodash.js for advanced array or object sortsdemoI am following the solution given by slebetman (go read it for all the details), but adjusted, since your object is non-nested.Update with ES6: If your concern is having a sorted object to iterate through (which is why i\'d imagine you want your object properties sorted), you can use the Map object. You can insert your (key, value) pairs in sorted order and then doing a for..of loop will guarantee having them loop in the order you inserted themOK, as you may know, javascript has sort() function, to sort arrays, but nothing for object...So in that case, we need to somehow get array of the keys and sort them, thats the reason the apis gives you objects in an array most of the time, because Array has more native functions to play with them than object literal, anyway, the quick solotion is using Object.key which return an array of the object keys,  I create the ES6 function below which does the job for you, it uses native sort() and reduce() functions in javascript:And now you can use it like this:Check the sortedMyObject and you can see the result sorted by keys like this:Also this way, the main object won\'t be touched and we actually getting a new object.I also create the image below, to make the function steps more clear, in case you need to change it a bit to work it your way:This could be a simple way to handle it as a real ordered object. Not sure how slow it is. also might be better with a while loop.And then I found this invert function from:\nhttp://nelsonwells.net/2011/10/swap-object-key-and-values-in-javascript/So Here is one more example:many similar and useful functions:\n https://github.com/shimondoodkin/groupbyfunctions/try thisAnother way to solve this:-//res will have the result arrayThank you and continue answer @NosrednaNow that we understand object need to be converted to array then sort the array. this is useful for sorting array (or converted object to array) by string: Try this. Even your object is not having the property based on which you are trying to sort also will get handled. Just call it by sending property with object. I made a plugin just for this, it accepts 1 arg which is an unsorted object, and returns an object which has been sorted by prop value. This will work on all 2 dimensional objects such as {"Nick": 28, "Bob": 52}...Here is a demo of the function working as expected\nhttp://codepen.io/nicholasabrams/pen/RWRqve?editors=001Using query-js you can do it like thisYou can find an introductory article on query-js hereCouln\'t find answer above that would both work and be SMALL, and would support nested objects (not arrays), so I wrote my own one :) Works both with strings and ints.Usage:here is the way to get sort the object and get sorted object in returnyou can customise your sorting function as per your requirement
