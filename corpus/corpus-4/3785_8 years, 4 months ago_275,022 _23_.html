I want to see the request headers made by curl when I am sending a request to the server. How can I check that?I think curl -v is the easiest. It will spit out the request headers (lines prefixed with \'>\') without having to write to a file:I know this question is over a year old, but I hope it will help someone. The following code writes the request to a text file called request.txt, which you can then download and/or open to see what the request was like.The only way I managed to see my outgoing headers (curl with php) was using the following options:Getting your debug info:See:The --trace or --trace-ascii options are correct for the headers.For example, the request:produced the initial output:It also got a response (an 302 response, to be precise but irrelevant) which was logged.curl --trace-ascii {filename} or use a single dash instead of file name to get it sent to stdout:CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION if you\'re using libcurlThis shows you everything curl sends and receives, with some extra info thrown in.I tried the answers here and found that the most useful and easiest one is not listed as an answer yet, but it is:This prints out the REQUEST headers as well as the RESPONSE headers plus other useful such as the SSL cert and whether an existing TCP connection was reused. the -v flag can be combined with other flags, of course, such as to follow redirects and prompt for HTTP authentication:Hope this helps.dump the headers in one file and the payload of the response in a different fileYou could also use -I option if you want to send a HEAD request and not a GET request.Here is my http client in php to make post queries with cookies included:/// DEBUG info\necho $response;\nvar_dump (curl_getinfo($ch));\n///You can use wireshark or tcpdump to look on any network traffic (http too).You can see it by using -ivMake a sample request to https://http-tools.appspot.com/reflect-http-request/some-unique-id and check what this request contains (request header, request body, request parameters) by its corresponding finder url https://http-tools.appspot.com/reflect-http-request-finder/some-unique-id. You can use any string instead of some-unique-id, check out https://http-tools.appspot.com for more details.
