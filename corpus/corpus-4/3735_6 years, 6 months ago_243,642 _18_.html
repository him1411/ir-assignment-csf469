How do I delete a file with node.js?http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_rename_oldpath_newpath_callbackI don\'t see a remove command?I think you want to use fs.unlink.More info on fs can be found here.You can call fs.unlink(path, callback) for Asynchronous unlink(2) or fs.unlinkSync(path) for Synchronous unlink(2).\nWhere path is file-path which you want to remove.   For example we want to remove discovery.docx file from c:/book directory. So my file-path is c:/book/discovery.docx. So code for removing that file will be,   If you want to check file before delete whether it exist or not. So, use fs.stat or fs.statSync (Synchronous) instead of fs.exists. Because according to the latest node.js documentation, fs.exists now deprecated.For example:-Here is a small snippet of I made for this purpose,I think you don\'t have to check if file exists or not, fs.unlink will check it for you.As the accepted answer, use fs.unlink to delete files.But according to Node.js documentationUsing fs.stat() to check for the existence of a file before calling fs.open(), fs.readFile() or fs.writeFile() is not recommended. Instead, user code should open/read/write the file directly and handle the error raised if the file is not available.To check if a file exists without manipulating it afterwards, fs.access() is recommended.to check files can be deleted or not, Use fs.access insteadyou can use del module to remove one or more files in the current directory. what\'s nice about it is that protects you against deleting the current working directory and above.Here the code where you can delete file/image from folder.
