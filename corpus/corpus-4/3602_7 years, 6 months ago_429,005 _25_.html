I want to replace all the occurrences of a dot(.) in a JavaScript stringFor example, I have:I want to get: okay this is a string.So far I tried:but this ends up with all the string replaced to spaces.You need to escape the . because it has the meaning of "an arbitrary character" in a regular expression.One more solution which is easy to understand :)Faster than using regex...EDIT:\nMaybe at the time I did this code I did not used jsperf. But in the end such discussion is totally pointless, the performance difference is not worth the legibility of the code in the real world, so my answer is still valid, even if the performance differs from the regex approach.EDIT2:\nI have created a lib that allows you to do this using a fluent interface:See https://github.com/FagnerMartinsBrack/str-replace.For this simple scenario, i would also recommend to use the methods that comes build-in in javascript.You could try this :GreetingsI add double backslash to the dot to make it work. Cheer.This is more concise/readable and should perform better than the one posted by Fagner Brack (toLowerCase not performed in loop):Usage:Here\'s another implementation of replaceAll. Hope it helps someone.Then you can use it:var myText = "My Name is George";\nvar newText = myText.replaceAll("George", "Michael");Example: I want to replace all double Quote (") into single Quote (\') Then the code will be like this@scripto\'s made a bit more concise and without prototype:Here\'s how it stacks up: http://jsperf.com/replace-vs-split-join-vs-replaceall/68you can replace all occurrence of any string/character using RegExp javasscript object.Here is the code,
