In the few years I\'ve been using C# (WinForms), I\'ve never used WPF. But, now I love WPF, but I don\'t know how I am supposed to exit my application when the user clicks on the Exit menu item from the File menu.I have tried:Among many others. Nothing works.To exit your application you can call As described in the documentation to the Application.Shutdown method you can also modify the shutdown behavior of your application by specifying a ShutdownMode:Shutdown  is implicitly called by Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) in the following situations:Please also note that Application.Current.Shutdown(); may only be called from the thread that created the Application object, i.e. normally the main thread.If you REALLY need it to close out you can also use Environment.Exit() but it is not graceful at all (more like ending the process).Use as follows:As wuminqi said, Application.Current.Shutdown(); is irreversible and I believe it is typically used to force an application to close at times such as when a user is logging off or shutting down Windows. Instead, call this.close() in your main window. This is the same as pressing "ALT-F4" or the close [x] button on the window. This will cause all other owned windows to close and will end up calling Application.Current.Shutdown(); so long as the close action wasn\'t cancelled. Please see the MSDN documentation on Closing a Window.Also, because this.close() is cancellable you can put in a save changes confirmation dialog in the closing event handler. Simply make an event handler for <Window Closing="..."> and change e.Cancel accordingly. (See the MSDN doc for more details on how to do this)This should do the trick: If you\'re interested, here\'s some additional material that I found helpful:Details on Application.CurrentWPF Application LifeCycleUse any of the following as needed:1.2.Above all methods will call closing event of Window class and execution may stop at some point (cause usually applications put dialogues like \'are you sure?\' or \'Would you like to save data before closing?\', before a window is closed completely) 3. But if you want to terminate the application without any warning immediately. Use belowThere should not be an Application.ShutDown(); or .Exit() message.Application is a static class. It does not refer to the current application\nYou need to get to the current application and then shut it down like this:Here\'s how I do mine:I only call for Application.Current.ShutDown() from the main application window, all other windows use this.Close().  In my main window, Window_Closing(...) handles the top right x button.  If any of the methods call for window closer, Window_Closing(...) grabs the event for shut down if user confirms.The reason I do in fact use Application.Current.Shutdown() in my main window is that I\'ve noticed that if a design mistake was made and I haven\'t declared a parent of one of my windows in an application, if that window is opened without being shown prior to the last active window closing, I\'m left with a hidden window running in the background.  The application will not shut down.  The only way to prevent complete memory leak is for me to go into the Task Manager to shut down the application.  Application.Current.Shutdown() protects me from unintended design flaws.That is from my personal experience.  In the end, use what is best for your scenario.  This is just another piece of information.Try For me didn\'t work.According to my understanding, Application.Current.Shutdown() also has its drawback,if you want to show a confirm window to let users confirm on quit or not, Application.Current.Shutdown() is irreversible.Caliburn micro flavouredWe can Use the this.Close() method in the MainWindow.xaml.cs file to close the window.Or use the App.Current.Shutdown() method in the MainWindow.xaml.cs file to close the window.  Very simple, Use the below code
