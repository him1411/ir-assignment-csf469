When sending data over HTTPS, I know the content is encrypted, however I hear mixed answers about whether the headers are encrypted, or how much of the header is encrypted.How much of HTTPS headers are encrypted?Including GET/POST request URLs, Cookies, etc.The whole lot is encrypted\xe2\x80\xa0 - all the headers.\nThat\'s why SSL on vhosts doesn\'t work too well - you need a dedicated IP address because the Host header is encrypted.\xe2\x80\xa0The Server Name Identification (SNI) standard means that the hostname may not be encrypted if you\'re using TLS. Also, whether you\'re using SNI or not, the TCP and IP headers are never encrypted. (If they were, your packets would not be routable.)The headers are entirely encrypted. The only information going over the network \'in the clear\' is related to the SSL setup and D/H key exchange. This exchange is carefully designed not to yield any useful information to eavesdroppers, and once it has taken place, all data is encrypted.HTTP version 1.1 added a special HTTP method, CONNECT - intended to create the SSL tunnel, including the necessary protocol handshake and cryptographic setup.\nThe regular requests thereafter all get sent wrapped in the SSL tunnel, headers and body inclusive.With SSL the encryption is at the transport level, so it takes place before a request is sent.So everything in the request is encrypted.New answer to old question, sorry.  I thought I\'d add my $.02The OP asked if the headers were encrypted.They are: in transit.They are NOT: when not in transit.So, your browser\'s URL (and title, in some cases) can display the querystring (which usually contain the most sensitive details) and some details in the header; the browser knows some header information (content type, unicode, etc); and browser history, password management, favorites/bookmarks, and cached pages will all contain the querystring.  Server logs on the remote end can also contain querystring as well as some content details.Also, the URL isn\'t always secure: the domain, protocol, and port are visible - otherwise routers don\'t know where to send your requests and firewalls don\'t know how to filter on protocol, port, or address.Also, if you\'ve got an HTTP proxy, the proxy server knows the address, usually they don\'t know the full querystring.So if the data is moving, it\'s generally protected.  If it\'s not in transit, it\'s not encrypted.Not to nit pick, but data at the end is also decrypted, and can be parsed, read, saved, forwarded, or discarded at will.  And, malware at either end can take snapshots of data entering (or exiting) the SSL protocol - such as (bad) Javascript inside a page inside HTTPS which can surreptitiously make http (or https) calls to logging websites (since access to local harddrive is often restricted and not useful).Also, cookies are not encrypted under the HTTPS protocol, either.  Developers wanting to store sensitive data in cookies (or anywhere else for that matter) need to use their own encryption mechanism.As to cache, most modern browsers won\'t cache HTTPS pages, but that fact is not defined by the HTTPS protocol, it is entirely dependent on the developer of a browser to be sure not to cache pages received through HTTPS.So if you\'re worried about packet sniffing, you\'re probably okay.  But if you\'re worried about malware or someone poking through your history, bookmarks, cookies, or cache, you are not out of the water yet.HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) sends all HTTP content over a SSL tunel, so HTTP content and headers are encrypted as well. Yes, headers are encrypted. It\'s written here.Everything in the HTTPS message is encrypted, including the headers, and the request/response load.the URL is also encrypted, you really only have the IP, Port and if SNI, the host name that are unencrypted.
