I have some data either in list contains lists, or list contains tuples.And I want to sort by the 2nd element in the subset. Meaning, sorting by 2,5,8 where 2 is from (1,2,3), 5 is from (4,5,6). What is the common way to do this? Should I store tuples or lists in my list? Since tuples are more inflexible.or:Stephen\'s answer is the one I\'d use.  For completeness, here\'s the DSU (decorate-sort-undecorate) pattern with list comprehensions:Or, more tersely:As noted in the Python Sorting HowTo, this has been unnecessary since Python 2.4, when key functions became available.I just want to add to Stephen\'s answer if you want to sort the array from high to low, another way other than in the comments above is just to add this to the line: and the result will be as follows:For sorting by multiple criteria, namely for instance by the second and third elements in a tuple, letand so define a lambda that returns a tuple that describes priority, for instanceIn more general case (without using lambda) you can use defined function:and then use key to sort it by second parameter:In order to sort a list of tuples (<word>, <count>), for count in descending order and word in alphabetical order:I use this method:and it gives me the result:itemgetter() is somewhat faster than lambda tup: tup[1], but the increase is relatively modest (around 10 to 25 percent).(IPython session)@Stephen \'s answer is to the point! Here is an example for better visualization,Shout out for the Ready Player One fans! =)key is a function that will be called to transform the collection\'s items for comparison.. like compareTo method in Java. The parameter passed to key must be something that is callable. Here, the use of lambda creates an anonymous function (which is a callable).\nThe syntax of lambda is the word lambda followed by a iterable name then a single block of code. Below example, we are sorting a list of tuple that holds the info abt time of certain event and actor name. We are sorting this list by time of event occurrence - which is the 0th element of a tuple.Note - s.sort([cmp[, key[, reverse]]])  sorts the items of s in placeSorting a tuple is quite simple:
