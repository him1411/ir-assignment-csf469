I have many annotations in a mapview (with rightCalloutAccessory buttons). The button will perform a segue from this mapview to a tableview.  I want to pass the tableview a different object (that holds data) depending on which callout button was clicked.For example: (totally made up)I am able to detect which callout button was clicked.I\'m using prepareForSegue: to pass the data obj to the destination ViewController.  Since I cannot make this call take an extra argument for the data obj I require, what are some elegant ways to achieve the same effect (dynamic data obj)?Any tip would be appreciated.Simply grab a reference to the target view controller in prepareForSegue: method and pass any objects you need to there. Here\'s an example...REVISION:  You can also use performSegueWithIdentifier:sender: method to activate the transition to a new view based on a selection or button press.  For instance, consider I had two view controllers.  The first contains three buttons and the second needs to know which of those buttons has been pressed before the transition.  You could  wire the buttons up to an IBAction in your code which uses performSegueWithIdentifier: method, like this...EDIT:  The demo application I originally attached is now six years old, so I\'ve removed it to avoid any confusion.The accepted answer is not the best way of doing this, because it creates an unnecessary compile-time dependency between two view controllers. Here\'s how you can do it without caring about the type of the destination view controller:So as long as your destination view controller declares a public property, e.g.:you can set this property in the previous view controller as I described above.I have a sender class, like thisI use this sender class for passing objects to prepareForSeque:sender:In Swift I would do something like that: I came across this question when I was trying to learn how to pass data from one View Controller to another. I need something visual to help me learn though, so this answer is a supplement to the others already here. It is a little more general than the original question but it can be adapted to work.This basic example works like this:The idea is to pass a string from the text field in the First View Controller to the label in the Second View Controller.How to send data through segue (swift) (YouTube tutorial)View Controllers: Passing data forward and passing data back (fuller answer)I\'ve implemented a library with a category on UIViewController that simplifies this operation.\nBasically, you set the parameters you want to pass over in a NSDictionary associated to the UI item that is performing the segue. It works with manual segues too.For example, you can dofor a manual segue or create a button with a segue and useIf destination view controller is not key-value coding compliant for a key, nothing happens. It works with key-values too (useful for unwind segues).\nCheck it out here\nhttps://github.com/stefanomondino/SMQuickSegueFor Swift use this,My solution is similar.  I used this solution so that I could keep the invocation of the segue and the data communication within the same function:A use case would be something like:This seems to work for me, however, I\'m not 100% sure that the perform and prepare functions are always executed on the same thread.
