I have a datetime column in MySQL. How can I convert it to the display as mm/dd/yy H:M (AM/PM) using PHP?If you\'re looking for a way to normalize a date into MySQL format, use the followingThe line $phpdate = strtotime( $mysqldate ) accepts a string and performs a series of heuristics to turn that string into a unix timestamp.The line $mysqldate = date( \'Y-m-d H:i:s\', $phpdate ) uses that timestamp and PHP\'s date function to turn that timestamp back into MySQL\'s standard date format.(Editor Note: This answer is here because of an original question with confusing wording, and the general Google usefulness this answer provided even if it didnt\' directly answer the question that now exists)To convert a date retrieved from MySQL into the format requested (mm/dd/yy H:M (AM/PM)):Refer to the PHP date formatting options to adjust the format.If you are using PHP 5, you can also tryReference: http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.phpAn easier way would be to format the date directly in the MySQL query, instead of PHP.  See the MySQL manual entry for DATE_FORMAT.If you\'d rather do it in PHP, then you need the date function, but you\'ll have to convert your database value into a timestamp first.Finally the right solution for PHP 5.3 and above:Forget all. Just use:To correctly format a DateTime object in PHP for storing in MySQL use the standardised format that MySQL uses, which is ISO 8601.PHP has had this format stored as a constant since version 5.1.1, and I highly recommend using it rather than manually typing the string each time.This, and a list of other PHP DateTime constants are available at http://php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php#datetime.constants.typesThis should format a field in an SQL query:Use the date function:Depending on your MySQL datetime configuration. Typically: 2011-12-31 07:55:13 format. This very simple function should do the magic:Or a bit more advance to match the question.If you dont want to change every function in your PHP code, to show the expected date format, change it at the source - your database.It is important to name the rows with the as operator as in the example above (as dateFrom, as dateUntil). The names you write there are the names, the rows will be called in your result.The output of this example will be [Day of the month, numeric (0..31)].[Month name (January..December)].[Year, numeric, four digits]Example: 5.August.2015Change the dots with the separator of choice and check the DATE_FORMAT(date,format) function for more date formats.You can also have your query return the time as a Unix timestamp. That would get rid of the need to call strtotime() and make things a bit less intensive on the PHP side...Then in PHP just use the date() function to format it whichever way you\'d like.or I like this approach as opposed to using MySQL\'s DATE_FORMAT function, because it allows you to reuse the same query to grab the data and allows you to alter the formatting in PHP.It\'s annoying to have two different queries just to change the way the date looks in the UI.You can have trouble with dates not returned in Unix Timestamp, so this works for me...This will work...Using PHP version 4.4.9 & MySQL 5.0, this worked for me:PubDate is the column in MySQL.
