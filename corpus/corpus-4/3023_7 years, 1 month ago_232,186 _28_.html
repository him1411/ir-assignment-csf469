This is what I tried to get a transparent ImageButton so as to place those buttons on a SurfaceView. But Eclipse, gives me an error in the project as soon as I include the transparent line in xml.Please help.Try using null for the background ...DON\'T USE A TRANSAPENT OR NULL LAYOUT because then the button (or the generic view) will no more highlight at click!!!I had the same problem and finally I found the correct attribute from Android API to solve the problem. It can apply to any view.Use this in the button specifications:You can also use a transparent color:Setting the background to "@null" will make the button have no effect when clicked. This will be a better choice.Later I found that using is also a good solution. And you can inherit this attribute in your own style.in run time, you can use following code Remove this line : And in your activity class set You can set alpha level 0 to 255o means transparent and 255 means opaque.  I believe the accepted answer should be:\n\nandroid:background="?attr/selectableItemBackground"\nThis is the same as @lory105\'s answer but it uses the support library for maximum compatibility (the android: equivalent is only available for API >= 11)The best way is using the transparent color code use the color code #00000000 for making any thing transparent Use ImageView... it have transparent background by default...Just use this code in your .java file:This is  programatically set background color as transparentProgrammatically it can be done by :In your XML set Background attribute to any colour White(#FFFFFF) shade or Black(#000000) shade.if you want transparency just put 80 before the actual hash code.   Use this:Set the background of the ImageButton as @null in XMLUse "@null" . It worked for me. I used a transparent png for the ImageButton, and the ImageButton worked.
