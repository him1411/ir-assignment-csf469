What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between \\n (newline) and \\r (carriage return)?In particular, are there any practical differences between \\n and \\r? Are there places where one should be used instead of the other?In terms of ascii code, it\'s 3 -- since they\'re 10 and 13 respectively;-).But seriously, there are many:In practice, in the modern context of writing to a text file, you should always use \\n (the underlying runtime will translate that if you\'re on a weird OS, e.g., Windows;-). The only reason to use \\r is if you\'re writing to a character terminal (or more likely a "console window" emulating it) and want the next line you write to overwrite the last one you just wrote (sometimes used for goofy "ascii animation" effects of e.g. progress bars) -- this is getting pretty obsolete in a world of GUIs, though;-).Historically a \\n was used to move the carriage down, while the \\r was used to move the carriage back to the left side of the page.Two different characters.\\n is used as an end-of-line terminator in Unix text files\\r is used as an end-of-line terminator in Mac text files\\r\\n (ie both) are used to terminate lines in Windows and DOS text files.Since nobody else mentioned it specifically (are they too young to know/remember?) - I suspect the use of \\r\\n originated for typewriters and similar devices.When you wanted a new line while using a multi-line-capable typewriter, there were two physical actions it had to perform: slide the carriage back to the beginning (left, in US) of the page, and feed the paper up one notch.Back in the days of line printers the only way to do bold text, for example, was to do a carriage return WITHOUT a newline and print the same characters over the old ones, thus adding more ink, thus making it appear darker (bolded). When the mechanical "newline" function failed in a typewriter, this was the annoying result: you could type over the previous line of text if you weren\'t paying attention.Two different characters for different Operating Systems. Also this plays a role in data transmitted over TCP/IP which requires the use of \\r\\n.\\n Unix\\r Mac\\r\\n Windows and DOS.To complete,In a shell (bash) script, you can use \\r to send cursor, in front on line and, of course \\n to put cursor on a new line.For example, try :But don\'t forget to use -en as parameters.In windows, the \\n moves to the beginning of the next line.  The \\r moves to the beginning of the current line, without moving to the next line.  I have used \\r in my own console apps where I am testing out some code and I don\'t want to see text scrolling up my screen, so rather than use \\n after printing out some text, of say, a frame rate (FPS), I will printf("%-10d\\r", fps);  This will return the cursor to the beginning of the line without moving down to the next line and allow me to have other information on the screen that doesn\'t get scrolled off while the framerate constantly updates on the same line (the %-10 makes certain the output is at least 10 characters, left justified so it ends up padded by spaces, overwriting any old values for that line).  It\'s quite handy for stuff like this, usually when I have debugging stuff output to my console screen.A little historyThe /r stands for "return" or "carriage return" which owes it\'s history to the typewriter.  A carriage return moved your carriage all the way to the right so you were typing at the start of the line.The /n stands for "new line", again, from typewriter days you moved down to a new line.  Not nessecarily to the start of it though, which is why some OSes adopted the need for both a /r return followed by a /n newline, as that was the order a typewriter did it in.  It also explains the old 8bit computers that used to have "Return" rather than "Enter", from "carriage return", which was familiar.lets take this example try putting \\n in place of \\r it will not work and try to guess why?
