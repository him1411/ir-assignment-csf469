I am new to partial classes and was wondering if someone could give me an overview of why I would use them and what advantage I would gain in the process.The biggest use of partial classes is to make life easier for code generators / designers. Partial classes allow the generator to simply omit the code they need to omit and they do not have to deal with user edits to the file.  Users are likewise free to annotate the class with new members by having a second partial class. This provides a very clean framework for separation of concerns.A better way to look at it is to see how designers functioned before partial classes.  The WinForms designer would spit out all of the code inside of a region with strongly worded comments about not modifying the code. It had to insert all sorts of heuristics to find the generated code for later processing.  Now it can simply open the designer.cs file and have a high degree of confidence that it contains only code relevant to the designer. Another use is to split the implementation of different interfaces, e.g:Aside from the other answers...I\'ve found them helpful as a stepping-stone in refactoring god-classes.  If a class has multiple responsibilities (especially if it\'s a very large code-file) then I find it beneficial to add 1x partial class per-responsibility as a first-pass for organizing and then refactoring the code.This helps greatly because it can help with making the code much more readable without actually effecting the executing behavior.  It also can help identify when a responsibility is easy to refactor out or is tightly tangled with other aspects.However--to be clear--this is still bad code, at the end of development you still want one responsibility per-class (NOT per partial class).  It\'s just a stepping-stone :)Partial Method Declaration only Even the code get compiled with method declaration only and if the implementation\nof the method isn\'t present compiler can safely remove that piece of\ncode and no compile time error will occur.To verify point 4. Just create a winform project and include this line after the Form1 Constructor and try to compile the codeHere are some points to consider while implementing partial classes:-One great use is separating generated code from hand-written code that belong in the same class.For example since LINQ to SQL uses partial classes you can write your own implementation of certain pieces of functionality (like Many-to-Many relationships) and those pieces of custom code won\'t get overwritten when you re-generate the code.The same goes for WinForms code. All the Designer generated code goes in one file that you generally don\'t touch. Your hand-written code goes in another file. That way, when you change something in Designer, your changes don\'t get blown away.It is true that Partial Class is used in auto code generation, one use can be maintaining a large class file which might have thousand lines of code. You never know your class might end up with 10 thousand lines and you don\'t want to create a new class with different name.Another possible use could be that more than one developer can work on the same class as they are stored at different places. People might laugh but you never know it can be handful sometimes.Hope it makes sense!keep everything as clean as possible when working with huge classes, or when working on a team, you can edit without overriding (or always commiting changes)The main use for partial classes is with generated code. If you look at the WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) network, you define your UI with markup (XML). That markup is compiled into partial classes. You fill in code with partial classes of your own.Partial classes span multiple files.How can you use the partial modifier on a C# class declaration?With partial, you can physically separate a class into multiple files.This is often done by code generators.ExampleWith normal C# classes, you cannot declare a class in two separate files in the same project.But with the partial modifier, you can. This is useful if one file is commonly edited and the other is machine-generated or rarely edited.An Example will clear your concept.Partial is required here.If you remove the partial modifier, you will get an error containing this text: [The namespace \'<global namespace>\' already contains a definition for \'A\'].Tip:\nTo fix this, you can either use the partial keyword, or change one of the class names.How does the C# compiler deal with partial classes?If you disassemble the above program, you will see that the files A1.cs and A2.cs are eliminated.You will find that the class A is present.IL Disassembler\nSo:\nClass A will contain the methods A1 and A2 in the same code block. The two classes were merged into one.Compiled result of A1.cs and A2.cs: C#SummaryPartial classes can simplify certain C# programming situations. They are often used in Visual Studio when creating Windows Forms/WPF programs.The machine-generated C# code is separate.Or You could find the whole Description here .Another use i saw is,Extending  a big abstract class regarding data access logic ,i have various files with names Post.cs,Comment.cs,Pages.cs...If you have a sufficiently large class that doesn\'t lend itself to effective refactoring, separating it into multiple files helps keep things organized. For instance, if you have a database for a site containing a discussion forum and a products system, and you don\'t want to create two different providers classes (NOT the same thing as a proxy class, just to be clear), you can create a single partial class in different files, likeMyProvider.cs - core logicMyProvider.Forum.cs - methods pertaining specifically to the forumMyProvider.Product.cs - methods for productsIt\'s just another way to keep things organized. Also, as others have said, it\'s about the only way to add methods to a generated class without running the risk of having your additions destroyed the next time the class is regenerated. This comes in handy with template-generated (T4) code, ORMs, etc.Service references are another example where partial classes are useful to separate generated code from user-created code.You can "extend" the service classes without having them overwritten when you update the service reference.Partial classes make it possible to add functionality to a suitably-designed program merely by adding source files.  For example, a file-import program could be designed so that one could add different types of known files by adding modules that handle them.  For example, the main file type converter could include a small class:Each module that wishes to register one or more types of file converter could include something like:Note that the main file converter class isn\'t "exposed"--it just exposes a little stub class that add-in modules can hook to.  There is a slight risk of naming conflicts, but if each add-in module\'s "register" routine is named according to the type of file it deals with, they probably shouldn\'t pose a problem.  One could stick a GUID in the name of the registration subroutine if one were worried about such things.Edit/Addendum\nTo be clear, the purpose of this is to provide a means by which a variety of separate classes can let a main program or class know about them.  The only thing the main file converter will do with zzFileConverterRegistrar is create one instance of it and call the registerAll method which will fire the Register event.  Any module that wants to hook that event can execute arbitrary code in response to it (that\'s the whole idea) but there isn\'t anything a module could do by improperly extending the zzFileConverterRegistrar class other than define a method whose name matches that of something else.  It would certainly be possible for one improperly-written extension to break another improperly-written extension, but the solution for that is for anyone who doesn\'t want his extension broken to simply write it properly.One could, without using partial classes, have a bit of code somewhere within the main file converter class, which looked like:but adding another converter module would require going into that part of the converter code and adding the new converter to the list.  Using partial methods, that is no longer necessary--all converters will get included automatically.As an alternative to pre-compiler directives.If you use pre-compiler directives (namely #IF DEBUG) then you end up with some gnarly looking code intermingled with your actual Release code.You can create a seperate partial-class to contain this code, and either wrap the entire partial class in a directive, or omit that code-file from being sent to the compiler (effectively doing the same).Most people remark that partial should only be used for a class that has a generated code file or for interfaces.  I disagree, and here is why.For one example, let\'s look at the C# System.Math class... that\'s class.  I would not attempt to stuff 70+ methods all into the same single code file.  It would be a nightmare to maintain.Placing each math method into individual partial class files, and all code files into a Math folder in the project, would be significantly cleaner organization.The same could/would hold true for many other classes that have a large amount of diverse functionality.  For example a class for managing the PrivateProfile API might benefit by being split into a clean set of partial class files in a single project folder.Personally, I also split what most people call "helper" or "utility" classes into individual partial files for each method or method functional group.  For example on one project the string helper class has almost 50 methods.  That would be a long unwieldy code file even using regions.  It is significantly easier to maintain using individual partial class files for each method.I would just be careful using partial classes and keep all code file layout consistent throughout the project when doing this. Such as placing any class public enums and class private members into a Common.cs or similarly named file in the folder, instead of spreading them out across the files unless they are specific to only the partial file they are contained in.Keep in mind that when you split a class into separate files you also lose the ability to use the text editor splitter bar that lets you view two different sections of a current file simultaneously.Partial classes recently helped with source control where multiple developers were adding to one file where new methods were added into the same part of the file (automated by Resharper).  These pushes to git caused merge conflicts.  I found no way to tell the merge tool to take the  new methods as a complete code block.Partial classes in this respect allows for developers to stick to a version of their file, and we can merge them back in later by hand.example -From MSDN:1.At compile time, attributes of partial-type definitions are merged. For example, consider the following declarations:They are equivalent to the following declarations:The following are merged from all the partial-type definitions:XML commentsinterfacesgeneric-type parameter attributesclass attributesmembers2.Another thing, nested partial classes can be also partial:Here is a list of some of the advantages of partial classes.You can separate UI design code and business logic code so that it is easy to read and understand. For example you are developing an web application using Visual Studio and add a new web form then there are two source files, "aspx.cs" and "aspx.designer.cs" . These two files have the same class with the partial keyword. The ".aspx.cs" class has the business logic code while "aspx.designer.cs" has user interface control definition.When working with automatically generated source, the code can be added to the class without having to recreate the source file. For example you are working with LINQ to SQL and create a DBML file. Now when you drag and drop a table it creates a partial class in designer.cs and all table columns have properties in the class. You need more columns in this table to bind on the UI grid but you don\'t want to add a new column to the database table so you can create a separate source file for this class that has a new property for that column and it will be a partial class. So that does affect the mapping between database table and DBML entity but you can easily get an extra field. It means you can write the code on your own without messing with the system generated code.More than one developer can simultaneously write the code for the class.You can maintain your application better by compacting large classes. Suppose you have a class that has multiple interfaces so you can create multiple source files depending on interface implements. It is easy to understand and maintain an interface implemented on which the source file has a partial class.Whenever I have a class that contains a nested class that is of any significant size/complexity, I mark the class as partial and put the nested class in a separate file. I name the file containing the nested class using the rule: [class name].[nested class name].cs.The following MSDN blog explains using partial classes with nested classes for maintainability: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/marcelolr/archive/2009/04/13/using-partial-classes-with-nested-classes-for-maintainability.aspxPartial classes are primarily introduced to help Code generators, so we (users) don\'t end up loosing all our work / changes to the generated classes like ASP.NET\'s .designer.cs class each time we regenerate, almost all new tools that generate code LINQ, EntityFrameworks, ASP.NET use partial classes for generated code, so we can safely add or alter logic of these generated codes taking advantage of Partial classes and methods, but be very carefully before you add stuff to the generated code using Partial classes its easier if we break the build but worst if we introduce runtime errors.
