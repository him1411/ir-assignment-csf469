Is there any built-in method in Java which allows us to convert comma separated String to some container (e.g array, List or Vector)? Or do I need to write custom code for that? Convert comma separated String to ListThe above code splits the string on a delimiter defined as: zero or more whitespace, a literal comma, zero or more whitespace which will place the words into the list and collapse any whitespace between the words and commas.Please note that this returns simply a wrapper on an array: you CANNOT for example .remove() from the resulting List.  For an actual ArrayList you must further use new ArrayList<String>.Arrays.asList returns a fixed-size List backed by the array. If you want a normal mutable java.util.ArrayList you need to do this:Or, using Guava:Using a Splitter gives you more flexibility in how you split the string and gives you the ability to, for example, skip empty strings in the results and trim results. It also has less weird behavior than String.split as well as not requiring you to split by regex (that\'s just one option).Two steps: Here is another one for converting  CSV to ArrayList:  Prints you-->string\n      -->with\n      -->commaThere is no built-in method for this but you can simply use split() method in this.That should work for you.you can combine asList and splitIf a List is the end-goal as the OP stated, then already accepted answer is still the shortest and the best. However I want to provide you alternatives using Java 8 Streams, that will give you more benefit if it is part of a pipeline for further processing.By wrapping the result of the .split function (a native array) into a stream and then converting to a list.Or by using the RegEx parsing api:By themselves, these code examples do not seem to add a lot (except more typing), but if you are planning to do more, like this answer on converting a String to a List of Longs exemplifies, the streaming API is really powerful by allowing to pipeline your operations one after the other. For the sake of, you know, completeness.An example using Collections.This below code may help you,You can first split them using String.split(","), and then convert the returned String array to an ArrayList using Arrays.asList(array)In groovy, you can use tokenize(Character Token) method:I usually use precompiled pattern for the list. And also this is slightly more universal since it can consider brackets which follows some of the listToString expressions.String -> Collection conversion: (String -> String[] -> Collection)Collection -> String[] conversion:String -> String[] conversion:And Collection -> Collection:You can use Guava to split the string, and convert it into an ArrayList. This works with an empty string as well, and returns an empty list. outputs the following:convert Collection into string as comma seperated in Java 8listOfString object contains ["A","B","C" ,"D"] elements-Output is :-\n\'A\',\'B\',\'C\',\'D\'And Convert Strings Array to List in Java 8You can StringUtils from apache lib.Example
