I am using Google Apps API for my application and trying to authorize it using OAuth2. I have created a project and an application within it using the Google API console. I am using the following URL for authorization:I get the following error,I have verified the clientid and even the status of admin SDK.That error is displayed in case that under "APIs & auth" -> "Consent screen" you have empty field "PRODUCT NAME" - you need to select e-mail address as well.You can find "Consent screen" under a link!, click on project name and then go to "APIs & auth" -> "Consent screen".As @Chris-Kempen says, you have to recreate all necessary OAuth ids AFTER you have set the support email for your application.If you create OAuth credentials BEFORE you set the support email address in the consent screen, then it appears that you will always get this error.I got a similar issue, maybe that could help others :My error was an "invalid client type" instead of "no application name", \nand setting the email and the name of the project did not solve my problem. However, I had registered my project as a WebApp. When I changed that to "Other", it eventually worked.
