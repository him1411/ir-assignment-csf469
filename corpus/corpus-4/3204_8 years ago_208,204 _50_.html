Many Java applications that use shell scripts to configure their environment use the JAVA_HOME environment variable to start the correct version of Java, locate JRE JARs, and so on.On OSX 10.6, the following paths seem to be valid for this variableSome of these are symlinks to the actual current VM (as defined in the Java Preference pane). But which one should be used\xe2\x80\x94or is it okay to use any of them?Does Snow Leopard still have /usr/libexec/java_home? On 10.5, I just set JAVA_HOME to the output of that command, which should give you the Java path specified in your Java preferences. Here\'s a snippet from my .bashrc file, which sets this variable:I haven\'t experienced any problems with that technique.Occasionally I do have to change the value of JAVA_HOME to an earlier version of Java. For example, one program I\'m maintaining requires 32-bit Java 5 on OS X, so when using that program, I set JAVA_HOME by running: For those of you who don\'t have java_home in your path add it like this.Also, it`s interesting to set your PATH to reflect the JDK. After adding JAVA_HOME (which can be done with the example cited by \'mipadi\'):export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)Add also in ~/.profile:export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATHP.S.: For OSX, I generally use .profile in the HOME dir instead of .bashrcNowadays Java seems to be installed in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachinesI tend to use /Library/Java/Home.  The way the preferences pane works this should be up to date with your preferred version.I\'m on Mac OS 10.6.8The easiest solution works for me is simply put inTo test whether it works, put init showsyou can also test That above works not any more in YOSEMITE for GRAPHICAL APPLICATIONS! Like eclipse, or anything started with Spotlight. (.bash_profile, launchd.conf works for terminal sessions only.) \nBefore starting eclipse, just open a terminal window, and give out the following command:launchctl setenv JAVA_HOME /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home(With your installation path! Perhaps works with $(/usr/libexec/java_home) instead of the full path too.)View the whole excellent article about the permanent solution here:\nSetting environment variables via launchd.conf no longer works in OS X Yosemite/El Capitan/macOS Sierra?I am having MAC OS X(Sierra) 10.12.2. I set JAVA_HOME to work on React Native(for Android apps) by following the following steps.Open Terminal (Command+R, type Terminal, Hit ENTER).Add the following lines to ~/.bash_profile.\n\nexport JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)\nNow run the following command. \n\nsource ~/.bash_profile\nYou can check the exact value of JAVA_HOME by typing the following command.\n\necho $JAVA_HOME\nThe value(output) returned will be something like below.\n\n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_131.jdk/Contents/Home\nThat\'s it.I\'ve found this stack to help, i was having the same issue and i could fix:My java path was here:/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Homeand was needed to put into my .bash_profile:export JAVA_HOME=\\"/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home\\"Hope helpAs other answers note, the correct way to find the Java home directory is to use /usr/libexec/java_home.The official documentation for this is in Apple\'s Technical Q&A QA1170: Important Java Directories on OS X: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1170/_index.htmlFor me maven seems to work off the .mavenrc file:I\'m sure I picked it up on SO too, just can\'t remember where.Create file ~/.mavenrcthen paste this into the file export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)testmvn -vSkipping Terminal setup since you mentioned applications, permanent system environment variable set up (works for macOS Sierra; should work for El Capitan too):  (this will set JAVA_HOME to the latest 1.8 JDK, chances are you have gone through serveral updates e.g. javac 1.8.0_101, javac 1.8.0_131)\nOf course, change 1.8 to 1.7 or 1.6 (really?) to suit your need and your system  For Fish Shell users, use something like the following: alias java7 "set -gx JAVA_HOME (/usr/libexec/java_home -v1.7)"
