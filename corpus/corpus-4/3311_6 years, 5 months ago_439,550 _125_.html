I wanted to make my app look more professional, so I decided that I wanted to make a splash screen.How would I create it and then implement it?Further reading:Old answer:HOW TO: Simple splash screenThis answers shows you how to display a splash screen for a fixed amount of time when your app starts for e.g. branding reasons. E.g. you might choose to show the splash screen for 3 seconds. However if you want to show the spash screen for a variable amount of time (e.g. app startup time) you should check out Abdullah\'s answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/15832037/401025. However be aware that app startup might be very fast on new devices so the user will just see a flash which is bad UX.First you need to define the spash screen in your layout.xml fileAnd your activity:Thats all ;)Note this solution will not let the user wait more: the delay of the splash screen depends on the start up time of the application.When you open any android app you will get  by default a some what black screen with the title and icon of the app on top, you can change that by using a style/theme.First, create a style.xml in values folder and add a style to it.Instead of using @android:style/Theme.DeviceDefault.Light.NoActionBar you can use any other theme as a parent.Second, in your app Manifest.xml add android:theme="@style/splashScreenTheme" to your main activity.Third, Update your theme in your onCreate() launch activity.UPDATE\nCheck out this post https://plus.google.com/+AndroidDevelopers/posts/Z1Wwainpjhd\nThanks to @mat1h and @adelriosantiagoyour Splash.java may look like this:change ActivityB.class to whichever activity you want to start after the splash screencheck your manifest file and it should look like @Abdullah\'s answer is correct, however Google has posted an extended explanation on how to properly implement this without altering your activity\'s theme:https://plus.google.com/+AndroidDevelopers/posts/Z1WwainpjhdApps like Google Maps and YouTube have started using the same method.The answers above is very good, but I would like to add something else. I am new to Android, I met these problem during my development. hope this can help someone like me.The Splash screen is the entry point of my app, so add the following lines in AndroidManifest.xml.The splash screen should only show once in the app life cycle, I use a boolean variable to record the state of the splash screen, and only show it on the first time.happy coding!Create an Activity SplashScreen.javasplashscreen.xml will be like thisA Splash Screnn, by default, does not automatically make your Application look more professional. A professionally designed Splash Screen has a possibility of making your Application look more professional, but if you do not know how to write one then how professional will the rest of your Application actually be.About the only reason (excuse) to have a Splash Screen is because you are doing a massive amount of Calculations or are waiting for GPS/WiFi to startup because your Application relies on that prior to it starting. Without the result of those Calculations or access to GPS/WiFi (etc.) your Application is dead in the water, thus you feel you need a Splash Screen, and MUST block the view of the Screen for any other running Programs (including the Background).Such a Splash Screen ought to look like your Full Screen Application to give the impression that it has already initialized, then after the lengthy calculations are completed the final details could be filled in (the Image tweaked). The chance of that being the case or that it is the only way the Program could be designed is mighty small.It would be better to allow the User (and the rest of the OS) to do something else while they wait rather than design your Program to be dependant on something that will take a while (when the duration of the wait is uncertain). There are Icons on your Phone already that say that GPS/WiFi is starting. The time or space taken up by the Splash Screen could be spent loading pre-calculations or actually doing the Calculations. See the first Link below for the problems you create and what must be considered.If you absolutely must wait for these Calculations or GPS/WiFi it would be best to simply let the Application start and have a pop-up that says that it is necessary to wait for the Calculations (a TEXTUAL "Initializing" Message is fine). The wait for GPS/WiFi is expected (if they were not enabled in another Program already) so announcing their wait times are unnecessary.Remember that when the Splash Screen starts your Program IS actually running already, all you are doing is delaying the use of your Program and hogging the CPU/GPU to do something that most do not feel is necessary. We had better really want to wait and see your Splash Screen every time we start your Program or WE will not feel it is very professionally written. Making the Splash Screen FULL Screen and a duplicate of the actual Program\'s Screen (so we think it is initialized when in fact it has not) MIGHT accomplish your goal (of making your Program look more professional) but I would not bet much on that.Why not to do it: http://cyrilmottier.com/2012/05/03/splash-screens-are-evil-dont-use-them/How to do it: https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Android+splash+screen+sourceSo there is a good reason not to do it but IF you are certain that somehow your situation falls outside those examples then the means to do it is given above. Be certain that it really does make your Application look more professional or you have defeated the only reason you gave for doing this.It is like a YouTube Channel that starts every Video with a lengthy Graphic Intro (and Outro) or feels the need to tell a Joke or explain what happened during the past week (when it is not a Comedy or LifeStyles Channel). Just show the show ! (Just run the Program).Above all answers are really very good. But there are encounter problem of memory leakage.\nThis issue is often known in the Android community as "Leaking an Activity". Now what exactly does that mean?When configuration change occurs, such as orientation change, Android destroys the Activity and recreates it. Normally, the Garbage Collector will just clear the allocated memory of the old Activity instance and we\'re all good."Leaking an Activity" refers to the situation where the Garbage Collector cannot clear the allocated memory of the old Activity instance since it\'s being (strong) referenced from an object that out lived the Activity instance. Every Android app has a specific amount of memory allocated for it. When Garbage Collector cannot free up unused memory, the app\'s performance will decrease gradually and eventually crash with OutOfMemory error.How to determine whether the app leaks memory or not? The fastest way is to open the Memory tab in Android Studio and pay attention to allocated memory as you change the orientation.\nIf the allocated memory keeps on increasing and never decreases then you have a memory leak.1.Memory leak when user change the orientation.\nFirst you need to define the splash screen in your layout resource splashscreen.xml fileSample Code for splash screen activity.For  more information please go through this linkAbdullah\'s answer is great. But i want to add some more details to it with my answer.Implementing a Splash ScreenImplementing a splash screen the right way is a little different than you might imagine. The splash view that you see has to be ready immediately, even before you can inflate a layout file in your splash activity.So you will not use a layout file. Instead, specify your splash screen\xe2\x80\x99s background as the activity\xe2\x80\x99s theme background. To do this, first create an XML drawable in res/drawable.background_splash.xmlIt just a layerlist with logo in center background color with it.Now open styles.xml and add this styleThis theme will have to actionbar and with background that we just created above.And in manifest you need to set SplashTheme to activity that you want to use as splash.Then inside your activity code navigate user to the specific screen after splash using intent.That\'s the right way to do. I used these references for answer.This is the full code hereSplashActivity.javaIn drawables create this bg_splash.xmlIn styles.xml create a custom themeand finally in AndroidManifest.xml specify the theme to your activityCheers.Splash screens should not be loaded from a layout file, there might still be some lag when loading it.The best way is to create a Theme just for your SplashScreenActivity and set the android:windowBackground to a drawable ressource.https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/splash-screens-the-right-way/In a nutshell:Declare your SplashScreenActivity in the manifest:In your SplashScreenActivity.java:Next create the ressource for the background window of your theme:Drawable file splash.xml:Splash screen example :Splash screen is a little unusable object in Android: it can not be loaded as soon as possible for hiding the delay of main activity starting. There are two reasons to use it: advertising and network operations. Implementation as dialog makes jump without delay from splash screen to main UI of activity.Layout:And start:After Android Marshmallow, other Productive use of Splash screen I come to think of is requesting necessary Android Permissions in your app\'s splash screen. it seems like most apps handle permission request this way.Dialogs make bad UIX and they break the main flow and make you decide on runtime and truth is most users might not even care if your app want to write something on SD card. Some of them might not even understand what we are trying to convey until we translate it in plain english.Requesting permissions at one time make less number of "if else" before every operation and make your code looks clutter free.This is a example of how you can ask for permissions in your splash activity for device running Android OS 23+ . If all permissions are granted OR already granted OR app is running on Pre Marshmallow THEN just go and display main contents with little delay of half second so that user can appreciate effort we had put in reading this question and trying to give our best.Create a Activity, let us Activity named \'A\', then create a xml file called myscreen.xml, in that set a the splash screen image as background, and then use count down timer to navigate from one Activtity to another. To know how to use Count Down timer see my answer in this question TimerTask in Android?How about a super-flexible launch screen that can use the same code and is defined in the AndroidManifest.xml, so the code will never need to change. I generally develop libraries of code and do not like customizing code because it is sloppy.Then the SpashActivity itself looks up the meta-data for "launch_class" to then make the Intent itself. The meta data "duration" defines how long the splash screen stays up.you will not use a layout file. Instead, specify your splash screen\xe2\x80\x99s background as the activity\xe2\x80\x99s theme background. To do this, first create an XML drawable in res/drawable.Note: all code below is available GitHub LinkHere, I\xe2\x80\x99ve set up a background color and an image.Next, you will set this as your splash activity\xe2\x80\x99s background in the theme. Navigate to your styles.xml file and add a new theme for your splash activity:In your new SplashTheme, set the window background attribute to your XML drawable. Configure this as your splash activity\xe2\x80\x99s theme in your AndroidManifest.xml:Finally, your SplashActivity class should just forward you along to your main activity:Notice that you don\xe2\x80\x99t even set up a view for this SplashActivity. The view comes from the theme. When you set up the UI for your splash activity in the theme, it is available immediately.If you did have a layout file for your splash activity, that layout file would be visible to the user only after your app has been fully initialized, which is too late. You want the splash to be displayed only in that small amount of time before the app is initialized.Another approach is achieved by using CountDownTimerSometime user open the SplashActivity and quit immediately but the app still go to MainActivity after SPLASH_SCREEN_DISPLAY_LENGTH.For prevent it: In SplashActivity you should check the SplashActivity is finishing or not before move to MainActivityHope this helpThough there are good answers, I will show the google recommended way:1)First create a Theme for splash screen:\n you have a theme called splashscreenTheme, your launcher theme would be:Note: android:windowBackground already sets your splashscreen image no\n    need to do this in UI again.you can also use color here instead of a drawable.2)Set the theme to manifest of splashscreenActivity3)make sure you launch_screen drawable is not in drawable folder if your image is not small.It will result in faster launch screen start and save you from the black screenIt also avoids extra overdrawThis is the best post I\'ve seen on splash screens: http://saulmm.github.io/avoding-android-cold-startsSa\xc3\xbal Molinero goes into two different options for splash screens: Taking advantage of the window background to animate into your initial screen and displaying placeholder UI (which is a popular choice that Google uses for most of their apps these days).I refer to this post every time I need to consider cold start time and avoiding user dropoff due to long startup times.Hope this helps!Simple Code, it works:) Simple splashThe Stopping on the Splash screen for 4\'s 5\'s unnecessarily doesn\'t make much sense.\nIt\'s Ok if you loading something in background else follow this approach to implement splash screen:- \nImplementing a splash screen the right way is a little different than you might imagine.
