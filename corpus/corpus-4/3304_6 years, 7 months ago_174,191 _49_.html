What is the diffirence between the @id/ and @+id/?In @+id/ the plus symbol + instructs to create a new resource name and add in to the R.java file but what about @id/? From the documentation of ID: when referencing an Android resource ID, you do not need the plus symbol, but must add the android package namespace, like so:But in the image below Eclipse doesn\'t suggest any kind of @android:id/.Are @id/ and @android:id/ the same? you refer to Android resources , which are already defined in Android system, with @android:id/.. while to access resources that you have defined/created in your project, you use @id/..More InfoAs per your clarifications in the chat, you said you have a problem like this :If we use android:id="@id/layout_item_id" it doesn\'t work.  Instead @+id/ works so what\'s the difference here?  And that was my original question.Well, it depends on the context, when you\'re using the XML attribute of android:id, then you\'re specifying a new id, and are instructing the parser (or call it the builder) to create a new entry in R.java, thus you have to include a + sign.While in the other case, like android:layout_below="@id/myTextView" , you\'re referring to an id that has already been created, so parser links this to the already created id in R.java.More Info AgainAs you said in your chat, note that android:layout_below="@id/myTextView" won\'t recognize an element with id myTextViewif it is written after the element you\'re using it in.the + sign is a short cut to add the id to your list of resource ids.  Otherwise you need to have them in a xml file like thisSometimes you see references in your layout files like:<listview id="@+id/android:list">and<listview id="@android:id/list">What\'s the difference?.. I\'m glad you asked \xe2\x98\xba@+id/foo means you are creating an id named foo in the namespace of your application.\nYou can refer to it using @id/foo.\n@android:id/foo means you are referring to an id defined in the android namespace.The \'+\' means to create the symbol if it doesn\'t already exist. You don\'t need it (and shouldn\'t use it) when referencing android: symbols, because those are already defined for you by the platform and you can\'t make your own in that namespace anyway.This namespace is the namespace of the framework.\nfor example, you need to use @android:id/list because this the id the framework expects to find.. (the framework knows only about the ids in the android namespace.) Completely copied from this sourceIn Short+id    Plus sign tells android to add or create a new id in Resources. while it just help to refer the already generated id..The plus sign (+) before the resource type is needed only when you\'re defining a resource ID for the first time. When you compile the app, the SDK tools use the ID name to create a new resource ID in your project\'s R.java file that refers to the EditText element. With the resource ID declared once this way, other references to the ID do not need the plus sign. Using the plus sign is necessary only when specifying a new resource ID and not needed for concrete resources such as strings or layouts. See the sidebox for more information about resource objects.From: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui.htmlThere\'s a bug with Eclipse where sometimes if you just created a new @+id/.., it won\'t be added immediately to the R.java file, even after clean-building the project. The solution is to restart Eclipse.This I think should be solved as soon as possible, because it may (and from experience, will) confuse some developers into thinking that there\'s something wrong with their syntax, and try to debug it even if there\'s really nothing to debug.@id/ and @android:id/ is not the same.@id/ referencing ID in your application, @android:id/ referencing an item in Android platform.Eclipse is wrong.From the Developer Guide:The at-symbol (@) at the beginning of the string indicates that the XML parser should parse and expand the rest of the ID string and identify it as an ID resource. The plus-symbol (+) means that this is a new resource name that must be created and added to our resources (in the R.java file). There are a number of other ID resources that are offered by the Android framework. When referencing an Android resource ID, you do not need the plus-symbol, but must add the android package namespace, like so:android:id="@android:id/empty"Android uses some files called resources where values are stored for the XML files.Now when you use @id/ for an XML object, It is trying to refer to an id which is already registered in the values files. On the other hand, when you use @+id/ it registers a new id in the values files as implied by the \'+\' symbol.Hope this helps :).If the view item performs the same operation, you can use the @+id for each entry in any layout because during compilation of multiple @+id/foo the R.java file only creates one enumeration.  So for example if I have a save button on each page that performs the same operation, I use android:id="@+id/button_save" in each layout.  The R.java file only has one entry for the button_save.Difference between \xe2\x80\x9c@+id/\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c@id/\xe2\x80\x9d in AndroidThe first one is used for to create the id of the particular ui component and the another one is used for to refer the particular componentFor the ID value, you should usually use this syntax form: "@+id/name". The plus symbol, +, indicates that this is a new resource ID and the aapt tool will create a new resource integer in the R.java class, if it doesn\'t already exist. For example:The nameTextbox name is now a resource ID attached to this element. You can then refer to the TextView to which the ID is associated in Java:This code returns the TextView object.However, if you have already defined an ID resource (and it is not already used), then you can apply that ID to a View element by excluding the plus symbol in the android:id value.Source: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/layout-resource.html#idvalue
