I am using a table with alternate row color with this.Here I am using class for tr, but I want to use only for table. When I use class for table than this apply on tr alternative.Can I write my HTML like this using CSS?How can I make the rows have "zebra stripes" using CSS?There is a CSS selector, really a pseudo-selector, called nth-child. In pure CSS you can do the following:Note: No support in IE 8.Or, if you have jQuery:You have the :nth-child() pseudo-class:In the early days of :nth-child() its browser support was kind of poor. That\'s why setting class="odd" became such a common technique. In late 2013 I\'m glad to say that IE6 and IE7 are finally dead (or sick enough to stop caring) but IE8 is still around\xe2\x80\x94thankfully, it\'s the only exception.Just add the following to your html code (withing the <head>) and you are done.HTML:Easier and faster than jQuery examples.can i write my html like this with use\n  css ?Yes you can but then you will have to use the :nth-child() pseudo selector (which has limited support though):Most of the above codes won\'t work with IE version. The solution that works for IE+ other browsers is this. You can use nth-child(odd/even) selectors however not all browsers (ie 6-8, ff v3.0) support these rules hence why most solutions fall back to some form of javascript/jquery solution to add the classes to the rows for these non compliant browsers to get the tiger stripe effect.There is a fairly easy way to do this in PHP, if I understand your query, I assume that you code in PHP and you are using CSS and javascript to enhance the output.The dynamic output from the database will carry a for loop to iterate through results which are then loaded into the table. Just add a function call to the  like this: then add the function to the page or library file:}Now this will alternate dynamically between colors at each newly generated table row.It\'s a lot easier than messing about with CSS that doesn\'t work on all browsers.Hope this helps.We can use odd and even CSS rules and jQuery method for alternate row colorsUsing CSSUsing jQuery
