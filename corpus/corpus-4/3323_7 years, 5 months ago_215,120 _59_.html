How can I take a screenshot of a selected area of phone-screen not by any program but from code?Here is the code that allowed my screenshot to be stored on an SD card and used later for whatever your needs are:First, you need to add a proper permission to save the file:And this is the code (running in an Activity):And this is how you can open the recently generated image:If you want to use this on fragment view then use:instead ofon takeScreenshot() functionCall this method, passing in the outer most ViewGroup that you want a screen shot of:Note: works only for rooted phoneProgrammatically, you can run adb shell /system/bin/screencap -p /sdcard/img.png as belowthen read img.png as Bitmap and use as your wish.EDIT: have mercy with the downvotes. It was true in 2010 when I answered the question.All the programs which allow screenshots work only on rooted phones.Mualig answer is very good, but I had the same problem Ewoks describes, I\'m not getting the background. So sometimes is good enough and sometimes I get black text over black background (depending on the theme).This solution is heavily based in Mualig code and the code I\'ve found in Robotium. I\'m discarding the use of drawing cache by calling directly to the draw method. Before that I\'ll try to get the background drawable from current activity to draw it first.No root permission or no big coding is required for this method.On adb shell using below command you can take screen shot.This command does not required any root permission so same you can perform from java code of android application also.More about keyevent code in android see http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.htmlHere we have used.  KEYCODE_SYSRQ its value is 120 and used for System Request / Print Screen key.  As CJBS said, The output picture will be saved in /sdcard/Pictures/ScreenshotsAs a reference, one way to capture the screen (and not just your app activity) is to capture the framebuffer (device /dev/graphics/fb0). To do this you must either have root privileges or your app must be an app with signature permissions ("A permission that the system grants only if the requesting application is signed with the same certificate as the application that declared the permission") - which is very unlikely unless you compiled your own ROM.Each framebuffer capture, from a couple of devices I have tested, contained exactly one screenshot. People have reported it to contain more, I guess it depends on the frame/display size.I tried to read the framebuffer continuously but it seems to return for a fixed amount of bytes read. In my case that is (3 410 432) bytes, which is enough to store a display frame of 854*480 RGBA (3 279 360 bytes). Yes, the frame, in binary, outputted from fb0 is RGBA in my device. This will most likely depend from device to device. This will be important for you to decode it =)In my device /dev/graphics/fb0 permissions are so that only root and users from group graphics can read the fb0. graphics is a restricted group so you will probably only access fb0 with a rooted phone using su command.Android apps have the user id (uid) = app_## and group id (guid) = app_## .adb shell has uid = shell and guid = shell, which has much more permissions than an app. You can actually check those permissions at /system/permissions/platform.xmlThis means you will be able to read fb0 in the adb shell without root but you will not read it within the app without root.Also, giving READ_FRAME_BUFFER and/or ACCESS_SURFACE_FLINGER permissions on AndroidManifest.xml will do nothing for a regular app because these will only work for \'signature\' apps.Also check this closed thread for more details.You can try the following library:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/android-screenshot-library/\nAndroid Screenshot Library (ASL) enables to programmatically capture screenshots from Android devices without requirement of having root access privileges. Instead, ASL utilizes a native service running in the background, started via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) once per device boot.My solution is:andImages are saved in the external storage folder.You can try to do something like this,Getting a bitmap cache from a layout or a view by doing something like\nFirst you gotta setDrawingCacheEnabled to a layout(a linearlayout or relativelayout, or a view)then Then you do whatever you want with the bitmap. Either turning it into an image file, or send the bitmap\'s uri to somewhere else.ADD PERMISSIONFor those who want to capture a GLSurfaceView, the getDrawingCache or drawing to canvas method won\'t work.You have to read the content of the OpenGL framebuffer after the frame has been rendered. There is a good answer here Based on the answer of @JustinMorris above and @NiravDangi here https://stackoverflow.com/a/8504958/2232148 we must take the background and foreground of a view and assemble them like this:The quality parameter takes a constant of Bitmap.Config, typically either Bitmap.Config.RGB_565 or Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888.I have created a simple library that takes a screenshot from a View and either gives you a Bitmap object or saves it directly to any path you wanthttps://github.com/abdallahalaraby/BlinkIf you want to take screenshot from fragment  than follow this:Override  onCreateView(): Logic for taking screenshot:method shareScreenShotM)():method takeScreenShot():method savePic():For activity you can simply use View v1 = getWindow().getDecorView().getRootView(); instead of mViewAlong with capturing screenshot,if we want to play the tone also.We can use following codeJust extending taraloca\'s answer. You must add followings lines to make it work. I have made the image name static. Please ensure you use taraloca\'s timestamp variable incase you need dynamic image name.And in the AndroidManifest.xml file following entries are must:if you want to capture a view or layout like RelativeLayout or LinearLayout etc.\njust use the code : now you can save this bitmap on device storage by :
