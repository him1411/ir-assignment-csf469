I am trying to access connectionStrings from the config file. The code is ASP.NET + C#. I have added System.Configuration to reference and also mentioned with using. But still it wouldn\'t accept the assembly.I am using VSTS 2008. Any idea what could be the reason? Another weird thing is the assembly name shown as "System.configuration", a lower case c which is not how names are displayed for other System assemblies.Config:It\'s not only necessary to use the namespace System.Configuration. You have also to add the reference to the assembly System.Configuration.dll , by right-click-ing on the References tab, choose add reference and then find System.Configuration. This will work for sure.\nAlso for the NameValueCollection you have to write:In your project, right-click, Add Reference..., in the .NET tab, find the System.Configuration component name and click OK.using System.Configuration tells the compiler/IntelliSense to search in that namespace for any classes you use. Otherwise, you would have to use the full name (System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager) every time. But if you don\'t add the reference, that namespace/class will not be found anywhere.Note that a DLL can have any namespace, so the file System.Configuration.dll could, in theory, have the namespace Some.Random.Name. For clarity/consistency they\'re usually the same, but there are exceptions.Ok.. it worked after restarting the VSTS. The link suggested the solution for the same problem. Wish i could have seen it before. :)I have gotten a better solution for the issue configurationmanager does not exist in the current context. To a read connection string from web.config we need to use ConfigurationManager class and its method. If you want to use you need to add namespace using System.Configuration;Though you used this namespace, when you try to use the ConfigurationManager class then the system shows an error \xe2\x80\x9cconfigurationmanager does not exist in the current context\xe2\x80\x9d.\nTo solve this Problem:If you\'re getting a lot of warnings (in my case 64 in a solution!) likeCS0618: \'ConfigurationSettings.AppSettings\' is obsolete: \'This method is obsolete, it has been replaced by System.Configuration!System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings\'because you\'re upgrading an older project you can save a lot of time as follows:Add the following two using statements to the top of each class (.cs) file:using System.Configuration; \n using ConfigurationSettings = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager;By this change all occurances of will now reference the right configuration manager, no longer the deprecated one, and all the CS0618 warnings will go away immediately.Of course, keep in mind that this is a quick hack. On the long term, you should consider refactoring the code.Are you sure you have added a reference to the .NET assembly and not something else? I\'d remove your reference and then try re-adding it, making sure you select from the .NET tab in Visual Studio reference dialogue - the latest version should be 2.0.0.0 in GAC.For a sanity check, try creating a new Web Application Project, open the code behind for the Default.aspx page. Add a line in Page_Load to access your connection string.It should have System.Configuration added as reference by default. You should also see the using statement at the top of your code file already.My code behind file now looks like this and compiles with no problems.This assumes I have a connection string in my web.config with a name equal to "MyConnectionStringName" like so...Yeah, it\'s elementary I know. But if you don\'t have any better ideas sometimes it helps to check against something really simple that you know should work.If this code is on a separate project, like a library project.\nDon\'t forgeet to add reference to system.configuration.You may also get this error if you add a reference to a different, unrelated project by mistake.  Check if that applies to you.To Solve this problem go to Solution Explorer And right click reference and click add reference and chose .net and find system.configuration select an click ok
