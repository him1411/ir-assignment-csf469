How do you convert a jQuery object into a string?I assume you\'re asking for the full HTML string. If that\'s the case, something like this will do the trick:This is explained in more depth here, but essentially you make a new node to wrap the item of interest, do the manipulations, remove it, and grab the HTML.If you\'re just after a string representation, then go with new String(obj).I wrote the original answer in 2009. As of 2014, most major browsers now support outerHTML as a native property (see, for example, Firefox and InternetÂ Explorer), so you can do:With jQuery 1.6, this seems to be a more elegant solution:Just use .get(0) to grab the native element, and get its outerHTML property:Can you be a little more specific? If you\'re trying to get the HTML inside of a tag you can do something like this:HTML snippet:jQuery:The best way to find out what properties and methods are available to an HTML node (object) is to do something like:From jQuery 1.6+ you can just use outerHTML to include the HTML tags in your string output:jQuery is up in here, so:Return all that HTML stuff:This seems to work fine for me:No need to clone and add to the DOM to use .html(), you can do:The accepted answer doesn\'t cover text nodes (undefined is printed out).This code snippet solves it:It may be possible to use the jQuery.makeArray(obj) utility function:   If you want to stringify an HTML element in order to pass it somewhere and parse it back to an element try by creating a unique query for the element:thanIf you want to serialize the whole object to string, use JSON.
