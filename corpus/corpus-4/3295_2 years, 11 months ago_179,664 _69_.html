I\'ve seen in the new material design Side Nav spec that you can display the drawer over the action bar and behind the status bar. How can I implement this?New functionality in the framework and support libs allow exactly this. There are three \'pieces of the puzzle\':I\'ll assume that you will use the new appcompat.First, your layout should look like this:Then in your Activity/Fragment:Then you need to make sure that the DrawerLayout is visible behind the status bar. You do that by changing your values-v21 theme:values-v21/themes.xmlNote:\nIf a <fragment android:name="fragments.NavigationDrawerFragment"> is used instead ofthe actual layout, the desired effect will be achieved if you call fitsSystemWindows(boolean) on a view that you return from onCreateView method.This can now be achieved using the new Android Design Support Library.You can see the Cheesesquare sample app by Chris Banes which demos all the new features.Since there is no complete solution posted, here is the way I achieved the desired result.First include a ScrimInsetsFrameLayout in your project.Then create a styleable so that the insetForeground can be set.values/attrs.xmlUpdate your activity\'s xml file and make sure android:fitsSystemWindows is set to true on both the DrawerLayout as well as the ScrimInsetsFrameLayout.layout/activity_main.xmlInside the onCreate method of your activity set the status bar background color on the drawer layout.MainActivity.javaFinally update your app\'s theme so that the DrawerLayout is behind the status bar.values-v21/styles.xmlResult:With the release of the latest Android Support Library (rev 22.2.0) we\'ve got a Design Support Library and as part of this a new view called NavigationView. So instead of doing everything on our own with the ScrimInsetsFrameLayout and all the other stuff we simply use this view and everything is done for us.Add the Design Support Library to your build.gradle fileAdd the NavigationView to your DrawerLayout:Create a new menu-resource in /res/menu and add the items and icons you wanna display:Init the NavigationView and handle click events:Be sure to set android:windowDrawsSystemBarBackgrounds and android:statusBarColor in values-v21 otherwise your Drawer won`t be displayed "under" the StatusBarAdd a Header to the NavigationView. For this simply create a new layout and add app:headerLayout="@layout/my_header_layout" to the NavigationView.You can also check the example app by Chris Banes which highlights the NavigationView along with the other new views that are part of the Design Support Library (like the FloatingActionButton, TextInputLayout, Snackbar, TabLayout etc.)Make it work, in values-v21 styles or theme xml needs to use this attribute:<item name="android:windowTranslucentStatus">true</item>That make the magic!The above all approaches are correct and may be working . I have created a working demo following the above guide and tested on 2.x to 5.x You can clone from GithubThe important thing to play around is in Main Activity and the call back Absolutely the Theme for V21 does the magic and the ScrimInsetsFrameLayoutNow this come more easy with new Design Support library clone from @Chris Banes\nhttps://github.com/chrisbanes/cheesesquareAll answers mentioned here are too old and lengthy.The best and short solution that work with latest Navigationview isthis is going to change your status bar color to transparent when you open the drawerNow when you close the drawer you need to change status bar color again to dark.So you can do it in this way.and then in main layout add a single line i.eand your drawer layout will look likeand your navigation view will look likeI have tested it and its fully working.Hope it helps someone.This may not be the best approach but it works smoothly and is simple to implement.\nMark it up if it helps.Happy coding :)I am Using Design Support Library. And just by using custom theme I achived transparent Status Bar when Opened Navigation Drawer.Finally add theme in Manifest FileDo not forget to use the property, android:fitsSystemWindows="true" in "DrawerLayout"This is the most simple, and it worked for me:In the values-21:In the values:And set to your toolbarInstead of using the ScrimInsetsFrameLayout... Isn\'t it easier to just add a view with a fixed height of 24dp and a background of primaryColor?I understand that this involves adding a dummy view in the hierarchy, but it seems cleaner to me.I already tried it and it\'s working well.Try with this: style :Main Activity extends ActionBarActivityNow you can onCreateOptionsMenu like as normal ActionBar with ToolBar.This is my Layout Hope you understand !have fun !
