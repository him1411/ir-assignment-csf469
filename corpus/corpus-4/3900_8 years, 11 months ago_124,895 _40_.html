When logging in C#, how can I learn the name of the method that called the current method? I know all about System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod(), but I want to go one step beneath this in the stack trace. I\'ve considered parsing the stack trace, but I am hoping to find a cleaner more explicit way, something like Assembly.GetCallingAssembly() but for methods.Try this:It is from Get Calling Method using Reflection [C#].In C# 5 you can get that information using caller info:You can also get the [CallerFilePath] and [CallerLineNumber].In general, you can use the System.Diagnostics.StackTrace class to get a System.Diagnostics.StackFrame, and then use the GetMethod() method to get a System.Reflection.MethodBase object. However, there are some caveats to this approach:(NOTE: I am just expanding on the answer provided by Firas Assad.)As suggested in a comment, you can use Caller Information and optional parameterswhich this test illustratesWhile the StackTrace works quite fast above and would not be a performance issue in most cases the Caller Information is much faster still.  In a sample of 1000 iterations, I clocked it as 40 times faster.We can improve on Mr Assad\'s code (the current accepted answer) just a little bit by instantiating only the frame we actually need rather than the entire stack:This might perform a little better, though in all likelihood it still has to use the full stack to create that single frame.  Also, it still has the same caveats that Alex Lyman pointed out (optimizer/native code might corrupt the results). Finally, you might want to check to be sure that new StackFrame(1) or .GetFrame(1) don\'t return null, as unlikely as that possibility might seem.See this related question:\nCan you use reflection to find the name of the currently executing method?A quick recap of the 2 approaches with speed comparison being the important part.http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/archive/2013/07/25/c.net-little-wonders-getting-caller-information.aspxDetermining the caller at compile-timeDetermining the caller using the stackComparison of the 2 approachesSo you see, using the attributes is much, much faster!  Nearly 25x\n  faster in fact.Note that doing so will be unreliable in release code, due to optimization. Additionally, running the application in sandbox mode (network share) won\'t allow you to grab the stack frame at all.Consider aspect-oriented programming (AOP), like PostSharp, which instead of being called from your code, modifies your code, and thus knows where it is at all times.Maybe you are looking for something like this:Obviously this is a late answer, but I have a better option if you can use .NET 4.5 or more:This will print the current Date and Time, followed by "Namespace.ClassName.MethodName" and ending with ": text".\nSample output:Sample use:A fantastic class is here: http://www.csharp411.com/c-get-calling-method/You can now use the Caller Info Attributes:CallerMemberName - Member that called the function.Another approach I have used is to add a parameter to the method in question. For example, instead of void Foo(), use void Foo(string context). Then pass in some unique string that indicates the calling context.If you only need the caller/context for development, you can remove the param before shipping.Take a look at Logging method name in .NET. Beware of using it in production code. StackFrame may not be reliable...We can also use lambda\'s in order to find the caller.Suppose you have a method defined by you:and you want to find it\'s caller.1.   Change the method signature so we have a parameter of type Action (Func will also work):2. Lambda names are not generated randomly. The rule seems to be: > <CallerMethodName>__X\nwhere CallerMethodName is replaced by the previous function and X is an index.3. When we call MethodA the Action/Func parameter has to be generated by the caller method.\nExample:4. Inside MethodA we can now call the helper function defined above and find the MethodInfo of the caller method.Example:will be enough, I think.
