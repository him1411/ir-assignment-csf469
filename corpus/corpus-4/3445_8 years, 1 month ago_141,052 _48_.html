I open several files in Vim by, for example, runningwhich opens 23 files.I then make my edit and run the following twicewhich closes all my buffers.How can you close only one buffer in Vim?A word of caution: "w does not stand for write but for wipeout!" More from manuals::bdUnload buffer [N] (default: current\n  buffer) and delete it from\n                  the buffer list.  If the buffer was changed, this fails,\n                  unless when [!] is specified, in which case changes are\n  lost.\n                  The file remains unaffected.If you know what you\'re doing, you can also use :bw:bwLike |:bdelete|, but really delete the\n  buffer.If this isn\'t made obvious by the the previous answers::bd will close the current buffer.  If you don\'t want to grab the buffer list.Check your buffer id using \n:buffersyou will see list of buffers there like if you want to remove b.php from bufferif you want to remove/close all from buffersRather than browse the ouput of the :ls command and delete (unload, wipe..) a buffer by specifying its number, I find that using file names is often more effective.For instance, after I opened a couple of .txt file to refresh my memories of some fine point.. copy and paste a few lines of text to use as a template of sorts.. etc. I  would type the following:Note that the matching string does not have to be at the start of the file name.The above displays the list of file names that match \'txt\' at the bottom of the screen and keeps the :bd command I initially typed untouched, ready to be completed.Here\'s an example:I could backspace over the \'txt\' bit and type in the file name I wish to delete, but where this becomes really convenient is that I don\'t have to: if I hit the Tab key a second time, Vim automatically completes my command with the first match:If I want to get rid of this particular buffer I just need to hit Enter.And if the buffer I want to delete happens to be the second (third.. etc.) match, I only need to keep hitting the Tab key to make my :bd command cycle through the list of matches.Naturally, this method can also be used to switch to a given buffer via such commands as :b.. :sb.. etc.This approach is particularly useful when the \'hidden\' Vim option is set, because the buffer list can quickly become quite large, covering several screens, and making it difficult to spot the particular buffer I am looking for. To make the most of this feature, it\'s probably best to read the following Vim help file and tweak the behavior of Tab command-line completion accordingly so that it best suits your workflow:The behavior I described above results from the following setting, which I chose for consistency\'s sake in order to emulate bash completion:As opposed to using buffer numbers, the merit of this approach is that I usually remember at least part of a given file name letting me target the buffer directly rather than having to first look up its number via the :ls command.Use:Examples:to delete buffer 2:You can map next and previous to function keys too, making cycling through buffers a breezefrom my vimrcHow aboutThat way you can edit a single file on your left and navigate the whole dir on your right...\nJust a thought, not the solution...[EDIT: this was a stupid suggestion from a time I did not know Vim well enough. Please don\'t use tabs instead of buffers; tabs are Vim\'s "window layouts"]Maybe switch to using tabs?vim -p a/*.php opens the same files in tabsgt and gT switch tabs back and forth:q closes only the current tab:qa closes everything and exits:tabo closes everything but the current tabThose using a buffer or tree navigation plugin, like Buffergator or NERDTree, will need to toggle these splits before destroying the current buffer - else you\'ll send your splits into wonkyvilleI use:Where  "NERDTreeToggle" in that list is the same as typing :NERDTreeToggle.  You can modify this function to integrate with your own configuration.
