I\'ve been writing some shell script and I would find it useful if there was the ability to halt the execution of said shell script if any of the commands failed. See below for an example:So in this case if the script can\'t change to the indicated directory then it would certainly not want to do a ./configure afterwards if it fails.Now I\'m well aware that I could have an if check for each command (which I think is a hopeless solution), but is there a global setting to make the script exit if one of the commands fails?Use the set -e builtin:Alternatively, you can pass -e on the command line:You can also disable this behavior with set +e.(*) Note:The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the\n  command list immediately following a while or until keyword,\n  part of the test following the if or elif reserved words, part\n  of any command executed in a && or || list except the command\n  following the final && or ||, any command in a pipeline but\n  the last, or if the command\'s return value is being inverted with\n  !(from man bash)To exit the script as soon as one of the commands failed, add this at the beginning:This causes the script to exit immediately when some command that is not part of some test (like in a if [ ... ] condition or a && construct) exits with a non-zero exit code.Here is how to do it:One idiom is:I realize that can get long, but for larger scripts you could break it into logical functions.I think that what you are looking for is the trap command:For more information, see this page.Another option is to use the set -e command at the top of your script - it will make the script exit if any program / command returns a non true value.An alternative to the accepted answer that fits in the first line:In case script is calling subscript inside, the pipefail option can be useful.  -e (errexit): Abort script at first error, when a command exits with non-zero status (except in until or while loops, if-tests, list constructs)-o pipefail: Causes a pipeline to return the exit status of the last command in the pipe that returned a non-zero return value.Chapter 33.
