I have a column containing urls (id, url):I\'d like to change the word "updates" to "news". Is it possible to do this with a script?http://www.electrictoolbox.com/mysql-find-replace-text/Yes, MySQL has a REPLACE() function:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-functions.html#function_replaceNote that it\'s easier if you make that an alias when using SELECT The replace function should work for you.Returns the string str with all occurrences of the string from_str replaced by the string to_str. REPLACE() performs a case-sensitive match when searching for from_str. In addition to gmaggio\'s answer if you need to dynamically REPLACE and UPDATE according to another column you can do for example:In my example the string articles/news/ is stored in other_table t2 and there is no need to use LIKE in the WHERE clause.
