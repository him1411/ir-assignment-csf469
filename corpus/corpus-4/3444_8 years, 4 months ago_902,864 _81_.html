I\'ve got fresh install of Apache 2.2 on my Vista machine, everything works fine, except mod rewrite.I\'ve uncommented but none of my rewrite rules works, even simple ones like All the rules I\'m using are working on my hosting, so they should be ok, so my question is, is there any hidden thing in apache configuration, that could block mod rewrite?In order to use mod_rewrite you can type the following command in the terminal:Restart apache2 afteroror as per new unified System Control WayThen, if you\'d like, you can use the following .htaccess file.The above .htaccess file (if placed in your DocumentRoot) will redirect all traffic to an index.php file in the DocumentRoot unless the file exists.So, let\'s say you have the following directory structure and httpdocs is the DocumentRootAny file that exists in httpdocs will be served to the requester using the .htaccess shown above, however, everything else will be redirected to httpdocs/index.php. Your application files in includes/app will not be accessible.For my situation, I had RewriteEngine Onin my .htaccess, along with the module being loaded, and it was not working.The solution to my problem was to edit my vhost entry to inlcude AllowOverride allin the <Directory> section for the site in question.I\'ve written about this in a article:\nhttp://www.jarrodoberto.com/articles/2011/11/enabling-mod-rewrite-on-ubuntuTry setting: AllowOverride All. Second most common issue is not having mod rewrite enabled: a2enmod rewrite and then restart apache.If non of the above works try editing /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-defaultalmost at the top you will findChange the AllowOverride None to AllowOverride Allthis worked for meIn Ubuntu:Run:and then:mod_rewrite will now be enabled!There are many ways how you can fix this issue, if you know the root of the issue.Problem 1Firstly, it may be a problem with your apache not having the mod_rewrite.c module installed or enabled. For this reason, you would have to  enable it as followsOpen up your console and type into it, this: sudo a2enmod rewriteRestart your apache server.service apache2 restartProblem 2You may also, in addition to the above, if it does not work, have to change the override rule from the apache conf file (either apache2.conf, http.conf , or 000-default file).Locate "Directory /var/www/"Change the "Override None" to "Override All"Problem 3If you get an error stating rewrite module is not found, then probably your userdir module \nis not enabled. For this reason you need to enable it. Type this into the console:sudo a2enmod userdirThen try enabling the rewrite module if still not enabled (as mentioned above).To read further on this, you can visit this site: http://seventhsoulmountain.blogspot.com/2014/02/wordpress-permalink-ubuntu-problem-solutions.htmlOpen  terminal and typin a2enmod rewrite, It will enable your mod_rewrite module for Apache.Then go to /etc/apache2/sites-available and edit default file. (For this you must have writable permissions to this file and sites-available folder.)Replace below with existing lines 4 to 14 Now restart your apache by /etc/init.d/apache2 restart or service apache2 restartTake clean URL test again and this time it will be passed.<edit>Just noticed you said mod_rewrite.s instead of mod_rewrite.so - hope that\'s a typo in your question and not in the httpd.conf file! :)</edit>I\'m more used to using Apache on Linux, but I had to do this the other day. First off, take a look in your Apache install directory. (I\'ll be assuming you installed it to "C:\\Program Files" here)Take a look in the folder: "C:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Apache2.2\\modules" and make sure that there\'s a file called mod_rewrite.so in there. (It should be, it\'s provided as part of the default install.Next, open up "C:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Apache2.2\\conf" and open httpd.conf. Make sure the line:is uncommented:Also, if you want to enable the RewriteEngine by default, you might want to add something like to the end of your httpd.conf file.If not, make sure you specifysomewhere in your .htaccess file.New apache version has change in some way. If your apache version is 2.4 then you have to go to /etc/apache2/. There will be a file named apache2.conf. You have to edit that one(you should have root permission). Change directory text like thisNow restart apache.Hope it works.I just did this then you have to restart the apache service by following commandThere\'s obviously more than one way to do it, but I would suggest using the more standard:The first time I struggled with mod_rewrite rules ignoring my traffic, I learned (frustratingly) that I had placed them in the wrong <VirtualHost>, which meant that my traffic would ignore all of them no matter how well-written they were. Make sure this isn\'t happening to you:# Change the log location to suit your system.\nRewriteLog /var/log/apache-rw.log\nRewriteLogLevel 2These parameters will activate if you perform a graceful restart of Apache, so you can recycle them in and closely monitor the mod_rewrite behavior. Once your problem is fixed, turn the RewriteLogLevel back down and celebrate.In 100% of my experience, I\'ve found that the RewriteLog has helped me discover the problem with my rewrite rules. I can\'t recommend this enough. Good luck in your troubleshooting!Also, this bookmark is your best friend:\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritelogWhat worked for me (in ubuntu):Also, as already mentioned, make sure AllowOverride all is set in the relevant section of /etc/apache2/sites-available/defaultI would strongly advise everybody that wants to enable mod_rewrite directives in .htacces files to use AllowOverride FileInfo instead of allowing everything, as ALL the answers on this page suggest. Sad to see all these answers take the as-long-as-it-works-it\'s-okay-approach instead of trying to understand the consequences of the proposed \'solution\'. Try to understand what you are doing on your server and how to limit the privileges you just gave away with AllowOverride All. RTFM!, it is quite clear on the subject. Come on dudes, it\'s no rocketscience, it\'s just a webserver!Old thread, just want to put that don\'t set AllowOverride to all instead use specific mod you want to use,And this line should be un-commentedRefrences
