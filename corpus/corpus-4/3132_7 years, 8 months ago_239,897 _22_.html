Is it possible to run one iteration of logrotate manually without scheduling it on some interval?Yes:  logrotate --force $CONFIG_FILElogrotate -d [your_config_file] invokes debug mode, giving you a verbose description of what would happen, but leaving the log files untouched.  If you want to force-run a single specific directory or daemon\'s log files, you can usually find the configuration in /etc/logrotate.d, and they will work standalone.Keep in mind that global configuration specified in /etc/logrotate.conf will not apply, so if you do this you should ensure you specify all the options you want in the /etc/logrotate.d/[servicename] config file specifically.You can try it out with -d to see what would happen:Then you can run (using nginx as an example):And the nginx logs alone will be rotated.You may want to run it in verbose + force mode.logrotate -vf /etc/logrotate.confThe way to run all of logrotate is:that will run the primary logrotate file, which includes the other logrotate configurations as wellIssue the following command,the way to run specified logrotate:Options:-v :show the process-f :forcing runcustom :user-defined log settingeg:\nmongodb-logCreated a shell script to solve the problem.http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/software/#logrotate_oneThis script will run just the single logrotate sub-configuration file found in "/etc/logrotate.d", but include the global settings from in the global configuration file "/etc/logrotate.conf".   You can also use other otpions for testing it...For example...
