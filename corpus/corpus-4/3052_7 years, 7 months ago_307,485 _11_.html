JQuery, how to call a function every 5 seconds.I\'m looking for a way to automate the changing of images in a slideshow.  I\'d rather not install any other 3rd party plugins if possible.you could register an interval on the page using setInterval, ie:Just a little tip for the first answer. If your function is already defined, reference the function but don\'t call it!!! So don\'t put any parentheses after the function name. Just like:The functions mentioned above execute no matter if it has completed in previous invocation or not, this one runs after every x seconds once the execution is completeBoth setInterval and setTimeout can work for you (as @Doug Neiner and @John Boker wrote both now point to setInterval).\nSee here for some more explanation about both to see which suites you most and how to stop each of them.A good exemple where to subscribe a setInterval(), and use a clearInterval() to stop the forever loop:http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_clearinterval.aspcall this line to stop the loop:you can use window.setInterval and time must to be define in miliseconds, in below case the function will call after every single second (1000 miliseconds)
