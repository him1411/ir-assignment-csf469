I\'m using a UITableView in my iPhone app, and I have a list of people that belong to a group. I would like it so that when the user clicks on a particular person (thus selecting the cell), the cell grows in height to display several UI controls for editing the properties of that person. Is this possible? I found a REALLY SIMPLE solution to this as a side-effect to a UITableView I was working on.....Store the cell height in a variable that reports the original height normally via the tableView: heightForRowAtIndexPath:, then when you want to animate a height change, simply change the value of the variable and call this...You will find it doesn\'t do a full reload but is enough for the UITableView to know it has to redraw the cells, grabbing the new height value for the cell.... and guess what? It ANIMATES the change for you. Sweet.I have a more detailed explanation and full code samples on my blog... Animate UITableView Cell Height ChangeI like the answer by Simon Lee.  I didn\'t actually try that method but it looks like it would change the size of all the cells in the list.  I was hoping for a change of just the cell that is tapped.  I kinda did it like Simon but with just a little difference.  This will change the look of a cell when it is selected.  And it does animate.  Just another way to do it.Create an int to hold a value for the current selected cell index:Then: Then:I am sure you can make similar changes in tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath: to change the type of cell or even load a xib file for the cell.Like this, the currentSelection will start at 0.  You would need to make adjustments if you didn\'t want the first cell of the list (at index 0) to look selected by default.Add a property to keep track of the selected cellSet it to a sentinel value in (for example) viewDidLoad, to make sure that the UITableView starts in the \'normal\' positionIn heightForRowAtIndexPath you can set the height you want for the selected cellIn didSelectRowAtIndexPath you save the current selection and save a dynamic height, if requiredIn didDeselectRowAtIndexPath set the selection index back to the sentinel value and animate the cell back to normal formreloadData is no good because there\'s no animation...This is what I\'m currently trying:It almost works right. Almost. I\'m increasing the height of the cell, and sometimes there\'s a little "hiccup" in the table view as the cell is replaced, as if some scrolling position in the table view is being preserved, the new cell (which is the first cell in the table) ends up with its offset too high, and the scrollview bounces to reposition it.I resolved with reloadRowsAtIndexPaths. I save in didSelectRowAtIndexPath the indexPath of cell selected and call reloadRowsAtIndexPaths at the end (you can send NSMutableArray for list of element\'s you want reload).In heightForRowAtIndexPath you can check if indexPath is in the list or not of expandIndexPath cell\'s and send height.You can check this basic example: \nhttps://github.com/ferminhg/iOS-Examples/tree/master/iOS-UITableView-Cell-Height-Change/celdascambiadetam\nIt\'s a simple solution.i add a sort of code if help youI don\'t know what all this stuff about calling beginUpdates/endUpdates in succession is, you can just use -[UITableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:withAnimation:]. Here is an example project.Try this is for expanding indexwise row:just a note for someone like me searching for add "More Details" on custom cell. Did a excellent work, but don\'t forget to "crop" cell view. \nFrom Interface Builder select your Cell -> Content View -> from Property Inspector select "Clip subview" Swift Version of Simon Lee\'s answer .Then in didSelectRowAtIndexPath() Here is my code of custom UITableView subclass, which expand UITextView at the table cell, without reloading (and lost keyboard focus):I used @Joy\'s awesome answer, and it worked perfectly with ios 8.4 and XCode 7.1.1. In case you are looking to make your cell toggle-able, I changed the -tableViewDidSelect to the following:I hope any of this helped you. Check this method after iOS 7 and later. Improvements have been made to this in iOS 8. We can set it as property of the table view itself.Yes It\'s Possible.UITableView has a delegate method didSelectRowAtIndexPath But in your case if the user scrolls and selects a different cell then u need to have the last selected cell to shrink and expand the currently selected cell reloadRowsAtIndexPaths: calls heightForRowAtIndexPath: so handle accordingly.Heres a shorter version of Simons answer for Swift 3. Also allows for toggling of the cell\'s selectionGet the indexpath of the row selected. Reload the table. In the heightForRowAtIndexPath method of UITableViewDelegate, set the height of the row selected to a different height and for the others return the normal row heightI just resolved this problem with a little hack:When I need to expand the cell height I set isInEdit = YES and call the method [self onTimer] and it animates the cell growth until it reach the s_CellHeightEditing value :-)You can use this method and change return value as you want
