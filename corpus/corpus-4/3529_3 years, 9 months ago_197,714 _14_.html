This variable is a reference to JS event object and can be used to call stopPropagation():PLUNKERAn addition to Stewie\'s answer. In case when your callback decides whether the propagation should be stopped or not, I found it useful to pass the $event object to the callback:And then in the callback itself, you can decide whether the propagation of the event should be stopped:I wrote a directive which lets you limit the areas where a click has effect. It could be used for certain scenarios like this one, so instead of having to deal with the click on a case by case basis you can just say "clicks won\'t come out of this element".You would use it like this:Keep in mind that this would prevent all clicks on the last cell, not just the button.
