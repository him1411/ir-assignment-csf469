It\'s been a while since I\'ve had to adjust project build settings. After upgrading to a recent SDK I\'m having trouble building my ad hoc distribution configuration.Build generates this warning and error:warning: iPhone apps should include an armv6 architecture (current\n  ARCHS = "armv7")iPhone/iPod Touch: application executable is missing a required\n  architecture.  At least one of the following architecture(s) must be\n  present: armv6 (-19033)However in my project I thought I had things set correctly:I have cleaned all targets.I appreciate any tips.If using Xcode 4.2 or higher, try the following:Click your Project name (in the left column), followed by the Target:Click the \'Build Settings\' tab (in the right column):Click the \'Release\' or \'Distribution\' row under \'Architectures\', and choose \'Other...\':Double click the highlighted row named \'$(ARCHS_STANDARD_32_BIT)\' in the popover that appears, and replace it by typing \'armv6\'. Then add a new row with the plus button in the bottom left of the popover, and type \'armv7\', then click Done:Update: you should add armv7s to target the iPhone 5 as well. (And drop armv6 if building with Xcode 4.5 or higher, which no longer supports armv6.)That\'s it. You should now be able to build/archive without generating errors.If it still doesn\'t work, see this answer from justinxreese, which suggests adding entries for armv6 and armv7 under "Required Device Capabilities" in your info.plist file.If you uncheck "Build Active Architecture Only", then it will build all the valid architectures.Update: This is no longer applicable as of Xcode 4 - follow Nick\'s instructions for Xcode 4 and later.I had this problem even after following the accepted answer and found the following to work:In your Info.plist, add an entry for Required Device Capabilities. This should be an array and will have two entries. It will look like this:In addition to Nick\'s answer about Xcode 4.2, you may also need to review your info.plist file.  It seems as if new projects started in Xcode 4.2 by default specify \'armv7\' in the \'Required Device Capabilities\'.  You\'ll need to remove this if wanting to support devices that run armv6 (e.g. the iPhone 3G).Delete armv7 from the \'Required device capabilities\' in yourProjectName-Info.plistAn ios 6 update Changes in Xcode 4.5.x for ios 6I had this problem too. I just set my deployment target to 4.3 and left only armv7 architecture and it worked. At point almost everyone has 5, so 4.3 is fine.for me it not work with every answer. but I try TARGETS > Architectures > Debug and add a new row with the plus button, and type \'armv6\'(with out \'), then click Done.and finally CMD+B and then right click at PrjectName.app(in Products folder) > Open in Finder > Compress "PROJECT_NAME.APP" (in Debug-iphoneos) > Upload to AppStoreit\'s my screen setting.\nif you have include project please config it all.\nHope your help.After trying a mixture of these answers, I finally stumbled across making it work. Im so pissed off at Apple right now. Just another hour they made me waste. Here is my config.I tried all the answers above ,none resolved my question. So I create a new project and diff the build settings one by one. Only "Alternate Permissions Files" is different.\nThe project build failed has a value armv7. Delete it then clean->build->archive . Succeed!\nHope can solve you questionWow, I update/submit apps about every 6 months. Every time I do this I have to learn the "new" way to do it...Same problems as described above when running iOS 5.1, and Xcode 4.3.2Thanks for the posts! I spent a while updating all of the project settings to armv6, armv7, but no joy. When I set "build active architecture only" to No I got a build error about putting both objects in the same directory.Fortunately, I noticed you guys were modifying the target build settings instead. This is what finally worked (armv6, armv7, and setting "build active architecture only" to No under the Target build Settings). As a disclaimer, I had already set all of the architectures to armv6, armv7 in the project settings too.Anyway, thanks for the help,\nBrentI had to be sure to change these settings in both the Target and Project settings on xCode 4.3.2 after doing that and setting it to build for both armv6 and armv7 everywhere I was able to submit my app. For safe measure I also exited xCode between making the changes and doing a clean, build, archive cycle. Using Xcode 4.2 on Snow Leopard, I used the following settings to build an app that worked on both armv6 (Iphone 3G and lower) AND armv7 (everything newer than 3G including 3GS).architectures: armv6 and armv7 (removed $(ARCHS_STANDARD_32_BIT))\nbuild active architecture only: no\nrequired device capabilities: armv6do not put armv7 in required device capabilities if you want the app to run on 3G and lower as well.Quite a painful problem for me too. Just spent about an hour trying to build and re-build - no joy. In the end I had to do this:I guess it\'s a bunch of jargon about arm6 , arm7 as it looked like my project was valid for both, at least the settings seemed to say so ) , my guess is this is a cynical way to bamboozle us with the technicalities, which we don\'t understand, so we just take the easy option and target the latest iOS ( good for Apple with more people being up-to-date ) ....Here is Apple\'s documentation:Technical Q&A QA1760It says there are two things that you must get right:If this still doesn\'t help you, double check that you are really changing the architecture build settings for the right build configuration \xe2\x80\x93 I wasted half an hour fiddling with the wrong one and wondering why it didn\'t work... Select Edit Scheme... in the Product menu, click the "Archive" scheme in the left list and check the Build Configuration. Change the value if it was not what you expected.Note; I had to perform these steps for both my base project, and the embedded PhoneGap .xcodeproj file in my application.Yes, I embed PhoneGap; they update far to frequently, and I\'ve got less than two months to know that a feature is depreciated.Try changing your deployment target to something higher than an armv6 processor.  The settings for xCode are referencing the operating system level, for instance: iOS version#{3.1, 3.2, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.0, 5.1} (i)You can set this in the build settings tab or the summary tab.  Start at the top left of the window in the Project Navigator, with all the files listed in it.  Click the top-most one which has a blue icon.  (ii)If you are planning on using the programmable shader line circuitry, which is accessed and controlled through openGL ES 2.0 API, then you should set your "Deployment Version" to about 4.3, which I believe is only available on devices such as the 3GS or newer. xCode is reporting that iOS 4.2.5 or higher is needed run armv7 code. And once again, this processor, I believe, started with the 3GS.*  iOS 4.3 seems to be the choice for me, for now. http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Armv7http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_devicesIf xCode keep complaining about armv7, make sure you disconnect any connect device (especially iPhone 5!!) and try again. Took me hours to find out that little piece of information.
