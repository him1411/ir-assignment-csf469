Coming from Perl, I sure am missing the "here-document" means of creating a multi-line string in source code:In Java I have to have cumbersome quotes and plus signs on every line as I concatenate my multiline string from scratch.What are some better alternatives?  Define my string in a properties file?Edit: Two answers say StringBuilder.append() is preferable to the plus notation.  Could anyone elaborate as to why they think so?  It doesn\'t look more preferable to me at all.  I\'m looking for away around the fact that multiline strings are not a first-class language construct, which means I definitely don\'t want to replace a first-class language construct (string concatenation with plus) with method calls.Edit: To clarify my question further, I\'m not concerned about performance at all.  I\'m concerned about maintainability and design issues.Stephen Colebourne has created a proposal for adding multi-line strings in Java 7.Also, Groovy already has support for multi-line strings.It sounds like you want to do a multiline literal, which does not exist in Java.Your best alternative is going to be strings that are just +\'d together. Some other options people have mentioned (StringBuilder, String.format, String.join) would only be preferable if you started with an array of strings.Consider this:Versus StringBuilder:Versus String.format():Versus Java8 String.join():If you want the newline for your particular system, you either need to use System.getProperty("line.separator"), or you can use %n in String.format.Another option is to put the resource in a text file, and just read the contents of that file. This would be preferable for very large strings to avoid unnecessarily bloating your class files.In Eclipse if you turn on the option "Escape text when pasting into a string literal" (in Preferences > Java > Editor > Typing) and paste a multi-lined string whithin quotes, it will automatically add " and \\n" + for all your lines.This is an old thread, but a new quite elegant solution (with only one drawback) is to use a custom annotation.Check : http://www.adrianwalker.org/2011/12/java-multiline-string.htmlEdit: The above URL seems to be broken. A project inspired from that work is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/benelog/multiline The drawback is that you have to activate the corresponding (provided) annotation processor.And you probably have to configure Eclipse to not reformat automatically your javadoc comments.One may find this weird (javadoc comments are not designed to embed anything other than comments), but as this lack of multiline string in Java is really annoying in the end, i find this to be the least worst solution.Another option may be to store long strings in an external file and read the file into a string.This is something that you should never use without thinking about what it\'s doing.  But for one-off scripts I\'ve used this with great success:Example:Code:Java 8 added a new static method to java.lang.String which offers a slightly better alternative:String.join(\n    CharSequence delimiter , \n    CharSequence... elements\n)Using it:If you define your strings in a properties file it\'ll look much worse. IIRC, it\'ll look like:Generally it\'s a reasonable idea to not embed large strings in to source. You might want to load them as resources, perhaps in XML or a readable text format. The text files can be either read at runtime or compiled into Java source. If you end up placing them in the source, I suggest putting the + at the front and omitting unnecessary new lines:If you do have new lines, you might want some of join or formatting method:Pluses are converted to StringBuilder.append, except when both strings are constants so the compiler can combine them at compile time. At least, that\'s how it is in Sun\'s compiler, and I would suspect most if not all other compilers would do the same.So:normally generates exactly the same code as:On the other hand:is the same as:That is, there\'s no penalty in breaking your string literals across multiple lines with plus signs for readability.Sadly, Java does not have multi-line string literals. You either have to concatenate string literals (using + or StringBuilder being the two most common approaches to this) or read the string in from a separate file.For large multi-line string literals I\'d be inclined to use a separate file and read it in using getResourceAsStream() (a method of the Class class). This makes it easy to find the file as you don\'t have to worry about the current directory versus where your code was installed. It also makes packaging easier, because you can actually store the file in your jar file.Suppose you\'re in a class called Foo. Just do something like this:The one other annoyance is that Java doesn\'t have a standard "read all of the text from this Reader into a String" method. It\'s pretty easy to write though:Since Java does not (yet) native support multi-line strings, the only way for now is to hack around it using one of the aforementioned techniques. I built the following Python script using some of the tricks mentioned above:Put that in a file named javastringify.py and your string in a file mystring.txt and run it as follows:You can then copy the output and paste it into your editor. Modify this as needed to handle any special cases but this works for my needs. Hope this helps!But, the best alternative is to use String.formatIn the IntelliJ IDE you just need to type:Then position your cursor inside the quotation marks and paste your string. The IDE will expand it into multiple concatenated lines.You may use scala-code, which is compatible to java, and allows multiline-Strings enclosed with """:(note the quotes inside the string) and from java:Whether this is more comfortable ...? Another approach, if you often handle long text, which should be placed in your sourcecode, might be a script, which takes the text from an external file, and wrappes it as a multiline-java-String like this: so that you may cut-and-paste it easily into your source.Actually, the following is the cleanest implementation I have seen so far.  It uses an annotation to convert a comment into a string variable...So, the end result is that the variable html contains the multiline string.  No quotes, no pluses, no commas, just pure string.This solution is available at the following URL...\nhttp://www.adrianwalker.org/2011/12/java-multiline-string.htmlHope that helps!You can concatenate your appends in a separate method like:Either way, prefer StringBuilder to the plus notation.See Java Stringfier. Turns your text into a StringBuilder java block escaping if needed.If you like google\'s guava as much as I do, it can give a fairly clean representation and a nice, easy way to not hardcode your newline characters too:An alternative I haven\'t seen as answer yet is the java.io.PrintWriter.Also the fact that java.io.BufferedWriter has a newLine() method is unmentioned.A quite efficient and platform independent solution would be using the system property for line separators and the StringBuilder class to build strings:Define my string in a properties file?Multiline strings aren\'t allowed in properties files.  You can use \\n in properties files, but I don\'t think that is much of a solution in your case.When a long series of + are used, only one StringBuilder is created, unless the String is determined at compile time in which case no StringBuilder is used!The only time StringBuilder is more efficient is when multiple statements are used to construct the String.Note: Only one StringBuilder is created.To clarify my question further, I\'m not concerned about performance at all. I\'m concerned about maintainability and design issues.Make it as clear and simple as you can.I suggest using a utility as suggested by ThomasP; and then link that into your build process.  An external file is still present to contain the text, but the file is not read at runtime.\nThe workflow is then:One small trick. Using this I inject javascritp in a dynamically created HTML page Use Properties.loadFromXML(InputStream). There\'s no need for external libs.Better than a messy code (since maintainability and design are your concern), it is preferable not to use long strings.\n\nStart by reading xml properties:\nthen you can use your multiline string in a more maintainable way...\n\n\nMultiLine.xml gets located in the same folder YourClass:PS.: You can use <![CDATA[" ... "]]> for xml-like string.I see at least one case where it should be avoided to use external files for long strings : if these long string are expected values in an unit-test file, because I think the tests should always be written in a way that they don\'t rely on any external resource.It may seem a little crazy, but since heredocs are syntactic sugar over one-line declarations with linebreaks escaped, one could write pre-processor for Java files that would change heredocs into single-liners during preprocessing. It would require writing proper plugins for preprocessing files before compilation phase (for ant/maven build) and a plugin to IDE. From ideological point of view, it differs nothing from f.g. "generics", that are also a kind of pre-processed syntactic sugar over casting.It\'s, however, a lot of work, so I would at your place just use .properties files.Late model JAVA has optimizations for + with constant strings, employs a StringBuffer behind the scenes, so you do not want to clutter your code with it.It points to a JAVA oversight, that it does not resemble ANSI C in the automatic concatenation of double quoted strings with only white space between them, e.g.:I would love to have a multi-line character array constant where embedded linefeeds are honored, so I can present the block without any clutter, e.g.:To get this, one needs to beat on the JAVA gods.The only way I know of is to concatenate multiple lines with plus signs
