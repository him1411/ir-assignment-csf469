ok say the content inside the <body> totals 300px high.If I set the background of my <body> using -webkit-gradient or -moz-linear-gradientThen I maximize my window (or just make it taller than 300px) the gradient will be exactly 300px tall (the height of the content) and just repeat to fill the rest of the window.I am assuming this is not a bug since it is the same in both webkit and gecko.But is there a way to make the gradient stretch to fill the window instead of repeat?Apply the following CSS:Edit: Added margin: 0; to body declaration per comments (Martin).Edit: Added background-attachment: fixed; to body declaration per comments (Johe Green).Regarding a previous answer, setting html and body to height: 100% doesn\'t seem to work if the content needs to scroll. Adding fixed to the background seems to fix that - no need for height: 100%;E.g.:Here\'s what I did to solve this problem... it will show the gradient for the full length of the content, then simply fallback to the background color (normally the last color in the gradient).I\'ve tested this in FireFox 3.6, Safari 4, and Chrome, I keep the background-color in the body for any browsers that for some reason don\'t support styling the HTML tag.Setting html { height: 100%} can wreak havoc with IE. Here\'s an example (png). But you know what works great? Just set your background on the <html> tag. Background extends to the bottom and no weird scrolling behavior occurs. You can skip all of the other fixes. And this is broadly supported. I haven\'t found a browser that doesn\'t let you apply a background to the html tag. It\'s perfectly valid CSS and has been for a while. :)There is a lot of partial information on this page, but not a complete one. Here is what I do:Here is an example:This has been tested with IE, Chrome, and Firefox on pages of various sizes and scrolling needs.Dirty; maybe could you just add a min-height: 100%; to the html, and body tags? That or at least set a default background color that is the end gradient color as well.I know I\'m late to the party, but here\'s a more solid answer.All you need to do is use min-height: 100%; rather than height: 100%; and your gradient background will extend the entire height of the viewport without repeating, even if the content is scrollable.Like this:I had trouble getting the answers in here to work.\nI found it worked better to fix a full-size div in the body, give it a negative z-index, and attach the gradient to it.  Here\'s a full sample\nhttps://gist.github.com/morefromalan/8a4f6db5ce43b5240a6ddab611afdc55this is what I did:before I floated the body, there was a gap on top, and it was showing the background color of html. if I remove the bgcolor of html, when I scroll down, the gradient is cut. so I floated the body and set it\'s position to relative and the width to 100%. it worked on safari, chrome, firefox, opera, internet expl.. oh wait. :Pwhat do you guys think?I have used this CSS code and it worked for me:A related information is that you can create your own great gradients at http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor//Steninstead of 100% i just add some pixxel got this now and it works for whole page without gap:
