How can I get ls to spit out a flat list of recursive one-per-line paths?For example, I just want a flat listing of files with their full paths:ls -a1 almost does what I need, but I do not want path fragments, I want full paths.If you really want to use ls, then format its output using awk:Use find:If you want files only (omit directories, devices, etc):ls -ld $(find .)if you want to sort your output by modification time:ls -ltd $(find .)Try the following simpler way:Best command is: tree -fiIn order to use the files but not the links, you have to remove > from your output:If you want to know the nature of each file, (to read only ASCII files for example) with two whiles:I don\'t know about the full path, but you can use -R for recursion.  Alternatively, if you\'re not bent on ls, you can just do find *.Using no external commands other than ls:Handy for some limited appliance shells where find/locate aren\'t available.find / will do the trickThe easiest way for all you future people is simply:This however, also shows the size of whats contained in each folder\nYou can use awk to output only the folder name:Edit- Sorry sorry, my bad. I thought it was only folders that were needed.\nIll leave this here in case anyone in the future needs it anyways...With having the freedom of using all possible ls options:find -type f | xargs ls -1I think for a flat list the best way is:(or in order to save it in a txt file)Here is a partial answer that shows the directory names. Explanation:ls -mR * lists the full directory names ending in a \':\', then lists the files in that directory separatelysed -n \'s/://p\' finds lines that end in a colon, strip off the colon and print the lineBy iterating over the list of directories, we should be able to find the directories as well. Still workin on it. It is a challenge to get the wildcards through xargs.Run a bash command with the following format:ls -lR  is what you were looking for, or atleast I was. cheersAdding a wildcard to the end of an ls directory forces full paths. Right now you have this:You could do this instead:Unfortunately this does not print the full path for directories recursed into, so it may not be the full solution you\'re looking for.Oh really a long list of answers. \nIt helped a lot and finally I created by own which I was looking for :To List All the Files in a directory and its sub-directories:To List All the Directories in a directory and its sub-directories:To List All the Directories and Files in a directory and its sub-directories:A lot of answers I see. This is mine, and I think quite useful if you are working on Mac.I\'m sure you know there are some "bundle" files (.app, .rtfd, .workflow, and so on). And looking at Finder\'s window they seem single files. But they are not. And $ ls or $ find see them as directories... So, unless you need list their contents as well, this works for me:Of course this is for the working dir, and you could add other bundles\' extensions (but always with a / after them). Or any other extensions if not bundle\'s without the /.Rather interesting the ".lpdf/" (multilingual pdf). It has normal ".pdf" extension (!!) or none in Finder. This way you get (or it just counts 1 file) for this pdf and not a bunch of stuff\xe2\x80\xa6If the directory is passed as a relative path and you will need to convert it to an absolute path before calling find.  In the following example, the directory is passed as the first parameter to the script:This is slow but works recursively and prints both directories and files. You can pipe it with awk/grep if you just want the file names without all the other info/directories:@ghostdog74:\nLittle tweak with your solution. \nFollowing code can be used to search file with its full absolute path.I knew the file name but wanted the directory as well.find $PWD | fgrep filenameworked perfectly in Mac OS 10.12.1Don\'t make it complicated. I just used this and got a beautiful output:
