Is there any way to convert Java String to a byte[] (not the boxed Byte[])?In trying this:and I\'m getting separate outputs. Unable to display 1st output as it is a gzip string.The second is an address. Is there anything I\'m doing wrong? I need the result in a byte[] to feed it to gzip decompressor, which is as follows.The object your method decompressGZIP() needs is a byte[].So the basic, technical answer to the question you have asked is:However the problem you appear to be wrestling with is that this doesn\'t display very well. Calling toString() will just give you the default Object.toString() which is the class name + memory address. In your result [B@38ee9f13, the [B means byte[] and 38ee9f13 is the memory address, separated by an @.For display purposes you can use:But this will just display as a sequence of comma-separated integers, which may or may not be what you want.To get a readable String back from a byte[], use:The reason the Charset version is favoured, is that all String objects in Java are stored internally as UTF-16. When converting to a byte[] you will get a different breakdown of bytes for the given glyphs of that String, depending upon the chosen charset.Try using String.getBytes(). It returns a byte[] representing string data.\nExample:Simply:You can use String.getBytes() which returns the byte[] array.You might wanna try return new String(byteout.toByteArray(Charset.forName("UTF-8")))It is not necessary to change java as a String parameter. You have to change the c code to receive a String without a pointer and in its code:
