I have a table with ~500k rows; varchar(255) UTF8 column filename contains a file name;I\'m trying to strip out various strange characters out of the filename - thought I\'d use a character class: [^a-zA-Z0-9()_ .\\-]Now, is there a function in MySQL that lets you replace through a regular expression? I\'m looking for a similar functionality to REPLACE() function - simplified example follows:I know about REGEXP/RLIKE, but those only check if there is a match, not what the match is.(I could do a "SELECT pkey_id,filename FROM foo WHERE filename RLIKE \'[^a-zA-Z0-9()_ .\\-]\'" from a PHP script, do a preg_replace and then "UPDATE foo ... WHERE pkey_id=...", but that looks like a last-resort slow & ugly hack)No.But if you have access to your server, you could use a user defined function (UDF)  like mysql-udf-regexp.Use MariaDB instead. It has a functionSee MariaDB docs and PCRE Regular expression enhancementsNote that you can use regexp grouping as well (I found that very useful):returnsMy brute force method to get this to work was just:I recently wrote a MySQL function to replace strings using regular expressions. You could find my post at the following location:http://techras.wordpress.com/2011/06/02/regex-replace-for-mysql/Here is the function code: Example execution:we solve this problem without using regex\nthis query replace only exact match string. Example:emp_id employee_firstname1    jay2    jay ajay3    jayAfter executing query result:emp_id  employee_firstname1        abc2        abc ajay3        abc        I\'m happy to report that since this question was asked, now there is a satisfactory answer! Take a look at this terrific package:https://github.com/mysqludf/lib_mysqludf_pregSample SQL:I found the package from this blog post as linked on this question.You \'can\' do it ... but it\'s not very wise ... this is about as daring as I\'ll try ... as far as full RegEx support your much better off using perl or the like. We can use IF condition in SELECT query as below:Suppose that for anything with "ABC","ABC1","ABC2","ABC3",..., we want to replace with "ABC" then using REGEXP and IF() condition in the SELECT query, we can achieve this.Syntax:Example:The following expands upon the function provided by Rasika Godawatte but trawls through all necessary substrings rather than just testing single characters:DemoSQL Fiddle Demo\nor Rextester DemoLimitations
