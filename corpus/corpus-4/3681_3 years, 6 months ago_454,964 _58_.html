How can I use regular expressions in Excel and take advantage of Excel\'s powerful grid like setup for data manipulation?I understand Regex is not ideal for many situations (To use or not to use regular expressions?) since excel can use Left, Mid, Right, Instr type commands for similar manipulations.  Regular expressions are used for Pattern Matching.  To use in Excel follow these steps :Step 1: Add VBA reference to "Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions 5.5"Step 2: Define your patternBasic definitions:-  Range.  [] Match exactly one of the objects inside these brackets.() Groups different matches for return purposes.  See examples below.{} Multiplier for repeated copies of pattern defined before it.+  Match at least one, or more, of the pattern defined before it.?  Match zero or one of the pattern defined before it.*  Match zero or more of the pattern defined before it.\n - E.g. Wildcard for pattern that may or may not be present.\n - E.g. [a-z]* matches empty string or string of lower case letters..  Matches any character except newline \\n|  OR operator ^  NOT operator\\  Escapes special character that follows (overrides above behavior)Anchoring Patterns:^  Match must occur at start of string$  Match must occur at end of stringPrecedence table:Predefined Character Abbreviations:Example 1: Run as macroThe following example macro looks at the value in cell A1 to see if the first 1 or 2 characters are digits.  If so, they are removed and the rest of the string is displayed.  If not, then a box appears telling you that no match is found.  Cell A1 values of 12abc will return abc, value of 1abc will return abc, value of abc123 will return "Not Matched" because the digits were not at the start of the string.Example 2: Run as an in-cell functionThis example is the same as example 1 but is setup to run as an in-cell function. To use, change the code to this:Place your strings ("12abc") in cell A1.  Enter this formula =simpleCellRegex(A1) in cell B1 and the result will be "abc".Example 3: Loop Through RangeThis example is the same as example 1 but loops through a range of cells.Example 4: Splitting apart different patternsThis example loops through a range (A1, A2 & A3) and looks for a string starting with three digits followed by a single alpha character and then 4 numeric digits.  The output splits apart the pattern matches into adjacent cells by using the ().  $1 represents the first pattern matched within the first set of ().Results:Additional Pattern ExamplesTo make use of regular expressions directly in Excel formulas the following UDF (user defined function) can be of help. It more or less directly exposes regular expression functionality as an excel function.It takes 2-3 parameters.Extracting an email address:Results in: some@email.comExtracting several substrings:Results in: E-Mail: some@email.com, Name: Peter GordonTo take apart a combined string in a single cell into its components in multiple cells:Results in: Peter Gordon some@email.com ...To use this UDF do the following (roughly based on this Microsoft page. They have some good additional info there!):Click on Insert Module. If you give your module a different name make sure the Module does not have the same name as the UDF below (e.g. naming the Module Regex and the function regex causes #NAME! errors).In the big text window in the middle insert the following:Save and close the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Editor window.I am not an expert as you people are, even then here is my way.Expanding on patszim\'s answer for those in a rush.add the following code:  The regex pattern is placed in one of the cells and absolute referencing is used on it.\n\nFunction will be tied to workbook that its created in.\nIf there\'s a need for it to be used in different workbooks, store the function in Personal.XLSBI needed to use this as a cell function (like SUM or VLOOKUP) and found that it was easy to:Create the following function either in workbook or in its own module:Then you can use in cell with =REGPLACE(B1, "(\\w) (\\d+)", "$1$2") (ex: "A 243" to "A243")@patszim : Very helpful, thank you.\nAdded a regex_subst() function. Examples:Here is the simplified code (simpler for me, anyway).   I couldn\'t figure out how to build a suitable output pattern using the above to work like my examples:
