I\'m terrible at naming and realize that there are a better set of names for my models in my Rails app. Is there any way to use a migration to rename a model and its corresponding table?Here\'s an example:I had to go and rename the model declaration file manually.Edit:In Rails 3.1 & 4, ActiveRecord::Migration::CommandRecorder knows how to reverse rename_table migrations, so you can do this:(You still have to go through and manually rename your files.)In Rails 4 all I had to do was the def changeAnd all of my indexes were taken care of for me. I did not need to manually update the indexes by removing the old ones and adding new ones.And it works using the change for going up or down in regards to the indexes as well.The other answers and comments covered table renaming, file renaming, and grepping through your code.I\'d like to add a few more caveats:Let\'s use a real-world example I faced today: renaming a model from \'Merchant\' to \'Business.\'You also need to replace your indexes:And rename your files etc, manually as other answers here describe.See: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.htmlMake sure you can rollback and roll forward after you write this migration. It can get tricky if you get something wrong and get stuck with a migration that tries to effect something that no longer exists. Best trash the whole database and start again if you can\'t roll back. So be aware you might need to back something up.Also: check schema_db for any relevant column names in other tables defined by a has_ or belongs_to or something. You\'ll probably need to edit those too.And finally, doing this without a regression test suite would be nuts.
