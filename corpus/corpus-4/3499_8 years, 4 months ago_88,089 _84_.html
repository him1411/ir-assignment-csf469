What\'s the difference between ECMAScript and JavaScript? From what I\'ve deduced, ECMAScript is the standard and JavaScript is the implementation. Is this correct?ECMAScript is the language, whereas JavaScript, JScript, and even ActionScript 3 are called "dialects". Wikipedia sheds some light on this.I think a little history lesson is due.JavaScript was originally named Mocha and changed to Livescript but ultimately became JavaScript.It\'s important to note that JavaScript came before ECMAscript and the history will tell you why.To start from the beginning, JavaScript derived its name from Java and initially Brendan Eich (the creator of JS) was asked to develop a language that resembled Java for the web for Netscape.Eich, however decided that Java was too complicated with all its rules and so set out to create a simpler language that even a beginner could code in.  This is evident in such things like the relaxing of the need to have a semicolon.After the language was complete, the marketing team of Netscape requested Sun to allow them to name it JavaScript as a marketing stunt and hence why most people who have never used JavaScript think it\'s related to Java.About a year or two after JavaScript\'s release in the browser, Microsoft\'s IE took the language and started making its own implementations such as JScript. At the same time, IE was dominating the market and not long after Netscape had to shut its project.Before Netscape went down, they decided to start a standard that would guide the path of JavaScript, named ECMAScript.ECMAScript had a few releases and in 1999 they released their last version (ECMAScript 3) before they went into hibernation for the next 10 years.  During this 10 years, Microsoft dominated the scenes but at the same time they weren\'t improving their product and hence Firefox was born (led by Eich) and a whole heap of other browsers such as Chrome, Opera.ECMAScript released its 5th Edition in 2009 (the 4th edition was abandoned) with features such as strict mode.  Since then, ECMAScript has gained a lot of momentum and is scheduled to release its 6th Edition in a few months from now with the biggest changes its had thus far.You can use a list of features for ECMAScript 6 here http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/es6/ and also the browser support.  You can even start writing Ecmascript 6 like you do with CoffeeScript and use a compiler to compile down to Ecmascript 5.Whether ECMAScript is the language and JavaScript is a dialect is arguable, but not important. If you continue to think like this it might confuse you.  There is no compiler out there that would run ECMAScript, and I believe JavaScript is considered the Language which implements a standard called ECMAScript.There are also other noticeable languages that implement ECMAScript such as ActionScript (used for Flash)ECMAScript = ES:ECMAScript\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0a Standard\xc2\xa0for\xc2\xa0scripting\xc2\xa0languages.Languages like Javascript are based\xc2\xa0on\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0ECMAScript\xc2\xa0standard.ECMA Standard is based\xc2\xa0on\xc2\xa0several\xc2\xa0originating\xc2\xa0technologies, the\xc2\xa0most\xc2\xa0well\xc2\xa0known\xc2\xa0being\xc2\xa0JavaScript\xc2\xa0(Netscape)\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0JScript\xc2\xa0(Microsoft).ECMA means\xc2\xa0European\xc2\xa0Computer\xc2\xa0Manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0AssociationJavaScript = JS:JavaScript is the most popular implementation of the ECMAScript Standard.The\xc2\xa0core\xc2\xa0features\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0Javascript\xc2\xa0are\xc2\xa0based\xc2\xa0on\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0ECMAScript\xc2\xa0standard,\xc2\xa0\nbut\xc2\xa0Javascript\xc2\xa0also\xc2\xa0has\xc2\xa0other\xc2\xa0additional\xc2\xa0features\xc2\xa0that\xc2\xa0are\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0in\nthe\xc2\xa0ECMA specifications/standard.ActionScript and\xc2\xa0JScript are other languages that implement the\xc2\xa0ECMAScript.JavaScript was submitted to\xc2\xa0ECMA for standardization but due to\xc2\xa0trademark\xc2\xa0issues with\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0name\xc2\xa0Javascript the\xc2\xa0standard\xc2\xa0became\xc2\xa0called\xc2\xa0ECMAScript.Every\xc2\xa0browser\xc2\xa0has\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0JavaScript\xc2\xa0interpreter.ES5 = ECMAScript 5:ES5 is a version of the\xc2\xa0ECMAScript (old/current one).ES5 is the JavaScript you know and use in the browser today.ES5 does not require a build step (transpilers) to transform it into something that will run in today\'s browsers.ECMAScript\xc2\xa0version\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0was\xc2\xa0finished\xc2\xa0in\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02009,\xc2\xa0\nthe\xc2\xa0latest\xc2\xa0versions\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0all\xc2\xa0major\xc2\xa0browsers\xc2\xa0(Chrome,\xc2\xa0Safari,\xc2\xa0Firefox,\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0IE)\xc2\xa0\nhave\xc2\xa0implemented\xc2\xa0version\xc2\xa05.

What is ECMAScript i.e. ES?ECMAScript is a standard for a scripting language, and the Javascript language is based on the ECMAScript standard.Is Javascript exactly the same as ECMAScript? No, Javascript is not exactly equivalent to ECMAScript. The core features of Javascript are based on the ECMAScript standard, but Javascript also has other additional features that are not in the ECMA specifications/standard.Do other languages use the ECMAScript standard?Yes, there are languages other than JavaScript that also implement the ECMAScript Standard as their core. ActionScript (used by Adobe Flash) and JScript (used by Microsoft) are both languages that implement the ECMAScript standard. The best way to think of languages that implement the ECMAScript standard (including Javascript) is as dialects that all share the same \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d structure, but each language adds their own style and \xe2\x80\x9ctone\xe2\x80\x9d on top of the ECMAScript standard.Why is it called ECMAScript?Javascript was originally created at Netscape, and they wanted to standardize the language. So, they submitted the language to the European Computer Manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s Association (ECMA) for standardization. But, there were trademark issues with the name Javascript, and the standard became called ECMAScript, which is the name it holds today as well. Also because of trademark issues, Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s version of the language is called JScript \xe2\x80\x93 even though JScript is, at it\xe2\x80\x99s core, the same language as Javascript.< Edit: >\nChronological progress of JSi know this is an old post but hopefully this will help someone.In the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s different versions of js started coming out like javascript  from netscape,\nJs script from Microsoft. So ecmascript was introduced as a standard. But ecmascript forms only a part of javascript which specifies its core syntax,types,objects etc. Probably that explains the inconsistent implementations of javascript across diff. browsersReference - Wrox(Professional Javascript For Web Developers)In my understanding, ECMAScript is the "Theory" or "Specification", and Javascript is "Practicals" or "Implementation".JavaScript is a ECMAScript language. ECMAScript isn\'t necessarily JavaScript.Existing answers paraphrase the main point quite well.The main point is that ECMAScript is the bare abstract language, without any domain specific extensions, it\'s useless in itself. The specification defines only the language and the core objects of it. While JavaScript and ActionScript and other dialects add the domain specific library to it, so you can use it for something meaningful.There are many ECMAScript engines, some of them are open source, others are proprietary. You can link them into your program then add your native functions to the global object so your program becomes scriptable. Although most often they are used in browsers. Javascript was the original name, meant to capitalize on the popularity of java.  ECMA is the standards body that oversees the standard that was eventually put in place so the names are roughly equivalent.Implementations have other names, like V8 or Rhino, etc.JavaScript is one branch of languages formed around the ECMAScript standard. I believe ECMA is the European Computer Manufacturers Association, not that this is really relevant or anything.Don\'t forget another popular language formed around the ECMA Script standard is ActionScript, used in Adobe Flash/Flex.I doubt we\'d ever use the word "ECMAScript" if not for the fact that the name "JavaScript" is owned by Sun. For all intents and purposes, the language is JavaScript. You don\'t go to the bookstore looking for ECMAScript books, do you?It\'s a bit too simple to say that "JavaScript" is the implementation. JScript is Microsoft\'s implementation.ECMAScript is a standard for JS, look at these statements from MDN:JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled\n  programming language with first-class functions. While it is most\n  well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser\n  environments also use it, such as node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe\n  Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic\n  language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative\n  (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern\n  browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least\n  ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth\n  major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript\n  2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since\n  then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This\n  documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently\n  ECMAScript 2018.For more info, visit here
