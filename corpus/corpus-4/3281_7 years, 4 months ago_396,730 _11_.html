I am trying to insert a PDF or doc file as an appendix in my latex file. Do you know how I can do this?Use the pdfpages package.Run texdoc pdfpages in a shell to see the complete manual for pdfpages.For putting a whole pdf in your file and not just 1 page, use:I don\'t think there would be an automatic way. You might also want to add a page number to the appendix correctly. Assuming that you already have your pdf document of several pages, you\'ll have to extract each page first of your pdf document using Adobe Acrobat Professional for instance and save each of them as a separate pdf file. Then you\'ll have to include each of the the pdf documents as images on an each page basis (1 each page) and use newpage between each page e,g,Now each page will appear with 1 pdf image per page and you\'ll have a correct page number at the bottom. As shown in my example, you\'ll have to play a bit with the scale factor for each image to get it in the right size that will fit on a single page. Hope that helps...There is an option without additional packages that works under pdflatexAdapt this code"diagrama-spearman.pdf" is a plot generated with TikZ and this is the code (it is another .tex file different from the .tex file where I want to insert a pdf)This is the diagram I included
