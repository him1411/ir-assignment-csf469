What is this double-colon ::? E.g. Foo::Bar.I found a definition: The :: is a unary operator that allows: constants, instance methods and class methods defined within a class or module, to be accessed from anywhere outside the class or module.What good is scope (private, protected) if you can just use :: to expose anything?:: is basically a namespace resolution operator. It allows you to access items in modules, or class-level items in classes. For example, say you had this setup:You could access CONSTANT from outside the module as SomeModule::InnerModule::MyClass::CONSTANT.It doesn\'t affect instance methods defined on a class, since you access those with a different syntax (the dot .).Relevant note: If you want to go back to the top-level namespace, do this: ::SomeModule \xe2\x80\x93 Benjamin OakesThis simple example illustrates it:Taken from http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_operators.htm:: Lets you access a constant, module, or class defined inside another class or module. It is used to provide namespaces so that method and class names don\'t conflict with other classes by different authors.When you see ActiveRecord::Base in Rails it means that Rails has something likei.e. a class called Base inside a module ActiveRecord which is then referenced as ActiveRecord::Base (you can find this in the Rails source in activerecord-n.n.n/lib/active_record/base.rb)A common use of :: is to access constants defined in modules e.g.The :: operator does not allow you to bypass visibility of methods marked private or protected.What good is scope (private, protected) if you can just use :: to expose anything?In Ruby, everything is exposed and everything can be modified from anywhere else.If you\'re worried about the fact that classes can be changed from outside the "class definition", then Ruby probably isn\'t for you.On the other hand, if you\'re frustrated by Java\'s classes being locked down, then Ruby is probably what you\'re looking for.No, it is not to access every method, it is a "resolution" operator, that is, you use it to resolve the scope (or location you can say) of a constant/static symbol.For example in the first of your line, Rails use it to find the Base class inside the ActiveRecord.Module, in your second one it is used to locate the class method (static) of the Routes class, etc, etc.It is not used to expose anything, its used to "locate" stuff around your scopes.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_resolution_operatorIt is all about preventing definitions from clashing with other code linked in to your project.  It means you can keep things separate. For example you can have one method called "run" in your code and you will still be able to call your method rather than the "run" method that has been defined in some other library that you have linked in. Ruby on rails uses :: for namespace resolution.To use it :   Also, other usage is : When using nested routesOmniauthCallbacksController is defined under users.and route is like : :: Is used to create a scope . In order to access Constant EATER from 2 modules we need to scope the modules to reach up to the constant Adding to previous answers, it is valid Ruby to use :: to access instance methods. All the following are valid:As per best practices I believe only the last one is recommended.
