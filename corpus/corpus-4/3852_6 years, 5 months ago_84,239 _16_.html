If you can target iOS 4.0 or aboveUsing GCD, is it the best way to create singleton in Objective C (thread safe)?This is a perfectly acceptable and thread-safe way to create an instance of your class.  It may not technically be a "singleton" (in that there can only ever be 1 of these objects), but as long as you only use the [Foo sharedFoo] method to access the object, this is good enough.instancetype is just one of the many language extensions to Objective-C, with more being added with each new release.Know it, love it.And take it as an example of how paying attention to the low-level details can give you insights into powerful new ways to transform Objective-C. Refer here: instancetypeMySingleton.hMySingleton.mDave is correct, that is perfectly fine. You may want to check out Apple\'s docs on creating a singleton for tips on implementing some of the other methods to ensure that only one can ever be created if classes choose NOT to use the sharedFoo method.You can avoid that the class be allocated with overwriting the alloc method. If you want to make sure that [[MyClass alloc] init] returns the same object as sharedInstance (not necessary in my opinion, but some folks want it), that can be done very easily and safely using a second dispatch_once: This allows any combination of [[MyClass alloc] init] and [MyClass sharedInstance] to return the same object; [MyClass sharedInstance] would just be a bit more efficient. How it works: [MyClass sharedInstance] will call [[MyClass alloc] init] once. Other code could call it as well, any number of times. The first caller to init will do the "normal" initialisation and store the singleton object away in the init method. Any later calls to init will completely ignore what alloc returned and return the same sharedInstance; the result of alloc will be deallocated.The +sharedInstance method will work as it always did. If it isn\'t the first caller to call [[MyClass alloc] init], then the result of init is not the result of the alloc call, but that is OK. To create thread safe singleton you can do like this:and this blog explain singleton very well singletons in objc/cocoa
