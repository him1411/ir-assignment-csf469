I have a Rakefile that compiles the project in two ways, according to the global variable $build_type, which can be :debug or :release (the results go in separate directories):I wish to create a task that compiles the project with both configurations in turn, something like this:Is there a way to call a task as if it were a method?  Or how can I achieve anything similar?This always executes the task, but it doesn\'t execute its dependencies:This one executes the dependencies, but it only executes the task if \nit has not already been invoked:This first resets the task\'s already_invoked state, allowing the task to\nthen be executed again, dependencies and all:(Notice that dependencies already invoked are not re-executed)for example:That should sort you out, just needed the same thing myself.If you want each task to run regardless of any failures, you can do something like:I would suggest not to create general debug and release tasks if the project is really something that gets compiled and so results in files. You should go with file-tasks which is quite doable in your example, as you state, that your output goes into different directories.\nSay your project just compiles a test.c file to out/debug/test.out and out/release/test.out with gcc you could setup your project like this:This setup can be used like:This does a little more as asked for, but shows my points:
