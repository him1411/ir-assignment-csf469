I\'m searching for the fastest way to know if a value exists in a list (a list with millions of values in it) and what its index is? I know all values in the list are unique like my example.My first methods I try is(3.8sec in my real code):My second methods I try is (2x faster:1.9sec on my real code):Proposed methods from Stackoverflow user (2.74sec on my real code):In my real code, first method take 3.81sec and the second methods take 1.88sec.\nIt\'s a good improvement but:I\'m a beginner with Python/scripting and I want to know if a fastest way exist to do the same things and save more process time?More specific explication for my application:In the API of blender a can access to a list of particles:From there , I can access to it\'s location:And I test for each particles if a neighbour exist by searching\nin the location of each particles like:Clearest and fastest way to do it.You can also consider using a set, but constructing that set from your list may take more time than faster membership testing will save. The only way to be certain is to benchmark well. (this also depends on what operations you require)As stated by others, in can be very slow for large lists. Here are some comparisons of the performances for in, set and bisect. Note the time (in second) is in log scale.Code for testing:with this you can find whatever value you want in an array.\nThis is the fastest way to know if a chosen value is in an array.You could put your items into a set. Set lookups are very efficient.Try:edit In a comment you say that you\'d like to get the index of the element. Unfortunately, sets have no notion of element position. An alternative is to pre-sort your list and then use binary search every time you need to find an element.This will only be a good idea if a doesn\'t change and thus we can do the dict() part once and then use it repeatedly. If a does change, please provide more detail on what you are doing.It sounds like your application might gain advantage from the use of a Bloom Filter data structure. In short, a bloom filter look-up can tell you very quickly if a value is DEFINITELY NOT present in a set. Otherwise, you can do a slower look-up to get the index of a value that POSSIBLY MIGHT BE in the list. So if your application tends to get the "not found" result much more often then the "found" result, you might see a speed up by adding a Bloom Filter.For details, Wikipedia provides a good overview of how Bloom Filters work, and a web search for "python bloom filter library" will provide at least a couple useful implementations.this is not the code, but the algorithm for very fast searchingif your list and the value you are looking for are all numbers, this is pretty straightforward, if strings: look at the bottom:if you also need the original position of your number, look for it in the second, index columnif your list is not made of numbers, the method still works and will be fastest, but you may need to define a function which can compare/order stringsof course this needs the investment of the sorted() method, but if you keep reusing the same list for checking, it may be worth ittry
