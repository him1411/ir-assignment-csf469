I want to catch the enter key press event on the textbox below. To make it more clear I am using a ng-repeat to populate the tbody. Here is the HTML: This is my module:I am using a resource to populate the table and my controller code is:You need to add a directive, like this:Javascript:HTML:An alternative is to use standard directive ng-keypress="myFunct($event)"Then in your controller you can have:My simplest approach using just angular build-in directive:ng-keypress, ng-keydown or ng-keyup.Usually, we want add keyboard support for something that already handled by ng-click.for instance:Now, let\'s add keyboard support.trigger by enter key:by space key:by space or enter key:if you are in modern browserMore about keyCode:\nkeyCode is deprecated but well supported API, you could use $evevt.key in supported browser instead.\nSee more in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyAnother simple alternative: And the ng-ui alternative:Here is what I figured out when I was building an app with a similar requirement,\nit doesn\'t require writing a directive and it\'s relatively simple to tell what it does:You can use ng-keydown\n="myFunction($event)" as attribute.Tryingdid nothing for me.Strangley the sample at https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngKeypress, which does ng-keypress="count = count + 1", works.I found an alternate solution, which has pressing Enter invoke the button\'s ng-click.htmlcontroller.jsYou can also apply it to a controller on a parent element.

However I also wanted to pass the value of the input field to the function specified. This is my solution:});The use in HTML is as follows:Kudos to EpokK for his answer.What about this?:Now when you push enter key after write something in your input, the form know how to handle it.Some example of code that I did for my project.\nBasically you add tags to your entity.\nImagine you have input text, on entering Tag name you get drop-down menu with preloaded tags to choose from, you navigate with arrows and select with Enter:HTML +  AngularJS v1.2.0-rc.3Controller.jsCSS + Bootstrap v2.3.2I\'m a bit late .. but i found a simpler solution using auto-focus .. This could be useful for buttons or other when popping a dialog :<button auto-focus ng-click="func()">ok</button>That should be fine if you want to press the button onSpace or Enter clicks .here\'s my directive:usage:you can use ng-keydown , ng-keyup , ng-press such as this .to triger a function :or if you have one condion such as when he press escape (27 is the key\n  code for escape)I think using document.bind is a bit more elegantTo get document to the controller constructor:
