How can I get the last value of an ArrayList?I don\'t know the last index of the ArrayList.The following is part of the List interface (which ArrayList implements):E is the element type. If the list is empty, get throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException. You can find the whole API documentation here.this should do it:There isn\'t an elegant way in vanilla Java.The Google Guava library is great - check out their Iterables class. This method will throw a NoSuchElementException if the list is empty, as opposed to an IndexOutOfBoundsException, as with the typical size()-1 approach - I find a NoSuchElementException much nicer, or the ability to specify a default:You can also provide a default value if the list is empty, instead of an exception:or, if you\'re using Options:I use micro-util class for getting last (and first) element of list:Slightly more flexible:The size() method returns the number of elements in the ArrayList.  The index values of the elements are 0 through (size()-1), so you would use myArrayList.get(myArrayList.size()-1) to retrieve the last element.If you can, swap out the ArrayList for an ArrayDeque, which has convenient methods like removeLast.The last item in the list is list.size() - 1. The collection is backed by an array and arrays start at index 0.So element 1 in the list is at index 0 in the array Element 2 in the list is at index 1 in the arrayElement 3 in the list is at index 2 in the array and so on..All you need to do is use size() to get the last value of the Arraylist. \nFor ex. if you ArrayList of integers, then to get last value you will have toRemember, elements in an Arraylist can be accessed using index values. Therefore, ArrayLists are generally used to search items.arrays store their size in a local variable called \'length\'.  Given an array named "a" you could use the following to reference the last index without knowing the index valuea[a.length-1]to assign a value of 5 to this last index you would use:a[a.length-1]=5;How about this..\nSomewhere in your class...If you modify your list, then use listIterator() and iterate from last index (that is size()-1 respectively).\nIf you fail again, check your list structure.
