I\'m trying to search for the word Gadaffi. What\'s the best regular expression to search for this? My best attempt so far is:But I still seem to be missing some journals. Any suggestions?Update: I found a pretty extensive list here: http://blogs.abcnews.com/theworldnewser/2009/09/how-many-different-ways-can-you-spell-gaddafi.htmlThe answer below matches all the 30 variants:\\b[KGQ]h?add?h?af?fi\\bArabic transcription is (Wiki says) "Qa\xe1\xb8\x8f\xe1\xb8\x8f\xc4\x81f\xc4\xab", so maybe adding a Q. And one H ("Gadhafi", as the article (see below) mentions).Btw, why is there a $ at the end of the regex?Btw, nice article on the topic:Gaddafi, Kadafi, or Qaddafi? Why is the Libyan leader\xe2\x80\x99s name spelled so many different ways?.EDITTo match all the names in the article you\'ve mentioned later, this should match them all. Let\'s just hope it won\'t match a lot of other stuff :D Easy... (Qadaffi|Khadafy|Qadafi|...)... it\'s self-documented, maintainable, and assuming your regexp engine actually compiles regular expressions (rather than interpreting them), it will compile to the same DFA that a more obfuscated solution would.Writing compact regular expressions is like using short variable names to speed up a program. It only helps if your compiler is brain-dead.One interesting thing to note from your list of potential spellings is that there\'s only 3 Soundex values for the contained list (if you ignore the outlier \'Kazzafi\')G310, K310, Q310Now, there are false positives in there (\'Godby\' also is G310), but by combining the limited metaphone hits as well, you can eliminate them.A few tweaks, and lets say some cyrillic transliteration, and you\'ll have a fairly robust solution.Using CPAN module Regexp::Assemble:This produces the following regular expression:I think you\'re over complicating things here. The correct regex is as simple as:It matches the concatenation of the seven Arabic Unicode code points that forms the word \xd8\xa7\xd9\x84\xd9\x82\xd8\xb0\xd8\xa7\xd9\x81\xd9\x8a (i.e. Gadaffi).If you want to avoid matching things that no-one has used (ie avoid tending towards ".+") your best approach would be to create a regular expression that\'s just all the alternatives (eg. (Qadafi|Kadafi|...)) then compile that to a DFA, and then convert the DFA back into a regular expression.  Assuming a moderately sensible implementation that would give you a "compressed" regular expression that\'s guaranteed not to contain unexpected variants.If you\'ve got a concrete listing of all 30 possibilities, just concatenate them all together with a bunch of "ors". Then you can be sure that it only matches the exact things you\'ve listed, and no more. Your RE engine will probably be able to optimize in further, and, well, with 30 choices even if it doesn\'t it\'s still not a big deal. Trying to fiddle around with manually turning it into a "clever" RE can\'t possibly turn out better and may turn out worse.Certainly not the most optimized version, split on syllables to maximize matches while trying to make sure we don\'t get false positives.Well since you are matching small words why don\'t you try a similarity search engine with the Levenshtein distance? You can allow at most k insertions or deletions. This way you can change the distance function to other things that work better for your specific problem. There are many functions available in the simMetrics library.A possible alternative is the online tool for generate regular expressions from examples http://regex.inginf.units.it.\nGive it a chance!Why not do a mixed approach? Something between a list of all possibilities and a complicated Regex that matches far too much.Regex is about pattern matching and I can\'t see a pattern for all variants in the list. Trying to do so, will also find things like "Gazzafy" or "Quud\'haffi" which are most probably not a used variant and definitly not on the list.But I can see patterns for some of the variants, and so I ended up with this:At the beginning I list the ones where I can\'t see a pattern, then followed by some variants where there are patterns.See it here on www.rubular.comI know this is an old question, but...Neither of these two regexes is the prettiest, but they are optimized and both match ALL the variations in the original post."Little Beauty" #1"Little Beauty" #2Rest in Peace, Muammar.Just an addendum: you should add "Gheddafi" as alternate spelling. So the RE should beWhat else starts with Q, G, or K, has a d, z or t in the middle, and ends in "fi" the people actually search for?  Done.Interesting that I\'m getting downvoted.  Can someone leave some false positives in the comments?
