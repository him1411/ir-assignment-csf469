I know how to get the params for queries like this:In this case, I can use req.params.id to get the parameter (e.g. 2 in /sample/2).However, for url like /sample/2?color=red, how can I access the variable color?I tried req.params.color but it didn\'t work.So, after checking out the express reference, I found that req.query.color would return me the value I\'m looking for.Update: req.param() is now deprecated, so going forward do not use this answer.Your answer is the preferred way to do it, however I thought I\'d point out that you can also access url, post, and route parameters all with req.param(parameterName, defaultValue).In your case:From the express guide:lookup is performed in the following order:Note the guide does state the following:Direct access to req.body, req.params, and req.query should be\n  favoured for clarity - unless you truly accept input from each object.However in practice I\'ve actually found req.param() to be clear enough and makes certain types of refactoring easier.Use req.query, for getting he value in query string parameter in the route.\nRefer req.query.\nSay if in a route, http://localhost:3000/?name=satyam you want to get value for name parameter, then your \'Get\' route handler will go like this :-@Zugwait\'s answer is correct. req.param() is deprecated. You should use req.params, req.query or req.body.But just to make it clearer:req.params will be populated with only the route values. That is, if you have a route like /users/:id, you can access the id either in req.params.id or req.params[\'id\'].req.query and req.body will be populated with all params, regardless of whether or not they are in the route. Of course, parameters in the query string will be available in req.query and parameters in a post body will be available in req.body.So, answering your questions, as color is not in the route, you should be able to get it using req.query.color or req.query[\'color\'].Hey Query string and parameters are different .You need to use both in single routing url Please check bellow examples my be helpful you .Get link pass your second segment is your id example : http://localhost:port/file-upload/123If you facing problem please use Passing variables as query string using \'?\' operatorGet link your like this example : http://localhost:port/sample?id=123Both in single example Post link example example : http://localhost:port/sample/123?id=123The express manual says that you should use req.query to access the QueryString.
