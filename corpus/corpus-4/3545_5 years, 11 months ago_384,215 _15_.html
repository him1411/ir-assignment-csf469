I am looking for minimum and maximum values for integers in python. For eg., in Java, we have Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE. Is there something like this in python?In Python 2, there\'s sys.maxint:And you can calculate the minimum value with -sys.maxint - 1 as seen here. Of course Python just switches from plain to long integers once you exceed this value.In Python 3 this value has no significance at all for integers. (However, a closely related value is still available as sys.maxsize, in case you\'re actually looking for the machine\'s word size.)sys.maxint constant has been removed from Python 3.0 onward, instead use sys.maxsizeIntegersRefer : https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.htmlIn Python integers will automatically switch from a fixed-size int representation into a variable width long representation once you pass the value sys.maxint, which is either 231 - 1 or 263 - 1 depending on your platform. Notice the L that gets appended here:From the Python manual:Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions and operators. Unadorned integer literals (including binary, hex, and octal numbers) yield plain integers unless the value they denote is too large to be represented as a plain integer, in which case they yield a long integer. Integer literals with an \'L\' or \'l\' suffix yield long integers (\'L\' is preferred because 1l looks too much like eleven!).Python tries very hard to pretend its integers are mathematical integers and are unbounded. It can, for instance, calculate a googol with ease:If you just need a number that\'s bigger than all others, you can usein similar fashion, a number smaller than all others:This works in both python 2 and 3.I came here from google and was looking for python 3.  In that case its,
