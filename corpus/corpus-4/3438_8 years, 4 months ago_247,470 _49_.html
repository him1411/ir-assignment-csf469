This question already has an answer here:I want to store a set of integers that get auto incremented at build time:When I compile, it would auto-increment Revision. When I build the setup project, it would increment MinorVersion (I\'m OK with doing this manually). MajorVersion would only be incremented manually.Then I could display a version number in menu Help/About to the user as:How can this be achieved?This question asks not only how to have an auto-incrementing version number, but also how to use that in code which is a more complete answer than others.If you add an AssemblyInfo class to your project and amend the AssemblyVersion attribute to end with an asterisk, for example:Visual studio will increment the final number for you according to these rules (thanks galets, I had that completely wrong!)To reference this version in code, so you can display it to the user, you use reflection.  For example,It\'s also worth noting that if both AssemblyVersion and AssemblyFileVersion are specified, you won\'t see this on your .exe.Setting only the 4th number to be * can be bad, as the version won\'t always increment.\nThe 3rd number is the number of days since the year 2000, and the 4th number is the number of seconds since midnight (divided by 2) [IT IS NOT RANDOM]. So if you built the solution late in a day one day, and early in a day the next day, the later build would have an earlier version number. I recommend always using X.Y.* instead of X.Y.Z.* because your version number will ALWAYS increase this way.You could use the T4 templating mechanism in Visual Studio to generate the required source code from a simple text file : I wanted to configure version information generation for some .NET\n  projects. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since I investigated available\n  options, so I searched around hoping to find some simple way of doing\n  this. What I\xe2\x80\x99ve found didn\xe2\x80\x99t look very encouraging: people write\n  Visual Studio add-ins and custom MsBuild tasks just to obtain one\n  integer number (okay, maybe two). This felt overkill for a small\n  personal project.The inspiration came from one of the StackOverflow discussions where\n  somebody suggested that T4 templates could do the job. And of course\n  they can. The solution requires a minimal effort and no Visual Studio\n  or build process customization. Here what should be done:You will have to decide about version number generation algorithm. For\n  me it was sufficient to auto-generate a revision number that is set to\n  the number of days since January 1st, 2010. As you can see, the\n  version generation rule is written in plain C#, so you can easily\n  adjust it to your needs.Yes, today it\xe2\x80\x99s 113 days since January 1st, 2010. Tomorrow the\n  revision number will change.What I like about this approach is that it is lightweight (no custom\n  MsBuild tasks), and auto-generated version information is not added to\n  source control. And of course using C# for version generation\n  algorithm opens for algorithms of any complexity.If you put an asterisk in for build and revision visual studio uses the number of days since Jan. 1st 2000 as the build number, and the number of seconds since midnight divided by 2 as the revision.A MUCH better life saver solution is http://autobuildversion.codeplex.com/It works like a charm and it\'s VERY flexible.This is my implementation of the T4 suggestion... Basically, if you follow the steps I outlined below your project will increment the build number every time you build the project regardless of the selected configuration (i.e. Debug|Release), and it will increment the revision number every time you do a Release build.To explain in more detail, this will read the existing AssemblyInfo.cs file, and use regex to find the AssemblyVersion information and then increment the revision and build numbers based on input from TextTransform.exe. Note that the build and/or revision numbers will only be incremented when processed from TextTransform.exe. If you save the .tt file or right click on it and click on "Run Custom Tool," then it will leave the AssemblyInfo.cs file intact. Also note that if AssemblyInfo.cs does not exist, then it will create it with a value of 0 for both the build and revision.Replace your AssemblyInfo.cs file with this AssemblyInfo.tt file:Add this to your Debug pre-build event:Add this to your Release pre-build event:If you are using a web application project, then add this to your pre-build event:\nNote, you may have to adjust some things such as the path to your AssemblyInfo.tt file and depending on your version of Visual Studio, you may also have to adjust the path to TextTransform.exe. Here\'s the quote on AssemblyInfo.cs from MSDN:You can specify all the values or you\n  can accept the default build number,\n  revision number, or both by using an\n  asterisk (). For example,\n  [assembly:AssemblyVersion("2.3.25.1")]\n  indicates 2 as the major version, 3 as\n  the minor version, 25 as the build\n  number, and 1 as the revision number.\n  A version number such as\n  [assembly:AssemblyVersion("1.2.")]\n  specifies 1 as the major version, 2 as\n  the minor version, and accepts the\n  default build and revision numbers. A\n  version number such as\n  [assembly:AssemblyVersion("1.2.15.*")]\n  specifies 1 as the major version, 2 as\n  the minor version, 15 as the build\n  number, and accepts the default\n  revision number. The default build\n  number increments daily. The default\n  revision number is randomThis effectively says, if you put a 1.1.* into assembly info, only build number will autoincrement, and it will happen not after every build, but daily. Revision number will change every build, but randomly, rather than in an incrementing fashion.This is probably enough for most use cases. If that\'s not what you\'re looking for, you\'re stuck with having to write a script which will autoincrement version # on pre-build stepUse AssemblyInfo.csCreate the file in App_Code: and fill out the following or use Google for other attribute/property possibilities.AssemblyInfo.csAssemblyVersion being the part you are really after.Then if you are working on a website, in any aspx page, or control, you can add in the <Page> tag, the following:(replacing folderpath with appropriate variable of course).I don\'t believe you need to add compiler options in any manner for other classes; all the ones in the App_Code should receive the version information when they are compiled.Hope that helps.Star in version (like "2.10.3.*") - it is simple, but the numbers are too largeAutoBuildVersion - looks great but its dont work on my VS2010.druciferre\'s script works, but I can not in my studio set different modes for Debug pre-build event and Release pre-build event.so I changed the script a bit...\ncommamd:and script (this works to the "Debug" and "Release" configurations):You could try using UpdateVersion by Matt Griffith.  It\'s quite old now, but works well.  To use it, you simply need to setup a pre-build event which points at your AssemblyInfo.cs file, and the application will update the version numbers accordingly, as per the command line arguments.As the application is open-source, I\'ve also created a version to increment the version number using the format (Major version).(Minor version).([year][dayofyear]).(increment).  More information about this and the revised code is available on my blog entry, Assembly Version Numbers and .NET.Update: I\'ve put the code for my modified version of the UpdateVersion application on GitHub: https://github.com/munr/UpdateVersionYou can do more advanced versioning using build scripts such as Build Versioning
