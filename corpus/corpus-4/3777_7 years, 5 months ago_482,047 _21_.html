With all the new CSS3 border stuff going on (-webkit, ...) is it now possible to add a border to your font? (Like the solid white border around the blue Twitter logo). If not, are there any not-too-ugly hacks that will accomplish this in CSS/XHTML or do I still need to fire up Photoshop?The right answer is:This will set four same type shadows from the four sides.Here\'s a SCSS mixin to generate the stroke: http://codepen.io/pixelass/pen/gbGZYLYES old question.. with accepted (and good) answers..BUT...In case anybody ever needs this and hates typing code...THIS is a 2px black border with CrossBrowser support (not IE)\nI needed this for @fontface fonts so it needed to be cleaner than previous seen answers...\nI takes every side pixelwise to make sure there are (almost) no gaps for "fuzzy" (handrawn or similar) fonts.\nSubpixels (0.5px) could be added but I don\'t need it.Long code for just the border??? ...YES!!!You could perhaps emulate a text-stroke, using the css text-shadow (or -webkit-text-shadow/-moz-text-shadow) and a very low blur:But while this is more widely available than the -webkit-text-stroke property, I doubt that it\'s available to the majority of your users, but that might not be a problem (graceful degradation, and all that).There seems to be a \'text-stroke\' property, but (at least for me) it only works in Safari.http://webkit.org/blog/85/introducing-text-stroke/To elaborate more on some answers that have mentioned -webkit-text-stroke, here\'s is the code to make it work:An in-depth article about using text stroke is here and a list of browsers that support text stroke is here.Here\'s what I\'m using :Here\'s a LESS mixin to generate the stroke: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BNYGBy?editors=110(it\'s based on pixelass answer that instead uses SCSS)I once try to do those round corners and drop shadows with css3 stuffs. Later on, I found it is still very poor in support (Internet Explorer(s), of course!) I end up trying to do that in JS (HTML canvas with IE Canvas), but performance impacts a lot (even on my C2D machine). In short, if you really need the effect, consider JS libraries (most of them should able to run on IE6) but don\'t over do as performance really impacts; if you still have alternative... like you can do SFiR, then PS it and SFiR it. CSS3 isn\'t enough ready today.
