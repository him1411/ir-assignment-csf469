Command line curl can display response header by using -D option, but I want to see what request header it is sending. How can I do that?curl\'s -v or --verbose option shows the HTTP request headers, among other things. Here is some sample output:I believe the command line switch you are looking for to pass to curl is -I.Example usage:Additionally, if you encounter a response HTTP status code of 301, you might like to also pass a -L argument switch to tell curl to follow URL redirects, and, in this case, print the headers of all pages (including the URL redirects), illustrated below:This is better than -I as it doesn\'t send a HEAD request, which can produce different results.It\'s better than -v because you don\'t need so many hacks to un-verbose it.The verbose option is handy, but if you want to see everything that curl does (including the HTTP body that is transmitted, and not just the headers), I suggest using the --trace-ascii output_file.txt option.You get a nice header output with the following command:Results in:As you can see curl outputs both the outgoing and the incoming headers and skips the bodydata althought telling you how big the body is.Additionally for every line the direction is indicated so that it is easy to read. I found it particular useful to trace down long chains of redirects.I had to overcome this problem myself, when debugging web applications. -v is great, but a little too verbose for my tastes. This is the (bash-only) solution I came up with:This works because the output from -v is sent to stderr, not stdout. By redirecting this to a subshell, we can sed it to remove lines that start with *. Since the real output does not pass through the subshell, it is not affected. Using a subshell is a little heavy-handed, but it\'s the easiest way to redirect stderr to another command. (As I noted, I\'m only using this for testing, so it works fine for me.)the -v option for curl is too verbose in the error output which contains the leading *(status line) or >(request head field) or <(response head field). to get only the request head field:to get only the request head field:or to dump it into /tmp/test.txt file with the -D optionin order to filter the -v output, you should direct the error output to terminal and the std output to /dev/null, the -s option is to forbid the progress meteringin php \nset curl optionsCURLINFO_HEADER_OUT => true,and maybe dump header result into mysql.. for easier logging.also can use wireshark if using browser for more detailed than what F12/Firebug gives
