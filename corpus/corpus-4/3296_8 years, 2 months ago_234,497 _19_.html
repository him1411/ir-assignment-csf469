I\'m working on a python script that starts several processes and database connections. Every now and then I want to kill the script with a Ctrl+C signal, and I\'d like to do some cleanup.In Perl I\'d do this:How do I do the analogue of this in Python?Register your handler with signal.signal like this:Code adapted from here.More documentation on signal can be found here. You can treat it like an exception (KeyboardInterrupt), like any other. Make a new file and run it from your shell with the following contents to see what I mean:And as a context manager:To use:Nested handlers:From here: https://gist.github.com/2907502You can handle Ctrl-C by catching the KeyboardInterrupt exception. You can implement any clean-up code in the exception handler.From Python\'s documentation:You can use the functions in Python\'s built-in signal module to set up signal handlers in python. Specifically the signal.signal(signalnum, handler) function is used to register the handler function for signal signalnum.Referred main as the main function and exit_gracefully as the CTRL + c handlerI adapted the code from @udi to support multiple signals (nothing fancy) :This code support the keyboard interrupt call (SIGINT) and the SIGTERM (kill <process>)In contrast to Matt J his answer, I use a simple object. This gives me the possibily to parse this handler to all the threads that needs to be stopped securlery.Elsewhere
