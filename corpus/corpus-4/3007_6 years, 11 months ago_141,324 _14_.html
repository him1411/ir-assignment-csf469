What is the difference? When should I use which? Why are there so many of them?kind_of? and is_a? are synonymous. instance_of? is different from the other two in that it only returns true if the object is an instance of that exact class, not a subclass.Example: "hello".is_a? Object and "hello".kind_of? Object return true because "hello" is a String and String is a subclass of Object. However "hello".instance_of? Object returns false.What is the difference?From the documentation:and:If that is unclear, it would be nice to know what exactly is unclear, so that the documentation can be improved.When should I use which?Never. Use polymorphism instead.Why are there so many of them?I wouldn\'t call two "many". There are two of them, because they do two different things.It is more Ruby-like to ask objects whether they respond to a method you need or not, using respond_to?. This allows both minimal interface and implementation unaware programming. It is not always applicable of course, thus there is still a possibility to ask about more conservative understanding of "type", which is class or a base class, using the methods you\'re asking about.I also wouldn\'t call two many (is_a? and kind_of? are aliases of the same method), but if you want to see more possibilities, turn your attention to #class method:
