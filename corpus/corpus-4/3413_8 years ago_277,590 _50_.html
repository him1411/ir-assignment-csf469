Is it possible to print HTML pages with custom headers and footers on each printed page?I\'d like to add the word "UNCLASSIFIED" in Red, Arial, size 16pt to the top and bottom of every printed page, regardless of the content.To clarify, if the document was printed onto 5 pages, each page should have the custom header and footer.Does anybody know if this is possible using HTML/CSS?If you take the element that you want to be the footer and set it to be position:fixed and bottom:0, when the page prints it will repeat that element at the bottom of each printed page.  The same would work for a header element, just set top:0 instead.For example:CSS:i believe the correct answer is that HTML 5 and CSS3 have no support for printing page header and footers in print media.And while you might be able to simulate it with: they each have bugs that prevent them from being the ideal general solution.I just spent the better half of my day coming up with a solution that actually worked for me and thought I would share what I did. The problem with the solutions above that I was having was that all of my paragraph elements would overlap with the footer I wanted at the bottom of the page. In order to get around this, I used the following CSS:The page-break-inside for p and content-block was crucial for me. Any time I have a p following an h*, I wrap them both in a div class = "content-block"> to ensure they stay together and don\'t break. I\'m hoping that someone finds this useful because it took me about 3 hours to figure out (I\'m also new to CSS/HTML, so there\'s that...)Per a request in the comments, I am adding an example HTML document. You\'ll want to copy this into an HTML file, open it, and then choose to print the page. The print preview should show this working. It worked in Firefox and IE on my end, but Chrome made the font small enough to fit on one page, so it didn\'t work there. Use page breaks to define the styles in CSS:Then add the markup in the document at the appropriate places:ReferencesCSS Paged Media: Page BreaksMDN: page-break-beforeMDN: break-beforeMulti-column LayoutXHTML Print: Second EditionWebkit Bug 5097: CSS2 page-break-after does not workPrint HTML FAQ: Will the program respect CSS styles such as page-break-after?How to deal with page breaks when printing a large HTML tableFrom this question -- add the following styles to a print-only stylesheet. This solution will work in IE and Firefox, but not in Chrome (as of version 21):I have been searching for years for a solution and found this post on how to print a footer that works on multiple pages without overlapping page content.My requirement was IE8, so far I have found that this does not work in Chrome.This example uses tables and the tfoot element by setting the css style: I tried to fight this futile battle combining tfoot & css rules but it only worked on Firefox :(. When using plain css, the content flows over the footer. When using tfoot, the footer on the last page does not stay nicely on the bottom. This is because table footers are meant for tables, not physical pages. Tested on Chrome 16, Opera 11, Firefox 3 & 6 and IE6.If you can use javascipt, have the client handle laying out the content using javascript to place elements based on available space.You could use the jquery columnizer plugin to dynamically lay out your content in fixed size blocks and position your headers and footers as part of the rendering routine.\nhttp://welcome.totheinter.net/columnizer-jquery-plugin/See example 10\nhttp://welcome.totheinter.net/autocolumn/sample10.htmlThe browser will still add its own headers or footers if enabled in the os. Consistent layout across platforms and browsers will likely require conditional css.Is this something you want to print-only? You could add it to every page on your site and use CSS to define the tag as a print-only media.As an example, this could be an example header:And in your CSS, do something like this:Finally, to include the header/footer on every page you might use server-side includes or if you have any pages being generated with PHP or ASP you could simply code it in to a common file.Edit:This answer is intended to provide a way to show something on the physical printed version of a document while not showing it otherwise. However just as comments suggest, it doesn\'t solve the issue of having a footer on multiple printed pages when content overflows.I\'m leaving it here in case it\'s helpful nevertheless.One approach that only works for adding headers to every page is to wrap your content in a <table> and then put your header content in a <thead> tag and your content in a <tbody> tag, like so:This works in Chrome, not 100% sure about other browsers.If you don;t need the formatting use document.title and that works like charm in every major browser (tested in Chrome , IE 11, Firefox).Or you can use If you are using a template engine like Asp.net Razor Engine or Angular, \nI think you must re-generate your page and split the page in several pages and then you can freely markup each page and put header and footer on theme.\n one example could be as bellow:Based on some post, i think position: fixed works for me.Press Ctrl+P in chrome see the header & footer text on each page.\nHope it helps
