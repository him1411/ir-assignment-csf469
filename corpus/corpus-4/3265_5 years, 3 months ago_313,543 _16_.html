I am checking for the existence of an object property with a variable holding the property name in question. This is undefined because it\'s looking for myObj.myProp but I want it to check for myObj.propOrYou can use hasOwnProperty, but based on the reference you need quotes when using this method:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnPropertyAnother way is to use in operator, but you need quotes here as well:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/inThank you for everyone\'s assistance and pushing to get rid of the eval statement. \nVariables needed to be in brackets, not dot notation. This works and is clean, proper code. Each of these are variables: appChoice, underI, underObstr.A much more secure way to check if property exists on the object is to use empty object or object prototype to call hasOwnProperty()Reference from MDN Web Docs - Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()You can use hasOwnProperty() as well as in operator.You can also use this object-hasOwnProperty component I wrote to avoid copy-pasting it across places. It can be used to determine whether the object has the specified property.Examples:How it works:what about? !!myObject[\'myProp\'] works for me.
