I\'m starting with git and GitHub and there\'s a project I\'m watching on GitHub. I unintentionally clicked to fork it. Now it appears as a new project to me.I have some doubts about it:I\'d like to delete it. By now I\'m just studying the code and don\'t really need the fork.Deleting it will do nothing to the original project. Editing it will only edit your fork on your repo page.By far the easiest way is to log in gitHub account:2017-06-14 - GitHub changed the UI again, Here are new images. Enjoy.\n\nJust delete the forked repo from your GitHub account. https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-a-repository/It wont make any changes in the original one; cos, its your repo now. There will not be any harm deleting the forked repositories. You can again fork that. It won\'t change the original code. The flow is like this...1) You fork a repository. Just think of this as another copy of code which you can access or make changes to. The url of this repository will be of the form https://github.com/your-user-name/original-repo.2) You make some changes to that in your local machine and push them. Now the copy you created will be updated, but not the original one from which you have forked your repo. 3) If you want the changes you added to your forked repo to be applied to original repo(this may be helpful to the people who are organizing the repo) then you have to create a pull request which you can do through UI. Then if they like your contribution, they will merge that with their code.Generally this is what open source organizations do.Deleting your forked repository will not affect the master(original) repository.Like I have shown an example by deleting a forked repoThis is my forked repo (Image)Deleting the forked repoAnd no changes to the original repository.The master repo is something like an original one.Forking is same as creating a xerox copy of the original one.  Even if you get your xeroxed paper damaged, will it be that the original document also gets damaged. Obviously No.So its the same as that.Hope this helps. Answer is NO. It won\'t affect the original/main repository where you forked from. (Functionally, it will be incorrect if such an access is provided to a non-owner).Just wanted to add this though.Warning: It will delete the local commits and branches you created on\n  your forked repo. So, before deleting make sure there is a backup of\n  that code with you if it is important.Best way would be getting a git backup of forked repo using:or other methods that are familiar.select project to delete->settings->buttom click delete button->enter name of the repositories
