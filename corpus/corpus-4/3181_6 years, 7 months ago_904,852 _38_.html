I\'ve been working on a website and I\'d like to add a small icon to the browser tab.How can I do this in HTML and where in the code would I need to place it (e.g. header)? I have a .png logo file that I\'d like to convert to an icon.Related: HTML set image on browser tab.There are actually two ways to add a favicon to a website.Simply add the following code to the <head> element:PNG favicons are supported by most browsers, except IE <= 10. For backwards compatibility, you can use ICO favicons.Note that you don\'t have to precede icon in rel attribute with shortcut anymore. From MDN Link types:The shortcut link type is often seen before icon, but this link type is non-conforming, ignored and web authors must not use it anymore.From another SO answer (by @mercator):All modern browsers (tested with Chrome 4, Firefox 3.5, IE8, Opera 10 and Safari 4) will always request a favicon.ico unless you\'ve specified a shortcut icon via <link>.So all you have to do is to make the /favicon.ico request to your website return your favicon. This option unfortunately doesn\'t allow you to use a PNG icon.Place the ico address in the head with a link-tag:The best one that I found is http://www.favicomatic.com/\nI say best because it gave me the crispest favicon, and required no editing after their transformation.\nIt will generate favicons at 16x16 and 32x32 and to quote them "Every damn size, sir!"\nAlso, their site looks cool and is easy to use.They also generate the html that you need to use for the files they generate.I looked at the first 20 or so google results, and this was by far the best.I\'ve successfully done this for my website.Only exception is, the SeaMonkey browser requires HTML code inserted in your <head>; whereas, the other browsers will still display the favicon.ico without any HTML insertion. Also, any browser other than IE may use other types of images, not just the .ico format. I hope this helps.There are a number of different icons and even splash screens that you can set for various devices. This answer goes through how to support them all.Here are some snippets I have used with relevant links to where I gathered the information. See my blog for more information and more information about the ASP.NET MVC Boilerplate project template with all this built in right out of the box (Including sample image files).Add the following mark-up to your html head. The commented out sections are entirely optional. While the uncommented sections are recommended to cover all icon usages. Don\'t be scared, most if it is comments to help you.My browserconfig.xml file. Full explanation above.My manifest.json file. Full explanation above.A list of the files in the project (Note that the names of these files are important if you decide to put some of them at the root of your project to avoid using the above meta tags):Total OverheadIf you take out the comments that\'s 3KB of extra HTML, if you don\'t support splash screens that\'s 1.5KB. If you are using GZIP compression on your HTML content, which everyone should be doing these days, that leaves you with about 634 Bytes of overhead per request to support all platforms or 446 Bytes without splash screens. I personally think its worth it to support IOS, Android and Windows devices but its your choice, I\'m just giving the options!Side Note About The Current Web Icon/Splash Screen/Settings SituationThis situation with vendor specific icons, splash screens and special tags to control the web browser or pinned icons is ridiculous. In a perfect world we would all use a favicon.svg file which could look good at any size and could be placed at the root of the page. Only FireFox supports this at the time of writing (See CanIUse.com).However, icons are not the only setting these days, there are several other vendor specific settings (shown above) but a favicon.svg file would cover most use cases.UpdateUpdated to include the new Android/Chrome version M39+ favicon/theming options. Interestingly, they have gone with a similar approach to Microsoft but are using a JSON file instead of XML.There are a lot of complicated solutions above. For me? I used GIMP to save a copy of the original PNG file after changing the image size to 32 x 32 pixels.Just be sure to save it as a *.ico file and use the listed aboveFor Chrome to display the page icon (favicon), you need to check your website from a hosting server or you can use local host while developing and testing  your website on your PC.  I\'d recommend you to try http://faviconer.com to convert your .PNG or .GIF to a .ICO file.You can create both 16x16 and 32x32 (for new retina display) in one .ICO file.No issues with IE and FirefoxIf i may add more clarity for those of you that are still confused.  The .ico file tends to provide more transparency than the .png, which is why i recommend converting your image here as mentioned above:\nhttp://www.favicomatic.com/done\nalso, inside the href is just the location of the image, it can be any server location, remember to add the http:// in front, otherwise it won\'t work.
