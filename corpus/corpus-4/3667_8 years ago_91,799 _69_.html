Our Git repositories started out as parts of a single monster SVN repository where the individual projects each had their own tree like so:Obviously, it was pretty easy to move files from one to another with svn mv. But in Git, each project is in its own repository, and today I was asked to move a subdirectory from project2 to project1. I did something like this:But that seems pretty convoluted. Is there a better way to do this sort of thing in general? Or have I adopted the right approach?Yep, hitting on the --subdirectory-filter of filter-branch was key. The fact that you used it essentially proves there\'s no easier way - you had no choice but to rewrite history, since you wanted to end up with only a (renamed) subset of the files, and this by definition changes the hashes. Since none of the standard commands (e.g. pull) rewrite history, there\'s no way you could use them to accomplish this.You could refine the details, of course - some of your cloning and branching wasn\'t strictly necessary - but the overall approach is good! It\'s a shame it\'s complicated, but of course, the point of git isn\'t to make it easy to rewrite history.If your history is sane, you can take the commits out as patch and apply them in the new repository:Or in one line(Taken from Exherbo\xe2\x80\x99s docs)Having tried various approaches to move a file or folder from one Git repository to another, the only one which seems to work reliably is outlined below.It involves cloning the repository you want to move the file or folder from, moving that file or folder to the root, rewriting Git history, cloning the target repository and pulling the file or folder with history directly into this target repository.Make a copy of repository A as the following steps make major\nchanges to this copy which you should not push!(assuming myprojects is the repository you want to copy from)cd into itDelete the link to the original repository to avoid accidentally\nmaking any remote changes (eg. by pushing)Go through your history and files, removing anything that is not in\ndirectory 1.  The result is the contents of directory 1 spewed out\ninto to the base of repository A.For single file move only: go through what\'s left and remove\neverything except the desired file. (You may need to delete files\nyou don\'t want with the same name and commit.)eg. FILE_TO_KEEP = pom.xml to keep only the pom.xml file from FOLDER_TO_KEEPCleanup stepCleanup stepCleanup stepYou may want to import these files into repository B within a directory not the root:Make that directoryMove files into that directoryAdd files to that directoryCommit your changes and we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to merge these files into the\nnew repositoryMake a copy of repository B if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have one already(assuming FOLDER_TO_KEEP is the name of the new repository you are copying to)cd into itCreate a remote connection to repository A as a branch in repository\nB(repo-A-branch can be anything - it\'s just an arbitrary name)Pull from this branch (containing only the directory you want to\nmove) into repository B.The pull copies both files and history.  Note: You can use a merge instead of a pull, but pull works better. Finally, you probably want to clean up a bit by removing the remote\nconnection to repository APush and you\xe2\x80\x99re all set.I found this very useful. It is a very simple approach were you create patches that are applied to the new repo. See the linked page for more details.It only contains three steps (copied from the blog):The only issue I had was that I could not apply all patches at once usingUnder Windows I got an InvalidArgument error. So I had to apply all patches one after another.KEEPING THE DIRECTORY NAMEThe subdirectory-filter (or the shorter command git subtree) works good but did not work for me since they remove the directory name from the commit info. In my scenario I just want to merge parts of one repository into another and retain the history WITH full path name.My solution was to use the tree-filter and to simply remove the unwanted files and directories from a temporary clone of the source repository, then pull from that clone into my target repository in 5 simple steps.This answer provide interesting commands based on git am and presented using examples, step by step.Example: Extract history of file3, file4 and file5Clean the temporary directory destinationClean your the repo sourceExtract history of each file in email formatUnfortunately option --follow or --find-copies-harder cannot be combined with --reverse. This is why history is cut when file is renamed (or when a parent directory is renamed).After: Temporary history in email formatSuppose you want to move these three files in this other repo (can be the same repo).Therefore reorganize your files:Your temporary history is now:Change also filenames within the history:Note: This rewrites the history to reflect the change of path and filename.\n      (i.e. the change of the new location/name within the new repo)Your other repo is:Apply commits from temporary history files:Your other repo is now:Use git status to see amount of commits ready to be pushed :-)Note: As the history has been rewritten to reflect the path and filename change:\n      (i.e. compared to the location/name within the previous repo)To list the files having been renamed:More customizations: You can complete the command git log using options --find-copies-harder or --reverse. You can also remove the first two columns using cut -f3- and grepping complete pattern \'{.* => .*}\'.Having had a similar itch to scratch (altough only for some files of a given repository) this script proved to be really helpful: git-importThe short version is that it creates patch files of the given file or directory ($object) from the existing repository: which then get applied to a new repository:For details please look up:The one I always use is here http://blog.neutrino.es/2012/git-copy-a-file-or-directory-from-another-repository-preserving-history/ . Simple and fast.For compliance with stackoverflow standards, here is the procedure:Using inspiration from http://blog.neutrino.es/2012/git-copy-a-file-or-directory-from-another-repository-preserving-history/ , I created this Powershell function for doing the same, which has worked great for me so far:Usage for this example:After you\'ve done this, you can re-organize the files on the migrate-from-project2 branch before merging it.
