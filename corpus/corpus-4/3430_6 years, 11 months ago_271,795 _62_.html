How can I count the number of times a particular string occurs in another string. For example, this is what I am trying to do in Javascript:The g in the regular expression (short for global) says to search the whole string rather than just find the first occurrence:This matches is twice. And, if there are no matches, it returns 0.Matches:I\'ve made a benchmark test and my function is more then 10 times\n  faster then the regexp match function posted by gumbo. In my test\n  string is 25 chars length. with 2 occurences of the character \'o\'. I\n  executed 1 000 000 times in Safari.Safari 5.1Benchmark> Total time execution: 5617 ms (regexp)Benchmark> Total time execution: 881 ms  (my function 6.4x faster)Firefox 4Benchmark> Total time execution: 8547 ms (Rexexp)Benchmark> Total time execution:  634 ms  (my function 13.5x faster)Edit: changes I\'ve madecached substring lengthadded type-casting to string.added optional \'allowOverlapping\' parameterfixed correct output for "" empty substring case.You can try this:My solution:You can use match to define such function:Just code-golfing the above solution :-)alert("This is a string." + match(/is/g).length);Here is the fastest function!Why is it faster?All operations are as combined as they can be, avoiding slowdowns due to multiple operationsHere is a slower and more readable version:This one is slower because of the counter, long var names and misuse of 1 var.To use it, you simply do this:Edit: (2013/12/16)DON\'T use with Opera 12.16 or older! it will take almost 2.5x more than the regex solution!On chrome, this solution will take between 14ms and 20ms for 1,000,000 characters.The regex solution takes 11-14ms for the same amount.Using a function (outside String.prototype) will take about 10-13ms.Here is the code used:The result of all the solutions should be 100,000!Note: if you want this function to count more than 1 char, change where is c=(c+\'\')[0] into c=c+\'\'The non-regex version:I think the purpose for regex is much different from indexOf.\nindexOf simply find the occurance of a certain string while in regex you can use wildcards like [A-Z] which means it will find any capital character in the word without stating the actual character.Example:String.prototype.Count = function (find) {\n    return this.split(find).length - 1;\n}\n"This is a string.".Count("is");This will return 2.Super duper old, but I needed to do something like this today and only thought to check SO afterwards. Works pretty fast for me.Refer :- count a substring appears in the string for step by step explanation.Building upon @Vittim.us answer above. I like the control his method gives me, making it easy to extend, but I needed to add case insensitivity and limit matches to whole words with support for punctuation. (e.g. "bath" is in "take a bath." but not "bathing")The punctuation regex came from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/25575009/497745 (How can I strip all punctuation from a string in JavaScript using regex?)Please feel free to modify and refactor this answer if you spot bugs or improvements.For anyone that finds this thread in the future, note that the accepted answer will not always return the correct value if you generalize it, since it will choke on regex operators like $ and .. Here\'s a better version, that can handle any needle:Try itSimple version without regex:Now this is a very old thread i\'ve come across but as many have pushed their answer\'s, here is mine in a hope to help someone with this simple code.I\'m not sure if it is the fastest solution but i preferred it for simplicity and for not using regex (i just don\'t like use them!)Use get_occurrence(varS,string) to find occurrence of both characters and string in a String.Try this:
