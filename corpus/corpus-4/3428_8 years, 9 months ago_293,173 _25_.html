I need to read smallish (few MB at the most, UTF-8 encoded) XML files, rummage around looking at various elements and attributes, perhaps modify a few and write the XML back out again to disk (preferably with nice, indented formatting).What would be the best XML parser for my needs?  There are lots to choose from.  Some I\'m aware of are:And of course the one in the JDK (I\'m using Java 6).  I\'m familiar with Xerces but find it clunky.Recommendations?If speed and memory is no problem, dom4j is a really good option. If you need speed, using a StAX parser like Woodstox is the right way, but you have to write more code to get things done and you have to get used to process XML in streams.I think you should not consider any specific parser implementation. Java API for XML Processing lets you use any conforming parser implementation in a standard way. The code should be much more portable, and when you realise that a specific parser has grown too old, you can replace it with another without changing a line of your code (if you do it correctly).Basically there are three ways of handling XML in a standard way:   Forget about proprietary APIs such as JDOM or Apache ones (i.e. Apache Xerces XMLSerializer) because will tie you to a specific implementation that can evolve in time or lose backwards compatibility, which will make you change your code in the future when you want to upgrade to a new version of JDOM or whatever parser you use. If you stick to Java standard API (using factories and interfaces) your code will be much more modular and maintainable.There is no need to say that all (I haven\'t checked all, but I\'m almost sure) of the parsers proposed comply with a JAXP implementation so technically you can use all, no matter which.Here is a nice comparision on DOM, SAX, StAX & TrAX \n(Source: http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17802_01/webservices/webservices/docs/1.6/tutorial/doc/SJSXP2.html )Feature                  StAX                      SAX                         DOM                     TrAX API Type                 Pull,streaming      Push,streaming      In memory tree     XSLT RuleEase of Use           High                     Medium                  High                     Medium  XPath Capability    No                        No                         Yes                      Yes  CPU & Memory     Good                  Good                    Varies                   Varies  Forward Only         Yes                    Yes                         No                        No  Read XML              Yes                    Yes                        Yes                     Yes  Write XML               Yes                    No                          Yes                     Yes  CRUD                       No                      No                         Yes                     No  Simple XML http://simple.sourceforge.net/ is very easy for (de)serializing objects.In addition to SAX and DOM there is STaX parsing available using XMLStreamReader which is an xml pull parser.I have found dom4j to be the tool for working with XML. Especially compared to Xerces.I wouldn\'t recommended this is you\'ve got a lot of "thinking" in your app, but using XSLT could be better (and potentially faster with XSLT-to-bytecode compilation) than Java manipulation.If you care less about performance, I\'m a big fan of Apache Digester, since it essentially lets you map directly from XML to Java Beans.Otherwise, you have to first parse, and then construct your objects.
