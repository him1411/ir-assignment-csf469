I would like to know if it is possible to get attributes of the enum values and not of the enum itself? For example, suppose I have the following enum:What I want is given the enum type, produce 2-tuples of enum string value and its description.Value was easy:But how do I get description attribute\'s value, to populate Tuple.Desc? I can think of how to do it if the Attribute belongs to the enum itself, but I am at a loss as to how to get it from the value of the enum.This should do what you need.This piece of code should give you a nice little extension method on any enum that lets you retrieve a generic attribute.  I believe it\'s different to the lambda function above because it\'s simpler to use and slightly - you only need to pass in the generic type.This is a generic implementation using a lambda for the selectionCall it like this:I\'ve merged a couple of the answers here to create a little more extensible solution. I\'m providing it just in case it\'s helpful to anyone else in the future. Original posting here.This solution creates a pair of extension methods on Enum. The first allows you to use reflection to retrieve any attribute associated with your value. The second specifically calls retrieves the DescriptionAttribute and returns it\'s Description value.As an example, consider using the DescriptionAttribute attribute from System.ComponentModelTo use the above extension method, you would now simply call the following:orIn addition to AdamCrawford response, I\'ve further created a more specialized extension methods that feed of it to get the description.hence, to get the description, you could either use the original extension method as or you could simply call the the extension method here as: Which should hopefully make your code a bit more readable. Fluent one liner...Here I\'m using the DisplayAttribute which contains both the Name and Description properties.ExampleHere is code to get information from a Display attribute. It uses a generic method to retrieve the attribute. If the attribute is not found it converts the enum value to a string with pascal/camel case converted to title case (code obtained here)And this is the extension method for strings for converting to title case:Get the dictionary from enum.Now call this like...EnumDecription Ext MethodI implemented this extension method to get the description from enum values. It works for all kind of enums.Taking advantage of some of the newer C# language features, you can reduce the line count:Here\'s the .NET Core version of AdamCrawford\'s answer, using System.Reflection.TypeExtensions;This extension method will obtain a string representation of an enum value using its XmlEnumAttribute. If no XmlEnumAttribute is present, it falls back to enum.ToString().I this answer to setup a combo box from an enum attributes which was great. I then needed to code the reverse so that I can get the selection from the box and return the enum in the correct type.I also modified the code to handle the case where an attribute was missingFor the benefits of the next person, here is my final solution }Alternatively, you could do the following:And get the description with the following:In my opinion this is a more efficient way of doing what you want to accomplish, as no reflection is needed..Guys if it helps I will share with you my solution: \nDefinition of Custom attribute: Now because I needed it inside of HtmlHelper definition of HtmlHelper Extension: Hope it helpsAnd if you want the full list of names you can do something likeAdding my solution for Net Framework and NetCore.I used this for my Net Framework implementation:This doesn\'t work for NetCore so I modified it to do this:  Enumeration Example:  Sample Usage for either static added:  You can also define an enum value like Name_Without_Spaces, and when you want a description use Name_Without_Spaces.ToString().Replace(\'_\', \' \') to replace the underscores with spaces.
