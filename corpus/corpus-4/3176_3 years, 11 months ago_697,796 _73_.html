I have seen lots of jQuery examples where parameter size and name are unknown. My url is only going to ever have 1 string:I just want to detect:Best solution here.And this is how you can use this function assuming the URL is,\nhttp://dummy.com/?technology=jquery&blog=jquerybyexample. jQuery code snippet to get the dynamic variables stored in the url as parameters and store them as JavaScript variables ready for use with your scripts:example.com?param1=name&param2=&id=6example params with spacesI always stick this as one line. Now params has the vars:multi-lined:as a functionwhich you could use as:orMay be its too late. But this method is very easy and simpleUPDATE\nRequires the url plugin : plugins.jquery.com/url\nThanks -RipounetOr you can use this neat little function, because why overcomplicated solutions?which looks even better when simplified and onelined:You better see this answer: How can I get query string values in JavaScript?Sneak peakSolution from the 2017We have: http://example.com?sent=yesDoes sent exist?Is it equal to "yes"?and then just compare it.Yet another alternative function...Perhaps you might want to give Dentist JS a look?

It\'s also customizable to deal with delimiters and all.Minified version < 1kbThis one is simple and worked for me so if your url is http://www.yoursite.com?city=4try this There\'s this great library:\nhttps://github.com/allmarkedup/purlwhich allows you to do simplyThe example is assuming you\'re using jQuery. You could also use it just as plain javascript, the syntax would then be a little different.This might be overkill, but there is a pretty popular library now available for parsing URIs, called URI.js.This will give you a nice object to work withAnd then;I hope this will help.This is based on Gazoris\'s answer, but URL decodes the parameters so they can be used when they contain data other than numbers and letters:So simple you can use any url and get valueUsage ExampleNote: If a parameter is present several times (?first=value1&second=value2), you will get the first value (value1) and second value as (value2).There is another example with using URI.js library.Example answers the questions exactly as asked.Coffeescript version of Sameer\'s answerA slight improvement to Sameer\'s answer, cache params into closure to avoid parsing and looping through all parameters each time callingI use this and it works.\nhttp://codesheet.org/codesheet/NF246TzsWith vanilla JavaScript, you could easily take the params (location.search), get the substring (without the ?) and turn it into an array, by splitting it by \'&\'.  As you iterate through urlParams, you could then split the string again with \'=\' and add it to the \'params\' object as object[elmement[0]] = element[1].
