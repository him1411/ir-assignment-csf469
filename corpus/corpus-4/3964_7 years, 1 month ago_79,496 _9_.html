Is there a way to tell IntelliJ never to use wildcard imports?\nUnder \'Settings > Code Style > Imports\', I can see that you can specify the \'class count\' prior to IntelliJ using wildcard imports.  However, if I never want to use wildcard imports can I turn this functionality off?  I have tried putting -1 or leaving the field blank but that just tells IntelliJ to always use wildcard imports.  Obviously a not-so-nice solution would be to put a ridiculously high number so that you never encounter wildcard imports but I was hoping there was a nicer way to just turn it off.It\'s obvious why you\'d want to disable this: to force IntelliJ to include each and every import individually.  It makes it easier for people to figure out exactly where classes you\'re using come from.Click on the Settings "wrench" icon on the toolbar, open "Imports" under "Code Style", and check the "Use single class import" selection.  You can also completely remove entries under "Packages to use import with *", or specify a threshold value that only uses the "*" when the individual classes from a package exceeds that threshold.Update: in IDEA 13 "Use single class import" does not prevent wildcard imports. The solution is to go to Preferences (\xe2\x8c\x98 + , on macOS / Ctrl + Alt + S on Windows) > Editor > Code Style > Java > Imports tab set Class count to use import with \'*\' and Names count to use static import with \'*\' to a higher value. Any value over 99 seems to work fine.After this, your configuration should look like:\n(On IntelliJ IDEA 13.x, 14.x, 15.x, 2016.x, 2017.x)The solution above was not working for me. I had to set \'class count to use import with \'*\'\' to a high value, e.g. 999.If non of above works for you, then it is worth to check if you have any packages under Preference > Editor > Code Style > Java > Imports > Packages to Use Import with "*"
