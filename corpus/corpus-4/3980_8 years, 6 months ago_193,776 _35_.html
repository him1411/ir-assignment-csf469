In my PHP code, when deleting a client, I want to delete all projects\' posts:The posts table does not have a foreign key client_id, only project_id. I want to delete posts that are posted in projects that have the passed client_id.This is not working right now (no posts are deleted).You just need to specify that you want to delete the entries from the posts table:EDIT:  For more information you can see this alternative answerOr the same thing, with a slightly different (IMO friendlier) syntax:BTW, with mysql using joins is almost always a way faster than subqueries...Since you are selecting multiple tables, The table to delete from is no longer unambiguous. You need to select:In this case, table_name1 and table_name2 are the same table, so this will work:You can even delete from both tables if you wanted to:Note that order by and limit don\'t work for multi-table deletes.Also be aware that if you declare an alias for a table, you must use the alias when referring to the table:Contributions from Carpetsmoker and etc.You can also use ALIAS like this it works just used it on my database! t is the table need deleting from!I\'m more used to the subquery solution to this, but I have not tried it in MySQL:MySQL DELETE records with JOINYou generally use INNER JOIN in the SELECT statement to select records from a table that have corresponding records in other tables. We can also use the INNER JOIN clause with the DELETE statement to delete records from a table and also the corresponding records in other tables e.g., to delete records from both T1 and T2 tables that meet a particular condition, you use the following statement:Notice that you put table names T1 and T2 between DELETE and FROM. If you omit the T1 table, the DELETE statement only deletes records in the T2 table, and if you omit the T2 table, only records in the T1 table are deleted.The join condition T1.key = T2.key specifies the corresponding records in the T2 table that need be deleted.The condition in the WHERE clause specifies which records in the T1 and T2 that need to be deleted.Try like below: Single Table Delete:In order to delete entries from posts table:In order to delete entries from projects table:In order to delete entries from clients table:Multiple Tables Delete:In order to delete entries from multiple tables out of the joined results you need to specify the table names after DELETE as comma separated list:Suppose you want to delete entries from all the three tables (posts,projects,clients) for a particular client :DELETE records  FROM one table :DELETE RECORDS FROM both tables:Another method of deleting using a sub select that is better than using IN would be WHERE EXISTSOne reason to use this instead of the join is that a DELETE with JOIN forbids the use of LIMIT. If you wish to delete in blocks so as not to produce full table locks, you can add LIMIT use this DELETE WHERE EXISTS method.If join does not work for you you may try this solution. It is for deleting orphan records from t1 when not using foreign keys + specific where condition. I.e. it deletes records from table1, that have empty field "code" and that do not have records in table2, matching by field "name".Try this,-- Note that you can not use an alias over the table where you need delete
