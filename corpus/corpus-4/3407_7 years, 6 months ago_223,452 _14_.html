I want to change color of ListView separator line. Any help would be appreciated.You can set this value in a layout xml file using android:divider="#FF0000". If you are changing the colour/drawable, you have to set/reset the height of the divider too.Or you can code it:Hope it helpsFor a single color line use:It\'s important that DividerHeight is set after the divider, else you won\'t get anything.You can also get the colors from your resources by using:XML version for @Asher Aslan cool effect.Name for that shape as: list_driver.xml under drawable folderThere are two ways to doing the same:You may set the value of android:divider="#FFCCFF" in layout xml file. \nWith this you also have to specify height of divider like this android:dividerHeight="5px".You may also do this by programmatically...Use below code in your xml fileUse android:divider="#FF0000" and android:dividerHeight="2px" for ListView.
