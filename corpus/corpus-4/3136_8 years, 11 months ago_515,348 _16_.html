I\'m using C# on Framework 3.5.  I\'m looking to quickly sort a Generic List<>.  For the sake of this example lets say I have a List of a Person type with a property of lastname.  How would I sort this List using a lambda expression?If you mean an in-place sort (i.e. the list is updated):If you mean a new list:Do you need the list to be sorted in place, or just an ordered sequence of the contents of the list? The latter is easier:To sort in place, you\'d need an IComparer<Person> or a Comparison<Person>. For that, you may wish to consider ProjectionComparer in MiscUtil.(I know I keep bringing MiscUtil up - it just keeps being relevant...)you can use linq :) using :for me this useful dummy guide - Sorting in Generic List -   worked.\nit helps you to understand 4 ways(overloads) to do this job with very complete and clear explanations and simple examples You can use this code snippet:where New1 is a List<Employee>.EmpList is variable of a List<Employee>.z is a variable of Employee type.You can also useThis is a generic sorter. Called with the switch below.dvm.PagePermissions is a property on my ViewModel of type \n    List T in this case T is a EF6 model class called page_permission.dvm.UserNameSortDir is a string property on the viewmodel that holds the next sort direction.  The one that is actaully used in the view.
