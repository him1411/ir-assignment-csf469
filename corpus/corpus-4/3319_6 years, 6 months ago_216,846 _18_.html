Is it possible to select elements in CSS by their HTML5 data attributes (for example, data-role)?If you mean using an attribute selector, sure, why not:There are a variety of attribute selectors you can use for various scenarios which are all covered in the document I link to. Note that, despite custom data attributes being a "new HTML5 feature",browsers typically don\'t have any problems supporting non-standard attributes, so you should be able to filter them with attribute selectors; andyou don\'t have to worry about CSS validation either, as CSS doesn\'t care about non-namespaced attribute names as long as they don\'t break the selector syntax.It\'s also possible to select attributes regardless of their content, in modern browserswith:  For example: http://codepen.io/jasonm23/pen/fADnuWorks on a very significant percentage of browsers.Note this can also be used in a JQuery selector, or using document.querySelectorIt\'s worth noting CSS3 substring attribute selectorsYou can combine multiple selectors and this is so cool knowing that you can select every attribute and attribute based on their value like href based on their values with CSS only..Attributes selectors allows you play around some extra with id and class attributesHere is an awesome read on Attribute SelectorsFiddleBrowser support:\nIE6+, Chrome, Firefox & SafariYou can check detail here.
