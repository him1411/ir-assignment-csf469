I\'m having an issue with UITableView\'s didSelectRowAtIndexPath.My table is setup so that when I select row it initializes a new view controller and pushes it.The first time I tap any row in the table, the method does not get called. Once I select another row, it begins to work as normal.I have verified this by setting a breakpoint on didSelectRowAtIndexPath. When adding an NSLog to the method I see that when I select the second row that finally pushes the new view controller, I see two log statements appear in the console at the same time.Any suggestions?Any chance you accidentally typed didDeselectRowAtIndexPath?Also check the selection property of your table view in xib file. Use \'Single Selection\' or \'Multiple Selection\' as required.I experienced the following issue: In my case, my error was checking Show Selection on Touch in Interface Builder. You can uncheck it in IB here:Hope that helps someoneCheck If you have set any Gesture recognisers in your class. Removing gesture worked for me.I debated even posting this answer because I think the stars kind of aligned in order for this to manifest itself. I am having a variation of this problem and have checked the other solutions. On my table view it isn\'t processing the very last row of my table on the first tap. It highlights it, but didSelectRowAtIndexPath isn\'t being called. All the other rows work fine. But if I turn the tableview bounce on then it seems to solve the problem (but then you have to deal with a tableview bounce).UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone was set for the cell displaying that problem\n(ios9).I have ended up calling     first thing inwhich is not the same, but is good enough.\nmakes me wonder what kind of table breakage ios10 brings.SWIFT 2Make sure you have this set to true: self.tableView.allowsSelection = truePut this above your right after your viewDidLoad() and before the super.viewDidLoad()SWIFT 3If you are working with Swift 3 in a class which isn\'t a UITableViewController and you are using UITableViewDelegate, then you may need to use the method title: This worked for me, although I have just migrated my project to Swift 3. It\'s fairly new so this may be fixed later.didSelectRowAt function was not called in my app in first or second tap...\nI was trying to solve the problem could not find any solution. But suddenly \xc4\xb1 was recognise, I was using view.animation color change... Delegate method was not called while animation persist
