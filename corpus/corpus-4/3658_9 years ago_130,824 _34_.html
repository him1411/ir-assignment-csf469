I want to make a copy of an activerecord record, changing a single field in the process (in addition to the id).  What is the simplest way to accomplish this?I realize I could create a new record, and then iterate over each of the fields copying the data field-by-field - but I figured there must be an easier way to do this...such as:To get a copy, use the clone (or dup for rails 3.1) method:Then you can change whichever fields you want.ActiveRecord overrides the built-in Object#clone to give you a new (not saved to the DB) record with an unassigned ID.\nNote that it does not copy associations, so you\'ll have to do this manually if you need to.Rails 3.1 clone is a shallow copy, use dup instead...Depending on your needs and programming style, you can also use a combination of the new method of the class and merge. For lack of a better simple example, suppose you have a task scheduled for a certain date and you want to duplicate it to another date. The actual attributes of the task aren\'t important, so:will create a new task with :id => nil, :scheduled_on => some_new_date, and all other attributes the same as the original task. Using Task.new, you will have to explicitly call save, so if you want it saved automatically, change Task.new to Task.create.Peace. You may also like the Amoeba gem for ActiveRecord 3.2.In your case, you probably want to make use of the nullify, regex or prefix options available in the configuration DSL.It supports easy and automatic recursive duplication of has_one, has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many associations, field preprocessing and a highly flexible and powerful configuration DSL that can be applied both to the model and on the fly.be sure to check out the Amoeba Documentation but usage is pretty easy...justor add to your Gemfilethen add the amoeba block to your model and run the dup method as usualYou can also control which fields get copied in numerous ways, but for example, if you wanted to prevent comments from being duplicated but you wanted to maintain the same tags, you could do something like this:You can also preprocess fields to help indicate uniqueness with both prefixes and suffixes as well as regexes. In addition, there are also numerous options so you can write in the most readable style for your purpose:Recursive copying of associations is easy, just enable amoeba on child models as wellThe configuration DSL has yet more options, so be sure to check out the documentation.Enjoy! :)Use ActiveRecord::Base#dup if you don\'t want to copy the idI usually just copy the attributes, changing whatever I need changing:If you need a deep copy with associations, I recommend the deep_cloneable gem.The easily way is:Or You can also check the acts_as_inheritable gem."Acts As Inheritable is a Ruby Gem specifically written for Rails/ActiveRecord models. It is meant to be used with the Self-Referential Association, or with a model having a parent that share the inheritable attributes. This will let you inherit any attribute or relation from the parent model."By adding acts_as_inheritable to your models you will have access to these methods:inherit_attributesinherit_relationsHope this can help you.
