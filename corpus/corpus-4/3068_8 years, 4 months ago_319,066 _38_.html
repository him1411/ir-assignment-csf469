I have a WCF Service which returns 1000 records from database to the client. I have an ASP.NET WCF client (I have added service reference in asp.net web application project to consume WCF). I get the following message when I run the client application:The maximum message size quota for incoming messages (65536) has been\n  exceeded. To increase the quota, use\n  the MaxReceivedMessageSize property on\n  the appropriate binding element.Any help? How to increase message size quota?You\'ll want something like this to increase the message size quotas, in the App.config or Web.config file:And use the binding name in your endpoint configuration e.g.The justification for the values is simple, they are sufficiently large to accommodate most messages. You can tune that number to fit your needs. The low default value is basically there to prevent DOS type attacks. Making it 20000000 would allow for a distributed DOS attack to be effective, the default size of 64k would require a very large number of clients to overpower most servers these days.If you\'re still getting this error message while using the WCF Test Client, it\'s because the client has a separate MaxBufferSize setting.   To correct the issue:A list of editable settings will appear, including MaxBufferSize.Note: Auto-generated proxy clients also set MaxBufferSize to 65536 by default. If you are creating your WCF bindings dynamically here\'s the code to use:The WCF Test Client has it\'s own client config. Run the test client and scroll to the bottom. \nIf you double click the Config File node you will see the XML representation. As you can see the maxReceivedMessageSize is 65536. To edit this, Right Click the Config File tree node and select Edit With SvcConfigEditor. \nWhen the editor opens expand Bindings and double click the binding that was automatically generated. You can edit all the properties here, including maxReceivedMessageSize. When you are done click File - Save. Lastly, when you are back at the WCF Test Client window, click Tools - Options.NOTE: Uncheck the Always regenerate config when launching services.I found the easy way --- right click the webconfig or app config file and click EDIT WCF CONFIGURATION and got to bingdigs ans select yore service and right\n  side show maxReciveMessageSize give a large number ---I solve the problem ...as follows \n  I solved my issue on Bing Maps WPF on my project Using CalculateRoute ().\nThe solution in my case was setting the maxReceivedMessageSize and maxReceivedMessageSize on attribute "httpTransport" for "customBinding" section .I set in the applications.config file (es. myApp.config) this configuration:Don\'t forget that the app.config of the execution entry point will be considered, not the one in class library project managing Web-Service calls if there is one.For example if you get the error while running unit test, you need to set up appropriate config in the testing project.Another important thing to consider from my experience..I would strongly advice NOT to maximize maxBufferPoolSize, because buffers from the pool are never released until the app-domain (ie the Application Pool) recycles.A period of high traffic could cause a lot of memory to be used and never released.More details here:i got this error when using this settings on web.configi set settings like this:For HTTP:For TCP:IMPORTANT:If you try to pass complex object that has many connected objects (e.g: a tree data structure, a list that has many objects...), the communication will fail no matter how you increased the Quotas.\nIn such cases, you must increase the containing objects count:
