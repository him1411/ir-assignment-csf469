I came from Java, and now I am working more with Ruby. One language feature I am not familiar with is the module. I am wondering what exactly is a module and when do you use one, and why use a module over a class?The first answer is good and gives some structural answers, but another approach is to think about what you\'re doing. Modules are about providing methods that you can use across multiple classes - think about them as "libraries" (as you would see in a Rails app). Classes are about objects; modules are about functions.For example, authentication and authorization systems are good examples of modules. Authentication systems work across multiple app-level classes (users are authenticated, sessions manage authentication, lots of other classes will act differently based on the auth state), so authentication systems act as shared APIs. You might also use a module when you have shared methods across multiple apps (again, the library model is good here). I\'m surprised anyone hasn\'t said this yet.Since the asker came from a Java background (and so did I), here\'s an analogy that helps.Classes are simply like Java classes.Modules are like Java static classes. Think about Math class in Java. You don\'t instantiate it, and you reuse the methods in the static class (eg. Math.random()). Basically, the module cannot be instantiated. When a class includes a module, a proxy superclass is generated that provides access to all the module methods as well as the class methods.A module can be included by multiple classes. Modules cannot be inherited, but this "mixin" model provides a useful type of "multiple inheritrance". OO purists will disagree with that statement, but don\'t let purity get in the way of getting the job done.(This answer originally linked to http://www.rubycentral.com/pickaxe/classes.html, but that link and its domain are no longer active.)Module in Ruby, to a degree, corresponds to Java abstract class -- has instance methods, classes can inherit from it (via include, Ruby guys call it a "mixin"), but has no instances. There are other minor differences, but this much information is enough to get you started.source (You can learn the characteristics of module from there)A Module is a collection of methods and constants. The methods in a module may be instance methods or module methods. Instance methods appear as methods in a class when the module is included, module methods do not. Conversely, module methods may be called without creating an encapsulating object, while instance methods may not. Bottom line: A module is a cross between a static/utility class and a mixin.Mixins are reusable pieces of "partial" implementation, that can be combined (or composed) in a mix & match fashion, to help write new classes.  These classes can additionally have their own state and/or code, of course.
