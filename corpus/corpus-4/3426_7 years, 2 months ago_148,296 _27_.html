For example:What exactly does the > sign mean?> is the child combinator, sometimes mistakenly called the direct descendant combinator.1That means the selector div > p.some_class only selects paragraphs of .some_class that are nested directly inside a div, and not any paragraphs that are nested further within.An illustration:What\'s selected and what\'s not:Selected\nThis p.some_class is located directly inside the div, hence a parent-child relationship is established between both elements.Not selected\nThis p.some_class is contained by a blockquote within the div, rather than the div itself. Although this p.some_class is a descendant of the div, it\'s not a child; it\'s a grandchild.Consequently, while div > p.some_class won\'t match this element, div p.some_class will, using the descendant combinator instead.1 Many people go further to call it "direct child" or "immediate child", but that\'s completely unnecessary (and incredibly annoying to me), because a child element is immediate by definition anyway, so they mean the exact same thing. There\'s no such thing as an "indirect child".As others mention, it\'s a child selector. Here\'s the appropriate link.http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#child-selectors It matches p elements with class some_class that are directly under a div.> (greater-than sign) is a CSS Combinator.A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.  A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.There are four different combinators in CSS3:Note: < is not valid in CSS selectors.  For example: Output: CourtesyAll p tags with class some_class which are direct children of a div tag.All the direct children that are <p> with .some_class would get the style applied to them.( child selector) was introduced in css2.\n  div p{ }  select all p elements decedent of div elements, whereas div > p selects only child p elements, not grand child, great grand child on so on.
