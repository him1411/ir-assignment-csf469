Why do all the C files written by my lecturer start with a #?I\'m going through some C course notes, and every C program source file begins with a single # on the first line of the program.Then there are blank spaces, and following that other stuff followed by the main function.What is the reason for the #?(It\'s out of term now and I can\'t really ask the chap.)Here\'s an example (there is an extra line at the end of the closing })Wow, this requirement goes way back to the 1970s.In the very early days of pre-standardised C, if you wanted to invoke the preprocessor, then you had to write a # as the first thing in the first line of a source file. Writing only a # at the top of the file affords flexibility in the placement of the other preprocessor directives.From an original C draft by the great Dennis Ritchie himself:[...] In order to cause [the] preprocessor to be invoked, it is necessary that the very\n  first line of the program begin with #. Since null lines are ignored by the preprocessor, this line need contain no other\n  information.That document makes for great reading (and allowed me to jump on this question like a mad cat).I suspect it\'s the lecturer simply being sentimental - it hasn\'t been required certainly since ANSI C.
