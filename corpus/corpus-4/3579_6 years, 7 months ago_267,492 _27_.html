I need to create a box-shadow on some block element, but only (for example) on its right side. The way I do it is to wrap the inner element with box-shadow into an outer one with padding-right and overflow:hidden; so the three other sides of the shadow are not visible.Is there some better way to achieve this? Like box-shadow-right?EDIT: My intentions are to create only the vertical part of the shadow. Exactly the same as what repeat-y of the rule background:url(shadow.png) 100% 0% repeat-y would do.Yes, you can use the shadow spread property of the box-shadow rule: The fourth property there -2px is the shadow spread, you can use it to change the spread of the shadow, making it appear that the shadow is on one side only. This also uses the shadow positioning rules 10px sends it to the right (horizontal offset) and 0px keeps it under the element (vertical offset.) 5px is the blur radius :)Example for you here.My self-made solution which is easy to edit:HTML:  css:  Demo:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/jDyQt/103To get the clipped effect on up to two sides you can use pseudo elements with background gradients.will add a nice shadow-like effect to the left and right of the elements that normally make up a document.Here\'s a little hack that I did.1. Create a <div class="one_side_shadow"></div> right below the element that I want to create the one-side box shadow (in this case I want a one-sided inset shadow for id="element" coming from the bottom)2. Then I created a regular box-shadow using a negative vertical offset to push the shadow upwards to one-side. This could be a simple wayAssign this to any divJust use ::after or ::before pseudo element to add the shadow. Make it 1px and position it on whatever side you want. Below is example of top.Here is my example:This site helped me: https://gist.github.com/ocean90/1268328 (Note that on that site the left and right are reversed as of the date of this post... but they work as expected). They are corrected in the code below.What I do is create a vertical block for the shadow, and place it next to where my block element should be. The two blocks are then wrapped into another block:jsFiddle example here.
