Being a newbie in R, I\'m not very sure how to choose the best number of clusters to do a k-means analysis. After plotting a subset of below data, how many clusters will be appropriate? How can I perform cluster dendro analysis?If your question is how can I determine how many clusters are appropriate for a kmeans analysis of my data?, then here are some options. The wikipedia article on determining numbers of clusters has a good review of some of these methods.First, some reproducible data (the data in the Q are... unclear to me):One. Look for a bend or elbow in the sum of squared error (SSE) scree plot. See http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cluster.html & http://www.mattpeeples.net/kmeans.html for more. The location of the elbow in the resulting plot suggests a suitable number of clusters for the kmeans:We might conclude that 4 clusters would be indicated by this method:\nTwo. You can do partitioning around medoids to estimate the number of clusters using the pamk function in the fpc package. \nThree. Calinsky criterion: Another approach to diagnosing how many clusters suit the data. In this case we try 1 to 10 groups.Four. Determine the optimal model and number of clusters according to the Bayesian Information Criterion for expectation-maximization, initialized by hierarchical clustering for parameterized Gaussian mixture models\n\nFive. Affinity propagation (AP) clustering, see http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1136800\nSix. Gap Statistic for Estimating the Number of Clusters. See also some code for a nice graphical output. Trying 2-10 clusters here:Here\'s the output from Edwin Chen\'s implementation of the gap statistic:\nSeven. You may also find it useful to explore your data with clustergrams to visualize cluster assignment, see http://www.r-statistics.com/2010/06/clustergram-visualization-and-diagnostics-for-cluster-analysis-r-code/ for more details. Eight. The NbClust package provides 30 indices to determine the number of clusters in a dataset.If your question is how can I produce a dendrogram to visualize the results of my cluster analysis, then you should start with these:\nhttp://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cluster.html\nhttp://www.r-tutor.com/gpu-computing/clustering/hierarchical-cluster-analysis\nhttp://gastonsanchez.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/7-ways-to-plot-dendrograms-in-r/ And see here for more exotic methods: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Cluster.htmlHere are a few examples:Also for high-dimension data is the pvclust library which calculates p-values for hierarchical clustering via multiscale bootstrap resampling. Here\'s the example from the documentation (wont work on such low dimensional data as in my example): Does any of that help?It\'s hard to add something too such an elaborate answer. Though I feel we should mention identify here, particularly because @Ben shows a lot of dendrogram examples. identify lets you interactively choose clusters from an dendrogram and stores your choices to a list. Hit Esc to leave interactive mode and return to R console. Note, that the list contains the indices, not the rownames (as opposed to cutree).In order to determine optimal k-cluster in clustering methods. I usually using Elbow method accompany by Parallel processing to avoid time-comsuming. This code can sample like this:Elbow methodRunning Elbow parallelIt works well.Splendid answer from Ben. However I\'m surprised that the Affinity Propagation (AP) method has been here suggested just to find the number of cluster for the k-means method, where in general AP do a better job clustering the data. Please see the scientific paper supporting this method in Science here:Frey, Brendan J., and Delbert Dueck. "Clustering by passing messages between data points." science 315.5814 (2007): 972-976.So if you are not biased toward k-means I suggest to use AP directly, which will cluster the data without requiring knowing the number of clusters:If negative euclidean distances are not appropriate, then you can use another similarity measures provided in the same package. For example, for similarities based on Spearman correlations, this is what you need:Please note that those functions for similarities in the AP package are just provided for simplicity. In fact, apcluster() function in R will accept any matrix of correlations. The same before with corSimMat() can be done with this:or depending on what you want to cluster on your matrix (rows or cols).The answers are great. If you want to give a chance to another clustering method you can use hierarchical clustering and see how data is splitting.Depending on how many classes you need you can cut your dendrogram as;If you type ?cutree you will see the definitions. If your data set has three classes it will be simply cutree(hc.complete, k = 3). The equivalent for cutree(hc.complete,k = 2) is cutree(hc.complete,h = 4.9).
