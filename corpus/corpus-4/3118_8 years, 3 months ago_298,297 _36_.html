Is there a way to have multiple lines of text in UILabel like in the UITextView or should I use the second one instead?I found a solution.One just has to add the following code:Restored old answer (for reference and devs willing to support iOS below 6.0):On the side: both enum values yield to 0 anyway.In IB, set number of lines to 0 (allows unlimited lines)When typing within the text field using IB, use "alt-return" to insert a return and go to the next line (or you can copy in text already separated out by lines).The best solution I have found (to an otherwise frustrating problem that should have been solved in the framework) is similar to vaychick\'s.Just set number of lines to 0 in either IB or codeThis will display the lines needed but will reposition the label so its centered horizontally (so that a 1 line and 3 line label are aligned in their horizontal position). To fix that add:Use this to have multiple lines of text in UILabel:Swift:If you have to use the: property you can also use a standard line break ("\\n"), in code, to force a new line.You can use \\r to go to next line while filling up the UILabel using NSString.lets try thisThe solution above does\'t work in my case. I\'m doing like this:Use story borad : select the label  to set number of lines to zero......Or Refer this For some reasons its not working for me in iOS 6 not sure why. Tried it with and without attributed text. Any suggestions.you should try this:You can do that via the Storyboard too: Already answered, but you can do it manually in the storyboard too. Under Attributes Inspector for the Label, you can change Line Breaks to Word Wrap (or character wrap).I agree with Jarred Olson, NSLineBreakByWordWrapping is default.\nI added property sizeToFit like the guide of Gurumoorthy Arumugam to fix it.If you want the font inside your label to adjust itself to fit into the boundaries of the label. You can use :Thanks all.These things helped me Change these properties of UILabel And while giving input String use \\n to display different words in different lines.Example :In this function pass string that you want to assign in label and pass font size in place of  self.activityFont and pass label width in  place of 235, now you get label height according to your string.\nit will work fine. Set below either in code or in storyboard itselfLabel.lineBreakMode = NSLineBreakByWordWrapping;\nLabel.numberOfLines = 0;and please don\'t forget to set left, right, top and bottom constraints for label otherwise it won\'t work.Swift 3\nHere is solution with swift 3. Just copy & execute this code to see resultThis code is returning size height according to text
