What is the difference between "screen" and "only screen" in media queries?Why are we required to use \'Only\'. Does screen not itself provide enough information to be rendered only for Screen? I\'ve seen many responsive websites. Some useSome and someLet\'s break down your examples one by one.This one is saying for a window with a max-width of 632px that you want to apply these styles. At that size you would be talking about anything smaller than a desktop screen in most cases. This one is saying for a device with a screen and a window with max-width of 632px apply the style. This is almost identical to the above except you are specifying screen as opposed to the other available media types  the most common other one being print.Here is a quote straight from W3C to explain this one.The keyword \xe2\x80\x98only\xe2\x80\x99 can also be used to hide style sheets from older user agents. User   agents must process media queries starting with \xe2\x80\x98only\xe2\x80\x99 as if the \xe2\x80\x98only\xe2\x80\x99 keyword was not present.As there is no such media type as "only", the style sheet should be ignored by older browsers.Here\'s the link to that quote that is shown in example 9 on that page.Hopefully this sheds some light on media queries.EDIT:Be sure to check out @hybrids excellent answer on how the only keyword is really handled.The following is from Adobe docs.The media queries specification also provides the keyword only, which is intended to hide media queries from older browsers. Like not, the keyword must come at the beginning of the declaration. For example:Browsers that don\'t recognize media queries expect a comma-separated list of media types, and the specification says they should truncate each value immediately before the first nonalphanumeric character that isn\'t a hyphen. So, an old browser should interpret the preceding example as this:Because there is no such media type as only, the stylesheet is ignored. Similarly, an old browser should interpret as In other words, it should apply the style rules to all screen devices, even though it doesn\'t know what the media queries mean.Unfortunately, IE 6\xe2\x80\x938 failed to implement the specification correctly.Instead of applying the styles to all screen devices, it ignores the style sheet altogether.In spite of this behavior, it\'s still recommended to prefix media queries with only if you want to hide the styles from other, less common browsers.So, using andwill have the same effect in IE6-8: both will prevent those styles from being used. They will, however, still be downloaded.Also, in browsers that support CSS3 media queries, both versions will load the styles if the viewport width is larger than 401px and the media type is screen.I\'m not entirely sure which browsers that don\'t support CSS3 media queries would need the only versionas opposed toto make sure it is not interpreted asIt would be a good test for someone with access to a device lab.To style for many smartphones with smaller screens, you could write:To block older browsers from seeing an iPhone or Android phone style sheet, you could write:Read this article for more http://webdesign.about.com/od/css3/a/css3-media-queries.htmAnswer by @hybrid is quite informative , except i doesn\'t explains the purpose as mentioned by @ashitaka  "What if you use the Mobile First approach? So, we have the mobile css first and then use min-width to target larger sites. We shouldn\'t use the only keyword in that context, right? "Want to add in here that the purpose is simply to prevent non supporting browsers to use that Other device style as if it starts from "screen" without it will take it for screen where as if it starts from "only" style will be ignored.Answering to ashitaka consider this exampleIf we don\'t use "only" it will still work as desktop style will also be used striking android styles but with unnecessary overhead. In this case IF a browser is non supporting it will fallback to second Style-sheet ignoring the first.
