Being somewhat new to the Java language I\'m trying to familiarize myself with all the ways (or at least the non-pathological ones) that one might iterate through a list (or perhaps other collections) and the advantages or disadvantages of each. Given a List<E> list object, I know of the following ways to loop through all elements:Note: As @amarseillan pointed out, this form is a poor choice\nfor iterating over Lists because the actual implementation of\nthe get method may not be as efficient as when using an Iterator.\nFor example, LinkedList implementations must traverse all of\nthe elements preceding i to get the i-th element.\nIn the above example there\'s no way for the List implementation to\n"save its place" to make future iterations more efficient. \nFor an ArrayList it doesn\'t really matter because the complexity/cost of get is constant time (O(1)) whereas for a LinkedList is it proportional to the size of the list (O(n)). \nFor more information about the computational complexity of the built-in Collections implementations, check out this question.EDIT: Added ListIteratorEDIT: Added "functional-style" solution (thanks Dave Newton)EDIT: Added map method from Java 8\'s Stream API (see @i_am_zero\'s answer)In Java 8 collection classes that implement Iterable (for example all Lists) now have a forEach method, which can be used instead of the for loop statement demonstrated above. (Here is another question that provides a good comparison.)What other ways are there, if any?I feel like this has got to be a duplicate, but I haven\'t been able to find what I\'m looking for, so I apologize for this question potentially being redundant.\n(BTW, my interest does not stem at all from a desire to optimize performance; I just want to know what forms are available to me as a developer.)EDIT: Moved ListIterationExample.java to a suggested answerThe three forms of looping are nearly identical. The enhanced for loop:is, according to the Java Language Specification, identical in effect to the explicit use of an iterator with a traditional for loop. In the third case, you can only modify the list contents by removing the current element, and then only if you do it through the remove method of the iterator itself. With index-based iteration, you are free to modify the list in any way. However, adding or removing elements that come before the current index risks having your loop skipping elements or processing the same element multiple times; you need to adjust the loop index properly when you make such changes.In all cases, element is a reference to the actual list element. None of the iteration methods makes a copy of anything in the list. Changes to the internal state of element will always be seen in the internal state of the corresponding element on the list.Essentially, there only two ways to iterate over a list: by using an index or by using an iterator. The enhanced for loop is just a syntactic shortcut introduced in Java 5 to avoid the tedium of explicitly defining an iterator. For both styles, you can come up with essentially trivial variations using for, while or do while blocks, but they all boil down to the same thing (or, rather, two things).EDIT: As @iX3 points out in a comment, you can use a ListIterator to set the current element of a list as you are iterating. You would need to use List#listIterator() instead of List#iterator() to initialize the loop variable (which, obviously, would have to be declared a ListIterator rather than an Iterator).Example of each kind listed in the question:A JDK8-style iteration:The basic loop is not recommended as you do not know the implementation of the list.If that was a LinkedList, each call to would be iterating over the list, resulting in N^2 time complexity.I don\'t know what you consider pathological, but let me provide some alternatives you could have not seen before:Or its recursive version:Also, a recursive version of the classical for(int i=0... :I mention them because you are "somewhat new to Java" and this could be interesting.In Java 8 collection classes that implement Iterable (for example all lists) now have forEach method:The above example makes use of method-reference introduced in Java 8. We can also iterate over a list using Stream as:The advantage with later option is that we can also make use of parallel streams wherever appropriate. If the objective is only to print the items irrespective of the order then we can use parallel stream as:For a backward search you should use the following:If you want to know a position, use iterator.previousIndex(). It also helps to write an inner loop that compares two positions in the list (iterators are not equal).Right, many alternatives listed, the easiest and cleanest would be just using the enhanced for statement as below, the Expression is of some type that is iterable. For example, to iterate through, List ids, we can simply so, You could always switch out the first and third examples with a while loop and a little more code. This gives you the advantage of being able to use the do-while:Of course, this kind of thing might cause a NullPointerException if the list.size() returns 0, becuase it always gets executed at least once. This can be fixed by testing if element is null before using its attributes / methods tho. Still, it\'s a lot simpler and easier to use the for loop
