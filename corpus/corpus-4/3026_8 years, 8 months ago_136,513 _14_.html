But what does it mean when a variable name is prefixed with the @ symbol?The @ symbol allows you to use reserved word.  For example:The above works, when the below wouldn\'t:The @ symbol serves 2 purposes in C#:Firstly, it allows you to use a reserved keyword as a variable like this:The second option lets you specify a string without having to escape any characters. For instance the \'\\\' character is an escape character so typically you would need to do this:alternatively you can do this:An important point that the other answers forgot, is that "@keyword" is compiled into "keyword" in the CIL.So if you have a framework that was made in, say, F#, which requires you to define a class with a property named "class", you can actually do it.It is not that useful in practice, but not having it would prevent C# from some forms of language interop.I usually see it used not for interop, but to avoid the keyword restrictions (usually on local variable names, where this is the only effect) ie.but I would strongly discourage that! Just find another name, even if the \'best\' name for the variable is one of the reserved names.It allows you to use a C# keyword as a variable.  For example:
