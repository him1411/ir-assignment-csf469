What is the best comment in source code you have ever encountered?I am particularly guilty of this, embedding non-constructive comments, code poetry and little jokes into most of my projects (although I usually have enough sense to remove anything directly offensive before releasing the code). Here\'s one I\'m particulary fond of, placed far, far down a poorly-designed \'God Object\':I\'M SORRY!!!! I just couldn\'t help myself.....!And another, which I\'ll admit I haven\'t actually released into the wild, even though I am very tempted to do so in one of my less intuitive classes:This seems to stop morons from messing my code...Update:  The original author of the code has outed himself so I must give credit where it is due. Dan McKinley left the company I was with shortly after I started, and he talks more about the code, explaining some background and a few more "WTF\'s" that \'Richard\' wrote.Wish I were kidding.  And knowing the developer who wrote the code, I think he meant it literally.\n    #define TRUE FALSE\n    //Happy debugging suckers\nfollowed by four nested for-loopsIt speaks volumes about our profession that when asked about the "best comment", we all answer with the worst comments we can find...Never rely on a comment...
