I\'ve been asked to update some Excel 2003 macros, but the VBA projects are password protected, and it seems there\'s a lack of documentation... no-one knows the passwords.Is there a way of removing or cracking the password on a VBA project?You can try this direct VBA approach which doesn\'t require HEX editing. It will work for any files (*.xls, *.xlsm, *.xlam ...). Tested and works on Excel 2007\n    Excel 2010\n    Excel 2013 - 32 bit version.\n    Excel 2016 - 32 bit version.Looking for 64 bit version? See https://stackoverflow.com/a/31005696/4342479 how it worksI will try my best to explain how it works - please excuse my english.using the codeCreate a new xlsm file and store this code in Module1code credited to Siwtom (nick name), a Vietnamese developer Paste this code in Module2 and run itCome back to your VBA Projects and enjoy.Yes there is, as long as you are using a .xls format spreadsheet (the default for Excel up to 2003).  For Excel 2007 onwards, the default is .xlsx, which is a fairly secure format, and this method will not work.As Treb says, it\'s a simple comparison. One method is to simply swap out the password entry in the file using a hex editor (see Hex editors for Windows).  Step by step example:Copy the lines starting with the following keys:FIRST BACKUP the excel file you don\'t know the VBA password for, then open it with your hex editor, and paste the above copied lines from the dummy file.If you need to work with Excel 2007 or 2010, there are some other answers below which might help, particularly these: 1, 2, 3.EDIT Feb 2015: for another method that looks very promising, look at this new answer by \xc4\x90\xe1\xbb\xa9c Thanh Nguy\xe1\xbb\x85n. There is another (somewhat easier) solution, without the size problems. I used this approach today (on a 2003 XLS file, using Excel 2007) and was successful. *NOTE: Be sure that you have changed the password to a new value, otherwise the next time you open the spreadsheet Excel will report errors (Unexpected Error), then when you access the list of VBA modules you will now see the names of the source modules but receive another error when trying to open forms/code/etc.  To remedy this, go back to the VBA Project Properties and set the password to a new value.  Save and re-open the Excel document and you should be good to go!I\'ve built upon \xc4\x90\xe1\xbb\xa9c Thanh Nguy\xe1\xbb\x85n\'s fantastic answer to allow this method to work with 64-bit versions of Excel. I\'m running Excel 2010 64-Bit on 64-Bit Windows 7.Create a new xlsm file and store this code in Module1Paste this code in Module2 and run itDISCLAIMER This worked for me and I have documented it here in the hope it will help someone out. I have not fully tested it. Please be sure to save all open files before proceeding with this option.Colin Pickard has an excellent answer, but there is one \'watch out\' with this.  There are instances (I haven\'t figured out the cause yet) where the total length of the "CMG=........GC=...." entry in the file is different from one excel file to the next.  In some cases, this entry will be 137 bytes, and in others it will be 143 bytes.  The 137 byte length is the odd one, and if this happens when you create your file with the \'1234\' password, just create another file, and it should jump to the 143 byte length.If you try to paste the wrong number of bytes into the file, you will lose your VBA project when you try to open the file with Excel.EDITThis is not valid for Excel 2007/2010 files.  The standard .xlsx file format is actually a .zip file containing numerous sub-folders with the formatting, layout, content, etc, stored as xml data.  For an unprotected Excel 2007 file, you can just change the .xlsx extension to .zip, then open the zip file and look through all the xml data.  It\'s very straightforward.However, when you password protect an Excel 2007 file, the entire .zip (.xlsx) file is actually encrypted using RSA encryption.  It is no longer possible to change the extension to .zip and browse the file contents.  It\'s worth pointing out that if you have an Excel 2007 (xlsm) file, then you can simply save it as an Excel 2003 (xls) file and use the methods outlined in other answers.For an .xlsm you need to do it a slightly different way.Have you tried simply opening them in OpenOffice.org? I had a similar problem some time ago and found that Excel and Calc didn\'t understand each other\'s encryption, and so allowed direct access to just about everything. This was a while ago, so if that wasn\'t just a fluke on my part it also may have been patched.For Excel 2007 onward you need to change your file extension to .zip\nIn the archive there is a subfolder xl, in there you will find vbaProject.bin.\nFollow the step above with vbaProject.bin then save it back in the archive.\nModify back your extension and voil\xc3\xa0! (meaning follow steps above)Colin Pickard is mostly correct, but don\'t confuse the "password to open" protection for the entire file with the VBA password protection, which is completely different from the former and is the same for Office 2003 and 2007 (for Office 2007, rename the file to .zip and look for the vbaProject.bin inside the zip). And that technically the correct way to edit the file is to use a OLE compound document viewer like CFX to open up the correct stream. Of course,  if you are just replacing bytes, the plain old binary editor may work.BTW, if you are wondering about the exact format of these fields, they have it documented now:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd926151%28v=office.12%29.aspxIn the event that your block of \nCMG="XXXX"\\r\\nDPB="XXXXX"\\r\\nGC="XXXXXX"\nin your \'known password\' file is shorter than the existing block in the \'unknown password\' file, pad your hex strings with trailing zeros to reach the correct length.e.g.CMG="xxxxxx"\\r\\nDPB="xxxxxxxx"\\r\\nGC="xxxxxxxxxx"in the unknown password file, should be set toCMG="XXXX00"\\r\\nDPB="XXXXX000"\\r\\nGC="XXXXXX0000" to preserve file length.I have also had this working with .XLA (97/2003 format) files in office 2007.If the file is a valid zip file (the first few bytes are 50 4B -- used in formats like .xlsm), then unzip the file and look for the subfile xl/vbaProject.bin.  This is a CFB file just like the .xls files.  Follow the instructions for the XLS format (applied to the subfile) and then just zip the contents.For the XLS format, you can follow some of the other methods in this post.  I personally prefer searching for the DPB= block and replacing the text with blank spaces.  This obviates CFB container size issues.Tom - I made a schoolboy error initially as I didn\'t watch the byte size and instead I copied and pasted from the "CMG" set up to the subsequent entry. This was two different text sizes between the two files, though, and I lost the VBA project just as Stewbob warned.Using HxD, there is a counter tracking how much file you\'re selecting. Copy starting from CMG until the counter reads 8F (hex for 143) and likewise when pasting into the locked file - I ended up with twice the number of "..." at the end of the paste, which looked odd somehow and felt almost unnatural, but it worked. I don\'t know if it is crucial, but I made sure I shut both the hex editor and excel down before reopening the file in Excel. I then had to go through the menus to open the VB Editor, into VBProject Properties and entered in the \'new\' password to unlock the code.I hope this helps.ElcomSoft makes Advanced Office Password Breaker and Advanced Office Password Recovery products which may apply to this case, as long as the document was created in Office 2007 or prior.My tool, VbaDiff, reads VBA directly from the file, so you can use it to recover protected VBA code from most office documents without resorting to a hex editor.The protection is a simple text comparison in Excel.\nLoad Excel in your favourite debugger (Ollydbg being my tool of choice), find the code that does the comparison and fix it to always return true, this should let you access the macros.your excel file\'s extension change to xml.\nAnd open it in notepad.\npassword text find in xml file.you see like below line;(sorry for my bad english)I tried some of solutions above and none of them works for me (excel 2007 xlsm file). Then i found another solution that even retrieve password, not just crack it.Insert this code into module, run it and give it some time. It will recover your password by brute force.
