I made some updates on my local machine, pushed them to a remote repository, and now I\'m trying to pull the changes to the server and I get the message;So I ran git checkout -- wp-content/w3tc-config/master.php and tried again and I get the same message. I\'m assuming that w3tc changed something in the config file on the server. I don\'t care whether the local copy or remote copy goes on the server (I suppose the remote one is best), I just want to be able to merge the rest of my changes (plugin updates).Any ideas?You can\'t merge with local modifications. Git protects you from losing potentially important changes.You have three options. Stashing acts as a stack, where you can push changes, and you pop them in reverse order.To stash type:Do the merge, and then pull the stash:using git reset --hard.\n or git checkout -t -f remote/branchusing git checkout filenameFirst command store your changes temporarily and discard those changes from working directory Second command you can pull / switch branches  Third command to restore the important changes which you have discarded temporarily. (--index option is useful for those files are not staged are being upstaged) Refer Git - StashingYou can try one of the following methods:For simple changes try rebasing on top of it while pulling the changes, e.g.So it\'ll apply your current branch on top of the upstream branch after fetching.This is equivalent to: checkout master, fetch and rebase origin/master git commands.This is a potentially dangerous mode of operation. It rewrites history, which does not bode well when you published that history already. Do not use this option unless you have read git-rebase(1) carefully.If you don\'t care about your local changes, you can switch to other branch temporary (with force), and switch it back, e.g.If you don\'t care about your local changes, try to reset it to HEAD (original state), e.g.If above won\'t help, it may be rules in your git normalization file (.gitattributes) so it\'s better to commit what it says. Or your file system doesn\'t support permissions, so you\'ve to disable filemode in your git config.Related: How do I force "git pull" to overwrite local files?So the situation that I ran into was the following:error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:\n  wp-content/w3tc-config/master.php\n  Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.except, right before that, was remote:\nso actually this:remote: error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:\n  some/file.ext\n  Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.What was happening was (I think, not 100% positive) the git post receive hook was starting to run and screwing up due to movement changes in the remote server repository, which in theory, shouldn\'t have been touched.So what I ended up doing by tracing through the post-receive hook and finding this, was having to go to the remote repository on the server, and there was the change (which wasn\'t on my local repository, which, in fact, said that it matched, no changes, nothing to commit, up to date, etc.) So while on the local, there were no changes, on the server, I then did a git checkout -- some/file.ext and then the local and remote repositories actually matched and I could continue to work, and deploy. Not entirely sure how this situation occurred, though a couple dozen developers plus IT changes may had something to do with it.
