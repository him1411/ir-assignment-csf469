Our (PHP) framework sometimes renders hidden inputs with value YTowOnt9. I can\'t find that string anywhere in the (huge) codebase, and can\'t figure out where it came from. I decided to Google for that particular string, and the result surprised me. Over half a million - kind of random - hits. I haven\'t found any page describing the value itself. It has 0 hits on StackÂ Overflow. Is YTowOnt9 some kind of magic string?It seems to be a PHP-serialized empty array, base 64 encoded.There are many scripts that serialize arrays of data. When the arrays have data, they vary greatly, so the Base64 encoded PHP-serialized values do too, but when they are empty they are all the same. It makes it look as if a lot of very different PHP scripts have this random string in common.
