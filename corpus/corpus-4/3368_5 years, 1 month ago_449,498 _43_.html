I have open the google play store using the follwing code But it shows me a Complete Action View as to select the option (browser/play store). I need to open the application in playstore directly.You can do this using the market:// prefix.We use a try/catch block here because an Exception will be thrown if the Play Store is not installed on the target device.NOTE: any app can register as capable of handling the market://details?id=<appId> Uri, if you want to specifically target Google Play check the Ber\xc5\xa5\xc3\xa1k answerMany answers here suggest to use Uri.parse("market://details?id=" + appPackageName)) to open Google Play, but I think it is insufficient in fact: Some third-party applications can use its own intent-filters with "market://" scheme defined, thus they can process supplied Uri instead of Google Play (I experienced this situation with e.g.SnapPea application). The question is "How to open the Google Play Store?", so I assume, that you do not want to open any other application. Please also note, that e.g. app rating is only relevant in GP Store app etc...To open Google Play AND ONLY Google Play I use this method:The point is that when more applications beside Google Play can open our intent, app-chooser dialog is skipped and GP app is started directly.UPDATE: \nSometimes it seems that it opens GP app only, without opening the app\'s profile. As TrevorWiley suggested in his comment, Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP could fix the problem. (I didn\'t test it myself yet...)See this answer for understanding what Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED does.Go on Android Developer official link as tutorial step by step see and got the code for your application package from play store if exists or play store apps not exists then open application from web browser.Android Developer official linkhttp://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/linking.htmlLinking to a Applicaiton PageFrom a web site: http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=<package_name>From an Android app: market://details?id=<package_name>Linking to a Product ListFrom a web site: http://play.google.com/store/search?q=pub:<publisher_name>From an Android app: market://search?q=pub:<publisher_name>Linking to a Search ResultFrom a web site: http://play.google.com/store/search?q=<search_query>&c=appsFrom an Android app: market://search?q=<seach_query>&c=appstry thisALL OF THE ABOVE ANSWERS OPEN GOOGLE PLAY IN A NEW VIEW OF THE SAME APP, IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO OPEN GOOGLE PLAY (or any other app)INDEPENDENTLY:The important part is that actually opens google play or any other app independently. (Most of what I have seen uses the approach of the other answers and it was not what i needed hopefully this helps somebody)Regards. You can check if the Google Play Store app is installed and, if this is the case, you can use the "market://" protocol.use market://You can do:get Reference here:You can also try the approach described in the accepted answer of this question:\nCannot determine whether Google play store is installed or not on Android deviceReady-to-use solution:Based on Eric\'s answer.If you want to open Google Play store from your app then use this command directy: market://details?gotohome=com.yourAppName, it will open your app\'s Google Play store pages.Show all apps by a specific publisher   Search for apps that using the Query on its title or description    Reference: https://tricklio.com/market-details-gotohome-1/While Eric\'s answer is correct and Ber\xc5\xa5\xc3\xa1k\'s code also works. I think this combines both more elegantly.By using setPackage, you force the device to use the Play Store. If there is no Play Store installed, the Exception will be caught.I have combined both Ber\xc5\xa5\xc3\xa1k and  Stefano Munarini answer to creating a hybrid solution which handles both Rate this App and Show More App scenario.Usage
