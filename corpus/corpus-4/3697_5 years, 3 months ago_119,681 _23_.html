I recently saw that the Git console in Windows is colored, e.g. Green for additions, red for deletions, etc. How do I color my Ubuntu Git console like that?To install it, I used the command: $ sudo apt-get install git-coreAs noted by @VonC, color.ui defaults to auto since git 1.8.4. Not a release too soon ;)From the Unix & Linux Stackexchange question How to colorize output of git? and the answer by @Evgeny:The color.ui is a meta configuration that includes all the various color.* configurations available with git commands. This is explained in-depth in git help config.So basically it\'s easier and more future proof than setting the different color.* settings separately.In-depth explanation from the git config documentation:color.ui: This variable determines the default value for variables such as color.diff and color.grep that control the use of color per command family. Its scope will expand as more commands learn configuration to set a default for the --color option. Set it to always if you want all output not intended for machine consumption to use color, to true or auto if you want such output to use color when written to the terminal, or to false or never if you prefer git commands not to use color unless enabled explicitly with some other configuration or the --color option.For example see http://www.arthurkoziel.com/2008/05/02/git-configuration/The interesting part isColorized output:Add to your .gitconfig file next code:Git automatically colors most of its output if you ask it to. You can get very specific about what you want colored and how; but to turn on all the default terminal coloring, set color.ui to true:In Ubuntu or any other platform (yes, Windows too!); starting git1.8.4, which was released 2013-08-23, you won\'t have to do anything:Many tutorials teach users to set "color.ui" to "auto" as the first thing after you set "user.name/email" to introduce yourselves to Git. Now the variable defaults to "auto".So you will see colors by default.In your ~/.gitconfig file, simply add this:It takes care of all your git commands.Another way is to edit the .gitconfig (create one if not exist), for instance:and then add:GIT uses colored output by default but on some system like as CentOS it is not enabled . You can enable it like this You can choose your required command from here . Here --global is optional to apply action for every repository in your system . If you want to apply coloring for current repository only then you can do something like this -
