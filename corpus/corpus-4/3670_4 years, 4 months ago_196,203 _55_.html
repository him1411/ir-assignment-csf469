What\'s the right way of removing CocoaPods from a project? I want to remove the whole CocoaPod. Due to some limitations imposed by my client I can\'t use it. I need to have just one xcodeproj instead of an xcworkspace.Removing CocoaPods from a project is possible, but not currently automated by the CLI. First thing, if the only issue you have is not being able to use an xcworkspace you can use CocoaPods with just xcodeprojs by using the --no-integrate flag which will produce the Pods.xcodeproj but not a workspace. Then you can add this xcodeproj as a subproject to your main xcodeproj.If you really want to remove all CocoaPods integration you need to do a few things:NOTE editing some of these things if done incorrectly could break your main project. I strongly encourage you to check your projects into source control just in case. Also these instructions are for CocoaPods version 0.39.0, they could change with new versions.After those steps you should be set with a single xcodeproj that existed before you integrated CocoaPods. If I missed anything let me know and I will edit this.Also we\'re always looking for suggestions for how to improve CocoaPods so if you have an issues please submit them in our issue tracker so we can come up with a way to fix them!EDITAs shown by Jack Wu in the comments there is a third party CocoaPods plugin that can automate these steps for you. It can be found here. Note that it is a third party plugin and might not always be updated when CocoaPods is. Also note that it is made by a CocoaPods core team member so that problem won\'t be a problem.pod deintegrate and pod clean are two designated commands to remove CocoaPod from your project/repo.Here is the complete set of commands:The original solution was found here: https://medium.com/@icanhazedit/remove-uninstall-deintegrate-cocoapods-from-your-xcode-ios-project-c4621cee5e42#.wd00fj2e5CocoaPod documentation on pod deintegrate: https://guides.cocoapods.org/terminal/commands.html#pod_deintegrateI think there\'s a more easy way to do that.As edited by the accepted answer, now you can use a third party plugin cocoapods-deintegrate, it\'s reliable because its made by a CocoaPods core team member. But,there\'re still some files remain:You could remove them from your project manually\xef\xbc\x8cbut there\'s also another tool for helping you to clean them, thanks cocoapods-clean.Finally, the uninstallation work is still not completed, cocoapods-clean don\'t clean the Podfile, just run:Cheers!Before removing you should ensure you have a backup of your project!To remove pods from a project completely you need to install two thing first...those are follows(Assuming you have already cocoa-pods installed in your system.)...Installation Process ...Cocoapods-Deintegrate PluginUse this following command on your terminal to install it.Cocoapods-Clean PluginUse this following command on your terminal to install it.Usage Procedure...First of all goto your project folder by using the as usual command like..Now use those two plugins two remove it completely as follows..Cocoapods-Deintegrate PluginUse this following command on your terminal to deintegrate the pods from your project first.Cocoapods-Clean PluginAfter deintegration of pod from your project use this following command on your terminal to clean it completely.After completing the above tasks there should be the Podfile still remain on your project directory..Just delete that manually or use this following command on the terminal..Thats it...Now you have your project free from pods..Cleaned.Removing Cocoapods from the systemAny way try to use the following command on your terminal to uninstall/remove the coca-pods from your system.It will remove the coca-pods automatically.Thanks.\nHope this helped.I tried all these answers but it still wouldn\'t build, eventually I tried:which actually worked!It\'s like it needs to remove all the pod scripts from your build phases and re-add them back in for it to work, at least in my case.\npod deintegrate\n\nAfter this cmd, no traces of Cocoapods left in your certain project.\nNote: your worksapce referenceing the Pods project still remains;\nyou should manually delete 3 files: xx.xcworkspace, Podifle and Podfile.lock.\nThen you can use you project agian.\nHave fun!\nTest CocoaPod version = 1.2.0Keith\'s answer is great - I just want to point out that because Cocoapods 0.36 is starting to support Dynamic Frameworks, if you are using \'use_frameworks!\' in your \'Podfile\' and you wish to remove the Cocoapods, you must do this:There can be two aspects developer may face.In first case you have to use \'pod deintegrate\' and follow several steps which are mentioned in the answers above.For second case that is if you want to uninstall any particular framework which is installed there very simple way available in your pod file just comment the framework which you want to uninstall and run pod install command.Here I want to uninstall facebook and parse frameworks (which were installed using pods) and not iCarousel that is why I have updated my pod file like above.Now if I run pod install it will keep iCarousel as it is in my project and will remove facebook and parse.The only thing you may want to do is include some of the libraries that you were using before. You can do this by simply draging whatever folders where in the pods folders into your project (I prefer to put them into my Supporting Files folder).It worked for me. If not work, try \n 1. clean the project.\n 2. deleted derived data.\nif you don\'t know how to delete derived data go hereHow to "Delete derived data" in Xcode6?I am gonna write what iv done very briefly (to delete any CocoaPods from my project)..To remove the framework reference from xcode:
