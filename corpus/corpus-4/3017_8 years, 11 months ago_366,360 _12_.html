How do I execute a command-line program from C# and get back the STD OUT results.  Specifically, I want to execute DIFF on two files that are programmatically selected and write the results to a text box.  Yes, I could figure this out for myself, but surely someone else has done something like it and I\'m lazy...Code is from MSDN.Here\'s a quick sample:There one other parameter I found useful, which I use to eliminate the process windowthis helps to hide the black console window from user completely, if that is what you desire.You will need to use ProcessStartInfo with RedirectStandardOutput enabled - then you can read the output stream. You might find it easier to use ">" to redirect the output to a file (via the OS), and then simply read the file.[edit: like what Ray did: +1]This may not be the best/easiest way, but may be an option:When you execute from your code, add " > output.txt" and then read in the output.txt file.You can launch any command line program using the Process class, and set the StandardOutput property of the Process instance with a stream reader you create (either based on a string or a memory location).  After the process completes, you can then do whatever diff you need to on that stream.There is a ProcessHelper Class in PublicDomain open source code which might interest you.This might be useful for someone if your attempting to query the local ARP cache on a PC/Server.
