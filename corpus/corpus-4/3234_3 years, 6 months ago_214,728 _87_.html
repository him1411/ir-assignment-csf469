I have an acute problem on my website.\nIn Google Chrome some customers are not able to proceed to my payment page.\nWhen trying to submit a form I get this error:This is from the JavaScript console.I read that the problem could be due to hidden fields having the required attribute.\nNow the problem is that we are using .net webforms required field validators, and not the html5 required attribute.It seems random who gets this error.\nIs there anyone who knows a solution for this?Adding a novalidate attribute to the form will help:It\'s not enough to stateAdding a novalidate attribute to the form will helpIt does not explain the problem, and the OP may not have understood why it would help, or if it really is helpful.Here\'s an answer that truly explains the case, understanding the problem should enable you to arrive at a solution that is suitable for your development:Chrome wants to focus on a control that is required but still empty so that it can pop up the message \'Please fill out this field\'. However, if the control is hidden at the point that Chrome wants to pop up the message, that is at the time of form submission, Chrome can\'t focus on the control because it is hidden, therefore the form won\'t submit.So, to get around the problem, when a control is hidden by javascript, we also must remove the \'required\' attribute from that control.To put the warning into good use, consider this - don\'t hide a field when it fails validation. But that is not a strict rule, nor is it a rule at all. As I mentioned in my comment below, I paraphraseIn some cases, the issue is not a problem at all and does not cause loss of functionality in an application. Then the error maybe ignored.The error in question may also arise due to a premature validation. Premature validation can occur when you have a <button> input without a set type attribute. Without the type attribute of a button being set to button, Chrome (or any other browser for that matter) performs a validation each time the button is clicked because submit is the default type of buttons. To solve the problem, if you have a button on your page that does something else other than submit or reset, always remember to do this: <button type="button">In your form, You might have hidden input having required attribute.Hence form can\'t focus on that element, you have to remove required from all hidden inputs. In case anyone else has this issue, I experienced the same thing. As discussed in the comments, it was due to the browser attempting to validate hidden fields. It was finding empty fields in the form and trying to focus on them, but because they were set to display:none;, it couldn\'t. Hence the error.I was able to solve it by using something similar to this:Also, this is possibly a duplicate of "Invalid form control" only in Google ChromeNone of the previous answers worked for me, and I don\'t have any hidden fields with the required attribute.In my case, the problem was caused by having a <form> and then a <fieldset> as its first child, which holds the <input> with the required attribute. Removing the <fieldset> solved the problem. Or you can wrap your form with it; it is allowed by HTML5.I\'m on Windows 7 x64, Chrome version 43.0.2357.130 m.For me this happens, when there\'s a <select> field with pre-selected option with value of \'\':Unfortunately it\'s the only cross-browser solution for a placeholder (How do I make a placeholder for a 'select' box?).The issue comes up on Chrome 43.0.2357.124. If you have any field with required attribute which is not visible during the form submission, this error will be thrown. You just remove the required attribute when your try to hide that field. You can add the required attribute in case if you want to show the field again. By this way, your validation will not be compromised and at the same time, the error will not be thrown. Yet another possibility if you\'re getting the error on a checkbox input. If your checkboxes use custom CSS which hides the default and replaces it with some other styling, this will also trigger the not focusable error in Chrome on validation error.I found this in my stylesheet:Simple fix was to replace it with this:For Select2 Jquery problem The problem is due to the HTML5 validation cannot focus a hidden invalid element. \nI came across this issue when I was dealing with jQuery Select2 plugin. Solution\nYou could inject an event listener on and \'invalid\' event of every element of a form so that you can manipulate just before the HTML5 validate event.In my case the problem was with the input type="radio" required being hidden with:visibility: hidden;This error message will also show if the required input type radio or checkbox has a display: none; CSS property. If you want to create custom radio/checkbox inputs where they must be hidden from the UI and still keep the required attribute, you should instead use the: opacity: 0; CSS propertyYea.. If a hidden form control has required field then it shows this error. One solution would be to disable this form control. This is because usually if you are hiding a form control it is because you are not concerned with its value. So this form control name value pair wont be sent  while submitting the form.It can be that you have hidden (display: none) fields with the required attribute.Please check all required fields are visible to the user :)Another possible cause and not covered in all previous answers when you have a normal form with required fields and you submit the form then hide it directly after submission (with javascript) giving no time for validation functionality to work.The validation functionality will try to focus on the required field and show the error validation message but the field has already been hidden, so "An invalid form control with name=\'\' is not focusable." appears!Edit:To handle this case simply add the following condition inside your submit handlerEdit: ExplanationSupposing you\'re hiding the form on submission, this code guarantees that the form/fields will not be hidden until form become valid. So, if a field is not valid, the browser can focus on it with no problems as this field is still displayed.For Angular use: ng-required="boolean" This will only apply the html5 \'required\' attribute if the value is true. It will show that message if you have code like this:You may try .removeAttribute("required") for those elements which are hidden at the time of window load. as it is quite probable that the element in question is marked hidden due to javascript (tabbed forms)e.g.This should do the task. It worked for me... cheers Alternatively another and foolproof answer is to use HTML5 Placeholder attribute then there will be no need to use any js validations. Chrome will not be able to find any empty, hidden and required elements to focus on. Simple Solution. Hope that helps. I am totally sorted with this solution. I came here with the same problem. For me (injecting hidden elements as needed - i.e. education in a job app) had the required flags.What I realized was that the validator was firing on the injected faster than the document was ready, thus it complained. My original ng-required tag was using the visibility tag (vm.flags.hasHighSchool). I resolved by creating a dedicated flag to set required\nng-required="vm.flags.highSchoolRequired == true"I added a 10ms callback on setting that flag and the problem was solved.Html:Make sure that all of the controls in your form with the required attribute also have the name attribute setThis error happened to me because I was submitting a form with required fields that were not filled.The error was produced because the browser was trying to focus on the required fields to warn the user the fields were required but those required fields were hidden in a display none div so the browser could not focus on them. I was submitting from a visible tab and the required fields were in an hidden tab, hence the error.To fix, make sure you control the required fields are filled.Its because there is a hidden input with required attribute in the form.In my case, I had a select box and it is hidden by jquery tokenizer using inline style. If I dont select any token, browser throws the above error on form submission.So, I fixed it using the below css technique :I received the same error when cloning an HTML element for use in a form.(I have a partially complete form, which has a template injected into it, and then the template is modified)The error was referencing the original field, and not the cloned version.I couldn\'t find any methods that would force the form to re-evaluate itself (in the hope it would get rid of any references to the old fields that now don\'t exist) before running the validation.In order to get around this issue, I removed the required attribute from the original element and dynamically added it to the cloned field before injecting it into the form. The form now validates the cloned and modified fields correctly.I came here to answer that I had triggered this issue myself based on NOT closing the </form> tag AND having multiple forms on the same page.  The first form will extend to include seeking validation on form inputs from elsewhere.  Because THOSE forms are hidden, they triggered the error.so for instance:Triggers An invalid form control with name=\'userId\' is not focusable.An invalid form control with name=\'password\' is not focusable.An invalid form control with name=\'confirm\' is not focusable.My scenario I hope not missed in this lengthy seed of answers was something really odd.I have div elements that dynamically update through a dialogBox being called in them to load and get actioned in.In short the div ids had I had a user:  \xe6\xb5\x8b\xe8\xaf\x95\xe5\xb8\x90\xe6\x88\xb7  and for some reason the encoding did some strange stuff in the java script world. I got this error message for a form working in other places.Narrowed it down to this and a retest of using numeric numbers instead i.e id appears to fix the issue.
