I know about camel case rules, but I\'m confused with this m rule. What does it stand for? I\'m a PHP developer. "We" use first letters of variables as indication of type, like \'b\' for boolean, \'i\' for integer and so on.Is \'m\' a Java thing? Does it stand for mobile? mixed?This notation comes from AOSP (Android Open Source Project) Code Style Guidelines for Contributors:Follow Field Naming ConventionsNote that the linked style guide is for code to be contributed to the Android Open Source Project.  It is not a style guide for the code of individual Android apps.A lot of coding guide lines use m for \'members\' of a class. So when you\'re programming you can see the difference between local and member variables.What is m prefix?m stands for member variable or data member. Use m prefix for non-public and non-static fields.When to Use?When not to Use?What I do?Personally, I don\'t use it. It makes the code more complicated and chaos the readability. If you are still using Notepad for coding I have no words, but modern IDEs are capable of highlighting and coloring member and local variables or anything else.ConclusionUse? "Yes" or "No" is your personal choice.If it\'s member variables in classes, the \'m\' means \'member\'. Many Java programmers do that, although with modern IDEs it\'s not needed since you have highlighting, mouse over tooltips, etc.According to Clean Code book, it\'s not a clean code.You don\'t need to prefix member variables with m. Besides, people quickly learn to ignore the prefix or suffix to see the meaningful part of the name.I think it is very individual which code conventions is used. I prefer to name my variables with the following prefixes:But I guess that each programmer has their own style.As was mentioned earlier, it is styled for different variable. But also it is very useful for code-generation. If you press "Alt + Insert" you will get windows for most common code generations properties. If you want to generate "get" method for your variable you will get.But if  you declare "m, s" you will get:It will be automatically generated and "m" or "s" deleted from your constructor, get, set methods name. \nAfter this "get"\' and "set" for the field will be generated without "m". Andoroid Fle->Setting->Code Style->\nJava->Code Genenretion.  And make as on a picture.\nMaybe it will help.\nSorry for my eng.\nConfigure androidIt seems to have been a personal preference of some early Android/Google engineers to start member variables with \'m\' and so they recommended it.Now this rule is being forced down the throats of developers in companies who are neither AOSP contributors, simply because that page is considered Android Code Style rules. There is little if any benefit in that rule. Google should consider removing it. Otherwise please specify that for Android Apps which of the Code Style Rules are optional.Please add your comment of support to this petition to remove the rule https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=226814As a mater of readability, should not be used anymore (m for member variables, s for static fields) if you are using a modern IDE (Android Studio). Android Studio can differentiate between those without adding m or s.It can also be stated that it stand for "mine", as in the Class/Instance is saying "This variable is mine and no one else can get to it." Different to static which, while it might be available to only the Class it is shared by all instances of that class. Like if you were drawing circles you\'d need to know how big the radius of each circle isbut at the same time you want a counter to keep track of all circles, inside of the circle class you could haveand then just have static members to increase and decrease the count of the circles you currently have. To prove that you definetely shouldn\'t treat this convention for naming variables in your code, I pass a screenshot from a parent Android Studio hereunder. Find that variables inside an object a specially sorted to put m-variables lower than your native variables. So by naming them in your code with "m" prefix you hide them in a heap from yourself.
