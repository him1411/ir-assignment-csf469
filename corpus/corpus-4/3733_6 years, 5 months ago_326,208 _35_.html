What are all the possible array init syntaxes that are possible with C#?It gets really confusing to know if it is an array initializer or a separate declaration.Note: I\'ve searched MSDN, googled it, but there isn\'t an all-in-one guide.I\'m using .NET 3.5 and C#.These are the current declaration and initialization methods for a simple array.Note that other techniques of obtaining arrays exist, such as the Linq ToArray() extensions on IEnumerable<T>.Also note that in the declarations above, the first two could replace the string[] on the left with var (C# 3+), as the information on the right is enough to infer the proper type. The third line must be written as displayed, as array initialization syntax alone is not enough to satisfy the compiler\'s demands. So if you\'re into the whole brevity thing, the above could be written asThe array creation syntaxes in C# that are expressions are:In the first one, the size may be any non-negative integral value and the array elements are initialized to the default values.In the second one, the size must be a constant and the number of elements given must match. There must be an implicit conversion from the given elements to the given array element type.In the third one, the elements must be implicitly convertible to the element type, and the size is determined from the number of elements given.In the fourth one the type of the array element is inferred by computing the best type, if there is one, of all the given elements that have types. All the elements must be implicitly convertible to that type. The size is determined from the number of elements given. This syntax was introduced in C# 3.0.There is also a syntax which may only be used in a declaration:The elements must be implicitly convertible to the element type. The size is determined from the number of elements given.there isn\'t an all-in-one guideI refer you to C# 4.0 specification, section 7.6.10.4 "Array Creation Expressions".var data0 = new int[3]var data1 = new int[3] { 1, 2, 3 }var data2 = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }var data3 = new[] { 1, 2, 3 } var data4 = { 1, 2, 3 } is not compilable. Use int[] data5 = { 1, 2, 3 } instead.var data8 = new [] { }  and int[] data9 = new [] { } are not compilable.var data10 = { } is not compilable. Use int[] data11 = { }  instead.         Only expressions that can be assigned with the var keyword can be passed as arguments.Will create array of empty strings repeated \'count\' times. In case you want to initialize array with same yet special default element value. Careful with reference types, all elements will refer same object.In case you want to initialize a fixed array of pre-initialized equal (non-null or other than default) elements, use this:Also please take part in this discussion.ororand in multi dimensional arrayRepeat without LINQ:Below is the class definition.This is how you can initialize the array:You can also create dynamic arrays i.e. you can first ask the size of the array from the user before creating it.Trivial solution with expressions. Note that with NewArrayInit you can create just one-dimensional array.
