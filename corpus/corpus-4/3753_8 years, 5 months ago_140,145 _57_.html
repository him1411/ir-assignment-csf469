I have a UITextView in my iOS Application, which displays a large amount of text. I am then paging this text by using the offset margin parameter of the UITextView. My problem is that the padding of the UITextView is confusing my calculations as it seems to be different depending on the font size and typeface that I use.Therefore, I pose the question: Is it possible to remove the padding surrounding the content of the UITextView?Look forward to hearing your responses!It is one of the most absurd bugs in iOS.UITextViewFixed is a usually a reasonable solution:Don\'t forget to turn off scrollEnabled in the Inspector!This works properly in storyboard, as you\'re working in Xcode.In general, that should be all you need in most cases, including even when you are changing the height of the text view on the fly, for example as the user types.Unusable UITextView from Apple...UITextViewFixed in almost all cases is an acceptable fix:(Yellow added for clarity.) Note that of course you mustDon\'t forget to turn off scrollEnabled!In some cases - perhaps particularly when using autolayout with flexible cell height table views, which change as you go - Apple does the most infuriating thing in the world,It would have to be one of the most infuriating things in iOS.Here is a "quick fix" for that madness.Notes:(1) Sometimes, to fix yet another subtle Apple mess-up, you have to add this:(2) Arguably, we should be adding :(do that just after textContainer.lineFragmentPadding = 0) However ... it doesn\'t work in current iOS! It may be necessary to add that in future OS versions.The fact that UITextView, of all things, is totally broken in iOS is just one of the weirdest things in all of mobile computing.Finally, here\'s a somewhat similar tip for TextField: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43099816/294884For iOS 7.0, I\'ve found that the contentInset trick no longer works. This is the code I used to get rid of the margin/padding in iOS 7.This brings the left edge of the text to the left edge of the container:This causes the top of the text to align with the top of the containerBoth Lines are needed to completely remove the margin/padding.This workaround was written in 2009 when IOS 3.0 was released. It no longer applies.I ran into the exact same problem, in the end I had to wind up usingwhere nameField is a UITextView.  The font I happened to be using was Helvetica 16 point.  Its only a custom solution for the particular field size I was drawing.  This makes the left offset flush with the left side, and the top offset where I want it for the box its draw in. In addition, this only seems to apply to UITextViews where you are using the default aligment, ie.Align to the right for example and the UIEdgeInsetsMake seems to have no impact on the right edge at all.At very least, using the .contentInset property allows you to place your fields with the "correct" positions, and accommodate the deviations without offsetting your UITextViews.On iOS 5 UIEdgeInsetsMake(-8,-8,-8,-8); seems to work great.Building off some of the good answers already given, here is a purely Interface Builder-based solution that makes use of User Defined Runtime Attributes and works in iOS 7.0+:I would definitely avoid any answers involving hard-coded values, as the actual margins may change with user font-size settings, etc.Here is @user1687195\'s answer, written without modifying the textContainer.lineFragmentPadding (because the docs state this is not the intended usage).This works great for iOS 7 and later.This is effectively the same outcome, just a bit cleaner in that it doesn\'t misuse the lineFragmentPadding property.All these answers address the title question, but I wanted to propose some solutions for the problems presented in the body of the OP\'s question.A quick way to calculate the size of the text inside the UITextView is to use the NSLayoutManager:This gives the total scrollable content, which may be bigger than the UITextView\'s frame. I found this to be much more accurate than textView.contentSize since it actually calculates how much space the text takes up. For example, given an empty UITextView:UIFont has a property that quickly allows you to get the line height for the given font. So you can quickly find the line height of the text in your UITextView with:Determining the amount of text that is actually visible is important for handling a "paging" effect. UITextView has a property called textContainerInset which actually is a margin between the actual UITextView.frame and the text itself. To calculate the real height of the visible frame you can perform the following calculations:Lastly, now that you have the visible text size and the content, you can quickly determine what your offsets should be by subtracting the textHeight from the textSize:Using all of these methods, I didn\'t touch my insets and I was able to go to the caret or wherever in the text that I want.Storyboard or Interface Builder solution, using User defined runtime attributes.\nUpdate. Added iOS7.1&iOS6.1 screenshots with contentInset = {{-10, -5}, {0, 0}}\n\nyou can use textContainerInset property of UITextView:textView.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 10, 10, 10);(top, left, bottom, right)For iOS 10, the following line works for the top and bottom padding removing.Note that change it to UIEdgeInset.zero on right hand side does not workDoing the inset solution I still had padding on the right side and the bottom. Also text alignment was causing issues. The only sure fire way I found was to put the text view inside another view that is clipped to bounds. I have found one more approach, getting view with text from UITextView\'s subviews and setting it up in layoutSubview method of a subclass:The textView scrolling also affect the position of the text and make it look like not vertically centered. I managed to center the text in the view by disabling the scrolling and setting the top inset to 0:For some reason I haven\'t figured it out yet, the cursor is still not centered before the typing begins, but the text centers immediately as I start typing.
