How can I determine the list of files in a directory from inside my C or C++ code?I\'m not allowed to execute the \'ls\' command and parse the results from within my program.In small and simple tasks I do not use boost, I use dirent.h which is also available for windows:It is just a small header file and does most of the simple stuff you need without using a big template-based approach like boost(no offence, I like boost!).\nI googled and found some links here\nThe author of the windows compatibility layer is Toni Ronkko. In Unix it is a standard-header.UPDATE 2017:In C++17 there is now an official way to list files of your file system: std::filesystem. There is an excellent answer from Shreevardhan below with this source code:Consider upvoting his answer, if you are using the C++17 approach.Unfortunately the C++ standard does not define a standard way of working with files and folders in this way. Since there is no cross platform way, the best cross platform way is to use a library such as the boost filesystem module.Cross platform boost method:The following function, given a directory path and a file name, recursively searches the directory and its sub-directories for the file name, returning a bool, and if successful, the path to the file that was found. Source from the boost page mentioned above.For Unix/Linux based systems: You can use opendir / readdir / closedir. Sample code which searches a directory for entry ``name\'\' is:Source code from the above man pages.For a windows based systems: you can use the Win32 API FindFirstFile / FindNextFile / FindClose functions.The following C++ example shows you a minimal use of FindFirstFile.Source code from the above msdn pages.C++17 now has a std::filesystem::directory_iterator, which can be used asAlso, std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator can iterate the subdirectories as well.One function is enough, you don\'t need to use any 3rd-party library (for Windows).PS: as mentioned by @Sebastian, you could change *.* to *.ext in order to  get only the EXT-files (i.e. of a specific type) in that directory.For a C only solution, please check this out. It only requires an extra header:https://github.com/cxong/tinydirSome advantages over other options:I recommend using glob with this reusable wrapper. It generates a vector<string> corresponding to file paths that fit the glob pattern:Which can then be called with a normal system wildcard pattern such as:Here is a very simple code in C++11 using boost::filesystem library to get file names in a directory (excluding folder names):Output is like:Why not use glob()?I think, below snippet can be used to list all the files.Following is the structure of the struct direntTry boost for x-platform methodhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htmor just use your OS specific file stuff.Check out this class which uses the win32 api. Just construct an instance by providing the foldername from which you want the listing then call the getNextFile method to get the next filename from the directory. I think it needs windows.h and stdio.h.GNU Manual FTWhttp://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Simple-Directory-Lister.html#Simple-Directory-ListerAlso, sometimes it\'s good to go right to the source (pun intended). You can learn a lot by looking at the innards of some of the most common commands in Linux. I\'ve set up a simple mirror of GNU\'s coreutils on github (for reading).https://github.com/homer6/gnu_coreutils/blob/master/src/ls.cMaybe this doesn\'t address Windows, but a number of cases of using Unix variants can be had by using these methods.Hope that helps...System call it!Then just read the file.EDIT: This answer should be considered a hack, but it really does work (albeit in a platform specific way) if you don\'t have access to more elegant solutions.I hope this code help you.This implementation realizes your purpose, dynamically filling an array of strings with the content of the specified directory.This works for me. I\'m sorry if I cannot remember the source. It is probably from a man page.This worked for me. It writes a file with just the names (no path) of all the files. Then it reads that txt file and prints it for you.
