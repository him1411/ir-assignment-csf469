I need to convert a certain JSON string to a Java object. I am using Jackson for JSON handling. I have no control over the input JSON (I read from a web service). This is my input JSON:Here is a simplified use case:My entity class is:My Wrapper class is basically a container object to get my list of students:I keep getting this error and "wrapper" returns null. I am not sure what\'s missing. Can someone help please?You can use Jackson\'s class-level annotation:It will ignore every property you haven\'t defined in your POJO. Very useful when you are just looking for a couple of properties in the JSON and don\'t want to write the whole mapping. More info at Jackson\'s website. If you want to ignore any non declared property, you should write:You can useIt will ignore all the properties that are not declared.The first answer is almost correct, but what is needed is to change getter method, NOT field -- field is private (and not auto-detected); further, getters have precedence over fields if both are visible.\n(there are ways to make private fields visible, too, but if you want to have getter there\'s not much point)So getter should either be named "getWrapper()", or annotated with:if you prefer getter method name as is.This just perfectly worked for me   @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true) annotation did not.This works better than All please refer to this property.using Jackson 2.6.0, this worked for me:and with setting:If you are using Jackson 2.0 it can be achieved 2 ways:Mark the POJO to ignore unknown propertiesConfigure ObjectMapper that serializes/De-serializes the POJO/json as below:It worked for me with the following code:According to the doc you can ignore selected fields or all uknown fields:Jackson is complaining because it can\'t find a field in your class Wrapper that\'s called "wrapper".  It\'s doing this because your JSON object has a property called "wrapper".I think the fix is to rename your Wrapper class\'s field to "wrapper" instead of "students".I have tried the below method and it works for such JSON format reading with Jackson.\nUse the already suggested solution of: annotating getter with @JsonProperty("wrapper")Your wrapper classMy Suggestion of wrapper classThis would however give you the output of the format:Also for more information refer to https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations Hope this helpsThis solution is generic when reading json streams and need to get only some fields while fields not mapped correctly in your Domain Classes can be ignored:A detailed solution would be to use a tool such as   jsonschema2pojo to autogenerate the required Domain Classes such as Student from the Schema of the json Response. You can do the latter by any online json to schema converter.As no one else has mentioned, thought I would...Problem is your property in your JSON is called "wrapper" and your property in Wrapper.class is called "students".So either...Annotate the field students as below since there is mismatch in names of json property and java propertyYour input indicates that it is an Object, with a field named "wrapper", which is a Collection of Students. So my recommendation would be,where Wrapper is defined asFor my part, the only line @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)didn\'t work too.Just add Jackson 2.4.0This worked perfectly for me What worked for me, was to make the property public. It solved the problem for me.Either Change to ---- or ----Change your JSON string to I fixed this problem by simply changing the signatures of my setter and getter methods of my POJO class. All I had to do was change the getObject method to match what the mapper was looking for. In my case I had a getImageUrl originally, but the JSON data had image_url which was throwing the mapper off. I changed both my setter and getters to getImage_url and setImage_url.Hope this helps.The POJO should be defined asResponse classWrapper classand mapper to read valueThe new Firebase Android introduced some huge changes ; below the copy of the doc :[https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/firebase-android] : Update your Java model objectsAs with the 2.x SDK, Firebase Database will automatically convert Java objects that you pass to DatabaseReference.setValue() into JSON and can read JSON into Java objects using DataSnapshot.getValue().In the new SDK, when reading JSON into a Java object with DataSnapshot.getValue(), unknown properties in the JSON are now ignored by default so you no longer need @JsonIgnoreExtraProperties(ignoreUnknown=true).To exclude fields/getters when writing a Java object to JSON, the annotation is now called @Exclude instead of @JsonIgnore.}If there is an extra property in your JSON that is not in your Java class, you will see this warning in the log files:You can get rid of this warning by putting an @IgnoreExtraProperties annotation on your class. If you want Firebase Database to behave as it did in the 2.x SDK and throw an exception if there are unknown properties, you can put a @ThrowOnExtraProperties annotation on your class.This may be a very late response, but just changing the POJO to this should solve the json string provided in the problem (since, the input string is not in your control as you said):You should just change the field of List from "students" to "wrapper" just the json file and the mapper will look it up.In my case it was simple: the REST-service JSON Object was updated (a property was added), but the REST-client JSON Object wasn\'t. As soon as i\'ve updated JSON client object the \'Unrecognized field ...\' exception has vanished.Your json string is not inline with the mapped class.\nChange the input stringOr change your mapped classYou need to verify all fields of the class you are parsing in, make it the same as in your original JSONObject. It helped me and in my case.@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true) didn\'t help at all. I was created public field, worked for me. In your case like below :}
