What is the difference between getContext() , getApplicationContext() , getBaseContext() , and "this"? Though this is simple question I am unable to understand the basic difference between them. Please give some easy examples if possible.View.getContext():  Returns the context the view is currently running in.  Usually the currently active Activity.Activity.getApplicationContext():  Returns the context for the entire application (the process all the Activities are running inside\nof).  Use this instead of the current Activity context if you need a\ncontext tied to the lifecycle of the entire application, not just the\ncurrent Activity.ContextWrapper.getBaseContext():  If you need access to a Context from within another context, you use a ContextWrapper.  The\nContext referred to from inside that ContextWrapper is accessed via\ngetBaseContext().getApplicationContext() - Returns the context for all activities running in application. getBaseContext() -  If you want to access Context from another context within application you can access.getContext() - Returns the context view only current running activity.Context provides information about the Actvity or Application to newly created components.Relevant Context should be provided to newly created components (whether application context or activity context)Since Activity is a subclass of Context, one can use this to get that activity\'s contextMost answers already cover getContext() and getApplicationContext() but getBaseContext() is rarely explained.The method getBaseContext() is only relevant when you have a ContextWrapper.\nAndroid provides a ContextWrapper class that is created around an existing Context using:The benefit of using a ContextWrapper is that it lets you \xe2\x80\x9cmodify behavior without changing the original Context\xe2\x80\x9d. For example, if you have an activity called myActivity then can create a View with a different theme than myActivity:ContextWrapper is really powerful because it lets you override most functions provided by Context including code to access resources (e.g. openFileInput(), getString()), interact with other components (e.g. sendBroadcast(), registerReceiver()), requests permissions (e.g. checkCallingOrSelfPermission()) and resolving file system locations (e.g. getFilesDir()). ContextWrapper is really useful to work around device/version specific problems or to apply one-off customizations to components such as Views that require a context.The method getBaseContext() can be used to access the \xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d Context that the ContextWrapper wraps around. You might need to access the \xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d context if you need to, for example, check whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a Service, Activity or Application:Or if you need to call the \xe2\x80\x9cunwrapped\xe2\x80\x9d version of a method:The question "what the Context is" is one of the most difficult questions in Android universe.Context defines methods that access system resources, retrieve application\'s static assets, check permissions, perform UI manipulations and many more. In essence, Context is an example of God Object anti-pattern in production.When it comes to which kind of Context should we use, it becomes very complicated because except for being God Object, the hierarchy tree of Context subclasses violates Liskov Substitution Principle brutally.This blog post attempts to summarize Context classes applicability in different situations.Let me copy the main table from that post for completeness:From this docsI understood that you should use:Try using the context-application instead of a context-activitygetApplicationContext() this is used for application level and refer to all activities.getContext() and getBaseContext() is most probably same .these are reffered only current activity which is live.thisis  refer current class object always.
