I\'d like to show the current language that the device UI is using. What code would I use? I want this as an NSString in fully spelled out format. (Not @"en_US")EDIT: For those driving on by, there are a ton of useful comments here, as the answer has evolved with new iOS releases.The solutions provided will actually return the current region of the device - not the currently selected language. These are often one and the same. However, if I am in North America and I set my language to Japanese, my region will still be English (United States). In order to retrieve the currently selected language, you can do:This will return a two letter code for the currently selected language. "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, "de" for German, etc. For more examples, please see this Wikipedia entry (in particular, the 639-1 column):List of ISO 639-1 codesThen it\'s a simple matter of converting the two letter codes to the string you would like to display. So if it\'s "en", display "English".Hope this helps someone that\'s looking to differentiate between region and currently selected language.EDITWorth to quote the header information from NSLocale.h:People interested in app language take a look at @mindvision\'s answerThe selected answer returns the current device language, but not the actual language used in the app. If you don\'t provide a localization in your app for the user\'s preferred language, the first localization available, ordered by the user\'s preferred order, is used.To discover the current language selected within your localizations useExample:Swift:This will probably give you what you want:It will show the name of the language, in the language itself.\nFor example:Solution for iOS 9:language = "en-US"languageDic will have the needed componentscountryCode = "US"languageCode = "en" The accepted, and the other answers all don\'t take into account that the preferred language can be another language than the device language.The device language is the language in which operating system elements and Apple apps are presented.The preferred language is the language the user would like to have apps localized in. Apple only provides a limited set of translations. If the preferred language is one language Apple translated their apps to, it will also be the device language. However if the user prefers a language for which Apple doesn\'t provide translations the device and preferred languages won\'t match. The device language will not be on first position in the preferred languages list.The following function will go through the preferred languages list and check if there is a translation in the Apple frameworks. The first language to have a translation is the device language. The function will return its language code.This works if the preferred language list is:The preferred language list can be edited in: Settings.app -> General -> Language & Region -> Preferred Language OrderYou can than use the device language code and translate it into the language name. The following lines will print the device language in the device language. For example "Espa\xc3\xb1ol" if the device is set to spanish.i use thisignore memory leak..and result isTranslating language codes such as en_US into English (United States) is a built in feature of NSLocale and NSLocale does not care where you get the language codes from. So there really is no reason to implement your own translation as the accepted answer suggests.Prints: English, German, SwedishYou can use the displayNameForKey:value: method of NSLocale:This will print out:If you specify the same locale identifier for the initWithLocaleIdentifier: and also the displayNameForKey:value: method, then it will give you the native name of the language. I\'ve discovered that if you remove the country code and use just fr and en, that it will also omit the country from the display name (on Mac OS X at least, not sure about iOS).Even there\'s a better way to get current device language. Let us try it by below code -Suggested by Abizern on hereFor getting user device current language use the following it code it worked for me.I tried to found out the right solution for myself. When I use Locale.preferredLanguages.first was returned the preferred language from your app settings. If you want get to know language from user device settings, you should the use string below:Swift 3To unwrap and use look at the line below:I\'m using this code:For MonoTouch C# developers use:Note: I know this was an iOS question, but as I am a MonoTouch developer, the answer on this page led me in the right direction and I thought I\'d share the results.To get current language of deviceTo get application languageNote:It fetches the language that you have given in CFBundleDevelopmentRegion of info.plistif CFBundleAllowMixedLocalizations is true in info.plist then first item of CFBundleLocalizations in info.plist is returnedIn Swift:Swift 3If you want to get only language here is my suggested answer:In my case i just wanted only Locale language not locale region. Output:\nIf your Locale language is Japanese and locale region is Japan then:langplusreg = ja-JPlangonly = jaFor Swift 3:NSLocale.preferredLanguages[0] as StringSimple Swift 3 function:According to Apple documentation Two letters format. Apple uses the ISO standard ISO-3166.@amir response in Swift :As of iOS 9, if you just want the language code without country code, you\'ll want this sort of helper function - since the language will contain the country code.Obviously, the solutions relying, for example, on usually work fine and return the current device language.But it could be misleading in some cases :If the app in which you want to get this value has already changed the language, for example with this kind of code :In this case, [NSLocale preferredLanguages] actually returns the preferred language set (and used) in this particular app, not the current device language !And... in this case the only way to properly get the actual current device language (and not that previously set in the app), is to firstly clear the key @"appleLanguages" in NSUserDefaults, like this :Then, [NSLocale preferredLanguages] now returns the correct value. Hope this help.
