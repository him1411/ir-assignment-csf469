I\'ve set up my controllers using data-ng-controller="xyzController as vm"I have a scenario with parent / child nested controllers. I have no problem accessing parent properties in the nested html by using $parent.vm.property, but I cannot figure out how to access the parent property from within my child controller.I\'ve tried injecting $scope and then using $scope.$parent.vm.property, but this isn\'t working?Can anyone offer advice?If your HTML is like below you could do something like this:Then you can access the parent scope as followsIf you want to access a parent controller from your view you have to do something like this:See jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/2r728/UpdateActually since you defined cities in the parent controller your child controller will inherit all scope variables. So theoritically you don\'t have to call $parent. The above example can also be written as follows:The AngularJS docs use this approach, here you can read more about the $scope.Another updateI think this is a better answer to the original poster. HTMLJSIf you use the controller as method you can also access the parent scope as followsAs you can see there are many different ways in accessing $scopes.Updated fiddle\nI\'ve just checkedworks for me.and it will be for the view.When you are using as syntax, like  ParentController as parentCtrl, to define a controller then to access parent scope variable in child controller use following :Where parentCtrl is name of parent controller using as syntax and id is a variable defined in same controller.Some times you may need to update parent properties directly within child scope. e.g. need to save a date and time of parent control after changes by a child controller. e.g Code in JSFiddleHTMLJSYou can also circumvent scope inheritance and store things in the "global" scope.If you have a main controller in your application which wraps all other controllers, you can install a "hook" to the global scope:Then in any child controller, you can access the "global" scope with $scope.root. Anything you set here will be globally visible.Example:I believe I had a similar quandary recentlyMy setup was a little different, but the same thing should probably still workPerhaps this is lame but you can also just point them both at some external object:The benefit here is that edits in ChildCtrl now propogate back to the data in the parent.
