Why does the following behave unexpectedly in Python?I am using Python 2.5.2. Trying some different versions of Python, it appears that Python 2.3.3 shows the above behaviour between 99 and 100.Based on the above, I can hypothesize that Python is internally implemented such that "small" integers are stored in a different way than larger integers and the is operator can tell the difference. Why the leaky abstraction? What is a better way of comparing two arbitrary objects to see whether they are the same when I don\'t know in advance whether they are numbers or not?Take a look at this:EDIT: Here\'s what I found in the Python 2 documentation, "Plain Integer Objects" (It\'s the same for Python 3):The current implementation keeps an\n  array of integer objects for all\n  integers between -5 and 256, when you\n  create an int in that range you\n  actually just get back a reference to\n  the existing object. So it should be\n  possible to change the value of 1. I\n  suspect the behaviour of Python in\n  this case is undefined. :-)It depends on whether you\'re looking to see if 2 things are equal, or the same object. is checks to see if they are the same object, not just equal. The small ints are probably pointing to the same memory location for space efficiency You should use == to compare equality of arbitrary objects. You can specify the behavior with the __eq__, and __ne__ attributes.In summary - let me emphasize: Do not use is to compare integers.This isn\'t behavior you should have any expectations about.Instead, use == and != to compare for equality and inequality, respectively. For example:To know this, you need to know the following.First, what does is do? It is a comparison operator. From the documentation:The operators is and is not test for object identity: x is y is true\n  if and only if x and y are the same object. x is not y yields the\n  inverse truth value.And so the following are equivalent. From the documentation:id\n  Return the \xe2\x80\x9cidentity\xe2\x80\x9d of an object. This is an integer (or long\n  integer) which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object\n  during its lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may\n  have the same id() value.Note that the fact that the id of an object in CPython (the reference implementation of Python) is the location in memory is an implementation detail. Other implementations of Python (such as Jython or IronPython) could easily have a different implementation for id.So what is the use-case for is?  PEP8 describes:Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with is or\n  is not, never the equality operators.You ask, and state, the following question (with code):Why does the following behave unexpectedly in Python?It is not an expected result. Why is it expected? It only means that the integers valued at 256 referenced by both a and b are the same instance of integer. Integers are immutable in Python, thus they cannot change. This should have no impact on any code. It should not be expected. It is merely an implementation detail. But perhaps we should be glad that there is not a new separate instance in memory every time we state a value equals 256. Looks like we now have two separate instances of integers with the value of 257 in memory. Since integers are immutable, this wastes memory. Let\'s hope we\'re not wasting a lot of it. We\'re probably not. But this behavior is not guaranteed.Well, this looks like your particular implementation of Python is trying to be smart and not creating redundantly valued integers in memory unless it has to. You seem to indicate you are using the referent implementation of Python, which is CPython. Good for CPython. It might be even better if CPython could do this globally, if it could do so cheaply (as there would a cost in the lookup), perhaps another implementation might. But as for impact on code, you should not care if an integer is a particular instance of an integer. You should only care what the value of that instance is, and you would use the normal comparison operators for that, i.e. ==.is checks that the id of two objects are the same. In CPython, the id is the location in memory, but it could be some other uniquely identifying number in another implementation. To restate this with code:is the same asThis can be a very fast check relative to say, checking if two very long strings are equal in value. But since it applies to the uniqueness of the object, we thus have limited use-cases for it. In fact, we mostly want to use it to check for None, which is a singleton (a sole instance existing in one place in memory). We might create other singletons if there is potential to conflate them, which we might check with is, but these are relatively rare. Here\'s an example (will work in Python 2 and 3) e.g.Which prints:And so we see, with is and a sentinel, we are able to differentiate between when bar is called with no arguments and when it is called with None. These are the primary use-cases for is - do not use it to test for equality of integers, strings, tuples, or other things like these.As you can check in source file intobject.c, Python caches small integers for efficiency. Every time you create a reference to a small integer, you are referring the cached small integer, not a new object. 257 is not an small integer, so it is calculated as a different object.It is better to use == for that purpose.I\'m late but, you want some source with your answer?*Good thing about CPython is that you can actually see the source for this. I\'m going to use links for the 3.5 release for now; finding the corresponding 2.x ones is trivial.In CPython, the C-API function that handles creating a new int object is PyLong_FromLong(long v). The description for this function is:The current implementation keeps an array of integer objects for all integers between -5 and 256, when you create an int in that range you actually just get back a reference to the existing object. So it should be possible to change the value of 1. I suspect the behaviour of Python in this case is undefined. :-)Don\'t know about you but I see this and think: Let\'s find that array!If you haven\'t fiddled with the C code implementing CPython you should, everything is pretty organized and readable. For our case, we need to look in the Objects/ subdirectory of the main source code directory tree.PyLong_FromLong deals with long objects so it shouldn\'t be hard to deduce that we need to peek inside longobject.c. After looking inside you might think things are chaotic; they are, but fear not, the function we\'re looking for is chilling at line 230 waiting for us to check it out. It\'s a smallish function so the main body (excluding declarations) is easily pasted here:Now, we\'re no C master-code-haxxorz but we\'re also not dumb, we can see that CHECK_SMALL_INT(ival); peeking at us all seductively; we can understand it has something to do with this. Let\'s check it out:So it\'s a macro that calls function get_small_int if the value ival satisfies the condition:So what are NSMALLNEGINTS and NSMALLPOSINTS? If you guessed macros you get nothing because that wasn\'t such a hard question.. Anyway, here they are:So our condition is if (-5 <= ival && ival < 257) call get_small_int. No other place to go but continue our journey by looking at get_small_int in all its glory (well, we\'ll just look at it\'s body because that\'s were the interesting things are):Okay, declare a PyObject, assert that the previous condition holds and execute the assignment:small_ints looks a lot like that array we\'ve been searching for.. and, it is! We could\'ve just read the damn documentation and we would\'ve know all along!:So yup, this is our guy. When you want to create a new int in the range [NSMALLNEGINTS, NSMALLPOSINTS) you\'ll just get back a reference to an already existing object that has been preallocated. Since the reference refers to the same object, issuing id() directly or checking for identity with is on it will return exactly the same thing. During initialization in _PyLong_Init Python will gladly enter in a for loop do do this for you: I hope my explanation has made you C (pun obviously intented) things clearly now.This is actually easier to explain, and I have attempted to do so already; it\'s due to the fact that Python will execute this interactive statement:as a single block. During complilation of this statement, CPython will see that you have two matching literals and will use the same PyLongObject representing 257. You can see this if you do the compilation yourself and examine its contents:When CPython does the operation; it\'s now just going to load the exact same object:So is will return True.* -- I\'ll try and word this in a more introductory manner in order for most to be able to follow along.I think your hypotheses is correct. Experiment with id (identity of object):It appears that numbers <= 255 are treated as literals and anything above is treated differently!For immutable value objects, like ints, strings or datetimes, object identity is not especially useful. It\'s better to think about equality. Identity is essentially an implementation detail for value objects - since they\'re immutable, there\'s no effective difference between having multiple refs to the same object or multiple objects.is is the identity equality operator (functioning like id(a) == id(b)); it\'s just that two equal numbers aren\'t necessarily the same object. For performance reasons some small integers happen to be memoized so they will tend to be the same (this can be done since they are immutable).PHP\'s === operator, on the other hand, is described as checking equality and type: x == y and type(x) == type(y) as per Paulo Freitas\' comment. This will suffice for common numbers, but differ from is for classes that define __eq__ in an absurd manner:PHP apparently allows the same thing for "built-in" classes (which I take to mean implemented at C level, not in PHP). A slightly less absurd use might be a timer object, which has a different value every time it\'s used as a number. Quite why you\'d want to emulate Visual Basic\'s Now instead of showing that it is an evaluation with time.time() I don\'t know.Greg Hewgill (OP) made one clarifying comment "My goal is to compare object identity, rather than equality of value. Except for numbers, where I want to treat object identity the same as equality of value."This would have yet another answer, as we have to categorize things as numbers or not, to select whether we compare with == or is. CPython defines the number protocol, including PyNumber_Check, but this is not accessible from Python itself.We could try to use isinstance with all the number types we know of, but this would inevitably be incomplete. The types module contains a StringTypes list but no NumberTypes. Since Python 2.6, the built in number classes have a base class numbers.Number, but it has the same problem:By the way, NumPy will produce separate instances of low numbers.I don\'t actually know an answer to this variant of the question. I suppose one could theoretically use ctypes to call PyNumber_Check, but even that function has been debated, and it\'s certainly not portable. We\'ll just have to be less particular about what we test for now.In the end, this issue stems from Python not originally having a type tree with predicates like Scheme\'s number?, or Haskell\'s type class Num. is checks object identity, not value equality. PHP has a colorful history as well, where === apparently behaves as is only on objects in PHP5, but not PHP4. Such are the growing pains of moving across languages (including versions of one).It also happens with strings:Now everything seems fine.That\'s expected too.Now that\'s unexpected.Take a look hereThe current implementation keeps an array of integer objects for all\n  integers between -5 and 256, when you create an int in that range you\n  actually just get back a reference to the existing object.
