I see there are a few. Which ones are maintained and easy to use? What are their pros and cons? It turns out, the russian developer Ilya Konyukhov picked up the gauntlet after reading this and created a new auth library for CI based on DX Auth, following the recommendations and requirements below.And the resulting Tank Auth is looking like the answer to the OP\'s question. I\'m going to go out on a limb here and call Tank Auth the best authentication library for CodeIgniter available today. It\'s a rock-solid library that has all the features you need and none of the bloat you don\'t:Pros(Minor) ConsDownload Tank Auth hereOriginal answer:I\'ve implemented my own as well (currently about 80% done after a few weeks of work). I tried all of the others first; FreakAuth Light, DX Auth, Redux, SimpleLogin, SimpleLoginSecure, pc_user, Fresh Powered, and a few more. None of them were up to par, IMO, either they were lacking basic features, inherently INsecure, or too bloated for my taste.Actually, I did a detailed roundup of all the authentication libraries for CodeIgniter when I was testing them out (just after New Year\'s). FWIW, I\'ll share it with you:ProsConsProsConsProsConsProsConsAccording to the CodeIgniter wiki, Redux has been discontinued, but the Ion Auth fork is going strong: https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-AuthIon Auth is a well featured library without it being overly heavy or under advanced. In most cases its feature set will more than cater for a project\'s requirements.ProsConsProsConsDon\'t get me wrong: I don\'t mean to disrespect any of the above libraries; I am very impressed with what their developers have accomplished and how far each of them have come, and I\'m not above reusing some of their code to build my own. What I\'m saying is, sometimes in these projects, the focus shifts from the essential \'need-to-haves\' (such as hard security practices) over to softer \'nice-to-haves\', and that\'s what I hope to remedy.Therefore: back to basics.Here\'s my MINIMAL required list of features from an authentication library. It also happens to be a subset of my own library\'s feature list ;)Note: those last few points are not super-high-security overkill that you don\'t need for your web application. If an authentication library doesn\'t meet these security standards 100%, DO NOT USE IT!Recent high-profile examples of irresponsible coders who left them out of their software: #17 is how Sarah Palin\'s AOL email was hacked during the Presidential campaign; a nasty combination of #18 and #19 were the culprit recently when the Twitter accounts of Britney Spears, Barack Obama, Fox News and others were hacked; and #20 alone is how Chinese hackers managed to steal 9 million items of personal information from more than 70.000 Korean web sites in one automated hack in 2008.These attacks are not brain surgery. If you leave your back doors wide open, you shouldn\'t delude yourself into a false sense of security by bolting the front. Moreover, if you\'re serious enough about coding to choose a best-practices framework like CodeIgniter, you owe it to yourself to at least get the most basic security measures done right.<rant>Basically, here\'s how it is: I don\'t care if an auth library offers a bunch of features, advanced role management, PHP4 compatibility, pretty CAPTCHA fonts, country tables, complete admin panels, bells and whistles -- if the library actually makes my site less secure by not following best practices. It\'s an authentication package; it needs to do ONE thing right: Authentication. If it fails to do that, it\'s actually doing more harm than good.</rant>/Jens RolandNote that the "comprehensive listing" by Jens Roland doesn\'t include user roles.  If you\'re interested in assigning different user roles (like admin/user or admin/editor/user), these libraries allow it:Tank_Auth (#1 above in Jens\'s list) doesn\'t have user roles.  I realize it\'s not exactly part of authentication, but since It makes a LOT of sense to have one library to handle both, if you need it.  I\'m switching to Ion_Auth from Tank_Auth because of this.Ion_auth! Looks very promising and small footprint! I like..http://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-AuthI\'m the developer of Redux Auth and some of the issues you mentioned have been fixed in the version 2 beta. You can download this off the offcial website with a sample application too.Security questions are now not used and a simpler forgotten password system has been put in place.This was fixed in version 2 and returns boolean values. I hated the hodgepodge as much as you.The sample application uses the CI\'s validation system.Work in progressI also implemented some other features such as email views, this gives you the choice of being able to use the CodeIgniter helpers in your emails.It\'s still a work in progress so if have any more suggestions please keep them coming.-PopcornPs : Thanks for recommending Redux.Maybe you\'d find Redux suiting your needs. It\'s no overkill and comes packed solely with bare features most of us would require. The dev and contributors were very strict on what code was contributed.This is the official pageI\'ve come across Flexi Auth (http://haseydesign.com/flexi-auth/). It looks very promising, and I\'ve started using it. It has wonderfful features. Fully integrates with CI, and comes with two different library files, in which one is very heavy loaded with all the functions and the other one contains only the validations. One of the best is that the newly registered member gets temporary access for a given amount of time on the site, until they click on the link from their email and activate.Ion_Auth beats tank_auth mainly for two reasons, user roles and documentation, these two are missing from tank_auth.I use a customized version of DX Auth. I found it simple to use, extremely easy to modify and it has a user guide (with great examples) that is very similar to Code Igniter\'s.Also take a look at BackendProUltimately you will probably end up writing something custom, but there\'s nothing wrong with borrowing concepts from DX Auth, Freak Auth, BackendPro, etc.My experiences with the packaged apps is they are specific to certain structures and I have had problems integrating them into my own applications without requiring hacks, then if the pre-package has an update, I have to migrate them in.I also use Smarty and ADOdb in my CI code, so no matter what I would always end up making major code changes.Tank Auth looks good but the documentation is just a one-page explanation of how to install, plus a quick run-down of each PHP file. At least that\'s all I found after lots of Googling. Maybe what people mean above when they say that Tank Auth is well-documented is that the code is well-commented. That\'s a good thing, but different than documentation. It would have been nice to have some documentation about how to integrate Tank Auth\'s features with your existing code.I\'m trying Ion_Auth and appreciate it, btw...SimpleLoginSecure\nMakes authentication simple and secure.
