I find a lot of answers on how to reference a GitHub issue in a git commit (using the #xxx notation).\nI\'d like to reference a commit in my comment, generating a link to the commit details page?To reference a commit, simply write its SHA-hash, and it\'ll automatically get turned into a link.Answer above is missing an example which might not be obvious (it wasn\'t to me).Url could be broken down into parts Hash can be found here (you can click it and will get the url from browser).Hope this saves you some time.
