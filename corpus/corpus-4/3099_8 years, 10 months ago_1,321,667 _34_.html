I\'m trying to install a site under an alternative port on a server, but the port may be closed by a firewall. Is there a way to ping out or in, on a specific port, to see if it is open?Assuming that it\'s a TCP (rather than UDP) port that you\'re trying to use:On the server itself, use netstat -an to check to see which ports are listeningFrom outside, just telnet host port (or telnet host:port on Unix systems) to see if the connection is refused, accepted, or timeoutsOn that latter test, then in general:On Win7 or Vista defaul option \'telnet\' is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file. To solve this, just enable it : Click Start, Control Panel, Programs, and then Turn Windows Features on or off. In the list, scroll down and select Telnet Client and click OK Just wanted to add that on Windows you can useto narrow down the results. You can also filter for LISTENING, ESTABLISHED, TCP and such. Mind it\'s case sensitive though.I did like that:from telnetAnd just make sure that firewall is off on that machine.On a Windows machine you can use PortQry from Microsoft to check whether an application is already listening on a specific port using the following command:If you\'re checking from the outside, not from the server itself, and you don\'t want to bother installing telnet (as it doesn\'t come with the last versions of Windows) or any other software, then you have native PowerShell:(Unfortunately this only works with PowerShell 4.0 or newer. To check your PS version, type $PSVersionTable.)(If you have a PSVersion < 4.0, you\'re out of luck. Check this table:Even though you can upgrade your version of powershell by installing the Windows Management Framework 4.0, it didn\'t do the trick for me, Test-NetConnection cmdlet is still not available).If telnet is not available, download PuTTY.  It is a far superior telnet, ssh, etc. client and will be useful in many situations, not just this one, especially if you are administering a server.Do you want a tool for doing it?  There is a website at http://www.canyouseeme.org/.  Otherwise, you need some other server to call you back to see if a port is open...Use this if you want to see all the used and listening ports on Windows server:See all open, listening, established ports:On windows server you can usepsping from Sysinternals is also very goodAnother option is tcping.For example:tcping host portThe PowerShell example above is only valid on versions of Windows above Windows 7. The cmdlet is not compatible with Windows 7.Here is what worked for me,It will confirm whether port is opened.I think the best one I got is this where you can check your own ports as well as other domain\'s ports too.www.checkmyports.netOther utility that I found and is good and small as well, \nPortQry Command Line Port Scanner Version 2.0\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17148you can ping a server and a port and it will tell you the state of the port, there is a command line utility and a UI for it.
