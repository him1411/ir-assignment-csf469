I have a UIImageView and the objective is to scale it down proportionally by giving it either a height or width. The image did get resized but the position is not at the top left. What is the best approach to scaling image/imageView and how do I correct the position?Fixed easily, once I found the documentation!I\'ve seen a bit of conversation about scale types so I decided to put together an article regarding some of the most popular content mode scaling types.The associated image is here:I just tried this, and UIImage does not support _imageScaledToSize.I ended up adding a method to UIImage using a category - a suggestion I found on the Apple Dev forums.In a project-wide .h -Implementation:You could try making the imageView size match the image. The following code is not tested.The original code posted at the top worked well for me in iOS 4.2. I found that creating a CGRect and specifying all the top, left, width, and height values was the easiest way to adjust the position in my case, which was using a UIImageView inside a table cell. (Still need to add code to release objects)one can resize an UIImage this waySet your ImageView by selecting Mode to Aspect Fill and check the Clip Subviews box.This works fine for me Swift 2.x:UIImageView+Scale.h:UIImageView+Scale.m:For Swift :Set your UIimageview by scale.........I used following code.where imageCoverView is UIView holds UIImageViewIf the solutions proposed here aren\'t working for you, and your image asset is actually a PDF, note that XCode actually treats PDFs differently than image files. In particular, it doesn\'t seem able to scale to fill properly with a PDF: it ends up tiled instead. This drove me crazy until I figured out that the issue was the PDF format. Convert to JPG and you should be good to go.Usually I use this method for my apps (Swift 2.x compatible):I think you can do something likeHere is how you can scale it easily.This works in 2.x with the Simulator and the iPhone.
