I am working on a WPF, C#3.0 Project and I am getting this error:Error 1 Metadata file\n  \'WORK=-\\Tools\\VersionManagementSystem\\BusinessLogicLayer\\bin\\Debug\\BusinessLogicLayer.dll\'\n  could not be\n  found C:-=WORK=-\\Tools\\VersionManagementSystem\\VersionManagementSystem\\CSC VersionManagementSystemEDIT:This is how I reference my usercontrolsIt happens after every failed build. The only way I can get the solution to compile is to comment out all my user controls and and built the project, then I uncomment the usercontrols and everything is fine.I have checked build orders, dependencies configurations.As you can see it seems to have truncated the dll\'s absolute path... I have read that there is a bug with the length. Is this a possible problem?It\'s very annoying and having to comment, build, uncomment, build is becoming extremely tiresome.I just had the same problem. Visual Studio isn\'t building the project that\'s being referenced.Even though this is an old question, this can still happen in newer versions of VS (I just had it happen on VS 2013), so I thought I would just add this tip here:Another thing to try, is to close VS and delete the .suo file that is next to the .sln file. (It will be re-generated the next time you Save all (or exit VS)).I\'ve had this problem when adding new projects to the solution on another machine and then pulling the revisions in, but the .suo file can be corrupted in other cases as well and lead to very strange VS behaviour, so deleting it is one of the things I always try. Note that deleting the .suo file will reset the startup project(s) of the solution.More on the .suo file hereWell, my answer is not just the summary of all the solutions, but it offers more than that. Section (1):In general solutions:I had 4 errors of this kind (\xe2\x80\x98metadata file could not be found\xe2\x80\x99) along with 1 error saying \'Source File Could Not Be Opened (\xe2\x80\x98Unspecified error \xe2\x80\x98)\'.I tried to get rid of \xe2\x80\x98metadata file could not be found\xe2\x80\x99 error. For that, I read many posts, blogs etc and found these solutions may be effective (summarizing them over here):Restart VS and try building again.Go to \'Solution Explorer\'. Right click on Solution. Go to Properties. Go to \'Configuration Manager\'. Check if the checkboxes under \'Build\' are checked or not. If any or all of them are unchecked, then check them and try building again.If the above solution(s) do not work, then follow sequence mentioned in step 2 above, and even if all the checkboxes are checked, uncheck them, check again and try to build again.Build Order and Project Dependencies:Go to \'Solution Explorer\'. Right click on Solution. Go to \'Project Dependencies...\'. You will see 2 tabs: \'Dependencies\' and \'Build Order\'. This build order is the one in which solution builds. Check the project dependencies and the build order to verify if some project (say \'project1\') which is dependent on other (say \'project2\') is trying to build before that one (project2). This might be the cause for the error. Check the path of the missing .dll:Check the path of the missing .dll. If the path contains space or any other invalid path character, remove it and try building again.If this is the cause, then adjust the build order.Section (2):My particular case:I tried all the steps above with various permutations and combinations with restarting VS few times. But, it did not help me. So, I decided to get rid of other error I was coming across (\'Source File Could Not Be Opened (\xe2\x80\x98Unspecified error \xe2\x80\x98)\'). I came across a blog: \nhttp://www.anujvarma.com/tfs-errorsource-file-could-not-be-opened-unspecified-error/#comment-1539 I tried the steps mentioned in that blog and I got rid of the error \'Source File Could Not Be Opened (\xe2\x80\x98Unspecified error \xe2\x80\x98)\' and surprisingly I got rid of other errors (\xe2\x80\x98metadata file could not be found\xe2\x80\x99) as well.Section (3):Moral of the story:Try all solutions as mentioned in section (1) above (and any other solutions) for getting rid of the error. If nothing works out, as per the blog mentioned in section (2) above, delete the entries of all source files which are no longer present in the source control and the file system from your .csproj file. The suggested answer did not work for me.\nThe error is a decoy for another problem.\nFound out that I was targeting a slightly different version of .NET and this was flagged as a warning by the compiler but was causing building to fail.\nThis should have been flagged as an error and not warningClosing and reopening VS 2013 worked for me!I also met this problem. Firstly you have to manually build you DLL project, by right-click, Build. Then it will work.Well nothing above worked for me, so it got me thinking about why am I clicking and hoping when as developers we should really try to understand what is going on here.It seemed obvious to me that this incorrect meta data file reference must be held somewhere. A quick search of the .csproj file showed the guilty lines. I had a section called  that seemed to be hanging onto the old incorrect filepath.So a simple fix really:\n1) backup your .csproj\n2) find the incorrect paths in the .csproj file and rename appropriately please MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR OLD .CSPROJ BEFORE YOU FIDDLEI got the same error "Metadata file \'.dll\' could not be found" and I tried several things described above, but the reason for the error was that I was referencing third party dll which was targeting .Net version higher that my project target .Net version. So the solution was to change target framerork of my projectIn my case, I have my installed directory in mistaken ways.If your solution path is something like "My Project%2c Very Popular%2c Unit Testing%2c Software and Hardware.zip", it cannot resolve the metadata file, perhaps we should prevent some invalid words like %2c.Renaming the path into normal name resolved my issue.In my case it was cause by a .NET Framework version miss match.On project was 3.5 and the other referencing project 4.6.1I was pulling my hair out with this problem also, but after trying the above the only thing that worked for me was to open each project in my solution 1 by 1 and build them individually.Then I closed VS2013, reopened my solution and it compiled fine.It\'s strange because if I clicked each project in my solution explorer and tried to build them that way, they all failed. I had to open them alone in their own solutions.31st answer... I added a new project to my solution and started getting this.  The reason?  The project I brought in was targeting a different .Net framework  ( 4.6 and my other two were 4.5.2 ) For me the next steps worked: find the project that is not building remove/add references to projects within the solution.My instance of the problem was caused by a common project that had a duplicate class name in it (under a different filename).  Strange that VS could not detect that and instead just blew up the build process.For me, it was trying to find a DLL in a path that used to contain the Project, but we\'d moved it to a new directory. The Solution had the correct path to the Project, but Visual Studio somehow kept looking in the old location.Solution: Rename each problem Project - just add a character or whatever - then rename it back to its original name.This must reset some global cache of some kind in Visual Studio, because this clears both this issue up and several like it, while things like Clean do not.I was getting this problem in VS 2012 in a solution that has many projects. What fixed it for me was to rebuild each project in the solution manually in the same order as the Project Build Order (right-click and rebuild in Solution Explorer). Eventually I got to one that gave me a compile error. I fixed the error, and the solution would build correctly after that.For me occurred when I included a new Project to Solution.VS select automatic .net framework to 4.5. I changed to 4.5.2 version like others libraries and work.Hope it helps.Coming back to this a few years later. This problem is more than likely related to the Windows max path limit:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247%28VS.85%29.aspx#maxpathIn my case the issue was that I\'d manually deleted a non-compilation file which was marked as "missing".  Once I deleted the reference to the now-missing file and recompiled - all was well.Running VS2013.  It appears that the build dependencies were incorrect. Deleting the *.suo files did fix the problems I was having.I had this error when I was trying to publish a web application. Turned out that one of a class properties was wrapped intobut the property usage was not. The publishing was done in Release configuration without the DEBUG symbol, obviously.For my case it was that I as having commented out classes in a specific (empty) namespace. When I removed the namespace code and the import (using) commands of it - it fixed the problem. In the build it was also saying - along with the missing dll of the project: error CS0234: The type or namespace name \'W\' does not exist in the namespace \'X.Y.Z\' (are you missing an assembly reference?)In my case, these errors were caused by some corruption in the NuGet package manager.  Subprojects of the solution were not getting built, but no errors were showing because of the Metadata errors.  Once all the NuGet packages were corrected, the project can build properly again.In my case, the problem was caused by a simple build error:that, for any reason, did not show up in the error window.\nBecause of that, the VS build system seemed to miss the error and tried to build depending projects, which in turn failed with the annoying metadata message.The recommendation is -as stupid as it may sound-:\nFirst look at your Output Window!\nIt took me half an hour before this idea hit me...Couse of the problem may be that you have mixed adding references to dll and project in solution.if you have projects A, B and CA references B and C as a projects in solution.\nB references C as a dll (reference to file)you can build each project separatelly, but you can\'t rebuild solution ending with: Metadata file \'C.dll\' could not be found.Changing reference to file to a project in solution helps.In my personal case, I had failed to add a reference to one of the projects in the solution and this is what was kicking up the error for me.This error may be shown if you use fake assemblies, removing fakes leads to successfull build of the project.I received this error after opening a project in which Entity Framework was referenced, so I deleted such references, and reinstalled entity framework version 6.0.0.0 through packet manager this way:The error was still showing, so I thought that those references where there because there was an older version of EF supposedly "preinstalled" on the project, but not really working.So I went up to the file packages.config and noticed that there was another reference:Then I deleted the line, cleaned and rebuild the project and the container solution and it finally worked.Hope this helps someone with a similar situation.I had the same issue.  In my case, the project would still build in release mode and it was just when I tried to build in debug that it failed.What I ended up doing to fix the issue was simply copy all of the dlls (and other files from my release folder) into my debug folder.  After doing this for every project, the errors melted away.I had similar problem, when i decompiled very old library, which was deployed in production environment, but source codes were lost.I took .dll, decompiled and generated projects and solution. I was unable to build the solution due to several errors of this kind.Tips above did not help, but after a while i noticed that in some projects are missing references to several assemblies like System.dll.Suppose there is project A dependent on project B. There was no reference to System.dll in project B, but the error after build was like "Metadata file \'B.dll\' could not be found"There was no error about missing System.dll in project B.Adding reference on libraties like System.dll in project B solved the problem.\n(System.Data, System.DirectoryServices etc.)
