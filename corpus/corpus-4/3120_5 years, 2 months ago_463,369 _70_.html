I just installed SQL Server Express 2012 on my home server.  I\'m trying to connect to it from Visual Studio 2012 from my desktop PC, and repeatedly getting the well-known error:A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server)What I\'ve done to try to fix this:How can I get SQL Server 2012 Express to allow remote connections!?Well, glad I asked.  The solution I finally discovered was here:How do I configure SQL Server Express to allow remote tcp/ip connections on port 1433?So far, so good, and entirely expected.  But then:(Also, if you follow these steps, it\'s not necessary to enable SQL Server Browser, and you only need to allow port 1433, not 1434.)These extra five steps are something I can\'t remember ever having had to do in a previous version of SQL Server, Express or otherwise.  They appear to have been necessary because I\'m using a named instance (myservername\\SQLEXPRESS) on the server instead of a default instance.  See here:Configure a Server to Listen on a Specific TCP Port (SQL Server Configuration Manager)The correct way to connect to remote SQL Server (without opening UDP port 1434 and enabling SQL Server Browser) is to use ip and port instead of named instance.Using ip and port instead of named instance is also safer, as it reduces the attack surface area.Perhaps 2 pictures speak 2000 words...This method uses the specified port (this is what most people want I believe)..This method requires opening UDP port 1434 and SQL Server Browser running..One More Thing... Kyralessa provides great information but I have one other thing to add where I was stumped even after this article.Under SQL Server Network Configuration > Protocols for Server > TCP/IP Enabled.  Right Click TCP/IP and choose properties.  Under the IP Addresses you need to set Enabled to Yes for each connection type that you are using.You can also set Listen All to NO in the protocol dialog then in the IP address IP1 (say) set enabled to Yes, define yr IP address, set TCP Dynamic to Blank and TCP port to 1433 (or whatever) You can use this to solve this issue:Go to START > EXECUTE, and run CLICONFG.EXE.The Named Pipes protocol will be first in the list.Demote it, and promote TCP/IP.Test the application thoroughly.I hope this help.This article helped me...How to enable remote connections in SQL ServerEverything in SQL Server was configured, my issue was the firewall was blocking port 1433I had this problem recently. 2015 AugSolved by opening SQL Server Configuration ManagerCan connect to with SQL Server Manager to machine: [hostaddress], 1433Example:On my installation of SQL Server 2012 Developer Edition, installed with default settings, I just had to load the SQL Server Configuration Manager -> SQL Server Network Configuration -> Protocols for MSSQLSERVER and change TCP/IP from Disabled to Enabled.I had to add a firewall inbound port rule to open UDP port 1434. This is the one Sql Server Browser listens on. I prefer way of "Rosdi Kasim" as that\'s doesn\'t require detail configuration on the IP.I will definitely forget it again when I try to up another server again.Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) by simply enable the Sql Server Browser service, then add the \\SQLEXPRESS behind the IP when you connect the server.Direct using IP without "\\SQLEXPRESS" was my point of failure as it doesn\'t use the default port.Thanks.I had to add port via Configuration Manager and add the port number in my sql connection [host]\\[db instance name],1433Note the , (comma) between instancename and portAll you need to do is open the relevant port on the server\'s firewall.I had a different problem from what all of the answers so far mentioned!I should start off by saying that I had it in Visual Studio, and not SQL Server Express but the solution should be exactly the same.Well, god, it\'s actually really simple and maybe a bit foolish.\nWhen I tried to create a database and Visual Studio suggested the name of the SQL Server it gave me my Windows username and since it\'s actually the name of the server I went for it.In reality it actually was my Windows username + \\SQLEXPRESS. If you didn\'t change any settings this is probably yours too. If it works, stop reading; this is my answer. If it doesn\'t work maybe the name is different.If, like me, you only had this problem in Visual Studio to check what is yours follow these steps:This is the name of the server and this is what you should attempt to connect to! not what Visual Studio suggests!I had the same issue with SQL Server 2014 locally installed named instance. Connecting using the FQDN\\InstanceName would fail, while connecting using only my hostname\\InstanceName worked.  For example: connecting using mycomputername\\sql2014 worked, but using mycomputername.mydomain.org\\sql2014 did not.  DNS resolved correctly, TCP/IP was enabled within SQL Configuration Manager, Windows Firewall rules added (and then turned the firewall off for testing to ensure it wasn\'t blocking anything), but none of those fixed the problem.  Finally, I had to start the "SQL Server Browser" service on the SQL Server and that fixed the connectivity issue.  I had never realized that the SQL Server Browser service actually assisted the SQL Server in making connections; I was under the impression that it simply helped populate the dropdowns when you clicked "browse for more" servers to connect to, but it actually helps align client requests with the correct port # to use, if the port # is not explicitly assigned (similar to how website bindings help alleviate the same issue on an IIS web server that hosts multiple websites).This connect item is what gave me the clue about the SQL Server Browser service: https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/589901/unable-to-connect-on-localhost-using-fqdn-machine-name The reason for the "SQL Server Browser" service from TechNet (emphasis added by me): https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181087(v=sql.120).aspx From the "Using SQL Server Browser" section:If the SQL Server Browser service is not running, you are still able\n  to connect to SQL Server if you provide the correct port number or\n  named pipe. For instance, you can connect to the default instance of\n  SQL Server with TCP/IP if it is running on port 1433. However, if\n  the SQL Server Browser service is not running, the following\n  connections do not work:  If you are using SQL Server in a client-server scenario (for example,\n  when your application is accessing SQL Server across a network), if\n  you stop or disable the SQL Server Browser service, you must assign a\n  specific port number to each instance and write your client\n  application code to always use that port number. This approach has the\n  following problems: And more info from the same article from the "How SQL Server Browser Works" section: Because only one instance of SQL Server can use a port or pipe,\n  different port numbers and pipe names are assigned for named\n  instances, including SQL Server Express. By default, when\n  enabled, both named instances and SQL Server Express are configured to\n  use dynamic ports, that is, an available port is assigned when SQL\n  Server starts. If you want, a specific port can be assigned to an\n  instance of SQL Server. When connecting, clients can specify a\n  specific port; but if the port is dynamically assigned, the port\n  number can change anytime SQL Server is restarted, so the correct port\n  number is unknown to the client. ... When SQL Server clients request\n  SQL Server resources, the client network library sends a UDP message\n  to the server using port 1434. SQL Server Browser responds with the\n  TCP/IP port or named pipe of the requested instance. The network\n  library on the client application then completes the connection by\n  sending a request to the server using the port or named pipe of the\n  desired instanceOne more thing to check is that you have spelled the named instance correctly!This article is very helpful in troubleshooting connection problems: How to Troubleshoot Connecting to the SQL Server Database EngineIn my case the database was running on non standard port. Check that the port you are connecting is the same as the port the database is running on. If there are more instances of SQL server, check the correct one.
