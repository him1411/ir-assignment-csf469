I want to center a div which is added inside another div.This is the CSS I am currently using.As you can see,the approach I use now depends on values for width and height of innerDiv.If the width/height changes, I will have to modify the margin-top and margin-left values.Is there any generic solution that I can use to center the innerDiv always irrespective of its size?I figured out that using margin:auto can horizontally allign the innerDiv to the middle.But what about vertical allign middle?tl;drVertical align middle works, but you will have to use table-cell on your parent element and inline-block on the child.This solution is not going to work in IE6 & 7. Yours is the safer way to go for those. But since you tagged your question with CSS3 and HTML5 I was thinking that you don\'t mind using a modern solution.The classic solution (table layout)This was my original answer. It still works fine and is the solution with the widest support. Table-layout will impact your rendering performance so I would suggest that you use one of the more modern solutions.Here is an exampleTested in: HTMLCSSModern solution (transform)Since transforms are fairly well supported now there is an easier way to do it.CSSDemo \xe2\x99\xa5 my favourite modern solution (flexbox)I started to use flexbox more and more its also well supported now Its by far the easiest way.CSSDemoMore examples & possibilities:\nCompare all the methods on one pages Another way of achieving this horizontal and vertical centering is:(Reference)Outer Div must set its position to relative or fixed, and the Inner Div must set its position to absolute, top and left to 50% and apply a transform: translate(-50%, -50%).Tested in:Vertical Align Anything with just 3 lines of CSSHTMLSimplestCSSAccording to shouldiprefix this are the only prefixes you needYou can also use % as the value for the \'height\' property of .parent-of-element, as long as parent of element has height or some content that expands its vertical size.Instead of tying myself in a knot with hard-to-write and hard-to-maintain CSS (that also needs careful cross-browser validation!) I find it far better to give up on CSS and use instead wonderfully simple HTML 1.0:This accomplishes everything the original poster wanted, and is robust and maintainable.I personally prefer the trick of using a hidden pseudo element to span the full height of the outer container, and vertically aligning it with the other content.\nChris Coyier has a nice article on the technique. http://css-tricks.com/centering-in-the-unknown/\nThe huge advantage of this is scalability. You don\'t have to know the height of the content or worry about it growing/shrinking. This solution scales :).Here\'s a fiddle with all the CSS you\'ll need and a working example. \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/m5sLze0d/I have been using the following solution since over a year, it works with IE 7 and 8 as well.If you still didn\'t understand after reading the marvellous answers given above.Here are two simple examples of how you can achieve it. Using display: table-cellUsing flex-box (display: flex)Note: Check the browser compatibility of display: table-cell and flex before using the above mentioned implementations.enter image description here 100% it works https://jsfiddle.net/Mangesh1556/btn1mozd/4/When your height is not set (auto); you can give inner div some padding (top and bottom) to make it vertically center:you can do it by simply adding css style mentioned above. All the best. for query write commentfor innerdiv which do not specify it\'s height value,there is no pure css solution to make it vertically centered.a javascript solution could be get the innerdiv\'s offsetHeight,then calculate the style.marginTop.  You can do this with a simple javascript (jQuery) block.CSS:Javascript:try to align inner element like this:and of course:This works for me. Width and hight of the outer div can be defined.Here the code:You can center the div vertically and horizontally in CSS using flex;And the second one is as following;    And the resulting HTML:Fiddle Link <  http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/2515/>Try thisThis will work way back to IE6!<!DOCTYPE html> is required on IE6 too!\n[ will force IE6 default strict mode as well ].( of course, the box coloring is for demo purposes only )\ntext align-center on parent element, display inline-block on child element. This will center all most anything. I believe its call a "block float".This is also a good alternative for float\'s, good luck!I know that question was created year ago...\nAnyway thanks CSS3 you can easily vertically aligns div in div (example there http://jsfiddle.net/mcSfe/98/)
