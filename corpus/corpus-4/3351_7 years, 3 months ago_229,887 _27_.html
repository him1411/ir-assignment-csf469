Since localStorage (currently) only supports strings as values, and in order to do that the objects need to be stringified (stored as JSON-string) before they can be stored, is there a defined limitation regarding the length of the values.Does anyone know if there is a definition which applies to all browsers?Quoting from the Wikipedia article on Web Storage:Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity (10 MB per origin in Google Chrome(https://plus.google.com/u/0/+FrancoisBeaufort/posts/S5Q9HqDB8bh), Mozilla Firefox, and Opera; 10 MB per storage area in Internet Explorer) and better programmatic interfaces.And also quoting from a John Resig article [posted January 2007]:Storage SpaceIt is implied that, with DOM Storage,\n  you have considerably more storage\n  space than the typical user agent\n  limitations imposed upon Cookies.\n  However, the amount that is provided\n  is not defined in the specification,\n  nor is it meaningfully broadcast by\n  the user agent.If you look at the Mozilla source code\n  we can see that 5120KB is the default\n  storage size for an entire domain.\n  This gives you considerably more space\n  to work with than a typical 2KB\n  cookie.However, the size of this storage area\n  can be customized by the user (so a\n  5MB storage area is not guaranteed,\n  nor is it implied) and the user agent\n  (Opera, for example, may only provide\n  3MB - but only time will tell.)Actually Opera doesn\'t have 5MB limit. It offers to increase limit as applications requires more. User can even choose "Unlimited storage" for a domain. You can easily test localStorage limits/quota yourself.Here\'s a straightforward script for finding out the limit:Here\'s the gist, JSFiddle and blog post. The script will test setting increasingly larger strings of text until the browser throws and exception. At that point it\xe2\x80\x99ll clear out the test data and set a size key in localStorage storing the size in kilobytes.Don\'t assume 5MB is available - localStorage capacity varies by browser, with 2.5MB, 5MB and unlimited being the most common values.\nSource: http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/This snippet will find the maximum length of a String that can be stored in localStorage per domain.Note that the length of a string is limited in JavaScript; if you want to view the maximum amount of data that can be stored in localStorage when not limited to a single string, you can use the code in this answer.Edit: Stack Snippets don\'t support localStorage, so here is a link to JSFiddle.Chrome (45.0.2454.101): 5242878 characters\nFirefox (40.0.1): 5242883 characters\nInternet Explorer (11.0.9600.18036): 16386 122066 122070 charactersI get different results on each run in Internet Explorer.You don\'t want to stringify large objects into a single localStorage entry. That would be very inefficient - the whole thing would have to be parsed and re-encoded every time some slight detail changes. Also, JSON can\'t handle multiple cross references within an object structure and wipes out a lot of details, e.g. the constructor, non-numerical properties of arrays, what\'s in a sparse entry, etc. Instead, you can use http://rhaboo.org. It stores large objects using lots of localStorage entries so you can make small changes quickly. The restored objects are much more accurate copies of the saved ones and the API is incredibly simple. E.g.:BTW, I wrote it.I\'m doing the following:   I really like cdmckay\'s answer, but it does not really look good to check the size in a real time: it is just too slow (2 seconds for me). This is the improved version, which is way faster and more exact, also with an option to choose how big the error can be (default 250,000, the smaller error is - the longer the calculation is):To test:This works dramatically faster for the standard error; also it can be much more exact when necessary.
