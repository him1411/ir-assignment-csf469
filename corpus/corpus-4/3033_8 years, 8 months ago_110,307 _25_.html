Aside from writing an alias or script, is there a shorter command for getting the diff for a particular commit?If you only give the single commit id git diff 15dc8, it diffs that commit against HEAD.Use git show $COMMIT. It\'ll show you the log message for the commit, and the diff of that particular commit.Use:as described in the following fragment of git-rev-parse(1) manpage (or in modern git gitrevisions(7) manpage):Two  other  shorthands  for naming a set that is formed by a commit and its\n  parent commits exist. The r1^@ notation  means  all  parents  of  r1.  r1^!\n  includes commit r1 but excludes all of its parents.This means that you can use 15dc8^! as a shorthand for 15dc8^..15dc8 anywhere in git where revisions are needed.  For diff command the git diff 15dc8^..15dc8 is understood as git diff 15dc8^ 15dc8, which means the difference between parent of commit (15dc8^) and commit (15dc8).Note: the description in git-rev-parse(1) manpage talks about revision ranges, where it needs to work also for merge commits, with more than one parent. Then r1^! is "r1 --not r1^@" i.e. "r1 ^r1^1 ^r1^2 ..."Also, you can use git show COMMIT to get commit description and diff for a commit. If you want only diff, you can use git diff-tree -p COMMITIf you know how far back, you can try something like:Prior commits work something like this:There are a lot of ways you can specify commits:See this page for details.As @mipadi points out, you can use git show $COMMIT, but this also shows some headers and the commit message. If you want a straight diff, use git show --pretty=format:%b $COMMIT.This is, obviously not a very short hand, so I\'m keeping this alias in my .gitconfigThis enables me to use git sd $COMMITto show diff.Many of the mentioned examples (e.g. git diff 15dc8^!, or git diff 15dc8^..15dc8) don\'t work if you are using zsh and have extendedglob option set. You can fix it by one of the following three ways:unsetopt extendedglob (and/or remove it from .zshrc)setopt NO_NOMATCH (and/or set it in .zshrc)escape the caret and bang every time with a backslash, e.g. git diff 15dc8\\^\\!Paul\'s solution above did what I was hoping it would.Also, it\'s useful to add aliases like hobs mentioned, if you put the following in the [alias] section of your ~/.gitconfig file then you can use short-hand to view diff between head and previous.Then running $ git diff-last will get you your result. Note that this will also include any changes you\'ve not yet committed as well as the diff between commits. If you want to ignore changes you\'ve not yet committed, then you can use diff to compare the HEAD with it\'s parent directly:~1 means \'parent\', ~2 \'grandparent, etc.Uses aliases, so doesn\'t answer your question exactly but I find these useful for doing what you intend...
