When using the vim editor with the NERDTree plugin to navigate through the tree of your project, is there an easy way to create a new source code file under the currently highlighted directory?Currently I go into my shell, add the file and then refresh the tree. There must be a better way.Activate the NERDTree and navigate to the directory in which the new file should live. Then press m to bring up the NERDTree Filesystem Menu and choose a for "add child node". Then simply enter the file\'s (or directory\'s name) and you\'re done.From vim you can run shell commands. So in this case I use:and then hit r to reload the nerdtree window. The other thing to do is to just start the new file from within vim. One handy thing for this is that in my .vimrc I auto change the cwd to the directory my current file is in:This way if I\'m editing a file and want another one in the same place the path is changed right there. Opening any file from NERDTree sets the directory to the one that file is in.
