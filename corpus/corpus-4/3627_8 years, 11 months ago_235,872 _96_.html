I often use it as a place to store shortcuts (which you can do by drag-dropping) to files I am using right now. Generally this is more useful when I\'m working with a large or unfamiliar project. To show the Favorites Bar, select the following menu option:Tab \xe2\x87\xa5 OR Control \xe2\x8c\x83 /: Select the next auto-completion argument.Shift \xe2\x87\xa7 Tab \xe2\x87\xa5 OR Shift \xe2\x87\xa7 Control \xe2\x8c\x83 /: Select the previous auto-completion argument.Escape \xe2\x8e\x8b: Shows the auto completion pop-up list.When you attempt to undo after saving, you will get the following prompt:"You are about to undo past the last\n  point this file was saved.  Do you\n  want to do this?"To get rid of this warning, enter the following into a terminal window:Paste this into the Terminal application:If you hold down the three keys above, you can quickly jump to groups in the left (Groups and Files) page by pressing the first letter of a groups name. For example, Control \xe2\x8c\x83Option \xe2\x8c\xa5Shift \xe2\x87\xa7T takes you to Targets and Control \xe2\x8c\x83Option \xe2\x8c\xa5Shift \xe2\x87\xa7S to Source. Press it again and it jumps to SCM. Sometimes it takes several tries for this to work (I don\'t know why).Control \xe2\x8c\x83 .Shift \xe2\x87\xa7 Control \xe2\x8c\x83 .: Cycles backwards between autocompletion choices.  Control \xe2\x8c\x83. (Control-Period) after a word automatically accepts the first choice from the autocompletion menu. Try typing log then Control \xe2\x8c\x83.  and you\'ll get a nice NSLog statement. Press it again to cycle through any choices. To see all the mutable choices, type NSMu then Control \xe2\x8c\x83..Control \xe2\x8c\x83 Command \xe2\x8c\x98 ? (While your cursor is in the symbol to look up)Option \xe2\x8c\xa5 + <Double-click a symbol>Help > Quick HelpTo get to the documentation from the Quick Help window, click the book icon on the top right.Takes you straight to the full documentation.Use the above shortcut for a strange way of selecting multiple words. You can make selections of words in totally different places, then delete or copy them all at once. Not sure if this is useful. It\'s Xcode only as far as I can tell.This trick works in all Cocoa application on the Mac (TextEdit, Mail, etc.) and is possibly one of the most useful things to know.Pressing Shift \xe2\x87\xa7 with any of these selects the text between move points. Put the cursor in the middle of a line and press Shift \xe2\x87\xa7 Control ^ e and you can select to the end of the line.Pressing Option \xe2\x8c\xa5 will let you navigate words with the keyboard. Option \xe2\x8c\xa5 Control ^ f skips to the end of the current word. Option \xe2\x8c\xa5 Control ^ b skips to the beginning of the current word. You can also use Option \xe2\x8c\xa5 with the left and right arrow keys to move one-word-at-a-time. Try it with NSMutableArray. You can quickly change it to NSArray by putting your cursor after the NS, pressing Shift \xe2\x87\xa7 Control ^ Right Arrow then Delete.Command \xe2\x8c\x98 Shift \xe2\x87\xa7 DFile > Open Quickly...I\'m a big fan of the Open Quickly feature, which is particularly good in Xcode 3.1 and later. When you want to open a file or a symbol definition that\'s in your project or in a framework, just hit the keyboard shortcut, type a bit of the file or symbol\'s name, use Up Arrow \xe2\x86\x91 and Down Arrow \xe2\x86\x93 to pick to the right result (if need be), and then hit Return \xe2\x86\xa9 to open the file or navigate to the symbol definition.On Xcode 4:Also, something I didn\'t know about Xcode until two minutes ago (when schwa pointed it out in a comment) is that, if the editor\'s text caret is inside of a word when Open Quickly is invoked, that word will be used as the Open Quickly search term.You can use:... as a way to organize methods in your source files. When browsing symbols via the pop up menu, whatever you place in Foo will appear bold in the list.To display a separator (i.e. horizontal line), use:It\'s very useful, especially for grouping together delegate methods or other groups of methods.You should always have a breakpoint on objc_exception_throw.Use the following code:... to debug retain and release problems. For more information, see the "Finding Memory Leaks" section of Apple\'s Debugging Applications document.Command \xe2\x8c\x98 + Double-click on an object in Interface Builder\'s Document Window to jump to that class in Xcode. This is very handy with File\'s Owner.Drag a customized object back to Interface Builder\'s Library for later reuse.Control \xe2\x8c\x83 Shift \xe2\x87\xa7 + Click on an object in Interface Builder to see a menu of all of the objects under the mouse.Interface Builder Gesture Guide.Ctrl + 2: Access the popup list of methods and symbols in the current file.This is super useful because with this shortcut you can navigate through a file entirely using the keyboard. When you get to the list, start typing characters and the list will type-select to the symbol you are looking for.If your window displays both the detail and editor view, you can zoom the editor in to expand the editor view to the full height of the window. (This is fairly easily found, but many seem to overlook it.)You can do this by using one of the following methods:Command \xe2\x8c\x98 Shift \xe2\x87\xa7 EView > Zoom Editor InDrag the splitter (between the editor\n  window and the file list above it)\n  upwards.Get Colin Wheeler\'s Complete Xcode Keyboard Shortcut List (available as PDF or PNG).

Control Xcode\'s text editor from the command line: xed"Ctrl+Left/Right Arrow" to do intra-word text navigation.  I use this feature to jump the cursor from the one "camel hump" in a variable to the next.Xcode supports text macros that can be invoked via the Insert Text Macro menu at the end of the Edit menu.  They can also be invoked using Code Sense, Xcode\'s code completion technology.For example, Typing the key sequence p i m control-period will insert #import "file" into your code, with file as an editable token just like with code completion.Right click on a variable in your function and click edit all in scope.  Been using it a lot since I found this out.ctrl \xe2\x8c\x98 TYou can have Xcode run the preprocessor over your Info.plist file:See http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2007/tn2175.html for details.Debugging - how to use GDBBeing new to this still, I find trapping and identifying faults a rather\ndaunting job.

So I always forget to include the [ before I start typing the object name. Usually this meant I would need to go to the beginning of the line and add the [ manually. I didn\'t realize I could just press ] at the current cursor position, and it will be added automatically.There are ways to use this: either after typing the function\'s name, or right before typing the function\'s name.myObject testMethod]... becomes:... with the caret positioned after the ].myObject]... becomes:... with the caret positioned right before the ].The advantage of the latter (2) is that code completion will filter on the methods of your object. Whereas with the former (1) if you try to invoke code completion immediately after myObject, it won\'t be filtered. Another advantage to (2) is it behaves more like other programming languages that use dot notation. You type the name of the object then simply ] instead of . to access a method.Select a block of text and type cmd-/ to comment it out. Do it again to remove the comments characters.This is especially useful when combined with brace-matching by double-clicking on balanced chars (parens, braces, brackets).Being able to quickly see all the methods that can be overriden from a super class. For example when extending UITableViewController I just type in my implementation:and then I hit ESC to see all the methods from my superclass that begin with "ta" such as This also works when adopting protocols.Command \xe2\x8c\x98 alt \xe2\x8c\xa5 shift T : reveal the current edited file in the project tree.ctrl + alt + \xe2\x8c\x98 + r to clear the logApple\'s API reference documentation does not show methods inherited from a superclass. Sometimes, though. it\'s useful to be able to see the full range of functionality available for a class -- including a custom class of your own. You can use the Class Browser (from the Project menu) to display a flat or hierarchical list of all the classes related to a current project. The upper pane on the right hand side of the browser window shows a list of methods associated with the object selected in the browser. You can use the Configure Options sheet to select "Show Inherited Members" to show inherited methods as well as those defined by the selected class itself. You click the small book symbol to go to the corresponding documentation.
