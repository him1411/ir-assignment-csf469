This is a pretty simple question, at least it seems like it should be, about sudo permissions in Linux.There are a lot of times when I just want to append something to /etc/hosts or a similar file but end up not being able to because both > and >> are not allowed, even with root.Is there someway to make this work without having to su or sudo su into root?Using tee:Make sure to avoid quotes inside quotes.To avoid printing data back to the console:The problem is that the shell does output redirection, not sudo or echo, so this is being done as your regular user.Try the following code snippet:The issue is that it\'s your shell that handles redirection; it\'s trying to open the file with your permissions not those of the process you\'re running under sudo.Use something like this, perhaps:Doing should work. The problem is that > and >> are handled by your shell, not by the "sudoed" command, so the permissions are your ones, not the ones of the user you are "sudoing" into.I would note, for the curious, that you can also quote a heredoc (for large blocks):In bash you can use tee in combination with > /dev/null to keep stdout clean.Using Yoo\'s answer, put this in your ~/.bashrc:Now you can run sudoe \'deb blah # blah\' /etc/apt/sources.listEdit:A more complete version which allows you to pipe input in or redirect from a file and includes a -a switch to turn off appending (which is on by default):This worked for me:\noriginal commandWorking command Can you change the ownership of the file then change it back after using cat >> to append?Something like this work for you?
