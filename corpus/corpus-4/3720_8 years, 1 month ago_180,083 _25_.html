I have a poorly designed class in a 3rd-party JAR and I need to access one of its private fields. For example,\nwhy should I need to choose private field is it necessary?How can I use reflection to get the value of stuffIWant?In order to access private fields, you need to get them from the class\'s declared fields and then make them accessible:EDIT: as has been commented by aperkins, both accessing the field, setting it as accessible and retrieving the value will all throw Exceptions, although the only checked exceptions you need to be mindful of are commented above.The NoSuchFieldException would be thrown if you asked for a field by a name which did not correspond to a declared field. The IllegalAccessException would be thrown if the field was not accessible (for example, if it is private and has not been made accessible via missing out the f.setAccessible(true) line.The RuntimeExceptions which may be thrown are either SecurityExceptions (if the JVM\'s SecurityManager will not allow you to change a field\'s accessibility), or IllegalArgumentExceptions, if you try and access the field on an object not of the field\'s class\'s type:Try FieldUtils from apache commons-lang3:Reflection isn\'t the only way. An alternative solution is to extract the class from the .jar, decompile it using (say) Jode or Jad, change the field (or add an accessor), and recompile it against the original .jar. Then put the new .class ahead of the .jar in the classpath, or reinsert it in the .jar. (the jar utility allows you to extract and reinsert to an existing .jar)This requires the .jar not to be signed, of course.One other option that hasn\'t been mentioned yet: use Groovy.  Groovy allows you to access private instance variables as a side effect of the design of the language.  Whether or not you have a getter for the field, you can just use As oxbow_lakes mentions, you can use reflection to get around the access restrictions (assuming your SecurityManager will let you).That said, if this class is so badly designed that it makes you resort to such hackery, maybe you should look for an alternative. Sure this little hack might be saving you a few hours now, but how much will it cost you down the road?Use the Soot Java Optimization framework to directly modify the bytecode.\nhttp://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/Soot is completely written in Java and works with new Java versions.Using the Reflection in Java you can access all the private/public fields and methods of one class to another .But as per the Oracle documentation  in the section drawbacks they recommended that : "Since reflection allows code to perform operations that would be illegal in non-reflective code, such as accessing private fields and methods, the use of reflection can result in unexpected side-effects, which may render code dysfunctional and may destroy portability. Reflective code breaks abstractions and therefore may change behavior with upgrades of the platform"here is following code snapts to demonstrate basic concepts of Reflection Reflection1.javaReflection2.javaHope it will help.Just an additional note about reflection: I have observed in some special cases, when several classes with the same name exist in different packages, that reflection as used in the top answer may fail to pick the correct class from the object. So if you know what is the package.class of the object, then it\'s better to access its private field values as follows:(This is the example class that was not working for me)You need to do the following:
