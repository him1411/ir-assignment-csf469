Please help me understand the difference between a Generative and Discriminative Algorithm keeping in mind that I am just a beginner.Let\'s say you have input data x and you want to classify the data into labels y. A generative model learns the joint probability distribution p(x,y) and a discriminative model learns the conditional probability distribution p(y|x) - which you should read as "the probability of y given x".Here\'s a really simple example. Suppose you have the following data in the form (x,y):(1,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2, 1)p(x,y) isp(y|x) isIf you take a few minutes to stare at those two matrices, you will understand the difference between the two probability distributions.The distribution p(y|x) is the natural distribution for classifying a given example x into a class y, which is why algorithms that model this directly are called discriminative algorithms. Generative algorithms model p(x,y), which can be tranformed into p(y|x) by applying Bayes rule and then used for classification. However, the distribution p(x,y) can also be used for other purposes. For example you could use p(x,y) to generate likely (x,y) pairs.From the description above you might be thinking that generative models are more generally useful and therefore better, but it\'s not as simple as that. This paper is a very popular reference on the subject of discriminative vs. generative classifiers, but it\'s pretty heavy going. The overall gist is that discriminative models generally outperform generative models in classification tasks.A generative algorithm models how the data was generated in order to categorize a signal.  It asks the question: based on my generation assumptions, which category is most likely to generate this signal?A discriminative algorithm does not care about how the data was generated, it simply categorizes a given signal.Imagine your task is to classify a speech to a language:you can do it either by:1) Learning each language and then classifying it using the knowledge you just gainedOR2) Determining the difference in the linguistic models without learning the languages and then classifying the speech.the first one is the Generative Approach and the second one is the Discriminative approach.check this reference for more details: http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/~srihari/CSE574/Discriminative-Generative.pdfAlthough this topic is quite old, I think it\'s worth to add this important distinction. In practice the models are used as follows.In discriminative models to predict the label y from the training example x, you must evaluate:Which merely chooses what is the most likely class considering x. It\'s like we were trying to model the decision boundary between the classes. This behavior is very clear in neural networks, where the computed weights can be seen as a complex shaped curve isolating the elements of a class in the space. Now using Bayes\' rule, let\'s replace the   in the equation by . Since you are just interested in the arg max, you can wipe out the denominator, that will be the same for every y. So you are left withWhich is the equation you use in generative models. While in the first case you had the conditional probability distribution p(y|x), which modeled the boundary between classes, in the second you had the joint probability distribution p(x, y), since p(x, y) = p(x | y) p(y), which explicitly models the actual distribution of each class.With the joint probability distribution function, given an y, you can calculate ("generate") its respective x. For this reason they are called generative models.Generally, there is a practice in machine learning community not to learn something that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. For example, consider a classification problem where one\'s goal is to assign y labels to a given x input. If we use generative modelwe have to model p(x) which is irrelevant  for the task in hand.  Practical limitations like data sparseness will force us to model p(x) with some weak independence assumptions. Therefore, we intuitively use discriminative models for classification.I read an example from the lecture notes of CS299, which helps me REALLY understand the difference between discriminative learning algorithm and generative learning algorithm:suppose we have two classes of animals, elephant(y = 1) and dog(y = 0). And x is the feature of animals. Given a training set, an algorithm like logistic regression or\nthe perceptron algorithm (basically) tries to find a straight line\xe2\x80\x94that is, a\ndecision boundary\xe2\x80\x94that separates the elephants and dogs. Then, to classify\na new animal as either an elephant or a dog, it checks on which side of the\ndecision boundary it falls, and makes its prediction accordingly. We call these discriminative learning algorithm.Here\xe2\x80\x99s a different approach. First, looking at elephants, we can build a\nmodel of what elephants look like. Then, looking at dogs, we can build a\nseparate model of what dogs look like. Finally, to classify a new animal, \nwe can match the new animal against the elephant model, and match it against\nthe dog model, to see whether the new animal looks more like the elephants\nor more like the dogs we had seen in the training set. We call these generative learning algorithm.An addition informative point that goes well with the answer by StompChicken above.The fundamental difference between discriminative models and generative models is:Discriminative models learn the (hard or soft) boundary between classesGenerative models model the distribution of individual classesMy two cents:\nDiscriminative approaches highlight differences\nGenerative approaches do not focus on differences; they try to build a model that is representative of the class.\nThere is an overlap between the two.\nIdeally both approaches should be used: one will be useful to find similarities and the other will be useful to find dis-similarities.
