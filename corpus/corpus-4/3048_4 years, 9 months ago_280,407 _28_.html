I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to include an HTML snippet inside of an ng-repeat, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t get the include to work. It seems the current syntax of ng-include is different than what it was previously: I see many examples usingBut in the official docs, it says to useBut then down the page it is shown asRegardless, I triedMy snippet is not very much code, but it\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot going on; I read in Dynamically load template inside ng-repeat that that could cause a problem, so I replaced the content of sidepanel.html with just the word foo, and still nothing.I also tried declaring the template directly in the page like this:And running through all the variations of ng-include referencing the script\xe2\x80\x99s id, and still nothing.My page had a lot more in it, but now I\xe2\x80\x99ve stripped it down to just this:The header renders, but then my template doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. I get no errors in the console or from Node, and if I click the link in src="views/sidepanel.html" in dev tools, it takes me to my template (and displays foo).You have to single quote your src string inside of the double quotes:SourceORORPoints To Remember:--> No spaces in src--> Remember to use single quotation in double quotation for srcFor those trouble shooting, it is important to know that ng-include requires the url path to be from the app root directory and not from the same directory where the partial.html lives. (whereas partial.html is the view file that the inline ng-include markup tag can be found).For example:Correct: \n  div ng-include src=" \'/views/partials/tabSlides/add-more.html\' "> Incorrect: \n  div ng-include src=" \'add-more.html\' ">For those who are looking for the shortest possible "item renderer" solution from a partial, so a combo of ng-repeat and ng-include:<div ng-repeat="item in items" ng-include src="\'views/partials/item.html\'" />Actually, if you use it like this for one repeater, it will work, but won\'t for 2 of them!\nAngular (v1.2.16) will freak out for some reason if you have 2 of these one after another, so it is safer to close the div the pre-xhtml way:<div ng-repeat="item in items" ng-include src="\'views/partials/item.html\'"></div>Maybe this will help for beginnersThis worked for me:complete div:try this
