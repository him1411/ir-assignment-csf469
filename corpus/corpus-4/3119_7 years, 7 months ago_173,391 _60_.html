I want to use regions for code folding in Eclipse; how can that be done in Java?An example usage in C#:There\'s no such standard equivalent. Some IDEs - Intellij, for instance, or Eclipse - can fold depending on the code types involved (constructors, imports etc.), but there\'s nothing quite like #region.Jet Brains IDEA has this feature. You can use hotkey surround with for that (ctrl + alt + T). It\'s just IDEA feature.Regions there look like this:With Android Studio, try this:Careful : no blank line after //region ...And you will get:No equivalent in the language... Based on IDEs...For example in netbeans:NetBeans/Creator supports this syntax:http://forums.java.net/jive/thread.jspa?threadID=1311For Eclipse IDE the Coffee-Bytes plugin can do it, download link is here.EDIT:Latest information about Coffee-Bytes is here.Custom code folding feature can be added to eclipse using CoffeeScript code folding plugin.This is tested to work with eclipse Luna and Juno. Here are the stepsDownload the plugin from hereExtract the contents of archiveNavigate Window >Preferences >Java >Editor >Folding >Select folding to use: Coffee Bytes Java >General tab >Tick checkboxes in front of User Defined FoldCreate new region as shown:Try out if folding works with comments prefixed with specified starting and ending identifiersYou can download archive and find steps at this Blog also.This is more of an IDE feature than a language feature.  Netbeans allows you to define your own folding definitions using the following definition:As noted in the article, this may be supported by other editors too, but there are no guarantees.the fastest way in Android Studio (or IntelliJ IDEA)Contrary to what most are posting, this is NOT an IDE thing. It is a language thing. The #region is a C# statement.The best wayTip: Put ";" at the end of the "endregion"If anyone is interested, in Eclipse you can collapse all your methods etc in one go, just right click when you\'d normally insert a break point, click \'Folding\' > \'Collapse all\'. It know it\'s not an answer to the question, but just providing an alternative to quick code folding.Really only gets you any benefit in the IDE. With Java, there\'s no set standard in IDE, so there\'s really no standard parallel to #region.I were coming from C# to java and had the same problem and the best and exact alternative for region is something like below (working in Android Studio, dont know about intelliJ):the shortcut is like below:1- select the code2- press ctrl + alt + t3- press c and write your descriptionI usually need this for commented code so I use curly brackets at start and end of that. It could be used for code snippets but can create problems in some code because it changes the scope of variable.Actually johann, the # indicates that it\'s a preprocessor directive, which basically means it tells the IDE what to do.In the case of using #region and #endregion in your code, it makes NO difference in the final code whether it\'s there or not. Can you really call it a language element if using it changes nothing?Apart from that, java doesn\'t have preprocessor directives, which means the option of code folding is defined on a per-ide basis, in netbeans for example with a //< code-fold> statement\nIn Eclipse you can collapse the brackets wrapping variable region block. The closest is to do something like this:Just intall and enable Coffee-Bytes plugin (Eclipse)There is some option to achieve the same, Follow the below points.1) Open Macro explorer:2) Create new macro:3) Name it "OutlineRegions" (Or whatever you want)4) Right Click on the "OutlineRegions" (Showing on Macro Explorer) select the "Edit" option and paste the following VB code into it:5) Save the macro and close the editor.6) Now let\'s assign shortcut to the macro. Go to Tools->Options->Environment->Keyboard and search for your macro in "show commands containing" textbox (Type: Macro into the text box, it will suggest the macros name, choose yours one.)7) now in textbox under the "Press shortcut keys" you can enter the desired shortcut. I use Ctrl+M+N.Use: 8) Press the saved shortcut keySee below result:
