This question already has an answer here:I want excel files on a website to open in Excel when clicked, not get saved on desktop, or get opened embedded in a browser etc. Now obviously it all depends on how everything is configured for each user, but what\'s the best Content-Type and other settings to achieve just that most of the time?For BIFF .xls filesFor Excel2007 and above .xlsx filesDo keep in mind that the file.getContentType could also output application/octet-stream instead of the required application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet when you try to upload the file that is already open.
