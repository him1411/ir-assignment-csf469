Simple scheme:I need to set up a fixed width for <td>. I\'ve tried:Alsofor And evenBut the width of <td> is still the same.For Bootstrap 3.0:With twitter bootstrap 3 use: class="col-md-*" where * is a number of columns of width.For Bootstrap 2.0:With twitter bootstrap 2 use: class="span*" where * is a number of columns of width.** If you have <th> elements set the width there and not on the <td> elements.I was having the same issue, I made the table fixed and then specified my td width. If you have th you can do those as well.Template:Please use CSS for structuring any layouts.Instead of applying the col-md-* classes to each td in the row you can create a colgroup and apply the classes to the col tag.Demo hereIf you\'re using <table class="table"> on your table, Bootstrap\'s table class adds a width of 100% to the table. You need to change the width to auto.Also, if the first row of your table is a header row, you might need to add the width to th rather than td.In my case I was able to fix that issue by using min-width: 100px instead of width: 100px for the cells th or td.Hopefully this one will help someone:https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/863Try this -This combined solution worked for me, I wanted equal width columnsResult :-Hard to judge without the context of the page html or the rest of your CSS. There might be a zillion reasons why your CSS rule is not affecting the td element.Have you tried more specific CSS selectors such asThis to avoid your CSS being overridden by a more specific rule from the bootstrap css.(by the way, in your inline css sample with the style attribute, you misspelled width - that could explain why that try failed!)Ok, I just figured out where was the problem - in Bootstrap is set up as a default value width for select element, thus, the solution is:Anything else doesn\'t work me.I\'ve been struggling with the issue for a while, so just in case when someone makes the same stupid mistake as me...\nInside the <td> I had the element with white-space:pre style applied. That made all my table/tr/td tricks discarded. When I removed that style, suddenly all my text was nicely formatted inside the td.So, always check the main container (like table or td) but also, always check if you don\'t cancel your beautifull code somewhere deeper :)
