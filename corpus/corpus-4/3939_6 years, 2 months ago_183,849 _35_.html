I want to traverse all subdirectories, except the "node_modules" directory.FIND excluding directories foo and bar :GREP -R:\nyou know alreadyCombine FIND and GREP :If you frequently search through code, Ag (The Silver Searcher) is a much faster alternative to grep, that\'s customized for searching code. For instance, it automatically ignores files and directories listed in .gitignore, so you don\'t have to keep passing the same cumbersome exclude options to grep or find.Recent versions of GNU Grep (>= 2.5.2) provide:which excludes directories matching the pattern dir from recursive directory searches.So you can do:For a bit more information regarding syntax and usage seeFor older GNU Greps and POSIX Grep, use find as suggested in other answers.Or just use ack (Edit: or The Silver Searcher) and be done with it!If you want to exclude multiple directories : "r" for recursive, "l" to print only names of files containing matches and "i" to ignore case distinctions :Example : I want to find files that contain the word \'hello\'. I want to search in all my linux directories except proc directory, boot directory, sys directory and root directory :Note : The example above needs to be rootNote 2 (according to @skplunkerin) : do not add spaces after the commas in {dir1,dir2,dir3}Frequently use this:grep can be used in conjunction with -r (recursive), i (ignore case) and -o (prints only matching part of lines). To exclude files use --exclude and to exclude directories use --exclude-dir.Putting it together you end up with something like:Describing it makes it sound far more complicated than it actually is. Easier to illustrate with a simple example.Example: Suppose I am searching for current project for all places where I explicitly set the string value debugger during a debugging session, and now wish to review / remove. I write a script called findDebugger.sh and use grep to find all occurrences. However:For file exclusions - I wish to ensure that .eslintrc is ignored (this actually has a linting rule about debugger so should be excluded). Likewise, I don\'t want my own script to be referenced in any results. For directory exclusions - I wish to exclude node_modules as it contains lots of libraries that do reference debugger and I am not interested in those results. Also I just wish to omit .idea and .git hidden directories because I don\'t care about those search locations either, and wish to keep the search performant.So here is the result - I create a script called findDebugger.sh with:You could try something like grep -R search . | grep -v \'^node_modules/.*\'Very useful, especially for those dealing with Node.js where we want to avoid searching inside "node_modules":A simple working command:Above I grep for text "creativecommons.org" in current directory "dspace" and exclude dirs {log,assetstore}.Done.this one works for megrep <stuff> -R --exclude-dir=<your_dir>A simpler way would be to filter your results using "grep -v".grep -i needle -R * | grep -v node_modules
