How do I verify that method was NOT called in Moq? Does it have something like AssertWasNotCalled?UPDATE: Starting from Version 3.0, a new syntax can be used:UPDATE: Since version 3, check the update to the question above or Dann\'s answer below.Either, make your mock strict so it will fail if you call a method for which you don\'t have an expectOr, if you want your mock to be loose, use the .Throws( Exception )Run a verify after the test which has a Times.Never enum set. e.g.Stolen from: Need help to understand Moq betterOne of the things that you might want to test is that the pay method does not get called when a person aged over 65 is passed into the methodThis does not work in recent versions of Moq (since at least 3.1), it should be specified in the Verify method as mentioned in the\n  answer.Actually, it\'s better to specify .AtMost(0) after the Returns statement.Although the "throws" also works, AtMost(0) is more expressive IMHO.Use .AtMostOnce();After the real test, call the method again. If it throws an exception, it was called.
