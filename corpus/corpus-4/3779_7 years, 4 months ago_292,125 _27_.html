What is the effective way to replace all occurrences of a character with another character in std::string?std::string doesn\'t contain such function but you could use stand-alone replace function from algorithm header.I thought I\'d toss in the boost solution as well:The question is centered on character replacement, but, as I found this page very useful (especially Konrad\'s remark), I\'d like to share this more generalized implementation, which allows to deal with substrings as well:Usage:Outputs:Number_Of_BeansXXjXugtXtyhhjhugthtyEDIT:The above can be implemented in a more suitable way, in case performances are of your concern, by returning nothing (void) and performing the changes directly on the string str given as argument, passed by address instead of by value. This would avoid useless and costly copy of the original string, while returning the result. Your call, then...Code :Hope this will be helpful for some others...Imagine a large binary blob where all 0x00 bytes shall be replaced by "\\1\\x30" and all 0x01 bytes by "\\1\\x31" because the transport protocol allows no \\0-bytes.In cases where:the provided solutions cannot be applied (because they replace only single characters) or have a performance problem, because they would call string::replace several times which generates copies of the size of the blob over and over.\n(I do not know the boost solution, maybe it is OK from that perspective)This one walks along all occurrences in the source string and builds the new string piece by piece once:A simple find and replace for a single character would go something like:s.replace(s.find("x"), 1, "y")To do this for the whole string, the easy thing to do would be to loop until your s.find starts returning npos. I suppose you could also catch range_error to exit the loop, but that\'s kinda ugly.As Kirill suggested, either use the replace method or iterate along the string replacing each char independently. Alternatively you can use the find method or find_first_of depending on what you need to do. None of these solutions will do the job in one go, but with a few extra lines of code you ought to make them work for you. :-)If you\'re looking to replace more than a single character, and are dealing only with std::string, then this snippet would work, replacing sNeedle in sHaystack with sReplace, and sNeedle and sReplace do not need to be the same size. This routine uses the while loop to replace all occurrences, rather than just the first one found from left to right.This works! I used something similar to this for a bookstore app, where the inventory was stored in a CSV (like a .dat file). But in the case of a single char, meaning the replacer is only a single char, e.g.\'|\', it must be in double quotes "|" in order not to throw an invalid conversion const char. Uncustomarily I am using CentOS currently, so my compiler version is below . The C++ version (g++), C++98 default:If you\'re willing to use std::strings, you can use this sample-app\'s strsub function as-is, or update it if you want it to take a different type or set of parameters to achieve roughly the same goal. Basically, it uses the properties and functionalities of std::string to quickly erase the matching set of characters, and insert the desired characters directly within the std::string. Every time it does this replacement operation, the offset updates if it can still find matching chars to replace, and if it can\'t due to nothing more to replace, it returns the string in its state from the last update.If you don\'t want to rely on using std::strings as your parameters so you can pass in C-style strings instead, you can see the updated sample below:
