How can I get the selected value of a dropdown box using jQuery?\nI tried usingandbut both return an empty string.For single select dom elements, to get the currently selected value:To get the currently selected text:Should work fine, see this example:Try this jQuery,or this javascript,If you need to access the value and not the text then try using val() method instead of text().Check out the below fiddle links.Demo1 | Demo2try thisI know this is a terribly old post and I should probably be flogged for this pitiful resurrection, but I thought I would share a couple of VERY helpful little JS snippets that I use throughout every application in my arsenal...If typing out:is getting old, try adding these little crumpets to your global *.js file:and just write soval("#selector"); or sotext("#selector"); instead! Get even fancier by combining the two and returning an object containing both the value and the text!It saves me a ton of precious time, especially on form-heavy applications!Yet another tested example:this will do the trick This will alert the selected value.\nJQuery Code...HTML Code...Did you supply your select-element with an id?Your first statement should work!Try this, it gets the value:$(\'select#myField\').find(\'option:selected\').val(); Your first statement should work!!It will return the value of currently selected element.The id that got generated for your drop down control in the html will be dynamic one. So use the complete id $(\'ct100_<Your control id>\').val(). It will work. Or if you would try :I used It today and It working fine.useThis should work :)To get the jquery value from drop down you just use below function just sent id and get the selected value:I know this is old but I though I update this with an more up to date answer I hope this helpsuse either of these codes ORThis is what works For selected text use:For selected value use:You can use any of these:Just use thisOrAbove codes worked well for meYou need to put like this.
