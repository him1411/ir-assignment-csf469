I\'m trying to access a property of an object using a dynamic name. Is this possible?There are two ways to access properties of an object:The value between the brackets can be any expression. Therefore, if the property name is stored in a variable, you have to use bracket notation:In javascript we can access with:But only second case allows to access properties dynamically:Following is an ES6 example of how you can access the property of an object using a property name that has been dynamically generated by concatenating two strings. This is called computed property namesYou can achieve this in quite a few different ways.The bracket notation is specially powerful as it let\'s you access a property based on a variable:This can be extended to looping over every property of an object. This can be seem redundant due to newer JavaScript constructs such as for ... of ..., but helps illustrate a use case:Both dot and bracket notation also work as expected for nested objects:Object deconstructionWe could also consider object deconstruction as a means to access a property in an object, but as follows:This is my solution:Usage examples:It gets interesting when you have to pass parameters to this function as well.Code jsfiddleYou should use JSON.parse, take a look at https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.aspI have take comments below into consideration and agreed. Eval is to be avoided.Accessing root properties in object is easily achieved with obj[variable], but getting nested complicates thing. Not to write already written code I suggest to use lodash.get.ExampleLodash get can be used on different ways, here is link to the documentation lodash.get\nAccessing nested property can be trouble doing like object[\'key\'].You can use eval() to access both nested and not nested properties or even to create reference.If your object is not going to have nested properties I would suggest using [], otherwise eval() is better option.P.S.You can use eval() also to set value.Here is a method of getting a property or nested object from an object using path notation. It is an adaptation of a similar question answered by "Prusprus" in 2014.I\'ve got a configuration file with nested arrays, and want to access data from a web page by sending down a path in the form:"unit_cfg[2].chn_cfg[7].chn_type"This function will return a single propery or an object. Yes, it can be simplified...}
