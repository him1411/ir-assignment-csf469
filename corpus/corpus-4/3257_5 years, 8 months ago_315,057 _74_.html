Is there a way in handlebars JS to incorporate logical operators into the standard handlebars.js conditional operator? Something like this:I know I could write my own helper, but first I\'d like to make sure I\'m not reinventing the wheel.This is possible by \'cheating\' with a block helper. This probably goes against the Ideology of the people who developed Handlebars.You can then call the helper in the template like thisTaking the solution one step further.  This adds the compare operator.Use it in a template like this:Coffee Script versiontaking this one up a notch, for those of you who live on the edge.gist: https://gist.github.com/akhoury/9118682\nDemo: Code snippet belowThis looks a little large because I expanded syntax and commented over almost each line for clarity purposesif you want access upper level scope, this one is slightly different, the expression is the JOIN of all arguments, \nusage: say context data looks like this:Handlebars supports nested operations. This provides a lot of flexibility (and cleaner code) if we write our logic a little differently.In fact, we can add all sorts of logic:Just register these helpers:There is a simple way of doing this without writing a helper function... It can be done within the template completely.  Edit: Conversely you can do or\'s by doing this:  Edit/Note: From the handlebar\'s website: handlebarsjs.com here are the falsy values: You can use the if helper to conditionally render a block. If its\n  argument returns false, undefined, null, "" or [] (a "falsy" value),\n  Then any \'cond\' (like cond1 or cond2) will not be counted as true.One problem with all of the answers posted here is that they don\'t work with bound properties, i.e. the if condition is not re-evaluated when the properties involved change.  Here\'s a slightly more advanced version of the helper supporting bindings.  It uses the bind function from the Ember source, which is also used to implement the normal Ember #if helper.This one is limited to a single bound property on the left-hand side, comparing to a constant on the right-hand side, which I think is good enough for most practical purposes.  If you need something more advanced than a simple comparison, then perhaps it would be good to start declaring some computed properties and using the normal #if helper instead.You can use it like this:Improved solution that basically work with any binary operator (at least numbers, strings doesn\'t work well with eval, TAKE CARE OF POSSIBLE SCRIPT INJECTION IF USING A NON DEFINED OPERATOR WITH USER INPUTS):Here\'s a link to the block helper I use:  comparison block helper.  It supports all the standard operators and lets you write code as shown below.  It\'s really quite handy.Similar to Jim\'s answer but a using a bit of creativity we could also do something like this:Then to use it we get something like:I would suggest moving the object out of the function for better performance but otherwise you can add any compare function you want, including "and" and "or".One other alternative is to use function name in #if. The #if will detect if the parameter is function and if it is then it will call it and use its return for truthyness check. Below myFunction gets current context as this.Install Ember Truth Helpers addon by running the below command   ember install ember-truth-helpersyou can start use most of the logical operators(eq,not-eq,not,and,or,gt,gte,lt,lte,xor).You can even include subexpression to go further,    I can understand why you would want to create a helper for situations where you have a large number of varied comparisons to perform within your template, but for a relatively small number of comparisons (or even one, which was what brought me to this page in the first place), it would probably just be easier to define a new handlebars variable in your view-rendering function call, like:Pass to handlebars on render:and then within your handlebars template:I mention this for simplicity\'s sake, and also because it\'s an answer that may be quick and helpful while still complying with the logicless nature of Handlebars.I have found a npm package made with CoffeeScript that has a lot of incredible useful helpers for Handlebars. Take a look of the documentation in the following URL:https://npmjs.org/package/handlebars-helpersYou can do a wget http://registry.npmjs.org/handlebars-helpers/-/handlebars-helpers-0.2.6.tgz to download them and see the contents of the package.You will be abled to do things like {{#is number 5}} or {{formatDate date "%m/%d/%Y"}}if you just want to check if one or the other element are present you can use this custom helperlike thisif you also need to be able to have an "or" to compare \nfunction return values\n I would rather add another property that returns the desired result.The templates should be logicless after all!Unfortunately none of these solutions solve the problem of "OR" operator "cond1 || cond2".Use "^" (or) and check if otherwise cond2 is true{{#if cond1}}\n    DO THE ACTION\n{{^}}\n    {{#if cond2}}\n        DO THE ACTION\n    {{/if}}\n{{/if}}It breaks DRY rule. So why not use partial to make it less messyFor those having problems comparing object properties, inside the helper add this solutionEmber.js helper not properly recognizing a parameterHere we have vanilla handlebars for multiple logical && and || (and or):Not so sure if it\'s "safe" to use "and" and "or"... maybe change to something like "op_and" and "op_or"?Just came to this post from a google search on how to check if a string equals another string.I use HandlebarsJS in NodeJS server-side, but I also use the same template files on the front-end using the browser version of HandlebarsJS to parse it. This meant that if I wanted a custom helper, I\'d have to define it in 2 separate places, or assign a function to the object in question - too much effort!!What people forget is that certain objects have inherit functions that can be used in the moustache template. In the case of a string:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/matchAn Array containing the entire match result and any parentheses-captured matched results; null if there were no matches.We can use this method to return either an array of matches, or null if no matches were found. This is perfect, because looking at the HandlebarsJS documentation http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.htmlYou can use the if helper to conditionally render a block. If its argument returns false, undefined, null, "", 0, or [], Handlebars will not render the block.So...UPDATE: After testing on all browsers, this doesn\'t work on Firefox. HandlebarsJS passes other arguments to a function call, meaning that when String.prototype.match is called, the second argument (i.e. the Regexp flags for the match function call as per above documentation) appears to be being passed. Firefox sees this as a deprecated use of String.prototype.match, and so breaks.A workaround is to declare a new functional prototype for the String JS object, and use that instead:Ensure this JS code is included before you run your Handlebars.compile() function, then in your template...Following these 2 guides a-way-to-let-users-define-custom-made-bound-if-statements and custom bound helpers I was able to adjust my shared views in this post on stackoverflow to use this instead of the standard #if statement. This should be more secure than just tossing an #if in there.  The custom bound helpers in that gist are outstanding. I am using the ember cli project to build my ember application.Current setup at the time of this post:In Ember.js you can use inline if helper in if block helper. It can replace || logical operator, for example:You can do it simply by using the logical operator like this shown below:Before closing if you can write your business logicHere\'s an approach I\'m using for ember 1.10 and ember-cli 2.0.Then you can use it in your templates like this:Where the arguments to the expression are passed in as p0,p1,p2 etc and p0 can also be referenced as this.
