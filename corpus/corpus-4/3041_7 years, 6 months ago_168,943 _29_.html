I have directory A with files matching directory B. Directory A may have other needed files. Directory B is a git repo.I want to clone directory B to directory A but git-clone won\'t allow me to since the directory is non-empty.I was hoping it would just clone .git and since all the files match I could go from there?I can\'t clone into an empty directory because I have files in directory A that are not in directory B and I want to keep them.Copying .git is not an option since I want refs to push/pull with and I don\'t want to set them up manually.Is there any way to do this?Update: I think this works, can anyone see any problems? -->This worked for me:NOTE: -t will set the upstream branch for you, if that is what you want, and it usually is.In the following shell commands existing-dir is a directory whose contents match the tracked files in the repo-to-clone git repository.A slight modification to one of the answers that worked for me:to start working on the master branch straight away.Here\'s what I ended up doing when I had the same problem (at least I think it\'s the same problem). I went into directory A and ran git init.Since I didn\'t want the files in directory A to be followed by git, I edited .gitignore and added the existing files to it. After this I ran git remote add origin \'<url>\' && git pull origin master et vo\xc3\xadla, B is "cloned" into A without a single hiccup. This worked for me:Modified from @cmcginty\'s answer - without the -f it didn\'t work for meAnother simple recipe seems to work well for me:My main use case for checking out to a directory with existing files is to control my Unix dotfiles with Git.  On a new account, the home directory will already have some files in it, possibly even the ones I want to get from Git.I was looking for something similar, and here\'s what I came up with:My situation is one where I have an active web tree and I was trying to create a remote repository for it without moving any of the files in the current web tree.  Here\'s what I did:Maybe I misunderstood your question, but wouldn\'t it be simpler if you copy/move the files from A to the git repo B and add the needed ones with git add?UPDATE: From the git doc:Cloning into an existing directory is only allowed if the directory is empty.SOURCE: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clonethis is work for me \xef\xbc\x8cbut you should merge remote repository files to the local files:    I liked Dale\'s answer, and I also addedThe shallow depth avoided a lot of extra early dev commits. The new branch gave us a good visual history that there was some new code from this server that was placed in. That is the perfect use branches in my opinion. My thanks to the great insight of all the people who posted here.I have used this a few moments ago, requires the least potentially destructive commands:And voil\xc3\xa1!
