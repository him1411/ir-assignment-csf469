I have a simple loop with ng-repeat like this:There is a function in the controller $scope.removeTask(taskID).As far as I know Angular will first render the view and replace interpolated {{task.id}} with a number, and then, on click event, will evaluate ng-click string.In this case ng-click gets totally what is expected, ie: ng-click="removeTask(5)". However... it\'s not doing anything.Of course I can write a code to get task.id from the $tasks array or even the DOM, but this does not seem like the Angular way.So, how can one add dynamic content to ng-click directive inside a ng-repeat loop?Instead of do this:Please see this fiddle:http://jsfiddle.net/JSWorld/Hp4W7/34/One thing that really hung me up, was when I inspected this html in the browser, instead of seeing it expanded to something like:I saw:However, the latter works! This is because you are in the "Angular World", when inside ng-click="" Angular all ready knows about task.id as you are inside it\'s model. There is no need to use Data binding, as in {{}}.Further, if you wanted to pass the task object itself, you can like:Also worth noting, for people who find this in their searches, is this...Note the value of ng-click.  The parameter passed to goTo() is a string from a property of the binding object (the button), but it is not wrapped in quotes.  Looks like AngularJS handles that for us.  I got hung up on that for a few minutes.this works. thanks. I am injecting custom html and compile it using angular in the controller.Above answers are excellent. You can look at the following full code example so that you could exactly know how to use
