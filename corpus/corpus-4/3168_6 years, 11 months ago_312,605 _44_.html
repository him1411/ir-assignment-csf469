In order to duplicate an Array in Javascript,does anyone know (and maybe tested) if it\'s faster to use:Slice method:or For loop:UPDATE: (just to clarify myself) I know both ways do only a shallow copy: if original_array contains references to objects, objects won\'t be cloned, but only the references will be copied therefore both arrays will have references to the same objects.\nBut this is not the point of this question.I\'m asking only about speed.There are at least 5 (!) ways to clone an array:There has been a huuuge BENCHMARKS thread, providing following information:for blink browsers slice() is the fastest method, concat() is a bit slower, and while loop is 2.4x slower. for other browsers while loop is the fastest method, since those browsers don\'t have internal optimizations for slice and concat.This remains true in Jul 2016. Below are simple scripts that you can copy-paste into your browser\'s console and run several times to see the picture. They output milliseconds, lower is better.while loopslice Technically slice IS the fastest way, HOWEVER it is even faster if you add the 0 begin index.is faster than,http://jsperf.com/cloning-arrays/3what about es6 way?Easiest way to deep clone Array or Object:I put together a quick demo. http://jsbin.com/agugo3/editmy results on IE8 are 156/782/750, which would indicate slice is much faster in this case.As @Dan said "This answer becomes outdated fast. Use benchmarks to check the actual situation", there is one specific answer from jsperf that has not had an answer for itself: while:had 960,589 ops/sec with the runnerup a.concat() at 578,129 ops/sec, which is 60%.This is the lastest Firefox (40) 64 bit.It depends on browser. If you look at the link below there is a rough guide to performance of each: http://weblogs.asp.net/alexeigorkov/archive/2008/02/18/array-prototype-slice-vs-manual-array-creation.aspxResults: There is much more clean solution:The length check is required, because Array constructor behaves differently when it is called with exactly one argument.Since nobody has yet mentioned a.map(e => e) is another alternative for this job. As of today .map() is very fast (almost as fast as .slice(0)) in FF but not in Chrome.On the other hand, if an array is multi-dimensional since arrays are objects and objects are reference types none of the slice or concat methods will be a cure... So one proper way of cloning an array is an invention of Array.prototype.clone() as follows;Take a look at: link. It\'s not about speed, but comfort. Besides as you can see you can only use slice(0) on primitive types.To make an independent copy of an array rather than a copy of the refence to it, you can use the array slice method.Example:To make an independent copy of an array rather than a copy of the refence to it, you can use the array slice method.To copy or clone an object :Source: linkRemember .slice() won\'t work for 2 dimensional arrays. You\'ll need a function like this:It depends length of array. If array length is <= 1000000, slice and concat methods are taking approx same time. But when you give more range, concat method wins. \nFor example try this code If you give length of original_array 1000000, slice method and concat method are taking approx same time (3-4ms depends random numbers).If you give length of original_array 10000000, then slice method takes over 60ms and concat method takes over 20ms.A simple solution:
