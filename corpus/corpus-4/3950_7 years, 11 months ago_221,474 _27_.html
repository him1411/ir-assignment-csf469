I came across the following header format for Python source files in a document about Python coding guidelines:Is this the standard format of headers in the Python world?\nWhat other fields/information can I put in the header?\nPython gurus share your guidelines for good Python source headers :-)Its all metadata for the Foobar module.The first one is the docstring of the module, that is already explained in Peter\'s answer.The first line of each file shoud be #!/usr/bin/env python. This makes it possible to run the file as a script invoking the interpreter implicitly, e.g. in a CGI context.Next should be the docstring with a description. If the description is long, the first line should be a short summary that makes sense on its own, separated from the rest by a newline.All code, including import statements, should follow the docstring. Otherwise, the docstring will not be recognized by the interpreter, and you will not have access to it in interactive sessions (i.e. through obj.__doc__) or when generating documentation with automated tools.Import built-in modules first, followed by third-party modules, followed by any changes to the path and your own modules. Especially, additions to the path and names of your modules are likely to change rapidly: keeping them in one place makes them easier to find.Next should be authorship information. This information should follow this format:Status should typically be one of "Prototype", "Development", or "Production". __maintainer__ should be the person who will fix bugs and make improvements if imported. __credits__ differs from __author__ in that __credits__ includes people who reported bug fixes, made suggestions, etc. but did not actually write the code.Here you have more information, listing __author__, __authors__, __contact__, __copyright__, __license__, __deprecated__, __date__ and __version__ as recognized metadata.I strongly favour minimal file headers, by which I mean just:Everything else is a waste of time, visual space, and is actively misleading.If you have legal disclaimers or licencing info, it goes into a separate file. It does not need to infect every source code file. Your copyright should be part of this.  People should be able to find it in your LICENSE file, not random source code.Metadata such as authorship and dates is already maintained by your source control. There is no need to add a less-detailed, erroneous, and out-of-date version of the same info in the file itself.I don\'t believe there is any other data that everyone needs to put into all their source files. You may have some particular requirement to do so, but such things apply, by definition, only to you. They have no place in \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral headers recommended for everyone\xe2\x80\x9d.Here\'s a good place to start: PEP 257, which talks about Docstrings, and links to several other relevant documents.Also see PEP 263 if you are using a non-ascii charactersetThis PEP proposes to introduce a syntax to declare the encoding of\n      a Python source file. The encoding information is then used by the\n      Python parser to interpret the file using the given encoding. Most\n      notably this enhances the interpretation of Unicode literals in\n      the source code and makes it possible to write Unicode literals\n      using e.g. UTF-8 directly in an Unicode aware editor.In Python 2.1, Unicode literals can only be written using the\n      Latin-1 based encoding "unicode-escape". This makes the\n      programming environment rather unfriendly to Python users who live\n      and work in non-Latin-1 locales such as many of the Asian \n      countries. Programmers can write their 8-bit strings using the\n      favorite encoding, but are bound to the "unicode-escape" encoding\n      for Unicode literals.I propose to make the Python source code encoding both visible and\n      changeable on a per-source file basis by using a special comment\n      at the top of the file to declare the encoding.To make Python aware of this encoding declaration a number of\n      concept changes are necessary with respect to the handling of\n      Python source code data.Python will default to ASCII as standard encoding if no other\n      encoding hints are given.To define a source code encoding, a magic comment must\n      be placed into the source files either as first or second\n      line in the file, such as:or (using formats recognized by popular editors)or...
