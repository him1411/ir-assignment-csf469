Is there a way to check if the type of a variable in python is string.. likefor integer values?In Python 2.x, you would dobasestring is the abstract superclass of str and unicode. It can be used to test whether an object is an instance of str or unicode.Equivalent code:In Python 3.x, it would be(basestring is not defined in Python 3.)I know this is an old topic, but being the first one shown on google and given that I don\'t find any of the answers satisfactory, I\'ll leave this here for future reference:six is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library which already covers this issue. You can then do something like this:Inspecting the code, this is what you find:In Python 3.x or Python 2.7.6The type module also exists if you are checking more than ints and strings. \nhttp://docs.python.org/library/types.htmlEdit based on better answer below.  Go down about 3 answers and find out about the coolness of basestring.Old answer:\nWatch out for unicode strings, which you can get from several places, including all COM calls in Windows.since basestring isn\'t defined in Python3, this little trick might help to make the code compatible:after that you can run the following test on both Python2 and Python3Lots of good suggestions provided by others here, but I don\'t see a good cross-platform summary.  The following should be a good drop in for any Python program:In this function, we use isinstance(object, classinfo) to see if our input is a str in Python 3 or a basestring in Python 2.Also I want notice that if you want to check whether the type of a variable is a specific kind, you can compare the type of the variable to the type of a known object.For string you can use thisPython 2 / 3 including unicodehttp://python-future.org/overview.htmlAlternative way for Python 2, without using basestring:But still won\'t work in Python 3 since unicode isn\'t defined (in Python 3).returns Truereturns TrueTo test whether myvar is a string, can also use this:So,You have plenty of options to check whether your variable is string or not:This order is for purpose. Here is my answer to support both Python 2 and Python 3 along with these requirements:If you do not want to depend on external libs, this works both for Python 2.7+ and Python 3 (http://ideone.com/uB4Kdc):you can do:or:hope this helps!You can simply use the isinstance function to make sure that the input data is of format string or unicode. Below examples will help you to understand easily.By converting to string and testing with isdigit()This is how I do it:I\'ve seen: To test whether myvar is a string, use this:
