Here is a step by step of what I have done that worked great in Xcode 4 and 5 thanks to the links below.REF links:\nRename Project.\nRename Source Folder and other files.1- Backup your project. \nIf you are using git, commit any changes, make a copy of the entire project folder and backup in time machine before making any changes.2- Open your project.3- Slow double click or hit enter on the Project name (blue top icon) and rename it to whatever you like.NOTE: After you rename the project and press \xe2\x80\x98enter\xe2\x80\x99 it will suggest to automatically change all project-name-related entries and will allow you to de-select some of them if you want.

Here\'s what I do In Xcode 4.3.2:I make custom accessories with a bunch similar backend frameworks and icons. Nothing is perfect but this is a fast way to save a bunch of configuration clicks when apps have a lot of similarities. None of these worked for me.  The reason was that in Finder I had already manually changed oldAppName.xcodeproj to with the new name, so when I tried to edit the Project Name in Xcode 4, I got an error that it couldn\'t save newAppName.xcodeproj since it already existed.  The solution was to change, using Finder, newAppName.xcodeproj to and then I was able to edit the project name in Xcode and Xcode renamed the anyOtherName.xcodeproj to newAppName.xcodeproj.
