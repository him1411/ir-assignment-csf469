Can I create a Controller that simply returns an image asset?I would like to route this logic through a controller, whenever a URL such as the following is requested:The controller will look up topbanner.png and send that image directly back to the client.I\'ve seen examples of this where you have to create a View - I don\'t want to use a View. I want to do it all with just the Controller.Is this possible?Use the base controllers File method.As a note, this seems to be fairly efficient. I did a test where I requested the image through the controller (http://localhost/MyController/Image/MyImage) and through the direct URL (http://localhost/Images/MyImage.jpg) and the results were:Note: this is the average time of a request. The average was calculated by making thousands of requests on the local machine, so the totals should not include network latency or bandwidth issues.Using the release version of MVC, here is what I do:I obviously have some application specific stuff in here regarding the path construction, but the returning of the FileStreamResult is nice and simple.I did some performance testing in regards to this action against your everyday call to the image (bypassing the controller) and the difference between the averages was only about 3 milliseconds (controller avg was 68ms, non-controller was 65ms).  I had tried some of the other methods mentioned in answers here and the performance hit was much more dramatic... several of the solutions responses were as much as 6x the non-controller (other controllers avg 340ms, non-controller 65ms).To expland on Dyland\'s response slightly:Three classes implement the FileResult class: They\'re all fairly self explanatory:Below is an example of using the content-disposition technique (not tested):This might be helpful if you\'d like to modify the image before returning it:You can write directly to the response but then it isn\'t testable.  It is preferred to return an ActionResult that has deferred execution.  Here is my resusable StreamResult:I asked a similar question here Creating A Private Photo Gallery Using Asp.Net MVC and ended up finding a great guide to do this.I created an ImageResult class following this guide. http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2008/05/ASPNET-MVC-custom-ActionResult.aspxYou can create your own extension and do this way.Why not go simple and use the tilde ~ operator?UPDATE: There are better options than my original answer.  This works outside of MVC quite well but it\'s better to stick with the built-in methods of returning image content. See up-voted answers.You certainly can.  Try out these steps:Here\'s some sample code:Hope that helps!Look at ContentResult. This returns a string, but can be used to make your own BinaryResult-like class.Solution 1: To render an image in a view from an image URLYou can create your own extension method:Then use it like:Solution 2: To render image from databaseCreate a controller method that returns image data like belowAnd use it in a view like:To use an image rendered from this actionresult in any HTML, useSomeHelper.EmptyImageResult() should return FileResult with existing image (1x1 transparent, for example).This is easiest way if you have files stored on local drive.\nIf files are byte[] or stream - then use FileContentResult or FileStreamResult as Dylan suggested.I see two options:1) Implement your own IViewEngine and set the ViewEngine property of the Controller you are using to your ImageViewEngine in your desired "image" method.2) Use a view :-). Just change the content type etc.You could use the HttpContext.Response and directly write the content to it (WriteFile() might work for you) and then return ContentResult from your action instead of ActionResult.Disclaimer: I have not tried this, it\'s based on looking at the available APIs. :-)you can use File to return a file like View, Content etc
