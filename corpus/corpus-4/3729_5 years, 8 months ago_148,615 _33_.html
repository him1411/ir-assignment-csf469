Can anyone tell me how to use/locate LocalBroadcastManager as described in google docs and Service broadcast doc?I tried to google it, but there is no code available to start with?The documents say that i should use it if i want to do broadcast internally with in my app\'s process but i don\'t know where to look for thisAny help/comment?Update: I know how to use Broadcasts but don\'t know how to get LocalBroadcastManager available in my project.I\'ll answer this anyway. Just in case someone needs it. An activity that watches for notifications for the event named "custom-event-name".The second activity that sends/broadcasts notifications.With the code above, every time the button R.id.button_send is clicked, an Intent is broadcasted and is received by mMessageReceiver in ReceiverActivity.The debug output should look like this:I\'d rather like to answer comprehensively.LocalbroadcastManager included in android 3.0 and above so you have\nto use support library v4 for early releases. see instructions\nhereCreate a broadcast receiver:Register your receiver in onResume of activity like:unRegister receiver in onPause:Now whenever a localbroadcast is sent from applications\' activity or\nservice, onReceive of onNotice will be called :).Edit: You can read complete tutorial here LocalBroadcastManager: Intra application message passingIn Eclipse, eventually I had to add Compatibility/Support Library by right-clicking on my project and selecting:Android Tools -> Add Support LibraryOnce it was added, then I was able to use LocalBroadcastManager class in my code.On Receiving end: Then handle incoming intent data in onReceive.On Sending End:When you\'ll play enough with LocalBroadcastReceiver I\'ll suggest you to give Green Robot\'s EventBus a try - you will definitely realize the difference and usefulness of it compared to LBR. Less code, customizable about receiver\'s thread (UI/Bg), checking receivers availability, sticky events, events could be used as data delivery etc.An example of an Activity and a Service implementing a LocalBroadcastManager can be found in the developer docs. I personally found it very useful.EDIT: The link has since then been removed from the site, but the data is the following:\nhttps://github.com/carrot-garden/android_maven-android-plugin-samples/blob/master/support4demos/src/com/example/android/supportv4/content/LocalServiceBroadcaster.javawe can also use interface for same as broadcastManger here i am sharing the testd code for broadcastManager but by interface.first make an interface like:2-this is the first class that need implementation enter code here}3-here is the the second class that implement the same interface whose method call automaticallyso by this approach we can use the interface functioning same as broadcastManager.
