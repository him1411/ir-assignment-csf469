In my repository I have a branch called aq which I\'m working on.I then committed new work and bugs in master. What is the best way to get those commits into the aq branch? Create another new branch out of master and merge it with aq?Check out the aq branch, and rebase from master.You should be able to just git merge origin/master when you are on your aq branch.First check out to master:Do all changes, hotfix and commits and push your master.Go back to your branch, \'aq\', and merge master in it:Your branch will be up-to-date with master. A good and basic example of merge is 3.2 Git Branching - Basic Branching and Merging.There is no guarantee that the master bug fixes are not amongst other commits, hence you can\'t simply merge. Doassuming those commits represent the bug fixes.From now on though, keep bug fixes in a separate branch. You will be able to justwhen you want to roll them in to regular dev branch.Either cherry-pick the relevant commits into branch aq or merge branch master into branch aq.For me, I had changes already in place and I wanted the latest from the base branch.  I was unable to do rebase, and cherry-pick would have taken forever, so I did the following:so in this case:You have a couple options. git rebase master aqonto the branch which will keep the commit names, but DO NOT REBASE if this is a remote branch. You can git merge master aq if you don\'t care about keeping the commit names. If you want to keep the commit names and it is a remote branch git cherry-pick <commit hash> the commits onto your branch.Whatever the rebase or merge is right, but what if you have multiple commits in your branch aq, the rebase or merge will contains others people changes when you send pull request, or what if squash the commits into one commit, so I think I have a way(not the best way, but very safe and clear)
