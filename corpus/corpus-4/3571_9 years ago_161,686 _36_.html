What\'s the best way to extend the User model (bundled with Django\'s authentication app) with custom fields? I would also possibly like to use the email as the username (for authentication purposes).I\'ve already seen a few ways to do it, but can\'t decide on which one is the best.The least painful and indeed Django-recommended way of doing this is through a OneToOneField(User) property.â€¦If you wish to store information related to User, you can use a one-to-one relationship to a model containing the fields for additional information. This one-to-one model is often called a profile model, as it might store non-auth related information about a site user.That said, extending django.contrib.auth.models.User and supplanting it also works...Some kinds of projects may have authentication requirements for which Django\xe2\x80\x99s built-in User model is not always appropriate. For instance, on some sites it makes more sense to use an email address as your identification token instead of a username.[Ed: Two warnings and a notification follow, mentioning that this is pretty drastic.]I would definitely stay away from changing the actual User class in your Django source tree and/or copying and altering the auth module.Note: this answer is deprecated. see other answers if you are using Django 1.7 or later.This is how I do it.This will create a userprofile each time a user is saved if it is created. \nYou can then useHere is some more info from the docshttp://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#storing-additional-information-about-usersUpdate: Please note that AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE is deprecated since v1.5: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/settings/#auth-profile-moduleWell, some time passed since 2008 and it\'s time for some fresh answer. Since Django 1.5 you will be able to create custom User class. Actually, at the time I\'m writing this, it\'s already merged into master, so you can try it out.There\'s some information about it in docs or if you want to dig deeper into it, in this commit.All you have to do is add AUTH_USER_MODEL to settings with path to custom user class, which extends either AbstractBaseUser (more customizable version) or AbstractUser (more or less old User class you can extend).For people that are lazy to click, here\'s code example (taken from docs):There is an official recommendation on storing additional information about users.\nThe Django Book also discusses this problem in section Profiles.Since Django 1.5 you may easily extend the user model and keep a single table on the database.You must also configure it as current user class in your settings fileIf you want to add a lot of users\' preferences the OneToOneField option may be a better choice thought.A note for people developing third party libraries: if you need to access the user class remember that people can change it. Use the official helper to get the right classThe below one is another approach to extend an User.\nI feel it is more clear,easy,readable  then above two approaches.http://scottbarnham.com/blog/2008/08/21/extending-the-django-user-model-with-inheritance/Using above approach:You can Simply extend user profile by creating a new entry each time when user is created by using django post save signalsThis will automatically create a employee instance when new user is created.If you wish to extend user model and want to add further information while creating user you can use django-betterforms (http://django-betterforms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multiform.html). This will create a user add form with all fields defined in userProfile model.Extending Django User Model (UserProfile) like a ProI\'ve found this very useful: linkAn extract:from django.contrib.auth.models import UserNew in Django 1.5, now you can create your own Custom User Model (which seems to be good thing to do in above case). Refer to \'Customizing authentication in Django\'Probably the coolest new feature on 1.5 release.
