The arguments object in JavaScript is an odd wart\xe2\x80\x94it acts just like an array in most situations, but it\'s not actually an array object. Since it\'s really something else entirely, it doesn\'t have the useful functions from Array.prototype like forEach, sort, filter, and map.It\'s trivially easy to construct a new array from an arguments object with a simple for loop. For example, this function sorts its arguments:However, this is a rather pitiful thing to have to do simply to get access to the extremely useful JavaScript array functions. Is there a built-in way to do it using the standard library?You can actually just use Array\'s slice function on an arguments object, and it will convert it into a standard JavaScript array. You\'ll just have to reference it manually through Array\'s prototype:Why does this work? Well, here\'s an excerpt from the ECMAScript 5 documentation itself:NOTE: The slice function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method. Whether the slice function can be applied successfully to a host object is implementation-dependent.Therefore, slice works on anything that has a length property, which arguments conveniently does.If Array.prototype.slice is too much of a mouthful for you, you can abbreviate it slightly by using array literals:However, I tend to feel that the former version is more explicit, so I\'d prefer it instead. Abusing the array literal notation feels hacky and looks strange.If you are able to use ES6 you can use:Rest ParametersAs you can read in the linkThe rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.If you are curious about the ... syntax, it is called Spread Operator and you can read more here.Array.fromArray.from simply convert Array-like or Iterable objects into Array instances. Unfortunately, Array.from and Rest Parameters are currently only implemented in newer versions of Firefox and Google Chrome (check the Browser compatibility table in the above links ) but you can use a transpiler like Babel to efficently write ES6 code with really low compatibility issues.It\'s also worth referencing this Bluebird promises library wiki page that shows how to manage the arguments object into array in a way that makes the function optimizable under V8 JavaScript engine:This method is used in favor of var args = [].slice.call(arguments);. The author also shows how a build step can help reduce the verbosity.Some array methods are intentionally made not to require the target object to be an actual array. They only require the target to have a property named length and indices (which must be zero or larger integers).Use:Array(arg1, arg2, ...) returns [arg1, arg2, ...]Array(str1) returns [str1]Array(num1) returns an array that has num1 elementsYou must check number of arguments!Array.slice version (slower):Array.push version (slower, faster than slice):Move version (slower, but small size is faster):Array.concat version (slowest):If you\'re using jQuery, the following is a good deal easier to remember in my opinion:Here is benchmark of several methods converting arguments into array. As for me, the best solution for small amount of arguments is:For other cases:I recommend using ECMAScript 6 spread operator, which will Bind trailing parameters to an array. With this solution you don\'t need to touch the arguments object and your code will be simplified. The downside of this solution is that it does not work across most browsers, so instead you will have to use a JS compiler such as Babel. Under the hood Babel transforms arguments into a Array with a for loop.   If you can not use a ECMAScript 6, I recommend looking at some of the other answers such as @Jonathan FinglandUse Array.from(), which takes an array-like object (such as arguments) as argument and converts it to array:Note that it doesn\'t work in some older browsers like IE 11, so if you want to support these browsers, you should use Babel.In ECMAScript 6 there\'s no need to use ugly hacks like Array.prototype.slice(). You can instead use spread syntax (...).It may look strange, but it\'s fairly simple. It just extracts arguments\' elements and put them back into the array. If you still don\'t understand, see this examples:Note that it doesn\'t work in some older browsers like IE 11, so if you want to support these browsers, you should use Babel.Lodash:in action:produces:Another Answer.Use Black Magic Spells:Firefox, Chrome, Node.js, IE11 are OK.Try using Object.setPrototypeOf()Explanation: Set prototype of arguments to Array.prototypeExplanation: Take each index of arguments , place item into an array at corresponding index of array.could alternatively use Array.prototype.map()Explanation: Take each index of arguments , place item into an array at corresponding index of array.for..of loopor Object.create()Explanation: Create object, set properties of object to items at each index of arguments; set prototype of created object to Array.prototypeBenshmarck 3 methods :RESULT?Enjoy !Although rest parameters work well, if you want to continue to use arguments for some reason, consider[...arguments] can be considered a sort of alternative to Array.from(arguments), which also works perfectly well. An ES7 alternative is an array comprehension:This could be easiest if you want to process or filter the arguments prior to sorting:I tried simple destructing techniqueThe Arguments object is only available inside a function body. Although you can index the Arguments Object like an array, it is not an array. It does not have any array properties other than length. Although it can be indexed like an array as you can see in this example: However, the Arguments object is not an array and does not have any other properties other than length.You can convert the arguments object into an array at which point you can access the Arguments object. There are many ways you can access the arguments object inside a function body, and these include: Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) [].slice.call(arguments).This is a very old question, but I think I have a solution that is slightly easier to type than previous solutions and doesn\'t rely on external libraries:
