Is there a way to determine the device running an application. I want to distinguish between iPhone and iPod Touch, if possible.You can use the UIDevice class like this:This is an update for UIDeviceHardware.m from the answer above.Please feel free to use this class (gist @ github)CODE REMOVED AND RELOCATED TO https://gist.github.com/1323251UPDATE (01/14/11)Obviously, this code is a bit out of date by now, but it can certainly be updated using the code on this thread provided by Brian Robbins which includes similar code with updated models. Thanks for the support on this thread.I use this in my app. Up to date as of December 2012.Latest update - September 2017 Added iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, Apple Watch Series 3, Apple TV 4KPrevious update - June 2017: Added iPad Pro 10,5" iPad Pro 12,9" 2nd Gen(Tested on Swift 4, Swift 3)The function below returns a string with current device name.You can test it using following code:I also added new devices to the Objective-C codeDon\'t forget to import sys/sysctl.h You can test it using following code:Updated platform strings for iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3:More usableyou can reading properties with Here\'s a minor update with new models:I know an answer has been ticked already, but for future reference, you could always use the device screen size to figure out which device it is like so:Just adding the iPhone 4S device code to this thread...The iPhone 4S will return the string @"iPhone4,1".How about this code, if new version was released, you will identifier with the last know deviceAdding to Arash\'s code, I don\'t care for my app what model I\'m using, I just want to know what kind of device, so, I can test as follows:Based on the very good answers above, here is what I came up with. This is very similar to @Rodrigo\'s answer, but addresses @Oliver\'s concern from the comment on that answer. This also provides the option of including the model string in the output string.There\'s a pretty mature library (by me) for that called SDVersion.\nYou can check for running device\'s model, screen size and many other parameters. It also supports OSX.Example: I took it a bit further and converted the big "isEqualToString" block into a classification of bit masks for the device type, the generation, and that other qualifier after the comma (I\'m calling it the sub generation).  It is wrapped in a class with a singleton call SGPlatform which avoids a lot of repetitive string operations. Code is available https://github.com/danloughney/spookyGroupThe class lets you do things like this:and The classification of the devices is in the platformBits method.  That method should be very familiar to the readers of this thread.  I have classified the devices by their type and generation because I\'m mostly interested in the overall performance, but the source can be tweaked to provide any classification that you are interested in, retina screen, networking capabilities, etc..Below mentioned code snippet should help :Dutchie432 and Brian Robbins have provided great solutions. But there\'s still one model missing, the Verizon iPhone 4. Here\'s the missing line.I like Erica Sadun\'s stuff. She includes AppleTV devices and others you might not think of.https://github.com/erica/uidevice-extension/blob/master/UIDevice-Hardware.hAnswer in Swift 3,I\'d like to add that to retrieve the front and enclosure color of the device there\'s a private API:I\'ve blogged about this and provide a sample app:http://www.futuretap.com/blog/device-colors/I can assure that the above suggested one will work in iOS 7 and above. I believe it will work in iOS 6 too. But am not sure about that.You can check GBDeviceInfo on GitHub, also available via CocoaPods. It provides simple API for detecting  various properties with support of all latest devices:[GBDeviceInfo deviceDetails].family == GBDeviceFamilyiPhone;[GBDeviceInfo deviceDetails].model == GBDeviceModeliPhone6.For more see Readme.The possible vales ofare iPod touch, iPhone, iPhone Simulator, iPad, iPad Simulator\nIf you want to know which hardware iOS is ruining on like iPhone3, iPhone4, iPhone5 etc below is the code for thatNOTE: The below code may not contain all device\'s string, I\'m with other guys are maintaining the same code on GitHub so please take the latest code from thereObjective-C : GitHub/DeviceUtilSwift : GitHub/DeviceGuruTo identifiy iPhone 4S, simply check the following:Update platform string.
