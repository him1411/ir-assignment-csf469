I have a node package. When I run npm install from the package root, it installs a bunch of things, but then prints several error messages that look like this:npm WARN unmet dependency /Users/seanmackesey/google_drive/code/explore/generator/node_modules/findup-sync/node_modules/glob requires graceful-fs@\'~1.2.0\' but will loadI must be confused about what exactly npm install does. If it detects a dependency, shouldn\'t it install it? Under what conditions does it give me error messages like this, and how can I resolve the dependencies?I believe it is because the dependency resolution is a bit broken,\nsee https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/1341#issuecomment-20634338You may need to manually install top-level modules that have unmet dependencies:Or structure your package.json such that any top-level modules that are also dependencies of other modules are listed lower down.Your problem could also be that npm failed to download the package, timed-out or whatnot.  Sometimes re-running npm install remedies it. You can also install the failed packages\nmanually as well using npm install findup-sync@0.1.2. Other steps that may help before attempting npm install again are:To explain why removing node_modules sometimes is necessary: Apparently if a nested module fails to install during npm install, subsequent npm install won\'t detect those missing nested dependencies. If that\'s the case, sometimes it\'s sufficient to remove the top-level dependency of those missing nested modules, and running npm install again. See https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/1336It happened to me when the WIFI went down during an npm install. Removing node_modules and re-running npm install fixed it.I fixed the issue by using these command lines It\'s done!Upgrading NPM to the latest version can greatly help with this. dule\'s answer above is right to say that dependency management is a bit broken, but it seems that this is mainly for older versions of npm.The command npm list gives you a list of all installed node_modules. When I upgraded from version 1.4.2 to version 2.7.4, many modules that were previously flagged with WARN unmet dependency were no longer noted as such.To update npm, you should type npm install -g npm on MacOSX or Linux.  On Windows, I found that re-downloading and re-running the nodejs installer was a more effective way to update npm.The above answers didn\'t help me fully even after deleteting node_modules directory.Below command helped me finally: Note that this pulls node modules over an insecure HTTP connection. Src: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13119867/4082503For every -- UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY, for ex. -- UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY rxjs@5.0.0-rc.2, install that dependency with npm install --save rxjs@5.0.0-rc.2 until you don\'t have any more UNMET DEPENDENCIES.Good Luck.This solved it for me:Repeat these steps until there are no more errors.Some thing in the similar vein, I would add one other step.Note that on npm version > 1.4.9, \'npm install\' does install devDependencies. First try removing existing modules and cache:Then try:This at least will resolve the recursive dependency resolution.--dev installing devDependencies recursively (and its run forever..)\nhow it can help to resolve the version differences? You can try remove the node_moduls folder, then clean the npm cache and then run \'npm i\' againI was trying to work on an automated deployment system that runs npm install, so a lot of these solutions wouldn\'t work for me in an automated fasion. I wasn\'t in a position to go deleting/re-creating node_modules/ nor could I easily change Node.js versions.So I ended up running npm shrinkwrap - adding the npm-shrinkwrap.json file to my deployment bundle, and running installs from there. That fixed the problem for me; with the shrinkwrap file as a \'helper\', npm seemed to be able to find the right packages and get them installed for me. (Shrinkwrap has other features as well, but this was what I needed it for in this particular case).I encountered this problem when I was installing react packages and this worked for me:\n     npm install --save <package causing this error>I run npm list and installed all the packages listed as UNMET DEPENDENCYFor instance:\xe2\x94\x9c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80 UNMET DEPENDENCY css-loader@^0.23.1 \nnpm install css-loader@^0.23.1I had a similar issue while I was installing the React Native CLI. I wasn\'t sure which /node_modules directory I was supposed to remove after reading the answers here. I eventually just rannpm update -gand was able to install the package after that.Take care about your angular version, if you work under angular 2.x.x so maybe you need to upgrade to angular 4.x.xSome dependencies needs angular 4Here is a tutorial for how to install angular 4 or update your project.In my case, the update of npm solved it.Updating to 4.0.0Updating to 4 is as easy as updating your Angular dependencies to the latest version, and double checking if you want animations. This will work for most use cases.On Linux/Mac: On Windows:Then run whatever ng serve or npm start command you normally use, and everything should work.If you rely on Animations, import the new BrowserAnimationsModule from @angular/platform-browser/animations in your root NgModule. Without this, your code will compile and run, but animations will trigger an error. Imports from @angular/core were deprecated, use imports from the new package
