I have a string, let\'s say Hello world and I need to replace the char at index 3. How can I replace a char by specifying a index?I need something likeIn JavaScript, strings are immutable, which means the best you can do is create a new string with the changed content, and assign the variable to point to it.You\'ll need to define the replaceAt() function yourself:And use it like this:There is no replaceAt function in JavaScript. You can use the following code to replace any character in any string at specified position:You can\'t. Take the characters before and after the position and concat into a new string:There are lot of answers here, and all of them are based on two methods:Personally, I would use these two methods in different cases. Let me explain.@FabioPhms: Your method was the one I initially used and I was afraid that it is bad on string with lots of characters. However, question is what\'s a lot of characters? I tested it on 10 "lorem ipsum" paragraphs and it took a few milliseconds. Then I tested it on 10 times larger string - there was really no big difference. Hm.@vsync, @Cory Mawhorter: Your comments are unambiguous; however, again, what is a large string? I agree that for 32...100kb performance should better and one should use substring-variant for this one operation of character replacement.But what will happen if I have to make quite a few replacements?I needed to perform my own tests to prove what is faster in that case. Let\'s say we have an algorithm that will manipulate a relatively short string that consists of 1000 characters. We expect that in average each character in that string will be replaced ~100 times. So, the code to test something like this is:I created a fiddle for this, and it\'s here.\nThere are two tests, TEST1 (substring) and TEST2 (array conversion).Results:It seems that array conversion beats substring by 2 orders of magnitude! So - what the hell happened here???What actually happens is that all operations in TEST2 are done on array itself, using assignment expression like strarr2[p] = n. Assignment is really fast compared to substring on a large string, and its clear that it\'s going to win.So, it\'s all about choosing the right tool for the job. Again.Work with vectors is usually most effective to contact String.I suggest the following function:Run this snippet:In Javascript strings are immutable so you have to do something likeTo replace the character in x at i with \'h\'This works similar to Array.splice:@CemKalyoncu: Thanks for the great answer!I also adapted it slightly to make it more like the Array.splice method (and took @Ates\' note into consideration):I did a function that does something similar to what you ask, it checks if a character in string is in an array of not allowed characters if it is it replaces it with \'\'If you want to replace characters in string, you should create mutable strings. These are essentially character arrays. You could create a factory:Then you can access the characters and the whole array converts to string when used as string:I know this is old but the solution does not work for negative index so I add a patch to it. hope it helps someoneThis method is good for small length strings but may be slow for larger text.You can extend the string type to include the inset method:Then you can call the function:Lets say you want to replace Kth index (0-based index) with \'Z\'. \nYou could use Regex to do this.One-liner using String.replace with callback:The methods on here are complicated.\nI would do it this way:This is as simple as it gets.
