I\'m getting an error Variable is not assignable (missing __block type specifier)on the line aPerson = participant;. How can I make sure the block can access the aPerson variable and the aPerson variable can be returned?You need to use this line of code to resolve your problem:For more details, please refer to this tutorial : Blocks and VariablesJust a reminder of a mistake I made myself too, thedeclaration must be done when first declaring the variable, that is, OUTSIDE of the block, not inside of it. This should resolve problems mentioned in the comments about the variable not retaining its value outside of the block.Just use the __block prefix to declare and assign any type of variable inside a block.For example:To assign  a variable inside block which outside of block always use __block specifier before that variable your code should be like this:-I made myself too, thedeclaration must be done when first declaring the variable, that is, OUTSIDE of the block, not inside of it. This should resolve problems mentioned in the comments about the variable not retaining its value outside of the block.yes block are the most used functionality , so in order to avoid the retain cycle we should avoid using the strong variable,including self  inside the block, inspite use the _weak or weakself.Try __weak if you get any warning regarding retain cycle else use __blockNow you can refer weakPerson object inside block.
