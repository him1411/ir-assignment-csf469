How do I make Caps Lock work like Esc in Mac OS X?Here\'s my attempt at a comprehensive, visual walk-through answer (with links) of how to achieve this using Seil (formerly known as PCKeyboardHack).In the popup dialog set Caps Lock Key to No Action:2) Now, click here to download Seil and install it:3) After the installation you will have a new Application installed ( Mountain Lion and newer ) and  if you are on an older OS you may have to check for a new System Preferences pane:4) Check the box that says "Change Caps Lock" and enter "53" as the code for the escape key:And you\'re done! If it doesn\'t work immediately, you may need to restart your machine.You may also want to check out KeyRemap4MacBook which is actually the flagship keyboard remapping tool from pqrs.org - it\'s also free.If you like these tools you can make a donation. I have no affiliation with them but I\'ve been using these tools for a long time and have to say the guys over there have been doing an excellent job maintaining these, adding features and fixing bugs.Here\'s a screenshot to show a few of the (hundreds of) pre-selectable options:PQRS also has a great utility called NoEjectDelay that you can use in combination with KeyRemap4MacBook for reprogramming the Eject key.

The process is described in http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060825072451882\'>this hint.  As addendum to that hint I suggest you first set Caps-Lock to None in the System Preferences, then you only need to change one value in the .plist file.  Also, you can of course use the Property List Editor instead of going through the XML conversion steps.The trick is to map the Caps Lock key to the Help key (code 6), which isn\'t on most keyboards.  But if it is, it will be treated as the insert key, which you probably don\'t use anyway, since you ask about remapping your Caps Lock to prevent stretching your hands ;)You can then map the Help and the Insert key to Esc in vim.This will work for gvim (Vim.app).  I didn\'t get it to work with vim in the Terminal and I haven\'t tested it with MacVim.So, it\'s rather a complicated, half-baked solution or installing a third-party piece of hackery.  Your pick ;)Edit: Just noticed solution 3, if you\'re using MacVim you can use Ctrl, Option and Command as Esc.  With the System Preferences it\'s trivial to map Caps Lock to one of those keys.It is now much easier to map the Caps Lock key to Esc with macOS Sierra.Open System Preferences \xe2\x86\x92 Keyboard.Click the Modifier Keys button in the bottom right-hand corner.Click the drop down box next to the hardware key that you\xe2\x80\x99d like to remap, and select Escape.Click OK and close System Preferences.https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/25/remap-escape-key-action-macbook-pro-macos-sierra-10-12-1-modifier-keys/Seil isn\'t yet available on macOS Sierra (10.12 beta).

This can be done via the Keyboard & Mouse pane of System Preferences.  Click on "Modifier Keys" on the bottom left and you\'ll be able to remap Caps Lock, Control, Option, and Command, to any of those.@Craig:\nThis suggests that Caps Lock can be used as a normal -- that is, non-toggle -- key.  On my MacBook, since I have re-mapped Caps Lock to Control, the Caps Lock light never lights up.  It simply acts like the Control key.Having tried several of these solutions, I have some notes:DoubleCommand will not allow you to swap esc and caps-lock.PCKeyboardHack will allow you to map capslock to escape, but does not have the capability to map escape to capslock. Recent versions will allow you to perform a complete swap by editing both keys.This may or may not be sufficient for your needs (I know it is for mine).In case you don\'t want to install a third-party app and you really only care about vim inside iTerm, the following works:Remap CapsLock to Help as described here.Short version: use plutil or similar to edit ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences*.plist, it should look similar to this:Restart!

Then, in PCKeyboardHack, select the appropriate option that maps that keycode to escape (in the case of 110, it\'s "Application Key to Escape"). Here\'s what your KeyRemap4MacBook preferences should look like (provided you\'ve selected the "show enabled only" checkbox).I originally attempted to post this information as an edit to cwd\'s excellent answer, but it was rejected. I encourage anyone who wants to go the route that I describe to first read his/her response.Seil doesn\'t work on macOS Sierra yet, so I\'m using Karabiner Elements, download from https://pqrs.org/latest/karabiner-elements-latest.dmg.Either use the GUI or put the following into ~/.karabiner.d/configuration/karabiner.json:You can also use DoubleCommand to remap this, and other keys.IIRC, it will map Caps Lock to Esc.I came across this old thread in a search for the same functionality.
