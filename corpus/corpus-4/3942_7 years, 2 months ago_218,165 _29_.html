I have a WebView that is loading a page from the Internet. I want to show a ProgressBar until the loading is complete. How do I listen for the completion of page loading of a WebView?Implement WebViewClient and extend onPageFinished() as follows:@ian this is not 100% accurate. If you have several iframes in a page you will have multiple onPageFinished (and onPageStarted). And if you have several redirects it may also fail. This approach solves (almost) all the problems:UPDATE:According to the documentation:\nonPageStarted will NOT be called when the contents of an embedded frame changes, i.e. clicking a link whose target is an iframe.I found a specific case like that on Twitter where only a pageFinished was called and messed the logic a bit. To solve that I added a scheduled task to remove loading after X seconds. This is not needed in all the other cases.UPDATE 2:Now with current Android WebView implementation:I am pretty partial to @NeTeInStEiN (and @polen) solution but would have implemented it with a counter instead of multiple booleans or state watchers (just another flavor but I thought might share).   It does have a JS nuance about it but I feel the logic is a little easier to understand.I have simplified NeTeInStEiN\'s code to be like this:It is easy to understand, OnPageFinished if the previous callback is on onPageStarted, so the page is completely loaded.If you want show a progress bar you need to listen for a progress change event, not just for the completion of page:BTW if you want display just an Indeterminate ProgressBar overriding the method onPageFinished is enoughUse setWebViewClient() and override onPageFinished()I found one elegant solution as well, have not tested it rigorously though:You can trace the Progress Staus by the getProgress method in webview class.Initialize the progress statusthen the AsyncTask for loading like this:thanks for the answers. It helped me, but I had to improve it a bit for my needs. I had several pagestarts and finishes so I added a timer which checks if atfer the pagefinish is started a new pagestart. Okay, bad explanation. See the code :)Loading url with SwipeRefreshLayout and ProgressBar:\nUrlPageActivity.java:activity_url_page.xml:Here\'s a method which allows you to register a Runnable to be executed once a particular web address has finished loading. We associate each Runnable with a corresponding URL String in a Map, and we use the WebView\'s getOriginalUrl() method to choose the appropriate callback.Here\'s a novel method for detected when a URL has loaded by utilising Android\'s capability for JavaScript hooks. Using this pattern, we exploit JavaScript\'s knowledge of the document\'s state to generate a native method call within the Android runtime. These JavaScript-accessible calls can be made using the @JavaScriptInterface annotation.This implementation requires that we call setJavaScriptEnabled(true) on the WebView\'s settings, so it might not be suitable depending on your application\'s requirements, e.g. security concerns. src/io/github/cawfree/webviewcallback/MainActivity.java (Jelly Bean, API Level 16)res/layout/activity_main.xmlEssentially, we\'re appending an additional JavaScript function that is used to test the state of the document. If it\'s loaded, we launch a custom onPageLoaded() event in Android\'s MainActivity; otherwise, we register an event listener that updates Android once the page is ready, using window.addEventListener(\'onload\', ...);.Since we\'re appending this script after the call to this.getWebView().loadURL("") has been made, it\'s probable that we don\'t need to \'listen\' for the events at all, since we only get a chance to append the JavaScript hook by making a successive call to loadURL, once the page has already been loaded.
