$ nvm ls:I have to keep hitting nvm use v.0.11.13 in every session:I\'ve tried both the brew install, as well as the official installation script.My .profile for the brew version:And for the install.sh script:$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.10.0/install.sh | bashTry nvm alias default. For example:$ nvm alias default 0.12.7This sets the default node version in your shell. Then verify that the change persists by closing the shell window, opening a new one, then:\nnode --version Alias to node itself to avoid updating the default alias along with node version updates later on.To install the latest stable version:To set default to the stable version (instead of a specific version):To list installed versions:As of v6.2.0, it will look something like:nvm does its job by changing the PATH variable, so you need to make sure you aren\'t somehow changing your PATH to something else after sourcing the nvm.sh script.In my case, nvm.sh was being called in .bashrc but then the PATH variable was getting updated in .bash_profile which caused my session to find the system node before the nvm node.The top rated solutions didn\'t seem to work for me. My solution is below:In Terminal, follow the steps\nbelow(these are also listed when installing nvm via homebrew):mkdir ~/.nvm\ncp $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm-exec ~/.nvm/\nexport NVM_DIR=~/.nvm\nsource $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.shThe steps outlined above will add NVM\'s working directory to your $HOME path, copy nvm-exec to NVM\'s working directory and add to $HOME/.bashrc, $HOME/.zshrc, or your shell\'s equivalent configuration file.(again taken from whats listed on an NVM install using homebrew)This question has mentioned for the OSX, but it happened to me in my linux OS.\nI tried using nvm alias default <version> but for each new terminal session the used node version was forgotten.\nso, here is the solution that i figured out.make sure to set a default alias for node version,put the following code in .bashrc, and source .bashrc.descriptive solution linkrun this after you installed any version,This command is copying whatever version of node you have active via nvm into the /usr/local/ directory and setting the permissions so that all users can access them.Also in case you had node installed before nvm check in your ~/.bash_profile to not have something like :If you do have it, comment/remove it and nvm should start handling the default node version.
