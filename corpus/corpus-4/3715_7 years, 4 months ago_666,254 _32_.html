I am attempting to have a link show up in white, without an underline. The text color shows up correctly as white, but the blue underline is stubbornly persisting. I tried text-decoration: none; and text-decoration: none !important; in the CSS to remove the link underline. Neither worked. The HTML:The CSS:How can I remove the blue underline from the link?As I expected, you are not applying text-decoration: none; to an anchor (.boxhead a) but to a span element (.boxhead).Try this:The anchor tag (link) also has pseudo-classes such as visited, hover, link and active. Make sure your style is applied to the state(s) in question and that no other styles are conflicting.For example:See W3.org for more information on user action pseudo-classes :hover, :active, and :focus.text-decoration: none !important should remove it .. Are you sure there isn\'t a border-bottom: 1px solid lurking about? (Trace the computed style in Firebug/F12 in IE)Just add this attribute to your anchor tagstyle="text-decoration:none;"Example:Or use the CSS way. Without seeing the page, hard to speculate.But it sounds to me like you may have a border-bottom: 1px solid blue; being applied. Perhaps add border: none;. text-decoration: none !important is right, it\'s possible that you have another style that is still overriding that CSS though.This is where using the Firefox Web Developer Toolbar is awesome, you can edit the CSS right there and see if things work, at least for Firefox. It\'s under CSS > Edit CSS.As a rule, if your "underline" is not the same color as your text [and the \'color:\' is not overridden inline] it is not coming from "text-decoration:" It has to be "border-bottom:" Don\'t forget to take the border off your pseudo classes too!This snippet assumes its on an anchor, change to it\'s wrapper accordingly... and use specificity instead of "!important" after you track down the root cause.Sometimes what you\'re seeing is a box shadow, not a text underline.Try this (using whatever CSS selectors are appropriate for you):You missed  text-decoration:none for the anchor tag. So code should be following.More standard properties for text-decorationJust use the propertyand you are covered. Worked perfectly for me when text-decoration property dint work at all.While the other answers are correct, there is an easy way to get rid of the underline on all those pesky links:This will remove the underline from EVERY SINGLE LINK on your page!Here is an example for the asp.net webforms LinkButton control:Code behind:
