I am learning ASP.NET MVC, and I can read English documents, But I don\'t really understand what is happening with this code:What does this mean: { get; set; }?It\'s a so-called auto property, and is essentially a shorthand for the following (similar code will be generated by the compiler):So as I understand it {get; set;} is an "auto property" which just like @Klaus and @Brandon said is shorthand for writing a property with a "backing field." So in this case:However if you\'re like me - about an hour or so ago - you don\'t really understand what properties and accessors are, and you don\'t have the best understanding of some basic terminologies either. MSDN is a great tool for learning stuff like this but it\'s not always easy to understand for beginners. So I\'m gonna try to explain this more in-depth here.get and set are accessors, meaning they\'re able to access data and info in private fields (usually from a backing field) and usually do so from public properties (as you can see in the above example).There\'s no denying that the above statement is pretty confusing, so let\'s go into some examples. Let\'s say this code is referring to genres of music. So within the class Genre, we\'re going to want different genres of music. Let\'s say we want to have 3 genres: Hip Hop, Rock, and Country. To do this we would use the name of the Class to create new instances of that class.Now that we\'ve created the instances of the Genre class we can set the genre names using the \'Name\' property that was set way up above.We can set the name of \'g1\' to Hip Hop by writing the followingWhat\'s happening here is sort of complex. Like I said before, get and set access information from private fields that you otherwise wouldn\'t be able to access. get can only read information from that private field and return it. set can only write information in that private field. But by having a property with both get and set we\'re able do both of those functions. And by writing g1.Name = "Hip Hop"; we are specifically using the set function from our Name propertyset uses an implicit variable called value. Basically what this means is any time you see "value" within set, it\'s referring to a variable; the "value" variable. When we write g1.Name = we\'re using the = to pass in the value variable which in this case is "Hip Hop". So you can essentially think of it like this:It\'s Important to note that the above example isn\'t actually written in the code. It\'s more of a hypothetical code that represents what\'s going on in the background.So now that we\'ve set the Name of the g1 instance of Genre, I believe we can get the name by writingand if we ran this we would get "Hip Hop" in our console.So for the purpose of this explanation I\'ll complete the example with outputs as wellOutput:Those are automatic propertiesBasically another way of writing a property with a backing field.This is the short way of doing this:It is a shortcut to expose data members as public so that you don\'t need to explicitly create a private data members.  C# will creates a private data member for you.You could just make your data members public without using this shortcut but then if you decided to change the implementation of the data member to have some logic then you would need to break the interface.  So in short it is a shortcut to create more flexible code.It is an automatically implemented property.Basically Its a shortcut of:Its an auto-implemented property for C#.They are the accessors for the public property Name.You would use them to get/set the value of that property in an instance of Genre.That is an Auto-Implemented Property. It\'s basically a shorthand way of creating properties for a class in C#, without having to define private variables for them. They are normally used when no extra logic is required when getting or setting the value of a variable.You can read more on MSDN\'s Auto-Implemented Properties Programming Guide.This mean that if you create a variable of type Genre, you will be able to access the variable as a propertySuch { get; set; } syntax is called automatic properties, C# 3.0 syntaxYou must use Visual C# 2008 / csc v3.5 or above to compile.\nBut you can compile output that targets as low as .NET Framework 2.0 (no runtime or classes required to support this feature).Get set are access modifiers to property.\nGet reads the property field.\nSet sets the property value.\nGet is like Read-only access.\nSet is like Write-only access.\nTo use the property as read write both get and set must be used.In the Visual Studio, if you define a property X in a class and you want to use this class only as a type, after building your project you will get a warning that says "Field X is never assigned to, and will always has its default value".By adding a { get; set; } to X property, you will not get this warning.In addition in Visual Studio 2013 and upper versions, by adding { get; set; } you are able to see all references to that property.The get/set pattern provides a structure that allows logic to be added during the setting (\'set\') or retrieval (\'get\') of a property instance of an instantiated class, which can be useful when some instantiation logic is required for the property.A property can have a \'get\' accessor only, which is done in order to make that property read-onlyWhen implementing a get/set pattern, an intermediate variable is used as a container into which a value can be placed and a value extracted. The intermediate variable is usually prefixed with an underscore.\nthis intermediate variable is private in order to ensure that it can only be accessed via its get/set calls. See the answer from Brandon, as his answer demonstrates the most commonly used syntax conventions for implementing get/set.Get is invoked when the property appears on the right hand side (RHS)\nSet is invoked when the property appears on the left hand side (LHS)\nof \'=\' symbolFor an auto implemented property the backing field works behind the scene and not visible. Example :public string Log { get; set; }Whereas for an non auto implemented property the backing field is upfront, visible as a private scoped variable.Example :private string log;public string Log\n{\n    get\n    {\n    return this.log;\n    }\n    set\n    {\n    this.log = value;\n    }\n}Also it is worth noted here is the \'getter\' and \'setter\' can use the different \'backing field\'If you want to set the Property use this code:
