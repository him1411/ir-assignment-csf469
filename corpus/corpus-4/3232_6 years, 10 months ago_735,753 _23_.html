I know the POSIX sleep(x) function makes the program sleep for x seconds. Is there a function to make the program sleep for x milliseconds in C++?Note that there is no standard C API for milliseconds, so (on Unix) you will have to settle for usleep, which accepts microseconds:In C++11, you can do this with standard library facilities:Clear and readable, no more need to guess at what units the sleep() function takes.To stay portable you could use Boost::Thread for sleeping:This answer is a duplicate and has been posted in this question before. Perhaps you could find some usable answers there too.Depending on your platform you may have usleep or nanosleep available. usleep is deprecated and has been deleted from the most recent POSIX standard; nanosleep is preferred.In Unix you can use usleep. In Windows there is Sleep.nanosleep is a better choice than usleep - it is more resilient against interrupts.Why don\'t use time.h library? Runs on Windows and POSIX systems:corrected code - now CPU stays in IDLE state [2014.05.24]:If using MS Visual C++ 10.0, you can do this with standard library facilities:you will need:Syntax: Usage: The way to sleep your program in C++ is the Sleep(int) method. The header file for it is #include "windows.h."\nFor example: The time it sleeps is measured in milliseconds and has no limit. Select call is a way of having more precision (sleep time can be specified in nanoseconds).On platforms with select function (POSIX, Linux, Windows) you could do:However, there are better alternatives available nowadays.Use boost asio threads, Sleep for x millisec; As a Win32 replacement for POSIX systems:
