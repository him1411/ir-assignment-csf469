I am having a problem selecting nodes by attribute when the attributes contains more than one word.  For example:This is my xpath expression: //*[@class=\'atag\']The expression works with <div class="atag" /> but not for the previous example.  How can I select the <div>?This will select them  all regardless of the position of attributesmjv\'s answer is a good start but will fail if atag is not the first classname listed.The usual approach is the rather unwieldy:this works as long as classes are separated by spaces only, and not other forms of whitespace. This is almost always the case. If it might not be, you have to make it more unwieldy still:(Selecting by classname-like space-separated strings is such a common case it\'s surprising there isn\'t a specific XPath function for it, like CSS3\'s \'[class~="atag"]\'.)EDIT: see bobince\'s solution which uses contains rather than start-with, along with a trick to ensure the comparison is done at the level of a complete token (lest the \'atag\' pattern be found as part of another \'tag\')."atag btag"  is an odd value for the class attribute,  but never the less,  try:A 2.0 XPath that works:or with a variable:Be aware that bobince\'s answer might be overly complicated if you can assume that the class name you are interested in is not a substring of another possible class name. If this is true, you can simply use substring matching via the contains function. The following will match any element whose class contains the substring \'atag\':If the assumption above does not hold, a substring match will match elements you don\'t intend. In this case, you have to find the word boundaries. By using the space delimiters to find the class name boundaries, bobince\'s second answer finds the exact matches:This will match atag and not matag.try this: //[contains(@class, \'atag\')]To add onto bobince\'s answer...\nIf whatever tool/library you using uses Xpath 2.0, you can also do this:count() is apparently needed because index-of() returns a sequence of each index it has a match at in the string.You can try the followingBy.CssSelector("div.atag.btag")For the links which contains common url have to console in a variable. Then attempt it sequentially.I usually go with CSS selectors if there are more than one word separated by space (even if I could use ID):First dot means - it is Class, everything after it - class value (just replace all spaces with periods)If it is ID like this: <div id="atag btag" />\nYou can go with CSS: #atag.btag
