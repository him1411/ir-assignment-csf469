What is the easiest/shortest way to convert a Java 8 Stream into an array?The easiest method is to use the toArray(IntFunction<A[]> generator) method with an array constructor reference. This is suggested in the API documentation for the method.What it does, is find a method that takes in an integer (the size) as argument, and returns a String[], which is exactly what (one of the overloads of) new String[] does.You could also write your own IntFunction:The purpose of the IntFunction<A[]> generator is to convert an integer, the size of the array, to a new array.Example code:Prints:If you want to get an array of ints, with values form 1 to 10, from a Stream, there is IntStream at your disposal.Here we create a Stream with a Stream.of method and convert an Stream to an IntStream using a mapToInt. Then we can call IntStream\'s toArray method.Here is the same thing, without the Stream, using only the IntStreamYou can create a custom collector that convert a stream to array. and a quick useUsing the toArray(IntFunction<A[]> generator) method is indeed a very elegant and safe way to convert (or more correctly, collect) a Stream into an array of the same type of the Stream.However, if the returned array\'s type is not important, simply using the toArray() method is both easier and shorter.\nFor example:You can convert a java 8 stream to an array using this simple code block:But let\'s explain things more, first, let\'s  Create a list of string filled with three values:Create a stream from the given Array :we can now perform some operations on this stream Ex:and finally convert it to a java 8 Array using these methods:1-Classic method (Functional interface)2 -Lambda expression3- Method referenceMethod reference Explanation:It\'s another way of writing a lambda expression that it\'s strictly equivalent to the other.
