Is there a simple way to convert a string to title case? E.g. john smith becomes John Smith. I\'m not looking for something complicated like John Resig\'s solution, just (hopefully) some kind of one- or two-liner.Try  this:A slightly more elegant way, adapting Greg Dean\'s function:Call it like:Try to apply the text-transform CSS style to your controls.eg: (text-transform: capitalize); Only use a JS approach when absolutely necessary.Here\xe2\x80\x99s my function that converts to title case but also preserves defined acronyms as uppercase and minor words as lowercase:For example:Here\'s my version, IMO it\'s easy to understand and elegant too.If regex used in the above solutions is getting you confused, try this code:This works only for one word strings but that\'s what I needed:JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/simo/gou2uhLm/Just in case you are worried about those filler words, you can always just tell the function what not to capitalize.Hope this helps you out.Without using regex just for reference:I made this function which can handle last names (so it\'s not title case) such as "McDonald" or "MacDonald" or "O\'Toole" or "D\'Orazio". It doesn\'t however handle German or Dutch names with "van" or "von" which are often in lower-case... I believe "de" is often lower-case too such as "Robert de Niro". These would still have to be addressed.Try thisExampleSeems to work...\nTested with the above, "the quick-brown, fox? /jumps/ ^over^ the \xc2\xa1lazy! dog..." and "C:/program files/some vendor/their 2nd application/a file1.txt".If you want 2Nd instead of 2nd, you can change to /([a-z])(\\w*)/g.The first form can be simplified as:You could immediately toLowerCase the string, and then just toUpperCase the first letter of each word. Becomes a very simple 1 liner:Most of these answers seem to ignore the possibility of using the word boundary metacharacter (\\b). A shorter version of Greg Dean\'s answer utilizing it:Works for hyphenated names like Jim-Bob too.Here is my function that is taking care of accented characters (important for french !) and that can switch on/off the handling of lowers exceptions. Hope that helps.Taking the "lewax00" solution I created this simple solution that force to "w" starting with space or "w" that initiate de word, but is not able   to remove the extra intermediate spaces.The result is "Sof\xc3\xada Vergara".Use /\\S+/g to support diacritics:However: "sunshine (yellow)" \xe2\x87\x92 "Sunshine (yellow)"If you can use third party libraries in your code then lodash has a helper function for us.https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.3#startCaseAs full featured as John Resig\'s solution, but as a one-liner: (based on this github project)Simpler more performant version, with simple caching. ES 6elseFor those of us who are scared of regular expressions (lol):I think the simplest is using css. It\'s not short but here is what I came up with on a recent assignment in school:Prototype solution of Greg Dean\'s solution:This is based on my solution for FreeCodeCamp\'s Bonfire "Title Case", which requires you to first convert the given string to all lower case and then convert every character proceeding a space to upper case.Without using regex:My simple and easy version to the problem:Try this, shortest way:Robust Functional programming way to do Title Case FunctionExaplin VersionImplementation versionWe have been having a discussion back here at the office and we think that trying to automatically correct the way people input names in the current way you want it doing is fraught with possible issues.We have come up with several cases where different types of auto capitalization fall apart and these are just for English names alone, each language has its own complexities.Issues with capitalizing the first letter of each name:\xe2\x80\xa2   Acronyms such as IBM aren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to be inputted, would turn into Ibm.\xe2\x80\xa2   The Name McDonald would turn into Mcdonald which is incorrect, the same thing is MacDonald too.\xe2\x80\xa2   Double barrelled names such as Marie-Tonks would get turned into Marie-tonks.\xe2\x80\xa2   Names like O\xe2\x80\x99Connor would turn into O\xe2\x80\x99connor.For most of these you could write custom rules to deal with it, however, this still has issues with Acronyms as before and you get a new issue:\xe2\x80\xa2   Adding in a rule to fix names with Mac such as MacDonald, would the break names such as Macy turning it into MacY.The only solution we have come up with that is never incorrect is to capitalize every letter which is a brute force method that the DBS appear to also use.So if you want to automate the process it is as good as impossible to do without a dictionary of every single name and word and how it should be capitlized, If you don\'t have a rule that covers everything don\'t use it as it will just annoy your users and prompt people who want to enter their names correctly to go else where.
