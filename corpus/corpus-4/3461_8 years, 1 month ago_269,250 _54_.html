I have my project on GitHub at some location, git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git.Now I want to push all my code to a new repository at some other location, git@github.com:newname/newrep.git.I used the command:git remote add origin git@github.com:myname/oldrep.gitbut I am receiving this:fatal: remote origin already exists.You are getting this error because "origin" is not available. "origin" is a convention not part of the command. "origin" is the local name of the remote repository.For example you could also write:See the manual: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.htmlTo remove a remote repository you enter:Again "origin" is the name of the remote repository if you want to\nremove the "upstream" remote:The previous solutions seem to ignore origin, and they only suggest to use another name. When you just want to use git push origin, keep reading.The problem appears because a wrong order of Git configuration is followed. You might have already added a \'git origin\' to your .git configuration.You can change the remote origin in your Git configuration with the following line:This command sets a new URL for the Git repository you want to push to.\nImportant is to fill in your own username and projectnameIf you have mistakenly named the local name as "origin", you may remove it with the following:You can simply edit your configuration file in a text editor.In the ~/.gitconfig you need to put in something like the following:In the oldrep/.git/config file (in the configuration file of your repository):If there is a remote section in your repository\'s configuration file, and the URL matches, you need only to add push configuration. If you use a public URL for fetching, you can put in the URL for pushing as \'pushurl\' (warning: this requires the just-released Git version 1.6.4).You don\'t have to remove your existing "origin" remote, just use a name other than "origin" for your remote add, e.g.git remote add github git@github.com:myname/oldrep.gitI got the same issue, and here is how I fixed it after doing some research:Show status of the old repositoryType git remote -v to get the remote path for fetch and push remote. If your local repository is connected to a remote, it will show something like this:origin  https://user@bitbucket.org/team-or-user-name/myproject.git (fetch)\norigin  https://user@bitbucket.org/team-or-user-name/myproject.git (push)If it\'s not connected, it might show origin only.Now remove the remote repository from local repository by usingCheck again with step 4. It should show origin only, instead of the fetch and push path.Now that your old remote repository is disconnected, you can add the new remote repository. Use the following to connect to your new repository.Note: In case you are using Bitbucket, you would create a project on Bitbucket first. After creation, Bitbucket will display all required Git commands to push your repository to remote, which look similar to the next code snippet. However, this works for other repositories, too.That\'s it.I had the same problem when I first set up using Bitbucket.My problem was that I needed to change the word origin for something self-defined. I used the name of the application. So:You could also change the repository name you wish to push to in the REPOHOME/.git/config file(where REPOHOME is the path to your local clone of the repository).METHOD1->Since origin already exist remove it.METHOD2->One can also change existing remote repository URL by ->git remote set-urlIf you\'re updating to use HTTPSIf you\'re updating to use SSHIf trying to update a remote that doesn\'t exist you will receive a error. So be careful of that.METHOD3->Use the git remote rename command to rename an existing remote.\nAn existing remote name, for example, origin.To verify remote\'s new name->If new to Git try this tutorial->TRY GIT TUTORIALYou should change the name of the remote repository to something else.toI think this should work.Yes, these are for repository init and adding a new remote. Just with a change of name.This can also happen when you forget to make a first commit.
