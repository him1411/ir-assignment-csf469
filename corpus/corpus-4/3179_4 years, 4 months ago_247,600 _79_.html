Is there Node.js ready-to-use tool (installed with npm), that would help me expose folder content as file server over HTTP.Example, if I haveThen starting in D:\\Folder\\ node node-file-server.js\nI could access file viaWhy is my node static file server dropping requests?\nreference some mystical standard node.js static file serverIf there\'s no such tool, what framework should I use?Related:\nBasic static file server in NodeJSA good "ready-to-use tool" option could be http-server:To use it:Or, like this:Check it out: https://github.com/nodeapps/http-serverIf you do not want to use ready tool, you can use the code below, as demonstrated by me at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Node_server_without_framework:UPDATE\nIf you need to access your server from external demand/file, you need to overcome the CORS, in your node.js file by writing the below, as I mentioned in a previous answer hereUPDATEAs Adrian mentioned, in the comments, he wrote an ES6 code with full explanation here, I just re-posting his code below, in case the code gone from the original site for any reason:For people wanting a server runnable from within NodeJS script:You can use expressjs/serve-static which replaces connect.static (which is no longer available as of connect 3):myapp.js:and then from command line:I know it\'s not Node, but I\'ve used Python\'s SimpleHTTPServer:It works well and comes with Python.connect could be what you\'re looking for.Installed easily with:Then the most basic static file server could be written as:Install express using npm: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.htmlCreate a file named server.js at the same level of your index.html with this content:If you wish to put it in a different location, set the path on the third line:CD to the folder containing your file and run node from the console with this command:Browse to localhost:8080If you use the Express framework, this functionality comes ready to go.To setup a simple file serving app just do this:There is another static web server that is quite nice: browser-sync.It can be downloaded using node package manager:After installation, navigate to the project folder in the cmd prompt and just run the following:It will start catering all the files in the current folder in the browser.More can be found out from BrowserSyncThanks.You can try serve-meUsing it is so easy:Thats all. PD: The folder served by default is "public".For a healthy increase of performance using node to serve static resources, I recommend using Buffet. It works similar to as a web application accelerator also known as a\xc2\xa0caching\xc2\xa0HTTP reverse proxy but it just loads the chosen directory into memory. Buffet takes a fully-bufferred approach -- all files are fully loaded into memory when your app boots, so you will never feel the burn of the filesystem. In practice, this is immensely efficient. So much so that putting\xc2\xa0Varnish\xc2\xa0in front of your app might even make it slower!\xc2\xa0We use it on the codePile site and found an increase of ~700requests/sec to >4k requests/sec on a page that downloads 25 resources under a 1k concurrent user connection load.Example:Take a look on that link.You need only to install express module of node js.You can access your file like http://hostname/Folder/file.zipHere is my one-file/lightweight node.js static file web-server pet project with no-dependency that I believe is a quick and rich tool which its use is as easy as issuing this command on your Linux/Unix/macOS terminal (or termux on Android) when node.js (or nodejs-legacy on Debian/Ubuntu) is installed:(different commands exist for Windows users on the documentation)It supports different things that I believe can be found useful,The features described above are mostly documented on the main page of the tool http://pad.js.org which by some nice trick I used is also the place the tool source itself is also served from!The tool source is on GitHub which welcomes your feedback, feature requests and \xe2\xad\x90s!It isn\'t on NPM, yet, but I built a simple static server on Express that also allows you to accept form submissions and email them through a transactional email service (Sendgrid for now, Mandrill coming).https://github.com/jdr0dn3y/nodejs-StatServeHere\'s another simple web server.  https://www.npmjs.com/package/hostrInstallChange working directorAnd startFirst install node-static server via npm install node-static -g  -g is to install it global on your system, then  navigate to the directory where your files are located, start the server with static   it listens on port 8080, naviaget to the browser and type localhost:8080/yourhtmlfilename.If that\'s all you need, try this:note: You need to use "/index.html" as part of your address ie "http://localhost:3000/index.html"Searching in NPM registry https://npmjs.org/search?q=server, I have found static-server https://github.com/maelstrom/static-serverEver needed to send a colleague a file, but can\'t be bothered emailing\n  the 100MB beast? Wanted to run a simple example JavaScript\n  application, but had problems with running it through the file:///\n  protocol? Wanted to share your media directory at a LAN without\n  setting up Samba, or FTP, or anything else requiring you to edit\n  configuration files? Then this file server will make your life that\n  little bit easier.To install the simple static stuff server, use npm:Then to serve a file or a directory, simply runThat could even list folder content. Unfortunately, it couldn\'t serve files :)A simple Static-Server using connectSee also Using node.js as a simple web serverFor the benefit of searchers, I liked Jakub g\'s answer, but wanted a little error handling. Obviously it\'s best to handle errors properly, but this should help prevent a site stopping if an error occurs. Code below:For dev work you can use (express 4)\nhttps://github.com/appsmatics/simple-httpserver.gitI use Houston at work and for personal projects, it works well for me. https://github.com/alejandro/HoustonIf you are intrested in ultra-light http server without any prerequisites\nyou should have a look at: mongooseYou also asked why requests are dropping - not sure what\'s the specific reason on your case, but in overall you better server static content using dedicated middleware (nginx, S3, CDN) because Node is really not optimized for this networking pattern.
