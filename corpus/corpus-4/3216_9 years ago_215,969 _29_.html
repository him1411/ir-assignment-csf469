I want to copy the entire contents of a directory from one location to another in C#.There doesn\'t appear to be a way to do this using System.IO classes without lots of recursion.There is a method in VB that we can use if we add a reference to Microsoft.VisualBasic:This seems like a rather ugly hack. Is there a better way?Much easierHmm, I think I misunderstand the question but I\'m going to risk it. What\'s wrong with the following straightforward method?EDIT Since this posting has garnered an impressive number of downvotes for such a simple answer to an equally simple question, let me add an explanation. Please read this before downvoting.First of all, this code is not intendend as a drop-in replacement to the code in the question. It is for illustration purpose only.Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Computer.FileSystem.CopyDirectory does some additional correctness tests (e.g. whether the source and target are valid directories, whether the source is a parent of the target etc.) that are missing from this answer. That code is probably also more optimized.That said, the code works well. It has (almost identically) been used in a mature software for years. Apart from the inherent fickleness present with all IO handlings (e.g. what happens if the user manually unplugs the USB drive while your code is writing to it?), there are no known problems.In particular, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to point out that the use of recursion here is absolutely not a problem. Neither in theory (conceptually, it\xe2\x80\x99s the most elegant solution) nor in practice: this code will not overflow the stack. The stack is large enough to handle even deeply nested file hierarchies. Long before stack space becomes a problem, the folder path length limitation kicks in.Notice that a malicious user might be able to break this assumption by using deeply-nested directories of one letter each. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t tried this. But just to illustrate the point: in order to make this code overflow on a typical computer, the directories would have to be nested a few thousand times. This is simply not a realistic scenario.Copied from MSDN:Try this:Your xcopy arguments may vary but you get the idea.Or, if you want to go the hard way, add a reference to your project for Microsoft.VisualBasic and then use the following:However, using one of the recursive functions is a better way to go since it won\'t have to load the VB dll.This site always helped me a lot of, and now is my time to help the others with what i know.I wait that my code below be useful for someone.Copy folder recursively without recursion to avoid stack overflow.Here\'s a utility class I\'ve used for IO tasks like this.If you like Konrad\'s popular answer, but you want the source itself to be a folder under target, rather than putting it\'s children under the target folder, here\'s the code for that. It returns the newly created DirectoryInfo, which is handy:tboswell \'s replace Proof version (which is resilient to repeating pattern in filepath)Sorry for the previous code, it still had bugs :( (fell prey to the fastest gun problem)   . Here it is tested and working. The key is the SearchOption.AllDirectories, which eliminates the need for explicit recursion.A minor improvement on d4nt\'s answer, as you probably want to check for errors and not have to change xcopy paths if you\'re working on a server and development machine:This is my code hope this helpHere is an extension method for DirectoryInfo a la FileInfo.CopyTo (note the overwrite parameter):You can always use this, taken from Microsofts website. Use this class.
