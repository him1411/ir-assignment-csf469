I would like to get some feedback on these tools on :Well, I am a bit curious, so I just tested the 3 myself right after asking the question ;-)Ok, this is not a very serious review but here is what I can say :I tried the tools with the default settings (it\'s important because you can pretty much choose your check rules) on the following script :As a result :Strongs points :Cons :Corrected script (with lazy doc strings and variable names) :EDIT :Thanks to Rudiger Wolf, I discovered pep8 that does exactly what its name suggests: matching PEP8. It has found several syntax no-nos that PyLint did not. But PyLint found stuff that was not specifically linked to PEP8 but interesting. Both tools are interesting and complementary.Eventually I will use both since there are really easy to install (via packages or setuptools) and the output text is so easy to chain.To give you a little idea of their output:pep8:PyLint :pep8 was recently added to PyPi.It is now super easy to check your code against pep8.See http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8
