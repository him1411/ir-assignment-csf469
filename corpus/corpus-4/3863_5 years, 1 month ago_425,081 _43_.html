This is a self Q&A of a handy piece of code I came up with.Currently, there isn\'t an easy way to embed an SVG image and then have access to the SVG elements via CSS. There are various methods of using JS SVG frameworks, but they are overly complicated if all you are doing is making a simple icon with a rollover state.So here is what I came up with, which I think is by far the easiest way to use SVG files on a website. It takes its concept from the early text-to-image replacement methods, but as far as I am aware has never been done for SVGs.This is the question:Firstly, use an IMG tag in your HTML to embed an SVG graphic. I used Adobe Illustrator to make the graphic.This is just like how you\'d embed a normal image. Note that you need to set the IMG to have a class of svg. The \'social-link\' class is just for examples sake. The ID is not required, but is useful.Then use this jQuery code (in a separate file or inline in the HEAD).What the above code does is look for all IMG\'s with the class \'svg\' and replace it with the inline SVG from the linked file. The massive advantage is that it allows you to use CSS to change the color of the SVG now, like so:The jQuery code I wrote also ports across the original images ID and classes. So this CSS works too:Or:You can see an example of it working here:\nhttp://labs.funkhausdesign.com/examples/img-svg/img-to-svg.htmlWe have a more complicated version that includes caching here:\nhttps://github.com/funkhaus/style-guide/blob/master/template/js/site.js#L32-L90StyleScriptAlternatively you could use CSS mask, granted browser support isn\'t good but you could use a fallback@Drew Baker gave a great solution to solve the problem. The code works properly. However, those who uses AngularJs may find lots of dependency on jQuery. Consequently, I thought it is a good idea to paste for AngularJS users, a code following @Drew Baker\'s solution.AngularJs way of the same code 1. Html: use the bellow tag in you html file:2. Directive: this will be the directive that you will need to recognise the tag:3. CSS:4. Unit-test with karma-jasmine:If you can include files (PHP include or include via your CMS of choice) in your page, you can add the SVG code and include it into your page. This works the same as pasting the SVG source into the page, but makes the page markup cleaner.The benefit is that you can target parts of your SVG via CSS for hover -- no javascript required.http://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/evcBuYou just have to use a CSS rule like this:Note that the !important bit is necessary to override the fill color.You can now use the CSS filter property in most modern browsers (including Edge, but not IE11). It works on SVG images as well as other elements. You can use hue-rotate or invert to modify colors, although they don\'t let you modify different colors independently. I use the following CSS class to show a "disabled" version of an icon (where the original is an SVG picture with saturated color):This makes it light grey in most browsers. In IE (and probably Opera Mini, which I haven\'t tested) it is noticeably faded by the opacity property, which still looks pretty good, although it\'s not grey.Here\'s an example with four different CSS classes for the Twemoji bell icon: original (yellow), the above "disabled" class, hue-rotate (green), and invert (blue).I wrote a directive to solve this issue with AngularJS. It is available here - ngReusableSvg.It replaces the SVG element after it\'s been rendered, and places it inside a div element, making its CSS easily changeable. This helps using the same SVG file in different places using different sizes/colors.The usage is simple:After that, you can easily have:If we have a greater number of such svg images we can also take the help of font-files.\nSites like https://glyphter.com/ can get us a font file from our svgs.E.g.Here\'s a version for knockout.js based on the accepted answer:Important: It does actually require jQuery too for the replacing, but I thought it may be useful to some.Then just apply data-bind="svgConvert: true" to your img tag.This solution completely replaces the img tag with a SVG and any additional bindings would not be respected.The selected solution is fine if you want jQuery to process all svg elements in your DOM and your DOM is of reasonable size. But if your DOM is large and you decide to load parts of your DOM dynamically, it really makes no sense to have to rescan the entire DOM just to update svg elements. Instead, use a jQuery plugin to do this:In your html, specify an svg element as follows:And apply the plugin:
