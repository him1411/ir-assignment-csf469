I am working on a function to download an image from a web server, display it on the screen, and if the user wishes to keep the image, save it on the SD card in a certain folder. Is there an easy way to take a bitmap and just save it to the SD card in a folder of my choice?My issue is that I can download the image, display it on screen as a Bitmap. The only way I have been able to find to save an image to a particular folder is to use FileOutputStream, but that requires a byte array. I am not sure how to convert (if this is even the right way) from Bitmap to byte array, so I can use a FileOutputStream to write the data.The other option I have is to use MediaStore :Which works fine to save to SD card, but does not allow you to customize the folder.You should use the Bitmap.compress() method to save a Bitmap as a file. It will compress (if the format used allows it) your picture and push it into an OutputStream.Here is an example of a Bitmap instance obtained through getImageBitmap(myurl) that can be compressed as a JPEG with a compression rate of 85% :will throw exception without permission in AndroidManifest.xml (at least in os2.2):Inside onActivityResult:Some formats, like PNG which is lossless, will ignore the quality setting.Why not call the Bitmap.compress method with 100 (which sounds like it is lossless)?I would also like to save a picture. But my problem(?) is that I want to save it from a bitmap that ive drawed. I made it like this:The way I found to send PNG and transparency.Here is the sample code for saving bitmap to file :Now call this function to save the bitmap to internal memory.File newfile = savebitmap(bitmap);I hope it will help you.\nHappy codeing life. Hey just give the name to .bmpDo this:it\'ll sound that IM JUST FOOLING AROUND  but try it once it\'ll get saved in bmp foramt..CheersMake sure the directory is created before you call bitmap.compress: Not actually an answer, but a comment. I am on a Mac running the emulator environment, and get a java.io.IOException: Permission denied - error with this code:I also added the uses-permission android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to the manifest file (as noted by others). // |==| Create a PNG File from Bitmap :// |==| Get Bimap from File :After Android 4.4 Kitkat, and as of 2017 share of Android 4.4 and less is about 20% and decreasing, it\'s not possible to save to SD card using File class and getExternalStorageDirectory() method. This method returns your device internal memory and images save visible to every app. You can also save images only private to your app and to be deleted when user deletes your app with openFileOutput() method. Starting with Android 6.0, you can format your SD card as an internal memory but only private to your device.(If you format SD car as internal memory, only your device can access or see it\'s contents) You can save to that SD card using other answers but if you want to use a removable SD card you should read my answer below.You should use Storage Access Framework to get uri to folder onActivityResult method of activity to get folder selected by user, and add retreive persistiable permission to be able to access folder after user restarts the device.Now, save save folder to shared preferences not to ask user to select folder every time you want to save an image.You should use DocumentFile class to save your image, not File or ParcelFileDescriptor, for more info you can check this thread for saving image to SD card with compress(CompressFormat.JPEG, 100, out); method and DocumentFile classes.
