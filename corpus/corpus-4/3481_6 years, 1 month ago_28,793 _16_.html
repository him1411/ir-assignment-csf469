I sort of want the equivalent of cd - for git. If I am in branch master and I checkout foo, I would love to be able to type something like git checkout - to go back to master, and be able to type it again to return to foo.Does anything like this exist? Would it be hard to implement?From the release notes for 1.6.2@{-1} is a way to refer to the last branch you were on.  This is\n  accepted not only where an object name is expected, but anywhere a\n  branch name is expected and acts as if you typed the branch name.\n  E.g. git branch --track mybranch @{-1}, git merge @{-1}, and\n  git rev-parse --symbolic-full-name @{-1} would work as expected.andgit checkout - is a shorthand for git checkout @{-1}.The simplest way of doing this nowadays is:... which is an alias of:If you want to know more about this, I wrote an entire article about it here: Checkout The Previous Branch In Git.As @Karl points out and from git checkout manual:As a special case, the "@{-N}" syntax for the N-th last branch checks\n  out the branch (instead of detaching). You may also specify - which is\n  synonymous with "@{-1}".So both git checkout - and git checkout @{-1} would work in this caseClosest I believe is using the git reflog and parse the latest moving from branch1 to branch2 and git checkout branch1Just adding some more detail to the previous answers to understand the mechanism by which git checkout @{-N} works.  It walks the reflog to inspect the checkout history, so if you wanted to implement something similar on your own you should be able to parse the output of git reflog looking for checkout: lines.  You can check the implementation in the git source sha1_name.c, specifically the function interpret_nth_prior_checkout.I landed to this question with the same thought to checkout my previous branch.
