Possible Duplicate:\n  Any way to delete in vim without overwriting your last yank? Using Vim I often want to replace a block of code with a block that I just yanked.But when I delete the block of code that is to be replaced, that block itself goes into the register which erases the block I just yanked. So I\'ve got in the habit of yanking, then inserting, then deleting what I didn\'t want, but with large blocks of code this gets messy trying to keep the inserted block and the block to delete separate.So what is the slickest and quickest way to replace text in Vim?To delete something without saving it in a register, you can use the "black hole register":Of course you could also use any of the other registers that don\'t hold anything you are interested in.Yep. It\'s slightly more convoluted than deleting the "old" text first, but:I start off with..I shift+v select the line1, line 2, 3 and 4, and delete them with the d commandThen I delete the old 1-4 lines the same way.Then, doThat\'ll paste the second-last yanked lines (line 1-4). "3p will do the third-from-last, and so on..So I end up withReference:\nVim documentation on numbered registerVIM docs: Numbered register 0 contains the text from the most recent yank command,\nunless the command specified another register with ["x].E.g. we yank "foo" and delete "bar" - the registry 0 still contains "foo"! Hence "foo" can be pasted using "0pIt\'s handy to have an easy mapping which lets you replace the current selection with buffer.For example when you put this in your .vimrcthen, after copying something into register (i.e. with \'y\'), you can just select the text which you want to be replaced, and simply hit \'r\' on your keyboard. The selection will be substituted with your current register.Explanation:I put the following in my vimrc:Now I yank to and put from the clipboard register, and don\'t have to care what happens with the default register. An added benefit is that I can paste from other apps with minimal hassle. I\'m losing some functionality, I know, but I just can\'t keep track of more than one register/clipboard anyway.For the specific example that you gave, if I understand the question then this might work:To emphasize what EBGreen said:If you paste while selecting text, the selected text is replaced with the pasted text.If you want to copy some text and then paste it in multiple locations, use "0p to paste. Numbered register 0 contains the text from the most recent yank command.Also, you can list the contents of all of your registers:That command makes it easier to figure out what register you want when doing something like dbr\'s answer. You\'ll also see the /,%,# registers. (See also :help registers)And finally, check out cW and cW to change a word including and not including an trailing space. (Using capital W includes punctuation.)All yank and delete operations write to the unnamed register by default. However, the most recent yank and most recent delete are always stored (separately) in the numbered registers. The register 0 holds the most recent yank. The registers 1-9 hold the 9 most recent deletes (with 1 being the most recent). In other words, a delete overwrites the most recent yank in the unnamed register, but it\'s still there in the 0 register. The blackhole-register trick ("_dd) mentioned in the other answers works because it prevents overwriting the unnamed register, but it\'s not necessary.You reference a register using double quotes, so pasting the most recently yanked text can be done like this:This is an excellent reference:For \'replace word\', try cw in normal mode.For \'replace paragraph\', try cap in normal mode.If you\'re using Vim then you\'ll have the visual mode, which is like selecting, but with the separating modes thing that\'s the basis of vi/vim.What you want to do is use visual mode to select the source, then yank, then use visual mode again to select the scope of the destination, and then paste to text from the default buffer.Example:In a text file with:with the following sequence: ggVjyGVkp you\'ll end with:Explained:This has the little inconvenient that puts the last block on the buffer, so it\'s somehow not desired for repeated pastings of the same thing, so you\'ll want to save the source to a named buffer with something like "ay (to a buffer called "a") and paste with something like "ap (but then if you\'re programming, you probably don\'t want to paste several times but to create a function and call it, right? RIGHT?).If you are only using vi, then youll have to use invisible marks instead the visual mode, :he mark for more on this, I\'m sorry but I\'m not very good with this invisible marks thing, I\'m pretty contaminated with visual mode.A minimal invasive solution for the lazy ones:Register 0 always contains the last yank (as Rafael, alex2k8 and idbrii have already mentioned). Unfortunately selecting register 0 all the time can be quite annoying, so it would be nice if p uses "0 by default. This can be achieved by putting the following lines into your .vimrc:The first line maps each p stroke to "0p. However, this prevents p from accessing any other registers. Therefore all p strokes with an explicitly selected register are mapped to the equivalent commandline expression within the for-loop. The same is done for P.This way the standard behaviour is preserved, except for the implicit p and P strokes, which now use register 0 by default.Hint 1: The cut command is now "0d instead of just d. But since I\'m lazy  this is way too long for me ;) Therefore I\'m using the following mapping:The leader key is \\ by default, so you can easily cut text by typing \\d or \\D.Hint 2: The default timeout for multi-key mappings is pretty short. You might want to increase it to have more time when selecting a register. See :help timeoutlen for details, I\'m using:Well, first do this command:Then you will realize that you can delete into a specific register. That way you won\'t alter what is in your default register.Text deleted, while in insert mode, doesn\'t go into default register.The two solutions I use in the right contexts are;I use this mostly out of habit as I only found the second solution much later, eg Basically you go about pasting as you would, but when you realise that you have since overwritten the default register thus losing what you actually wanted to paste you can <C-P> to find and replace from the YankRing history!One of those must have plugins...In the windows version (probably in Linux also), you can yank into the system\'s copy/paste buffer using "*y (i.e. preceding your yank command with double-quotes and asterisk).You can then delete the replaceable lines normally and paste the copied text using "*p.I often make a mistake when following the commands to \'y\'ank then \'"_d\'elete into a black hole then \'p\'aste. I prefer to \'y\'ank, then delete however I like, then \'"0p\' from the 0 register, which is where the last copied text gets pushed to.I found a very useful mapping for your purpose:Deleted text is put in "black hole register", and the yanked text remains. Source: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Replace_a_word_with_yanked_textFor Dvorak users, one very convenient method is to just delete unneeded text into the "1 register instead of the "_ black hole register, if only because you can press " + 1 with the same shift press and a swift pinky motion since 1 is the key immediately above " in Dvorak (PLUS d is in the other hand, which makes the whole command fast as hell).Then of course, the "1 register could be used for other things because of it\'s convenience, but unless you have a purpose more common than replacing text I\'d say it\'s a pretty good use of the register.
