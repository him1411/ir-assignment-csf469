I have two branches:Recently I seriously messed up my local branch (guess every git-newbie has been on my place at some point of time)How would I replace the local branch entirely with the remote one, so I can continue my work from where the remote branch is now?(I already searched SO and checking out to the remote branch locally does not have any effect)Simply:Assuming that "origin/master" is your remote branch you want to reset to. This updates your local HEAD branch to be the same revision as origin/master, and --hard will sync this change into the index and workspace as well.That\'s as easy as three steps:  You can do as @Hugo of @Laurent said, or you can use git rebase to delete the commits you want to get rid off, if you know which ones. I tend to use git rebase -i head~N (where N is a number, allowing you to manipulate the last N commits) for this kind of operations.The selected answer is absolutely correct, however it did not leave me with the latest commit/pushes ...So for me: Since I know I want to temporarily set my upstream branch for a few weeks to a specific branch ( same as the one i switched to / checked out earlier and did a hard reset on ) So AFTER resetReplace everything with the remote branch; but, only from the same commit your local branch is on:OR, get the latest from the remote branch and replace everything:As an aside, if needed, you can wipe out untracked files & directories that you haven\'t committed yet:The safest and most complete way to replace the current local branch with the remote:The stash line saves the changes that you have not committed. The branch line moves your branch to a different name, freeing up the original name. The fetch line retrieves the latest copy of the remote. The checkout line recreates the original branch as a tracking branch.Or as a bash function:which renames the current branch to something like replaced_master_98d258f.If you want to update branch that is not currently checked out you can doAs provided in chosen explanation, git reset is good.\nBut nowadays we often use sub-modules: repositories inside repositories. For example, you if you use ZF3 and jQuery in your project you most probably want them to be cloned from their original repositories.\nIn such case git reset is not enough.\nWe need to update submodules to that exact version that are defined in our repository:it is the same as you will come (cd) recursively to the working directory of each sub-module and will run:And it\'s very different from because sub-modules point not to branch but to the commit.In that cases when you manually checkout some branch for 1 or more submodules\nyou can runThe ugly but simpler way: delete your local folder, and clone the remote repository again.
