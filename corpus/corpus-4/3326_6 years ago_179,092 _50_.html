I am having this issue where I am using the Android\'s Holo theme on a tablet project. However, I have a fragment on screen which has a white background. I am adding an EditText component on this fragment. I\'ve tried to override the theme by setting the background of the Holo.Light theme resources. However, my text cursor (carat) remains white and hence, invisible on screen (I can spot it faintly in the edittext field..).Does anyone know how I can get EditText to use a darker cursor color? I\'ve tried setting the style of the EditText to "@android:style/Widget.Holo.Light.EditText" with no positive result.Setting the android:textCursorDrawable attribute to @null should result in the use of android:textColor as the cursor color.Attribute "textCursorDrawable" is available in API level 12 and higher In Layout Then create drawalble xml: color_cursorYou have a white color cursor on EditText property. It appears as if all the answers go around the bushes.In your EditText, use the property: and add the drawable black_cursor.xml to your resources, as follows:This is also the way to create more diverse cursors, if you need.I found the answer :)I\'ve set the Theme\'s editText style to:Then I\'ve used the following drawable to set the cursor:``android:textCursorDrawable is the key here.There is a new way to change cursor color in latest Appcompact v21\nJust change colorAccent in style like this:Then apply this style on your app theme or activities.Update: this way only works on API 21+  \nUpdate 2: I\'m not sure the minimum android version that it can work. Tested by android version:For anyone that needs to set the EditText cursor color dynamically, below you will find two ways to achieve this.First, create your cursor drawable:Set the cursor drawable resource id to the drawable you created (https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/kitkat-release/core/java/android/widget/TextView.java#L562-564">source)):To just change the color of the default cursor drawable, you can use the following method:Late to the party,Here\'s is my answer, This is for the people who are not looking to change the colorAccent in their parent theme,but wants to change EditText attributes!This answer demos how to change ......Example:Now create a drawable(edit_text_background) add a resource xml for the background!You can customize as you want!Now as you did set this style in your Activity theme.Example : In your Activity you have a theme,set this custom editText theme to that.Then create drawalble xml: color_cursorFor me I modified both the AppTheme and a value colors.xmlHere is the colors.xmlI took out the android:textCursorDrawable attribute to @null that I placed inside the editText style. When I tried using this, the colors would not change. editcolor.xml android:textCursorDrawable="@drawable/editcolor"In xml file set color code of edittext background colorWow I am real late to this party but it has had activity 17 days ago\nIt would seam we need to consider posting what version of Android we are using for an answer so as of now this answer works with Android 2.1 and above \nGo to RES/VALUES/STYLES and add the lines of code below and your cursor will be blackYou will need a this line of code in your RES/COLOR folder Why post this late ? It might be nice to consider some form of categories for the many headed monster Android has become! Its even easier than that.  This works in ICS and beyond. I haven\'t tested it in other versions.change t he color of colorAccent in styles.xm, that\'s it simpleuse thisandroid:textCursorDrawable="@color/white"
