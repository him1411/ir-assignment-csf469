I needed to write a script to enter multi-line input to a program (psql).After a bit of googling, I found the following syntax works:This correctly constructs the multi-line string (from BEGIN; to END;, inclusive) and pipes it as an input to psql.But I have no idea how/why it works, can some one please explain?I\'m referring mainly to cat << EOF, I know > outputs to a file, >> appends to a file, < reads input from file. What does << exactly do?And is there a man page for it?This is called heredoc format to provide a string into stdin. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document#Unix_shells for more details.From man bash:This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from\n  the current source until a line\n  containing only word (with no trailing\n  blanks)  is  seen.All of the lines read up to that point are then used as the\n  standard input for a command.The format of here-documents is:No parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or\n  pathname expansion is performed on\n  word.  If any characters in word are\n  quoted, the\n  delimiter is the result of quote removal on word, and the lines\n  in the here-document are not expanded.\n  If word is unquoted, all lines of  the\n  here-document  are  subjected  to  parameter  expansion,  command\n  substitution, and arithmetic\n  expansion.  In the latter case, the\n  character sequence \\<newline> is\n  ignored, and \\ must be used to quote the characters \\, $, and `.If the redirection operator is <<-, then all leading tab characters\n  are stripped from input lines and the\n  line containing delimiter.   This \n  allows  here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a natural fashion.The cat <<EOF syntax is very useful when working with multi-line text in Bash, eg. when assigning multi-line string to a shell variable, file or a pipe.The $sql variable now holds the new-line characters too. You can verify with echo -e "$sql".The print.sh file now contains:The b.txt file contains bar and baz lines. The same output is printed to stdout.In your case, "EOF" is known as a "Here Tag". Basically <<Here tells the shell that you are going to enter a multiline string until the "tag" Here. You can name this tag as you want, it\'s often EOF or STOP.Some rules about the Here tags:example: kennytm quoted man bash, but most of that is also POSIX 7: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_07_04 :The redirection operators "<<" and "<<-" both allow redirection of lines contained in a shell input file, known as a "here-document", to the input of a command.The here-document shall be treated as a single word that begins after the next  and continues until there is a line containing only the delimiter and a , with no  characters in between. Then the next here-document starts, if there is one. The format is as follows:where the optional n represents the file descriptor number. If the number is omitted, the here-document refers to standard input (file descriptor 0).If any character in word is quoted, the delimiter shall be formed by performing quote removal on word, and the here-document lines shall not be expanded. Otherwise, the delimiter shall be the word itself.If no characters in word are quoted, all lines of the here-document shall be expanded for parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. In this case, the  in the input behaves as the  inside double-quotes (see Double-Quotes). However, the double-quote character ( \'"\' ) shall not be treated specially within a here-document, except when the double-quote appears within "$()", "``", or "${}".If the redirection symbol is "<<-", all leading <tab> characters shall be stripped from input lines and the line containing the trailing delimiter. If more than one "<<" or "<<-" operator is specified on a line, the here-document associated with the first operator shall be supplied first by the application and shall be read first by the shell.When a here-document is read from a terminal device and the shell is interactive, it shall write the contents of the variable PS2, processed as described in Shell Variables, to standard error before reading each line of input until the delimiter has been recognized.Some examples not yet given.Without quotes:Output:With quotes:or (ugly but valid):Outputs:Without hyphen:where <tab> is a literal tab, and can be inserted with Ctrl + V <tab>Output:With hyphen:Output:This exists of course so that you can indent your cat like the surrounding code, which is easier to read and maintain. E.g.: Unfortunately, this does not work for space characters: POSIX favored tab indentation here. Yikes.Using tee instead of catNot exactly as an answer to the original question, but I wanted to share this anyway: I had the need to create a config file in a directory that required root rights.The following does not work for that case:because the redirection is handled outside of the sudo context.I ended up using this instead:
