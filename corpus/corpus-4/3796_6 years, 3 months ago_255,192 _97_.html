How do I run Redis on Windows? The Redis download page just seems to offer *nix options.Can I run Redis natively on Windows?One click Redis install as a Windows service:https://github.com/rgl/redis/downloadsDownload and run the top .exe (ignore the "download as zip" button)Edit: For the latest versions of Redis for Windows look at MSOpenTech/redis. See Todd Menier\'s answer for more information.If you want to install MSOpenTech\'s latest port of Redis, on a Windows server, watched over by a Windows Service, without having to build anything yourself, read on.MSOpenTech\'s seems to be the only port that is actively trying to keep up with the latest and greatest Redis. They claim it is production-ready, but they haven\'t exactly packaged it up neatly for installation on a server, especially if you want to run their RedisWatcher service to keep an eye on it, which is recommended. (I tried building RedisWatcher myself per their instructions, but the required Wix Toolset managed to mess up my system pretty good. I won\'t go into it.) Fortunately they\'ve provided all the binaries you need, just not all in one place. From the README:So far the RedisWatcher is not carried over to 2.6. However this\n  should not be affected by the Redis version, and the code in the 2.4\n  branch should work with the Redis 2.6 binaries.So you\'ll need to download binaries from 2 branches in order to get all the necessary bits. Without further ado, here are the steps:I found one more simple way to install Redis under WindowsDownload the latest Redis .msi file from https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releasesafter installation. The redis service is installed, we can operate it from Service managerThe most updated (only few minor releases behind) version of Redis can be found here. This repository provides you with 3.2.100 version (current is 3.2) whereas the most upvoted answer gives you only 2.4.6 version and the last update to the repo was 2 years ago.The installation is straightforward: just copy everything from the archive to any folder and run redis-server.exe to run the server and redis-cli.exe to connect to this server through the shell.To install Redis for Windows You can choose either from these sourcesPersonally I prepared the first optionExtract the zip to prepared directoryrun redis-server.exeYou can start using Redis now please refer for commandsGo to the releases and you can get a ZIP file containing the relevant files as well as a Word document called RedisService.docx with the following instructions:Installing the Service--service-installThis must be the first argument on the redis-server command line. Arguments after this are passed in the order they occur to Redis when the service is launched. The service will be configured as Autostart and will be launched as "NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService". Upon successful installation a success message will be displayed and Redis will exit.\n  This command does not start the service.For instance:redis-server --service-install redis.windows.conf --loglevel verboseAnd then later, in the same document, another example:The following would install and start three separate instances of Redis as a service:redis-server --service-install -\xe2\x80\x93service-name redisService1 \xe2\x80\x93port 10001redis-server --service-start --service-name redisService1redis-server --service-install --service-name redisService2 \xe2\x80\x93port 10002redis-server --service-start --service-name redisService2redis-server --service-install --service-name redisService3 \xe2\x80\x93port 10003redis-server --service-start --service-name redisService3From what I can gather, this appears to be the new way forward rather than messing with a separate Windows service to monitor and restart the CLI.Download redis from \nDownload Redis for windowsThats it.MS Open Tech recently made a version of Redis available for download on Github.  They say that it isn\'t production ready yet, but keep an eye on it.Github repoI don\'t run redis on windows. There\'s too much hassle involved in keeping up with the ports, and they lag behind redis-stable by a version or two all the time.Instead I run redis on a Vagrant virtual machine that runs redis for me. I\'ve bundled up the whole thing into a simple github repo so everyone can get in on the fun without too much hassle. The whole thing is an automated build so there\'s no mess. I blogged about the details here.I think these is the two most simple ways to run Redis on WindowsAs described here:wget\n  https://raw.github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows/master/downloads/redis64-latest.zip Extract redis64-latest.zip in any folder, e.g. in c:\\redisRun the redis-server.exe using the local configurationcd c:\\redis redis-server.exe redis.confcd c:\\redis redis-cli.exeYou can use Redis on Windows with Vagrant, as described here:Install Vagrant on WindowsDownload the vagrant-redis.zip vagrant configurationwget https://raw.github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows/master/downloads/vagrant-redis.zipExtract vagrant-redis.zip in any folder, e.g. in c:\\vagrant-redisLaunch the Virtual Box VM with vagrant up:cd c:\\vagrant-redisvagrant upThis will launch a new Ubuntu VM instance inside Virtual Box that will\n  automatically install and start the latest stable version of redis.Maybe its a little Late but, I was able to run Redis on Windows 10 Aniversary Update.\nWindows 10 Aniversary Update Comes with Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, simply, it comes with bash.\nBelow are the two tutorial that I followed: \n1- How to Install and Use the Linux Bash Shell on Windows 10\n2- How To Install and Use Redis\nBelow is the image of running Redis.\nEnjoy :)\nThe Redis download page now has links to some unofficial Windows ports.

Virtualization toll is quite high because for many common operations. (...) Prefer to run Redis on a physical box, especially if you favor deterministic latencies. On a state-of-the-art hypervisor (VMWare), result of redis-benchmark on a VM through the physical network is almost divided by 2 compared to the physical machine, with some significant CPU time spent in system and interruptions.You can try out baboonstack, which includes redis and also a node.js and mongoDB version manager. And it\'s cross platform.It seems this is the easiest way to get the latest version of Redis - use NuGet Manager:1) Open NuGet setup page  and download Command-Line Utility\n(The latest version of the nuget.exe command-line tool is always available from https://nuget.org/nuget.exe)2) Copy this file to somewhere (for example, C:\\Downloads)3) Start a command prompt as an Administrator and execute follow commands:4) In the Downloads folder will be the latest version of Redis (C:\\Downloads\\Redis-64.2.8.19 in my case)5) Run redis-server.exe and start workingP.S.
