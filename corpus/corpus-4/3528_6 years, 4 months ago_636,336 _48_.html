How can I check for null values in JavaScript? I wrote the code below but it didn\'t work.And how can I find errors in my JavaScript programs?Javascript is very flexible with regards to checking for "null" values.  I\'m guessing you\'re actually looking for empty strings, in which case this simpler code will work:Which will check for empty strings (""), null, undefined, false and the numbers 0 and NaNPlease note that if you are specifically checking for numbers it is a common mistake to miss 0 with this method, and num !== 0 is preferred (or num !== -1 or ~num (hacky code that also checks against -1)) for functions that return -1, e.g. indexOf)To check for null SPECIFICALLY you would use this:...or more simply:This test will ONLY pass for null and will not pass for "", undefined, false, 0, or NaN.The rest of this is in response to inorganik\'s comment, Yes, you can check each one individually.You need to implement use of the absolutely equals: === and typeof to be absolutely sure with your checks.I\'ve created a JSFiddle here to show all of the individual tests workingHere is all of the output of the tests:As you can see, it\'s a little more difficult to test against NaN;just replace the == with === in all places.== is a loose or abstract equality comparison=== is a strict equality comparisonSee the MDN article on Equality comparisons and sameness for more detail.Strict equality operator:-We can check null by === Just by using ifwill evaluate to true if value is not:Firstly, you have a return statement without a function body. Chances are that that will throw an error.A cleaner way to do your check would be to simply use the ! operator:you can use try catch finallyyou can also throw your own errors. See this.to check for undefined and null in javascript you need just to write the following :This is a comment on WebWanderer\'s solution regarding checking for NaN (I don\'t have enough rep yet to leave a formal comment).  The solution reads as but this will fail for rational numbers which would round to 0, such as variable = 0.1.  A better test would be:In JavaScript, no string is equal to null.Maybe you expected pass == null to be true when pass is an empty string because you\'re aware that the loose equality operator == performs certain kinds of type coercion.For example, this expression is true:In contrast, the strict equality operator === says that this is false:Given that \'\' and 0 are loosely equal, you might reasonably conjecture that \'\' and null are loosely equal. However, they are not.This expression is false:The result of comparing any string to null is false. Therefore, pass == null and all your other tests are always false, and the user never gets the alert.To fix your code, compare each value to the empty string:If you\'re certain that pass is a string, pass == \'\' will also work because only an empty string is loosely equal to the empty string. On the other hand, some experts say that it\'s a good practice to always use strict equality in JavaScript unless you specifically want to do the type coercion that the loose equality operator performs.If you want to know what pairs of values are loosely equal, see the table "Sameness comparisons" in the Mozilla article on this topic.underscore: _.isNulljQuery: jQuery.typeTension Free Solutionuse jquery to check if object is Empty. then you can Negate it by Just adding !$.isEmptyObject(data[i].geo)This will not work in case of Boolean values coming from DB\nfor ex:Try this:You can also use this reusable is-nil open source component which determines whether val reference is null or undefined and returns a boolean.Examples:It will return false even if given an empty string for example.
