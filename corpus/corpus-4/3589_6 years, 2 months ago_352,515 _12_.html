I want to use JavaScript (or jQuery) to do some client-side validation to check whether a string matches the regex:Ideally it would be an expression that returned true or false. I\'m a JavaScript newbie, does match() do what I need? It seems to check whether part of a string matches a regex, not the whole thing. Use regex.test() if all you want is a boolean result:...and you could remove the () from your regexp since you\'ve no need for a capture.Use test() method : You can use match() as well:But test() seems to be faster as you can read here.Important difference between match() and test():match() works only with strings, but test() works also with integers.Use /youregexp/.test(yourString) if you only want to know whether your string matches the regexp.Here\'s an example that looks for certain HTML tags so it\'s clear that /someregex/.test() returns a boolean:
