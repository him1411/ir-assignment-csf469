How to add margin top to class="row" elements using twitter bootstrap framework?Editing or overriding the row in Twitter bootstrap is a bad idea, because this is a core part of the page scaffolding and you will need rows without a top margin.  To solve this, instead create a new class "top-buffer" that adds the standard margin that you need.And then use it on the row divs where you need a top margin.Ok just to let you know what\'s happened then, i fixed using some new classes as Acyra says above:whenever i want i do <div class="row top7"></div>for better responsive you can add margin-top:7% instead of 5px for example :DSometimes margin-top can causes design problems:http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-marginsSo, i recommend create "margin-bottom classes" instead of "margin-top classes" and apply them to the previous item.If you are using Bootstrap importing LESS Bootstrap files try to define the margin-bottom classes with proportional Bootstrap Theme spaces:I added these classes to my bootstrap stylesheetExampleI\'m using these classes to alter top margin:When I need an element to have 2em spacing from the element above I use it like this:If you prefere pixels so change the em to px to have it your way.If you need to separate rows in bootstrap, you can simply use .form-group. This adds 15px  margin to the bottom of row.In your case, to get margin top, you can add this class to previous .row elementFor Bootstrap 4 spacing should be applied using shorthand classesin the following format:{property}{sides}-{size}So you should be doing:Source: https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/utilities/spacing/You can use the following class for bootstrap 4:mt-0\nmt-1\nmt-2\nmt-3\nmt-4\n...Ref: https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/utilities/spacing/Add to this class in the .css file:or make a new class and add it to the elementBootstrap 4 alpha, for margin-top: shorthand CSS class names mt-1, mt-2 ( mt-lg-5, mt-sm-2) \nsame for the bottom, right, left, and you have also auto class ml-autoUnites is from 1 to 5 :  in the variables.scss \nwhich means if you set mt-1 it gives .25rem of margin top. read-more here https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/utilities/spacing/#horizontal-centeringIf you want to change just on one page, add the following style rule:In Bootstrap 4 alpha+ you can use this The classes are named using the format: {property}-{sides}-{size}Bootstrap3CSS (gutter only, without margins around):CSS (equal margins around, 15px/2):Usage:(with SASS or LESS 15px could be a variable from bootstrap)My trick. Not so clean, but works well for metry not to override the existing classes. its better to create a new class that has your desired properties.To solve this, instead create a new class "top-margin" that adds the standard margin that you need.And then use it on the row divs where you need a top margin.using a framework is a good practice. but dont forget the basics. you sould not be 100% dependent on any fameworks.
