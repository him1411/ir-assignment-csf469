Is there a way to see what would be pushed if I did a git push command?What I\'m picturing is something like the "Files Changed" tab of Github\'s "pull request" feature. When I issue a pull request, I can look and see what will be pulled in if they accept my pull request: Command line is OK, but I\'d prefer some sort of GUI (like the screenshot above).For a list of files to be pushed, run:example: For the code diff of the files to be pushed, run:To see full file paths of the files that will change, run:If you want to see these diffs in a GUI, you will need to configure git for that. See How do I view 'git diff' output with a visual diff program?.There is always dry-run:It will do everything except for the actually sending of the data. If you want a more graphical view you have a bunch of options.Tig and the gitk script that come with git both display the current branch of your local copy and the branch of the remote or origin.So any commits you make that are after the origin are the commits that will be pushed.Open gitk from shell while in the branch you want to push by typing gitk&, then to see the difference between what is on the remote and what you are about to push to the remote, select your local unpushed commit and right-click on the remote and choose "Diff this -> selected":\nTo simply list the commits waiting to be pushed:\n(this is the one you will remember)Show the commit subjects next to the SHA1s.You probably want to run git difftool origin/master....  that should show the unified diff of what is on your current branch that is not on the origin/master branch yet and display it in the graphical diff tool of your choice.  To be most up-to-date, run git fetch first.One way to compare your local version before pushing it on the remote repo (kind of push in dry-run):Use TortoiseGit:\nRight click on the root folder project > TortoiseGit > Diff with previous version >\nfor Version 2 choose refs/remotes/origin/masterTry git diff origin/master..master (assuming that origin/master is your upstream).  Unlike git push --dry-run, this still works even if you don\'t have write permission to the upstream.Use git gui, there you can see a list of what changed in your actual commit. You can also use gitk wich provides an easy interface for reflogs. Just compare between remotes/... and master to see, what will be pushed. It provides an interface similar to your screenshot.Both programs are included in git.If you are using Mac OS X, I would recommend you get Tower, it\'s a wonderful program that has made dealing with Git a pleasure for me. I now longer have to remember terminal commands and it offers a great GUI to view, track and solve differences in files. And no, I\'m not affiliated with them, I just use their software and really like it. http://www.git-tower.com/To see which files are changed and view the actual code changes compared to the master branch you could use:You can list the commits by: And then compare with the following command where the number of ^ equals to the number of commits (in the example its 2 commits):
