In Python, how do I get a function name as a string without calling the function?should output "my_function".Is this available in python? If not, any idea how to write get_function_name_as_string in Python?Using __name__ is the preferred method as it applies uniformly. Unlike func_name, it works on built-in functions as well:Also the double underscores indicate to the reader this is a special attribute. As a bonus, classes and modules have a __name__ attribute too, so you only have remember one special name.You could also useThere are also other fun properties of functions. Type dir(func_name) to list them. func_name.func_code.co_code is the compiled function, stored as a string.will display the code in almost human readable format. :)This function will return the caller\'s function name.It is like Albert Vonpupp\'s answer with a friendly wrapper.sys._getframe() is not guaranteed to be available in all implementations of Python (see ref) ,you can use the traceback module to do the same thing, eg.A call to stack[-1] will return the current process details.As an extension of @Demyn\'s answer, I created some utility functions which print the current function\'s name and current function\'s arguments:I  like using a function decorator.\nI added a class, which also times the function time. Assume gLog is a standard python logger:so now all you have to do with your function is decorate it and voila
