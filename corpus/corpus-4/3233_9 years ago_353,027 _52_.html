So I\'m working on an exceedingly large codebase, and recently upgraded to gcc 4.3, which now triggers this warning:warning: deprecated conversion from string constant to \xe2\x80\x98char*\xe2\x80\x99Obviously, the correct way to fix this is to find every declaration likeor function call like:and make them const char pointers.  However, that would mean touching 564 files, minimum, which is not a task I wish to perform at this point in time.  The problem right now is that I\'m running with -werror, so I need some way to stifle these warnings.  How can I do that?I believe passing -Wno-write-strings to gcc will suppress this warning.Any functions into which you pass string literals "I am a string literal" should use char const * as the type instead of char*.If you\'re going to fix something, fix it right.Example:Check out gcc\'s Diagnostic Pragma support, and the list of -W warning options (changed: new link to warning options).For gcc, you can use #pragma warning directives like explained here.I had a similar problem, I solved it like this:Is this an appropriate way of solving this? I do not have access to foo to adapt it to accept const char*, although that would be a better solution (because foo does not change m).If it\'s an active code base, you might still want to upgrade the code base. Of course, performing the changes manually isn\'t feasible but I believe that this problem could be solved once and for all by one single sed command. I haven\'t tried it, though, so take the following with a grain of salt.This might not find all places (even not considering function calls) but it would alleviate the problem and make it possible to perform the few remaining changes manually.I can\'t use the compiler switch. So I have turned this:to this:Here is how to do it inline in a file, so you don\'t have to modify your Makefile.You can then later...Replacewithor if you are calling in function:replace this withInstead of:This works:In C++, use the const_cast as like belowTest string is const string. So you can solve like this:or:Why not just use type casting?Do typecasting from constant string to char pointer i.e.You can also create a writable string from a string constant by calling strdup().For instance, this code generates a warning:However, the following code does not (it makes a copy of the string on the heap before passing it to putenv):In this case (and perhaps in most others) turning off the warning is a bad idea -- it\'s there for a reason.  The other alternative (making all strings writable by default) is potentially inefficient.Listen to what the compiler is telling you!   see this situation:watch the name field, in gcc it compile without warning, but in g++ it will, i don\'t know why.Why don\'t you use the -Wno-deprecated option to ignore deprecated warning messages?just use -w option for g++example:g++ -w -o simple.o simple.cpp -lpthreadRemember this doesn\'t avoid deprecation rather it prevents showing warning message on the terminal.Now if you really want to avoid deprecation use const keyword like this:BlackShift\'s answer is very helpful, and I used it like:The problem right now is that I\'m running with -WerrorThis is your real problem, IMO. You can try some automated ways of moving from (char *) to (const char *) but I would put money on them not just working. You will have to have a human involved for at least some of the work.\nFor the short term, just ignore the warning (but IMO leave it on, or it\'ll never get fixed) and just remove the -Werror.Thanks, all, for the help.  Picking from here and there comes this solution.  This compiles clean.  Have not tested the code yet.  Tomorrow...  maybe...I know, there\'s only 1 item in the timeServer array.  But there could be more.  The rest were commented out for now to save memory.watch the name field, in gcc it compile without warning, but in g++ it will, i don\'t know why.in gcc (Compiling C), -Wno-write-strings is active by default.in g++ (Compiling C++) -Wwrite-strings is active by defaultThis is why there is a different behaviour.\nFor us using macros of Boost_python generates such warnings.\nSo we use -Wno-write-strings when compiling C++ since we always use -Werror
