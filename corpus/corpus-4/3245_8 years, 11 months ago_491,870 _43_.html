I have a form with many input fields.When I catch the submit form event with jQuery, is it possible to get all the input fields of that form in an associative array?Thanks to the tip from Simon_Weaver, here is another way you could do it, using serializeArray:Note that this snippet will fail on <select multiple> elements.It appears that the new HTML 5 form inputs don\'t work with serializeArray in jQuery version 1.3. This works in version 1.4+Late to the party on this question, but this is even easier:The jquery.form plugin may help with what others are looking for that end up on this question. I\'m not sure if it directly does what you want or not. There is also the serializeArray function.Sometimes I find getting one at a time is more useful.  For that, there\'s this:The elements variable will contain all the inputs, selects, textareas and fieldsets within the form.Had a similar issue with a slight twist and I thought I\'d throw this out. I have a callback function that gets the form so I had a form object already and couldn\'t easy variants on $(\'form:input\'). Instead I came up with:Its similar but not identical situation, but I found this thread very useful and thought I\'d tuck this on the end and hope someone else found it useful.Here is another solution, this way you can fetch all data about the form and use it in a serverside call or something.You can then use this with ajax calls:Hope this is of any use for any of you :)Associative? Not without some work, but you can use generic selectors:jQuery\'s serializeArray does not include disabled fields, so if you need those too, try:http://api.jquery.com/serializearray/This can also be done without jQuery using the XMLHttpRequest Level 2 FormData objecthttp://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-XMLHttpRequest2-20100907/#the-formdata-interfaceDon\'t forget the checkboxes and radio buttons -I had the same problem and solved it in a different way.It returns the value of all input fields. You could change the $(\':input\') to be more specific.If you need to get multiple values from inputs and you\'re using []\'s to define the inputs with multiple values, you can use the following:I am use this code without each loop:Seems strange that nobody has upvoted or proposed a concise solution to getting list data. Hardly any forms are going to be single-dimension objects. The downside of this solution is, of course, that your singleton objects are going to have to be accessed at the [0] index. But IMO that\'s way better than using one of the dozen-line mapping solutions.When I needed to do an ajax call with all the form fields, I had problems with the :input selector returning all checkboxes whether or not they were checked. I added a new selector to just get the submit-able form elements:usage:I\'ve not tested it with multiple select boxes yet though but It works for getting all the form fields in the way a standard submit would.I used this when customising the product options on an OpenCart site to include checkboxes and text fields as well as the standard select box type.serialize() is the best method. @ Christopher Parker say that Nickf\'s anwser accomplishes more, however it does not take into account that the form may contain textarea and select menus.  It is far better to use serialize() and then manipulate that as you need to.  Data from serialize() can be used in either an Ajax post or get, so there is no issue there.Hope this helps somebody. :)All answers are good, but if there\'s a field that you like to ignore in that function? Easy, give the field a property, for example ignore_this:And in your Serialize Function:That\'s the way you ignore some fields.Same solution as given by nickf, but with array input names taken into account\neg <input type="text" name="array[]" />This piece of code will work\ninstead of name, email enter your form fields nameInspired by answers of Lance Rushing and Simon_Weaver, this is my favourite solution.The output is an array of objects, e.g.With the code below,its final output would be
