I wonder what options there are for .net (or C# specifically) Code Coverage, especially in the Lower Priced segment? I am not looking for recommendations, but for a comparison of products based on facts. I know the following:NCrunchNDependI use the version of NCover that comes with TestDriven.NET.  It will allow you to easily right-click on your unit test class library, and hit "Test With -> Coverage", and it will pull up the report.An alternative to NCover can be PartCover, is an open source code coverage tool for .NET very similar to NCover, it includes a console application, a GUI coverage browser, and XSL transforms for use in CC.Net.Very interesting product.UPDATE: OpenCover has replaced partcover.JetBrains(of ReSharper fame) has been working on a coverage tool for a little while called dotCover It\'s showing a great deal of promise.I just tested out NCrunch and have to say I am very impressed. It is a continuous testing tool that will add code coverage to your code in Visual Studio at almost real time. At the time as I write this NCrunch is free. It is a little unclear if it going to be free, cost money or be opened source in the future though.http://blog.ncrunch.net/image.axd?picture=2012%2f4%2fPerformanceCoverage.jpgTestCocoon is also pretty nice: http://www.testcocoon.org/index.html with active development and user community:EDIT:Test cocoon is no longer developed and its creators are now producing a commercial software for C/C++There are pre-release (beta) versions of NCover available for free. They work fine for most cases, especially when combined with NCoverExplorer.Not sure what the difference with the retail NCover, but there is also an NCover project on sourceforge that is of course open source and free.TestMatrix is a unit test runner and Code Coverage tool.http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/TestCoverage/CSharpTestCoverage.htmlVery low overhead, handles huge systems of files, intuitive GUI showing coverage on specific files, and generated report with coverage breakdown at method, class and package levels.Code coverage features, as well as programmable API\'s, come with Visual Studio 2010. Sadly, the only two editions that include the full Code Coverage capabilities are Premium and Ultimate. However, I do believe the API\'s will be available with any edition, so creating code coverage files and writing a viewer for the coverage info would likely be possible.We\'ve release EAP to dotCover (http://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover) and will be releasing the Beta soon. See the C# Test Coverage tool from my company, Semantic Designs:http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/TestCoverage/CSharpTestCoverage.htmlVery low overhead, handles huge systems of files,  intuitive GUI\nshowing coverage on specific files, and generated report with\ncoverage breakdown at method, class and package levels.
