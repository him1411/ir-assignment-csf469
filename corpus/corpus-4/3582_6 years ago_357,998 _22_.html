I would like to have 2 languages for the UI and separate string values for them in my resource file res\\values\\strings.xml:\nNow I need to retrieve these values dynamically in my app:My problem is that i = 0.\nThis code was taken from this link.Why does not it work in my case?The link you are referring to seems to work with strings generated at runtime. The strings from strings.xml are not created at runtime.\nYou can get them via getResources() is a method of the Context class. If you are inside a Activity or a Service (which extend Context) you can use it like in this snippet.Also note that the whole language dependency can be taken care of by the android framework. \nSimply create different folders for each language. If english is your default language, just put the english strings into res/values/strings.xml. Then create a new folder values-ru and put the russian strings with identical names into res/values-ru/strings.xml. From this point on android selects the correct one depending on the device locale for you, either when you call getString() or when referencing strings in XML via @string/mystring.\nThe ones from res/values/strings.xml are the fallback ones, if you don\'t have a folder covering the users locale, this one will be used as default values.See Localization and Providing Resources for more information.I have the same problem. But this code below works for me:\nVerify if your packageName is correct. You have to refer for the root package of your Android application.Not from activities only:I would add something to the solution of leonvian, so if by any chance the string is not found among the resources (return value 0, that is not a valid resource code), the function might return something :Easier way is to use the getString() function within the activity.Reference: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.htmlI think this feature is added in a recent Android version, anyone who knows the history can comment on this.If you don\'t have an Activity reference, you can use your context in this way:There is also a set of predefined Android strings such as "Ok", "Cancel" and many others - so you don\'t have to declare all. They\'re available simply by:(In this case, "Ok" string). BTW there are also other Android resources available like for example icons images etc.A simple way to getting resource ID from string. Here resourceName is the name of resource ImageView in drawable folder which is included in XML file as well.Simple just use this:To learn more see:\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html
