I\'m trying to use the cp command and force an overwrite.I have tried cp -rf /foo/* /bar, but I am still prompted to confirm each overwrite.You can do yes | cp -rf xxx yyy, but my gutfeeling says that if you do it as root - your .bashrc or .profile has an alias of cp to cp -i, most modern systems do that to root profiles. You can check existing aliases by running alias at the command prompt, or which cp to check aliases only for cp.If you do have an alias defined, running unalias cp will abolish that for the current session, otherwise you can just remove it from your shell profile.You can temporarily bypass an alias and use the non-aliased version of a command by prefixing it with \\, e.g. \\cp whateverThis is probably caused by cp being already aliased to something like cp -i. Calling cp directly should work:Another way to get around this is to use the yes command:As some of the other answers have stated, you probably use an alias somewhere which maps cp to cp -i or something similar. You can run a command without any aliases by preceding it with a backslash. In your case, tryThe backslash will temporarily disable any aliases you have called cp.You probably have an alias somewhere, mapping cp to cp -i; because with the default settings, cp won\'t ask to overwrite. Check your .bashrc, your .profile etc.See cp manpage: Only when -i parameter is specified will cp actually prompt before overwriting.You can check this via the alias command:To undefine the alias, use:As other answers have stated, this could happend if cp is an alias of cp -i.You can append a \\ before the cp command to use it without alias.By default cp has aliase to cp -i. You can check it, type alias and you can see some like:To solve this problem just use /bin/cp /from /to command instead cp /from /tocp is usually aliased like thisif you are sure that you want to do the overwrite then use this:you can use this command as well:cp -ru /zzz/zzz/* /xxx/xxxit would update your existing file with the newer one though.Another way to call the command without the alias is to use the command builtin in bash.command cp -rf /zzz/zzz/*-n is "not to overwrite" but his question is totally opposite what you replied for. To avoid this confirmation you can simply run the cp command wiht absolute path, it will avoid the alias./bin/cp sourcefile destinationI simply used unalias to remove the "cp -i" alias, then do the copy, then set back the alias. :   Not the most beautiful code, but easy to set and efficient. I also check the alias is already set back with a simple   If you want to keep alias at the global level as is and just want to change for your script.Just use:alias cp=cpand then write your follow up commands.It is not cp -i. If you do not want to be asked for confirmation,\nit is cp -n; for example:Or in case of directories/folders is:
