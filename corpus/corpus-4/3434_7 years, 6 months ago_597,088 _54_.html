How do I import other files in Python?For example, in main.py I have:although this gives me all the definitions in extra.py when maybe all I want is a single definition:What do I add to the import statement to just get gap from extra.py?Just import file without the \'.py\' extension.You can mark a folder as a package, by adding an empty file named __init__.py.You can use the __import__ function. It takes the module name as a string. (Again: module name without the \'.py\' extension.)Type help(__import__) for more details.Update: Answer above is outdated. Here is a more recent alternative:importlib is recent addition in Python to programmatically import a module. It just a wrapper around __import__ \nSee https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlibDon\'t just hastily pick the first import strategy that works for you or else you\'ll have to rewrite the codebase later on when you find it doesn\'t meet your needs.  I\'ll start out explaining the easiest example #1, then I\'ll move toward the most professional and robust example #5Example 1, Import a python module with python interpreter:Put this in /home/el/foo/fox.py:Get into the python interpreter: You imported fox through the python interpreter, invoked the python function what_does_the_fox_say() from within fox.py.  Example 2, Use execfile or (exec in Python 3) in a script to execute the other python file in place:Put this in /home/el/foo2/mylib.py:Put this in /home/el/foo2/main.py:run the file:The function moobar was imported from mylib.py and made available in main.pyExample 3, Use from ... import ... functionality:Put this in /home/el/foo3/chekov.py:Put this in /home/el/foo3/main.py:Run it like this:If you defined other functions in chekov.py, they would not be available unless you import *Example 4, Import riaa.py if it\'s in a different file location from where it is importedPut this in /home/el/foo4/stuff/riaa.py:Put this in /home/el/foo4/main.py:Run it:That imports everything in the foreign file from a different directory.Example 5, Import files in python with the bare import command:Make an empty file named __init__.py under herp:Make a new directory /home/el/foo5/herp/derpUnder derp, make another __init__.py file:Under /home/el/foo5/herp/derp make a new file called yolo.py Put this in there:The moment of truth, Make the new file /home/el/foo5/main.py, put this in there;Run it:The empty __init__.py file communicates to the python interpreter that the developer intends this directory to be an importable package.If you want to see my post on how to include ALL .py files under a directory see here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20753073/445131Example 6, use os.system("python yourfile.py")Bonus protipwhether you are using Mac, Linux or Windows, you need to be using python\'s idle editor as described here.  It will unlock your python world.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkW5CSZ_VIITo import a specific Python file at \'runtime\' with a known name:...You do not have many complex methods to import a python file from one folder to another. Just create a __init__.py file to declare this folder is a python package and then go to your host file where you want to import just type from root.parent.folder.file import variable, class, whateverImport doc ..The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages, this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path.__init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable.How I import is import the file and use shorthand of it\'s name.Don\'t forget that your importing file MUST BE named with .py extensionthe best way to import .py files is by way of __init__.py. the simplest thing to do, is to create an empty file named __init__.py in the same directory that your.py file is located.this post by Mike Grouchy is a great explanation of __init__.py and its use for making, importing, and setting up python packages.
