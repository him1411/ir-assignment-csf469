I\'m looking to do search replace with regular expressions in Sublime Text 2. The documentation on this is rather anemic. Specifically, I want to do a replace on groups, so something like converting this text:Hello my name is bobAnd this search term:Find what: my name is (\\w)+Replace with: my name used to be $(1)The search term works just fine but I can\'t figure out a way to actually do a replace using the regexp group.Usually a back-reference is either $1 or \\1 (backslash one) for the first capture group (the first match of a pattern in parentheses). So maybe try:orUPDATE:\nAs several people have pointed out, your original capture pattern is incorrect and will only capture the final letter of the name rather than the whole name. You should use the following pattern to capture all of the letters of the name:By the way, in the question above:For:Find part:With replace part:Would return:Change find part to:And replace will be what you expect:While (\\w)+ will match "bob", it is not the grouping you want for replacement. Use the ( ) parentheses in your search stringBoth answers here does provide correct answers but there is one important thing to emphasize. All the segments from search query that you want to use in your replacement text must be embraced by ( ) parentheses, otherwise these segments won\'t be reachable with $1, $2,...nor \\1, \\2,.. and etc.EXAMPLE:Let\'s say you have a file containing:and the goal is to replace \'em\' with \'px\' but preserve number values (this is only trivial example). The correct way for this to work is to embrace desired $1 value by ( ) parentheses as following:This will work!The following regex pattern will match desired lines but searched values will not be available in replaced string as matched segments ($1):Why? Using segment $1 in replacement text gives us nothing!Here is a visual presentation of the approved answer.Note that if you use more than 9 capture groups you have to use the syntax ${10}.$10 or \\10 or \\{10} will not work.
