I have an image that is Base64 encoded. What is the best way to decode that in Java? Hopefully using only the libraries included with Sun Java 6.As of v6, Java SE ships with JAXB. javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter has static methods that make this easy. See parseBase64Binary() and printBase64Binary().As of Java 8, there is an officially supported API for Base64 encoding and decoding.\nIn time this will probably become the default choice.The API includes the class java.util.Base64 and its nested classes. It supports three different flavors: basic, URL safe, and MIME.Sample code using the "basic" encoding:The documentation for java.util.Base64 includes several more methods for configuring encoders and decoders, and for using different classes as inputs and outputs (byte arrays, strings, ByteBuffers, java.io streams).Here is a working example using Apache Commons codec:Maven / sbt repo: commons-codec, commons-codec, 1.8.No need to use commons--Sun ships a base64 encoder with Java.  You can import it as such:And then use it like this:Where encodedBytes is either a java.lang.String or a java.io.InputStream.  Just beware that the sun.* classes are not "officially supported" by Sun.EDIT: Who knew this would be the most controversial answer I\'d ever post?  I do know that sun.* packages are not supported or guaranteed to continue existing, and I do know about Commons and use it all the time.  However, the poster asked for a class that that was "included with Sun Java 6," and that\'s what I was trying to answer.  I agree that Commons is the best way to go in general.EDIT 2: As amir75 points out below, Java 6+ ships with JAXB, which contains supported code to encode/decode Base64. Please see Jeremy Ross\' answer below.Specifically in Commons Codec: class Base64 to decode(byte[] array) or encode(byte[] array)Guava now has Base64 decoding built in. Use BaseEncoding.base64().decode() As for dealing with possible whitespace in input the recommended way of doing that is the following wayBaseEncoding.base64().decode(CharMatcher.WHITESPACE.removeFrom(...));See this discussion for more informationMy solution is fastest and easiest.No matter what type of app your using (experiment or not), it\'s just as simple as creating a single Base64.java file in your utils package using the code here:http://migbase64.sourceforge.net/Look at the performance charts and notice the difference: 4-5 times as fast.Here\'s my own implementation, if it could be useful to someone : As an alternative to sun.misc.BASE64Decoder or non-core libraries, look at javax.mail.internet.MimeUtility.decode().An example : Encode/Decode to/from Base64Given a test encode/decode example of javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter using methods parseBase64Binary() and printBase64Binary() referring to @jeremy-ross and @nightfirecat answer.Result:Another late answer, but my benchmarking shows that Jetty\'s implementation of Base64 encoder is pretty fast. Not as fast as MiGBase64 but faster than iHarder Base64.I also did some benchmarks:These are runs/sec so higher is better.If You are prefering performance based solution then you can use "MiGBase64"http://migbase64.sourceforge.net/FYI: JEP 135 proposes to introduce a standard, discoverable API for this in the Java platform.Hope this helps you:   Or:java.util.prefs.Base64 works on local rt.jar,But it is not in The JRE Class White Listand not in Available classes not listed in the GAE/J white-listWhat a pity!PS. In android, it\'s easy because that android.util.Base64 has been included since Android API Level 8.This is a late answer, but Joshua Bloch committed his Base64 class (when he was working for Sun, ahem, Oracle) under the java.util.prefs package. This class existed since JDK 1.4.E.g.You can write or download file from encoded Base64 string:Worked for me and hopefully for you also...If you are already adding AWS SDK for Java, you can use com.amazonaws.util.Base64.The Java 8 implementation of java.util.Base64 has no dependencies on other Java 8 specific classes.I am not certain if this will work for Java 6 project, but it is possible to copy and paste the Base64.java file into a Java 7 project and compile it with no modification other than importing java.util.Arrays and java.util.Objects.Note the Base64.java file is covered by the GNU GPL2I used android.util.base64 that works pretty good without any dependances: Usage:package com.test;
