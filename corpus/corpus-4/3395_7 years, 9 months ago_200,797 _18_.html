This question already has an answer here:I want to put a quick "are you sure?" prompt for confirmation at the top of a potentially dangerous bash script, what\'s the easiest/best way to do this?Edit:I incorporated levislevis85\'s suggestion (thanks!) and added the -n option to read to accept one character without the need to press Enter. You can use one or both of these.Also, the negated form might look like this:However, as pointed out by Erich, under some circumstances such as a syntax error caused by the script being run in the wrong shell, the negated form could allow the script to continue to the "dangerous stuff". The failure mode should favor the safest outcome so only the first, non-negated if should be used.use case/esac. advantage: Try the read shell builtin:This way you get \'y\' \'yes\' or \'Enter\'Here\'s the function I use :And an example using it:I hope you like it,\nCheers!This what I found elsewhere, is there a better possible version?used this in a function to look for an existing file and prompt before overwriting.I s a short script to read in bash and echo back results.qnd: use for a one line response without readline support.  Then test $VARNAME however you want.
