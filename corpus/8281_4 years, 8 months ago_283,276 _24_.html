I know that this could be solved fairly easily with Javascript, but I\'m only interested in a pure CSS solution. I want a way to dynamically resize text so that it always fits into a fixed div. Here is the sample markup:I was thinking that maybe this could be possible by specifying the width of the container in ems, and getting the font-size to inherit that value?I just found out that this is possible using VW units. They\'re the units associated with setting the viewport width. There are some drawbacks, such as lack of legacy browser support, but this is definitely something to seriously consider using. Plus you can still provide fallbacks for older browsers like so:http://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/\nand \nhttps://medium.com/design-ux/66bddb327bb1CSS3 supports  new dimensions that are relative to view port. But this doesn\'t work in android < 4.43.2vmax = Bigger of 3.2vw or 3.2vhsee css-tricks.com/.... and also look at caniuse.com/.... or Use media query.Simplest way is to use dimensions in % or em. Just change the base font size everything will change.Use dimensions in % or em. Just change the base font size everything will change. In previous one you could just change the body font and not h1 every time or let base font size to default of the device and rest all in em see kyleschaeffer.com/.... for more info on em, px and %The only way would probably be to set different widths for different screen sizes, but this approach is pretty inacurate and you should use a js solution.I know I\'m ressurecting a long dead question, but I had the same question and I wanted to add something. Please don\'t ban me for this, I felt it was important enough to justify this answer, I\'ll delete if required. @Joseph Silber is wrong, coding all the possibilities actually is a viable way to do this. The reason is because there actually aren\'t infinite possibilities. Well, technically there are, but 99% of your visitors will be using a standard resolution. This is doubly true for mobile (the main reason for responsive web design) because most mobile OSes run apps full screen with no window resizing.Also, height is pretty much irrelevant because of the scrollbar (to a point, I would immediately leave a web page that was more than 4 or 5 feet long, but this mostly holds true), so you only need to worry about width. And really, the only widths you need to code for are the following: 240, 320, 480 (for older iThings), 640, 800, 1024, 1280, 1440, 1600, 1920, 2048, 2560. Don\'t even bother for 4k, it will bloat your images too much and the 2560 size stretched to 100% width looks just fine on a 4k monitor (I\'ve tested this). Also, don\'t bother with 720 (720x480) as the previous poster suggested. Its a resolution used almost exclusively by digital cameras, and even then its very uncommon.If someone is using an exotic resolution, nearly any renderer made in the past 15 years will round down, so if someone\'s screen width is, say. 1100, its going to load the 1024 CSS rule, your site shouldn\'t break. This renders accounting for exotic resolutions by trying to create a responsive rule unnecessary, and the idea that you need to code for every possible setup pixel by pixel is ridiculous, unless someone\'s using a web browser so outdated that your site probably wouldn\'t load at all anyway.As many mentioned in comments to @DMTinter\'s post, the OP was asking about the number ("amount") of characters changing.  He was also asking about CSS, but as @Alexander indicated, "it is not possible with only CSS".  As far as I can tell, that seems to be true at this time, so it also seems logical that people would want to know the next best thing.I\'m not particularly proud of this, but it does work.  Seems like an excessive amount of code to accomplish it.  This is the core:Here\'s a JS Bin: http://jsbin.com/pidavon/edit?html,css,js,console,output\nPlease suggest possible improvements to it (I\'m not really interested in using canvas to measure the text...seems like too much overhead(?)).Thanks to @Pete for measureText function:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/4032497/442665You might be interested in the calc approach:done. Tweak values till matches your taste.Source: https://codepen.io/CrocoDillon/pen/fBJxu
