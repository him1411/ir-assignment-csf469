What does the following exception mean; how can I fix it?This is the code:This is the exception:You\'re calling it from a worker thread. You need to call Toast.makeText() (and most other functions dealing with the UI) from within the main thread. You could use a handler, for example.Look up Communicating with the UI Thread in the documentation. In a nutshell:Other options:You could use an AsyncTask, that works well for most things running in the background. It has hooks that you can call to indicate the progress, and when it\'s done.You could also use Activity.runOnUiThread().You need to call Toast.makeText(...) from the UI thread:This is copy-pasted from another (duplicate) SO answer.The best alternative is to use RxAndroid (specific bindings for RxJava) for the P in MVP to take charge fo data.Start by returning Observable from your existing method.Use this Observable like this -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know I am a little late but here goes.\nAndroid basically works on two thread types namely UI thread and background thread. According to android documentation - Do not access the Android UI toolkit from outside the UI thread to fix this problem, Android offers several ways to access the UI thread from other threads. Here is a list of methods that can help:Now there are various methods to solve this problem. I will explain it by code sample:Class used to run a message loop for a thread. Threads by default do\n  not have a message loop associated with them; to create one, call\n  prepare() in the thread that is to run the loop, and then loop() to\n  have it process messages until the loop is stopped.AsyncTask allows you to perform asynchronous work on your user\n  interface. It performs the blocking operations in a worker thread and\n  then publishes the results on the UI thread, without requiring you to\n  handle threads and/or handlers yourself.A Handler allows you to send and process Message and Runnable objects\n  associated with a thread\'s MessageQueue.Try this, when you see runtimeException due to Looper not prepared before handler.I ran into the same problem, and here is how I fixed it:To create the UIHandler, you\'ll need to perform the following:Hope this helps.Reason for an error:Worker threads are meant for doing background tasks and you can\'t show anything on UI within a worker thread unless you call method like runOnUiThread. If you try to show anything on UI thread without calling runOnUiThread, there will be a java.lang.RuntimeException.So, if you are in an activity but calling Toast.makeText() from worker thread, do this:The above code ensures that you are showing the Toast message in a UI thread since you are calling it inside runOnUiThread method. So no more java.lang.RuntimeException.I was getting this error until I did the following.And made this into a singleton class:that\'s what i did.Visual components are "locked" to changes from outside threads.\nSo, since the toast shows stuff on the main screen that is managed by the main thread, you need to run this code on that thread.\nHope that helps:)An advantage of this method is that you can use in non-activity classes also:The answer by ChicoBird worked for me. The only change I made was in the creation of the UIHandler where I had to do Eclipse refused to accept anything else. Makes sense I suppose.Also the uiHandler is clearly a class global defined somewhere. I still don\'t claim to understand how Android is doing this and what is going on but I am glad it works. Now I will proceed to study it and see if I can understand what Android is doing and why one has to go through all these hoops and loops. Thanks for the help ChicoBird.This is because Toast.makeText() is calling from a worker thread. It should be call from main UI thread like this    I was running into the same issue when my callbacks would try to show a dialog.  I solved it with dedicated methods in the Activity - at the Activity instance member level - that use runOnUiThread(..)To display a dialog or a toaster in a thread, the most concise way is to use the Activity object.For example:For Rxjava and RxAndroid User:Toast, AlertDialogs needs to run on UI thread, you can use Asynctask to use them properly in android development.but some cases we need to customize the time outs, so we use Threads, but in threads we cannot use Toast,Alertdialogs like we using in AsyncTask.So we need separate Handler  for popup those.in Above example i want to sleep my thread in 3sec and after i want to show a Toast message,for that in your mainthread implement handler.I used switch case here, because if you need to show different message in same way, you can use switch case within Handler class...hope this will help you
