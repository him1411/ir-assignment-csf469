I\'ve been using word-wrap: break-word to wrap text in divs and spans. However, it doesn\'t seem to work in table cells. I have a table set to width:100%, with one row and two columns. Text in columns, although styled with the above word-wrap, doesn\'t wrap. It causes the text to go past the bounds of the cell. This happens on Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.Here\'s what the source looks like:"Long Content" is larger than the bounds of my page, but it doesn\'t break with the above HTML. I\'ve tried the suggestions below of adding text-wrap:suppress and text-wrap:normal, but neither helped.The following works for me in Internet Explorer. Note the addition of the table-layout:fixed CSS attributeor A long shot, but double-check with Firebug (or similar) that you aren\'t accidentally inheriting the following rule:This may override your specified line break behaviour.Turns out there\'s no good way of doing this. The closest I came is adding "overflow:hidden;" to the div around the table and losing the text.\nThe real solution seems to be to ditch table though. Using divs and relative positioning I was able to achieve the same effect, minus the legacy of <table>2015 UPDATE: This is for those like me who want this answer. After 6 years, this works, thanks to all the contributors.As mentioned, putting the text within div almost works. You just have to specify the width of the div, which is fortunate static layouts.This works on FF 3.6, IE 8, Chrome.Problem withis that it will work not so good when text has some spaces, e.g.If word andthenlongerwithoutspaces fits into table cell in one line but long text with andthenlongerwithoutspaces does not, the long word will be broken in two, instead of being wrapped.Alternative solution: insert U+200B (ZWSP), U+00AD (soft hyphen)\n or U+200C (ZWNJ) in every long word after every, say, 20th character.Change your codetoExampleCheck out this demoHere is the link to readText from http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#word-wrapThis property specifies whether the UA may break within a word to prevent overflow when an otherwise-unbreakable string is too long to fit within the line box. It only has an effect when \'text-wrap\' is either \'normal\' or \'suppress\'. Possible valuesTested in IE 8 and Chrome 13.This causes the table to fit the width of the page and each column to take up 50% of the width.If you prefer the first column to take up more of the page, add a width: 80% to the td as in the following example, replacing 80% with the percentage of your choice.The only thing that needs to be done is add width to the <td> or the <div> inside the <td> depending on the layout you want to achieve.eg:orIt appears you need to set word-wrap:break-word; on a block element (div), with specified (non relative) width. Ex:or using word-break:break-all per Abhishek Simon\'s suggestion.The answer that won the bounty is correct, but it doesn\'t work if the first row of the table has a merged/joined cell (all the cells get equal width).In this case you should use the colgroup and col tags to display it properly:Tables wrap by default, so make sure the display of the table cells are table-cell:For the lack of runnable code snippets:If you do not need a table border, apply this: This works for me:And table attribute is:I found a solution that seems to work in Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 7-9. For doing a two-column table layout with long text on the one side. I searched all over for similar problem, and what worked in one browser broke the other, or adding more tags to a table just seems like bad coding.I did NOT use a table for this. DL DT DD to the rescue. At least for fixing a two-column layout, that is basically a glossary/dictionary/word-meaning setup.And some generic styling.Using floating word-wrap and margin left, I got exactly what I needed. Just thought I\'d share this with others, maybe it will help someone else with a two-column definition style layout, with trouble getting the words to wrap.I tried using word-wrap in the table cell, but it only worked in Internet Explorer 9, (and Firefox and Google Chrome of course) mainly trying to fix the broken Internet Explorer browser here.style="table-layout:fixed; width:98%; word-wrap:break-word" Demo - http://jsfiddle.net/Ne4BR/749/This worked great for me.  I had long links that would cause the table to exceed 100% on web browsers.\nTested on IE, Chrome, Android and Safari.BobbyA solution which work with Google Chrome and Firefox (not tested with Internet Explorer) is to set display: table-cell as a block element.
