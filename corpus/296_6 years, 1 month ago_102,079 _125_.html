There\'re plenty of different CSS shapes over at CSS Tricks - Shapes of CSS and I\'m particularly puzzled with a triangle:How and why does it work?As alex said, borders of equal width butt up against each other at 45 degree angles:When you have no top border, it looks like this:Then you give it a width of 0......and a height of 0......and finally, you make the two side borders transparent:That results in a triangle.The EndThe borders use an angled edge where they intersect (45\xc2\xb0 angle with equal width borders, but changing the border widths can skew the angle).jsFiddle.By hiding certain borders, you can get the triangle effect (as you can see above by making the different portions different colours). transparent is often used as an edge colour to achieve the triangle shape.Start with a basic square and borders. Each border will be given a different color so we can tell them apart:which gives you this:But there\'s no need for the top border, so set its width to 0px. Now our border-bottom of 200px will make our triangle 200px tall.and we will get this:Then to hide the two side triangles, set the border-color to transparent. Since the top-border has been effectively deleted, we can set the border-top-color to transparent as well.finally we get this:Different approach:Triangular shape is pretty easy to make using this technique. For people who prefer to see an animation explaining how this technique works here it is :Otherwise, here is detailed explanation in 4 acts (this is not a tragedy) of how to make an isosceles right-angled triangle with one element.Easy, just make sure that width = 1.41 x height. You may use any techinque (see here) including the use of percentages and padding-bottom to maintain the aspect ratio and make a responsive triangle. In the following image, the div has a golden yellow border.In that div, insert a pseudo element and give it 100% width and height of parent. The pseudo element has a blue background in the following image.At this point, we have this CSS :First, most important : define a transform origin. The default origin is in the center of the pseudo element and we need it at the bottom left. By adding this CSS to the pseudo element : transform-origin:0 100%; or transform-origin: left bottom;Now we can rotate the pseudo element 45 degrees clockwise with transform : rotate(45deg);At this point, we have this CSS :To hide the unwanted parts of the pseudo element (everything that overflows the div with the yellow border) you just need to set overflow:hidden; on the container. after removing the yellow border, you get... a TRIANGLE! :DEMOCSS :As shown in the demo, you can customize the triangles :Here is an animation in JSFiddle I created for demonstration.Also see snippet below.  This is an Animated GIF made from a ScreencastLets say we have the following div:Now Edit the CSS step-by-step, so you will get clear idea what is happening aroundSTEP 1: \nJSfiddle Link:This is a simple div. With a very simple CSS. So a layman can understand. Div has dimensions 150 x 150 pixels with the border 50 pixels. The image is attached:STEP 2: JSfiddle Link:Now I just changed the border-color of all 4 sides. The image is attached.STEP:3 JSfiddle Link:Now I just changed the height & width of div from 150 pixels to zero. The image is attached STEP 4: JSfiddle:Now I have made all the borders transparent apart from the bottom border. The image is attached below.STEP 5: JSfiddle Link:Now I just changed the background color to white. The image is attached.Hence we got the triangle we needed.And now something completely different...Instead of using css tricks don\'t forget about solutions as simple as html entities:Result:â–²See: What are the HTML entities for up and down triangles?Consider the below triangleThis is what we are given:Why it came out in this shape? The below diagram explains the dimensions, note that 15px was used for the bottom border and 10px was used for left and right.It\'s pretty easy to make a right-angle triangle also by removing the right border.Taking it one step further, using css based on this I added arrows to my back and next buttons (yes I know its not 100% cross-browser, but slick none the less).Different approach. With linear gradient (for IE, only IE 10+).\nYou can use any angle:Here is jsfiddleThis is an old question, but I think will worth it to share how to create an arrow using this triangle technique.Lets create 2 triangles, for the second one we will use the :after pseudo class and position it just below the other:Now we just have to set the predominant border color of the second triangle to the same color of the background:Fiddle with all the arrows:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/tomsarduy/r0zksgeu/I wrote this to make it easier (and DRY) to automatically generate a CSS triangle:Important note: if the triangle seems pixelated in some browsers, try one of the methods described here.This is something I feel this question has missed; clip-pathclip-path in a nutshellClipping, with the clip-path property, is akin to cutting a shape (like a circle or a pentagon) from a rectangular piece of paper. The property belongs to the \xe2\x80\x9cCSS Masking Module Level 1\xe2\x80\x9d specification. The spec states, \xe2\x80\x9cCSS masking provides two means for partially or fully hiding portions of visual elements: masking and clipping\xe2\x80\x9d.clip-path will use the element itself rather than its borders to cut the shape you specify in its parameters. It uses a super simple percentage based co-ordinate system which makes editing it very easy and means you can pick it up and create weird and wonderful shapes in a matter of minutes.It does have a major downside at the moment, one being it\'s major lack of support, only really being covered within -webkit- browsers and having no support on IE and only very partial in FireFox.Here are some useful resources and material to help better understand clip-path and also start creating your own.I made a sample in enjoycsshttp://enjoycss.com/5p#borderyou can play with it and see how the thing changes ;)OK, this triangle will get created because of the way that borders of the elements work together... As we usually use 1 or 2px borders, we never notice that borders make a 45\xc2\xb0 angles to each others with the same width and if the width changes, the angle degree get changed as well, run the CSS code I created below:Then in the next step, we don\'t have any width or height, something like this:And now we make the left and right borders invisible to make our desirable triangle as below:If you not willing to run the snippet to see the steps, I\'ve created an image sequence to have a look at all steps in one image:Others have already explained this well. Let me give you an animation which will explain this quickly: http://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/lotjhHere is some code for you to play with and learn the concepts.HTML:CSS:Play with this and see what happens. Set height and width to zero. Then remove top border and make left and right transparent, or just look at the code below to make a css triangle:here is another fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/qdhvdb17/
