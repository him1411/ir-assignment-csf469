A nice and simple question - is the function of "git fetch" a strict sub-set of git fetch --tags?I.e. if I run git fetch --tags, is there ever a reason to immediately run git fetch straight afterward?What about git pull and git pull --tags? Same situation?Note: starting with git 1.9/2.0 (Q1 2014), git fetch --tags fetches tags in addition to what are fetched by the same command line without the option.See commit c5a84e9 by Michael Haggerty (mhagger):Previously, fetch\'s "--tags" option was considered equivalent to specifying the refspec   on the command line;\n  in particular, it caused the remote.<name>.refspec configuration to be ignored.But it is not very useful to fetch tags without also fetching other references, whereas it is quite useful to be able to fetch tags in addition to other references.\n  So change the semantics of this option to do the latter.If a user wants to fetch only tags, then it is still possible to specifying an explicit refspec:Please note that the documentation prior to 1.8.0.3 was ambiguous about this aspect of "fetch --tags" behavior.\n  Commit f0cb2f1 (2012-12-14) fetch --tags made the documentation match the old behavior.\n  This commit changes the documentation to match the new behavior (see Documentation/fetch-options.txt).Request that all tags be fetched from the remote in addition to whatever else is being fetched.Since Git 2.5 (Q2 2015) git pull --tags is more robust:See commit 19d122b by Paul Tan (pyokagan), 13 May 2015.\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit cc77b99, 22 May 2015)Since 441ed41 ("git pull --tags": error out with a better message.,\n  2007-12-28, Git 1.5.4+), git pull --tags would print a different error message if\n  git-fetch did not return any merge candidates:This is because at that time, git-fetch --tags would override any\n  configured refspecs, and thus there would be no merge candidates. The error message was thus introduced to prevent confusion.However, since c5a84e9 (fetch --tags: fetch tags in addition to\n  other stuff, 2013-10-30, Git 1.9.0+), git fetch --tags would fetch tags in addition\n  to any configured refspecs.\n  Hence, if any no merge candidates situation occurs, it is not because --tags was set. As such, this special error message is now irrelevant.To prevent confusion, remove this error message.With Git 2.11+ (Q4 2016) git fetch is quicker.See commit 5827a03 (13 Oct 2016) by Jeff King (peff).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit 9fcd144, 26 Oct 2016) When fetching from a remote that has many tags that are irrelevant to branches we are following, we used to waste way too many cycles when checking if the object pointed at by a tag (that we are not going to fetch!) exists in our repository too carefully.This patch teaches fetch to use HAS_SHA1_QUICK to sacrifice\n  accuracy for speed, in cases where we might be racy with a\n  simultaneous repack.Here are results from the included perf script, which sets up a situation similar to the one described above:That applies only for a situation where:Note: this answer is only valid for git v1.8 and older.Most of this has been said in the other answers and comments, but here\'s a concise explanation:Summary: If you really want to be totally up to date, using only fetch, you must do both. It\'s also not "twice as slow" unless you mean in terms of typing on the command-line, in which case aliases solve your problem. There is essentially no overhead in making the two requests, since they are asking for different information.I\'m going to answer this myself.I\'ve determined that there is a difference. "git fetch --tags" might bring in all the tags, but it doesn\'t bring in any new commits!Turns out one has to do this to be totally "up to date", i.e. replicated a "git pull" without the merge:This is a shame, because it\'s twice as slow. If only "git fetch" had an option to do what it normally does and bring in all the tags.The general problem here is that git fetch will fetch +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/$remote/*.  If any of these commits have tags, those tags will also be fetched.  However if there are tags not reachable by any branch on the remote, they will not be fetched.The --tags option switches the refspec to +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*.  You could ask git fetch to grab both. I\'m pretty sure to just do a git fetch && git fetch -t you\'d use the following command:And if you wanted to make this the default for this repo, you can add a second refspec to the default fetch:This will add a second fetch = line in the .git/config for this remote.I spent a while looking for the way to handle this for a project.  This is what I came up with.In my case I wanted these featuresIn most situations, git fetch should do what you want, which is \'get anything new from the remote repository and put it in your local copy without merging to your local branches\'.  git fetch --tags does exactly that, except that it doesn\'t get anything except new tags.In that sense, git fetch --tags is in no way a superset of git fetch.  It is in fact exactly the opposite.git pull, of course, is nothing but a wrapper for a git fetch <thisrefspec>; git merge.  It\'s recommended that you get used to doing manual git fetching and git mergeing before you make the jump to git pull simply because it helps you understand what git pull is doing in the first place.That being said, the relationship is exactly the same as with git fetch.  git pull is the superset of git pull --tags.
