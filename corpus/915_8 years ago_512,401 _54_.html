I am using this code:And this HTML:The problem is that I have links inside the DIV and when they no longer work when clicked.Had the same problem, came up with this easy solution. It\'s even working recursive:You\'d better go with something like this:You might want to check the target of the click event that fires for the body instead of relying on stopPropagation.Something like:Also, the body element may not include the entire visual space shown in the browser.  If you notice that your clicks are not registering, you may need to add the click handler for the HTML element instead.This code detects any click event on the page and then hides the #CONTAINER element if and only if the element clicked was neither the #CONTAINER element nor one of its descendants.Live DEMOCheck click area is not in the targeted element or in it\'s childUPDATE:jQuery stop propagation is the best solutionLive DEMOUpdated the solution to:var mouseOverActiveElement = false;A solution without jQuery for the most popular answer:MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Node/containsLive demo with ESC functionalityWorks on both Desktop and Mobile\n\nIf for some case you need to be sure that your element is really visible when you do clicks on the document: if($pop.is(\':visible\') && (notH||e.which==27)) $pop.hide();Wouldn\'t something like this work?orHere\'s a jsfiddle I found on another thread, works with esc key also: http://jsfiddle.net/S5ftb/404Built off of prc322\'s awesome answer.This adds a couple things...I hope this helps someone!Even sleaker:And for Touch devices like IPAD and IPHONE we can use following codeif you have trouble with ios, mouseup is not working on apple device.does mousedown /mouseup in jquery work for the ipad?i use this:p is the element name. Where one can pass the id or class or element name also.i did it like this:Return false if you click on .form_wrapper:Attach a click event to top level elements outside the form wrapper, for example:This will also work on touch devices, just make sure you don\'t include a parent of .form_wrapper in your list of selectors.I wanted to like the most-voted for suggestion, but it didn\'t work for me.This method is nearly the same but worked for me.\nhttp://www.codesynthesis.co.uk/code-snippets/use-jquery-to-hide-a-div-when-the-user-clicks-outside-of-it(Just adding on to prc322\'s answer.)In my case I\'m using this code to hide a navigation menu that appears when the user clicks an appropriate tab. I found it was useful to add an extra condition, that the target of the click outside the container is not a link.This is because some of the links on my site add new content to the page. If this new content is added at the same time that the navigation menu disappears it might be disorientating for the user.FIDDLEInstead of listening to every single click on the DOM to hide one specific element, you could set tabindex to the parent <div> and listen to the focusout events.Setting tabindex will make sure that the blur event is fired on the <div> (normally it wouldn\'t).So your HTML would look like:And your JS:By using this code you can hide as many items as you want What you can do is bind a click event to the document that will hide the dropdown if something outside the dropdown is clicked, but won\'t hide it if something inside the dropdown is clicked, so your "show" event (or slidedown or whatever shows the dropdown) Then when hiding it, unbind the click eventAccording to the docs, .blur() works for more than the <input> tag. For example:
