I did a git commit -m "message" like thisbut afterwards, when I do git status it shows the same modified files:What am I doing wrong?As the message says:no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")Git has a "staging area" where files need to be added before being committed, you can read an explanation of it here.\nFor your specific example, you can use:(note the extra a in the flags, can also be written as git commit -a -m "message" - both do the same thing)Alternatively, if you want to be more selective about what you add to the commit, you use the git add command to add the appropriate files to the staging area, and git status to preview what is about to be added (remembering to pay attention to the wording used).You can also find general documentation and tutorials for how to use git on the git documentation page which will give more detail about the concept of staging/adding files.\nOne other thing worth knowing about is interactive staging - this allows you to add parts of a file to the staging area, so if you\'ve made three distinct code changes (for related but different functionality), you can use interactive mode to split the changes and add/commit each part in turn. Having smaller specific commits like this can be helpful.You didn\'t add the changes. Either specifically add them viaor add all changes (from root path of the project)or use the shorthand -a while commiting:you should doI copied a small sub project I had that was under git source into another project and forgot to delete the .git folder. When I went to commit got the same message as above and couldn\'t clear it until I deleted the .git folder. Bit silly, but worth checking you don\'t have a .git folder under the folder that doesn\'t commit.You could have done a:To check which files you modified and are going to be added (dry run: -n option), and thenTo add just modified filesMaybe an obvious thing but... If you have problem with the index, use the\ngit gui\nYou get a very good view how the index (staging area) actually works.Another source of info that helped me understand the index was Scott Chacons "Getting Git" page 259 and forward.I started off using the command line because most documentation only shown that...I think the git gui and gitk actually make me work faster and I got rid of bad habits like "git pull" for example... Now I always fetch first... see what the new changes really are before I merge.I find this problem appearing when I\'ve done a git add . in a subdirectory below where my .gitignore file lives (the home directory of my repository, so to speak).  Try changing directories to your uppermost directory and running git add . followed by git commit -m "my commit message".The reason why this is happening is because you have a folder that is already being tracked by git inside another folder that is also tracked by git. For example, I had a project and I added a subfolder to it. Both of them were being tracked by git before I put one inside the other. In order to stop tracking the one inside, find it and remove the git file withIn my case I had a wordpress app and the folder I added inside was a theme. So I had to go to the theme root, and remove the git file, so that the whole project would now be tracked by the parent, the wordpress app.I had an issue where I was doing commit --amend even after issuing a git add . and it still wasn\'t working.  Turns out I made some .vimrc customizations and my editor wasn\'t working correctly.  Fixing these errors so that vim returns the correct code resolved the issue.
