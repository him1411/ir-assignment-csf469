Is there a more flexbox-ish way to right-align "Contact" than to use position: absolute?http://jsfiddle.net/vqDK9/Here you go. Set justify-content: space-between on the flex container. A more flex approach would be to use an auto left margin (flex items treat auto margins a bit differently than when used in a block formatting context).Updated fiddleIf you want to use flexbox for this, you should be able to, by doing this (display: flex on the container, flex: 1 on the items, and text-align: right on .c):...or alternatively (even simpler), if the items don\'t need to meet, you can use justify-content: space-between on the container and remove the text-align rules completely:Here\'s a demo on Codepen to allow you to quickly try the above.You can also use a filler to fill the remaining space.
