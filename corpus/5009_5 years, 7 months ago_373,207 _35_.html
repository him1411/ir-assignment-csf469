I have install Mountain Lion (Mac OS X 10.8) and now gcc doesn\'t seem to be available anymore.  I\'ve also installed Xcode 4.4 so there is no more /Developer directory.I need gcc both for mac ports and for ruby gems (that have native extensions).Does Xcode 4.4 include gcc or is there a way to install gcc?Update:You can now just run the following command from your terminal:Starting with Xcode 4.3 - you must now manually install command line tools from Xcode menu > Preferences > Downloads.Alternatively, there are stand-alone installation packages both for Mountain Lion (10.8) and for Mavericks (10.9).This package enables UNIX-style development via Terminal by installing\n  command line developer tools, as well as Mac OS X SDK frameworks and\n  headers. Many useful tools are included, such as the Apple LLVM\n  compiler, linker, and Make. If you use Xcode, these tools are also\n  embedded within the Xcode IDE, and can be installed on your system\n  using the Downloads preferences pane within Xcode 4.3 and later.  This\n  package requires Mac OS X 10.7.3 or later.I found that after upgrading from Lion my install was failing because it was looking for GCC in /usr/bin/gcc-4.2.  Now the default installation path is /usr/bin/gcc.  My error looked like this:A symlink will sort out the issue:Just paste this into terminal:I hope that helps!pre-1.9.3 Ruby on Mountain LionPre-requisitesInstall GCCNote, the Xcode Command Line Tools do not include GCC, they include LLVM-GCC.

In that \'OSX GCC Installer\' area, the first of two options is pre-built binaries \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0for Snow Leopard and for Lion, but not for Mountain\xc2\xa0Lion. Considering what\'s included, I should not recommend using that project\'s GCC-10.7-v2.pkg after installing version 4.4 of Xcode on\xc2\xa0any build of 10.8. The more relevant option is build your own, with reference to Apple open source for Developer\xc2\xa0Tools. Apple Open Source for the most recently published Developer Tools 4.3 is without GCC. The source for GCC in the 4.1 area may be too old for use with 10.8. GCC home page for the most recent release. Build status for GCC 4.7 links to results for x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6Apple provides an .mpkg installer for the Command Line Tools (CLT), but they don\'t normally expose the link. It includes GCC. You can install it without downloading/installing XCode.Download Command Line Tools w/ GCC here.You can compile it yourself with this Makefile. If you want to save yourself 2-5 hours, I created a signed installer package with GCC 4.7.2 for Mac OSX Mountain Lion which you can download here.You can download the installer(.pkg file) lattest version of GCC for Mountain Lion from this site. You simpy need to download and install it. https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/downloadsI\'m using OS X 10.9 Mavericks. I only happened to type gcc -v. The system downloaded gcc immediately. Installation completed without Xcode being installed at all. Testing "Hello, world!" works.
