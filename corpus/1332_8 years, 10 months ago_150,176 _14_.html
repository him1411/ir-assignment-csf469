I\'ve got two branches that are fully merged together.However, after the merge is done, I realise that one file has been messed up by the merge (someone else did an auto-format, gah), and it would just be easier to change to the new version in the other branch, and then re-insert my one line change after bringing it over into my branch.So what\'s the easiest way in git to do this?Run this from the branch where you want the file to end up:General formulas:Some notes (from comments):an alternative:I ended up at this question on a similar search. In my case I was looking to extract a file from another branch into current working directory that was different from the file\'s original location. Answer:What about using checkout command :Following madlep\'s answer you can also just copy one directory from another branch with the directory blob.As to the op\'s question if you\'ve only changed one file in there this will work fine ^_^1) Ensure you\'re in branch where you need a copy of the file.\nfor eg: i want sub branch file in master so you need to checkout or should be in master git checkout master2) Now checkout specific file alone you want from sub branch into master,here sub_branch means where you have that file followed by filename you need to copy.
