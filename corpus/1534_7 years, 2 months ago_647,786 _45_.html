I have lines like these, and I want to know how many lines I actually have...Is there a way to count them all using linux commands?Use wc:This will output the number of lines in <filename>:Or, to omit the <filename> from the result use wc -l < <filename>:You can also pipe data to wc as well:To count all lines use:To filter and count only lines with pattern use:Or use -v to invert match:See the grep man page to take a look at the -e,-i and -x args...Orthere are many ways. using wc is one.wc -l fileothers includeawk \'END{print NR}\' filesed -n \'$=\' file (GNU sed)The tool wc is the "word counter" in UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, you can also use it to count lines in a file, by adding the -l option, so wc -l foo will count the number of lines in foo. You can also pipe output from a program like this: ls -l | wc -l, which will tell you how many files are in the current directory.Use wc:If you want to check the total line of all the files in a directory ,you can use find and wc:If all you want is the number of lines (and not the number of lines and the stupid file name coming back):As previously mentioned these also work (but are inferior for other reasons):  Use nl like this:From man nl:Write  each  FILE to standard output, with line numbers added.  With\n  no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.I\'ve been using this:I prefer it over the accepted answer because it does not print the filename, and you don\'t have to use awk to fix that. Accepted answer:wc -l myfile.txtBut I think the best one is GGB667\'s answer:wc -l < myfile.txtI will probably be using that from now on. It\'s slightly shorter than my way. I am putting up my old way of doing it in case anyone prefers it. The output is the same with those two methods.Above are the preferred  method but "cat" command can also helpful:Will show you whole content of file with line numbers.Returns only the number of linesI saw this question while I was looking for a way to count multiple files lines, \nso if you want to count multiple file lines of a .txt file you can do this, it will also run on one .txt file ;)Redirection/Piping the output of the file to wc -l should suffice, like the following:which then would provide the no. of lines only. I just made a program to do this ( with node )https://github.com/danschumann/gimme-lines/tree/masterAs others said wc -l is the best solution, but for future reference you can use Perl:$. contains line number and END block will execute at the end of script.I know this is old but still: Count filtered linesMy file looks like:If I want to know how many files are sent OK:OR
