Is there a way to rename an open file in Emacs? While I\'m viewing it? Something like save-as, but the original one should go away.Try this function from Steve Yegge\'s .emacs:Take a look at that page, there\'s another really useful related function there, called "move-buffer-file".Yes, with dired mode, you can:The rename is equivalent to a shell mv, but it will also update any open buffers.Just for completeness, since some folks may visit this page thinking they will get an answer for the "save as" feature of Emacs, that\'s C-x C-w for an open file.My favorite is the one from Magnars (of emacs rocks screencasts fame.) Unlike the other alternatives, you don\'t have to type the name out from scratch - you get the current name to modify.Thanks to James Yang for a correct version.Here\'s a more robust version adapted from stevey.Here\'s another version, that\'s pretty robust and VC aware:You can read more about it here.based on magnars version, I modified as below, fixed the INIT file name part:There is a way very easy, you press the command M-x and than type vc-rename-file, after that you just need to select your current file at the directory, and than choose the new name. The buff that has the changed file will be refreshed.Source:https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/VC-Delete_002fRename.htmlIt can be achieved by copy. shift+c on the file and emacs will ask you to denote a name for the path including the file name, so you just provide the new name,and enter...of course, you have to Delete the former one.
