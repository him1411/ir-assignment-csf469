I\'m generating some xml files that needs to conform to an xsd file that was given to me.  What\'s the best way to verify they conform?The Java runtime library supports validation. Last time I checked this was the Apache Xerces parser under the covers. You should probably use a javax.xml.validation.Validator.The schema factory constant is the string http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema which defines XSDs. The above code validates a WAR deployment descriptor against the URL http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd but you could just as easily validate against a local file.You should not use the DOMParser to validate a document (unless your goal is to create a document object model anyway). This will start creating DOM objects as it parses the document - wasteful if you aren\'t going to use them.Here\'s how to do it using Xerces2. A tutorial for this, here (req. signup).Original attribution: blatantly copied from here:We build our project using ant, so we can use the schemavalidate task to check our config files:Now naughty config files will fail our build!http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/schemavalidate.htmlI found this site to be helpful, too.http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-javaxmlvalidapi.htmlIt\'s the one that actually worked for me with a minimum of fuss.Using Java 7 you can follow the documentation provided in package description.Since this is a popular question, I would also like to point out that java can validate against a "referred to" xsd, for instance if the .xml file itself specifies an XSD, using xsi:SchemaLocation or xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation (or xsi for particular namespaces) as stated here:or SchemaLocation (always a list of namespace to xsd mappings)"If you create a schema without specifying a URL, file, or source, then the Java language creates one that looks in the document being validated to find the schema it should use. For example:"and this works for multiple namespaces, etc.\nThe problem with this approach is that the xmlsns:xsi is probably a network location, so it\'ll go out and hit the network with each and every validation, not always optimal.Here\'s an example that validates an XML file against any XSD\'s it references (even if it has to pull them from the network):You can avoid pulling referenced XSD\'s from the network, even though the xml files reference url\'s, by specifying the xsd manually (see some other answers here) or by using an "XML catalog" style resolver.  Spring apparently also can intercept the URL requests to serve local files for validations.  Or you can set your own via setResourceResolver, ex:See also here for another tutorial.One more answer: since you said you need to validate files you are generating (writing), you might want to validate content while you are writing, instead of first writing, then reading back for validation. You can probably do that with JDK API for Xml validation, if you use SAX-based writer: if so, just link in validator by calling \'Validator.validate(source, result)\', where source comes from your writer, and result is where output needs to go.Alternatively if you use Stax for writing content (or a library that uses or can use stax), Woodstox http://woodstox.codehaus.org can also directly support validation when using XMLStreamWriter. Here\'s a blog entry showing how that is done:If you are generating XML files programatically, you may want to look at the XMLBeans library. Using a command line tool, XMLBeans will automatically generate and package up a set of Java objects based on an XSD.  You can then use these objects to build an XML document based on this schema.It has built-in support for schema validation, and can convert Java objects to an XML document and vice-versa.Castor and JAXB are other Java libraries that serve a similar purpose to XMLBeans.If you have a Linux-Machine you could use the free command-line tool SAXCount. I found this very usefull.It validates against dtd and xsd.\n5s for a 50MB file.In debian squeeze it is located in the package "libxerces-c-samples".The definition of the dtd and xsd has to be in the xml! You can\'t config them separately.Are you looking for a tool or a library?As far as libraries goes, pretty much the de-facto standard is Xerces2 which has both C++ and Java versions.Be fore warned though, it is a heavy weight solution. But then again, validating XML against XSD files is a rather heavy weight problem.As for a tool to do this for you, XMLFox seems to be a decent freeware solution, but not having used it personally I can\'t say for sure.I had to validate an XML against XSD just one time, so I tried XMLFox. I found it to be very confusing and weird. The help instructions didn\'t seem to match the interface.I ended up using LiquidXML Studio 2008 (v6) which was much easier to use and more immediately familiar (the UI is very similar to Visual Basic 2008 Express, which I use frequently). The drawback: the validation capability is not in the free version, so I had to use the 30 day trial.
