Which is more widely supported: window.onload or document.onload?When do they fire?window.onloaddocument.onloadHow well are they supported?window.onload appears to be the most widely supported. In fact, some of the most modern browsers have in a sense replaced document.onload with window.onload. Browser support issues are most likely the reason why many people are starting to use libraries such as jQuery to handle the checking for the document being ready like so:For the purpose of history:window.onload vs body.onloadAs a note, a similar question was asked on codingforums a while back regarding the usage of window.onload over body.onload. The result seemed to be that you should use window.onload because it is good to separate your structure from the action.The general idea is that window.onload fires when the document\'s window is ready for presentation and document.onload fires when the DOM tree (built from the markup code within the document) is completed.Ideally, subscribing to DOM-tree events, allows offscreen-manipulations through Javascript, incurring almost no CPU load. Contrarily, window.onload can take a while to fire, when multiple external resources have yet to be requested, parsed and loaded.\xe2\x96\xbaTest scenario:To observe the difference and how your browser of choice implements the aforementioned event handlers, simply insert the following code within your document\'s - <body>- tag.\xe2\x96\xbaResult:Here is the resulting behavior, observable for Chrome v20 (and probably most current browsers). \xe2\x96\xbaExample Project:The code above is taken from this project\'s codebase (index.html and keyboarder.js).For a list of event handlers of the window object, please refer to the MDN documentation.According to Parsing HTML documents - The end,The browser parses the HTML source and runs deferred scripts.A DOMContentLoaded is dispatched at the document when all the HTML has been parsed and  have run. The event bubbles to the window.The browser loads resources (like images) that delay the load event.A load event is dispatched at the window.Therefore, the order of execution will beA bubble load event listener (including onload event handler) in document should never be invoked. Only capture load listeners might be invoked, but due to the load of a sub-resource like a stylesheet, not due to the load of the document itself.Add Event ListenerIn Chrome, window.onload is different from <body onload="">, whereas they are the same in both Firefox(version 35.0) and IE (version 11).You could explore that by the following snippet:And you will see both "window loaded"(which comes firstly) and "body onload" in Chrome console. However, you will see just "body onload" in Firefox and IE. If you run "window.onload.toString()" in the consoles of IE & FF, you will see:"function onload(event) { bodyOnloadHandler() }"which means that the assignment "window.onload = function(e)..." is overwritten.window.onload however they are often the same thing.  Similarly body.onload becomes window.onload in IE.window.onload and onunload are shortcuts to document.body.onload and document.body.onunloaddocument.onload and onload handler on all html tag seems to be reserved however never triggered\'onload\' in document -> trueWindow.onload is the standard, however - the web browser in the PS3 (based on Netfront) doesn\'t support the window object, so you can\'t use it there.You also might want to check out jQuery which provides a solid well tested cross browser event model.
