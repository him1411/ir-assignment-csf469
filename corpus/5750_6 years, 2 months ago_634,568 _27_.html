I have the following codeThe input in responsecontent is JSON, but it is not properly parsed into a JSON object. How should I properly serialize it?I am assuming you are not using Json.NET. If this the case, then you should try it.It has the following features:Look at the example below. In this example, JsonConvert class is used to convert an object to and from JSON. It has two static methods for this purpose. They are SerializeObject(Object obj) and DeserializeObject<T>(String json): As was answered here - Deserialize JSON into C# dynamic object?It\'s pretty simple using Json.NET:Or using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq :Here are some options without using third party libraries:See the link for more information about System.Web.Helpers.Json.Update: Nowadays the easiest way to get the Web.Helpers is to use the NuGet package.If you don\'t care about earlier windows versions you can use the classes of the Windows.Data.Json namespace:If .NET 4 is available to you, check out: http://visitmix.com/writings/the-rise-of-json (archive.org)Here is a snippet from that site:That last Console.WriteLine is pretty sweet...Another native solution to this, which doesn\'t require any 3rd party libraries but a reference to System.Web.Extensions is the JavaScriptSerializer. This is not a new but a very unknown built-in features there since 3.5...and backYou could also have a look at the DataContractJsonSerializerThe following from the msdn site should I think help provide some native functionality for what you are looking for. Please note it is specified for Windows 8. One such example from the site is listed below.It utilizes the Windows.Data.JSON namespace.Try the following code:I think the best answer that I\'ve seen has been @MD_Sayem_Ahmed.Your question is "How can I parse Json with C#", but it seems like you are wanting to decode Json.  If you are wanting to decode it, Ahmed\'s answer is good.If you are trying to accomplish this in ASP.NET Web Api, the easiest way is to create a data transfer object that holds the data you want to assign:You have simply add the application/json header to your request (if you are using Fiddler, for example).\nYou would then use this in ASP.NET Web API as follows:This helped me a lot when I was working in my Web Api and made my life super easy.
