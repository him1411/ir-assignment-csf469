I need to open the link in the same parent page, instead of open it in a new page.note : The iframe and parent page are the same domain.I found the best solution was to use the base tag.  Add the following to the head of the page in the iframe:This will load all links on the page in the parent window.  If you want your links to load in a new window, use:This tag is fully supported in all browsers.Use target-attribute:With JavaScript:You can use any optionsin case of only parent page: if you want to open all link into parent page or parent iframe, then you use following code in head section of iframe:<base target="_parent" /> ORif you want to open a specific link into parent page  or parent iframe, then you use following way:ORin case of nested iframe: If want to open all link into browser window (redirect in browser url), then  you use following code in head section of iframe:ORif you want to open a specific link into  browser window (redirect in browser url), then you use following way:orAs noted, you could use a target attribute, but it was technically deprecated in XHTML. That leaves you with using javascript, usually something like parent.window.location.There\'s a DOM Object called base which allows you to: "Specify a default URL and a default target for all links on a page:"by specifying "_blank" you make sure all links inside the iframe will be opened outside.Try target="_parent" attribute inside the anchor tag.The most versatile and most cross-browser solution is to avoid use of the "base" tag, and instead use the target attribute of the "a" tags:The <base> tag is less versatile and browsers are inconsistent in their requirements for its placement within the document, requiring more cross-browser testing. Depending on your project and situation, it can be difficult or even totally unfeasible to achieve the ideal cross-browser placement of the <base> tag.Doing this with the target="_parent" attribute of the <a> tag is not only more browser-friendly, but also allows you to distinguish between those links you want to open in the iframe, and those you want to open in the parent.<a target="parent"> will open links in a new tab/window ... <a target="_parent"> will open links in the parent/current window, without opening new tabs/windows. Don\'t_forget_that_underscore!If you are using iframe in your webpage you might encounter a problem while changing the whole page through a HTML hyperlink (anchor tag) from the iframe.
