This is one of the minor CSS problems that plagues me constantly.  How do folks around StackOverflow vertically align checkboxes and their labels consistently cross-browser?  Whenever I align them correctly in Safari (usually using vertical-align: baseline on the input), they\'re completely off in Firefox and IE.  Fix it in Firefox, and Safari and IE are inevitably messed up. I waste time on this every time I code a form.Here\'s the standard code that I work with:I usually use Eric Meyer\'s reset, so form elements are relatively clean of overrides. Looking forward to any tips or tricks that you have to offer!After over an hour of tweaking, testing, and trying different styles of markup, I think I may have a decent solution.  The requirements for this particular project were:Before I get into any explanation, I\'ll just give you the code:Here is the working example in JSFiddle.This code assumes that you\'re using a reset like Eric Meyer\'s that doesn\'t override form input margins and padding (hence putting margin and padding resets in the input CSS).  Obviously in a live environment you\'ll probably be nesting/overriding stuff to support other input elements, but I wanted to keep things simple.Things to note:Hope this helps someone else!  I haven\'t tried this specific technique on any projects other than the one I was working on this morning, so definitely pipe up if you find something that works more consistently.  Sometimes vertical-align needs two inline (span, label, input, etc...) elements next to each other to work properly. The following checkboxes are properly vertically centered in IE, Safari, FF, and Chrome, even if the text size is very small or large.They all float next to each other on the same line, but the nowrap means that the whole label text always stays next to the checkbox.The downside is the extra meaningless SPAN tags. Now, if you had a very long label text that needed to wrap without wrapping under the checkbox, you\'d use padding and negative text indent on the label elements:Working off of One Crayon\'s solution, I have something that works for me and is simpler:Renders pixel-for-pixel the same in Safari (whose baseline I trust) and both Firefox and IE7 check out as good.  It also works for various label font sizes, big and small. Now, for fixing IE\'s baseline on selects and inputs...One easy thing that seems to work well is to apply a adjust the vertical position of the checkbox with vertical-align.  It will still be vary across browsers, but the solution is uncomplicated.Referencetry vertical-align: middlealso your code seems like it should be:Try my solution, I tried it in IE 6, FF2 and Chrome and it renders pixel by pixel in all the three browsers.The only perfectly working solution for me is:Tested today in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE 7 and 8. Example: FiddleI usually use line height in order to adjust the vertical position of my static text:Hope that helps.I have not completely tested my solution, but it seems to work great.My HTML is simply:I then set all checkboxes to 24px for both height and width. To make the text aligned I make the label\'s line-height also 24px and assign vertical-align: top; like so:EDIT: After IE testing I added vertical-align: bottom; to the input and changed the label\'s CSS. You may find you need a conditional IE css case to sort out padding - but the text and box are inline.If anyone finds that this doesn\'t work, please kindly let me know. Here is it in action (in Chrome and IE - apologies as screenshots were taken on retina and using parallels for IE):\nI think this is the easiest wayFiddleI\'ve never had a problem with doing it like this:This works well for me:Just wanted to add to the discussion about the \'for\' attribute on labels (slightly offtopic):Please do supply it, even when it\'s not necessary, because it\'s so very convenient to use from javascript:That\'s a lot more convenient than trying to figure out wheter the label has the input nested, or wheter the input is before the label, or after.. etc. And it never hurts to supply it.. so.Just my 2 cents.If you use ASP.NET Web Forms you don\'t need to worry about DIVs and other elements or fixed sizes. We can align the <asp:CheckBoxList> text by setting float:left to the CheckboxList input type in CSS.Please check the following example code:.ASPX code:Now that flexbox is supported in all modern browsers, something like this seems like an easier approach to me.\nHere\'s the complete prefixed version demo:I don\'t like relative positioning because it makes element rendered above everything else on its level (it can get on top of something if you have complex layout).I\'ve discovered that vertical-align: sub makes checkboxes look good enough aligned in Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Can\'t check Safari since I don\'t have MacOS and IE10 is slightly off, but I\'ve found it to be good enough solution for me.Another solution might be to try and make specific CSS for every browser and fine-tune it with some vertical-align in %/pixels/EMs:\nhttp://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/browser-specific-hacks/The trick is to use vertical-align only in table cells or inline-block if using label tag.If you\'re using Twitter Bootstrap, you can just use the checkbox class on the <label>:Hardcode the checkbox\'s height and width, remove its padding, and make its height plus vertical margins equal to the label\'s line-height. If the label text is inline, float the checkbox. Firefox, Chrome, and IE7+ all render the following example identically: http://www.kornea.com/css-checkbox-alignWith an input type checkbox wrapped inside the label and floated to the left like so:this worked for me:Make sure the height of the  is identical to the line-height of the (blocklevel) .I usually leave a checkbox unlabeled and then make its "label" a separate element.  It\'s a pain, but there\'s so much cross-browser difference between how checkboxes and their labels are displayed (as you\'ve noticed) that this is the only way I can come close to controlling how everything looks.I also end up doing this in winforms development, for the same reason.  I think the fundamental problem with the checkbox control is that it is really two different controls:  the box and the label.  By using a checkbox, you\'re leaving it up to the implementers of the control to decide how those two elements are displayed next to each other (and they always get it wrong, where wrong = not what you want).I really hope someone has a better answer to your question.CSS:HTML:The above code will place your list items in threecols and just change widths to suit.Yay thanks! This too has been driving me nuts forever. In my particular case, this worked for me:I am using the reset.css which might explain some of the differences, but this seems to work well for me.You should wrap form controls grouped together in their own fieldsets anyways, here, it plays the wrappa. set input/label do display:block, input float left, label float right, set your widths, control spacing with left/right margins, align label text accordingly. soyou probably need to set border, outline and line-height on both as well for cross-browser/media solutions. position: relative; has some issues in IE with z-index and animations like jQuery\'s slideUp/slideDown.CSS:jQuery:The styling probably needs tweaks depending on the font-size used in <label>PS:\nI use ie7js to make the css work in IE6. The chosen answer with 400+ upvotes did not work for me in Chrome 28 OSX, probably because it wasn\'t tested in OSX or that it did work in whatever was around in 2008, when this question was answered.The times have changed, and new CSS3 solutions are now feasible. My solution uses pseudoelements to create a custom checkbox. So the stipulations (pros or cons, however you look at it) are as follows:Your HTML:Your CSS:This solution hides the checkbox, and adds and styles pseudoelements to the label to create the visible checkbox. Because the label is tied to the hidden checkbox, the input field will still get updated and the value will be submitted with the form.jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/SgXYY/6/And if you\'re interested, here\'s my take at radio buttons: http://jsfiddle.net/DtKrV/2/Hope someone finds this useful!So I know this has been answered many times, but I feel I have a way more elegant solution then those that have been provided already. And not only 1 elegant solution, but 2 separate solutions to tickle your fancy. With that said, everything you need to know and see are contained in 2 JS Fiddle\'s, with comments.Solution #1 relies on the native "Checkbox" of the given browser, though with a twist.. Its contained in a div which is easier to position cross browser, with a overflow: hidden to chop the excess of a 1px steched checkbox (this is so you cant see the ugly borders of FF)Simple HTML: (follow the link to review the css with comments, code block is to satisfy stackoverflow) http://jsfiddle.net/KQghJ/Solution #2 uses the "Checkbox Toggle Hack" to toggle the css state of a DIV, which has been properly positioned across browser, and setup with a simple sprite for the checkbox unchecked and checked states. All that is needed is to adjust the background-position with said Checkbox Toggle Hack. This, in my opinion, is the more elegant solution as you have more control over your checkboxes & radios, and can guarantee they look the same across browser.Simple HTML: (follow the link to review the css with comments, code block is to satisfy stackoverflow) http://jsfiddle.net/Sx5M2/If anyone disagree\'s with these methods, please leave me a comment, I would love to hear some feedback on why others have not come across these solutions, or if they have, why I see no answers here regarding them? If anyone sees one of these methods fail, it would be nice to see that too, but these have been tested in the latest browsers and rely on html / css methods that are quite old, and universal as far as I have seen.The following gives pixel-perfect consistency across browsers, even IE9:The approach is quite sensible, to the point of being obvious:This results in a globally applicable general rule:With font size adaptable per form, fieldset or element.Tested in latest Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on Mac, Windows, Iphone, and Android. And IE9.This method is likely applicable to all input types that are not higher than one line of text. Apply a type rule to suit.This is not the best way of going about solving the issueAdding style="position:relative;top:2px;" to the input box would move it down 2px. So depending on your font size, you can move it along.Maybe some folk are making the same mistake I did? Which was... I had set a width for the  input boxes, because they were mostly of type \'text\' , but then forgotten to over-ride that width for checkboxes - so my checkbox was trying to occupy a lot of excess width and so it was tough to align a label beside it.Gives clickable labels and and proper alignment as far back as IE6 (using a class selector) and in late versions of Firefox, Safari and Chrome
