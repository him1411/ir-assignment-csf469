What is the best way to restrict "number"-only input for textboxes?I am looking for something that allows decimal points.I see a lot of examples. But have yet to decide which one to use.Update from Praveen JeganathanNo more plugins, jQuery has implemented its own jQuery.isNumeric() added in v1.7.\nSee: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20186188/66767I\'ve successfully implemented many forms with jquery.numeric plugin.Moreover this works with textareas also!EDIT:- With wider support for newer HTML standards, we can use pattern attribute and number type for input elements to restrict number only input. It works to restrict pasting non-numeric content as well. More information about number and other newer input types is available here.If you want to restrict input (as opposed to validation), you could work with the key events. something like this:And:This immediately lets the user know that they can\'t enter alpha characters, etc. rather than later during the validation phase. You\'ll still want to validate because the input might be filled in by cutting and pasting with the mouse or possibly by a form autocompleter that may not trigger the key events.I thought that the best answer was the one above to just do this.but I agree that it is a bit of a pain that the arrow keys and delete button snap cursor to the end of the string ( and because of that it was kicked back to me in testing)I added in a simple changethis way if there is any button hit that is not going to cause the text to be changed just ignore it.  With this you can hit arrows and delete without jumping to the end but it clears out any non numeric text.The jquery.numeric plugin has some bugs that I notified the author of. It allows multiple decimal points in Safari and Opera, and you can\'t type backspace, arrow keys, or several other control characters in Opera. I needed positive integer input so I ended up just writing my own in the end.No more plugins, jQuery has implemented its own jQuery.isNumeric() added in v1.7.  jQuery.isNumeric( value ) Determines whether its argument is anumber.Here is an example of how to tie the isNumeric() in with the event listenerThe numeric() plugin mentioned above, doesn\'t work in Opera (you can\'t backspace, delete or even use the back or forward keys).The code below in both JQuery or Javascript will work perfectly (and it\'s only two lines).JQuery:Javascript:Of course this is for pure numeric input (plus backspace, delete, forward/back keys) only but can easily be changed to include points and minus characters.You can use the Validation plugin with its number() method.  No need for the long code for number input restriction just try this code.It also accepts valid int & float both values.UPDATEThe above answers are for most common use case - validating input as a number.But below is the code snippet for special use casesBelow is what I use to literally block the keystrokes. This only allows numbers 0-9 and a decimal point. Easy to implement, not a lot of code, and works like a charm:You dont see alphabets magical appearance and disappearance on key down. This works on mouse paste too. As a slight improvement to this suggestion, you can use the Validation plugin with its number(), digits, and range methods. For example, the following ensures you get a positive integer between 0 and 50:I first tried solving this using jQuery, but I wasn\'t happy about unwanted characters (non-digits) actually appearing in the input field just before being removed on keyup. Looking for other solutions I found this:Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers.onkeypress#Example\nLive example: http://jsfiddle.net/u8sZq/To allow a single decimal point you could do something like this:Source: Just wrote this. Seems to be working.\nLive example: http://jsfiddle.net/tjBsF/Some things you could be interested in doing:I know the title asks for jQuery solutions, but hopefully someone will find this useful anyway.Thanks for the post Dave Aaron SmithI edited your answer to accept decimal point and number\'s from number section. This work perfect for me.And apply this on all the inputs you want:HTML5 supports input type number with global browser support 88%+ according to CanIUse as of Oct 2015. This is not JQuery related solution, but the advantage is that on mobile phones Android keyboard will be optimized for entering numbers.Alternatively, it is possible to use input type text with new parameter "pattern". More details in HTML5 spec. I think it is better than jquery solution, since in this question provided jquery solution do not support thousands separator. If you can use html5.JSFiddle:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/p1ue8qxj/This function does the same thing, uses some of the ideas above.You can use autoNumeric from decorplanit.com . They have a nice support for numeric, as well as currency, rounding, etc.I have used in an IE6 environment, with few css tweaks, and it was a reasonable success.For example, a css class numericInput could be defined, and it could be used to decorate your fields with the numeric input masks.adapted from autoNumeric website:/*\nthis is my cross browser version of \nHow to allow only numeric (0-9) in HTML  inputbox using jQuery?\n*/I think this is a good way of solving this problem and it\'s extremely simple:Example: JSFiddleScenarios coveredMost similar recommendations here fail at least one of these or require a lot of code to cover all these scenarios.Scenarios failedPluginI created this simple jquery plugin to make this easier:The best way is to check the contects of the text box whenever it loses focus.You can check whether the contents are a "number" using a regular expression.Or you can use the Validation plugin, which basically does this automatically.Check this find code for Database use:This is a snippet I\'ve just done (using a part of code by Peter Mortensen / Keith Bentrup) for an integer percent validation on a textfield (jQuery is required):This code:I hope this helps those in need.Found a great solution here http://ajax911.com/numbers-numeric-field-jquery/I just changed the "keyup" to "keydown" as per my requirementOther way to keep the caret position on the input:Advantages:Plunker: Demo workingI just found an even better plug-in.\nGives you much more control.\nSay you have a DOB field where you need it be numeric but also accepts "/" or "-" characters.It works great!Check it out at http://itgroup.com.ph/alphanumeric/.Just run the contents through parseFloat(). It will return NaN on invalid input.This code worked pretty good on me, I just had to add the 46 in the controlKeys array to use the period, though I don\'t thinks is the best way to do it ;)I used this,with good results..This is very simple that we have already a javascript inbuilt function "isNaN" is there.The jquery.numeric plugin works well for me too.The only thing I dislike has to do with intuitiveness. Keypresses get \'disallowed\' without any feedback to the user, who might get paranoid or wonder whether his keyboard is broken.I added a second callback to the plugin to make simple feedback on blocked input possible:Just an example (using jQuery UI), of course. Any simple visual feedback would help.
