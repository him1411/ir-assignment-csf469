What are your recommended extensions for Visual Studio 2010?\n(Please indicate if its free or not And also its purpose / function too)NuGetNuGet (formerly NuPack) is a free, open source developer focused package management system for the .NET platform intent on simplifying the process of incorporating third party libraries into a .NET application during development.PowerCommands (free)AnkhSVN (free)Even if you use other SVN shells outside VS (like TortoiseSVN), I recommend to install this Source Control Provider to automatically keep track of file renames, deletions and the like.Visual Assist X(not free)Ghost Doc (Free)It takes a while to configure it properly, but it can be quite useful.From my blog post (all free):DevExpress CodeRush/Refactor! Pro (not free, $249.99)It\'s way better than Resharper (which by the way always slowed down my VS to a crawl), it works with C# and VB.NET (including refactoring) and the support and community is excellent. Worth the price tag. And yes, it does support 2010 (in RC at the time of this writing).Visual Studio Color Theme Editor (free)I can\'t code unless my VS2010 has a StackOverflow-like theme.VisualSVN (not-free)I personally prefer this over AnkhSVN since its not an SCC provider and doesn\'t add extra files to my repository.VisualHG is a Mercurial Source control plugin that drives TortoiseHG from VS. I\'m a big fan of Mercurial & DVCS. VisualHG makes it nice n integrated. Git fans - I\'m not asking for a flame war. Hg is just my brand.VSCommands is simply one of the best FREE plugins ot there!\n(visual studio gallery link)DevExpress CodeRush Xpress (free)tangible T4 Editor plus modeling tools for VS2010 adds IntelliSense and Syntax Coloring to T4 Text Templates (Free)If you are a Vim aficionado...VsVim - free\nViEmu - not free (also not yet released)CodeMaid seems to be pretty useful - it AutoFormats on save which saves a lot of time between developers and code-diffs. (Are there other tools that can use the VS AutoFormat document?)VS10x Code Map\nThat is very cool. Easy jumping to property, method. And easy expand collapse region and more.  ReSharper  (not-free)World of VS Default Browser Switcher for easily switching browser in web projects.Code Contracts Editor Extensions, a free extension which provides information about inherited contracts for the method you\'re currently working on, and a list of contracts for any methods that you\'re calling. Unfortunately, the latter feature conflicts with Resharper, but the former still works fine.RockScroll (free) - Double-click on a word/symbol highlights all occurrences of that word/symbol. Also replaces the scroll bar with a preview of your code, with edit spots and "all occurences" lines highlighted.Example of use: want to see whether a variable is used anywhere else in current source file? Double-click variable, look at scroll bar for any red highlights.AtomineerUtils Pro (not free, $9.99 USD) is, in my opinion, better than Ghost Doc. But, just like Ghost Doc or any automatic documentation generator, the generated documentation is meant to be edited to be of any real value.devColor (Free)Small tool which underlines hex colors in stylesheets with the correct color.  I really like how it integrates into the editor.CleanProject - Cleans Visual Studio SolutionsHow many times have you wanted to send a project to a friend or upload\n  it to a web site like MSDN Code Gallery only to find that your zip\n  file has lots of stuff that you don\'t need to send in it making the\n  file larger than it needs to be.bin folder obj folder TestResults folder Resharper folders And then if\n  you forget about removing Source Control bindings whoever gets your\n  project will be prompted about that.  As someone who does this process\n  a great deal I decided to share with you my code for cleaning a\n  project.I can\'t live without DPack - especially when working on large projects, makes navigating between files and members much easier. And it\'s free.Favorite shortucts:Alt+U : file browser, filters files as you type\nAlt+G : code browser, filters all members as you type\nAlt+M : code browser, filters methods in the current file as you type  ...and so on. Much easier for me then finding my way around Project Explorer.Vingy (Free)Vingy 1.0 is simple, but effective add in for Visual Studio 2010 so that you can search the web in a non intrusive way, and can filter results based on sources.Vingy http://lh4.ggpht.com/__Mw4iY-4nuY/TKic0LcfKgI/AAAAAAAAA7s/OR82RFQFSU8/s1600-h/image%5B14%5D.pngYou can bring up Vingy either by clicking View->Other Windows \xe2\x80\x93> Vingy Search Window from the Visual Studio IDE, or just by high lighting some text in the document and then clicking Tools \xe2\x80\x93> Search Selected Text (Ctrl + 1).Searching with Vingy is pretty straight forward. You can initiate a Search in two ways.This is my list of extensions.The list on this is pretty comprehensive, so I spent sometime to find the extensions that I need. Here is the snapshot. Hope it will help someone.\nI tried installing Codemaid, and it appeared to be a nifty addon, but my Visual Studio response became very slow. Felt like some threads were doing some work all the time when Codemaid was on.\nSo uninstalling for now.VSFileNav - (Free) A Find File in Solution tool (cross between SonicFileFinder and Resharper). Lightweight, easy to use and fast (I got sick of the huge startup time with Sonic).Disclaimer : I wrote this tool.Plugin to quickly go to any file in solution\nSonic file finder (free)Fast switching between .h and .cpp file\nMacro available here (free)And that\'s it =)WoVS Quick Add ReferenceThe \xe2\x80\x9cQuick Add Reference\xe2\x80\x9d extension augments the smart tag that VS shows for unrecognized types giving you a chance to add the corresponding assembly reference for that type plus corresponding \xe2\x80\x9cusing\xe2\x80\x9d clause if needed in a single shot.
