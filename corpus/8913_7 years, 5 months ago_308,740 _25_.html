This question already has an answer here:Given  file names like these:I hope to getWhy this doesn\'t work?What\'s the right way to do it?You don\'t have to call the external basename command. Instead, you could use the following commands:Note that this solution should work in all recent (post 2004) POSIX compliant shells, (e.g. bash, dash, ksh, etc.).Source: Shell Command Language 2.6.2 Parameter ExpansionMore on bash String Manipulations:  http://tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue18/bash.htmlThe basename command has two different invocations; in one, you specify just the path, in which case it gives you the last component, while in the other you also give a suffix that it will remove. So, you can simplify your example code by using the second invocation of basename. Also, be careful to correctly quote things:A combination of basename and cut works fine, even in case of double ending like .tar.gz:Would be interesting if this solution needs less arithmetic power than Bash Parameter Expansion.Here is another (more complex) way of getting either the filename or extension, first use the rev command to invert the file path, cut from the first . and then invert the file path again, like this:Pure bash, no basename, no variable juggling.  Set a string and echo:Output:Note: the bash extglob option must be "on", (on Ubuntu it\'s "on" by default), if it\'s not, do:Walking through the ${s//+(*\\/|.*)}:Relevant man bash background:Here are oneliners:I needed this, the same as asked by bongbang and w4etwetewtwet.If you want to play nice with Windows file paths (under Cygwin) you can also try this:This will account for backslash separators when using BaSH on Windows.Just an alternative that I came up with to extract an extension, using the posts in this thread with my own small knowledge base that was more familiar to me.Note: Please advise on my use of quotes; it worked for me but I might be missing something on their proper use (I probably use too many).Use the basename command.
