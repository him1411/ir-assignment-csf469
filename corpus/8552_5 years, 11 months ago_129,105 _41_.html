I know this will work:But if I want to callI find some methods to make Foo.talk work, Is there some other ways to do this? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it is right to do so. Do you use class methods or static methods in your JavaScript code?First off, remember that JavaScript is primarily a prototypal language, rather than a class-based language1. Foo isn\'t a class, it\'s a function, which is an object. You can instantiate an object from that function using the new keyword which will allow you to create something similar to a class in a standard OOP language.I\'d suggest ignoring __proto__ most of the time because it has poor cross browser support, and instead focus on learning about how prototype works.If you have an instance of an object created from a function2 and you access one of its members (methods, attributes, properties, constants etc) in any way, the access will flow down the prototype hierarchy until it either (a) finds the member, or (b) doesn\'t find another prototype.The hierarchy starts on the object that was called, and then searches it\'s prototype object. If the prototype object has a prototype, it repeats, if no prototype exists, undefined is returned.For example:It looks to me like you\'ve at least somewhat understood these "basic" parts already, but I need to make them explicit just to be sure.In JavaScript, everything is an object3.everything is an object.function Foo(){} doesn\'t just define a new function, it defines a new function object that can be accessed using Foo.This is why you can access Foo\'s prototype with Foo.prototype.What you can also do is set more functions on Foo:This new function can be accessed using:I hope by now you\'re noticing a similarity between functions on a function object and a static method.Think of f = new Foo(); as creating a class instance, Foo.prototype.bar = function(){...} as defining a shared method for the class, and Foo.baz = function(){...} as defining a public static method for the class.1: class was a "Future Reserved Word" in the ECMAScript 5 specification, but ES6 introduces the ability to define classes using the class keyword.2: essentially a class instance created by a constructor, but there are many nuanced differences that I don\'t want to mislead you3: primitive values—which include undefined, null, booleans, numbers, and strings—aren\'t technically objects because they\'re low-level language implementations. Booleans, numbers, and strings still interact with the prototype chain as though they were objects, so for the purposes of this answer, it\'s easier to consider them "objects" even though they\'re not quite.You can achieve it as below:You can now invoke "talk" function as below:You can do this because in JavaScript, functions are objects as well. "zzzzBov" has answered it as well but it\'s a lengthy read.Call a static method from an instance:Simple Javascript Class Project: https://github.com/reduardo7/sjsClassHere is a good example to demonstrate how Javascript works with static/instance variables and methods.In additions, now it is possible to do with class and staticwill give I use namespaces: And to use it:Or ES6 supports now class & static keywords like a charm : When you try to call Foo.talk, the JS tries to search a function talk through __proto__ and, of course, it can\'t be found.Foo.__proto__ is Function.prototype.If you have to write static methods in ES5 I found a great tutorial for that:see @https://abdulapopoola.com/2013/03/30/static-and-instance-methods-in-javascript/In your case, you could define methods in class function:Further, Define after class function as a static class:Finally, My static class way:https://github.com/yidas/js-design-patterns/tree/master/class
