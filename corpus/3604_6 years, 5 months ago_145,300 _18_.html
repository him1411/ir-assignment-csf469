I need to remove spaces from the end of a string. How can I do that?\nExample: if string is "Hello    " it must become "Hello"Use -stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:(This will trim whitespace characters on both ends).Swift 3Another solution involves creating mutable string:Here you go...So now just call it. Supposing you have a string that has spaces on the front and spaces on the end and you just want to remove the spaces on the end, you can call it like this:resultString will then have no spaces at the end.To remove whitespace from only the beginning and end of a string in Swift:Swift versionOnly trims spaces at the end of the String:Trims spaces on both sides of the String:This will remove only the trailing characters of your choice.There are many other CharacterSets. Check it yourself as per your requirement.In SwiftTo trim space & newline from both side of the String:I came up with this function, which basically behaves similarly to one in the answer by Alex:whitespaceCharacterSet besides space itself includes also tab character, which in my case could not appear. So i guess a plain comparison could suffice.
