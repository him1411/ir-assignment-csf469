I have a navigation based application and I want to change the animation of the push and pop animations. How would I do that?I did the following and it works fine.. and is simple and easy to understand..And the same thing for push..Swift 3.0 version:This is how I\'ve always managed to complete this task.For Push:For Pop:\nI still get a lot of feedback from this so I\'m going to go ahead and update it to use animation blocks which is the Apple recommended way to do animations anyway.\n\nFor Push:For Pop:for pushfor pop@Magnus answer, only then for Swift (2.0)Some sidenotes:You can do this as well with Segue, just implement this in prepareForSegue or shouldPerformSegueWithIdentifier. However, this will keep the default animation in it as well. To fix this you have to go to the storyboard, click the Segue, and uncheck the box \'Animates\'. But this will limit your app for IOS 9.0 and above (atleast when I did it in Xcode 7).When doing in a segue, the last two lines should be replaced with:Even though I set false, it kind of ignores it.Using private calls is a bad idea as Apple no longer approve apps that do that.\nMaybe you could try this:Remember that in Swift,  extension are definitely your friends! I recently was trying to do something similar.  I decided I didn\'t like the sliding animation of the UINavigationController, but I also didn\'t want to do the animations that UIView gives you like curl or anything like that.  I wanted to do a cross fade between the views when I push or pop.  The problem there involves the fact that the view is literally removing the view or popping one over the top of the current one, so a fade doesn\'t work.  The solution I came to involved taking my new view and adding it as a subview to the current top view on the UIViewController\'s stack.  I add it with an alpha of 0, then do a crossfade.  When the animation sequence finishes, I push the view onto the stack without animating it.  I then go back to the old topView and clean up stuff that I had changed.Its a little more complicated than that, because you have the navigationItems you have to adjust to make the transition look correct.  Also, if you do any rotation, you then have to adjust frame sizes as you add the views as subviews so they show up correctly on screen.  Here is some of the code I used.  I subclassed the UINavigationController and overrode the push and the pop methods.As I mention in the code, I always have a left bar button item, so I don\'t check to see if it is nil before putting it in the array that I pass as the context for the animation delegate.  If you do this, you may want to make that check.  The problem I found was that if you crash at all in the delegate method, it won\'t crash the program.  It just stops the delegate from completing but you don\'t get any kind of warning.\nSo since I was doing my cleanup in that delegate routine, it was causing some weird visual behavior since it wasn\'t finishing the cleanup.The back button I create calls a "goBack" method, and that method just calls the pop routine.Also, here is my pop routine.That\'s pretty much it.  You\'ll need some additional code if you want to implement rotations.  You\'ll need to set the frame size of your views that you add as subviews before you show them otherwise you\'ll run into issues the orientation is landscape, but the last time you saw the previous view it was portrait.  So, then you add it as a sub view and fade it in but it shows up as portrait, then when we pop without animation, the same view, but the one that is in the stack, now is landscape.  The whole thing looks a little funky.  Everyone\'s implementation of rotation is a little different so I didn\'t include my code for that here.Hope it helps some people.  I\'ve looked all over for something like this and couldn\'t find anything.  I don\'t think this is the perfect answer, but it is working real well for me at this point.There are UINavigationControllerDelegate and UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning there you can change animation for anything you want.For example this is vertical pop animation for VC:}And thenUseful tutorial\nhttps://www.objc.io/issues/5-ios7/view-controller-transitions/Since this is the top result on Google I thought I\'d share what I think is the most sane way; which is to use the iOS 7+ transitioning API. I implemented this for iOS 10 with Swift 3.It\'s pretty simple to combine this with how UINavigationController animates between two view controllers if you create a subclass of UINavigationController and return an instance of a class that conforms to the UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning protocol.For example here is my UINavigationController subclass:You can see that I set the UINavigationControllerDelegate to itself, and in an extension on my subclass I implement the method in UINavigationControllerDelegate that allows you to return a custom animation controller (i.e., NavigationControllerAnimation). This custom animation controller will replace the stock animation for you.You\'re probably wondering why I pass in the operation to the NavigationControllerAnimation instance via its initializer. I do this so that in NavigationControllerAnimation\'s implementation of the UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning protocol I know what the operation is (i.e., \'push\' or \'pop\'). This helps to know what kind of animation I should do. Most of the time, you want to perform a different animation depending on the operation.The rest is pretty standard. Implement the two required functions in the UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning protocol and animate however you like:It\'s important to remember, that for each different type of operation (i.e., \'push\' or \'pop), the to and from view controllers will be different. When you are in a push operation, the to view controller will be the one being pushed. When you are in a pop operation, the to view controller will be the one that is being transitioned to, and the from view controller will be the one that\'s being popped.Also, the to view controller must be added as a subview of the containerView in the transition context.When your animation completes, you must call transitionContext.completeTransition(true). If you are doing an interactive transition, you will have to dynamically return a Bool to completeTransition(didComplete: Bool), depending on if the transition is complete at the end of the animation.Finally (optional reading), you might want to see how I did the transition I was working on. This code is a bit more hacky and I wrote it pretty quickly so I wouldn\'t say it\'s great animation code but it still shows how to do the animation part.Mine was a really simple transition; I wanted to mimic the same animation that UINavigationController typically does, but instead of the \'next page over the top\' animation it does, I wanted to implement a 1:1 animation of the old view controller away at the same time as the new view controller appears. This has the effect of making the two view controllers seem as though they are pinned to each other.For the push operation, that requires first setting the toViewController\'s view origin on the x\xe2\x80\x93axis off screen, adding it as the subview of the containerView, animating it onto screen by setting that origin.x to zero. At the same time, I animate the fromViewController\'s view away by setting its origin.x off the screen: The pop operation is basically the inverse. Add the toViewController as a subview of the containerView, and animate away the fromViewController to the right as you animate in the toViewController from the left:Here\'s a gist with the whole swift file:https://gist.github.com/alanzeino/603293f9da5cd0b7f6b60dc20bc766beHere is how I have done the same in Swift:For Push:For Pop:I actually did this a little differently to some of the responses above - but as I am new to Swift development, it might not be right. I have overridden viewWillDisappear:animated: and added the pop code in there:Using iJordan\'s answer as inspiration, why not simply create a Category on UINavigationController to use throughout your app instead of copying/pasting this animation code all over the place?UINavigationController+Animation.hUINavigationController+Animation.mThen simply import the UINavigationController+Animation.h file and call it normally:While all the answers here are great and most work very well, there is a slightly simpler method which achieves the same effect...For Push:For Pop:I am not aware of any way you can change the transition animation publicly. If the "back" button is not necessary you should use modal view controllers to have the "push from bottom" / "flip" / "fade" / (\xe2\x89\xa53.2)"page curl" transitions.On the private side, the method -pushViewController:animated: calls the undocumented method -pushViewController:transition:forceImmediate:, so e.g. if you want a flip-from-left-to-right transition, you can useYou can\'t change the "pop" transition this way, however.See my answer to this question for a way to do it in far fewer lines of code. This method allows you to animate a pseudo-"Push" of a new view controller any way you like, and when the animation is done it sets up the Navigation Controller just as if you had used the standard Push method. My example lets you animate either a slide-in from the left or from the right.\nCode repeated here for convenience:Have a look at ADTransitionController, a drop in replacement for UINavigationController with custom transition animations (its API matches the API of UINavigationController) that we created at Applidium. You can use different pre-defined animations for push and pop actions such as Swipe, Fade, Cube, Carrousel, Zoom and so on.See my more detailed answer, using only public methods, here:Prevent the animation when clicking "Back" button in a navigation bar?...it\'s imperfect (it means re-implementing some of UINavigationController) - but it doesn\'t use any private methods, and it works.From the sample app, check out this variation.\nhttps://github.com/mpospese/MPFoldTransition/Just use:Realising this is an old question. I still would like to post this answer, as I had some problems popping several viewControllers with the proposed answers. My solution is to subclass UINavigationController and override all the pop and push methods.FlippingNavigationController.hFlippingNavigationController.m:I found a mildly recursive way to do this that works for my purposes. I have an instance variable BOOL that I use to block the normal popping animation and substitute my own non-animated pop message. The variable is initially set to NO. When the back button is tapped, the delegate method sets it to YES and sends a new non-animated pop message to the nav bar, thereby calling the same delegate method again, this time with the variable set to YES. With the variable is set to YES, the delegate method sets it to NO and returns YES to allow the non-animated pop occur. After the second delegate call returns, we end up back in the first one, where NO is returned, blocking the original animated pop! It\'s actually not as messy as it sounds. My shouldPopItem method looks like this:Works for me.You can now use UIView.transition. Note that animated:false. This works with any transition option, pop, push, or stack replace.
