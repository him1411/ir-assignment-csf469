This question already has an answer here:What\'s the place for the default parameter value? Just in function definition, or declaration, or both places?Default parameter values must appear on the declaration, since that is the only thing that the caller sees.EDIT: As others point out, you can have the argument on the definition, but I would advise writing all code as if that wasn\'t true.You can do either, but never both. Usually you do it at function declaration and then all callers can use that default value. However you can do that at function definition instead and then only those who see the definition will be able to use the default value.The most useful place is in the declaration (.h) so that all users will see it. Some people like to add the default values in the implementation too (as a comment):However, this means duplication and will add the possibility of having the comment out of sync with the code (what\'s worse than uncommented code? code with misleading comments!).Although this is an "old" thread, I still would like to add the following to it:I\'ve experienced the next case:As one can see, I had put the default value of the parameter "force" in the class source file, not in the class header file.Then I used that function in a derived class as follows (derived class inherited the base class in a public way):SetI2cSlaveAddress( addr );assuming it would take the "force" parameter as "false" \'for granted\'.However, the compiler (put in c++11 mode) complained and gave me the following compiler error:But when I added the default parameter in the header file of the base class:int SetI2cSlaveAddress( UCHAR addr, bool force = false );and removed it from the source file of the base class:int CI2cHal::SetI2cSlaveAddress( UCHAR addr, bool force )then the compiler was happy and all code worked as expected (I could give one or two parameters to the function SetI2cSlaveAddress())!So, not only for the user of a class it\'s important to put the default value of a parameter in the header file, also compiling and functional wise it apparently seems to be a must!If the functions are exposed - non-member, public or protected - then the caller should know about them, and the default values must be in the header.If the functions are private and out-of-line, then it does make sense to put the defaults in the implementation file because that allows changes that don\'t trigger client recompilation (a sometimes serious issue for low-level libraries shared in enterprise scale development).  That said, it is definitely potentially confusing, and there is documentation value in presenting the API in a more intuitive way in the header, so pick your compromise - though consistency\'s the main thing when there\'s no compelling reason either way.the declaration is generally the most \'useful\', but that depends on how you want to use the class.both is not valid.Good question...\nI find that coders typically use the declaration to declare defaults. I\'ve been held to one way (or warned) or the other too based on the compilerOne more point I haven\'t found anyone mentioned:If you have virtual method, each declaration can have its own default value!It depends on the interface you are calling which value will be used.Example on ideoneIt prints 50I strongly discourage you to use it like thisYou may do in either (according to standard), but remember, if your code is seeing the declaration without default argument(s) before the definition that contains default argument, then compilation error can come.For example, if you include header containing function declaration without default argument list, thus compiler will look for that prototype as it is unaware of your default argument values and hence prototype won\'t match.If you are putting function with default argument in definition, then include that file but I won\'t suggest that.Adding one more point. Function declarations with default argument should be ordered from right to left and from top to bottom.For example in the below function declaration if you change the declaration order then the compiler gives you a missing default parameter error.  Reason the compiler allows you to separate the function declaration with default argument within the same scope but it should be in order from RIGHT to LEFT (default arguments) and from TOP to BOTTOM(order of function declaration default argument).
