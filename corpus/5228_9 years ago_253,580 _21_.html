What is the highest port number one can use?The port number is an unsigned 16-bit integer, so 65535.The largest port number is an unsigned short 2^16-1: 65535A registered port is one assigned by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to a certain use. Each registered port is in the range 1024\xe2\x80\x9349151.Since 21 March 2001 the registry agency is ICANN; before that time it was IANA.Ports with numbers lower than those of the registered ports are called well known ports; port with numbers greater than those of the registered ports are called dynamic and/or private ports.SourceAs I understand it, you should only use up to 49151, as from 49152 up to 65535 are reserved for Ephemeral portsJust a followup to smashery\'s answer. The ephemeral port range (on Linux at least, and I suspect other Unices as well) is not a fixed. This can be controlled by writing to \n/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_rangeThe only restriction (as far as IANA is concerned) is that ports below 1024 are designated to be well-known ports. Ports above that are free for use.\nOften you\'ll find that ports below 1024 are restricted to superuser access, I believe for this very reason.It depends on which range you\'re talking about, but the dynamic range goes up to 65535 or 2^16-1 (16 bits).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbersIt should be 65535.According to RFC 793, the port is a 16 bit unsigned int.This means the range is 0 - 65535.However, within that range, ports 0 - 1023 are generally reserved for specific purposes. I say generally because, apart from port 0, there is usually no enforcement of the 0-1023 reservation. TCP/UDP implementations usually don\'t enforce reservations apart from 0. You can, if you want to, run up a web server\'s TLS port on port 80, or 25, or 65535 instead of the standard 443. Likewise, even tho it is the standard that SMTP servers listen on port 25, you can run it on 80, 443, or others.Most implementations reserve 0 for a specific purpose - random port assignment. So in most implementations, saying "listen on port 0" actually means "I don\'t care what port I use, just give me some random unassigned port to listen on".So any limitation on using a port in the 0-65535 range, including 0, ephemeral reservation range etc, is implementation (i.e. OS/driver) specific, however all, including 0, are valid ports in the RFC 793.by numerical term it is 2^16 - 1 so allowed range is 65535Allowed Range is 1 to 65535, thus highest being 65535Numerically it should be 2^16 - 1 so allowed range is 65535.
