I\'m new to git and I\'m trying to understand the difference between a squash and a rebase.  As I understand it you perform a squash when doing a rebase.Both git merge --squash and git rebase --interactive can produce a "squashed" commit.\nBut they serve different purposes.will produce a squashed commit on the destination branch, without marking any merge relationship.\n(Note: it does not produce a commit right away: you need an additional git commit -m "squash branch")\nThis is useful if you want to throw away the source branch completely, going from (schema taken from SO question):to:and then deleting tmp branch.replays some or all of your commits on a new base, allowing you to squash (or more recently "fix up", see this SO question), going directly to:If you choose to squash all commits of tmp (but, contrary to merge --squash, you can choose to replay some, and squashing others).  So the differences are:Merge squash merges a tree (a sequence of commits) into a single commit. That is, it squashes all changes made in n commits into a single commit.Rebasing is re-basing, that is, choosing a new base (parent commit) for a tree. Maybe the mercurial term for this is more clear: they call it transplant because it\'s just that: picking a new ground (parent commit, root) for a tree.When doing an interactive rebase, you\'re given the option to either squash, pick, edit or skip the commits you are going to rebase.Hope that was clear!Merge commits: retains all of the commits in your branch and interleaves them with commits on the base branchMerge Squash: retains the changes but omits the individual commits from history\nRebase: This moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the master branch, effectively incorporating all of the new commits in masterMore on here
