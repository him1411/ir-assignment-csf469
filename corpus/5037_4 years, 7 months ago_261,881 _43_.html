I know there are lot of questions of this nature but I need to do this using JavaScript. I am using Dojo 1.8 and have all the attribute info in array, which looks like this:Any idea how I can export this to CSV on the client side?You can do this in native JavaScript. You\'ll have to parse your data into correct CSV format as so (assuming you are using an array of arrays for your data as you have described in the question):Then you can use JavaScript\'s window.open and encodeURI functions to download the CSV file like so:Based on the answers above I created this function that I have tested on IE 11, Chrome 36 and Firefox 29 For example:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/jossef/m3rrLzk0/This solution should work with Internet Explorer 10+, Edge, old and new versions of Chrome, FireFox, Safari, ++The accepted answer won\'t work with IE and Safari.Running the code snippet will download the mock data as csvCredits to dandavis https://stackoverflow.com/a/16377813/1350598I came here looking for a bit more RFC 4180 compliance and I failed to find an implementation, so I made a (possibly inefficient) one for my own needs.  I thought I would share it with everyone.Hopefully this will help someone out in the future.  This combines both the encoding of the CSV along with the ability to download the file.  In my example on jsfiddle. You can download the file (assuming HTML 5 browser) or view the output in the console.UPDATE:Chrome now appears to have lost the ability to name the file.  I\'m not sure what\'s happened or how to fix it, but whenever I use this code (including the jsfiddle), the downloaded file is now named download.csv.The solution from @Default works perfect on Chrome (thanks a lot for that!) but I had a problem with IE.Here\'s a solution (works on IE10):In Chrome 35 update, download attribute behavior was changed.https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=373182to work this in chrome, use this There you go : Create a blob with the csv data .ie var blob = new Blob([data], type:"text/csv");If the browser supports saving of blobs i.e if window.navigator.mSaveOrOpenBlob)===true, then save the csv data using:  window.navigator.msSaveBlob(blob, \'filename.csv\')If the browser doesn\'t support saving and opening of blobs, then save csv data as: Full Code snippet:Then : In case anyone needs this for reactjs, react-csv is there for that There are two questions here:All the answers to the first question (except the one by Milimetric) here seem like an overkill. And the one by Milimetric does not cover altrenative requirements, like surrounding strings with quotes or converting arrays of objects. Here are my takes on this:For a simple csv one map() and a join() are enough:This method also allows you to specify column separator other than a comma in the inner join. for example a tab: d.join(\'\\t\')On the other hand if you want to do it properly and enclose strings in quotes "", then you can use some JSON magic:if you have array of objects like :Here\'s how I download CSV files on the client side in my Java GWT application. Special thanks to Xavier John for his solution.  It\'s been verified to work in FF 24.6.0, IE 11.0.20, and Chrome 45.0.2454.99 (64-bit). I hope this saves someone a bit of time:Here\'s an Angular friendly version:In case anyone needs this for knockout js, it works ok with basically the proposed solution:html:view model:I added to Xavier Johns function to also include the field headers if needed, uses jQuery though. The $.each bit will need changing for a native javascript loopThis is a modified answer based on the accepted answer wherein the data would be coming from JSON.The answers above work, but keep in mind that if you are opening up in the .xls format, columns will be separated by \'\\t\' instead of \',\', the answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/14966131/6169225 worked well for me, so long as I used .join(\'\\t\') on the arrays instead of .join(\',\').
