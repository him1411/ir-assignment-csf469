I\'m just getting started learning SQLite. It would be nice to be able to see the details for a table, like MySQL\'s DESCRIBE [table]. PRAGMA table_info [table] isn\'t good enough, as it only has basic information (for example, it doesn\'t show if a column is a field of some sort or not). Does SQLite have a way to do this?The SQLite command line utility has a .schema TABLENAME command that shows you the create statements.Are you looking for the SQL used to generate a table?  For that, you can query the sqlite_master table:To see all tables:To see a particular table:To prevent that people are mislead by some of the comments to the other answers:... .schema can only be used from a command line; the above commands > can be run as a query through a library (Python, C#, etc.). \xe2\x80\x93  Mark Rushakoff Jul 25 \'10 at 21:09 (Put up as answer as no permission to comment yet.)
