I want to select all the elements that have the two classes a and b.So, only the elements that have both classes.When I use $(".a, .b") it gives me the union, but I want the intersection.If you want an intersection, just write the selectors together without spaces in between. So for an element that has an ID of a with classes b and c, you would write:You can do this using the filter() function:For the caseYou would need to put a space in between .a and .b.cThe problem you\'re having, is that you are using a Group Selector, whereas you should be using a Multiples selector! To be more specific, you\'re using $(\'.a, .b\') whereas you should be using $(\'.a.b\').For more information, see the overview of the different ways to combine selectors herebelow!Select all <h1> elements AND all <p> elements AND all <a> elements :Select all <input> elements of type text, with classes code and red :Select all <i> elements inside <p> elements: Select all <ul> elements that are immediate children of a <li> element:Select all <a> elements that are placed immediately after <h2> elements:Select all <span> elements that are siblings of <div> elements: Vanilla JavaScript solution:-document.querySelectorAll(\'.a.b\')Just mention another case with element:E.g. <div id="title1" class="A B C">Just type: $("div#title1.A.B.C")For better performance you can useThis will look only through the div elements instead of stepping through all the html elements that you have on your page.Group SelectorBecomes this:So in your case you have tried the group selector whereas its an intersectioninstead use this
