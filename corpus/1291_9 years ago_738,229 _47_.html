I want to put a copyright notice in the footer of a web site, but I think it\'s incredibly tacky for the year to be out-of-date. How would I make the year update automatically with PHP 4 and PHP 5?You can use either date or strftime. In this case I\'d say it doesn\'t matter as a year is a year, no matter what (unless there\'s a locale that formats the year differently?)For example:On a side note, when formatting dates in PHP it matters when you want to format your date in a different locale than your default. If so, you have to use setlocale and strftime. According to the php manual on date:To format dates in other languages,\n  you should use the setlocale() and\n  strftime()  functions instead of\n  date().From this point of view, I think it would be best to use strftime as much as possible, if you even have a remote possibility of having to localize your application. If that\'s not an issue, pick the one you like best.My super lazy version of showing a copyright line, that automatically stays updated:This year (2008), it will say:© 2008 Me, Inc.Next year, it will say:© 2008-2009 Me, Inc.and forever stay updated with the current year.Or (PHP 5.3.0+) a compact way to do it using an anonymous function so you don\'t have variables leaking out and don\'t repeat code/constants:With PHP heading in a more object-oriented direction, I\'m surprised nobody here has referenced the built-in DateTime class:or one-liner with class member access on instantiation (php>=5.4):http://us2.php.net/dateI love strftime.  It\'s a great function for grabbing/recombining chunks of dates/times. Plus it respects locale settings which the date function doesn\'t do.This one gives you the local time:And this one UTC:For 4 digit representation:2 digit representation:Check the php documentation for more info:\nhttps://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.date.phpHere\'s what I do: below is a bit of explanation of what it does: Y will gives you four digit (e.g. 1990) and y for two digit (e.g. 90)echo date(\'Y\') gives you current year, and this will update automatically since date() give us the current date.For more information, check date() function documentation: https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.date.phpJust write:Or:And \'echo\' this value...use a PHP function which is just called date().It takes the current date and then you provide a format to itand the format is just going to be Y. Capital Y is going to be a four digit year.a shorthand php code to output the current yearIf your server supports Short Tags, or you use PHP 5.4, you can use:You can use the simple PHP date class. It provides many useful methods and functions:You can check the library tutorials page for more examples BTW... there are a few proper ways how to display site copyright. Some people have tendency to make things redundant i.e.: Copyright \xc2\xa9 have both the same meaning. The important copyright parts are:Using PHP + HTML:orFor up to php 5.4+Or you can use it with one lineIf you wanna increase or decrease the year another method; add modify line like below.You can use this in footer sections to get dynamic copyright yearGet full Year used:Or get only two digit of year used like this:
