I need a way to recursively delete a folder and its children, is there a prebuilt tool for this, or do I need to write one?DEL /S doesn\'t delete directories.DELTREE was removed from Windows 2000+RMDIR or RD if you are using the classic Command Prompt (cmd.exe):If you are using PowerShell you can use Remove-Item (which is aliased to del, erase, rd, ri, rm and rmdir) and takes a -Recurse argument that can be shorted to -radmin:Works for anything including sys filesEDIT: I actually found the best way which also solves file path too long problem as well:RMDIR [/S] [/Q] [drive:]pathRD [/S] [/Q] [drive:]path/S      Removes all directories and files in the specified directory in addition to the directory itself.  Used to remove a directory tree./Q      Quiet mode, do not ask if ok to remove a directory tree with /SYou can install cygwin, which has rm as well as ls etc.Go to the path and trigger this command./s : Removes the specified directory and all subdirectories including any files. Use /s to remove a tree./q : Runs rmdir in quiet mode. Deletes directories without confirmation./? : Displays help at the command prompt.rmdir /S /Q %DIRNAME%rmdir /s dirnameTry this command:You can install GnuWin32 and use *nix commands natively on windows. I install this before I install anything else on a minty fresh copy of windows. :)Here is what you need to do...Create a batch file with the following lineRMDIR /S %1Save your batch file as Remove.bat and put it in C:\\windowsCreate the following registry keyHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\shell\\Remove Directory (RMDIR)Launch regedit and update the default value HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\shell\\Remove Directory (RMDIR)\\default\nwith the following value"c:\\windows\\REMOVE.bat" "%1"Thats it! Now you can right click any directory and use the RMDIR functionFor deleting a directory (whether or not it exists) use the following:There is also deltree if you\'re on an older version of windows.I really like this site for finding commands:\nSS64: Del - Delete Fileshere is what worked for me:Just try decreasing the length of the path. \ni.e :: Rename all folders that lead to such a file to smallest possible names. Say one letter names. Go on renaming upwards in the folder hierarchy.\nBy this u effectively reduce the path length.\nNow finally try deleting the file straight away.First, let\xe2\x80\x99s review what rm -rf does:There are three scenarios where rm -rf is commonly used where it is expected to return 0:I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ignore the whole permissions thing, but nobody uses permissions or tries to deny themselves write access on things in Windows anyways (OK, that\xe2\x80\x99s meant to be a joke\xe2\x80\xa6).First set ERRORLEVEL to 0 and then delete the path only if it exists, using different commands depending on whether or not it is a directory. IF EXIST does not set ERRORLEVEL to 0 if the path does not exist, so setting the ERRORLEVEL to 0 first is necessary to properly detect success in a way that mimics normal rm -rf usage. Guarding the RD with IF EXIST is necessary because RD, unlike rm -f, will throw an error if the target does not exist.The following script snippet assumes that DELPATH is prequoted. (This is safe when you do something like SET DELPATH=%1. Try putting ECHO %1 in a .cmd and passing it an argument with spaces in it and see what happens for yourself). After the snippet completes, you can check for failure with IF ERRORLEVEL 1.Point is, everything is simpler when the environment just conforms to POSIX. Or if you install a minimal MSYS and just use that.del /s /q directorytobedeletedhttp://www.computerhope.com/delhlp.htm
