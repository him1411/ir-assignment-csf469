What\'s the best way to break from nested loops in Javascript?Just like Perl,as defined in EMCA-262 section 12.12. [MDN Docs]Unlike C, these labels can only be used for continue and break, as Javascript does not have goto (without hacks like this).Wrap that up in a function and then just return.I\'m a little late to the party but the following is a language-agnostic approach which doesn\'t use GOTO/labels or function wrapping:On the upside it flows naturally which should please the non-GOTO crowd. On the downside, the inner loop needs to complete the current iteration before terminating so it might not be applicable in some scenarios.I realize this is a really old topic, but since my standard approach is not here yet, I thought I post it for the future googlers.How\'s that? :)quite simpleHow about using no breaks at all, no abort flags, and no extra condition checks. This version just blasts the loop variables (makes them Number.MAX_VALUE) when the condition is met and forces all the loops to terminate elegantly.There was a similar-ish answer for decrementing-type nested loops, but this works for incrementing-type nested loops without needing to consider each loop\'s termination value for simple loops.Another example:If you use Coffeescript, there is a convenient "do" keyword that makes it easier to define and immediately execute an anonymous function:...so you can simply use "return" to get out of the loops.I thought I\'d show a functional-programming approach. You can break out of nested Array.prototype.some() and/or Array.prototype.every() functions, as in my solutions. An added benefit of this approach is that Object.keys() enumerates only an object\'s own enumerable properties, whereas  "a for-in loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well".Close to the OP\'s solution:Solution that reduces iterating over the Headings/Items:I know this was asked 8 years ago but in ES6 we got the for...of loop which enables the use of standard break functionality:the best way is -\n1) Sort the both array which are used in first and second loop. \n2) if item matched then break the inner loop and hold the index value.\n3) when start next iteration start inner loop with hold index value.
