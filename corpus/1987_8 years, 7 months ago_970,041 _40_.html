My DOM looks like this:When someone clicks on an image, I want the image src to change to <img src="imgx_off.gif"> where x represents the image number 1 or 2.Is this possible or do I have to use CSS to change the images?You can use jQuery\'s attr() function.  For example, if you img tag has an id attribute of \'my_image\':Then you can change the src in jQuery by:To attach this to a click event, you could write:To rotate the image, you could do this:One of the common mistakes people do when change the image source is not waiting for image load to do afterward actions like maturing image size etc.\nYou will need to use jQuery .load() method to do stuff after image load.Reason for editing: https://stackoverflow.com/a/670433/561545I\'ll show you how to change the image src, so that when you click an image it rotates through all the images that are in your HTML (in your d1 id and c1 class specifically)... whether you have 2 or more images in your HTML.I\'ll also show you how to clean up the page after the document is ready, so that only one image is displayed initially.The full codeThe breakdownCreate a copy of the links containing the images (note: you could also make use of the href attribute of the links for added functionality... for example display the working link below each image):Check how many images were in the HTML and create a variable to track which image is being shown:Modify the document\'s HTML so that only the first image is being shown. Delete all the other images.Bind a function to handle when the image link is clicked.The heart of the above code is using ++$imgShow % $length to cycle through the jQuery object containing the images. ++$imgShow % $length first increases our counter by one, then it mods that number with how many images there are. This will keep the resultant index cycling from 0 to length-1, which are the indices of the $images object. This means this code will work with 2, 3, 5, 10, or 100 images... cycling through each image in order and restarting at the first image when the last image is reached.Additionally, .attr() is used to get and set the "src" attribute of the images. To pick elements from among the $images object, I set $images as the jQuery context using the form $(selector, context). Then I use .eq() to pick just the element with the specific index I\'m interested in.\nYou can also store the srcs in an array.\njsFiddle example with 3 imagesAnd here\'s how to incorporate the hrefs from the anchor tags around the images:\njsFiddle exampleFor more information. I try setting src attribute with attr method in jquery for ad image using the syntax for example: $("#myid").attr(\'src\', \'/images/sample.gif\');This solution is useful and it works but if changing the path change also the path for image and not working.I\'ve searching for resolve this issue but not found nothing. The solution is putting the \'\\\' at the beginning the path: \n$("#myid").attr(\'src\', \'\\images/sample.gif\');This trick is very useful for me and I hope it is useful for other.IF there is not only jQuery or other resource killing frameworks - many kb to download each time by each user just for a simple trick - but also native JavaScript(!):This can be written general and more elegant:You can also do this with jQuery in this way:You can have a condition if there are multiple states for the image source.If you want something using jQuery you might want to look into the jQuery Cycle Plugin, demo scrollRight (bottom-right example)I have the same wonder today, I did on this way :I had the same problem when trying to call re captcha button.\nAfter some searching, now  the below function works fine in almost all the famous browsers(chrome,Firefox,IE,Edge,...):\'theUrl\' is used to render new captcha image and can be ignored in your case. The most important point is generating new URL which forces FF and IE to rerender the image.There is no way of changing the image source with CSS.Only possible way is using Javascript or any Javascript library like jQuery.The images are inside a div and there are no class or id with that image.So logic will be select the elements inside the div where the images are located.Then select all the images elements with loop and change the image src with Javascript / jQuery.
