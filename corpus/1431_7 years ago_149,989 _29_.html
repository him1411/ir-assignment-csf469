What is the difference betweenandThey both seem to output \xe2\x80\x9cab\xe2\x80\x9d.The difference is in the second argument. The second argument to substring is the index to stop at (but not include), but the second argument to substr is the maximum length to return.Links?https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substrhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substringsubstr (MDN) takes parameters as (from, length).\nsubstring (MDN) takes parameters as (from, to).You can remember substring takes indices, as does yet another string extraction method, slice.When starting from 0 you can use either method.Another gotcha I recently came across is that in IE 8, "abcd".substr(-1) erroneously returns "abcd", whereas Firefox 3.6 returns "d" as it should. slice works correctly on both.More on this topic can be found here.As hinted at in yatima2975\'s answer, there is an additional difference:substr() accepts a negative starting position as an offset from the end of the string.  substring() does not.From MDN:If start is negative, substr() uses it as a character index from the\n  end of the string.So to sum up the functional differences:substring(begin-offset, end-offset-exclusive) where begin-offset is 0 or greatersubstr(begin-offset, length) where begin-offset may also be negativeThe difference is second parameter. Their second parameters, while both numbers, are expecting two different things:When using substring the second parameter is the first index not to include:When using substr the second parameter is the number of characters to include in the substring:Slice vs Substr vs Substring vs [ ] MethodsThere are performance benefits to each of these javascript methods. Please use these functions accordingly.The main difference is thatsubstr() allows you to specify the maximum length to return substring() allows you to specify the indices and the second argument is NOT inclusiveThere are some additional subtleties between substr() and substring() such as the handling of equal arguments and negative arguments. Also note substring() and slice() are similar but not always the same.The big difference is, substr() is a deprecated method that can still be used, but should be used with caution because they are expected to be removed entirely sometime in the future. You should work to remove their use from your code. And the substring() method succeeded and specified the former one.
