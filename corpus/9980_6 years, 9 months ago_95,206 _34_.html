I\'m on a mac, doing:rails serverI get:I know I can start one on a new port, but I want to kill this process.Assuming you\'re looking to kill whatever is on port 3000 (which is what webrick normally uses), type this in your terminal to find out the PID of the process:Then, use the number in the PID column to kill the process:kill -9 $(lsof -i tcp:3000 -t)You need to get process id of program using tcp port 3000. To get process idAnd then using that process id, simply kill process using ubuntu kill command.Or just run below mentioned combine command. It will first fetch pid and then kill that process.For anyone stumbling across this question that is not on a Mac: assuming you know that your server is running on port 3000, you can do this in one shot by executing the following:But as Toby has mentioned, the implementation of fuser in Mac OS is rather primitive and this command will not work on mac.Some times there is a chance where rails server not closed properly.\nYou can find process used by railsps aux | grep railsOutput will be like Here process_id 12609 is used by your rails server.You can kill it easily by commandkill -9 12609All the answers above are really good but I needed a way to type as little as possible in the terminal so I created a gem for that. You can install the gem only once and run the command \'shutup\' every time you wanna kill the Rails process (while being in the current folder). gem install shutupthen go in the current folder of your rails project and run shutup # this will kill the Rails process currently runningYou can use the command \'shutup\' every time you wantDICLAIMER: I am the creator of this gemNOTE: if you are using rvm install the gem globally Type in:Then look for -w, -n, and -i -i: internet stuff\n-n: makes it faster\n-w: toggles warningsThere are WAY more details on the man pagesIf you are on windows machine follow these steps.There you will a file called server.piddelete it.Thats it.EDIT: Please refer this
