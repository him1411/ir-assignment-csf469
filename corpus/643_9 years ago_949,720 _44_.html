Given a string of JSON data, how can you safely turn that string into a JavaScript object?Obviously you can do this unsafely with something like......but that leaves us vulnerable to the json string containing other code, which it seems very dangerous to simply eval.Is a pure JavaScript approach so long as you can require a reasonably modern browser.See also https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parseThe jQuery method is now deprecated. Use this method instead:Original answer using deprecated jQuery functionality:If you\'re using jQuery just use:It\'s exactly what you\'re looking for (see the jQuery documentation).Edit: This answer is outdated and Jonathan\'s answer above (JSON.parse(jsonString)) is now the best answer.JSON.org has JSON parsers for many languages including 4 different ones for Javascript.  I believe most people would consider json2.js their goto implementation.Use simple code represented in the following link on MSDN.and reverseI\'m not sure about other ways to do it but here\'s how you do it in Prototype (JSON tutorial).Calling evalJSON() with true as the argument sanitizes the incoming string.This seems to be the issue:An input is received, via ajax websocket etc, and it is always gonna be in String format - but you need to know if it is JSON.parsable. Touble is, that if you always run it through a JSON.parse, the program MAY continue \'successfully\' but you\'ll still see an error thrown in the console with the dreaded "Error: unexpected token \'x\'".If you\'re using jQuery, you can also just do $.getJSON(url, function(data) { });Then you can do things like data.key1.something, data.key1.something_else, etc.The callback is passed the returned data, which will be a JavaScript object or array as defined by the JSON structure and parsed using the $.parseJSON() method.Just for fun, here is the way using function :       If you want this method can be used on this way.Here Data object which you want ex:Data=\'{result:true,count:1}\'This method really helps in Nodejs If you are working with serial port programing The easiest way using parse() method:then you can get the values of the Json elements, for example:Using jQuery as described in the documentation:I have successfully been using json_sans_eval for a while now. According to its author, it is more secure than json2.js.Using JSON.parse is probably the best way. Here\'s an example live demoI found a "better" way:In CoffeeScript:In Javascript:JSON.parse() converts any JSON String passed into the function, to a JSON Object.For Better understanding press F12 to open Inspect Element of your browser and go to console to write following commands  : -Now run the command :-you\'ll get output as Object {result: true, count: 1}.In order to use that Object, you can assign it to the variable let\'s say obj :-Now by using obj and dot(.) operator you can access properties of the JSON Object.Try to run the command json.parse will change into object.JSON parsing is always pain in ass. If the input is not as expected it throws an error and crashes what you are doing. You can use the following tiny function to safely parse your input. It always turns an object even if the input is not valid or is already an object which is better for most cases.JS Guru Douglas Crockford has written a parseJSON function which you download hereConverting the object to JSON, and then parsing it, works for me, like:You also can use reviver function to filter.for more information read JSON.parse
