I have this sql:but apparently, on some other databases we use, the constraint has a different name. How do I check if there\'s a constraint with the name FK_ChannelPlayerSkins_Channels.try this:-- EDIT --When I originally answered this question, I was thinking "Foreign Key" because the original question asked about finding "FK_ChannelPlayerSkins_Channels".  Since then many people have commented on finding other "constraints" here are some other queries for that:here is an alternate method If you need even more constraint information, look inside the system stored procedure master.sys.sp_helpconstraint to see how to get certain information.  To view the source code using SQL Server Management Studio get into the "Object Explorer".  From there you expand the "Master" database, then expand "Programmability", then "Stored Procedures", then "System Stored Procedures".  You can then find "sys.sp_helpconstraint" and right click it and select "modify".  Just be careful to not save any changes to it.  Also, you can just use this system stored procedure on any table by using it like EXEC sp_helpconstraint YourTableNameHere.Easiest way to check for the existence of a constraint (and then do something such as drop it if it exists) is to use the OBJECT_ID() function...OBJECT_ID can be used without the second parameter (\'C\' for check constraints only) and that may also work, but if your constraint name matches the name of other objects in the database you may get unexpected results.  OBJECT_ID can also be used with other "constraints" such as Foreign Key constraints or Primary Key constraints, etc.  For best results, always include the appropriate object type as the second parameter for the OBJECT_ID function:Constraint Object Types:Also note that the schema is often required.  The schema of constraints generally takes the schema of the parent table.  Failure to put your constraints (or whatever you are checking) in brackets when using this method may also cause a false negative -- if your object uses unusual characters (such as a .), the brackets are required.  If you are looking for other type of constraint, e.g. defaults, you should use different query\n(From How do I find a default constraint using INFORMATION_SCHEMA? answered by devio). Use:to find a default constraint by name.I\'ve put together different \'IF not Exists" checks in my post "DDL \'IF not Exists" conditions to make SQL scripts re-runnable"Are you looking at something like this, below is tested in SQL Server 2005Just something to watch out for......In SQL Server 2008 R2 SSMS, the "Script Constraint as -> DROP And CREATE To" command produces T-SQL like belowOut of the box, this script does NOT drop the constraint because the SELECT returns 0 rows.  (see post Microsoft Connect). The name of the default constraint is wrong but I gather it also has something to do with the OBJECT_ID function because changing the name doesn\'t fix the problem.To fix this, I removed the usage of OBJECT_ID and used the default constraint name instead.I use the following query to check for an existing constraint before I create it.This queries for the constraint by name targeting a given table name. Hope this helps.INFORMATION_SCHEMA is your friend. It has all kinds of views that show all kinds of schema information. Check your system views. You will find you have three views dealing with constraints, one being CHECK_CONSTRAINTS.I use this to check for and remote constraints on a column. It should have everything you need.You can use the one above with one caveat:\nIF EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM sys.foreign_keys WHERE parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N\'dbo.TableName\') and name = \'CONSTRAINTNAME\')\n BEGIN \nALTER TABLE TableName DROP CONSTRAINT CONSTRAINTNAME \nEND Need to use the name=[Constraint name] since a table may have multiple foreign keys and still not have the foreign key being checked for
