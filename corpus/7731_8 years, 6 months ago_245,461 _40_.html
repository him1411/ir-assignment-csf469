I need to search a WPF control hierarchy for controls that match a given name or type. How can I do this?I combined the template format used by John Myczek and Tri Q\'s algorithm above to create a findChild Algorithm that can be used on any parent. Keep in mind that recursively searching a tree downwards could be a lengthy process. I\'ve only spot-checked this on a WPF application, please comment on any errors you might find and I\'ll correct my code.  WPF Snoop is a useful tool in looking at the visual tree - I\'d strongly recommend using it while testing or using this algorithm to check your work. There is a small error in Tri Q\'s Algorithm. After the child is found, if childrenCount is > 1 and we iterate again we can overwrite the properly found child. Therefore I added a if (foundChild != null) break; into my code to deal with this condition. Call it like this: Note Application.Current.MainWindow can be any parent window. You can also find an element by name using FrameworkElement.FindName(string).Given:In the code-behind file, you could write:Of course, because it\'s defined using x:Name, you could just reference the generated field, but perhaps you want to look it up dynamically rather than statically.This approach is also available for templates, in which the named item appears multiple times (once per usage of the template).You can use the VisualTreeHelper to find controls. Below is a method that uses the VisualTreeHelper to find a parent control of a specified type.  You can use the VisualTreeHelper to find controls in other ways as well.Call it like this:I may be just repeating everyone else but I do have a pretty piece of code that extends the DependencyObject class with a method FindChild() that will get you the child by type and name. Just include and use.Hope you find it useful.My extensions to the code.Source:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/gishu-util/source/browse/#git%2FWPF%2FUtilitiesExplanatory blog post :\nhttp://madcoderspeak.blogspot.com/2010/04/wpf-find-child-control-of-specific-type.htmlI edited CrimsonX\'s code as it was not working with superclass types:If you want to find ALL controls of a specific type, you might be interested in this snippet tooThis will dismiss some elements - you should extend it like this in order to support a wider array of controls. For a brief discussion, have a look hereWhilst I love recursion in general, it\'s not as efficient as iteration when programming in C#, so perhaps the following solution is neater than the one suggested by John Myczek above?Here\'s my code to find controls by Type while controlling how deep we go into the hierarchy \n(maxDepth == 0 means infinitely deep).exciton80... I was having a problem with your code not recursing through usercontrols.  It was hitting the Grid root and throwing an error.  I believe this fixes it for me:I have a sequence function like this (which is completely general):Getting immediate children:Finding all children down the hiararchical tree:You can call this on the Window to get all controls.After you have the collection, you can use LINQ (i.e. OfType, Where).Since the question is general enough that it might attract people looking for answers to very trivial cases: if you just want a child rather than a descendant, you can use Linq:or of course the obvious for loop iterating over Children.Here is a solution that uses a flexible predicate:You can for example call it like this:These options already talk about traversing the Visual Tree in C#. \nIts possible to traverse the visual tree in xaml as well using RelativeSource markup extension. msdnfind by typeTo find an ancestor of a given type from code, you can use:This implementation uses iteration instead of recursion which can be slightly faster.If you\'re using C# 7, this can be made slightly shorter:Try this Code Behind
