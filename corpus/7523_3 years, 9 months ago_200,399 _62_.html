To set the minimal distance between flexbox items I\'m using margin: 0 5px on .item and margin: 0 -5px on container. For me it seems like a hack, but I can\'t find any better way to do this.Example Therefore achieving what you are asking for is a bit more difficult.In my experience, the "cleanest" way that doesn\'t use :first-child/:last-child\nand works without any modification on flex-wrap:wrap is to set padding:5px on the container and margin:5px on the children. That will produce a 10px gap between each children and between each children and their parent.DemoThis is not a hack.\nThe same technique is also used by bootstrap and its grid, though, instead of margin, bootstrap uses padding for its cols.You can use transparent borders.I have contemplated this issue while trying to build a flex grid model which can fallback to a tables + table-cell model for older browsers. And Borders for column gutters seemed to me the best appropriate choice. i.e. Table-cells don\'t have margins.e.g.Also note that you need min-width: 50px; for flexbox. The flex model will not handle fixed sizes unless you do flex: none; on the particular child element you want as fixed and therefore excluded from being "flexi". http://jsfiddle.net/GLpUp/4/\nBut all columns together with flex:none; is no longer a flex model.\nHere is something closer to a flex model: http://jsfiddle.net/GLpUp/5/So you can actually use margins normally if you don\'t need the table-cell fallback for older browsers. http://jsfiddle.net/GLpUp/3/Setting background-clip: padding-box; will be necessary when using a background, as otherwise the background will flow into the transparent border area.Hello, below is my working solution for all browsers supporting flexbox. No negative margins, no hacks, no workarounds, pure Css.Fiddle DemoI have found a solution that is based on the css preceded by selector ~, and allows inifinite nesting.See this code pen for a working exampleBasically, inside of column containers, every child that is preceded by another child gets a top margin. Likewise, inside every row container, every child that is preceded by another gets a left margin.Moving on from sawa\'s answer, here\'s a slightly improved version that allows you to set a fixed spacing between the items without the surrounding margin.http://jsfiddle.net/chris00/s52wmgtq/49/Also included is the Safari "-webkit-flex" version.I have used this for wrapped and fixed width columns. The key here is calc()SCSS sampleFull Codepen sampleA flex container with -x (negative) margin and flex items with x (positive) margin or padding both lead to the desired visual result: Flex items have a fixed gap of 2x only between each other.It appears to be simply a matter of preference, whether to use margin or padding on the flex items. In this example, the flex items are scaled dynamically in order to preserve the fixed gap:Let\'s say if you want to set 10px space between the items, you can just set .item {margin-right:10px;} for all, and reset it on the last one .item:last-child {margin-right:0;}.Flexbox is so clever that it recalculates automatically and equally distributes the grid.jsFiddleIn addition, you can also use general ~ or next + sibling selector to set left margin on the items excluding the first one .item ~ .item {margin-left:10px;}, or use .item:not(:last-child) {margin-right: 10px;}jsFiddleWhy not do it like this:This uses the adjacent sibling selector, to give all .item elements, except the first one a margin-left. Thanks to flexbox, this even results in equally wide elements. This could also be done with vertically positioned elements and margin-top, of course.I find the easiest way of doing this is with percentages and just allowing the margin to tally up your widthThis means you end up with something like this if you where using your exampleDoes mean your values are based on the width though which might not be good for everybody.Using Flexbox in my solution I\'ve used the justify-content property for the parent element (container) and I\'ve specified the margins inside the flex-basis property of the items.\nCheck the code snippet below:I posted my flexbox approach \nhere:One idea I rejected was to remove the padding from the outer columns with something like this:But, like other posters here, I prefer the negative margin trick. My fiddle also has responsiveness for anyone is looking for a Sass-based solution. I basically use this approach in place of a grid.https://jsfiddle.net/x3jvfrg1/I came across the same issue earlier, then stumbled upon the answer for this. Hope it will help others for future reference.long answer short, add a border to your child flex-items.\nthen you can specify margins between flex-items to whatever you like.\nIn the snippet, i use black for illustration purposes, you can use \'transparent\' if you like.Here\'s my solution, that doesn\'t require setting any classes on the child elements:Usage:The same technique can be used for normal flex rows and columns in addition to the inline example given above, and extended with classes for spacing other than 4px.Here\'s a grid of card UI elements with spacing completed using flexible box:I was frustrated with manually spacing the cards by manipulating padding and margins with iffy results. So here\'s the combinations of CSS attributes I\'ve found very effective:Hope this helps folks, present and future.It won\'t work in every case but if you have flexible child widths (%) and know the number of items per row you can very cleanly specify the margins of the necessary elements by using nth-child selector/s.It depends largely on what you mean by "better". This way doesn\'t require additional wrapper markup for child elements or negative elements - but those things both have their place.
