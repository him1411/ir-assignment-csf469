I have a nested list of data. Its length is 132 and each item is a list of length 20. Is there a quick way to convert this structure into a data frame that has 132 rows and 20 columns of data?I am new to R, so I figure there is probably an easy way to do this. I searched here on Stack Overflow and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a similar question, so I apologize if I missed it.  Some sample data:Assuming your list of lists is called l:The above will convert all character columns to factors, to avoid this you can add a parameter to the data.frame() call:With rbindEdit: Previous version return data.frame of list\'s instead of vectors (as @IanSudbery pointed out in comments).You can use the plyr package.\nFor example a nested list of the formhas now a length of 4 and each list in l contains another list of the length 3.\nNow you can runand should get the same result as in the answer @Marek and @nico.data.frame(t(sapply(mylistlist,c)))sapply converts it to a matrix.\ndata.frame converts the matrix to a data frame.assume your list is called L,The package data.table has the function rbindlist which is a superfast implementation of do.call(rbind, list(...)).It can take a list of  lists, data.frames or data.tables  as input.This returns a data.table inherits from data.frame.If you really want to convert back to a data.frame use as.data.frame(DT)Reshape2 yields the same output as the plyr example above:yields:If you were almost out of pixels you could do this all in 1 line w/ recast().More answers, along with timings in the answer to this question:\nWhat is the most efficient way to cast a list as a data frame?The quickest way, that doesn\'t produce a dataframe with lists rather than vectors for columns appears to be (from Martin Morgan\'s answer):Extending on @Marek\'s answer: if you want to avoid strings to be turned into factors and efficiency is not a concern tryFor the general case of deeply nested lists with 3 or more levels like the ones obtained from a nested JSON:consider the approach of melt() to convert the nested list to a tall format first: followed by dcast() then to wide again into a tidy dataset where each variable forms a a column and each observation forms a row: The tibble package has a function enframe() that solves this problem by coercing nested list objects to nested tibble ("tidy" data frame) objects. Here\'s a brief example from R for Data Science:Since you have several nests in your list, l, you can use the unlist(recursive = FALSE) to remove unnecessary nesting to get just a single hierarchical list and then pass to enframe(). I use tidyr::unnest() to unnest the output into a single level "tidy" data frame, which has your two columns (one for the group name and one for the observations with the groups value). If you want columns that make wide, you can add a column using add_column() that just repeats the order of the values 132 times. Then just spread() the values.\nThis is what finally worked for me:do.call("rbind", lapply(S1, as.data.frame))Sometimes your data may be a list of lists of vectors of the same length.(The inner vectors could also be lists, but I\'m simplifying to make this easier to read).Then you can make the following modification. Remember that you can unlist one level at a time:Now use your favorite method mentioned in the other answers:
