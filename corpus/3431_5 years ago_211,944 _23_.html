I thought this would be a very common thing, but I couldn\'t find how to handle it in AngularJS. Let\'s say I have a list of events and want to output them with AngularJS, then that\'s pretty easy:But how do I handle the case when the list is empty? I want to have a message box in place where the list is with something like "No events" or similar. The only thing that would come close is the ng-switch with events.length (how do I check if empty when an object and not an array?), but is that really the only option I have?You can use ngShow.See example.Or you can use ngHideSee example.For object you can test Object.keys.And if you want to use this with a filtered list here\'s a neat trick:You might want to check out the angular-ui directive ui-if if you just want to remove the ul from the DOM when the list is empty:With the newer versions of angularjs the correct answer to this question is to use ng-if:This solution will not flicker when the list is about to download either because the list has to be defined and with a length of 0 for the message to display.Here is a plunker to show it in use: http://plnkr.co/edit/in7ha1wTlpuVgamiOblS?p=previewTip: You can also show a loading text or spinner: This is similar to @Konrad \'ktoso\' Malawski but slightly easier to remember.Tested with Angular 1.4Here\'s a different approach using CSS instead of JavaScript/AngularJS.CSS:Markup:If the list is empty, <li ng-repeat="item in filteredItems">, etc. will get commented out and will become a comment instead of a li element.You can use this ng-switch:i usually use ng-show where variable you define for example you can use ng-if because this is not render in html page and you dont see your html tag in inspect...
