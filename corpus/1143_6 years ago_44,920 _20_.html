I noticed that in Internet Explorer (but, unfortunately, not in the other browsers I tested), you can use some Unicode variable names. This made my day, and I was absolutely delighted that I could write fun Unicode-laden code like this:For some reason, though, \xe2\x97\x8e\xdc\xab\xe2\x97\x8e, \xe2\x99\xa8_\xe2\x99\xa8 and \xe2\x98\xba are not valid variable names.Why do \xe0\xb2\xa0_\xe0\xb2\xa0 and \xe9\x96\x8b\xe5\xbf\x83\xe9\xa6\xac work, but \xe2\x97\x8e\xdc\xab\xe2\x97\x8e, \xe2\x99\xa8_\xe2\x99\xa8 and \xe2\x98\xba don\'t?EDIT: Test it out in your browser on JSFiddle. I\'ve tested it in Internet Explorer 9, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. So far, it seems to only work in Internet Explorer 9. (I don\'t know about Internet Explorer 8 and below.) Let me know if it works in another browser.\xe0\xb2\xa0_\xe0\xb2\xa0\nand \xe8\x8d\x89\xe6\xb3\xa5\xe9\xa9\xac only contain "letters" used in actual alphabets; that is, \xe0\xb2\xa0\nis a symbol from the Kannada alphabet, and \xe8\x8d\x89\xe6\xb3\xa5\xe9\xa9\xac consists of Chinese characters.\xe2\x97\x8e and \xe2\x98\xba, however, are purely symbols; they are not associated with any alphabet.The ECMAScript standard, chapter 7.6 (which all the browsers except Internet Explorer are following), states that an identifier must start with one of the following.The following characters of an identifier must be one of the following.IE goes beyond the standard and is permissive enough to allow some symbols, such as \xe2\x98\xba.There\xe2\x80\x99s a tool that will tell you if any string that you enter is a valid JavaScript variable name according to ECMAScript 5.1 and Unicode 6.1.EcmaScript 262, section 7.6 says names must start with $, _, or a Unicode letter, and after that may contain either those characters, or Unicode combining marks, Unicode digits, or Unicode connector punctuation (and a couple of format-control characters that are language specific.)So, the difference between allowed and not allowed identifiers in your cases is probably whether the leading character is considered a "letter".To quote Valid JavaScript variable names, my write-up summarizing the relevant spec sections:An identifier must start with $, _, or any character in the Unicode categories \xe2\x80\x9cUppercase letter (Lu)\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cLowercase letter (Ll)\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cTitlecase letter (Lt)\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cModifier letter (Lm)\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cOther letter (Lo)\xe2\x80\x9d, or \xe2\x80\x9cLetter number (Nl)\xe2\x80\x9d.The rest of the string can contain the same characters, plus any U+200C zero width non-joiner characters, U+200D zero width joiner characters, and characters in the Unicode categories \xe2\x80\x9cNon-spacing mark (Mn)\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cSpacing combining mark (Mc)\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cDecimal digit number (Nd)\xe2\x80\x9d, or \xe2\x80\x9cConnector punctuation (Pc)\xe2\x80\x9d.I\xe2\x80\x99ve also created a tool that will tell you if any string that you enter is a valid JavaScript variable name according to ECMAScript 5.1 and Unicode 6.3:P.S. If you were to summarize all these rules in a single ASCII-only regular expression for JavaScript, it would be over 9,000 characters long. Here it is:For the great justice: since most things in JS are "objects", you can use square-bracket syntax:This is the same thing as do var smth = true in global context.
