I\'ve installed RubyInstaller on Windows and I\'m running IMAP Sync but I need to use it to sync hundreds of accounts. If I could pass these variables to it via command line I could automate the whole process better.Something like this:thenorDon\'t reinvent the wheel; check out Ruby\'s way-cool OptionParser library.It offers parsing of flags/switches, parameters with optional or required values, can parse lists of parameters into a single option and can generate your help for you.Also, if any of your information being passed in is pretty static, that doesn\'t change between runs, put it into a YAML file that gets parsed. That way you can have things that change every time on the command-line, and things that change occasionally configured outside your code. That separation of data and code is nice for maintenance.Here are some samples to play with:This is a sample YAML file if your destinations are pretty static:This will let you easily generate a YAML file:Unfortunately, Ruby does not support such passing mechanism as e.g. AWK:It means you cannot pass named values into your script directly.Using cmd options may help:Ruby stores all cmd arguments in the ARGV array, the scriptname itself can be captured using the $PROGRAM_NAME variable.The obvious disadvantage is that you depend on the order of values.If you need only Boolean switches use the option -s of the Ruby interpreter:Please note the -- switch, otherwise Ruby will complain about a nonexistent option -agreed, so pass it as a switch to your cmd invokation. You don\'t need it in the following case:The disadvantage is that you mess with global variables and have only logical true/false values.You can access values from environment variables:Drawbacks are present here to, you have to set all the variables before the script invocation (only for your ruby process) or to export them (shells like BASH):In the latter case, your data will be readable for everybody in the same shell session and for all subprocesses, which can be a serious security implication.And at least you can implement an option parser using getoptlong and optparse.Happy hacking!You can also try out cliqr. Its pretty new and in active development. But there are stable releases ready to be used. Here is the git repo: https://github.com/anshulverma/cliqrLook into the example folder to get an idea on how it can be used.Run this code on the command line and enter the value of N:
