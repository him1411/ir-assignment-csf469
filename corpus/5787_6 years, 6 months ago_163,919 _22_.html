I have a working copy of the project, without any source control meta data. Now, I\'d like to do the equivalent of git-clone into this folder, and keep my local changes.git-clone doesn\'t allow me to clone into an existing folder. What is the best practice here?This can be done by cloning to a new directory, then moving the .git directory into your existing directory.If your existing directory is named "code".This can also be done without doing a checkout during the clone command; more information can be found here.Don\'t clone, fetch instead. In the repo:Then you can reset the tree to get the commit you want:and you are like you cloned.The interesting question here (and the one without answer): How to find out which commit your naked tree was based on, hence to which position to reset to.I\'d git clone to a new directory and copy the content of the existing directory to the new clone. Using a temp directory is fine, but this will work if you want to avoid that step. From the root of your working directory:The following i did, to checkout master branch in an existing directory:To clone a git repo into an empty existing directory do the following:Notice the . at the end of your git clone command. That will download the repo into the current working directory.There are two approaches to this. Where possible I would start with a clean folder for your new git working directory and then copy your version of things in later. This might look something like*:At this point you should have a pretty clean working copy with your previous working folder as the current working directory so any changes include file deletions will show up on the radar if you run git status.On the other hand if you really must do it the other way around, you can get the same result with something like this:Either way, the first thing I would do is run something like git stash to get a copy of all your local changes set aside, then you can re-apply them and work through which ones you want to get committed.* Both examples assume you start out on the shell in the parent directory of your project.If you are using at least git 1.7.7 (which taught clone the --config option), to turn the current directory into a working copy:This works by:This obviously won\'t work if a .git metadata directory already exists in the directory you wish to turn into a working copy.
