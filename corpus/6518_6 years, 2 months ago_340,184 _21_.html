We are switching hosts and the old one provided a sql dump of the postgresql database of our site.\nNow I\'m trying to set this up on a local wamp sever to test this.The only problem is that i don\'t have an idea how i can import this database in the postgresql 9 i have set up.I tried pgAdmin III but i can\'t seem to find an \'import\' function. So i just opened the SQL editor and pasted the contents of the dump there and executed it, it creates the tables but i keeps giving me errors when he tries to put the data in it.I\'ve also tried to this with the command prompt but i can\'t really find the command that i need.If I do i get the error What\'s the best way to import the database?That\'s the command you are looking for.

Drop the schema(s) that your dump contains. Then right-click on the database and choose Restore. Then you can browse for the dump file.I use:Hope this will help someone.
