I am trying to fix a div so it always sticks to the top of the screen, using:However, the div is inside a centered container. When I use position:fixed it fixes the div relative to the browser window, such as it\'s up against the right side of the browser. Instead, it should be fixed relative to the container.I know that position:absolute can be used to fix an element relative to the div, but when you scroll down the page the element vanishes and doesn\'t stick to the top as with position:fixed.Is there a hack or workaround to achieve this?Short answer: no. (It is now possible with CSS transform.  See the edit below)Long answer: The problem with using "fixed" positioning is that it takes the element out of flow. thus it can\'t be re-positioned relative to its parent because it\'s as if it didn\'t have one.  If, however, the container is of a fixed, known width, you can use something like:http://jsfiddle.net/HFjU6/1/This is outdated information.  It is now possible to center content of an dynamic size (horizontally and vertically) with the help of the magic of CSS3 transform.  The same principle applies, but instead of using margin to offset your container, you can use translateX(-50%).  This doesn\'t work with the above margin trick because you don\'t know how much to offset it unless the width is fixed and you can\'t use relative values (like 50%) because it will be relative to the parent and not the element it\'s applied to.  transform behaves differently.  Its values are relative to the element they are applied to.  Thus, 50% for transform means half the width of the element, while 50% for margin is half of the parent\'s width. This is an IE9+ solutionUsing similar code to the above example, I recreated the same scenario using completely dynamic width and height:If you want it to be centered, you can do that too:jsFiddle: Centered horizontally only\njsFiddle: Centered both horizontally and vertically\nOriginal credit goes to user aaronk6 for pointing it out to me in this answerActually this is possible and the accepted answer only deals with centralising, which is straightforward enough. Also you really don\'t need to use JavaScript.Set everything up as you would if you want to position: absolute inside a position: relative container, and then create a new fixed position div inside the div with position: absolute, but do not set its top and left properties. It will then be fixed wherever you want it, relative to the container.For example:Sadly, I was hoping this thread might solve my issue with Android\'s WebKit rendering box-shadow blur pixels as margins on fixed position elements, but it seems it\'s a bug. Anyway, I hope this helps!While I agree that Graeme Blackwood\'s should be the accepted answer, because it practically solves the issue, it should be noted that a fixed element can be positioned relatively to its container.I noticed by accident that when applyingto the body, it made a fixed child relative to it (instead of the viewport). So my fixed elements left and top properties were now relative to the container.So I did some research, and found that the issue was already been covered by Eric Meyer and even if it felt like a "trick", turns out that this is part of the specifications:For elements whose layout is governed by the CSS box model, any value\n  other than none for the transform results in the creation of both a\n  stacking context and a containing block. The object acts as a\n  containing block for fixed positioned descendants.http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/So, if you apply any transformation to a parent element, it will become the containing block.The problem is that the implementation seems buggy/creative, because the elements also stop behaving as fixed (even if this bit doesn\'t seem to be part of specification).The same behavior will be found in Safari, Chrome and Firefox, but not in IE11 (where the fixed element will still remain fixed).Another interesting (undocumented) thing is that when a fixed element is contained inside a transformed element, while its top and left properties will now be related to the container, respecting the box-sizing property, its scrolling context will extend over the border of the element, as if box-sizing was set to border-box. For some creative out there, this could possibly become a plaything :)TESTThe answer is yes, as long as you don\'t set left: 0 or right: 0 after you set the div position to fixed.http://jsfiddle.net/T2PL5/85/Checkout the sidebar div. It is fixed, but related to the parent, not to the window view point.I have created this jQuery plugin to solve a similar issue I was having where I had a centered container (tabular data), and I wanted the header to fix to the top of the page when the list was scrolled, yet I wanted it anchored to the tabular data so it would be wherever I put the container (centered, left, right) and also allow it to move left and right with the page when scrolled horizontally.Here is the link to this jQuery plugin that may solve this problem:https://github.com/bigspotteddog/ScrollToFixedThe description of this plugin is as follows:This plugin is used to fix elements to the top of the page, if the element would have scrolled out of view, vertically; however, it does allow the element to continue to move left or right with the horizontal scroll.Given an option marginTop, the element will stop moving vertically upward once the vertical scroll has reached the target position; but, the element will still move horizontally as the page is scrolled left or right. Once the page has been scrolled back down passed the target position, the element will be restored to its original position on the page.This plugin has been tested in Firefox 3/4, Google Chrome 10/11, Safari 5, and Internet Explorer 8/9.Usage for your particular case:Just take the top and left styles out of the fixed position div. Here\'s an exampleThe #content div will be sit wherever the parent div sits, but will be fixed there. I had to do this with an advertisement that my client wanted to sit outside of the content area. I simply did the following and it worked like a charm!You have position: sticky that is a new way to position elements and is conceptually similar to position: fixed. The difference is that an element with position: sticky behaves like position: relative within its parent, until a given offset threshold is met in the viewport.  In Chrome 56 (currently beta as of December 2016, stable in Jan 2017) position: sticky is now back.https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/position-stickyMore details are in Stick your landings! position: sticky lands in WebKit.See this jsFiddle example. Resize and see how the fixed elements even move with the floated elements they are in. Use the inner-most scroll bar to see how the scroll would work on a site (fixed elements staying fixed).As many here have stated, one key is not setting any positional settings on the fixed element (no top, right, bottom, or left values).Rather, we put all the fixed elements (note how the last box has four of them) first in the box they are to be positioned off of, like so:Then we use margin-top and margin-left to "move" them in relation to their container, something like as this CSS does:Note that because fixed elements ignore all other layout elements, the final container in our fiddle can have multiple fixed elements, and still have all those elements related to the top left corner. But this is only true if they are all placed first in the container, as this comparison fiddle shows that if dispersed within the container content, positioning becomes unreliable.Whether the wrapper is static, relative, or absolute in positioning, it does not matter.You can give a try to my jQuery plugin, FixTo.Usage:Another weird solution to achieve a relative fixed position is converting your container into an iframe, that way your fixed element can be fixed to it\'s container\'s viewport and not the entire page.With pure CSS you can\'t manage to do it; at least I haven\'t. However you can do it with jQuery very simply. I\'ll explain my problem, and with a little change you can use it.So for a start, I wanted my element to have a fixed top (from top of the window), and a left component to inherit from the parent element (because the parent element is centered). To set the left component, just put your element into the parent and set position:relative for the parent element.Then you need to know how much from the top your element is when the a scroll bar is on top (y zero scrolled); there are two options again. First is that is static (some number) or you have to read it from the parent element.In my case it\'s 150Â pixels from top static. So when you see 150 it\'s how much is the element from the top when we haven\'t scrolled.This is easy (as per HTML below)The trick is to NOT use top or left on the element (div) with "position: fixed;".\nIf these are not specified, the "fixed content" element will appear RELATIVE to the enclosing element (the div with "position:relative;") INSTEAD OF relative to the browser window!!!Above allowed me to locate a closing "X" button at the top of a lot of text in a div with vertical scrolling.  The "X" sits in place (does not move with scrolled text and yet it does move left or right with the enclosing div container when the user resizes the width of the browser window!  Thus it is "fixed" vertically, but positioned relative to the enclosing element horizontally!Before I got this working the "X" scrolled up and out of sight when I scrolled the text content down. Apologies for not providing my javascript hideDiv() function, but it would needlessly make this post longer.  I opted to keep it as short as possible.I created a jsfiddle to demostrate how this works using transform.HTMLCSSjQueryhttps://jsfiddle.net/bx6ktwnn/1/I did something like that awhile back. I was pretty new to JavaScript, so I\'m sure you can do better, but here is a starting point:You will need to set your width, and then it gets the window width and changes the margin every few seconds. I know it is heavy, but it works.It\'s possible if you use JavaScript. In this case, the jQuery plugin Sticky-Kit:I have the same issue, one of our team members gives me a solution.\nTo allowed the div fix position and relative to other div, our solution is to use a father container wrap the fix div and scroll div. cssCheck this:
