I am looking for a simple git command that provides a nicely formatted list of all files that were part of the commit given by a hash (SHA1), with no extraneous information.I have tried:Although it lists the files, it also includes unwanted diff information for each.Is there another git command that will provide just the list I want, so that I can avoid parsing it from the git show output?Preferred Way (because it\'s a plumbing command; meant to be programmatic):Another Way (less preferred for scripts, because it\'s a porcelain command; meant to be user-facing)If you want to get list of changed files:If you want to get list of all files in a commit, you can useI\'ll just assume that gitk is not desired for this. In that case, try git show --name-only <sha>.I personally use the combination of --stat and --oneline with the show command:If you do not like/want the addition/removal stats, you can replace --oneline with --name-onlyRecently I needed to list all changed files between two commits. So I used this (also *nix specific) commandUpdate: Or as Ethan points out belowUsing --name-status will also include the change (added, modified, deleted etc) next to each file You can also do and you can browse through various commits, commit messages and the changed files.Type q to get your prompt back.I use changed alias a quite often. To set it up:then:Similar commands that may be useful:Simplest form: git show --stat (hash)That\'s easier to remember and it will give you all the information you need. If you really want only the names of the files you could add the --name-only option. git show --stat --name-only (hash)Using standard git diff command (also good for scripting):If you want also the status of the changed files:This works well with merge commits.I use this to get list of modified files between two changesets:I like to useI like this:There\'s also git whatchanged, which is more low level than git logIt outputs the commit summary with a list of files beneath it with their modes and if there added(A), deleted(D) or modified(M);Would give something like:I know this answer doesn\'t really match "with no extraneous information.", but I still think this list is more useful then just the filenames.List the files that changed in a commit:This doesn\'t show log messages, extra newlines, or any other clutter.  This works for any commit, not just the current one.  Not sure why it hasn\'t quite been mentioned yet, so I\'m adding it.Use simple one line command, if you just want the list of files changed in the last commit:Display the log.COMMIT can be blank ("") or the sha-1 or the sha-1 shortened.This will list just the files, very useful for further processing.OK, there are couple of ways to show all files in a particular commit...To reduce the info and show only names of the files which committed, you simply can add --name-only or --name-status flag..., these flags just show you the file names which are different from previous commits as you want...So you can do git diff followed by --name-only, with two commit hashes after <sha0> <sha1>, something like below:I also create the below image to show all steps to go through in these situation:A combination of "git show --stat" (thanks Ryan) and a couple of sed commands should trim the data down for you:That will produce just the list of modified files.There is a simple trick to view as a file listing, just add : after the hash.You can then drill in,If you hit a file you\'ll get the raw version of the file; which sometimes is what you want if you\'re only looking for a nice reference or key pieces of code (diffs can make everything a mess),Only drawback of this method is that it doesn\'t easily show a tree of files.works fine for meI thought I would share a summary of my alias..  also I find using \'zsh\' great with git it chroma keys everything nicely and tells you want branch are in all of the time by changing the command prompt.For those covering from SVN you will find this useful: (this is a combination of ideas from different threads, I only take credit of knowing how to use copy/paste)Found a perfect answer to this:So that I can know
