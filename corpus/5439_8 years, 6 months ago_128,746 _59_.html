How can I find out from within an ec2 machine (user root) what my instance id is?See the EC2 documentation on the subject.Run:If you need programatic access to the instance ID from within a script,An example of a more advanced use (retrieve instance ID as well as availability zone and region, etc.):You may also use curl instead of wget, depending on what is installed on your platform.On Amazon Linux AMIs you can do:As its name suggests, you can use the command to get other useful metadata too.On Ubuntu you can:And then you can:You can get most of the metadata associated with the instance this way:Use /dynamic/instance-identity/document if you also need to query more than just your instance id.wget -q -O - http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/documentThis will get you JSON data such as this - with only a single request.For .NET People : For Python:which boils down to the one-liner:Instead of local_hostname you could also use public_hostname, or:on AWS Linux: ec2-metadata --instance-id | cut -d " " -f 2Output:i-33400429Using in variables:For powershell people:See this post - note that the IP address in the URL given is constant (which confused me at first), but the data returned is specific to your instance.Just Type:A more contemporary solution.From Amazon Linux the ec2-metadata command is already installed.From the terminalWill give you the available optionswill returnYou can try this:For Ruby:A c# .net class I wrote for EC2 metadata from the http api.\nI will build it up with functionality as needed. You can run with it if you like it.The latest Java SDK has EC2MetadataUtils:In Java:In Scala:For C++ (using cURL):FWIW I wrote a FUSE filesystem to provide access to the EC2 metadata service: https://bitbucket.org/dgc/ec2mdfs .\nI run this on all custom AMIs; it allows me to use this idiom: cat /ec2/meta-data/ami-idIn Go you can use the goamz package.Here\'s the GetMetaData source.Simply check the var/lib/cloud/instance symlink, it should point to /var/lib/cloud/instances/{instance-id} where {instance_id} is your instance-id.For PHP:This requires you load GuzzleHttp.  If you are using composer, you can install GuzzleHttp by running:You can just make a HTTP request to GET any Metadata by passing the your metadata parameters.or You won\'t be billed for HTTP requests to get Metadata and Userdata.ElseYou can use EC2 Instance Metadata Query Tool which is a  simple bash script that uses curl to query the EC2 instance Metadata from within a running EC2 instance as mentioned in documentation.Download the tool:now run command to get required data.Refer:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.htmlhttps://aws.amazon.com/items/1825?externalID=1825Happy To Help.. :)In the question you have mentioned the user as root, one thing I should mention is that the instance ID is not dependent on the user. For Node developers,For PowerShell:Use this to execute from the instance itself.
