Is there a simple way of finding out the current value of a specified Vim setting? If I want to know the current value of, say tabstop, I can run:without passing an argument, and Vim will tell me the current value. This is fine for many settings, but it is no good for those that are either true or false. For example, if I want to find out the current value of expandtab, running:will actually enable expandtab. I just want to find out if it is enabled or not.This sort of does what I want:but it seems quite verbose. Is there a quicker way?Add a ? mark after the setting name and it will show the valueAlternatively, the & symbol can be used to mean "option" - e.g.There are also additional vim settings that can be displayed as well, such as::highlightFor the full list, see:\nhttp://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Displaying_the_current_Vim_environment
