I am doing some experimentation with Node.js and would like to read a JSON object, either from a text file or a .js file (which is better??) into memory so that I can access that object quickly from code.  I realize that there are things like Mongo, Alfred, etc out there, but that is not what I need right now.How do I read a JSON object out of a text or js file and into server memory using JavaScript/Node?Sync:Async:The easiest way I have found to do this is to just use require and the path to your JSON file.For example, suppose you have the following JSON file.test.jsonYou can then easily load this in your node.js application using requireAsynchronous is there for a reason! Throws stone at @mihaiOtherwise, here is the code he used with the asynchronous version:https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_file_options_callback https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfilesync_file_options You can find all usage of Node.js at the File System docs!\nhope this help for you!  In Node 8 you can use the built-in util.promisify() to asynchronously read a file like this
