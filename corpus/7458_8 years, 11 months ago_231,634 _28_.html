Is there a benefit to using one over the other? In Python 2, they both seem to return the same results:In Python 3.0, 5 / 2 will return 2.5 and 5 // 2 will return 2.  The former is floating point division, and the latter is floor division, sometimes also called integer division.In Python 2.2 or later in the 2.x line, there is no difference for integers unless you perform a from __future__ import division, which causes Python 2.x to adopt the behavior of 3.0Regardless of the future import, 5.0 // 2 will return 2.0 since that\'s the floor division result of the operation.You can find a detailed description at https://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.2.html#pep-238-changing-the-division-operatorIt helps to clarify for the Python 2.x line, / is neither floor division nor true division. The current accepted answer is not clear on this. / is floor division when both args are int, but is true division when either or both of the args are float.The above tells a lot more truth, and is a lot more clearer than the 2nd paragraph in the accepted answer.As everyone has already answered, // is floor division.Why this is important is that // is unambiguously floor division, in all Python versions from 2.2, including Python 3.x versions.The behavior of / can change depending on:// implements "floor division", regardless of your type. So\n1.0/2.0 will give 0.5, but both 1/2, 1//2 and 1.0//2.0 will give 0.See https://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.2.html#pep-238-changing-the-division-operator for details/  --> Floating point division// --> Floor divisionLets see some examples in both python 2.7 and in Python 3.5.Python 2.7.10 vs. Python 3.5 Python 2.7.10 vs. Python 3.5 Now if you want to have (in python 2.7) same output as in python 3.5, you can do the following: Python 2.7.10 Where as there is no differece between Floor division in both python 2.7 and in Python 3.5Please refer The Problem with Integer Division for the reason for introducing the // operator to do integer division.The double slash, //, is floor division:****\n/ Division\nDivides left hand operand by right hand operand\nex::\n4 / 2 = 2Floor Division(//) - The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed. But if one of the operands is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity):\nexamples:\n9//2 = 4 and 9.0//2.0 = 4.0, -11//3 = -4, -11.0//3 = -4.0Both / Division and // floor division operator are operating in similar fashionThe answer of the equation is rounded to the next smaller integer or float with .0 as decimal point. // is floor division, it will always give you the integer floor of the result.  The other is \'regular\' division.
