I have a JSON file that is a mess that I want to prettyprint-- what\'s the easiest way to do this in python? I know PrettyPrint takes an "object", which I think can be a file, but I don\'t know how to pass a file in-- just using the filename doesn\'t work.The json module already implements some basic pretty printing with the indent parameter:To parse a file, use json.load:You can do this on the command line:(as already mentioned in the commentaries to the question).Actually python is not my favourite tool as far as json processing on the command line is concerned. For simple pretty printing is ok, but if you want to manipulate the json it can become overcomplicated. You\'d soon need to write a separate script-file, you could end up with maps whose keys are u"some-key" (python unicode), which makes selecting fields more difficult and doesn\'t really go in the direction of pretty-printing.I use jq. The above can be done with:and you get colors as a bonus (and way easier extendability).Pygmentize is a killer tool. See this.I combine python json.tool with pygmentizeSee the link above for pygmentize installation instruction.A demo of this is in the image below:Use this function and don\'t sweat having to remember if your JSON is a str or dict again - just look at the pretty print:To be able to pretty print from the command line and be able to have control over the indentation etc. you can set up an alias similar to this:And then use the alias in one of these ways:
