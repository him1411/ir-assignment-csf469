Top answers got me in the right direction.The current (2 Oct 16) Bootstrap 3 css Sticky footer (Fixed size) looks like this:As long as the footer has a fixed size, the body margin-bottom creates a push to allow a pocket for the footer to sit in. In this case, both are set to 60px. But if the footer is not fixed and exceeds 60px height, it will cover your page content.Make Flexible: Delete the css body margin and footer height. Then add JavaScript to get the footer height and set the body marginBottom. That is done with the setfooter() function. Next add event listeners for when the page first loads and on resizing that run the setfooter. Note: If you footer has an accordion or anything else that triggers a size change, without a resize of window, you must call the setfooter() function again.Run the snippet and then fullscreen to demo it.To Summarize all of these, just keep one thing in your mind that everything except footer should have min-height: 100% or little less.I write my simplified sticky footer code with padding using LESS.

You should also write some javascript:It will prevent content overlapping by the fixed footer, and it will adjust the padding-bottom when the user changes the window/screen size.In the script above I assumed that footer is placed directly inside the body tag like that:This is definitely not the best solution (because of the JS which could be avoided), but it works without any issues with overlapping, it is easy to implement and responsive (height is not hardcoded in CSS).Here is a very simple and clean sticky footer you can use in bootstrap.

If you download their sticky-footer-navbar example and place a large amount of content in the main body area the footer will get pushed down past the bottom of the viewport. It isn\'t sticky at all.Using flexbox is the easiest way I have found, from the guys of CSS-tricks.
