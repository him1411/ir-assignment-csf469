Every time I try to open Eclipse in Ubuntu 12.04 I get an Unsatisfied Link Error and it will not open. I have recently installed the java JDK and Android SDK, could this be the problem? I followed this tutorial.Here is the log info:I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and removing the ~/.eclipse directory but it still doesn\'t workon my Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit. I edit the command to: And on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit try: SOLVED:Because I had installed the Oracle Java 7 it had changed the default Java to Oracle Java 7, however it needed to be the Open JDK.To fix, open up terminal and typeThis brings up a list of the different types of Java.

I had to cd to the /home/*/.swt/lib/linux/x86_64/ 0 filesdirectory first and then run the link command: For 32 bit:And on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit:If you start eclipse using oracle java, then eclipse might fail in finding native libraries like SWT or SVN libraries. The SWT-JNI libraries are located in /usr/lib/jni/ and the SVN-JNI libraries are located in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/jni/.Instead of starting eclipse with the commandyou can use the commandto pass the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to eclipse. Eclipse will find the native libraries and will run properly.On redhat7 :did the job, because of a swt dependency.found herePlease make sure that your home partition is mounted with executable permissions. That is the default, but if you happen to mount it without exec option, you will get this error.I came across this error when tried to start 32-bit build of Eclipse under 64-bit linux. The problem was solved after installing ia32-libs package.A possibly more generic method is to:I installed the JDK 32 bit because of that I am getting the errors. After installing JDK 64 bit http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html\njdk-8u131-linux-x64.tar.gz(please download the 64 version)\nand download  64 bit "eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz".
