I have a large data set and I would like to read specific columns or drop all the others.I select the columns that I\'m not interested in:and than I\'d like to do something like:to drop all the unwanted columns. Is this the optimal solution?You should use either indexing or the subset function. For example :Then you can use the which function and the - operator in column indexation :Or, much simpler, use the select argument of the subset function : you can then use the - operator directly on a vector of column names, and you can even omit the quotes around the names !Note that you can also select the columns you want instead of dropping the others :Do not use -which() for this, it is extremely dangerous. Consider:Instead use subset or the ! function:I have learned this from painful experience. Do not overuse which()!First, you can use direct indexing (with booleans vectors) instead of re-accessing column names if you are working with the same data frame; it will be safer as pointed out by Ista, and quicker to write and to execute. So what you will only need is:and then, simply reassign data:Second, quicker to write, you can directly assign NULL to the columns you want to remove:Finally, you can use subset(), but it cannot really be used in the code (even the help file warns about it). Specifically, a problem to me is that if you want to directly use the drop feature of susbset() you need to write without quotes the expression corresponding to the column names:As a bonus, here is small benchmark of the different options, that clearly shows that subset is the slower, and that the first, reassigning method is the faster:Code is below :You can also try the dplyr package:I tried to delete a column while using the package data.table and got an unexpected result.  I kind of think the following might be worth posting.  Just a little cautionary note.[ Edited by Matthew ... ]Basically, the syntax for data.table is NOT exactly the same as data.frame. There are in fact lots of differences, see FAQ 1.1 and FAQ 2.17.  You have been warned!Here\'s a quick solution for this. Say, you have a data frame X with three columns A, B and C:If I want to remove a column, say B, just use grep on colnames to get the column index, which you can then use to omit the column.Your new X data frame would look like the following (this time without the B column):The beauty of grep is that you can specify multiple columns that match the regular expression. If I had X with five columns (A,B,C,D,E):Take out columns B and D:EDIT: Considering the grepl suggestion of Matthew Lundberg in the comments below:If I try to drop a column that\'s non-existent,nothing should happen:Here is another solution that may be helpful to others.  The code below selects a small number of rows and columns from a large data set.  The columns are selected as in one of juba\'s answers except that I use a paste function to select a set of columns with names that are numbered sequentially:I changed the code to:Anyway, juba\'s answer is the best solution to my problem!I can\xc2\xb4t answer your question in the comments due to low reputation score.The next code will give you an error because the paste function return a character stringHere is a possible solution:or just do:
