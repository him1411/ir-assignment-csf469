I have a rake task that needs to insert a value into multiple databases.  I\'d like to pass this value into the rake task from the command line, or from another rake task.How can I do this?options and dependencies need to be inside arrays:ThenNOTE: variable t is short for task. It is the the task object, not very helpful unless you know what you\'re doing. You can specify formal arguments in rake by adding symbol arguments to the task call.  For example:Then, from the command line:As demonstrated in the second example, if you want to use spaces, the quotes around the target name are necessary to keep the shell from splitting up the arguments at the space.Looking at the code in rake.rb, it appears that rake does not parse task strings to extract arguments for prerequisites, so you can\'t do task :t1 => "dep[1,2]".  The only way to specify different arguments for a prerequisite would be to invoke it explicitly within the dependent task action, as in :invoke_my_task and :invoke_my_task_2.Note that some shells (like zsh) require you to escape the brackets: rake my_task\\[\'arg1\'\\]In addition to answer by kch (I didn\'t find how to leave a comment to that, sorry):You don\'t have to specify variables as ENV variables before the rake command. You can just set them as usual command line parameters like that:and access those from you rake file as ENV variables like such:If you want to pass named arguments (e.g. with standard OptionParser) you could use something like this:note the --, that\'s necessary for bypassing standard Rake arguments. Should work with Rake 0.9.x, <= 10.3.x.Newer Rake has changed its parsing of --, and now you have to make sure it\'s not passed to the OptionParser#parse method, for example with parser.parse!(ARGV[2..-1])exit at the end will make sure that the extra arguments won\'t be interpreted as Rake task. Also the shortcut for arguments should work:When rake scripts look like this, maybe it\'s time to look for another tool that would allow this just out of box.I\'ve found the answer from these two websites: Net Maniac and Aimred.You need to have version > 0.8 of rake to use this techniqueThe normal rake task description is this:To pass arguments, do three things:To access the arguments in the script, use args.arg_nameTo call this task from the command line, pass it the arguments in []swill outputand if you want to call this task from another task, and pass it arguments, use invokethen the commandwill outputI haven\'t found a way to pass arguments as part of a dependency, as the following code breaks:Another commonly used option is to pass environment variables. In your code you read them via ENV[\'VAR\'], and can pass them right before the rake command, likeActually @Nick Desjardins answered perfect. But just for education: you can use dirty approach: using ENV argumentI couldn\'t figure out how to pass args and also the :environment until I worked this out:And then I call like this:I use a regular ruby argument in the rake file:then I stub out the rake tasks at the bottom of the file (since rake will look for a task based on that argument name).command line:this feels cleaner to me than the var=foo ENV var and the task args[blah, blah2] solutions.\nthe stub is a little jenky, but not too bad if you just have a few environments that are a one-time setupI just wanted to be able to run:Simple, right? (Nope!)Rake interprets arg1 and arg2 as tasks, and tries to run them. So we just abort before it does.Take that, brackets!Disclaimer: I wanted to be able to do this in a pretty small pet project. Not intended for "real world" usage since you lose the ability to chain rake tasks (i.e. rake task1 task2 task3). IMO not worth it. Just use the ugly rake task[arg1,arg2].The ways to pass argument are correct in above answer. However to run  rake task with arguments, there is a small technicality involved in newer version of railsIt will work with rake "namespace:taskname[\'argument1\']"Note the Inverted quotes in running the task from command line. To pass arguments to the default task, you can do something like this. For example, say \n"version" is your argument:Then you can call it like so:or orHowever, I have not found a way to avoid specifying the task name (default or build) while passing in arguments. Would love to hear if anyone knows of a way.I like the "querystring" syntax for argument passing, especially when there are a lot of arguments to be passed. Example:The "querystring" being:Warning: note that the syntax is rake "mytask[foo=bar]" and NOT rake mytask["foo=bar"]When parsed inside the rake task using Rack::Utils.parse_nested_query , we get a Hash:(The cool thing is that you can pass hashes and arrays, more below)This is how to achieve this:Here\'s a more extended example that I\'m using with Rails in my delayed_job_active_record_threaded gem:Parsed the same way as above, with an environment dependency (in order load the Rails environment)Gives the following in optionsMost of the methods described above did not work for me, maybe they are deprecated in the newer versions.\nThe up-to-date guide can be found here: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#custom-rake-tasksa copy-and-paste ans from the guide is here:Invoke it like thisIf you can\'t be bothered to remember what argument position is for what and you want do something like a ruby argument hash. You can use one argument to pass in a string and then regex that string into an options hash.  And on the command line you get.While passing parameters, it is better option is an input file, can this be a excel a json or whatever you need and from there read the data structure and variables you need from that including the variable name as is the need.\nTo read a file can have the following structure.
