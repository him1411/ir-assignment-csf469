When I\'ve worked a bit with my source code, I did my usual thing commit and then I pushed to a remote repository. But then I noticed I forgot to organize my imports in the source code. So I do the amend command to replace the previous commit:Unfortunately the commit can\'t be pushed back to the repository. It is rejected like this:What should I do? (I can access the remote repository.)I actually once pushed with --force and .git repository and got scolded by Linus BIG TIME.  In general this will create a lot of problems for other people. A simple answer is "Don\'t do it".I see others gave the recipe for doing so anyway, so I won\'t repeat them here. But here is a tip to recover from the situation after you have pushed out the amended commit with --force (or +master).Then people who were unfortunate enough to have based their work on the commit you obliterated by amending and forcing a push (which is you\'re being a very very bad boy) will see the resulting merge will see that you favor new over old. Their later merges will not see the conflicts between old and new that resulted from your amending, so they do not have to suffer.What you are seeing is a git safety feature. git refuses to update the remote branch with your branch because your branch\'s head commit is not a direct descendent of the current head commit of the branch that you are pushing to.If this were not the case, then two people pushing to the same repository at about the same time would not know that there was a new commit coming in at the same time and whoever pushed last would lose the work of the previous pusher without either of them realising this.If you know that you are the only person pushing and you want to push an amended commit or push a commit that winds back the branch, you can \'force\' git to update the remote branch by using the -f switch.Even this may not work as git allows remote repositories to refuse non-fastforward pushes at the far end by using the config variable receive.denynonfastforwards. If this is the case the rejection reason will look like this (note the \'remote rejected\' part):To get around this, you either need to change the remote repository\'s config or as a dirty hack you can delete and recreate the branch thus:In general the last parameter to git push uses the format <local_ref>:<remote_ref>, where local_ref is the name of the branch on the local repository and remote_ref is the name of the branch on the remote repository. This command pair uses two shorthands. :master has a null local_ref which means push a null branch to the remote side master, i.e. delete the remote branch. A branch name with no : means push the local branch with the given name to the remote branch with the same name. master in this situation is short for master:master.Quick rant: The fact that no-one has posted the simple answer here demonstrates the desperate user-hostility exhibited by the Git CLI.Anyway, the "obvious" way to do this, assuming you haven\'t tried to force the push, is to pull first. This pulls the change that you ammended (and so no longer have) so that you have it again.Once you have resolved any conflicts, you can push again.So:If you get errors in pull, maybe something is wrong in your local repo config (I had a wrong ref in .git/config branch section)And afterMaybe you will get an extra commit with subject telling about a "Trivial merge"Short answer: Don\'t push amended commits to a public repo.Long answer: A few Git commands, like git commit --amend and git rebase, actually rewrite the history graph. This is fine as long as you haven\'t published your changes, but once you do, you really shouldn\'t be mucking around with the history, because if someone already got your changes, then when they try to pull again, it might fail. Instead of amending a commit, you should just make a new commit with the changes.However, if you really, really want to push an amended commit, you can do so like this:The leading + sign will force the push to occur, even if it doesn\'t result in a "fast-forward" commit. (A fast-forward commit occurs when the changes you are pushing are a direct descendant of the changes already in the public repo.)Here is a very simple and clean way to push your changes after you have already made a commit --amend:Which does the following:I have solved it by discarding my local amended commit and adding the new changes on top:Had the same problem.As a GIT-newbie, I thought it was comlpete fubar.Solution: somewhat like @bara suggested + created a local backup branchMaybe its not a fast and clean solution and I lost my history (1 commit instead of 5), but it saved a day\'s work.Here is a very simple and clean way to push your changes after you have already made a git add "your files" and git commit --amend:or:If you\'re not pushed the code to your remote branch(Github/Bitbucket) you can change the commit message on the command line as below.If you\'re working on a specific branch do this.If you\'ve already pushed the code with wrong message then you need to be careful when changing the message. i.e after you change the commit message and try pushing it again you end up with having issues. To make it smooth follow these steps.\nPlease read the entire answer before doing itImportant note: When you use the force push directly you might end up with code issues that other developers are working on the same branch. So to avoid that conflicts you need to pull the code from your branch before making the force pushThis is the best practice when changing the commit message, if it was already pushed.If you know nobody has pulled your un-amended commit. Use the --force-with-lease option of git push.In TortoiseGit, you can do the same thing under "Push..." options "Force: May discard" and checking "known changes".Force (May discard known changes) allows remote repository to accept a safer non-fast-forward push. This can cause the remote repository to lose commits; use it with care. This can prevent from losing unknown changes from other people on the remote. It checks if the server branch points to the same commit as the remote-tracking branch (known changes). If yes, a force push will be performed. Otherwise it will be rejected. Since git does not have remote-tracking tags, tags cannot be overwritten using this option.I had to fix this problem with pulling from the remote repo and deal with the merge conflicts that arose, commit and then push. But I feel like there is a better way.You are getting this error because the git remote already have this commit files. You have to force push the branch for this to work.Also make sure you pull the code from remote as someone else on your team might have pushed to same branch.This is one of the cases where we have to force push the commit to remote.I just kept doing what git told me to do. So:Note: the amended commit was the latest one.
