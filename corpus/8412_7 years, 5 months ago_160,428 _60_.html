How do I print coloured characters to a Linux terminal that supports it?How do I tell whether the terminal supports colour codes?I\'m using C++ for this program.You need to output ANSI colour codes. Note that not all terminals support this; if colour sequences are not supported, garbage will show up.Example:Here, \\033 is the ESC character, ASCII 27. It is followed by [, then zero or more numbers separated by ;, and finally the letter m. The numbers describe the colour and format to switch to from that point onwards.The codes for foreground and background colours are:Additionally, you can use these:See the table on Wikipedia for other, less widely supported codes.Edit: To determine whether your terminal supports colour sequences, read the value of the TERM environment variable. It should specify the particular terminal type used (e.g. vt100, gnome-terminal, xterm, screen, ...). Then look that up in the terminfo database; check the colors capability.I have written a C++ class which can be used to set the foreground and background color of output. This sample program serves as an example of printing This ->word<- is red. and formatting it so that the foreground color of word is red.You may want to add additional features to the class. It is, for example, possible to add the color magenta and even styles like boldface. To do this, just an another entry to the Code enumeration. This is a good reference.Before you going to output any color you need make sure you are in a terminal:Then you need to check terminal capability if it support coloron systems with terminfo (Linux based) you can obtain quantity of supported colors ason systems with termcap (BSD based) you can obtain quantity of supported colors asThen make you decision:BTW, do not use coloring as it was suggested before with ESC characters.\nUse standard call to terminal capability that will assign you CORRECT colors that particular terminal support.As others have stated, you can use escape characters.\nYou can use my header in order to make it easier:An example using the macros of the header could be:This is an old topic, but I wrote a class with nested subclasses and static members for colors defined by simple C macros.I got the color function from this post Color Text In C Programming in dreamincode.net by user no2pencil.I made it this way so to be able to use the static constants in std::cout stream like this:The class and a test program source code can be downloaded here.cc::console will reset to console default colors and attributes, cc::underline will underline the text, which works on putty which I\'ve tested the test program.Colors:Which can be used with both fore and back static subclasses of the cc static class.EDIT 2017I\'m just adding the class code here to be more practical.The color code macros:and the main color function that defines a color or an attribute to the screen:ccolor.hccolor.cppYou can use escape sequences, if your terminal supports it. For example:I use the following solution, it\'s quite simple and elegant, can be easily pasted into source, and works on Linux/Bash:You can use ANSI colour codes.use these functions.The best way is to use the ncurses library - though this might be a sledgehammer to crack a nut if you just want to output a simple coloured stringtry my header here for a quick and easy way to color text: Aedi\'s Color HeaderColor Your Output in Unix using C++!!General Format, include value you want in $variable$e.g.Just use  to stream the color you want before outputting text and\nuse  again to set the color to normal after outputting text.on OSX shell, this works for me (including 2 spaces in front of "red text"):From my understanding, a typical ANSI color code    is composed of (name and codec)FORMAT ATTRIBUTEFORGROUND COLORBACKGROUND COLORTEXT RESET FORMAT ATTRIBUTEWith this information, it is easy to colorize a string "I am a banana!" with forground color "Yellow" and background color "Green" like thisOr with a C++ library colorizeMore examples with FORMAT ATTRIBUTE here
