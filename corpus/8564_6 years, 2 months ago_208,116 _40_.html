I\'m trying to use the command line program convert to take a PDF into an image (JPEG or PNG). Here is one of the PDFs that I\'m trying to convert. I want the program to trim off the excess white-space and return a high enough quality image that the superscripts can be read with ease.This is my current best attempt. As you can see, the trimming works fine, I just need to sharpen up the resolution quite a bit. This is the command I\'m using: I\'ve tried to make the following conscious decisions:Any suggestions please on getting the resolution of the image in the final PNG/JPEG higher would be greatly appreciated!It appears that the following works: It results in the left image. Compare this to the result of my original command (the image on the right):  (To really see and appreciate the differences between the two, right-click on each and select "Open Image in New Tab...".)Also keep the following facts in mind:So, no need to resize; add the -density flag. The density value 150 is weird -- trying a range of values results in a worse looking image in both directions!Personally I like this.It\'s a little over twice the file size, but it looks better to me.-density 300 sets the dpi that the PDF is rendered at.-trim removes any edge pixels that are the same color as the corner pixels.-quality 100 sets the JPEG compression quality to the highest quality.Things like -sharpen don\'t work well with text because they undo things your font rendering system did to make it more legible.If you actually want it blown up use resize here and possibly a larger dpi value of something like targetDPI * scalingFactor  That will render the PDF at the resolution/size you intend.Descriptions of the parameters on imagemagick.org are hereI use pdftoppm on the command line to get the initial image, typically with a resolution of 300dpi, so pdftoppm -r 300, then use convert to do the trimming and PNG conversion.I have found it both faster and more stable when batch-processing large PDFs into PNGs and JPGs to use the underlying gs (aka Ghostscript) command that convert uses.You can see the command in the output of convert -verbose and there are a few more tweaks possible there (YMMV) that are difficult / impossible to access directly via convert.However, it would be harder to do your trimming and sharpening using gs, so, as I said, YMMV!normally I extract the embedded image with \'pdfimages\' at the native resolution, then use ImageMagick\'s convert to the needed format:this generate the best and smallest result file.Note: For lossy JPG embedded images, you had to use -j:On little provided Win platform you had to download a recent (0.37 2015)  \'poppler-util\' binary from:\nhttp://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/It also gives you good results:One more suggestion is that you can use GIMP. Just load the PDF file in GIMP->save as .xcf and then you can do whatever you want to the image.PNG file you attached looks really blurred. In case if you need to use additional post-processing for each image you generated as PDF preview, you will decrease performance of your solution.2JPEG can convert PDF file you attached to a nice sharpen JPG and crop empty margins in one call:Linux user here: I tried the convert command-line utility (for PDF to PNG) and I was not happy with the results.  I found this to be easier, with a better result:Edit: added picture, per request in Comments. Convert command used:convert -density 300 -trim struct2vec.pdf -quality 100 struct2vec.pngGIMP : imported at 300 dpi (px/in); exported as PNG compression level 3.I have not used GIMP on the command line (re: my comment, below).Use this commandline:This should correctly convert the file as you\'ve asked for.
