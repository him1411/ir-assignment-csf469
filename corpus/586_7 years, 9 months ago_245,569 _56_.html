How do I use Git and Dropbox together effectively?I think that Git on Dropbox is great. I use it all of the time. I have multiple computers (two at home and one at work) that I use Dropbox as a central bare repository. Since I don\'t want to host it on a public service, and I don\'t have access to a server that I can always ssh to, Dropbox takes care of this by syncing (very quickly) in the background.Setup is something like this:From there, you can just clone ~/Dropbox/git/project.git that you have associated with your Dropbox account (or have shared this directory with people), you can do all the normal Git operations and they will be synchronised to all your other machines automatically.I wrote a blog post, On Version Control, (old link dead) on my reasoning and how I set up my environment, it\'s based on my Ruby on Rails development experience, but it can be applied to anything, really.This answer is based on Mercurial experience, not Git, but this experience says using Dropbox this way is asking for corrupt repositories if there\'s even a chance that you\'ll be updating the same Dropbox-based repository from different machines at various times (Mac, Unix, Windows in my case).I don\'t have a complete list of the things that can go wrong, but here\'s a specific example that bit me. Each machine has its own notion of line-ending characters and how upper/lower case characters are handled in file names. Dropbox and Git/Mercurial handle this slightly differently (I don\'t recall the exact differences). If Dropbox updates the repository behind Git/Mercurial\'s back, presto, broken repository. This happens immediately and invisibly, so you don\'t even know your repository is broken until you try to recover something from it.After digging out from one mess doing things this way, I\'ve been using the following recipe with great success and no sign of problems. Simply move your repository out of Dropbox. Use Dropbox for everything else; documentation, JAR files, anything you please. And use GitHub (Git) or Bitbucket (Mercurial) to manage the repository itself. Both are free so this adds nothing to the costs, and each tool now plays to its strengths. Running Git/Mercurial on top of Dropbox adds nothing except risk. Don\'t do it. The right way to do this is use git-remote-dropbox: https://github.com/anishathalye/git-remote-dropboxCreating your own bare repo in Dropbox causes a lot of problems. Anish (the creator of the library) explains it best:The root cause of these problems is that the Dropbox desktop\n  client is designed for syncing files, not Git repositories. Without\n  special handling for Git repositories, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t maintain the same\n  guarantees as Git. Operations on the remote repository are no longer\n  atomic, and concurrent operations or unlucky timing with\n  synchronization can result in a corrupted repository.Traditional Git remotes run code on the server side to make this work\n  properly, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.Solution: It is possible to solve this properly. It is possible to use\n  Git with Dropbox and have the same safety and consistency guarantees\n  as a traditional Git remote, even when there are multiple users and\n  concurrent operations!For a user, it\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as using git-remote-dropbox, a Git remote\n  helper that acts as a transparent bidirectional bridge between Git and\n  Dropbox and maintains all the guarantees of a traditional Git remote.\n  It\xe2\x80\x99s even safe to use with shared folders, so it can be used for\n  collaboration (yay unlimited private repos with unlimited\n  collaborators!).With the remote helper, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to use Dropbox as a Git remote\n  and continue using all the regular Git commands like git clone, git\n  pull, and git push, and everything will just work as expected.I don\'t think that using Git and Dropbox is the way to go... Just think about the features of both:Git:Dropbox:And if you\'re worried with sharing some of your files, why not cipher them? And then you could get the biggest advantage of Dropbox to Git, that is, to have public and private files...I didn\'t want to put all my projects under one Git repository, nor did I want to go in and run this code for every single project, so I made a Bash script that will automate the process. You can use it on one or multiple directories - so it can do the code in this post for you or it can do it on multiple projects at once.With regards to small teams using Dropbox:If each developer has their own writable bare repository on Dropbox, which is pull only to other developers, then this facilitates code sharing with no risk of corruption!Then if you want a centralized \'mainline\', you can have one developer manage all the pushes to it from their own repo.It is now 2015, and as of three days ago, a new tool based on Dropbox API v2 has been created to safely use git on Dropbox. It works against the API rather than using the desktop client, and correctly handles multiple simultaneous pushes to a repository hosted in a shared folder. Once configured, it allows one to set up a git remote exactly like any other git remote.I\'ve been using Mercurial in the recommended manner and urge that you be cautious, especially if any of the machines differ. The Dropbox fora are full of complaints of mysterious filename case problems turning up spontaneously. Hg (and I presume Git) won\'t notice or complain during routine checkins and you\'ll only hear about the corruption when it complains of a corrupt repo when you try to use it for real. Bad news. Wish I could be more specific about the problem and its workarounds; I\'m still trying to dig out from this mess myself.I love the answer by Dan McNevin! I\'m using Git and Dropbox together too now, and I\'m using several aliases in my .bash_profile so my workflow looks like this:These are my aliases:I use Mercurial (or Git) + TrueCrypt + Dropbox for encrypted remote backups.The coolest thing is that Dropbox does NOT sync the entire TrueCrypt container if you modify a small portion of your code. The sync time is roughly proportional to the amount of changes. Even though it\'s encrypted, the combination of TrueCrypt + Dropbox makes excellent usage of block cipher + block level sync.Secondly, a monolithic encrypted container not just adds security, it also reduces chances of repository corruption . Caution: However you have to be very careful about not having the container mounted while Dropbox is running. It can also be a pain to resolve conflicts if 2 different clients check-in different versions to the container. So, it\'s practical only for a single person using it for backups, not for a team.Setup:Usage:P.S. Unchecking the preserve modification timestamp tells dropbox that the file has been modified and it should be sync\'d. Note that mounting the container modifies the timestamp even if you don\'t change any file in it. If you don\'t want that to happen, simply mount the volume as read-onlyWe use this method (creating a bare repository in Dropbox) on a share folder. A small group of developers can pull from that bare synced repository and create a local clone. Once the unit of work is done, we push back to origin.One thing I\'m missing is a good way to have an e-mail sent with the change-set information once a push to origin occurs. We are using Google Wave to manually keep track of changes. There\'s also an open source project (a collection of cross platform [Linux, Mac, Win] scripts) that does all the nitty-gritty details of the repository management with a handful (3-4) of commands.https://github.com/karalabe/gitbox/wikiSample usage is:After which normal git usage:Check the project wiki and the manuals for full command reference and tutorials. I store my non-Github repo\'s on Dropbox.  One caveat I ran into was syncing after a reinstall.  Dropbox will download the smallest files first before moving to the larger ones.  Not an issue if you start at night and come back after the weekend :-)My thread - http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=29984&replies=6I like the top-voted answer by Dan McNevin. I ended up doing the sequence of git commands too many times and decided to make a script. So here it is:The script only requires a project name. It will generate a git repository in ~/Dropbox/git/ under the specified name and will push the entire contents of the current directory to the newly created origin master branch. If more than one project name is given, the right-most project name argument will be used. Optionally, the -r command argument specifies the remote branch that will push to the origin master. The location of the project origin master can also be specified with the -m argument. A default .gitignore file is also placed in the remote branch directory. The directory and .gitignore file defaults are specified in the script. Now in 2014, I have been using Git and Dropbox for about one year and a half without problem.\nSome points though:I have faced a similar issue and have created a small script for the same. The idea is to use Dropbox with Git as simply as possible. Currently, I have quickly implemented Ruby code, and I will soon add more. The script is accessible at https://github.com/nuttylabs/box-git.Without using third-party integration tools, I could enhance the condition a bit and use DropBox and other similar cloud disk services such as SpiderOak with Git.The goal is to avoid the synchronization in the middle of these files modifications, as it can upload a partial state and will then download it back, completely corrupting your git state.To avoid this issue, I did:It\'s not perfect as there is no guarantee it won\'t mess up the git state again, but it helps and for the moment I did not get any issue.
