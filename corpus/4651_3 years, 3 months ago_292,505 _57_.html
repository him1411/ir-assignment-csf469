I have been working to create a UIAlertView in Swift, but for some reason I can\'t get the statement right because I\'m getting this error: Could not find an overload for \'init\' that accepts the supplied\n  argumentsHere is how I have it written:Then to call it I\'m using:As of right now it is crashing and I just can\'t seem to get the syntax right. From the UIAlertView class:// UIAlertView is deprecated. Use UIAlertController with a\n  preferredStyle of UIAlertControllerStyleAlert insteadOn iOS 8, you can do this:Now UIAlertController is a single class for creating and interacting with what we knew as UIAlertViews and UIActionSheets on iOS 8.Edit: To handle actions:Edit for Swift 3:Updated for Swift 3The handler was nil in the above examples. You can replace nil with a closure to do something when the user taps a button. For example:You can create a UIAlert using the standard constructor, but the \'legacy\' one seems to not work:Click of View Done with two buttons OK & CancelIf you\'re targeting iOS 7 and 8, you need something like this to make sure you\'re using the right method for each version, because UIAlertView is deprecated in iOS 8, but UIAlertController is not available in iOS 7:Simply do not provide otherButtonTitles in the constructor.But I do agree with Oscar, this class is deprecated in iOS 8, so there won\'t be no use of UIAlertView if you\'re doing an iOS 8 only app. Otherwise the code above will work.Show UIAlertView in swift language :-Protocol UIAlertViewDelegateShow UIAlertViewController in swift language :-I found this one,not good though, but it works :)Update:but I have found on header file as:somebody may can explain this.With the protocol extensions of Swift 2, you can make a protocol that provides a default implementation to your view controllers:ShowsAlert.swiftViewController.swiftI have another trick. Suppose you have 5 classes where a logout alert to be applied. Try with swift class extension.File- New- Swift class- Name it.Add the following:    Implement using :  self.makeLogOutAlert(). Hope it helps.Swift 3The following is a simple example of how to create a simple alert with one button with Swift 3.In the above example the handle callback of the action has been omitted because the default behaviour of an alert view with one button is to disappear when the button is clicked.Here is how to create another action, which could be added to the alert with "alert.addAction(action)". The different styles are .default, .destructive and .cancel.I got the following UIAlertView initialization code to compile without errors (I thing the last, varyadic part is tricky perhaps). But I had to make sure the class of self (which I am passing as the delegate) was adopting the UIAlertViewDelegate protocol for the compile errors to go away:By the way, this is the error I was getting (as of Xcode 6.4):Cannot find an initializer for type \'UIAlertView\' that accepts an\n  argument list of type \'(title: String, message: String, delegate:\n  MyViewController, cancelButtonTitle: String, otherButtonTitles:\n  String)\'As others mentioned, you should migrate to UIAlertController if you can target iOS 8.x+. To support iOS 7, use the code above (iOS 6 is not supported by Swift).I have made a singleton class to make this convenient to use from anywhere in your app: https://github.com/Swinny1989/Swift-PopupsYou can then create a popup with multiple buttons like this:or popups with a single button like this:The reason it doesn\'t work because some value you passed to the function isn\'t correct. swift doesn\'t like Objective-C, you can put nil to arguments which are class type without any restriction(might be). Argument otherButtonTitles is defined as non-optional which its type do not have (?)at its end. so you must pass a concrete value to it.Try thisUse this code to display an alertview Reference: Swift Show Alert using UIAlertControllerHere is a funny example in Swift:Here is a pretty simple function of AlertView in Swift :You have to pass message as a String where you use this function.The Old Way: UIAlertViewThe New Way: UIAlertController
