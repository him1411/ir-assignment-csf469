I have a function that returns five characters with mixed case. If I do a query on this string it will return the value regardless of case.How can I make MySQL string queries case sensitive?http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/case-sensitivity.htmlThe default character set and collation are latin1 and latin1_swedish_ci, so nonbinary string comparisons are case insensitive by default. This means that if you search with col_name  LIKE \'a%\', you get all column values that start with A or a. To make this search case sensitive, make sure that one of the operands has a case sensitive or binary collation. For example, if you are comparing a column and a string that both have the latin1 character set, you can use the COLLATE operator to cause either operand to have the latin1_general_cs or latin1_bin collation:If you want a column always to be treated in case-sensitive fashion, declare it with a case sensitive or binary collation.The good news is that if you need to make a case-sensitive query, it is very easy to do:Instead of using the = operator, you may want to use LIKE or LIKE BINARY It will take \'a\' and not \'A\' in its conditionTo make use of an index before using the BINARY, you could do something like this if you have large tables.The subquery would result in a really small case-insensitive subset of which you then select the only case-sensitive match. Answer posted Craig White, has big performance penalty because it don\'t use indexes. So, either you need to change the table collation like mention here https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/case-sensitivity.html. OREasiest fix, you should use a BINARY of value.Eg. VS 1 row in set (0.00 sec)Following is for MySQL versions equal to or higher than 5.5.Add to /etc/mysql/my.cnfAll other collations I tried seemed to be case-insensitive, only "utf8_bin" worked.Do not forget to restart mysql after this:According to http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/case-sensitivity.html there is also a "latin1_bin".The "utf8_general_cs" was not accepted by mysql startup. (I read "_cs" as "case-sensitive" - ???).You can use BINARY to case sensitive like thisunfortunately this sql can\'t use index, you will suffer a performance hit on queries reliant on that indexFortunately, I have a few tricks to solve this problemmysql is not case sensitive by default, try changing the language collation to latin1_general_cs Excellent!I share with you, code from a function that compares passwords:No need to changes anything on DB level, just you have to changes in SQL Query it will work.Example -"SELECT * FROM <TABLE> where userId = \'" + iv_userId + "\' AND password = BINARY \'" + iv_password + "\'";Binary keyword will make case sensitive.Typically this is how your LIKE query is like(You see what i did there ;-) ):SELECT * FROM  WHERE  LIKE \'%%\'Now, to do a case case-insensitive query you can use the LOWER() function:SELECT * FROM  WHERE LOWER() LIKE LOWER(\'%%\');That will help you avoid getting your hands dirty with COLLATE formats and stuff... You know what i\'m saying?
