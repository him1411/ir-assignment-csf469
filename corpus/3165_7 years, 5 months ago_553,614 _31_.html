I know I\'ve done this before years ago, but I can\'t remember the syntax, and I can\'t find it anywhere due to pulling up tons of help docs and articles about "bulk imports".Here\'s what I want to do, but the syntax is not exactly right... please, someone who has done this before, help me out :)I know that this is close to the right syntax. I might need the word "BULK" in there, or something, I can\'t remember. Any idea?I need this for a SQL Server 2005 database. I\'ve tried this code, to no avail:I\'m getting Incorrect syntax near the keyword \'VALUES\'.For SQL Server 2008, can do it in one VALUES clause exactly as per the statement in your question (you just need to add a comma to separate each values statement)...Your syntax almost works in SQL Server 2008 (but not in SQL Server 20051):1 When the question was answered, it was not made evident that the question was referring to SQL Server 2005. I am leaving this answer here, since I believe it is still relevant.If your data is already in your database you can do:If you need to hard code the data then SQL 2008 and later versions let you do the following...You could do this (ugly but it works):You can use a union:This looks OK for SQL Server 2008.  For SS2005 & earlier, you need to repeat the VALUES statement.EDIT:: My bad. You have to repeat the \'INSERT INTO\' for each row in SS2005.Corresponding to INSERT (Transact-SQL) (SQL Server 2005) you can\'t omit INSERT INTO dbo.Blah and have to specify it every time or use another syntax/approach,It would be easier to use XML in SQL Server to insert multiple rows otherwise it becomes very tedious.View full article with code explanations here http://www.cyberminds.co.uk/blog/articles/how-to-insert-multiple-rows-in-sql-server.aspxCopy the following code into sql server to view a sample.I\'ve been using the following:It will add ten rows with unique GUIDs for ID and Name.Note: do not end the last line (GO 10) with \';\' because it will throw error: A fatal scripting error occurred. Incorrect syntax was encountered while parsing GO.This is working very fast,and efficient in SQL.\nSuppose you have Table Sample with 4 column a,b,c,d where a,b,d are int and c column is Varchar(50).So you cant inset multiple records in this table using following query without repeating insert statement,Also With C# using SqlBulkCopy bulkcopy = new SqlBulkCopy(con)You can insert 10 rows at a time Using INSERT INTO ... VALUES syntax like in Daniel Vassallo\'s answer\nthere is one annoying limitation:From MSDNThe maximum number of rows that can be constructed by inserting rows directly in the VALUES list is 1000The easiest way to omit this limitation is to use derived table like:LiveDemo
