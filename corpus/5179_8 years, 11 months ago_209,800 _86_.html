In terms of Java, when someone asks: what is polymorphism?Would overloading or overriding be an acceptable answer?I think there is a bit more to it than that. IF you had a abstract base class that defined a method with no implementation, and you defined that method in the sub class, is that still overridding?I think overloading is not the right answer for sure.The clearest way to express polymorphism is via an abstract base class (or interface)This class is abstract because the goPee() method is not definable for Humans.  It is only definable for the subclasses Male and Female.  Also, Human is an abstract concept â€” You cannot create a human that is neither Male nor Female.  It\xe2\x80\x99s got to be one or the other.So we defer the implementation by using the abstract class.andNow we can tell an entire room full of Humans to go pee.Running this would yield:Polymorphism is the ability of a class instance to behave as if it were an instance of another class in its inheritance tree, most often one of its ancestor classes. For example, in Java all classes inherit from Object. Therefore, you can create a variable of type Object and assign to it an instance of any class.An override is a type of function which occurs in a class which inherits from another class. An override function "replaces" a function inherited from the base class, but does so in such a way that it is called even when an instance of its class is pretending to be a different type through polymorphism. Referring to the previous example, you could define your own class and override the toString() function. Because this function is inherited from Object, it will still be available if you copy an instance of this class into an Object-type variable. Normally, if you call toString() on your class while it is pretending to be an Object, the version of toString which will actually fire is the one defined on Object itself. However, because the function is an override, the definition of toString() from your class is used even when the class instance\'s true type is hidden behind polymorphism.Overloading is the action of defining multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameters. It is unrelated to either overriding or polymorphism.Here\'s an example of polymorphism in pseudo-C#/Java:The Main function doesn\'t know the type of the animal and depends on a particular implementation\'s behavior of the MakeNoise() method.Edit: Looks like Brian beat me to the punch. Funny we used the same example. But the above code should help clarify the concepts.Actually, both are used to achieve polymorphism. You could have a method in a class\nthat is overridden in one or\nmore subclasses. The method does\ndifferent things depending on which\nclass was used to instantiate an object.You could also have a method that it\noverloaded with two or more sets of arguments. The method does\ndifferent things based on the\ntype(s) of argument(s) passed.Polymorphism means more than one form, same object performing different operations according to the requirement.Polymorphism can be achieved by using two ways, those areMethod overloading means writing two or more methods in the same class by using same method name, but the passing parameters is different.Method overriding means we use the method names in the different classes,that means parent class method is used in the child class.In Java to achieve polymorphism a super class reference variable can hold the sub class object.To achieve the polymorphism every developer must use the same method names in the project.You are correct that overloading is not the answer.Neither is overriding.  Overriding is the means by which you get polymorphism.   Polymorphism is the ability for an object to vary behavior based on its type.  This is best demonstrated when the caller of an object that exhibits polymorphism is unaware of what specific type the object is.Specifically saying overloading or overriding doesn\'t give the full picture.  Polymorphism is simply the ability of an object to specialize its behavior based on its type.  I would disagree with some of the answers here in that overloading is a form of polymorphism (parametric polymorphism) in the case that a method with the same name can behave differently give different parameter types.  A good example is operator overloading.  You can define "+" to accept different types of parameters -- say strings or int\'s -- and based on those types, "+" will behave differently.Polymorphism also includes inheritance and overriding methods, though they can be abstract or virtual in the base type.  In terms of inheritance-based polymorphism, Java only supports single class inheritance limiting it polymorphic behavior to that of a single chain of base types.  Java does support implementation of multiple interfaces which is yet another form of polymorphic behavior.The classic example, Dogs and cats are animals, animals have the method makeNoise. I can iterate through an array of animals calling makeNoise on them and expect that they would do there respective implementation.The calling code does not have to know what specific animal they are.Thats what I think of as polymorphism.Neither:Overloading is when you have the same function name that takes different parameters.Overriding is when a child class replaces a parent\'s method with one of its own (this in iteself does not constitute polymorphism).Polymorphism is late binding, e.g. the base class (parent) methods are being called but not until runtime does the application know what the actual object is - it may be a child class whose methods are different.  This is because any child class can be used where a base class is defined.In Java you see polymorphism a lot with the collections library:List is the base class, the compiler has no clue if you\'re counting a linked list, vector, array, or a custom list implementation, as long as it acts like a List:If you were overloading you\'d have:and the correct version of countStuff() would be picked by the compiler to match the parameters.The term overloading refers to having multiple versions of something with the same name, usually methods with different parameter listsSo these functions might do the same thing but you have the option to call it with an ID, or a name.  Has nothing to do with inheritance, abstract classes, etc.Overriding usually refers to polymorphism, as you described in your questionPolymorphism is the ability for an object to appear in multiple forms.  This involves using inheritance and virtual functions to build a family of objects which can be interchanged.  The base class contains the prototypes of the virtual functions, possibly unimplemented or with default implementations as the application dictates, and the various derived classes each implements them differently to affect different behaviors.Polymorphism simply means "Many Forms".It does not REQUIRE inheritance to achieve...as interface implementation, which is not inheritance at all, serves polymorphic needs.  Arguably, interface implementation serves polymorphic needs "Better" than inheritance.For example, would you create a super-class to describe all things that can fly?  I should think not.  You would be be best served to create an interface that describes flight and leave it at that.So, since interfaces describe behavior, and method names describe behavior (to the programmer), it is not too far of a stretch to consider method overloading as a lesser form of polymorphism.Overriding \nwhen we inherit the base class and make derived class then if in derived class there is a method which have the same name as the method(same name,same argument,same return type) define in base class then its called Overriding..Output:Bike is running safely........\nTo understand overriding more clearly visit: http://javabyroopam.blogspot.in/Overloading \nSimply two methods that have the same name but have different argument list is called overloading..output 30,20overloading is when you define 2 methods with the same name but different parametersoverriding is where you change the behavior of the base class via a function with the same name in a subclass.So Polymorphism is related to overriding but not really overloading.However if someone gave me a simple answer of "overriding" for the question "What is polymorphism?" I would ask for further explanation.Polymorphism is more likely as far as it\'s meaning is concerned ... to OVERRIDING in javaIt\'s all about different behavior of the SAME object in different situations(In programming way ... you can call different ARGUMENTS) I think the example below will help you to understand ... Though it\'s not PURE java code ...But if we change the ARGUMENT ... the BEHAVIOR will be changed ...The Person(here the "Object") is same ...overriding is more like hiding an inherited method by declaring a method with the same name and signature as the upper level method (super method), this  adds a polymorphic behaviour to the  class .\nin other words the decision to choose wich level method to be called  will be made at run time not on compile time .\nthis leads to  the concept of interface and implementation .Polymorphism is a multiple implementations of an object or you could say multiple forms of an object. lets say you have class Animals as the abstract base class and it has a method called movement() which defines the way that the animal moves. Now in reality we have different kinds of animals and they move differently as well some of them with 2 legs, others with 4 and some with no legs, etc.. To define different movement() of each animal on earth, we need to apply polymorphism. However, you need to define more classes i.e. class Dogs Cats Fish etc. Then you need to extend those classes from the base class Animals and override its method movement() with a new movement functionality based on each animal you have. You can also use Interfaces to achieve that. The keyword in here is overriding, overloading is different and is not considered as polymorphism. with overloading you can define multiple methods "with same name" but with different parameters on same object or class.what is polymorphism?From java tutorialThe dictionary definition of polymorphism refers to a principle in biology in which an organism or species can have many different forms or stages. This principle can also be applied to object-oriented programming and languages like the Java language. Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class.By considering the examples and definition, overriding should be accepted answer. Regarding your second query:IF you had a abstract base class that defined a method with no implementation, and you defined that method in the sub class, is that still overridding?It should be called overriding. Have a look at this example to understand different types of overriding. code snippet:output:I think guys your are mixing concepts. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to behave differently at run time. For achieving this, you need two requisites:Having said that overloading means something different to overriding depending on the language you are using. For example in Java does not exist overriding but overloading. Overloaded methods with different signature to its base class are available in the subclass. Otherwise they would be overridden (please, see that I mean now the fact of there is no way to call your base class method from outside the object).However in C++ that is not so. Any overloaded method, independently whether the signature is the same or  not (diffrrent amount, different type) is as well overridden. That is to day, the base class\' method is no longer available in the subclass when being called from outside the subclass object, obviously.So the answer is when talking about Java use overloading. In any other language may be different as it happens in c++Polymorphism relates to the ability of a language to have different object treated uniformly by using a single interfaces; as such it is related to overriding, so the interface (or the base class) is polymorphic, the implementor is the object which overrides (two faces of the same medal)anyway, the difference between the two terms is better explained using other languages, such as c++: a polymorphic object in c++ behaves as the java counterpart if the base function is virtual, but if the method is not virtual the code jump is resolved statically, and the true type not checked at runtime so, polymorphism include the ability for an object to behave differently depending on the interface used to access it; let me make an example in pseudocode:(supposing that makeRumor is NOT virtual)java doesn\'t truly offer this level of polymorphism (called also object slicing). animal a = new dog();\n    dog b = new dog();on both case it will only print woff..\nsince a and b is refering to class dog
