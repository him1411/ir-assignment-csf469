ASP.NET MVC can generate HTML elements using HTML Helpers, for example @Html.ActionLink(), @Html.BeginForm() and so on.I know I can specify form attributes by creating an anonymous object and pass that object for the (fourth in this case) htmlAttributes parameter where specifying an id for the element: But what about the class attribute? Obviously this does not work:As that just throws random syntax errors when my view is requested, because it expects something else after encountering the C# keyword class.I\'ve also tried:and But they also did not work, as the underscores get replaced by dashes.I know that I can just as well write the HTML elements by hand or wrap the form inside a <div class="myClass">, but I\'d still be interested to know how it is supposed to be done. In order to create an anonymous type (or any type) with a property that has a reserved keyword as its name in C#, you can prepend the property name with an at sign, @:For VB.NET this syntax would be accomplished using the dot, ., which in that language is default syntax for all anonymous types:Current best practice in CSS development is to create more general selectors with modifiers that can be applied as widely as possible throughout the web site. I would try to avoid defining separate styles for individual page elements.If the purpose of the CSS class on the <form/> element is to control the style of elements within the form, you could add the class attribute the existing <fieldset/> element which encapsulates any form by default in web pages generated by ASP.NET MVC. A CSS class on the form is rarely necessary.
