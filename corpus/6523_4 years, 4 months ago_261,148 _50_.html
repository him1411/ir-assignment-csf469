I have created an AWS EC2 Instance and I want to be able to upload files to the server directory using FileZilla in the simplest and most straightforward fashion possible. I\'ve created video tutorial for this just check. Connect to Amazon EC2 file directory using FileZilla and SFTP, Video TutorialSummary of above video tutorial: File > Site Manager Add a new site with the following parameters: Host: Your public dns name of ec2 instance, or the public ip address of the serverProtocol: SFTP Logon Type: Normal User: From the docs:  "For Amazon Linux, the default user name is ec2-user. For RHEL5, the user name is often root but might be ec2-user. For Ubuntu, the user name is ubuntu. For SUSE Linux, the user name is root. For Debian, the user name is admin. Otherwise, check with your AMI provider."Press Connect Button - If saving of passwords has been disabled, you will be prompted that the logon type will be changed to \'Ask for password\'.  Say \'OK\' and when connecting, at the password prompt push \'OK\' without entering a password to proceed past the dialog.  Note:  FileZilla automatically figures out which key to use.  You do not need to specify the key after importing it as described above.If you use Cyberduck follow this.Check this post if you have any permission issues.If anyone is following all the steps and having no success, make sure that you are using the correct user. I was attempting to use "ec2-user" but I needed to use "ubuntu."Make sure you use port 22. Filezilla will default to port 21 for SFTP.Just one minor note to the well explained accepted answer of \nYasitha Chinthaka:Note: FileZilla automatically figures out which key to use. You do not\n  need to specify the key after importing it as described above.In my case I already had other 5 ppks from other instances that I was using in the past (with the ppk of the new instance being at the bottom of that list). I added the new ppk of my new instance, and it wouldn\'t let me connect to it. The error message: too many tries / attempts.After I deleted the unused ppks, I was finally able to login to the instance.So no, Filezilla is not that smart ;-)You can use any FTP client. I use winscp and it works just fine. In all these clients; you can specify the ssh secure key.Old question but what I\'ve found is that, all you need is to add the ppk file.\nSettings -> Connections -> SFTP -> Add keyfile\nUser name and the host is same as what you would provide when using putty which is mentioned in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-connect-to-instance-linux.html\nMight help someone.In my case, Filezilla sends the AWS ppk file to every other FTP server I try to securely connect to. That\'s crazy. There\'s a workaround as written below but it\'s ugly.It does not behave well as @Lucio M pointed out.From this discussion: https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=30605n0lqu:Agreed. However, given I can\'t control the operation of the server, is there any way to specify within FileZilla that a site should authenticate with a password rather than key, or vice-versa? Or tell it to try password first, then key only if password fails? It appears to me it\'s trying key first, and then not getting a chance to try password.botg(Filezilla admin) replied:There\'s no such option.n0lqu:Could such an option be added, or are there any good workarounds anyone can recommend? Right now, the only workaround I know is to delete the key from general preferences, add it back only when connecting to the specific site that requires it, then deleting it again when done so it doesn\'t mess up other sites.botg:Right now you could have two FileZilla instances with separate config dirs (e. g. one installed and one portable).timboskratch:I just had this same issue today and managed to resolve it by changing the "logon type" of the connection using a password in the site manager. Instead of "Normal" I could select either "Interactive" or "Ask for Password" (not really sure what the difference is) and then when I tried to connect to the site again it gave me a prompt to enter my password and then connected successfully.\n  It\'s not ideal as it means you have to remember and re-type you password every time you connect, but better than having to install 2 instances of FileZilla.\n  I totally agree that it would be very useful in the Site Manager to have full options of how you would like FileZilla to connect to each site which is set up (whether to use a password, key, etc.)\n  Hope this is helpful!\n  TimAlso see: \nhttps://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=34676So, it seems:For multiple FTP sites with keys / passwords, use multiple Filezilla installs,\nOR,\nuse the same ppk key for all servers.I wish there was a way to tell FileZilla which ppk is for which site in Site Mangerthe most simple and straight forward is to create a FTP login. \nHere is a little and easy to understand tutorial site on stackoverflow itself, how to set things up in 2min... \nSetting up FTP on Amazon Cloud ServerFirst of all Filezilla is an FTP/SFTP client/server. We will need to use the client for this purpose.1) Download the client from the URL: https://filezilla-project.org/2) Go to AWS management console and then EC2. Select the instance that you want to access and then copy the DNS or IP address of the instance and then paste it in Filezilla host name.Follow Image: Amazon Instance Access via FileZilla3) Then, enter the username for the instance that you have created, For Amazon-ami it will be ec2-user and for other OS it would be different. Then, enter the password and port which will be 21 or 22.4) Then, it will ask for the key, which is in pem format just select the .pem file and then it will confirm authentication. Click on Yes and then you are Done.Note: In your EC2 Security group allow port number 21 and 22 whichever required for FTP access.https://www.cloudjojo.com/how-to-connect-ec2-machine-with-ftp/Make sure you open port 21 on aws security group.
