When debugging in Visual Studio, sometimes I add a breakpoint but it\'s hollow and VS says "The breakpoint will not currently be hit. The source code is different from the original version." Obviously this prevents me from being able to debug.What on earth does the message mean? What original version? If I\'ve just opened up the solution and not made any changes whatsoever to the code, how can there be an \'original version\'?As it says, the "source code is different from the original version".Right click on the project folder inside the solution explorer and choose to Clean. Build a new version of the project and the breakpoint will work again!If you have unchecked the DLL project in the Debug build configuration, your new code will never be built!Go to Build --> Configuration Manager ... (in VS2010) and check if the project with the code you\'re trying to debug is checked for the current build configuration.For me it was while working on a WebSite project. After cleaning up these temp folders I got the proper compiler errors back:I finally resolved the problem when I discovered that a class file I had intentionally moved into a subfolder, somehow reappeared in the root folder. VS was using that one while I was editing the other.Did you ever do this?Would you like to continue and run the last successful build?If you ticked the box and pressed "Yes" you will get the last successful build running even though your project does not compile. This means that whenever you set a breakpoint, you will get that error.Try changing this value:Go toUncheck Require source files to exactly match the original versionSelect Debug in Solution Configurations, instead of ReleasePay attention to the "Output" window in VS. It will tell you what assemblies are loaded and when. You may see that an older version of your assembly somewhere in the folder is being loaded. For example if you have multiple assemblies and you are currently trying to break in one of the support assemblies, the CLR will handle the assembly resolving, which may load another assembly file than the one you have referenced in the project.Closing Visual Studio and reopening the solution can fix the problem, i.e. it\'s a bug within the IDE itself (I\'m running VS2010).If you have more than one instances of Visual Studio running, you only need to close the instance running the solution with the problem.There is an almost imperceptible setting that fixed this issue for me. \nIf there is a particular source file in which the breakpoint isn\'t hitting, it could be listed in For some reason unknown to me, VS 2013 decided to place a source file there, and subsequently, I couldn\'t hit breakpoint in that file anymore. This may be the culprit for "source code is different from the original version".This happen often also if you are using a file references to binaries (instead of project references to code in your project), and the compiled binary that you are referencing falls out of sync with the corresponding source code on your machine.  This can happen because you downloaded a new version of the binary from source control without the new source code that went with it, or you have a few versions of the binary on your machine and are referencing an old copy, etc.  If this is indeed the problem, it\'s a good reason to use project references as much as it practical.This can happen when the system time changes while debugging or between debug sessions, be it programmatically, manually or by an external program.You can get this message when you are using an activator and the assembly you set the breakpoint into has not been loaded yet.The breakpoint will resolve once the activator loads the assembly (assuming the assembly and debug symbols are up to date). A good place to look at is the modules window in the debugging menu. There you should look for the assembly which your file belongs too. First check that the assembly is loaded. Then, from where is it loaded? Then, is the symbols file loaded. Again, where is the symbols file loaded from? Finally check the versions of both.I encountered this as well. The conditions that caused my issue: I had caused this by opening a previous version (VS prompted to ask if I wanted to point to this instance in IIS debugging, I answered \'Yes\'), then opening the current version (again responding to the IIS prompt with a \'Yes\'), then attempting to debug in the previous version.To solve, I merely closed and re-opened the previous and intended version, once again asserting it as the debugging source.The problem is that your debug info is not in sync with your assembly. The solution is simple:Should do the trick!(the weird thing is, a rebuild without throwing away the .pdb files doesn\'t always work. I can see the modified date being updated, but still somewhere in the chain (VS2013 debugger, IIS, assembly cache) this change is not detected)This happens also when debugging a C++ project which loads a module that has been  implemented with some CRL language (Managed C++, C# etc). In this situation the error message is misleading indeed.The solution is to put Common language runtime (CLR) support configuration property to the startup project and recompile that.If you have more than one projects in your solution, then make sure that the correct project is set as the StartUp Project. To set a particular project as the Startup Project of your solution, Right-click the project, choose Set As StartUp Project.After I set my StartUp Project correctly, desired break-point was reached by the thread.In my case, I was attaching to a running process in VS 2012.  When attaching, you\'re given the option to debug in various modes (native, script, silverlight, managed 2.0, managed 4.0, etc).  By default, the debugger selects the mode automatically.  However Automatic does not always make the correct choice.  If your process contains multiple types of code, be sure the debugger is using the correct one.In my case, I was developing a Windows CE app, that tested against an emulator. The problem was that the executable wasn\'t deployed to the emulator, so the .pdb (in the development environment) was out of sync with the .exe (in the emulator), because the new .exe was never copied to the emulator. I had to delete the .exe in the emulator to force a new deployment. Then it worked.Try disabling and re-setting the breakpoint while running in debug mode instead of doing it before launching debug mode.What worked for me was to change the solution platform from x86 to Any CPU. After changing to Any, I set a stop address, ran the website, opened the page, clicked the button and it stopped. I closed the site, changed back to x86 and performed the same sequence successfully.Under Windows 7, Visual Studio Express 2010, if you have activated the option Use compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3, this error may occur. I unchecked the option and it worked perfect again. Right-click on the shortcut to VS or the executable, select properties and then compatibility.Check to see if you have more than one file with that name in the solution.I had this on a project that I took over from someone else. The breakpoint list was full of line numbers in Controller.cs, some active and some not. I found this question, and tried a few options, but when I double-clicked on the breakpoints, they took me to different projects within the solution. Because the files were called the same, they appear to be the same, but they aren\'t. The answer is of course then to ignore the warning, as they will become active if you get to load that other file.If your debugged process contains multiple appdomains and the assembly is loaded into both, and one of them is loading an old copy (usually something dynamically loaded like a plugin) the breakpoint can appear solid, but the thread that should hit the breakpoint is in the appdomain with the old assembly, and never hits.  You can see what assemblies are loaded and their path in the module window.First I tried from command line;deleting temp files from command line did work.C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Temporary ASP.NET Files>rd /s rootWhen I disable "Enable Just My Code" option in Tools -> Options -> Debugging -> GeneralThe problem resolved for me. It is a WCF application, was trying to debug an ashx page.\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/zainnab/archive/2010/10/25/understanding-just-my-code.aspxIn my case the problem was ASP.NET debugging wasn\'t enabled under project properties>>WebIt happened to me because I had other projects in the solution that weren\'t building.\nAfter I unloaded those problematic projects (right-click on the project in the solution explorer -> Unload Project), rebuilt the solution and ran again -- the breakpoint was hit!I had been messing with my csproj file earlier.  So under project properties (VS 2013) > Web tab > Servers section > [dropdown], I had "IIS Express" selected when I previously had "Local IIS" selected.  Once I corrected the settings to what I had before, the breakpoints worked.There are cases when recompiling and rebuild doesn\'t help to overcome this problem.\nOne of other potential solutions could be deletion of source file with breakpoints from Solution Explorer and adding it again (e.g. by drag and drop from folder).For me; my website was running in an IIS Application under Default Website (http://localhost/myapp/) and the mapping for the IIS application was pointing to a disk path that was different to the source code I was working on. To resolve; remap your IIS Application to the same path as the source code you are building.(This can happen if you have multiple versions of the same application running from different locations on your disk)In my case I forgot to include the "stdafx.h" in the header file where I was declaring a template function.
