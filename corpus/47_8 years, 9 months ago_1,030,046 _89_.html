If Python does not have a ternary conditional operator, is it possible to simulate one using other language constructs?Yes, it was added in version 2.5.\nThe syntax is:First condition is evaluated, then either a or b is returned based on the Boolean value of condition\nIf condition evaluates to True a is returned, else b is returned. For example:Keep in mind that it\'s frowned upon by some Pythonistas for several reasons:If you\'re having trouble remembering the order, then remember that if you read it out loud, you (almost) say what you mean. For example, x = 4 if b > 8 else 9 is read aloud as x will be 4 if b is greater than 8 otherwise 9.Official documentation:You can index into a tuple:test needs to return True or False.\nIt might be safer to always implement it as:or you can use the built-in bool() to assure a Boolean value:For versions prior to 2.5, there\'s the trick:It can give wrong results when on_true \n has a false boolean value.1\nAlthough it does have the benefit of evaluating expressions left to right, which is clearer in my opinion.1. Is there an equivalent of C\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9d?:\xe2\x80\x9d ternary operator?expression1 if condition else expression2From the documentation:Conditional expressions (sometimes called a \xe2\x80\x9cternary operator\xe2\x80\x9d) have the lowest priority of all Python operations.The expression x if C else y first evaluates the condition, C (not x); if C is true, x is evaluated and its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and its value is returned.See PEP 308 for more details about conditional expressions.New since version 2.5.@up:Unfortunately, thesolution doesn\'t have short-circuit behaviour; thus both falseValue and trueValue are evaluated regardless of the condition. This could be suboptimal or even buggy (i.e. both trueValue and falseValue could be methods and have side-effects).One solution to this would be(execution delayed until the winner is known ;)), but it introduces inconsistency between callable and non-callable objects. In addition, it doesn\'t solve the case when using properties.And so the story goes - choosing between 3 mentioned solutions is a trade-off between having the short-circuit feature, using at least python 2.5 (IMHO not a problem anymore) and not being prone to "trueValue-evaluates-to-false" errors.An operator for a conditional expression in Python was added in 2006 as part of Python Enhancement Proposal 308. Its form differ from common ?: operator and it\'s:which is equivalent to:Here is an example:Another syntax which can be used (compatible with versions before 2.5):where operands are lazily evaluated.Another way is by indexing a tuple (which isn\'t consistent with the conditional operator of most other languages):or explicitly constructed dictionary:Another (less reliable), but simpler method is to use and and or operators:however this won\'t work if x would be False.A possible workaround is to make x and y lists or tuples as in the following:or:If you\'re working with dictionaries, instead of using a ternary conditional, you can take advantage of get(key, default), for example:Source: ?: in Python at WikipediaFor Python 2.5 and newer there is a specific syntax:In older Pythons a ternary operator is not implemented but it\'s possible to simulate it.Though, there is a potential problem, which if cond evaluates to True and on_true evaluates to False then on_false is returned instead of on_true. If you want this behavior the method is OK, otherwise use this:which can be wrapped by:and used this way:It is compatible with all Python versions.You might often findbut this lead to problem when on_true == 0where you would expect for a  normal ternary operator this resultHere I just try to show some important difference in ternary operator between a couple of programming languages.Ternary Operator in JavascriptTernary Operator in RubyTernary operator in ScalaTernary operator in R programmingTernary operator in PythonNow you can see the beauty of python language. its highly readable and maintainable.Absolutely, and it is incredibly easy to understand. Yes. From the grammar file:The part of interest is:So, a ternary conditional operation is of the form:expression3 will be lazily evaluated (that is, evaluated only if expression2 is false in a boolean context). And because of the recursive definition, you can chain them indefinitely (though it may considered bad style.)Note that every if must be followed with an else. People learning list comprehensions and generator expressions may find this to be a difficult lesson to learn - the following will not work, as Python expects a third expression for an else:which raises a SyntaxError: invalid syntax.\nSo the above is either an incomplete piece of logic (perhaps the user expects a no-op in the false condition) or what may be intended is to use expression2 as a filter - notes that the following is legal Python:expression2 works as a filter for the list comprehension, and is not a ternary conditional operator.You may find it somewhat painful to write the following:expression1 will have to be evaluated twice with the above usage. It can limit redundancy if it is simply a local variable. However, a common and performant Pythonic idiom for this use-case is to use or\'s shortcutting behavior:which is equivalent in semantics. Note that some style-guides may limit this usage on the grounds of clarity - it does pack a lot of meaning into very little syntax.Simulating the python ternary operator.For exampleoutput:More a tip than an answer (don\'t need to repeat the obvious for the hundreth time), but I sometimes use it as a oneliner shortcut in such constructs:, becomes:Some (many :) may frown upon it as unpythonic (even, ruby-ish :), but I personally find it more natural - i.e. how you\'d express it normally, plus a bit more visually appealing in large blocks of code.Yes, you can use it that way : Read more about ternary conditional operatoryou can do this :-Example:-This would print "odd" if the number is odd or "even" if the number is even.Note :- 0 , None , False , emptylist , emptyString evaluates as False.\nAnd any data other than 0 evaluates to True.if the condition [condition] becomes "True" then , expression_1 will be evaluated but not expression_2 .\nIf we "and" something with 0 (zero) , the result will always to be fasle .So in the below statement ,The expression exp won\'t be evaluated at all since "and" with 0 will always evaluate to zero and there is no need to evaluate the expression . This is how the compiler itself works , in all languages.In the expression exp won\'t be evaluated at all since "or" with 1 will always be 1. So it won\'t bother to evaluate the expression exp since the result will be 1 anyway . (compiler optimization methods). But in case of The second expression exp2 won\'t be evaluated since True and exp1 would be True when exp1 isn\'t false .Similarly in The expression exp1 won\'t be evaluated since False is equivalent to writing 0 and doing "and" with 0 would be 0 itself but after exp1 since "or" is used, it will evaluate the expression exp2 after "or" .Note:- This kind of branching using "or" and "and" can only be used when the expression_1 doesn\'t have a Truth value of False (or 0 or None or emptylist [ ] or emptystring \' \'.) since if expression_1 becomes False , then the expression_2 will be evaluated because of the presence "or" between exp_1 and exp_2.In case you still want to make it work for all the cases regardless of what exp_1 and exp_2 truth values are, do this :-Yes.There is a ternary option as stated in other answers, but you can also simulate it using "or" if you are checking against a boolean or None value:
