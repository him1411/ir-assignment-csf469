Does VBA have dictionary structure? Like key<>value array? Yes.Set a reference to MS Scripting runtime (\'Microsoft Scripting Runtime\')  orExample of use:Don\'t forget to set the dictionary to Nothing when you have finished using it.VBA has the collection object:The Collection object performs key-based lookups using a hash so it\'s quick.You can use a Contains() function to check whether a particular collection contains a key:Edit 24 June 2015: Shorter Contains() thanks to @TWiStErRob.Edit 25 September 2015: Added Err.Clear() thanks to @scipilot.VBA does not have an internal implementation of a dictionary, but from VBA you can still use the dictionary object from MS Scripting Runtime Library.An additional dictionary example that is useful for containing frequency of occurence.Outside of loop:Within a loop:To check on frequency:Building off cjrh\'s answer, we can build a Contains function requiring no labels (I don\'t like using labels).For a project of mine, I wrote a set of helper functions to make a Collection behave more like a Dictionary. It still allows recursive collections. You\'ll notice Key always comes first because it was mandatory and made more sense in my implementation. I also used only String keys. You can change it back if you like.I renamed this to set because it will overwrite old values.The err stuff is for objects since you would pass objects using set and variables without. I think you can just check if it\'s an object, but I was pressed for time.The reason for this post...Doesn\'t throw if it doesn\'t exist. Just makes sure it\'s removed.Get an array of keys.The scripting runtime dictionary seems to have a bug that can ruin your design at advanced stages.If the dictionary value is an array, you cannot update values of elements contained in the array through a reference to the dictionary.Yes.  For VB6, VBA (Excel), and VB.NETIf by any reason, you can\'t install additional features to your Excel or don\'t want to, you can use arrays as well, at least for simple problems.\nAs WhatIsCapital you put name of the country and the function returns you its capital.All the others have already mentioned the use of the scripting.runtime version of the Dictionary class. If you are unable to use this DLL you can also use this version, simply add it to your code.https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Dictionary/blob/master/Dictionary.clsIt is identical to Microsoft\'s version.
