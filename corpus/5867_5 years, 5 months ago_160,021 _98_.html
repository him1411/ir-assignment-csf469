When I run bundle install for my Rails 3 project on Centos 5.5 it fails with an error:When I try to install the gem manually (by gem install multi_json -v \'1.3.2\') it works. The same problem occurs with several other gems. I use RVM (1.12.3), ruby 1.9.2, bundler 1.1.3. How to fix it?UpdateNow that I\'ve karma wh..err mined enough from this answer everyone should know that this should have been fixed.re: via Ownatik again bundle install fails with SSL certificate verification errorMy answer is still correct and left below for reference if that ends up not working for you.Honestly the best temporary solution is to [...] use the non-ssl version of rubygems in your gemfile as a temporary workaround.via user Ownatikwhat they mean is at the top of the Gemfile in your rails application directory changesource \'https://rubygems.org\'tosource \'http://rubygems.org\'note that the second version is http instead of httpsReplace the ssl gem source with non-ssl as a temp solution:The reason is old rubygems. You need to update system part using non ssl source first:gem update --system --source http://rubygems.org/ (temporarily updating system part using non-ssl connection).Now you\'re ready to use gem update.If you\'re on a mac and use a recent version of RVM (~1.20), the following command worked for me.This issue should now be fixed. Update rubygems (gem update --system), make sure openssl is at the latest version on your OS, or try these tips of it\'s still not working: http://railsapps.github.com/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.htmlTemporary solution (as alluded to by Ownatik):Create or modify a file called .gemrc in your home path, including the line :ssl_verify_mode: 0This will prevent bundler from checking the SSL certificates of gems when it attempts to install them.For *nix devices, \'home path\' means ~/.gemrc. You can also create /etc/gemrc if you prefer. For Windows XP, \'home path\' means c:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\gemrc. For Windows 7, C:\\ProgramData\\gemrcOn windows7 you can download the cacert.pem file from here and set the environementvariable SSL_CERT_FILE to the path where you store the certificate eg or you can set the variable in your script like this ENV[\'SSL_CERT_FILE\']="C:/users/<username>/cacert.pem"Replace <username> with you own username.The real solution to this problem, if you are using RVM:Hat tip to this tip on the RailsApps project!For those of you that have ruby installed through RVM and want a quick fix (preferring not to read per Bruno\'s request) just try this:For a more details, here is the link where I found the solution. http://railsapps.github.com/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html BTW, I didn\'t have to touch my certificates on Ubuntu.Best of all, this isn\'t a workaround. It will download gems through\n  SSL and fail if there if there is a problem like a man in the middle\n  attack which is much better than just turning off security.This has been fixedhttp://guides.rubygems.org/ssl-certificate-update/Now that RubyGems 2.6.x has been released, you can manually update to this version.Download https://rubygems.org/downloads/rubygems-update-2.6.7.gemPlease download the file in a directory that you can later point to (eg. the root of your harddrive C:)Now, using your Command Prompt:After this, gem --version should report the new update version.You can now safely uninstall rubygems-update gem:You can download a list of CA certificates from curl\'s website at http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pemThen set the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable to tell Ruby to use it. For example, in Linux:(Reference: https://gist.github.com/fnichol/867550)Simple copy paste instruction given here about .pem filehttps://gist.github.com/luislavena/f064211759ee0f806c88For  certificate verification failedIf you\'ve read the previous sections, you will know what this means (and shame > on you if you have not).We need to download AddTrustExternalCARoot-2048.pem.\n  Open a Command Prompt and type in:C:>gem which rubygems\n  C:/Ruby21/lib/ruby/2.1.0/rubygems.rb\n  Now, let\'s locate that directory. From within the same window, enter the path part up to the file extension, but using backslashes instead:C:>start C:\\Ruby21\\lib\\ruby\\2.1.0\\rubygems\n  This will open a Explorer window inside the directory we indicated.Step 3: Copy new trust certificateNow, locate ssl_certs directory and copy the .pem file we obtained from previous step inside.It will be listed with other files like GeoTrustGlobalCA.pem.same problem but with different gem here:temporarily solution: gem install builder -v \'3.0.0\' makes it possible to continue bundle installThis is How you fix this problem on Windows:download .perm file then set the SSL_CERT_FILE in command prompthttps://gist.github.com/fnichol/867550I get a slightly different error, though perhaps related, on Ubuntu 12.04:It happens when I run bundle install with source \'https://rubygems.org\' in a Gemfile.This is an issue with OpenSSL on Ubuntu 12.04. See Rubygems issue #319.To fix this, run apt-get update && apt-get upgrade on Ubuntu 12.04 to upgrade your OpenSSL.The simplest solution:Voila!I was able to track this down to the fact that the binaries that rvm downloads do not play nice with OS X\'s OpenSSL, which is old and is no longer used by the OS. The solution for me was to force compilation when installing Ruby via rvm:My permanent fix for Windows: Download the CACert , save as C:\\ruby\\ssl_certs\\GlobalSignRootCA.pem from http://guides.rubygems.org/ssl-certificate-update/Create system variable named "SSL_CERT_FILE", set to C:\\ruby\\ssl_certs\\GlobalSignRootCA.pem.Try again: gem install bundler:Thx to @Alexander.Iljushkin for:gem update --system --source http://rubygems.org/After that bundler still failed and the solution to that was:gem install bundlerI was getting a similar error. Here is how I solved this: In your path directory, check for Gemfile. Edit the source in the gemfile to http instead of https and save it. This might install the bundler without the SSL certificate issue.lFor Windows machine, check your gem version withThen update your gem as follow:Please download the file in a directory that you can later point to (eg. the root of your hard drive C:)Now, using your Command Prompt:Now, bundle install will success without SSL certificate verification error.More detailed instruction is hereThis worked for me:I had to reinstall openssl:I was just recently faced with this issue and followed the steps outlined here. There might be a chance that you are not pointing to the right OpenSSL certificate. After running:and the bundle complete ran!Download  rubygems-update-2.6.7.gem .Now, using your Command Prompt:After this, gem --version should report the new update version.You can now safely uninstall rubygems-update gem:To note, if you\'re grabbing gems from a source which SSL cert is trusted by an internal certificate authority (or you are connecting to an external source through a company web proxy with SSL inspection), point your SSL_CERT_FILE env variable to your certificate chain.  This most likely just requires exporting your root certificate from your certificate store (System Keychain on macOS) to an accessible location from your shell i.e.:If you were using https://rails-assets.org/ to manage your assets, no answers will help you. Even converting to http won\'t help.The simplest fix is using this source instead,  http://insecure.rails-assets.org. This has been mentioned in their homepage.The only thing that worked for me on legacy windows system and ruby 1.9 version is downloading cacert file from\nhttp://guides.rubygems.org/ssl-certificate-update/And then running below command before running bundle install
