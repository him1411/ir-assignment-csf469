I developed an application to display some text at defined intervals in the Android emulator screen. I am using the Handler class. Here is a snippet from my code:When I run this application the text is displayed only once. Why?The simple fix to your example is :Or we can use normal thread for example (with original Runner) :You may consider your runnable object just as a command that can be sent to the message queue for execution, and handler as just a helper object used to send that command.More details are here http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.htmlI think can improve first solution of Alex2k8 for update correct each second1.Original code:2.Analysis3. SolutionTo avoid that Just change order of postDelayed(), to avoid delayed:I believe for this typical case, i.e. to run something with a fixed interval, Timer is more appropriate. Here is a simple example:Using Timer has few advantages:For repeating task you can usecall it like The above code will run first time after half second(500) and repeat itself after each second(1000)Where task being the method to be executedafter the time to initial execution   (interval the time for repeating the execution)SecondlyAnd you can also use CountDownTimer if you want to execute a Task number of times.And you can also do it with runnable. create a runnable method like And call it in both these waysORIf I understand correctly the documentation of Handler.post() method:Causes the Runnable r to be added to the message queue. The runnable will be run on the thread to which this handler is attached.So examples provided by @alex2k8, even though are working correctly, are not the same.\nIn case, where Handler.post() is used, no new threads are created. You just post Runnable to the thread with Handler to be executed by EDT.\nAfter that, EDT only executes Runnable.run(), nothing else.Remember:\nRunnable != Thread.An interesting example is you can continuously see a counter/stop-watch running in separate thread. Also showing GPS-Location. While main activity User Interface Thread is already there.Excerpt:To look at code see here:Thread example displaying GPS Location and Current Time runnable alongside main-activity\'s User Interface Thread
