You must set that off before importing your file and then check how import works like a gem.You just need to do the following thing:We can use this command to import SQL from command line:For example, if the username is root and password is password. And you have a database name as bank and the SQL file is bank.sql. Then, simply do like this:Remember where your SQL file is. If your SQL file is in the Desktop folder/directory then go the desktop directory and enter the command like this:And if your are in the Project directory and your SQL file is in the Desktop directory. If you want to access it from the Project directory then you can do like this:Among all the answers, for the problem above, this is the best one:Solution that worked for me is below:Go to the directory where you have the MySQL executable. -u for username and -p to prompt for the password:To import a single database, use the following commands.For multiple database dumps, use the following commands.To dump a database into a SQL file use the following commandTo import a SQL file into a database (make sure you are in the same directory as the SQL file or supply the full path to the file)You do not need to specify the name of the database on the command line if the .sql file contains CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name and USE db_name statements.Just make sure you are connecting with a user that has the permissions to create the database, if the database mentioned in the .sql file does not exist.For importing multiple SQL files at one time, use this:For simple importing:For WAMP:for XamppI think it\'s worth mentioning that you can also load a gzipped (compressed) file with zcat like shown below:Add the --force option:I thought it could be useful for those who are using Mac OS X:Replace xampp with mamp or other web servers.The following command works for me from the command line (cmd) on \nWindows 7 on WAMP.Go to drive:MySQL loginIt will ask for pwd. Enter it:Select the databaseProvide the file nameGo to the directory where you have MySQL.Also to dump all databases, use the -all-databases option, and no databases\xe2\x80\x99 name needs to be specified anymore.Or you can use some GUI clients like SQLyog to do this.For backup purposes, make a BAT file and run this BAT file using Task Scheduler. It will take a backup of the database; just copy the following line and paste in Notepad and then save the .bat file, and run it on your system.For information I just had default root + withoutpassword, it didn\'t works with all above answers.

Example: cd /var/www/htmlStep 3: mysql -u username -p database-name < file.sql \n         Enter the password and wait till uploading is completed.Providing credentials on the command line is not a good idea. The above answers are great, but neglect to mentionWhere etc/myhost.cnf is a file that contains host, user, password, and you avoid exposing the password on the command line. Here is a sample,Similarly to https://stackoverflow.com/a/17666285/1888983\nKey differences for me:Running fedora 26 with MariaDB.If you are using MAMP on Mac OS X, this may be helpful:MYSQL_USER is root by default.Export particular databases:This will export CCR and KIT databases...Import all exported databases to a particular MySQL instance (you have to be where your dump file is):
