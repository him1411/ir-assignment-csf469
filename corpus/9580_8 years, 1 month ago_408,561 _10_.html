I need to create an array of object literals like this:In a loop like this:The value of key should be results[i].label in each element of the array.RaYell\'s answer is good - it answers your question.It seems to me though that you should really be creating an object keyed by labels with sub-objects as values:The above approach should be much faster and idiomatic than searching the entire object array for a key for each access.In the same idea of Nick Riggs but I create a constructor, and a push a new object in the array by using it. It avoid the repetition of the keys of the class:This will work:This is what Array#map are good atI\'d create the array and then append the object literals to it.
