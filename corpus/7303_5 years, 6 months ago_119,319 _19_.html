I have installed xcode 4.3.1 on my machine running Lion. I can\'t find the Network Link Conditioner tool anywhere.I have checked the utilities folder, also the xcode/contents/developer/* directories.. no such luck.Do I need to install specific components or has this tool been removed or renamed recently?It\'s in an additional download. Use this menu item:Xcode > Open Developer Tool > More Developer Tools...and get "Hardware IO Tools for Xcode".For Xcode 8, get "Additional Tools for Xcode 8".Double-click on a .prefPane file to install. If you already have an older .prefPane installed, you\'ll need to remove it from /Library/PreferencePanes.You can also install any of the Hardware IO Tools without installing XCode itself. Simply visit Apple\'s Download Center and search for "Hardware IO".The tools can now be found ("Hardware IO tools") here: https://developer.apple.com/download/more/For Xcode 8 you gotta download a package named Additional Tools for Xcode 8For other versions (8.1, 8.2) get the package hereDouble click and open the dmg and go to Hardware directory. Double click on Network Link Conditioner.prefPane.Click on installNow Network Link Conditioner will be available in System Preferences.For versions older than Xcode 8, the package to be downloaded is called Hardware IO Tools for Xcode. Get it from this page
