I am having some problems when trying to install mysql2 gem for Rails. When I try to install it by running bundle install or gem install mysql2 it gives me the following error:Error installing mysql2: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.How can I fix this and successfully install mysql2?On Ubuntu/Debian and other distributions using aptitude:Package libmysql-ruby has been phased out and replaced by ruby-mysql. This is where I found the solution.If the above command doesn\'t work because libmysql-ruby cannot be found, the following should be sufficient:On Red Hat/CentOS and other distributions using yum:On Mac OS X with Homebrew:I\'m on a mac and use homebrew to install open source programs. I did have to install mac Dev tools in order to install homebrew, but after that it was a simple:to install mysql.

Solved by installing development packages. I\'m using arch and it was:which installed:but I think it actually needed make and gcc. Error output said (on my machine, among other):"You have to install development tools first."So it was an obvious decision and it helped.This solved my problem once in Windows:I was running into this error on my mac and found that I needed to upgrade from mysql 32bit to mysql 64 bit to get this error to go away.  I was running OSX 10.6 on an intel macbook pro with ruby 1.9.2 and rails3.0.0 I also needed to install xcode in order to get unix utilities like "make" that are required to compile the gem.once this was done I was able to run gem install mysql and gem install mysql2 without error.You have to Install some dependenciesFor windows user:\nYou set the lib and include path of your mysql, for instance, if youre using xampp you can have like this:Solution only works on Mac OS XIf you\'ve installed MySQL with homebrew, what worked for me was uninstalling MySQL, and installing MySQL Community Edition via the MySQL website (https://www.mysql.com/). After installed, just re-enter the command to gem install mysql2 or if necessary, sudo gem install mysql2, if you are getting permission denied problems. I got the gem built on Mac OS X 10.6.6 by\n1) Ensuring the Developer tools package is installed\n2) Downloading the current MySQL package (5.5.8 in my case) from Source\n3) Installing the cmake tool from cmake.org\n4) Following the instructions in section 2.11 of INSTALL-SOURCE from the mysql distribution files\n5) sudo gem install mysql2 -- --srcdir=/usr/local/mysql/include\nThe gem built successfully, but there are two errors in the documentation that rdoc and ri complain about.\nBut now when I try to require \'mysql2\' I get a I was hoping the error I would get was that the libmysqlclient.16.dylib couldn\'t be found because we figured that out in another post (search for install_name_tool).My $PATH has /usr/local/mysql in it (that\'s where my source and built files are located), so I\'m a little stumped.  If anyone has any thoughts, I\'ll check back after a few hours of sleep.If still getting error then follow the steps of mysql2 gem installation on Rails 3 on - http://rorguide.blogspot.com/2011/03/installing-mysql2-gem-on-ruby-192-and.htmlwhere most of the user were able to install mysql2 gem.After you get the mysql-dev issues corrected, you may need to remove the bad mysql2 install. Look carefully at the messages after $ bundle install. You may need to This will clear out the bad mysql2 installation so that a final $ bundle install can create a good one.download the right version of mysqllib.dll then copy it to ruby bin really works for me. Follow this link plases mysql2 gem compiled for wrong mysql client libraryGot the "You have to install development tools first." error when trying to install the mysql2 gem after upgrading to Mac OS X Mountain Lion.  Apparently doing this upgrade removes the command line compilers.To fix:You are getting this problem because you have not install MySql. Before install mysql2 gem. Install MySQL. After that mysql2 gem will install. I just wanted to add this answer specifically for Mac Users.My server was running perfectly fine until I updated my xcode. The while starting my rails server the error was shown like thisAnd there was suggestion to install mysql2 gem at the end of the error message. So when i tried installing it I got the error as above mentioned in this question. The error I got is as follows So as suggested in this post I tried \'brew install mysql\' and that quitted saying that mysql version so and so already installed. But there was warning before it sayingThen I tried this sudo xcodebuild -license and type \'agree\' at the end. You have to be root to agree to the license.After this, I again tried bundle install and then everything is working fine as normal. [ Even due to this xcode updation, I had problem with my tower also.]For those using Windows 7 and 64-bit MySQLIf you want to use 64-bit MySQL, you should follow the instructions here (also here).There is also a custom built 64-bit connector that works without hassle.
