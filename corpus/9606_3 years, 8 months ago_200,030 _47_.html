What is the preferred method for returning null values in JSON? Is there a different preference for primitives?For example, if my object on the server has an Integer called "myCount" with no value, the most correct JSON for that value would be:oror Same question for Strings - if I have a null string "myString" on the server, is the best JSON:or or or (lord help me)I like the convention for collections to be represented in the JSON as an empty collection http://jtechies.blogspot.nl/2012/07/item-43-return-empty-arrays-or.htmlAn empty Array would be represented:EDIT SummaryThe \'personal preference\' argument seems realistic, but short sited in that, as a community will be consuming greater numbers of disparate services/sources. Conventions for JSON structure would help normalize consumption and reuse of said services. As far as establishing a standard, I would suggest adopting most of the Jackson conventions with a few exceptions:If you are returning a JSON object with mostly null values, you may have a candidate for refactoring into multiple services.The above JSON was generated from the following Java class.Maven dependency:Let\'s evaluate the parsing of each:http://jsfiddle.net/brandonscript/Y2dGv/JSON2 is way the JSON spec indicates null should be represented. But as always, it depends on what you\'re doing -- sometimes the "right" way to do it doesn\'t always work for your situation. Use your judgement and make an informed decision.JSON1 {}This returns an empty object. There is no data there, and it\'s only going to tell you that whatever key you\'re looking for (be it myCount or something else) is of type undefined.JSON2 {"myCount": null}In this case, myCount is actually defined, albeit its value is null. This is not the same as both "not undefined and not null", and if you were testing for one condition or the other, this might succeed whereas JSON1 would fail.This is the definitive way to represent null per the JSON spec.JSON3 {"myCount": 0}In this case, myCount is 0. That\'s not the same as null, and it\'s not the same as false. If your conditional statement evaluates myCount > 0, then this might be worthwhile to have. Moreover, if you\'re running calculations based on the value here, 0 could be useful. If you\'re trying to test for null however, this is actually not going to work at all.JSON4 {"myString": ""}In this case, you\'re getting an empty string. Again, as with JSON2, it\'s defined, but it\'s empty. You could test for if (obj.myString == "") but you could not test for null or undefined.JSON5 {"myString": "null"}This is probably going to get you in trouble, because you\'re setting the string value to null; in this case, obj.myString == "null" however it is not == null.JSON6 {"myArray": []}This will tell you that your array myArray exists, but it\'s empty. This is useful if you\'re trying to perform a count or evaluation on myArray. For instance, say you wanted to evaluate the number of photos a user posted - you could do myArray.length and it would return 0: defined, but no photos posted.null is not zero. It is not a value, per se: it is a value outside the domain of the variable indicating missing or unknown data.There is only one way to represent null in JSON. Per the specs (RFC 4627 and json.org):I would use null to show that there is no value for that particular key.  For example, use null to represent that "number of devices in your household connects to internet" is unknown.On the other hand, use {} if that particular key is not applicable.  For example, you should not show a count, even if null, to the question "number of cars that has active internet connection" is asked to someone who does not own any cars.I would avoid defaulting any value unless that default makes sense.  Certainly never use "null" to represent no value.There is only one way to represent null; that is with null.That is to say; if any of the clients that consume your JSON representation use the === operator; it could be a problem for them.If you want to convey that you have an object whose attribute myCount has no value:What if you to convey that you have an object with no attributes:Client code will try to access myCount and get undefined; it\'s not there.What if you to convey that you have an object with an attribute myCount that is an empty list:I would pick "default" for data type of variable (null for strings/objects, 0 for numbers), but indeed check what code that will consume the object expects. Don\'t forget there there is sometimes distinction between null/default vs. "not present".Check out null object pattern - sometimes it is better to pass some special object instead of null (i.e. [] array instead of null for arrays or "" for strings).This is a personal and situational choice. The important thing to remember is that the empty string and the number zero are conceptually distinct from null. In the case of a count you probably always want some valid number (unless the count is unknown or undefined), but in the case of strings, who knows? The empty string could mean something in your application. Or maybe it doesn\'t. That\'s up to you to decide.
