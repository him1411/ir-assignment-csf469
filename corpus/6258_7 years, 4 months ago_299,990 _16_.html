This question already has an answer here:I\'m trying to check if a string starts with http. How can I do this check?If you\'re trying to make sure it\'s not another protocol. I\'d use http:// instead, since https would also match, and other things such as http-protocol.com.And in general:Use strpos():Remember the three equals signs (===). It will not work properly if you only use two. This is because strpos() will return false if the needle cannot be found in the haystack.There is also the strncmp() function and strncasecmp() function which is perfect for this situation:In general:The advantage over the substr() approach is that strncmp() just does what needs to be done, without creating a temporary string.You can use a simple regex (updated version from user viriathus as eregi is deprecated)or if you want a case insensitive searchRegexes allow to perform more complex tasksPerformance wise, you don\'t need to create a new string (unlike with substr) nor parse the whole string if it doesn\'t start with what you want. You will have a performance penalty though the 1st time you use the regex (you need to create/compile it).This extension maintains a global per-thread cache of compiled regular\n  expressions (up to 4096).\n  http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.pcre.phpYou can check if your string starts with http using the substr function an example is below.Also work:
