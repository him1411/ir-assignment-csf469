I am trying to center my tabs content vertically but when I add the css style display:inline-flex, horizontal text-align disappears.How can I make both text alignments x and y for each of my tabs?Example Here / Full Screen ExampleIn supported browsers (most of them), you can use top: 50%/left: 50% in combination with  translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%) to dynamically vertically/horizontally center the element.Example Here / Full Screen ExampleIn supported browsers, set the display of the targeted element to flex and use align-items: center for vertical centering and justify-content: center for horizontal centering. Just don\'t forget to add vendor prefixes for additional browser support (see example).Example Here / Full Screen ExampleIn some cases, you will need to ensure that the html/body element\'s height is set to 100%.For vertical alignment, set the parent element\'s width/height to 100% and add display: table. Then for the child element, change the display to table-cell and add vertical-align: middle.For horizontal centering, you could either add text-align: center to center the text and any other inline children elements. Alternatively, you could use margin: 0 auto, assuming the element is block level.Example Here / Full Screen ExampleThis approach assumes that the text has a known height - in this instance, 18px. Just absolutely position the element 50% from the top, relative to the parent element. Use a negative margin-top value that is half of the element\'s known height, in this case - -9px.Example HereIn some cases, the parent element will have a fixed height. For vertical centering, all you have to do is set a line-height value on the child element equal to the fixed height of the parent element.Though this solution will work in some cases, it\'s worth noting that it won\'t work when there are multiple lines of text - like this.If CSS3 is an option (or you have a fallback) you can use transform:Unlike the first approach above, you don\'t want to use left:50% with the negative translation because there\'s an overflow bug in IE9+. Utilize a positive right value and you won\'t see horizontal scrollbars.The best way to center a box both vertically and horizontally, is to use two containers :See also this Fiddle!To center your content in the middle of your page, add the following to your outher container :Here\'s a demo for that :See also this Fiddle!The simplest and cleanest solution for me is using the CSS3 property "transform":Another approach is to use table:First child will be aligned vertically and horizontally at centerto center the Div in a page check the fiddle linkUpdate\nAnother option is to use flex box  check the fiddle linkBelow is the Flex-box approach to get desired resultRun this code snippet and see a vertically and horizontally aligned div.Just make top,bottom, left and right to 0.
