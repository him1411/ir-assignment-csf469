For debugging reasons I want to list all extras (and their values) of an Intent. Now, getting the keys isn\'t a problembut getting the values of the keys is one for me, because some values are strings, some are boolean... How could I get the values in a loop (looping through the keys) and write the values to a logfile? Thanks for any hint!Here\'s what I used to get information on an undocumented (3rd-party) intent:(Make sure to check if bundle is null before the loop)This is how I define utility method to dump all extras of an Intent.The get(String key) method of Bundle returns an Object.  Your best bet is to spin over the key set calling get(String) on each key and using toString() on the Object to output them.  This will work best for primitives, but you may run into issues with Objects that do not implement a toString().  You can do it in one line of code:It outputs something like:"#Intent;action=android.intent.action.MAIN;category=android.intent.category.LAUNCHER;launchFlags=0x10a00000;component=com.mydomain.myapp/.StartActivity;sourceBounds=12%20870%20276%201167; l.profile=0; end"At the end of this string (the part that I bolded) you can find the list of extras (only one extra in this example).This is according to the toUri documentation:\n"The URI contains the Intent\'s data as the base URI, with an additional fragment describing the action, categories, type, flags, package, component, and extras."You could use for (String key : keys) { Object o = get(key); to return an Object, call getClass().getName() on it to get the type, and then do a set of if name.equals("String") type things to work out which method you should actually be calling, in order to get the value?I wanted a way to output the contents of an intent to the log, and to be able to read it easily, so here\'s what I came up with. I\'ve created a LogUtil class, and then took the dumpIntent() method @Pratik created, and modified it a bit. Here\'s what it all looks like:Hope this helps someone!Sorry if this is too verbose or too late, but this was the only way I could find to get the job done. The most complicating factor was the fact that java does not have pass by reference functions, so the get---Extra methods need a default to return and cannot modify a boolean value to tell whether or not the default value is being returned by chance, or because the results were not favorable. For this purpose, it would have been nicer to have the method raise an exception than to have it return a default.I found my information here: Android Intent Documentation. Set DocumentationI noticed in the Android source that almost every operation forces the Bundle to unparcel its data. So if (like me) you need to do this frequently for debugging purposes, the below is very quick to type:If for debugging all you want is a string (sort of implied by the OP but not explicitly stated), simply use toString on the extras Bundle:It returns a string such as:Documentation: Bundle.toString() (it\'s unfortunately the default Object.toString() javadoc and as such quite useless here.)
