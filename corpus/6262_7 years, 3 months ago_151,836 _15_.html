This question already has an answer here:I want a bash command that I can pipe into that will sum a column of numbers. I just want a quick one liner that will do something essentially like this:Edit:\nWith some paste implementations you need to be more explicit when reading from stdin:<cmd> | paste -sd+ - | bcI like the chosen answer. However, it tends to be slower than awk since 2 tools are needed to do the job. Does two lines count?You can then use it without the superfluous \'cat\':FWIW: on MacOS X, you can do it with a one-liner:[a followup to ghostdog74s comments]The following command will add all the lines(first field of the awk output)You can use bc (calculator). Assuming your file with #s is called "n":The tr changes all newlines to "+"; then we append 0 after the last plus, then we pipe the expression (1+2+3+0) to the calculatorOr, if you are OK with using awk or perl, here\'s a Perl one-liner:Use a for loop to iterate over your file \xe2\x80\xa6If you have ruby installed
