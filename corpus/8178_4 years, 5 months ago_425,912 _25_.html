I\'m quite new to C#. I\'m converting something from VB into C#. Having a problem with the syntax of this statement:I then see the following errors:Argument 1: cannot convert from \'object\' to \'byte[]\'The best overloaded method match for\n  \'System.Text.Encoding.GetString(byte[])\' has some invalid argumentsI tried to fix the code based on this post, but still no successAny suggestions?If you already have a byte array then you will need to know what type of encoding was used to make it into that byte array.For example, if the byte array was created like this:You will need to turn it back into a string like this:If you can find in the code you inherited, the encoding used to create the byte array then you should be set.First of all, add the System.Text namespaceThen use this codeHope to fix it!use this Also you can use an extension method to add a method to the string type as below:And use it like below:The following approach will work only if the chars are 1 byte. (Default unicode will not work since it is 2 bytes)Keeping it simpleA refinement to JustinStolle\'s edit (Eran Yogev\'s use of BlockCopy).The proposed solution is indeed faster than using Encoding.\nProblem is that it doesn\'t work for encoding byte arrays of uneven length.\nAs given, it raises an out-of-bound exception.\nIncreasing the length by 1 leaves a trailing byte when decoding from string.For me, the need came when I wanted to encode from DataTable to JSON.\nI was looking for a way to encode binary fields into strings and decode from string back to byte[].I therefore created two classes - one that wraps the above solution (when encoding from strings it\'s fine, because the lengths are always even), and another that handles byte[] encoding.I solved the uneven length problem by adding a single character that tells me if the original length of the binary array was odd (\'1\') or even (\'0\')As follows:Does anyone see any reason why not to do this?
