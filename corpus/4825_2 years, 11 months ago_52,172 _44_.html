After I execute a pod install at the base of my project, I get the following error:CocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project because because your project already has a custom config set. In order for CocoaPods integration to work at all, please either set the base configurations of the target BluePlaquesLondonFramework to Pods/Target Support Files/Pods/Pods.debug.xcconfig or include the Pods/Target Support Files/Pods/Pods.debug.xcconfig in your build configuration.This probably sounds like a silly question, but how do I set the base configuration for a target?https://github.com/seanoshea/BluePlaquesLondon/blob/ios8/Podfile is the Podfile which is causing this issue.http://github.com/seanoshea/BluePlaquesLondon on the iOS 8 branch is the Podfile in question if you\'re curious to see what the project looks like.I had the same problem, but in Xcode 6.1.1 - what fixed it for me was to change the configuration file setting to None for the two Pods-related targets, then run pod install again.The configuration file setting is found by selecting the project (not the target) and then the Info tab.Go into XCode and open your project settings and under the Info tab, you will see "Configurations" where you can set a configuration file for both Debug and Release. You apparently have already set these to some custom config and CocoaPods wants/needs you to use the Pods config.Step-by-stepOnce you have allowed pod install in step 7 to do it\'s magic, you may be able to use a custom config and change your configurations.Ran into the same problem. It would build on the simulator but not on my device. None of the answers solved this for me. Here\'s what I did piecing some answers together:Changed my pods file to use a specific target:Ran pod installYou should also make sure that you have no pods in the root of Podfile, you should define all the pods that are used in many targets like that:You also might need to delete libPods.a and libPods-app.a from the target dependencies, perform a clean and then run pod install again.The line in the podfile that is generating a problem is : link_with [\'BluePlaquesLondon\', \'BluePlaquesLondonFramework\'].Just make  this : link_with [\'BluePlaquesLondon\'] or this (worked in my case, hope it will in yours :-)) :I just ran into this issue after adding some custom build configurations. I could see under:that it had actually created the new xcconfig files that matched the new build configurations but for some reason I could not select these in the project target of my app.What fixed it for me was to install and use cocoapods-deintegrate:and then run:followed by:If you added a custom build configuration to your existing project, Cocoapods will complain about it.Cocoapods will automatically create xcconfig files under the directory Pods/Target Support Files/<build_target> following the naming pattern Pods-<build_target>.<build_config>.xcconfig.Just make sure to manually add those files to your project in Xcode (under the Pods directory, but not inside the Pods project!).  Once those files are included select your project in Xcode, go to the "Info" tab, and expand your custom configuration.  Select the appropriate xcconfig file for each target under your custom configuration.I had the same error while pod install. I tried everything (reinstall pod, update all gems, etc.) and I found solution worked in my case. There was problem because of changing target\'s name. In this case solution is simple:After all everything should works. I moved pods in Podfile outside from the target. File changes from this:To this:In case you are using custom config you can follow the suggestion in the warning and include the Pod config in your config fileThis will NOT stop the warnings but will allow you to use your private config (there is an open bug on the warning with CocoaPods project)\nhttps://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2633I was able to build the project touched by this issue on XCode 6 by: Hope this will help someone.This happened to me because I already had a Pod configuration. I\'m new on iOS development, was searching instructions to install Alamofire + SwiftyJSON and ended up installing the libraries more than once, inadvertently. To me, what worked was: on the folder "Target Support Files" in "Pods" project, I selected the two correct .xcconfig files and dragged them to the "Pods" folder of my app project. This enabled the selection of the correct config files on the base configuration.But then, if I run "pod install" again, the warning will change to the previous .xcconfig file. I try to delete the files and the old framework from the main project but when i ran the previous command once more, gave me the same warning, and created the file "Pods.framework" under the "Pods" folder of my app project. I ignored it, and it seems to be running ok, despite the two frameworks. I don\'t know if it\'s right, and a solution, if exists, it would be welcomed. So for me, the problem was due to the aforementioned xcconfig files names being changed before the Swift 3 update took place. Something was out of sync, so Cocoapods created a \'Recovered References\' folder section with the old named files, and linked to them.To fix this, I:Quit XcodeRun pod installEverything was handled for me after then, and the warnings were gone.The simplest solution for this (after having this issue multiple times):This would recreate everything and works always in minutes (not spending time to reverse engineer the "bug").
