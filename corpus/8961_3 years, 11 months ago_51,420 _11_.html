Two options in setup.py develop and install are confusing me. According to this site, using develop creates a special link to site-packages directory.People have suggested that I use python setup.py install for a fresh installation and python setup.py develop after any changes have been made to the setup file.Can anyone shed some light on the usage of these commands?python setup.py install is used to install (typically third party) packages that you\'re not going to be developing/editing/debugging yourself.For your own stuff, you want to get your package installed and then be able to frequently edit your code and not have to re-install your package\xe2\x80\x94this is exactly what python setup.py develop does: installs the package (typically just a source folder) in a way that allows you to conveniently edit your code after its installed to the (virtual) environment and have the changes take effect immediately.Note that it is highly recommended to use pip install . (install) and pip install -e . (developer install) to install packages, as invoking setup.py directly will do the wrong things for many dependencies like pulling prereleases and incompatible packages versions and make the package hard to uninstall with pip.

So it\'s like installing but instead of copying to the site-packages it adds a symbolic link (the .egg-link acts as a multiplatform symbolic link).

This is useful when you are the developer of that project hence the name develop. If you are just installing someone else\'s package you should use installAnother thing that people may find useful when using the develop method is the --user option to install without sudo.
