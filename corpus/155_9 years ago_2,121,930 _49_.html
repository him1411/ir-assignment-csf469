How can a column with a default value be added to an existing table in SQL Server 2000 / SQL Server 2005?The inclusion of the DEFAULT fills the column in existing rows with the default value, so the NOT NULL constraint is not violated. When adding a nullable column, WITH VALUES will ensure that the specific DEFAULT value is applied to existing rows:Beware when the column you are adding has a NOT NULL constraint, yet does not have a DEFAULT constraint (value). The ALTER TABLE statement will fail in that case if the table has any rows in it. The solution is to either remove the NOT NULL constraint from the new column, or provide a DEFAULT constraint for it.The most basic version with two lines onlyUse:If you want to add multiple columns you can do it this way for example:Use:Reference: ALTER TABLE (Transact-SQL) (MSDN)In SQL Server 2008-R2, I go to the design mode - in a test database - and add my two columns using the designer and made the settings with the GUI, and then the infamous Right-Click gives the option "Generate Change Script"!Bang up pops a little window with, you guessed it, the properly formatted guaranteed-to-work change script. Hit the easy button.You can do the thing with T-SQL in the following way.As well as you can use SQL Server Management Studio also by right clicking table in the Design menu, setting the default value to table.And furthermore, if you want to add the same column (if it does not exists) to all tables in database, then use:Alternatively, you can add a default without having to explicitly name the constraint:If you have an issue with existing default constraints when creating this constraint then they can be removed by:To add a column to an existing database with a default value, we can use:Here is another way to add a column to an existing database with a default value.A much more thorough SQL script to add a column with a default value is below including checking if the column exists before adding it also checkin the constraint and dropping it if there is one. This script also names the constraint so we can have a nice naming convention (I like DF_) and if not SQL will give us a constraint with a name which has a randomly generated number; so it\'s nice to be able to name the constraint too.These are two ways to add a column to an existing database with a default value.The MSDN article ALTER TABLE (Transact-SQL) has all of the alter table syntax.Example:Example:This can also be done in the SSMS GUI. I showed a default date below but the default value can be whatever, of course.SQL Server + Alter Table + Add Column + Default Value uniqueidentifier Try thisFirst create a table with name student:Add one column to it:The table is created and a column is added to an existing table with a default value.Add a new column to a table:For example,If the user wants to make it auto incremented then:This can be done by the below code.This has a lot of answers, but I feel the need to add this extended method. This seems a lot longer, but it is extremely useful if you\'re adding a NOT NULL field to a table with millions of rows in an active database.What this will do is add the column as a nullable field and with the default value, update all fields to the default value (or you can assign more meaningful values), and finally it will change the column to be NOT NULL.The reason for this is if you update a large scale table and add a new not null field it has to write to every single row and hereby will lock out the entire table as it adds the column and then writes all the values.This method will add the nullable column which operates a lot faster by itself, then fills the data before setting the not null status.I\'ve found that doing the entire thing in one statement will lock out one of our more active tables for 4-8 minutes and quite often I have killed the process. This method each part usually takes only a few seconds and causes minimal locking.Additionally, if you have a table in the area of billions of rows it may be worth batching the update like so:From this query you can add a column of datatype integer with default value 0.SQL Server + Alter Table + Add Column + Default Value uniqueidentifier...If the default is Null, then:Done!Well, I now have some modification to my previous answer. I have noticed that none of the answers mentioned IF NOT EXISTS. So I am going to provide a new solution of it as I have faced some problems altering the table.Here TaskSheet is the particular table name and IsBilledToClient is the new column which you are going to insert and 1 the default value. That means in the new column what will be the value of the existing rows, therefore one will be set automatically there. However, you can change as you wish with the respect of the column type like I have used BIT, so I put in default value 1.I suggest the above system, because I have faced a problem. So what is the problem? The problem is, if the IsBilledToClient column does exists in the table table then if you execute only the portion of the code given below you will see an error in the SQL server Query builder. But if it does not exist then for the first time there will be no error when executing.You can use this query:
