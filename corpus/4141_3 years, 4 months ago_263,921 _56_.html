Using virtualenv, I run my projects with the default version of Python (2.7). On one project, I need to use Python 3.4. I used brew install python3 to install it on my Mac. Now, how do I create a virtualenv that uses the new version?e.g. sudo virtualenv envPython3If I try:I get:simply runUpdate after OP\'s edit:There was a bug in the OP\'s version of virtualenv, as described here. The problem was fixed by running:Python 3 has a built-in support for virtual environments - venv. It might be better to use that instead. Referring to the docs:Creation of virtual environments is done by executing the pyvenv\n  script:pyvenv /path/to/new/virtual/environmentUpdate for Python 3.6 and newer:As pawciobiel correctly comments, pyvenv is deprecated as of Python 3.6 and the new way is:I\'v tried pyenv and it\'s very handy for switching python versions (global, local in folder or in the virtualenv):then install Python version you want:and simply create virtualenv with path to needed interpreter version:That\'s it, check the version:There are also plugin for pyenv pyenv-virtualenv but it didn\'t work for me somehow.Install prerequisites.Create a Python3 based virtual environment. Optionally enable --system-site-packages flag.Set into the virtual environment.Install other requirements using pip package manager.When working on multiple python projects simultaneously it is usually recommended to install common packages like Django globally and then reuse them in virtualenvs.Using this technique saves a lot of time spent on fetching packages and installing them, apart from consuming minimal disk space and network bandwidth.worked for me.In addition to the other answers, I recommend checking what instance of virtualenv you are executing:If this turns up something in /usr/local/bin, then it is possible - even likely - that you installed virtualenv (possibly using an instance of easy_tools or pip) without using your system\'s package manager (brew in OP\'s case).  This was my problem.Years ago - when I was even more ignorant - I had installed virtualenv and it was masking my system\'s package-provided virtualenv.  After removing this old, broken virtualenv, my problems went away.Python now comes with its own implementation of virtual environment, by the name of "venv". I would suggest using that, instead of virtualenv.Quoting from venv - docs, Deprecated since version 3.6: pyvenv was the recommended tool for\n  creating virtual environments for Python 3.3 and 3.4, and is\n  deprecated in Python 3.6.Changed in version 3.5: The use of venv is now recommended for\n  creating virtual environments.For windows, to initiate venv on some project, open cmd:(Would suggest using double quote around directory path if it contains any spaces. Ex: "C:/My Dox/Spaced Directory/Something")Once venv is set up, you will see some new folders inside your project directory. One of them would be "Scripts".To activate or invoke venv you need:You can deactivate a virtual environment by typing \xe2\x80\x9cdeactivate\xe2\x80\x9d in your shell. With this, you are now ready to install your project specific libraries, which will reside under the folder "Lib".================================ Edit 1 ==================================== \nThe scenario which will be discussed below is not what originally asked, just adding this in case someone use vscode with  python extensionIn case, you use vs code with its python extension, you might face an issue with its pylint which points to the global installation. In this case, pylint won\'t be able to see the modules that are installed in your virtual environment and hence will show errors while importing.Here is a simple method to get past this.We are basically activating the environment first and then invoking vs-code so that pylint starts within the environment and can see all local packages.virtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 <VIRTUAL ENV NAME>\nthis will add python3\n path for your virtual enviroment. It worked for meIf you install python3 (brew install python3) along with virtualenv burrito, you can then do  mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3) env_nameOf course, I know virtualenv burrito is just a wrapper, but it has served me well over the years, reducing some learning curves.On Mac I had to do the following to get it to work.I tried all the above stuff, it still didn\'t work. So as a brute force, I just re-installed the anaconda, re-installed the virtualenv... and it worked.For those having troubles while working with Anaconda3 (Python 3).You could use To activate the environment ( Linux, MacOS)For WindowsI wanted to keep python 2.7.5 as default version on Centos 7 but have python 3.6.1 in a virtual environment running alongside other virtual environments in python 2.xI found the below link the best solution for the newest python version ( python 3.6.1)\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-install-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-for-python-3.\nIt shows the steps for different platforms but the basic steps areI got the same error due to it being a conflict with miniconda3 install so when you type "which virtualenv" and if you\'ve installed miniconda and it\'s pointing to that install you can either remove it (if your like me and haven\'t moved to it yet) or change your environment variable to point to the install you want.I had the same ERROR message. tbrisker\'s solution did not work in my case. Instead this solved the issue:
