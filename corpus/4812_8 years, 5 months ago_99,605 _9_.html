I\'m working on a little something and I am trying to figure out whether I can load an XDocument from a string. XDocument.Load() seems to take the string passed to it as a path to a physical XML file.I want to try and bypass the step of first having to create the physical XML file and jump straight to populating the XDocument.Any ideas?You can use XDocument.Parse for this.You can use XDocument.Parse(string) instead of Load(string).How about this...?This was taken from the MSDN docs for XDocument.Load, found here...http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb299692.aspxTry the Parse method.
