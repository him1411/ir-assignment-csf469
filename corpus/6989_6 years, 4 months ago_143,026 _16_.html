I need a way to get a dictionary value if its key exists, or simply return None, if it does not.However, Python returns a key_error if you search for a key that does not exist. I know that I can check for the key, but I am looking for something more explicit. Is there a way to just return None if the key does not exist ?You can use get()which will return None if key is not in d. You can also provide a different default value that will be returned instead of None:Wonder no more. It\'s built into the language.Use dict.getYou should use the get() method from the dict classThis will result in r == None.  If the key isn\'t found in the dictionary, the get function returns the second argument.If you want a more transparent solution, you can subclass dict to get this behavior:I usually use a defaultdict for situations like this. You supply a factory method that takes no arguments and creates a value when it sees a new key. It\'s more useful when you want to return something like an empty list on new keys (see the examples).You could use a dict object\'s get() method, as others have already suggested. Alternatively, depending on exactly what you\'re doing, you might be able use a try/except suite like this:Which is considered to be a very "Pythonic" approach to handling the case.As others have said above, you can use get().But to check for a key, you can also do:There\'s also the hasattr built-in funtion:You could override missing(self, key) by subclassing dict and return None.
