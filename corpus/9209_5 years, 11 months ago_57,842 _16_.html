Is there a way to disable SQL query logging when I\'m executing commands in the console? Ideally, it would be great if I can just disable it and re-enable it with a command in the console.I\'m trying to debug something and using "puts" to print out some relevant data. However, the sql query output is making it hard to read.Edit:\nI found another solution, since setting the logger to nil sometimes raised an error, if something other than my code tried to call logger.warnInstead of setting the logger to nil you can set the level of the logger to 1.To turn it off:To turn it back on:Here\'s a variation I consider somewhat cleaner, that still allows potential other logging from AR. In config/environments/development.rb :This might not be a suitable solution for the console, but Rails has a method for this problem: Logger#silenceIn case someone wants to actually knock out SQL statement logging (without changing logging level, and while keeping the logging from their AR models):The line that writes to the log (in Rails 3.2.16, anyway) is the call to debug in lib/active_record/log_subscriber.rb:50.That debug method is defined by ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber.So we can knock out the logging by overwriting it like so:For Rails 4 you can put the following in an environment file:In Rails 3.2 I\'m doing something like this in config/environment/development.rb:I used this: config.log_level = :info\nedit-in config/environments/performance.rbWorking great for me, rejecting SQL output, and show only rendering and important info.
