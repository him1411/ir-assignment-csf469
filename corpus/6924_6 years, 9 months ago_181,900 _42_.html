I\'m trying to create an always-op-top button/clickable-image\nwhich stays on top of all the windows all the time. The proof of\nconcept is I have been successful and have a running service now. The service\ndisplays some text on top left corner of screen all the time while\nuser can freely interact with rest of apps in normal manner. What I\'m\ndoing is subclass ViewGroup and add it to root window manager with\nflag TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY. Now I want to add a button/clickable-image\nin place of this text which can receive touch events on itself. I\ntried overriding "onTouchEvent" for the whole ViewGroup but it does\nnot receive any event. How can I receive events only on certain parts\nof my always-on-top view group? Kindly suggest.This might be a stupid solution. But it works. If you can improve it, please let me know.OnCreate of your Service: I have used WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_WATCH_OUTSIDE_TOUCH flag. This is the only change in service.Now, you will start getting each and every click event. So, you need to rectify in your event handler.In your ViewGroup touch eventAlso you may need to add this permission to your manifest:Following @Sam Lu\'s answer,\nIndeed Android 4.x blocks certain types from listening to outside touch events, but some types, such as TYPE_SYSTEM_ALERT, still do the job. Starting with Android 4.x, Android team fixed a potential \nsecurity problem by adding a new function adjustWindowParamsLw() in which it \nwill add FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE, FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE and remove FLAG_WATCH_OUTSIDE_TOUCH flags for TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY windows.That is, a TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY window won\'t receive any touch event on ICS platform and, of course, to use TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY is not a workable solution for ICS and future devices.I\'m one of the developers of the Tooleap SDK. We also provide a way for developers to display always on top windows and buttons, and and we have dealt with a similar situation.One problem the answers here haven\'t addressed is that of the Android "Secured Buttons".Secured buttons have the filterTouchesWhenObscured property which means they can\'t be interacted with, if placed under a window, even if that window does not receive any touches. Quoting the Android documentation:Specifies whether to filter touches when the view\'s window is obscured\n  by another visible window. When set to true, the view will not receive\n  touches whenever a toast, dialog or other window appears above the\n  view\'s window. Refer to the {@link android.view.View} security\n  documentation for more details.An example of such a button is the install button when you try to install third party apks. Any app can display such a button if adding to the view layout the following line:If you display an always-on-top window over a "Secured Button", so all the secured button parts that are covered by an overlay will not handle any touches, even if that overlay is not clickable. So if you are planing to display such a window, you should provide a way for the user to move it or dismiss it.\nAnd if a part of your overlay is transparent, take into account that your user might be confused why is a certain button in the underlying app is not working for him suddenly.WORKING ALWAYS ON TOP IMAGE BUTTONfirst of all sorry for my englishi edit your codes and make working image button that listens his touch event\ndo not give touch control to his background elements.also it gives touch listeners to out of other elementsbutton alingments are  bottom and leftyou can chage alingments but you need to chages cordinats in touch event in the if elementTry this. Works fine in ICS.\nIf You want to stop service simply click the notification generated in statusbar. UPDATESample hereTo create an overlay view, when setting up the LayoutParams DON\'T set the type to TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY.Actually, you can try WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_SYSTEM_ERROR instead of TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY. It may sound like a hack, but it let you display view on top of everything and still get touch events.It uses permission "android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" full tutorial on this link : http://androidsrc.net/facebook-chat-like-floating-chat-heads/Well try my code, atleast it gives you a string as overlay, you can very well replace it with a button or an image. You wont believe this is my first ever android app LOL. Anyways if you are more experienced with android apps than me, please tryIf anyone still reading this thread and not able to get this working, I\'m very sorry to tell you this way to intercept motion event is considered as bug and fix in android >=4.2.The motion event you intercepted, although has action as ACTION_OUTSIDE, return 0 in getX\nand getY. This means you can not see all the motion position on screen, nor can you do anything. I know the doc said It will get x and y, but the truth is it WILL NOT.  It seems that this is to block key logger.If anyone do have a workaround, please leave your comment.ref: \nWhy does ACTION_OUTSIDE return 0 everytime on KitKat 4.4.2?https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=72746by using service you can achieve this : @Sarwar Erfan\'s answer does not work any longer as Android does not allow adding view with WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY to window to be touchable anymore not with even WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_WATCH_OUTSIDE_TOUCH. I found solution to this problem. You can check it out in following questionWhen adding view to window with WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY, it is not getting touch eventHere is some simple solution,\nAll you need is to inflate XML layout just like you do on list adapters, \njust make XML layout to inflate it.\nHere is code that all you need.
