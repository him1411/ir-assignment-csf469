What would cause a page to be canceled? I have a screenshot of the Chrome Developer Tools.This happens often but not every time. It seems like once some other resources are cached, a page refresh will load the LeftPane.aspx. And what\'s really odd is this only happens in Google Chrome, not Internet Explorer 8. Any ideas why Chrome would cancel a request?We fought a similar problem where Chrome was canceling requests to load things within frames or iframes, but only intermittently and it seemed dependent on the computer and/or the speed of the internet connection.This information is a few months out of date, but I built Chromium from scratch, dug through the source to find all the places where requests could get cancelled, and slapped breakpoints on all of them to debug. From memory, the only places where Chrome will cancel a request:In our case we finally traced it down to one frame trying to append HTML to another frame, that sometimes happened before the destination frame even loaded. Once you touch the contents of an iframe, it can no longer load the resource into it (how would it know where to put it?) so it cancels the request.status=canceled may happen also on ajax requests on JavaScript events:The event successfully sends the request, but is is canceled then (but processed by the server). The reason is, the  elements submit forms on click events, no matter if you make any ajax requests on the same click event.To prevent request from being cancelled, JavaScript event.preventDefault(); have to be called:You might want to check the "X-Frame-Options" header tag.  If its set to SAMEORIGIN or DENY then the iFrame insertion will be canceled by Chrome (and other browsers) per the spec.Also, note that some browsers support the ALLOW-FROM setting but Chrome does not.To resolve this, you will need to remove the "X-Frame-Options" header tag.  This could leave you open to clickjacking attacks so you will need to decide what the risks are and how to mitigate them.Another thing to look out for could be the AdBlock extension, or extensions in general.But "a lot" of people have AdBlock....To rule out extension(s) open a new tab in incognito making sure that "allow in incognito is off" for the extention(s) you want to test.Here\'s what happened to me: the server was returning a malformed "Location" header for a 302 redirect.\nChrome failed to tell me this, of course. I opened the page in firefox, and immediately discovered the problem.\nNice to have multiple tools :)In my case, I found that it is jquery global timeout settings, a jquery plugin setup global timeout to 500ms, so that when the request exceed 500ms, chrome will cancel the request.A cancelled request happened to me when redirecting between secure and non-secure pages on separate domains within an iframe.  The redirected request showed in dev tools as a "cancelled" request.I have a page with an iframe containing a form hosted by my payment gateway. When the form in the iframe was submitted, the payment gateway would redirect back to a URL on my server.  The redirect recently stopped working and ended up as a "cancelled" request instead. It seems that Chrome (I was using Windows 7 Chrome 30.0.1599.101) no longer allowed a redirect within the iframe to go to a non-secure page on a separate domain. To fix it, I just made sure any redirected requests in the iframe were always sent to secure URLs.  When I created a simpler test page with only an iframe, there was a warning in the console (which I had previous missed or maybe didn\'t show up):The redirect turned into a cancelled request in Chrome on PC, Mac and Android. I don\'t know if it is specific to my website setup (SagePay Low Profile) or if something has changed in Chrome.NB: Make sure you don\'t have any wrapping form elements.I had a similar issue where my button with onclick={} was wrapped in a form element. When clicking the button the form is also submitted, and that messed it all up...This answer will probably never be read by anyone, but I figured why not write it :)I had the exact same thing with two CSS files that were stored in another folder outside my main css folder. I\'m using Expression Engine and found that the issue was in the rules in my htaccess file. I just added the folder to one of my conditions and it fixed it. Here\'s an example:So it might be worth you checking your htaccess file for any potential conflictsChrome Version 33.0.1750.154 m consistently cancels image loads if I am using the Mobile Emulation pointed at my localhost; specifically with User Agent spoofing on (vs. just Screen settings). When I turn User Agent spoofing off; image requests aren\'t canceled, I see the images.I still don\'t understand why; in the former case, where the request is cancelled the Request Headers (CAUTION: Provisional headers are shown) have onlyIn the latter case, all of those plus others like:ShrugI got this error in Chrome when I redirected via JavaScript:As you see I forgot the \'http://\'. After I added it, it worked.happened to me the same when calling a. js file with $. ajax, and make an ajax request, what I did was call normally.In my case the code to show e-mail client window caused Chrome to stop loading images:moving it to $(window).load(function () {...}) instead of $(function () {...}) helped.In can this helps anybody I came across the cancelled status when I left out the return false; in the form submit. This caused the ajax send to be immediately followed by the submit action, which overwrote the current page. The code is shown below, with the important return false at the end.Hope that helps someone.For anyone coming from LoopbackJS and attempting to use the custom stream method like provided in their chart example. I was getting this error using a PersistedModel, switching to a basic Model fixed my issue of the eventsource status cancelling out. Again, this is specifically for the loopback api. And since this is a top answer and top on google i figured i\'de throw this in the mix of answers.I had faced the same issue, somewhere deep in our code we had this pseudocode:onload of iframe submit a form After 2 seconds, remove the iframethus, when the server takes more than 2 seconds to respond the iframe to which the server was writing the response to, was removed, but the response was still to be written , but there was no iframe to write , thus chrome cancelled the request, thus to avoid this I made sure that the iframe is removed only after the response is over, or you can change the target to "_blank".\nThus one of the reason is:\nwhen the resource(iframe in my case) that you are writing something in, is removed or deleted before you stop writing to it, the request will be cancelledFor my case, I had an anchor with click event likeInside click event i had some network call, chorme cancelling the request. The anchor has href with "" means trying to go initial(empty) route and the same time it has click event with network call!! Whenever i replace the href with void likeThe problem went away!Another place we\'ve encountered the (canceled) status is in a particular TLS certificate misconfiguration.  If a site such as https://www.example.com is misconfigured such that the certificate does not include the www. but is valid for https://example.com, chrome will cancel this request and automatically redirect to the latter site.  This is not the case for Firefox.Currently valid example: https://www.pthree.org/
