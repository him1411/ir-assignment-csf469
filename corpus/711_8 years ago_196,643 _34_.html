I don\'t use the RI or RDoc output from the gems I install in my machine or in the servers I handle (I use other means of documentation).Every gem I install installs RI and RDoc documentation by default, because I forget to set --no-ri --no-rdoc.Is there a way to make those two flags the default?You just add following line to your local ~/.gemrc file (it is in your home folder)or you can add this line to the global gemrc config file. Here is how to find it (in Linux)From RVM\xe2\x80\x99s documentation:Just add this line to your ~/.gemrc or /etc/gemrc:Note: The original answer was:This is no longer valid; the RVM docs have since been updated, thus the current answer to only include the gem directive is the correct one.Note that --no-ri and --no-rdoc have been deprecated according to the new guides.

However, the system-wide gemrc will not always necessarily go into /etc/gemrc. If you are using RVM, or you have Ruby installed under /usr/local/bin, it needs to go in a different location. You can find this location by running irb and typing...See the original post on this over here.On Windows7 the .gemrc file is not present, you can let Ruby create one like this (it\'s not easy to do this in explorer).You will have to confirm (it\'s unsafe).\nNow the file is created in your userprofile folder (c:\\users\\)You can edit the textfile to remove the source you added or you can remove it withFor Windows users, Ruby doesn\'t set up .gemrc file.
