Is there a way to drop the shadow only on the bottom?. I have a menu with 2 images next to eachother. I don\'t want a right shadow because it overlaps the right image. I don\'t like to use images for this so is there a way to drop it only on the bottom like: box-shadow-bottom: 10px #FFF; or similar?Same like update 3 but with modern css (=less rules) so that no special positioning on the pseudo element is required.All my previous answers have been using extra markup to get create this effect, which is not necessarily needed. I think this a much cleaner solution... the only trick is playing around with the values to get the right positioning of the shadow as well as the right strength/opacity of the shadow. Here\'s a new fiddle, using pseudo-elements:http://jsfiddle.net/UnsungHero97/ARRRZ/2/HTMLCSSApparently, you can do this with just an extra parameter to the box-shadow CSS as everyone else just pointed out. Here\'s the demo:http://jsfiddle.net/K88H9/821/CSSThis would be a better solution. The extra parameter that is added is described as:The fourth length is a spread\n  distance. Positive values cause the\n  shadow shape to expand in all\n  directions by the specified radius.\n  Negative values cause the shadow shape\n  to contract.Check out the demo at jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/K88H9/4/What I did was create a "shadow element" that would hide behind the actual element that you would want to have a shadow. I made the width of the "shadow element" to be exactly less wide than the actual element by 2 times the shadow you specify; then I aligned it properly.HTMLCSSYes, you can do this with the same syntax you have provided. The first value controls the horizontal positioning and the second value controls the vertical positioning. So just set the first value to 0px and the second to whatever offset you\'d like as follows:For more info on box shadows, check out these: I hope this helps.Just use the spread parameter to make the shadow smaller:Live demo: http://dabblet.com/gist/a8f8ba527f5cff607327To not see any shadow on the sides, the (absolute value of the) spread radius (4th parameter) needs to be the same as the blur radius (3rd parameter).If you have a fixed color on the background, you can hide the side-shadow effect with two masking shadows having the same color of the background and blur = 0, example:Note that the black shadow must be the last, and has a negative spread (-3px) in order to prevent it from extendig beyond the corners.Here the fiddle (change the color of the masking shadows to see how it really works).It\'s always better to read the specs. There is no box-shadow-bottom property, and as Lea points out you should always place the un-prefixed property at the bottom, after the prefixed ones.So it\'s:I think this is what you\'re after?How about just using a containing div which has an overflow set to hidden and some padding at the bottom?  This seems like much the simplest solution.Sorry to say I didn\'t think of this myself but saw it somewhere else.Using an element to wrap the element getting the box-shadow and a overflow: hidden on the wrapper you could make the extra box-shadow disappear and still have a usable border.\n  This also fixes the problem where the element is smaller as it seems, because of the spread.Like this:Content goes hereStill a clever solution when it has to be done in pure CSS!As said by Jorgen Evens.I also needed a shadow but only under an image and set in slightly left and right. This worked for me:The element this is applied to is a page-wide image (980px x 300px).If it helps when fiddling with the settings, they run as follows:horizontal shadow, vertical shadow, blur distance, spread (i.e. shadow size), and color.If your background is solid (or you can reproduce it using CSS), you can use linear gradient that way:This will generate a 5px gradient at the bottom of the element, from black at 30% opacity to completely transparent. The rest of the element has white background. Of course, changing the last 2 color stops of the linear gradient, you could make the background completely transparent.update on someone else his answer transparant sides instead of white so it works on other color backgrounds too.inner shadow
