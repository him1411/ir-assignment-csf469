Is there any way to execute same code for different elements on the page?instead to do something like:ThanksOr:I normally use on instead of click. It allow me to add more events listeners to a specific function.Hope it helps!Make sure you put a space like $(\'.class1,space here.class2\') else it wont workSimply use $(\'.myclass1, .myclass2, .myclass3\') for multiple selectors. Also, you dont need lambda functions to bind an existing function to the click event.Another alternative, assuming your elements are stored as variables (which is often a good idea if you\'re accessing them multiple times in a function body):Takes advantage of jQuery chaining and allows you to use references.We can code like following also, I have used blur event here.I have a link to an object containig many input fields, which requires to be handled by the same event. So I simply use find() to get all the inside objects, that need to have the eventIn case your objects are one level down the link children() instead find() method can be used.In addition to the excellent examples and answers above, you can also do a "find" for two different elements using their classes. For example:This should output "HelloWorld".
