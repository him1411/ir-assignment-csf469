I started working on my master branch thinking that my task would be easy. After a while I realised it would take more work and I want to do all this work in a new branch.  How can I create a new branch and take all these changes with me without dirtying master?If you hadn\'t made any commit yet, only (1: branch) and (3: checkout) would be enough.\nOr, in one command: git checkout -b newBranch.As mentioned in the git reset man page:Note: due to the "destructive" effect of a git reset --hard command (it does resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <commit> are discarded), I would rather go with a:, to make sure I\'m not losing any private file (not added to the index).\nThe --soft option won\'t touch the index file nor the working tree at all (but resets the head to <commit>, just like all modes do).Like stated in this question: Git: Create a branch from unstagged/uncommited changes on master: stash is not necessary. Just use:git checkout -b topic/newbranch Any uncommitted work will be taken along to the new branch.When committing you will get the following messagefatal: The current branch feature/NEWBRANCH has no upstream branch. To\n  push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, useJust do as suggested to create the branch remotely:git push --set-upstream origin feature/feature/NEWBRANCHFollow these steps:Create a new branch:Checkout new branch: (this will not reset your work.)Now commit your work on this new branch:Using above steps will keep your original branch clean and you dont have to do any \'git reset --hard\'.Since you haven\'t made any commits yet, you can save all your changes to the stash, create and switch to a new branch, then pop those changes back into your working tree:To add new changes to a new branch and push to remote:Often times I forget to add the origin part to push and get confused why I don\'t see the new branch/commit in bitbucket
