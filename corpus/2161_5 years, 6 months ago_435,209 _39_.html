In Visual Studio I can press Ctrl+K+D to indent everything so the code is structured nicely and readable. Is there a shortcut in Sublime 2 to do the same?You can find it in Edit \xe2\x86\x92 Line \xe2\x86\x92 Reindent, but it does not have a shortcut by default.\nYou can add a shortcut by going to the menu Preferences \xe2\x86\x92 Keybindings \xe2\x86\x92 User, then add there:(example of using the F12 key for that functionality)The config files use JSON-syntax, so these curly braces have to be placed comma-separated in the square-brackets that are there by default. If you dont have any other key-bindings already, then your whole Keybindings \xe2\x86\x92 User file would look like this, of course:The reindent command only works on the currently selected lines unless the "single_line" argument is set to false.Now, pressing f12 will reindent the entire document.No one seems to love mac re-indentation, So here How I do it:   In Preferences > Key Binding - UserOne more extra tip: \naddto have sidebar file tree view navigation using keyboard.

However you can create one by following eznme\'s answer above.You can also use the Command Palette by pressing:For those interested it is easy to change but for a lover of Netbeans and the auto-format you can change the key binding from F12 to ctrl+shift+F to use your beloved key binding. Sad part is that you have to select all to format the entire file. Netbeans still has the upper hand on that. If anyone knows how to overcome that limitation I\'m all ears. Otherwise happy reindenting (auto-formating).To indent with the same keys like Visual Studio Ctrl+K+D (I am a Visual Studio user so I am used to this combination) I suggest:Write this on Preferences>Key Bindings - UserIt is very simple. Just go to Edit=>Line=>ReindentGo to Preferences > Key Bindings > User and add the code below:UsageCtrl + Shift + FBeside of the inbuilt \'reindent\' function, you can also install other plugins, such as SublimeAStyleFormatter and CodeFormatter. These plugins are better for their specify language.Just in case this stop working for anyone like me, in OS X, the command key is identified as superso it should be able to do something like this:in this case using command+i is going to indent your whole code (eclipse like :) )Use Ctrl + ] in Sublime text to indent. simple to use.1.Install2.press ctrl + alt + f (default)Thats it.I used to use Alt + Shift + F in NetBeans, I checked and there isn\'t any collision in the default keymap array of sublime, so I added it to my sublime and I\'m using it without any problem.For Auto-Formatting in Sublime Text 2: Install Package: Tag from Command Palette, then go to Edit -> Tag -> Auto-Format Tags on DocumentThis is my configuration for sublime-keymap\n[\n  {\n    "keys": [",+=+="],\n    "command": "reindent",\n    "args": {\n      "single_line": false\n    }\n  }\n]\nFor vim people, just use ,== to reindent the whole file.First open the sublime text.\nthan open preferences.\nthan open Key Bindings -User.\nthan put the below code  [{"keys": ["ctrl+shift+c"], "command": "reindent"},]I use Ctrl+Shift+C and you also use other short cut key.For those who like the default key binding for IntelJ IDEA, select Preferences > Settings - User:And paste in the following to have the command + shift + l shortcut for auto indent:
