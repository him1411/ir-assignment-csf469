How would it be possible to include both bold and non-bold text in a uiLabel?I\'d rather not use a UIWebView.. I\'ve also read this may be possible using NSAttributedString but I have no idea how to use that. Any ideas?Apple achieves this in several of their apps;\nExamples Screenshot:  Thanks!\n- DomIn Swift we don\'t have to deal with iOS5 old stuff besides syntax is shorter so everything becomes really simple: Usage:Some people commented about internationalisation. I personally think this is out of scope of this question but for instructional purposes this is how I would do itResult (Assuming English and Japanese Localizable.strings are available)In iOS6 UILabel, UIButton, UITextView, UITextField, support attributed strings which means we don\'t need to create CATextLayers as our recipient for attributed strings. Furthermore to make the attributed string we don\'t need to play with CoreText anymore :) We have new classes in obj-c Foundation.framework like NSParagraphStyle and other constants that will make our life easier. Yay!So, if we have this string:We only need to create the attributed string:There is a couple of good introductory blog posts here from guys at invasivecode that explain with more examples uses of NSAttributedString, look for "Introduction to NSAttributedString for iOS 6" and "Attributed strings for iOS using Interface Builder" :)PS: Above code  it should work but it was brain-compiled. I hope it is enough :)Use a CATextLayer with an NSAttributedString ! much lighter and simpler than 2 UILabels. (iOS 3.2 and above)Example.Don\'t forget to add QuartzCore framework (needed for CALayers), and CoreText (needed for the attributed string.)Below example will add a sublayer to the toolbar of the navigation controller. \xc3\xa0 la Mail.app in the iPhone. :)In this example I only have two different types of font (bold and normal) but you could also have different font size, different color, italics, underlined, etc.\nTake a look at NSAttributedString / NSMutableAttributedString and CoreText attributes string keys.Hope it helpsTry a category on UILabel:Here\'s how it\'s used:And here\'s the categoryUILabel+Boldify.hUILabel+Boldify.mNote that this will only work in iOS 6 and later. It will simply be ignored in iOS 5 and earlier. There\'s category based on bbrame\'s category. It works similar, but allows you boldify same UILabel multiple times with cumulative results.UILabel+Boldify.hUILabel+Boldify.mWith this corrections you may use it multiple times, eg:will result with: "Updated: 2012/10/14 21:59 PM".That\'s easy to do in Interface Builder:1) make UILabel Attributed in Attributes Inspector2) select part of phrase you want to make bold3) change its font (or bold typeface of the same font) in font selectorThat\'s all!It worked for me: For Swift version: See HereCheck out TTTAttributedLabel. It\'s a drop-in replacement for UILabel that allows you to have mixed font and colors in a single label by setting an NSAttributedString as the text for that label.I\'ve adopted Crazy Yoghurt\'s answer to swift\'s extensions.May be there is not good conversion between Range and NSRange, but I didn\'t found something better.In this case you could try,Use the below code. I hope it help for you.To make text bold as well as underline in a UILabel. Just add the following lines in your code.If you want to make using attributed strings easier, try using Attributed String Creator, which will generate the code for you. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/attributed-string-creator/id730928349No need for NSRange with the following code I just implemented in my project (in Swift):
