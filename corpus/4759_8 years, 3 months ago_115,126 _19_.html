I want to know the number of CPUs on the local machine using Python. The result should be user/real as output by time(1) when called with an optimally scaling userspace-only program.If you have python with a version >= 2.6 you can simply usehttp://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.cpu_countIf you\'re interested into the number of processors available to your current process, you have to check cpuset first. Otherwise (or if cpuset is not in use), multiprocessing.cpu_count() is the way to go in Python 2.6. The following method falls back to a couple of alternative methods in older versions of Python:Another option is to use the psutil library, which always turn out useful in these situations:This should work on any platform supported by psutil(Unix and Windows).Note that in some occasions multiprocessing.cpu_count may raise a NotImplementedError while psutil will be able to obtain the number of CPUs. This is simply because psutil first tries to use the same techniques used by multiprocessing and, if those fail, it also uses other techniques.multiprocessing.cpu_count() will return the number of logical CPUs, so if you have a quad-core CPU with hyperthreading, it will return 8.  If you want the number of physical CPUs, use the python bindings to hwloc:hwloc is designed to be portable across OSes and architectures.In Python 3.4+: os.cpu_count().multiprocessing.cpu_count() is implemented in terms of this function but raises NotImplementedError if os.cpu_count() returns None ("can\'t determine number of CPUs").platform independent:psutil.cpu_count(logical=False)https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/blob/master/INSTALL.rstCan\'t figure out how to add to the code or reply to the message but here\'s support for jython that you can tack in before you give up:You can also use "joblib" for this purpose. This method will give you the number of cpus in the system. joblib needs to be installed though. More information on joblib can be found here       https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/parallel.htmlAlternatively you can use numexpr package of python. It has lot of simple functions helpful for getting information about the system cpu.Another option if you don\'t have Python 2.6:
