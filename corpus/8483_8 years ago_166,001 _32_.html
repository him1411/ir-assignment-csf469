I\'m currently using jQuery to make a div clickable and in this div I also have anchors. The problem I\'m running into is that when I click on an anchor both click events are firing (for the div and the anchor). How do I prevent the div\'s onclick event from firing when an anchor is clicked?Here\'s the broken code:JavaScriptHTMLEvents bubble to the highest point in the DOM at which a click event has been attached. So in your example, even if you didn\'t have any other explicitly clickable elements in the div, every child element of the div would bubble their click event up the DOM to until the DIV\'s click event handler catches it.There are two solutions to this is to check to see who actually originated the event. jQuery passes an eventargs object along with the event:You can also attach a click event handler to your links which tell them to stop event bubbling after their own handler executes:Use stopPropagation method, see an example:As said by jQuery Docs:stopPropagation method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM\n  tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event.Keep in mind that it does not prevent others listeners to handle this event(ex. more than one click handler for a button), if it is not the desired effect, you must use stopImmediatePropagation instead.Here my solution for everyone out there looking for a non-jQuery code (pure javascript)Your code wont be executed if clicked on parent\'s childsyou can also try thisIf you have multiple elements in the clickable div, you should do this:Using return false; or e.stopPropogation(); will not allow further code to execute. It will stop flow at this point itself.If you do not intend to interact with the inner element/s in any case, then a CSS solution might be useful for you.Just set the inner element/s to pointer-events: nonein your case:or to target all inner elements generally:This easy hack saved me a lot of time while developing with ReactJSBrowser support could be found here: http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-eventsYou need to stop the event from reaching (bubbling to) the parent (the div).\nSee the part about bubbling here, and jQuery-specific API info here.Writing if anyone needs (worked for me):From this solution.To specify some sub element as unclickable write the css hierarchy as in the example below.In this example I stop propagation to any elements (*) inside td inside tr inside a table with the class ".subtable"Here\'s an example using Angular 2+For example, if you wanted to close a Modal Component if the user clicks outside of it:add a as follows:or return false; from click handler for #clickable like:All solution are complicated and of jscript.  Here is the simplest version:
