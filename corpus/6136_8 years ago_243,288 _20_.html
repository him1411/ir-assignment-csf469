Is it possible to specify a condition in Count()? I would like to count only the rows that have for example "Manager" value in Position column.Edit: please read carefully, I want to do it IN count statement, not using WHERE; I\'m asking about it because I need to count both Managers and Other in the same select (something like Count(Position = Manager), Count(Poisition = Other)) so WHERE is no use for me in this exampleIf you can\'t just limit the query itself with a where clause, you can use the fact that the count aggregate only counts the non-null values:You can also use the sum aggregate in a similar way:Assuming you do not want to restrict the rows that are returned because you are aggregating other values as well, you can do it like this:Let\'s say within the same column you had values of Manager, Supervisor, and Team Lead, you could get the counts of each like this:Depends what you mean, but the other interpretation of the meaning is where you want to count rows with a certain value, but don\'t want to restrict the SELECT to JUST those rows...You\'d do it using SUM() with a clause in, like this instead of using COUNT():\ne.g.You can also use the Pivot Keyword if you are using SQL 2005 or abovemore info and from TechnetTest Data Set    @Guffa \'s answer is excellent, just point out that maybe is cleaner with an IF statementDo you mean just this:If so, then yup that works!I know this is really old, but I like the NULLIF trick for such scenarios, and I found no downsides so far. Just see my copy&pasteable example, which is not very practical though, but demonstrates how to use it.NULLIF might give you a small negative impact on performance, but I guess it should still be faster than subqueries.Comments appreciated :-)I think you can use a simple WHERE clause to select only the count some record.Simply add a WHERE clause and you\'re good to go.Using this you\'ll get the count for managers
