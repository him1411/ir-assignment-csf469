I have this string:Doingseems to only remove the first occurrence of abc in the string above. How can I replace all occurrences of it?For the sake of completeness, I got to thinking about which method I should use to do this. There are basically two ways to do this as suggested by the other answers on this page.Note: In general, extending the built-in prototypes in JavaScript is generally not recommended. I am providing as extensions on the String prototype simply for purposes of illustration, showing different implementations of a hypothetical standard method on the String built-in prototype.Not knowing too much about how regular expressions work behind the scenes in terms of efficiency, I tended to lean toward the split and join implementation in the past without thinking about performance. When I did wonder which was more efficient, and by what margin, I used it as an excuse to find out.On my Chrome WindowsÂ 8 machine, the regular expression based implementation is the fastest, with the split and join implementation being 53% slower. Meaning the regular expressions are twice as fast for the lorem ipsum input I used.Check out this benchmark running these two implementations against each other.As noted in the comment below by @ThomasLeduc and others, there could be an issue with the regular expression-based implementation if search contains certain characters which are reserved as special characters in regular expressions. The implementation assumes that the caller will escape the string beforehand or will only pass strings that are without the characters in the table in Regular Expressions (MDN).MDN also provides an implementation to escape our strings. It would be nice if this was also standardized as RegExp.escape(str), but alas, it does not exist:We could call escapeRegExp within our String.prototype.replaceAll implementation, however, I\'m not sure how much this will affect the performance (potentially even for strings for which the escape is not needed, like all alphanumeric strings).In response to comment:In response to Click Upvote\'s comment, you could simplify it even more:Note: Regular expressions contain special (meta) characters, and as such it is dangerous to blindly pass an argument in the find function above without pre-processing it to escape those characters.  This is covered in the Mozilla Developer Network\'s JavaScript Guide on Regular Expressions, where they present the following utility function:So in order to make the replaceAll() function above safer, it could be modified to the following if you also include escapeRegExp:Note: Don\'t use this in real code.As an alternative to regular expressions for a simple literal string, you could useThe general pattern isThis used to be faster in some cases than using replaceAll and a regular expression, but that doesn\'t seem to be the case anymore in modern browsers. So, this should really only be used as a quick hack to avoid needing to escape the regular expression, not in real code.Using a regular expression with the g flag set will replace all:Here\'s a string prototype function based on the accepted answer:EDIT If your find will contain special characters then you need to escape them:Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cdbzL/Update:It\'s somewhat late for an update, but since I just stumbled on this question, and noticed that my previous answer is not one I\'m happy with. Since the question involved replaceing a single word, it\'s incredible nobody thought of using word boundaries (\\b)This is a simple regex that avoids replacing parts of words in most cases. However, a dash - is still considered a word boundary. So conditionals can be used in this case to avoid replacing strings like cool-cat:basically, this question is the same as the question here:\nJavascript replace " ' " with " '' "@Mike, check the answer I gave there... regexp isn\'t the only way to replace multiple occurrences of a subsrting, far from it. Think flexible, think split!Alternatively, to prevent replacing word parts -which the approved answer will do, too! You can get around this issue using regular expressions that are, I admit, somewhat more complex and as an upshot of that, a tad slower, too:The output is the same as the accepted answer, however, using the /cat/g expression on this string:Oops indeed, this probably isn\'t what you want. What is, then? IMHO, a regex that only replaces \'cat\' conditionally. (ie not part of a word), like so:My guess is, this meets your needs. It\'s not fullproof, of course, but it should be enough to get you started. I\'d recommend reading some more on these pages. This\'ll prove useful in perfecting this expression to meet your specific needs.http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/regexp.shtmlhttp://www.regular-expressions.infoFinal addition:Given that this question still gets a lot of views, I thought I might add an example of .replace used with a callback function. In this case, it dramatically simplifies the expression and provides even more flexibility, like replacing with correct capitalisation or replacing both cat and cats in one go:Match against a global regular expression:Or try the replaceAll function from here:What are useful JavaScript methods that extends built-in objects?EDIT: Clarification about replaceAll availabilityThe \'replaceAll\' method is added to String\'s prototype. This means it will be available for all string objects/literals.E.g.Use a regular expression:This is the fastest version that doesn\'t use regular expressions.Revised jsperfIt is almost twice as fast as the split and join method.As pointed out in a comment here, this will not work if your omit variable contains place, as in: replaceAll("string", "s", "ss"), because it will always be able to replace another occurrence of the word.There is another jsperf with variants on my recursive replace that go even faster (http://jsperf.com/replace-all-vs-split-join/12)!//loop it until number occurrences comes to 0. OR simply copy/pasteSay you want to replace all the \'abc\' with \'x\':I was trying to think about something more simple than modifying the string prototype.Simple...Replacing single quotes:http://jsfiddle.net/ANHR9/If what you want to find is already in a string, and you don\'t have a regex escaper handy, you can use join/split:I like this method (it looks a little cleaner):If you are trying to ensure that the string you are looking for won\'t exist even after the replacement, you need to use a loop.For example:When complete, you will still have \'test abc\'!The simplest loop to solve this would be:But that runs the replacement twice for each cycle. Perhaps (at risk of being voted down) that can be combined for a slightly more efficient but less readable form:This can be particularly useful when looking for duplicate strings.\nFor example, if we have \'a,,,b\' and we wish to remove all duplicate commas.\n[In that case, one could do .replace(/,+/g,\',\'), but at some point the regex gets complex and slow enough to loop instead.]You can simply use below methodAlthough people have mentioned the use of regex but there\'s a better approach if you want to replace the text irrespective of the case of the text. Like uppercase or lowercase. Use below syntaxYou can refer the detailed example here.Just add /g to/g means globalMy implementation, very self explanatoryFollowing function works for me:now call the functions like this:Simply copy and paste this code in your browser console to TEST.I use p to store the result from the previous recursion replacement:It will replace all occurrences in the string s until it is possible:To avoid infinite loop I check if the replacement r contains a match m:Most people are likely doing this to encode a URL. To encode a URL, you shouldn\'t only consider spaces, but convert the entire string properly with encodeURI.to get:For replacing all kind of characters, try this code:So this method will solve this issue.I was using Ajax, and I had the need to send parameters in JSON format. Then my method is looking like this:If using a library is an option for you then you will get the benefits of the testing and community support that goes with a library function. For example, the string.js library has a replaceAll() function that does what you\'re looking for:Here is the working code with prototype:
