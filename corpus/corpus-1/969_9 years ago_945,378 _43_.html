Is there any way to get the ID of the element that fires an event?I\'m thinking something like:Except of course that the var test should contain the id "aaa", if the event is fired from the first form, and "bbb", if the event is fired from the second form.In jQuery event.target always refers to the element that triggered the event, where \'event\' is the parameter passed to the function. http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/Note also that \'this\' will also work, but that it is not a jQuery object, so if you wish to use a jQuery function on it then you must refer to it as \'$(this)\', e.g.:For reference, try this! It works!Though it is mentioned in other posts, I wanted to spell this out:$(event.target).id is undefined$(event.target)[0].id gives the id attribute.event.target.id also gives the id attribute.this.id gives the id attribute.and$(this).id is undefined.The differences, of course, is between jQuery objects and DOM objects. "id" is a DOM function so you have to be on the DOM element object to use it.(It tripped me up, so it probably tripped up someone else)For all events, not limited to just jQuery you can useWhere event.target fails it falls back on event.srcElement for IE.\nTo clarify the above code does not require jQuery but also works with jQuery.You can use (this) to reference the object that fired the function.\'this\' is a DOM element when you are inside of a callback function (in the context of jQuery), for example, being called by the click, each, bind, etc. methods.Here is where you can learn more: http://remysharp.com/2007/04/12/jquerys-this-demystified/I generate a table dynamically out a database, receive the data in JSON and put it into a table. Every table row got a unique ID, which is needed for further actions, so, if the DOM is altered you need a different approach:The source element as a jQuery object should be obtained viaThis gets you the source of the click, rather than the element that the click function was assigned too. Can be useful when the click event is on a parent object\nEG.a click event on a table row, and you need the cell that was clickedElement which fired event we have in event propertyWe get DOM node object on which was set event handler.Most nested node which started bubbling process we have inEvent object is always first attribute of event handler, example:More about event delegation You can read in http://maciejsikora.com/standard-events-vs-event-delegation/You can try to use:In the case of delegated event handlers, where you might have something like this:and your JS code like so:You\'ll more than likely find that itemId is undefined, as the content of the LI is wrapped in a <span>, which means the <span> will probably be the event target. You can get around this with a small check, like so:Or, if you prefer to maximize readability (and also avoid unnecessary repetition of jQuery wrapping calls):When using event delegation, the .is() method is invaluable for verifying that your event target (among other things) is actually what you need it to be. Use .closest(selector) to search up the DOM tree, and use .find(selector) (generally coupled with .first(), as in .find(selector).first()) to search down it. You don\'t need to use .first() when using .closest(), as it only returns the first matching ancestor element, while .find() returns all matching descendants.This works on a higher z-index than the event parameter mentioned in above answers:This way you will always get the id of the (in this example li) element. Also when clicked on a child element of the parent..Working JSFiddle here.this.element.attr("id") works fine in IE8.Use can Use .on eventBoth of these work,and Just use the this referenceor
