My .gitignore file seems to be being ignored by git - could the .gitignore file be corrupt?  Which file format, locale or culture does git expect?My .gitignore:Output from git status:I would like debug.log and nbproject/ not to appear in the untracked files list.Where should I start looking to fix this?Even if you haven\'t tracked the files so far, git seems to be able to "know" about them even after you add them to .gitignore. Then run the following commands from the top folder of your git repo:First commit your current changes or you will lose them.When .gitignore file is not working (adding something into .gitignore file or removing something from .gitignore file), you can check the following tips:When you add something into .gitignore file, as the person who answered\nthis question first:  When you remove something from .gitignore file.The above steps will\nnot work for you.  You can try this:the "filetype" means the file or filetype you want to remove from the .gitignore file. You want to make the filetype be tracked again.Fixed.  Ok, I created the .gitignore file in notepad on windows and it wasn\'t working.  When I viewed the .gitignore file in linux it looked like organised gibberish - perhaps notepad had written out unicode rather than ascii or whatever 8-bit is.So I rewrote the file on my linux box, and when I pulled it back into windows it works fine!  Hurrah!Without adding another commit to your project, one line will be enough to make .gitignore work as it is supposed to:Another cause of this issue is blank spaces or tabs before the statement:Example:And as pointed out by the comment bellow a trailing space can be an issue aswellI noticed that the encoding of the .gitignore was having an effect--if the file was Unicode, it was ignored, if it was ASCII, it wasn\'t.Process:Also check out the directory, where you put .gitignore\nIt should be in root of your project: not in All the answers here are actually workarounds. You need to create the .gitignore file BEFORE you run git init, otherwise git will never know you need to ignore those files because they have been tracked already.If you develop on a daily basis, I advise you to add your habitual ignored files to your ~/.gitignore_global file. That way, git will already know which files you (meaning "your user", since it\'s a file in your home directory) usually ignore.As with the other solutions, commit first and be aware that you WILL lose any un-committed changes.I had better results with this:note that the status should have no modified files now.There\'s another issue with .gitignore that might happen, especially for a windows user, git does not like it when you name .gitignore (such as unity.gitignore). You\'ll want to always name it .gitignore, or on windows, .gitignore.as windows thinks you are trying to rename it without a filename.For me none of the above answers worked. I had to copy .gitignore text into exclude.txt file found at Once done, refresh your changes and all the untracked files are gone. Commit as usual.I had this same problem. I believe the issue was a CR vs CR+LF discrepancy. I stashed things in my .gitignore using cmd (on windows 7) and the following command:   Bad:echo "file_to_be_ignored.py" >> .gitignore\n  echo "*~" >> .gitignoreEtc.The issue was that this command does not place the correct end-of-line marker for git to recognize the newlines (either CR or CR+LF when git expects the other). I solved the problem by manually replacing each newline in vim (vim to the rescue!) and it worked perfectly.Try editing your .gitignore in Notepad++ or vim (ideally), even if the file looks like it\'s formatted correctly, try replacing the newlines. Sounds weird, I know, but worked for me. :DOk, so in my case the accepted solution did not work, and what worked is described here:https://ericnelson.wordpress.com/2014/06/21/is-visual-studio-2013-ignoring-your-gitignore-file/In short:Hope this helps somebody sometimeOne thing to also look at, is are you saving your .gitignore file with the correct line endings?WINDOWS:\nIf you\'re using it in windows, are you saving it with windows line endings?  Not all programs will do this by default, notepad++ and many php editors default to linux line endings so the files will be server compatible.  One easy way to check this, is open the file in windows notepad.  If everything appears on one line, then the file was saved with linux line endings.LINUX:\nIf you are having trouble with the file working in a linux environment.  Open the file in an editor such as emacs or nano.  If you see any non-printable characters, then the file was saved with windows line endings.I had this problem, with a .gitignore containing this line:I just realized that in fact, this directory is a symbolic link to a folder somewhere else:On the line lib/ext/, git actually looks for a folder, but a symbolic link is a file, so my lib folder is not ignored.I fixed this by replacing lib/ext/ by lib/ext on my .gitignore.In my case, it\'s because the files already exist in the repo and I\'m trying to ignore it.These are the things I did to fix the issue:By then, any changes I made on those files were ignored.I think you can\'t ignore files that already exist on the repo.I just ran into this issue. The .gitignore file and its contents continued to appear in the list of untracked files.I was using this to create the ignore file:echo "node_modules" > .gitignoreIt turns out that the double quotations were causing the issue for me. I deleted the ignore file and then used the command again without quotes and it worked as expected. I did not need to mess with the file encoding. I\'m on a Win10 machine using Cmder. Example:echo node_modules > .gitignoreJust removed the folder or file which commit previously in git by following command, then gitignore file will reflect the correct files.
