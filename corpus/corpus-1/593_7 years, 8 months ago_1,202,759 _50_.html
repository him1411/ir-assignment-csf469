I have added a file named "file1.txt" to git repo. After that I committed it, added a couple directories called dir1 and dir2, and committed them to git repo.  Now the current repo has "file1.txt", dir1 and dir2.\nHow can I delete "file1.txt" without affecting others like dir1 and dir2?Use git rm:But if you want to remove the file only from the Git repository and not remove it from the filesystem, use:  And to push changes to remote repogit rm file.txt removes the file from the repo but also deletes it from the local file system.To remove the file from the repo and not delete it from the local file system use:\ngit rm --cached file.txt The below exact situation is where I use git to maintain version control for my business\'s website, but the "mickey" directory was a tmp folder to share private content with a CAD developer. When he needed HUGE files, I made a private, unlinked directory and ftpd the files there for him to fetch via browser. Forgetting I did this, I later performed a git add -A from the website\'s base directory. Subsequently, git status showed the new files needing committing. Now I needed to delete them from git\'s tracking and version control...Sample output below is from what just happened to me, where I unintentionally deleted the .003 file.
