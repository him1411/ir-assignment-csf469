To redirect stdout to a truncated file in Bash, I know to use:To redirect stdout in Bash, appending to a file, I know to use:To redirect both stdout and stderr to a truncated file, I know to use:How do I redirect both stdout and stderr appending to a file? cmd &>> file.txt did not work for me.Bash executes the redirects from left to right as follows:There are two ways to do this, depending on your Bash version.The classic and portable (Bash pre-4) way is:A nonportable way, starting with Bash 4 is(analog to &> outfile)For good coding style, you shouldIf your script already starts with #!/bin/sh (no matter if intended or not), then the Bash 4 solution, and in general any Bash-specific code, is not the way to go.Also remember that Bash 4 &>> is just shorter syntax \xe2\x80\x94 it does not introduce any new functionality or anything like that.The syntax is (beside other redirection syntax) described here: http://bash-hackers.org/wiki/doku.php/syntax/redirection#appending_redirected_output_and_error_outputIn Bash you can also explicitly specify your redirects to different files:Appending would be:In Bash 4 (as well as ZSH 4.3.11):just out of boxThis should work fine:It will store all logs in file.txt as well as dump them on terminal.Try thisYour usage of &>x.file does work in bash4. sorry for that : (0, 1, 2...9 are file descriptors in bash. \n0 stands for stdin, 1 stands for stdout, 2 stands for stderror. 3~9 is spare for any other temporary usage.Any file descriptor can be redirected to other file descriptor or file by using operator > or >>(append).Usage: \n<file_descriptor> > <filename | &file_descriptor>Please reference to http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/io-redirection.html
