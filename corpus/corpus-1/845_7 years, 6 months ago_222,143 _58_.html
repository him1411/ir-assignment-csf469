I am making the effort to learn Vim.When I paste code into my document from the clipboard, I get extra spaces at the start of each new line:I know you can turn off auto indent but I can\'t get it to work because I have some other settings conflicting or something (which look pretty obvious in my .vimrc but don\'t seem to matter when I take them out). How do I turn off auto indenting when I paste code but still have vim auto indent when I am writing code?  Here is my .vimrc file:To turn off autoindent when you paste code, there\'s a special "paste" mode.Type Then paste your code.  Note that the text in the tooltip now says -- INSERT (paste) --.After you pasted your code, turn off the paste-mode, so that auto-indenting when you type works correctly again.However, I always found that cumbersome.  That\'s why I map <F3> such that it can switch between paste and nopaste modes while editing the text!  I add this to .vimrcA useful command to have in your .vimrc is set pastetoggle=<F10> or some other button, to easily toggle between paste and nopaste.I usually use :r! cat and then paste ( shift + insert ) the content, and CTRL+D.No need to enable & disable, direct usage.If you are working locally, you can paste from the system clipboard with the key sequence:"+pThis is a proper vim command, so no need to worry about entering an insert mode or switching off autoindent first.Of course if you are working remotely (console over SSH, for example) then this won\'t work and you should go the :set noai, insert mode, paste into console, leave insertmode, :set ai route as described elsewhere.Mac users can avoid auto formatting by reading directly from the pasteboard with:Here is a post by someone who figured out how to remap the paste event to automatically turn paste mode on and then back off. Works for me in tmux/iTerm on MacOSX.Add this to your ~/.vimrc and you will only have to press F2 before and after pasting:While setting the paste mode with paste/nopaste/pastetoggle is perfectly fine, you still have to manually enable paste mode before pasting and disable paste mode after pasting. Being the lazy person that I am, below is the best solution that I\'ve found so far, which automatically toggles the paste mode when you paste.Here\'s a little trick that uses terminal\'s bracketed paste mode to\n  automatically set/unset Vim\'s paste mode when you paste. Put following\n  in your .vimrc:Now you can paste without explicitly turning paste mode on/off - it is\n  handled automatically for you.Source: CoderwallWhen working inside a terminal the vim-bracketed-paste vim plugin will automatically handle pastes without needing any keystrokes before or after the paste.It works by detecting bracketed paste mode which is an escape sequence sent by "modern" x-term compatible terminals like iTerm2, gnome-terminal, and other terminals using libvte. As an added bonus it works also for tmux sessions. I am using it successfully with iTerm2 on a Mac connecting to a linux server and using tmux.Stick this in your ~/.vimrc and be happy:Edit: on reflection, :r !cat is a far better approach since it\'s short, semantic, and requires no custom vimrc. Use that instead!I just put set clipboard=unnamed in my .vimrc. That makes the default paste buffer map to X\'s clipboard.So, if I mark a bit of text in a terminal, I can simply press p to paste it in vim. Similarly, I can yank things in vim (e.g. YY to yank the current line into the buffer) and middle click in any window to paste it.Dunno. I find it super convenient.This works for me ( case for + register, what i use like exchange buffer between aps ):If you are on a mac, macvim seems to handle it well without having to toggle paste.brew install macvim --override-system-vimPlease read this article: Toggle auto-indenting for code pasteSome people like the visual feedback shown in the status line by the following alternative for your vimrc:The fastest way I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of to quickly go to paste-insert mode for a one-shot paste is tpope\xe2\x80\x99s unimpaired, which features yo and yO, presumably mnemonics for \xe2\x80\x9cyou open\xe2\x80\x9d. They\xe2\x80\x99re only documented in his vimdoc, as:A toggle has not been provided for \'paste\' because the typical use case of\n  wrapping of a solitary insertion is so wasteful:  You toggle twice, but\n  you only paste once (YOPO).  Instead, press yo or yO to invoke o or O with\n  \'paste\' already set.  Leaving insert mode sets \'nopaste\' automatically.Although :pastetoggle or :paste and :nopaste should be working fine (if implemented - they are not always as we can see from the discussion) I highly recomment pasting using the direct approach "+p or "*p and reading with "+r or "*r:Vim has acess to ten types of registers (:help registers) and the questioner is interested in quotestar and quoteplus from sectionUse these registers for storing and retrieving the selected text for the GUI.\n   See quotestar and quoteplus.  When the clipboard is not available or not\n   working, the unnamed register is used instead.  For Unix systems the clipboard\n   is only available when the +xterm_clipboard feature is present.  {not in Vi} Note that there is only a distinction between "* and "+ for X11 systems.:help x11-selection further clarifies the difference of * and +:There are three documented X selections: PRIMARY (which is expected to\n   represent the current visual selection - as in Vim\'s Visual mode), SECONDARY\n   (which is ill-defined) and CLIPBOARD (which is expected to be used for\n   cut, copy and paste operations).Of these three, Vim uses PRIMARY when reading and writing the "* register\n   (hence when the X11 selections are available, Vim sets a default value for\n   \'clipboard\' of "autoselect"), and CLIPBOARD when reading and writing the "+\n   register.  Vim does not access the SECONDARY selection.Examples: (assuming the default option values)Select an URL in Visual mode in Vim.  Go to your browser and click the\n  middle mouse button in the URL text field.  The selected text will be\n  inserted (hopefully!).  Note: in Firefox you can set the\n  middlemouse.contentLoadURL preference to true in about:config, then the\n  selected URL will be used when pressing middle mouse button in most places in the window.Select some text in your browser by dragging with the mouse.  Go to Vim and\n  press the middle mouse button: The selected text is inserted.Another way to paste is via <CR> and dropping the contents of the register (here the global register). See: :h i_ctrl-r and h i_CTRL-R_CTRL-O.  From the vim help documentation:\nInsert the contents of a register literally and don\'t auto-indent. Does the same as pasting with the mouse<MiddleMouse>. Does not replace characters! The \'.\' register (last inserted text) is still inserted as typed.{not in Vi}So to paste contents into vim without auto indent, use <CR><CO>* in most unix systems.   Note: this only works if vim is compiled with clipboard.Sadly I found the vim plugin mentioned not to be working with iTerm2 3.0.15 (to be fair I don\'t know if this broke on older versions) - but I found this hack instead.Map command-p to do the paste and using iTerm2 vim keys. Obviously this only works for iTerm2.How it works. I use "jk" to enter escape mode so you will also need::inoremap jk in your .vimrc.Then it just invokes P to enter paste mode, "+p to paste from the clipboard and then P to disable paste mode. hth.
