I\'ve come across at least three ways to print to stderr:It seems to contradict zen of Python #13 \xe2\x80\xa0, so what\'s the preferred way to do it? Are there any advantages or disadvantages to one way or the other?\xe2\x80\xa0 There should be one \xe2\x80\x94 and preferably only one \xe2\x80\x94 obvious way to do it.I found this to be the only one short + flexible + portable + readable:The function eprint can be used in the same was as the standard print function:sys.stderr.write() is my choice, just more readable and saying exactly what you intend to do and portable across versions.  Edit: being \'pythonic\' is a third thought to me over readability and performance... with these two things in mind, with python 80% of your code will be pythonic. list comprehension being the \'big thing\' that isn\'t used as often (readability).For Python 2 my choice is:\nprint >> sys.stderr, \'spam\'\nBecause you can simply print lists/dicts etc. without convert it to string. \nprint >> sys.stderr, {\'spam\': \'spam\'}\ninstead of:\nsys.stderr.write(str({\'spam\': \'spam\'}))print >> sys.stderr is gone in Python3.\nhttp://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html says:Unfortunately, this is quite ugly. Alternatively, usebut note that write is not a 1:1 replacement for print.I would say that your first approach:is the "One . . . obvious way to do it"  The others don\'t satisfy rule #1 ("Beautiful is better than ugly.")I did the following using Python 3:So now I\'m able to add keyword arguments, for example, to avoid carriage return:This will mimic the standard print function but output on stderrEDIT In hind-sight, I think the potential confusion with changing sys.stderr and not seeing the behaviour updated makes this answer not as good as just using a simple function as others have pointed out.Using partial only saves you 1 line of code. The potential confusion is not worth saving 1 line of code.originalTo make it even easier, here\'s a version that uses \'partial\', which is a big help in wrapping functions.You then use it like soYou can check that it\'s printing to stderr and not stdout by doing the following (over-riding code from http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com.au/2009/05/python-redirect-or-turn-off-stdout-and.html):The downside to this is partial assigns the value of sys.stderr to the wrapped function at the time of creation. Which means, if you redirect stderr later it won\'t affect this function.\nIf you plan to redirect stderr, then use the **kwargs method mentioned by aaguirre on this page.Nobody\'s mentioned logging yet, but logging was created specifically to communicate error messages. By default it is set up to write to stderr. This script:has the following result when run on the command line:(and bar.txt contains the \'hello world\')The same applies to stdout:As stated in the other answers, print offers a pretty interface that is often more convenient (e.g. for printing debug information), while write is faster and can also be more convenient when you have to format the output exactly in certain way. I would consider maintainability as well:You may later decide to switch between stdout/stderr and a regular file.print() syntax has changed in Python 3, so if you need to support both versions, write() might be better.I am working in python 3.4.3.  I am cutting out a little typing that shows how I got here:Did it work?  Try redirecting stderr to a file and see what happens:Well, aside from the fact that the little introduction that python gives you has been slurped into stderr (where else would it go?), it works.If you do a simple test:You will find that sys.stderr.write() is consistently 1.81 times faster!
