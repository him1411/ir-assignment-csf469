The new keyword in JavaScript can be quite confusing when it is first encountered, as people tend to think that JavaScript is not an object-oriented programming language.It does 5 things:Note: constructor function refers the function after the new keyword, as in Once this is done, if an undefined property of the new object is requested, the script will check the object\'s [[prototype]] object for the property instead. This is how you can get something similar to traditional class inheritance in JavaScript. The most difficult part about this is point number 2.  Every object (including functions) has this internal property called [[prototype]]. It can only be set at object creation time, either with new, with Object.create, or based on the literal (functions default to Function.prototype, numbers to Number.prototype, etc.). It can only be read with Object.getPrototypeOf(someObject). There is no other way to set or read this value.Functions, in addition to the hidden [[prototype]] property, also have a property called prototype, and it is this that you can access, and modify, to provide inherited properties and methods for the objects you make.Here is an example:It\'s like class inheritance because now, any objects you make using new ObjMaker() will also appear to have inherited the \'b\' property.If you want something like a subclass, then you do this:I read a ton of rubbish on this subject before finally finding this page, where this is explained very well with nice diagrams.Suppose you have this function:If you call this as a standalone function like so:Executing this function will add two properties to the window object (A and B). It adds it to the window because window is the object that called the function when you execute it like that, and this in a function is the object that called the function. In Javascript at least. Now, call it like this with new:What happens when you add new to a function call is that a new object is created (just var bar = new Object()) and that the this within the function points to the new Object you just created, instead of to the object that called the function. So bar is now an object with the properties A and B. Any function can be a constructor, it just doesn\'t always make sense. In addition to Daniel Howard\'s answer, here is what new does (or at least seems to do):Whileis equivalent totry out the following code in console.Now you can read the community wiki answer :)so it\'s probably not for creating\n  instances of objectIt\'s used exactly for that. You define a function constructor like so:However the extra benefit that ECMAScript has is you can extend with the .prototype property, so we can do something like...All objects created from this constructor will now have a getName because of the prototype chain that they have access to.JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language and it\'s used exactly for creating instances. It\'s prototype-based, rather than class-based, but that does not mean that it is not object-oriented.Javascript is a dynamic programming language which supports the object oriented programming paradigm, and it use used for creating new instances of object.Classes are not necessary for objects - Javascript is a prototype based language.sometimes code is easier than words:for me, as long as I not prototype, I use style of func2 as it gives me a bit more flexibility inside and outside the function.The new keyword is for creating new object instances. And yes, javascript is a dynamic programming language, which supports the object oriented programming paradigm. The convention about the object naming is, always use capital letter for objects that are supposed to be instantiated by the new keyword.Well JavaScript per si can differ greatly from platform to platform as it is always an implementation of the original specification EcmaScript.In any case, independently of the implementation all JavaScript implementations that follow the EcmaScript specification right, will give you an Object Oriented Language. According to the ES standard:ECMAScript  is  an  object-oriented  programming  language  for \n  performing  computations and  manipulating computational  objects \n  within  a  host  environment.So now that we have agreed that JavaScript is an implementation of EcmaScript and therefore it is an object-oriented language. The definition of the new operation in any Object-oriented language, says that such keyword is used to create an object instance from a class of a certain type (including anonymous types, in cases like C#).In EcmaScript we don\'t use classes, as you can read from the specs:ECMAScript does not use classes such as those in C++, Smalltalk, or Java. Instead objects may be created in various ways including via\n  a literal notation or via constructors which create objects and then execute code that initializes all or part of them by assigning initial\n  values to their properties. Each constructor is a function that has a\n  property named \xe2\x80\x95\n      prototype \xe2\x80\x96 that is used to implement prototype - based inheritance and shared properties. Objects   are   created   by\n  using   constructors   in new expressions;   for   example, new\n  Date(2009,11) creates a new Date object. Invoking a constructor\n  without using new has consequences that depend  on  the  constructor. \n  For  example, Date() produces  a  string  representation  of  the \n  current  date  and time rather than an object.The new keyword creates instances of objects using functions as a constructor. For instance:Instances inherit from the prototype of the constructor function. So given the example above...
