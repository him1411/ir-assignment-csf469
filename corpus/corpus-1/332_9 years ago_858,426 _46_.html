I need to add a specific column if it is does not exist. I have something like this, but it always returns false:How can I check if a column exists in a table of SQL Server database?SQL Server 2005 onwards:Martin Smith\'s version is shorter:A more concise versionThe point about permissions on viewing metadata applies to all answers not just this one.Note that the first parameter table name to COL_LENGTH can be in one, two, or three part name format as required. An example referencing a table in a different database isOne difference with this answer compared to using the metadata views is that metadata functions such as COL_LENGTH always only return data about committed changes irrespective of the isolation level in effect.Tweak the below to suit your specific requirements:Edit to deal with edit to question: That should work - take a careful look over your code for stupid mistakes; are you querying INFORMATION_SCHEMA on the same database as your insert is being applied to for example? Do you have a typo in your table/column name in either statement?Try this...I\'d prefer INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS over a system table because Microsoft does not guarantee to preserve the system tables between versions. For example, dbo.syscolumns does still work in SQL 2008, but it\'s deprecated and could be removed at any time in future.You can use the information schema system views to find out pretty much anything about the tables you\'re interested in:You can also interrogate views, stored procedures and pretty much anything about the database using the Information_schema views.Try something like:Then use it like this:It should work on both SQL Server 2000 & SQL Server 2005. Not sure about SQL Server 2008, but don\'t see why not.First check if the table/column(id/name) combination exists in dbo.syscolumns (an internal SQL Server table that contains field definitions), and if not issue the appropriate ALTER TABLE query to add it. For example:A good friend and colleague of mine showed me how you can also use an IF block with SQL functions OBJECT_ID and COLUMNPROPERTY in SQL SERVER 2005+ to check for a column. You can use something similar to the following:You can see for yourself hereFor the people who is checking the column existence to drop it.In SQL Server 2016 you can use new DIE statements instead of big IF wrappersTry thisThis worked for me in SQL 2000:I needed similar for SQL SERVER 2000 and, as @Mitch points out, this only works inm 2005+.Should it help anyone else, this is what worked for me in the end:A temp table version of the accepted answer:Wheat\'s answer is good, but assumes you do not have any identical table name / column name pairs in any schema or database.  To make it safe for that condition use this...One of the most simple and understandable solution is:There are several ways to check the existence of a column. \nI would strongly recommend to use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS as it is created in order to communicate with user.\nConsider following tables:and even some other access methods available to check system catalog.Also, no need to use SELECT *, simply test it by NULL valueSimple Script i use to Manage addition of Columns in the database like this :Here Name is the ColumnName need to be added .While Object is the Table NameYet another variation...The commercial product I am working with uses a query similar to the one below, checking for the existence of all the required columns at once. The query and in particular the list of columns is created in the software.The query is presented to the server via software and an ODBC link to the database and is run for our C++ program within a try-catch exception handler.If the query runs okay, the columns exist.\nIf the query fails, then further queries are executed and the missing columns created etc, so that our software always has the tables and columns it needs to run correctly. Older databases are updated to add the columns they are missing.The solution differs from many solutions above since it is running from software and it can handle database servers which predate certain SQL server systems tables and functions like INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS, sys.columns and object_id() some of which are vendor specific anyway and do not provide a general solution across Microsoft SQL server and Adobe MySQL products etc.If your queries are run by your own software and an ODBC connection to the SQL Server, and you want them to run with databases other than SQL Server too, then this approach might be worth consideration.This post has been down-voted numerous times. I know its not a solution for most people since it is for integration within software,  and I know it\'s not fashionable to provide something that works with legacy systems rather than assuming and relying on up to date technology. The try-catch idea is ugly and \nthe use of WHERE ID=NULL to return a single value regardless of actual table contents is not straight forward either. But despite the down votes I am leaving this here in case it helps someone.Use this query:This way you can use the conditions in SQL.Hope it helps.I would best go for
