I\'ve got an array:I\'m unable to change the structure of the array. I\'m being passed an id of 45, and I want to get \'bar\' for that object in the array. How do I do this in JavaScript or using jQuery?As you are already using jQuery, you can use the grep function which is intended for searching an array:The result is an array with the items found. If you know that the object is always there and that it only occurs once, you can just use result[0].foo to get the value. Otherwise you should check the length of the resulting array. Example:Another solution is to create a lookup object:This is especially interesting if you need to do many lookups.This won\'t need much more memory since the IDs and objects will be shared.From MDN:The find() method returns a value in the array, if an element in the array satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise undefined is returned.If you want to get array of matching elements, use filter() method instead:This will return array of objects. If you want to get array of foo properties, you can do this with map() method:Side note: methods like find() or filter(), and arrow functions are not supported by older browsers (e.g. IE 11), so if you want to support these browsers, you should transpile your code using Babel.Underscore.js has a nice method for that:I think the easiest way would be the following, but it won\'t work on Internet Explorer 8 (or earlier):ECMAScript 2015 provides the find() method on arrays: It works without external libraries. But if you want older browser support you might want to include this polyfill.Try the followingA generic and more flexible version of the findById function above:You can use filters,You can get this easily using the map() function:Working example: http://jsfiddle.net/hunter/Pxaua/returns the object element if found, otherwise falseWhile there are many correct answers here, many of them do not address the fact that this is an unnecessarily expensive operation if done more than once. In an extreme case this could be the cause of real performance problems.In the real world, if you are processing a lot of items and performance is a concern it\'s much faster to initially build a lookup:you can then get at items in fixed time like this : You might also consider using a Map instead of an object as the lookup: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/MapYou may try out Sugarjs from http://sugarjs.com/.It has a very sweet method on Arrays, .find. So you can find an element like this:You may also pass an object with more properties to it to add another "where-clause".Note that Sugarjs extends native objects, and some people consider this very evil...You can do this even in pure JavaScript by using the in built "filter" function for arrays:So now simply pass "id" in place of key and "45" in place of value, and you will get the full object matching an id of 45. So that would be,Here\'s how I\'d go about it in pure JavaScript, in the most minimal manner I can think of that works in ECMAScript 3 or later. It returns as soon as a match is found.Building on the accepted answer:jQuery:Or CoffeeScript:I really liked the answer provided by Aaron Digulla but needed to keep my array of objects so I could iterate through it later.  So I modified it to Iterate over any item in the array. For every item you visit, check that item\'s id. If it\'s a match, return it.If you just want teh codez:And the same thing using ECMAScript 5\'s Array methods:Use:It should return an object by id.As long as the browser supports ECMA-262, 5th edition (December 2009), this should work, almost one-liner:This solution may helpful as well:I made it just like $.grep and if one object is find out, function will return the object, rather than an array.Use Array.prototype.filter() function.DEMO: https://jsfiddle.net/sumitridhal/r0cz0w5o/4/JSONFILTERIf you do this multiple times, you may set up a Map (ES6):Then you can simply do:Starting from aggaton\'s answer, this is a function that actually returns the wanted element (or null if not found), given the array and a callback function that returns a truthy value for the "correct" element:Just remember that this doesn\'t natively work on IE8-, as it doesn\'t support some. A polyfill can be provided, alternatively there\'s always the classic for loop:It\'s actually faster and more compact. But if you don\'t want to reinvent the wheel, I suggest using an utility library like underscore or lodash.Consider "axesOptions" to be array of objects with an object format being\n{:field_type => 2, :fields => [1,3,4]}Shortest,My way to find index of array:Use the filter method of jQuery:That will return the first element with the specified Id. It also has the benefit of a nice C# LINQ looking format.
