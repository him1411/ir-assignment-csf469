What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?UNION removes duplicate records (where all columns in the results are the same), UNION ALL does not.There is a performance hit when using UNION vs UNION ALL, since the database server must do additional work to remove the duplicate rows, but usually you do not want the duplicates (especially when developing reports).Result: Result:Both UNION and UNION ALL concatenate the result of two different SQLs. They differ in the way they handle duplicates.UNION performs a DISTINCT on the result set, eliminating any duplicate rows.UNION ALL does not remove duplicates, and it therefore faster than UNION.Note: While using this commands all selected columns need to be of the same data type.  Example: If we have two tables, 1) Employee and 2) CustomerUNION removes duplicates, whereas UNION ALL does not.In order to remove duplicates the result set must be sorted, and this may have an impact on the performance of the UNION, depending on the volume of data being sorted, and the settings of various RDBMS parameters ( For Oracle PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET with WORKAREA_SIZE_POLICY=AUTO or SORT_AREA_SIZE and SOR_AREA_RETAINED_SIZE if WORKAREA_SIZE_POLICY=MANUAL ).Basically, the sort is faster if it can be carried out in memory, but the same caveat about the volume of data applies.Of course, if you need data returned without duplicates then you must use UNION, depending on the source of your data.I would have commented on the first post to qualify the "is much less performant" comment, but have insufficient reputation (points) to do so.In ORACLE: UNION does not support BLOB (or CLOB) column types, UNION ALL does.The basic difference between UNION and UNION ALL is union operation eliminates the duplicated rows from the result set but union all returns all rows after joining.from http://zengin.wordpress.com/2007/07/31/union-vs-union-all/You can avoid duplicates and still run much faster than UNION DISTINCT (which is actually same as UNION) by running query like this:SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE a=X UNION ALL SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE b=Y AND a!=XNotice the AND a!=X part. This is much faster then UNION.Just to add my two cents to the discussion here: one could understand the UNION operator as a pure, SET-oriented UNION - e.g. set A={2,4,6,8}, set B={1,2,3,4}, A UNION B = {1,2,3,4,6,8}When dealing with sets, you would not want numbers 2 and 4 appearing twice, as an element either is or is not in a set.In the world of SQL, though, you might want to see all the elements from the two sets together in one "bag" {2,4,6,8,1,2,3,4}. And for this purpose T-SQL offers the operator UNION ALL.UNION\nThe UNION command is used to select related information from two tables, much like the JOIN command. However, when using the UNION command all selected columns need to be of the same data type. With UNION, only distinct values are selected.UNION ALL\nThe UNION ALL command is equal to the UNION command, except that UNION ALL selects all values.The difference between Union and Union all is that Union all will not eliminate duplicate rows, instead it just pulls all rows from all tables fitting your query specifics and combines them into a table.A UNION statement effectively does a SELECT DISTINCT on the results set. If you know that all the records returned are unique from your union, use UNION ALL instead, it gives faster results.(From Microsoft SQL Server Book Online)UNION [ALL] Specifies that multiple result sets are to be combined and returned as a single result set.ALL Incorporates all rows into the results. This includes duplicates. If not specified, duplicate rows are removed.UNION will take too long as a duplicate rows finding like DISTINCT is applied on the results.is equivalent of:A side effect of applying DISTINCT over results is a sorting operation on results.UNION ALL results will be shown as arbitrary order on results But UNION results will be shown as ORDER BY 1, 2, 3, ..., n (n = column number of Tables) applied on results. You can see this side effect when you don\'t have any duplicate row.Not sure that it matters which databaseUNION and UNION ALL should work on all SQL Servers.You should avoid of unnecessary UNIONs they are huge performance leak. As a rule of thumb use UNION ALL if you are not sure which to use.union is used to select distinct values from two tables \nwhere as union all is used to select all values including \nduplicates from the tablesUNION - results in distinct records  while  \nUNION ALL - results in all the records including duplicates.Both are blocking operators and hence I personally prefer using JOINS over Blocking Operators(UNION, INTERSECT, UNION ALL etc. ) anytime.To illustrate why Union operation performs poorly in comparison to Union All checkout the following example.Following are results of UNION ALL and UNION operations.A UNION statement effectively does a SELECT DISTINCT on the results set. If you know that all the records returned are unique from your union, use UNION ALL instead, it gives faster results. Using UNION results in Distinct Sort operations in the Execution Plan. Proof to prove this statement is shown below:It is good to understand with a Venn diagramm. here is the link to the source. There is a good description.One more thing i would like to add-Union:- Result set is sorted in ascending order.Union All:- Result set is not sorted. two Query output just gets appended. UNION merges the contents of two structurally-compatible tables into a single combined table. The difference between UNION and UNION ALL is that UNION will omit duplicate records whereas UNION ALL will include duplicate records.Union Result set is sorted in ascending order whereas UNION ALL Result set is not sortedUNION performs a DISTINCT on its Result set so it will eliminate any duplicate rows. Whereas UNION ALL won\'t remove duplicates and therefore it is faster than UNION.*Note: The performance of UNION ALL will typically be better than UNION, since UNION requires the server to do the additional work of removing any duplicates. So, in cases where it is certain that there will not be any duplicates, or where having duplicates is not a problem, use of UNION ALL would be recommended for performance reasons.I add an example, UNION, it is merging with distinct --> slower, because it need comparing (In Oracle SQL developer, choose query, press F10 to see cost analysis).UNION ALL, it is merging without distinct --> faster.andUNION removes duplicate records in other hand UNION ALL does not. But one need to check the bulk of data that is going to be processed and the column and data type must be same.since union internally uses "distinct" behavior to select the rows hence it is more costly in terms of time and performance.\nlikethis gives me 2020 recordson other handgives me more than 17402 rowson precedence perspective both has same precedence. If there is no ORDER BY, a UNION ALL may bring rows back as it goes, whereas a UNION would make you wait until the very end of the query before giving you the whole result set at once. This can make a difference in a time-out situation - a UNION ALL keeps the connection alive, as it were.So if you have a time-out issue, and there\'s no sorting, and duplicates aren\'t an issue, UNION ALL may be rather helpful.Suppose that you have two table Teacher & StudentBoth have 4 Column with different Name like thisYou can apply UNION or UNION ALL for those two table which have same number of columns. But they have different name or data type.When you apply UNION operation on 2 tables, it neglects all duplicate entries(all columns value of row in a table is same of another table). Like thisthe result will beWhen you apply UNION ALL operation on 2 tables, it returns all entries with duplicate(if there is any difference between any column value of a row in 2 tables). Like thisOutput\nPerformance:Obviously UNION ALL performance is better that UNION as they do additional task to remove the duplicate values. You can check that from Execution Estimated Time by press ctrl+L at MSSQLUNION and UNION ALL used to combine two or more query results.  UNION command selects distinct and related information from two tables which will eliminates duplicate rows. On the other hand, UNION ALL command selects all the values from both the tables, which displays all rows.
