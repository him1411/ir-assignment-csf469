I read the Git manual, FAQ, Git - SVN crash course, etc. and they all explain this and that, but nowhere can you find a simple instruction like:SVN repository in: svn://myserver/path/to/svn/reposGit repository in: git://myserver/path/to/git/reposI don\'t expect it to be that simple, and I don\'t expect it to be a single command. But I do expect it not to try to explain anything - just to say what steps to take given this example.Magic:Git and SVN operate very differently.  You need to learn Git, and if you want to track changes from SVN upstream, you need to learn git-svn.  The git-svn man page has a good examples section:Create a users file (i.e. users.txt) for mapping SVN users to Git:You can use this one-liner to build a template from your existing SVN repository:SVN will stop if it finds a missing SVN user not in the file. But after that you can update the file and pick-up where you left off.Now pull the SVN data from the repository:This command will create a new Git repository in dest_dir-tmp and start pulling the SVN repository. Note that the "--stdlayout" flag implies you have the common "trunk/, branches/, tags/" SVN layout. If your layout differs, become familiar with --tags, --branches, --trunk options (in general git svn help).All common protocols are allowed: svn://, http://, https://. The URL should target the base repository, something like http://svn.mycompany.com/myrepo/repository. That must not include /trunk, /tag or /branches.Note that after executing this command it very often looks like the operation is "hanging/freezed", and it\'s quite normal that it can be stuck for a long time after initializing the new repository. Eventually you will then see log messages which indicates that it\'s migrating.Also note that if you omit the --no-metadata flag, Git will append information about the corresponding SVN revision to the commit message (i.e. git-svn-id: svn://svn.mycompany.com/myrepo/<branchname/trunk>@<RevisionNumber> <Repository UUID>)If a user name is not found, update your users.txt file then:You might have to repeat that last command several times, if you have a large project, until all of the Subversion commits have been fetched:When completed, Git will checkout the SVN trunk into a new branch. Any other branches are setup as remotes. You can view the other SVN branches with:If you want to keep other remote branches in your repository, you want to create a local branch for each one manually.  (Skip trunk/master.)  If you don\'t do this, the branches won\'t get cloned in the final step.Tags are imported as branches. You have to create a local branch, make a tag and delete the branch to have them as tags in Git. To do it with tag "v1":Clone your GIT-SVN repository into a clean Git repository:The local branches that you created earlier from remote branches will only have been copied as remote branches into the new cloned repository. (Skip trunk/master.) For each branch you want to keep:Finally, remove the remote from your clean Git repository that points to the now deleted temporary repository:Cleanly Migrate Your Subversion Repository To a Git Repository. First you have to create a file that maps your Subversion commit author names to Git commiters, say ~/authors.txt:Then you can download the Subversion data into a Git repository:If you\xe2\x80\x99re on a Mac, you can get git-svn from MacPorts by installing git-core +svn.If your subversion repository is on the same machine as your desired git repository,\nthen you can use this syntax for the init step, otherwise all the same:I used the svn2git script and works like a charm! https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2gitI suggest getting comfortable with Git before trying to use git-svn constantly, i.e. keeping SVN as the centralized repo and using Git locally.However, for a simple migration with all the history, here are the few simple steps:Initialize the local repo:Mark how far back you want to start importing revisions:(or just "git svn fetch" for all revs)Actually fetch everything since then:You can check the result of the import with Gitk. I\'m not sure if this works on Windows, it works on OSX and Linux:When you\'ve got your SVN repo cloned locally, you may want to push it to a centralized Git repo for easier collaboration.First create your empty remote repo (maybe on GitHub?):Then, optionally sync your main branch so the pull operation will automatically merge the remote master with your local master, when both contain new stuff:After that, you may be interested in trying out my very own git_remote_branch tool, which helps dealing with remote branches:First explanatory post: "Git remote branches"Follow-up for the most recent version: "Time to git collaborating with git_remote_branch"There is a new solution for smooth migration from Subversion to Git (or for using both simultaneously): SubGit (http://subgit.com/). I\'m working on this project myself. We use SubGit in our repositories - some of my teammates use Git and some Subversion and so far it works very well.To migrate from Subversion to Git with SubGit you need to run:After that you\'ll get Git repository in svn_repos/.git and may clone it, or just continue to use Subversion and this new Git repository together: SubGit will make sure that both are always kept in sync. In case your Subversion repository contains multiple projects, then multiple Git repositories will be created in svn_repos/git directory. To customize translation before running it do the following:With SubGit you may migrate to pure Git (not git-svn) and start using it while still keeping Subversion as long as you need it (for your already configured build tools, for instance).Hope this helps!See the official git-svn manpage.  In particular, look under "Basic Examples":Tracking and contributing to an entire Subversion-managed project (complete\n      with a trunk, tags and branches):Pro Git 8.2 explains it:\nhttp://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-GitIt\'s all.+ To update from SVN, a Git repository created by the first command.I used a way to migrate to Git instantly for a huge repository. \nOf course you need some preparation. \nBut you may don\'t stop development process, at all.Here is my way.My solution looks like:Migration takes a lot of time for a big SVN repository. \nBut updating of the completed migration just seconds.Of course I\'m using SubGit, mama.\ngit-svn makes me Blue Screen of Death. Just constantly.\nAnd git-svn is boring me with Git\'s "filename too long" fatal error.STEPS1. Download SubGit2. Prepare migrate and updating commands.Let\'s say we do it for Windows (it\'s trivial to port to Linux). \nIn a SubGit\'s installation bin directory (subgit-2.X.X\\bin), create two .bat files.Content of a file/command for the migration:The "start" command is optional here (Windows). It\'ll allow to see errors on start and left a shell opened after completion of the SubGit.You may add here additional parameters similar to git-svn.\nI\'m using only --default-domain myCompanyDomain.com to fix the domain of the email address of SVN authors. \nI have the standard SVN repository\'s structure (trunk/branches/tags) and we didn\'t have troubles with "authors mapping". So I\'m doing nothing any more.(If you want to migrate tags like branches or your SVN have multiple branches/tags folders you may consider to use the more verbose SubGit approach)Tip 1: Use --minimal-revision YourSvnRevNumber to see fast how things boils out (some kind of a debugging).\nEspecially useful is to see resolved author names or emails. \nOr to limit the migration history depth.Tip 2: Migration may be interrupted (Ctrl + C) and restored by running of the next updating command/file. \nI don\'t advise doing this for big repositories. I have received "Out of memory Java+Windows exception".Tip 3: Better to create a copy of your result bare repository.Content of a file/command for updating:You may run it any amount of times when you want to obtain the last team\'s commits to your Git repository.Warning! Don\'t touch your bare repository (creation of branches for example). \nYou\'ll take the next fatal error:Unrecoverable error: are out of sync and cannot be synced ... Translating Subversion revisions to Git commits...3. Run the first command/file. It\'ll take a loooong time for a big repository. 30 hours for my humble repository.It\'s all. \nYou may update your Git repository from SVN at any time any amount of times by running the second file/command. And before switching of your development team to Git. \nIt\'ll take just seconds.There\'s one more useful task.Push your local Git repository to a remote Git repositoryIs it your case? Let\'s proceed.Run:By default your Git can\'t send big chunks.\nfatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedlyLet\'s run for it:524288000 - 500 MB\n1073741824 - 1 GB, etc.Fix your local certificate troubles.

For me the full recreation of my repository solves this error (30 hours). You can try the next commandsOr try to reinstall Git (useless for me).\nOr you may create branches from all you tags and push them. Or, or, or...This guide on atlassian\'s website is one of the best I have found:https://www.atlassian.com/git/migrationThis tool - https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/svn-migration-scripts - is also really useful for generating your authors.txt among other things.For complicated cases, reposurgeon by Eric S. Raymond is the tool of choice. In addition to SVN, it supports many other version control systems via the fast-export format, and also CVS. The author reports successful conversions of ancient repositories such as Emacs and FreeBSD.The tool apparently aims at near perfect conversion (such as converting SVN\'s svn:ignore properties to .gitignore files) even for difficult repository layouts with a long history. For many cases, other tools might be easier to use.Before delving into the documentation of the reposurgeon command line, be sure to read the excellent DVCS migration guide which goes over the conversion process step by step.A somewhat extended answer using just git, SVN, and bash. It includes steps for SVN repositories that do not use the conventional layout with a trunk/branches/tags directory layout (SVN does absolutely nothing to enforce this kind of layout).First use this bash script to scan your SVN repo for the different people who contributed and to generate a template for a mapping file:Use this to create an authors file where you map svn usernames to usernames and email as set by your developers using git config properties user.name and user.email (note that for a service like GitHub only having a matching email is enough).Then have git svn clone the svn repository to a git repository, telling it about the mapping:git svn clone --authors-file=authors --stdlayout svn://example.org/Folder/projectrootThis can take incredibly long, since git svn will individually check out every revision for every tag or branch that exists. (note that tags in SVN are just really branches, so they end up as such in Git). You can speed this up by removing old tags and branches in SVN you don\'t need. Running this on a server in the same network or on the same server can also really speed this up. Also, if for some reason this process gets interrupted  you can resume it usinggit svn rebase --continueIn a lot of cases you\'re done here. But if your SVN repo has an unconventional layout where you simply have a directory in SVN you want to put in a git branch you can do some extra steps.The simplest is to just make a new SVN repo on your server that does follow convention and use svn copy to put your directory in trunk or a branch. This might be the only way if your directory is all the way at the root of the repo, when I last tried this git svn simply refused to do a checkout.You can also do this using git. For git svn clone simply use the directory you want to to put in a git branch.After runNote that this required Git 1.7 or higher.You have to InstallCopied from this link http://john.albin.net/git/convert-subversion-to-git.1. Retrieve a list of all Subversion committersSubversion simply lists the username for each commit. Git\xe2\x80\x99s commits have much richer data, but at its simplest, the commit author needs to have a name and email listed. By default the git-svn tool will just list the SVN username in both the author and email fields. But with a little bit of work, you can create a list of all SVN users and what their corresponding Git name and emails are. This list can be used by git-svn to transform plain svn usernames into proper Git committers.From the root of your local Subversion checkout, run this command:That will grab all the log messages, pluck out the usernames, eliminate any duplicate usernames, sort the usernames and place them into a \xe2\x80\x9cauthors-transform.txt\xe2\x80\x9d file. Now edit each line in the file. For example, convert:into this:2. Clone the Subversion repository using git-svnThis will do the standard git-svn transformation (using the authors-transform.txt file you created in step 1) and place the git repository in the \xe2\x80\x9c~/temp\xe2\x80\x9d folder inside your home directory.3. Convert svn:ignore properties to .gitignoreIf your svn repo was using svn:ignore properties, you can easily convert this to a .gitignore file using:4. Push repository to a bare git repositoryFirst, create a bare repository and make its default branch match svn\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctrunk\xe2\x80\x9d branch name.Then push the temp repository to the new bare repository.You can now safely delete the ~/temp repository.5. Rename \xe2\x80\x9ctrunk\xe2\x80\x9d branch to \xe2\x80\x9cmaster\xe2\x80\x9dYour main development branch will be named \xe2\x80\x9ctrunk\xe2\x80\x9d which matches the name it was in Subversion. You\xe2\x80\x99ll want to rename it to Git\xe2\x80\x99s standard \xe2\x80\x9cmaster\xe2\x80\x9d branch using:6. Clean up branches and tagsgit-svn makes all of Subversions tags into very-short branches in Git of the form \xe2\x80\x9ctags/name\xe2\x80\x9d. You\xe2\x80\x99ll want to convert all those branches into actual Git tags using:This step will take a bit of typing. :-) But, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry; your unix shell will provide a > secondary prompt for the extra-long command that starts with git for-each-ref.GitHub now has a feature to import from an SVN repository. I never tried it, though.TortoiseGit does this. see this blog post: http://jimmykeen.net/articles/03-nov-2012/how-migrate-from-svn-to-git-windows-using-tortoise-clientsYeah, I know answering with links isn\'t splendid but it\'s a solution, eh?We can use git svn clone commands as below.Above command will create authors file from SVN commits.Above command will give you first revision number when your SVN project got created.Above command will create the Git repository in local.Problem is that it won\'t convert branches and tags to push. You will have to do them manually. For example below for branches:For tags:Now push master, branches and tags to remote git repository.svn2git utility removes manual efforts with branches and tags.Install it using command sudo gem install svn2git. After that run below command.Now you can list the branches, tags and push them easily.Imagine you have 20 branches and tags, obviously svn2git will save you a lot of time and that\'s why I like it better than native commands. It\'s a nice wrapper around native git svn clone command. For a complete example, refer my blog entry.I\'ve posted an step by step guide (here) to convert svn in to git including converting svn tags in to git tags and svn branches in to git branches.Short version:1) clone svn from an specific revision number. (the revision number must be the oldest you want to migrate)2) fetch svn data. This step it\'s the one it takes most time.repeat git svn fetch until finishes without error3) get master branch updated4) Create local branches from svn branches by copying references5) convert svn tags into git tags6) Put a repository at a better place like githubIf you want more details, read my post or ask me.I highly recommend this short series of screencasts I just discovered. The author walks you through the basic operations, and showcases some more advanced usages.If you are using SourceTree you can do this directly from the app. Goto File -> New/Clone then do the following: Open the repo in SourceTree and you\'ll see your commit messages have been migrated too.Now go to Repository -> Repository Settings and add the new remote repo details. Delete the SVN remote if you wish (I did this through the "Edit Config File" option.Push the code to the new remote repo when you are ready and code freely.As another aside, the git-stash command is a godsend when trying to git with git-svn dcommits.A typical process:The solution (requires git 1.5.3+):  Here is a simple shell script with no dependencies that will convert one or more SVN repositories to git and push them to GitHub.https://gist.github.com/NathanSweet/7327535In about 30 lines of script it: clones using git SVN, creates a .gitignore file from SVN::ignore properties, pushes into a bare git repository, renames SVN trunk to master, converts SVN tags to git tags, and pushes it to GitHub while preserving the tags.I went thru a lot of pain to move a dozen SVN repositories from Google Code to GitHub. It didn\'t help that I used Windows. Ruby was all kinds of broken on my old Debian box and getting it working on Windows was a joke. Other solutions failed to work with Cygwin paths. Even once I got something working, I couldn\'t figure out how to get the tags to show up on GitHub (the secret is --follow-tags).In the end I cobbled together two short and simple scripts, linked above, and it works great. The solution does not need to be any more complicated than that!For GitLab users I\'ve put up a gist on how I migrated from SVN here:https://gist.github.com/leftclickben/322b7a3042cbe97ed2afThat\'s it!  Reload the project page in GitLab web UI and you will see all commits and files now listed.I just wanted to add my contribution to the Git community. I wrote a simple bash script which automates the full import. Unlike other migration tools, this tool relies on native git instead of jGit. This tool also supports repositories with a large revision history and or large blobs. It\'s available via github:https://github.com/onepremise/SGMSThis script will convert projects stored in SVN with the following format:This scheme is also popular and supported as well:Each project will get synchronized over by project name:If you wish to convert the full repo over, use the following syntax:Effectively using Git with Subversion is a gentle introduction to git-svn. For existing SVN repositories, git-svn makes this super easy. If you\'re starting a new repository, it\'s vastly easier to first create an empty SVN repository and then import using git-svn than it is going in the opposite direction. Creating a new Git repository then importing into SVN can be done, but it is a bit painful, especially if you\'re new to Git and hope to preserve the commit history.Download the Ruby installer for Windows and install the latest version with it. Add Ruby executables to your path.Then type \xe2\x80\x9cgem install svn2git\xe2\x80\x9d and enterMigrate Subversion repositoryOpen a Ruby command prompt and go to the directory where the files are to be migratedThen svn2git http://[domain name]/svn/ [repository root]It may take few hours to migrate the project to Git depends on the project code size.This major step helps in creating the Git repository structure as mentioned below.SVN (/Project_components) trunk     -->      Git master\nSVN (/Project_components) branches  -->  Git branches\nSVN (/Project_components) tags      -->      Git tagsCreate the remote repository and push the changes.GitHub has an importer. Once you\'ve created the repository, you can import from an existing repository, via its URL. It will ask for your credentials if applicable and go from there.As it\'s running it will find authors, and you can simply map them to users on GitHub.I have used it for a few repositories now, and it\'s pretty accurate and much faster too! It took 10 minutes for a repository with ~4000 commits, and after it took my friend four days!Several answers here refer to https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git, but for large repositories this can be slow. I had a try using https://github.com/svn-all-fast-export/svn2git instead which is a tool with exactly the same name but was used to migrate KDE from SVN to Git.Slightly more work to set it up but when done the conversion itself for me took minutes where the other script spent hours.There are different methods to achieve this goal. I\'ve tried some of them and found really working one with just git and svn installed on Windows OS.Prerequisites: Steps to achieve final goal (move all repository with history to a git, firstly local git, then remote)Create empty repository (using console tools or tortoiseSVN) in directory REPO_NAME_FOLDER\ncd REPO_NAME_PARENT_FOLDER, put dumpfile.dump into REPO_NAME_PARENT_FOLDERsvnadmin load REPO_NAME_FOLDER < dumpfile.dump Wait for this operation, it may be longThis command is silent, so open second cmd window : svnserve -d -R --root REPO_NAME_FOLDER \nWhy not just use file:///...... ?

If yes - okaySo now you have fully functional local git repository with your sources and old svn history.\nNow, if you want to move it to some server, use the following commands : In my case, I\'ve dont need tags command cause my repo dont have tags.Good luck!Converting svn submodule/folder \'MyModule\' into git with history without tags nor branches.To retain svn ignore list use the above comments after step 1I used the following script to read a text file that has a list of all my SVN repos and convert them to GIT, and later use git clone --bare to convert to a bare git repolist.txt has the formatand users.txt has the format(no author) = Prince Rogers <prince.rogers.nelson@payesley.park.org>www-data  is the Apache web server user, permission is needed to push changes over HTTP
