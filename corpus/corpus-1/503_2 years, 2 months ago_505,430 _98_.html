What setting do I need to put in my info.plist to enable HTTP mode as per the following error message?Transport security has blocked a cleartext HTTP (http://) resource\n  load since it is insecure. Temporary exceptions can be configured via\n  your app\'s Info.plist file.Assume that my domain is example.com.If you are using Xcode 8.0 and Swift 3.0 or Swift 2.2:Use:You have to set the NSAllowsArbitraryLoads key to YES under NSAppTransportSecurity dictionary in your .plist file.Here are the settings visually:See the forum post Application Transport Security?.Also the page Configuring App Transport Security Exceptions in iOS 9 and OSX 10.11.For example, you can add a specific domain like:The lazy option is:info.plist is an XML file so you can place this code more or less anywhere inside the file.This was tested and was working on iOS 9 GM seed - this is the configuration to allow a specific domain to use HTTP instead of HTTPS:NSAllowsArbitraryLoads must be false, because it disallows all insecure connection, but the exceptions list allows connection to some domains without HTTPS.This is a quick workaround (but not recommended) to add this in the plist:Which means (according to Apple\'s documentation):NSAllowsArbitraryLoads \n  A Boolean value used to disable App Transport Security for any domains not listed in the NSExceptionDomains dictionary. Listed domains use the settings specified for that domain.The default value of NO requires the default App Transport Security behaviour for all connections.I really recommend links:which help me understand reasons and all the implications.The XML (in file Info.plist) below will:disallow arbitrary calls for all pages, but for PAGE_FOR_WHICH_SETTINGS_YOU_WANT_TO_OVERRIDE will allow that connections use the HTTP protocol.To the XML above you can add:if you want to allow insecure connections for the subdomains of the specified address.The best approach is to block all arbitrary loads (set to false) and add exceptions to allow only addresses we know are fine.For interested readersFor those of you who want a more context on why this is happening, in addition to how to fix it, then read below.With the introduction of iOS 9, to improve the security of connections between an app and web services, secure connections between an app and its web service must follow best practices. The best practices behavior is enforced by the App Transport Security to:As explained in the App Transport Security Technote, when communicating with your web service, App Transport Security now has the following requirements and behavior:In other words, your web service request should: a.) use HTTPS and b.) be encrypted using TLS v1.2 with forward secrecy.However, as was mentioned in other posts, you can override this new behavior from App Transport Security by specifying the insecure domain in the Info.plist of your app.To override, you will need to add the NSAppTransportSecurity > NSExceptionDomains dictionary properties to your Info.plist. Next, you will add your web service\'s domain to the NSExceptionDomains dictionary.For example, if I want to bypass the App Transport Security behavior for a web service on the host www.yourwebservicehost.com then I would do the following:Open your app in Xcode.Find the Info.plist file in Project Navigator and "right-mouse" click on it and choose the Open As > Source Code menu option. The property list file will appear in the right pane.Put the following properties block inside of the main properties dictionary (under the first <dict>).If you need to provide exceptions for additional domains then you would add another dictionary property beneath NSExceptionDomains.To find out more about the keys referenced above, read this already mentioned technote.I do not like editing the plist directly. You can easily add it to the plist using the GUI:Now change the data in the main area:There are two solutions for this :Solutions 1 : Plist structure should appear as shown in below image.Solution 2 :Plist structure should appear as shown in below image.Solution 2 is preferred since it allows only selected domain whereas solution 1 allows all insecure HTTP connections.Transport security is available on iOS 9.0 or later. You may have this warning when trying to call a WS inside your application:Application Transport Security has blocked a cleartext HTTP (http://) resource load since it is insecure. Temporary exceptions can be configured via your app\'s Info.plist file.Adding the following to your Info.plist will disable ATS:Figuring out what settings to use can be performed automatically, as mentioned in this technote:Here is a screenshot of a plist which keeps ATS intact (=secure), but allows that connections to localhost can be made via HTTP instead of HTTPS. It works in Xcode 7.1.1.Use:Add a new item, NSAppTransportSecurity, in the plist file with type Dictionary, then add sub item NSAllowsArbitraryLoads in dictionary of type Boolean, and set bool value YES. This works for me.On 2015-09-25 (after Xcode updates on 2015-09-18):I used a non-lazy method, but it didn\'t work. The followings are my tries.First,And second,Finally, I used the lazy method:It might be a little insecure, but I couldn\'t find other solutions.Go to your Info.plistNOTE: The exception domain in your plist should be in LOWER-CASE.  Example: you have named your machine "MyAwesomeMacbook" under Settings->Sharing; your server (for test purposes) is running on MyAwesomeMacbook.local:3000, and your app needs to send a request to http://MyAwesomeMacbook.local:3000/files..., your plist you will need to specify "myawesomemacbook.local" as the exception domain.--Your info.plist would contain...Update for Xcode 7.1, facing problem 27.10.15:The new value in the Info.plist is "App Transport Security Settings".\nFrom there, this dictionary should contain:It may be worth mentioning how to get there...Info.plist is one of the files below the Main.storyboard or viewController.swift.When you click on it the first time, it usually is in a table format, so right click the file and \'open as\' Source code and then add the code below towards the end, i.e.:Copy paste the code just abovewhich is at the end.According to Apple, generally disabling ATS will lead to app rejection, unless you have a good reason to do so. Even then, you should add exceptions for domains that you can access safely.Apple has an excellent tool that tells you exactly what settings to use: In Terminal, enterand nscurl will check whether this request fails, and then try a variety of settings and tell you exactly which one passes, and what to do. For example, for some third-party URL that I visit, this command told me that this dictionary passes:To distinguish between your own sites and third-party sites that are out of your control, use, for example, the key NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy.Add this code into the info.plist file:In Xcode 7 we need to do like this:In file Info.plist, add:For Cordova, if you want to add it into your ios.json, do the following:And it should be inside of:Using NSExceptionDomains may not apply an effect simultaneously due to target site may load resources (e.g. js files) from external domains over http. It can be resolved by adding these external domains to NSExceptionDomains as well.To inspect which resources cannot be loaded try to use Remote debugging. Here is a tutorial: http://geeklearning.io/apache-cordova-and-remote-debugging-on-ios/Like many have noted, this is a feature issue that comes with iOS 9.0. They have added a thing called App Transport Security, and I too was annoyed when it broke my Apps.You can bandage it with the NSAllowsArbitraryLoads key to YES under NSAppTransportSecurity dictionary in your .plist file, but ultimately you will need to re-write the code that forms your URLs to form the HTTPS:// prefix.Apple has re-written the NSUrlConnection class in iOS 9.0. You can read about it in NSURLConnection.Else, you may have to back out of iOS 9.0 until you have time to implement the correct solution.
