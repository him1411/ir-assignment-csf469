I want a 5 character string composed of characters picked randomly from the set [a-zA-Z0-9].What\'s the best way to do this with JavaScript?I think this will work for you:Math.random is bad for this kind of thingOption 1If you\'re able to do this server-side, just use the crypto moduleThe resulting string will be twice as long as the random bytes you generate; each byte encoded to hex is 2 characters. 20 bytes will be 40 characters of hex.Option 2If you have to do this client-side, perhaps try the uuid moduleOption 3If you have to do this client-side and you don\'t have to support old browsers, you can do it without dependenciesHere\'s an improvement on doubletap\'s excellent answer. The original has two drawbacks which are addressed here:First, as others have mentioned, it has a small probability of producing short strings or even an empty string (if the random number is 0), which may break your application. Here is a solution:Second, both the original and the solution above limit the string size N to 16 characters. The following will return a string of size N for any N (but note that using N > 16 will not increase the randomness or decrease the probability of collisions):Explanation:Further thoughts:Update:Here are a couple other functional-style one-liners I came up with. They differ from the solution above in that:So, say your alphabet of choice isThen these two are equivalent to each other, so you can pick whichever is more intuitive to you:andEdit:I seems like qubyte and Martijn de Milliano came up with solutions similar to the latter (kudos!), which I somehow missed. Since they don\'t look as short at a glance, I\'ll leave it here anyway in case someone really wants a one-liner :-)Also, replaced \'new Array\' with \'Array\' in all solutions to shave off a few more bytes.Short and easy + returns exactly 5 random characters, as opposed to some of the top rated answers found here.Something like this should workCall with default charset [a-zA-Z0-9] or send in your own:Have fun. jsBin demoWhile the above uses additional checks for the desired (A/N, A, N) output,\nlet\'s break it down the to the essentials (Alpha-Numeric only) for a better understanding:Let\'s picture the Character table and their ranges:Math.floor( Math.random * 62 ) gives a range from 0..61 (what we need). \nHow to fix (increment) the random to get the correct charCode ranges?The conditional operation logic from the table above:If you followed the above explanation you should be able to create this alpha-numeric snippet:jsBin demoOr if you will: The most compact solution, because slice is shorter than substring.  Subtracting from the end of the string allows to avoid floating point symbol generated by random function:or evenThe simplest way is: This generate random strings of 5 characters based on the current time. Example output is 4mtxj or 4mv90 or 4mwp1The problem with this is that if you call it two times on the same second, it will generate the same string. The safer way is: This will generate a random string of 4 or 5 characters, always diferent. Example output is like 30jzm or 1r591 or 4su1aIn both ways the first part generate a random number. The .toString(36) part cast the number to a base36 (alphadecimal) representation of it. Here are some easy one liners. Change new Array(5) to set the length.If you are using Lodash or Underscore, then it so simple:I know everyone has got it right already, but i felt like having a go at this one in the most lightweight way possible(light on code, not CPU):It takes a bit of time to wrap your head around, but I think it really shows how awesome javascript\'s syntax is.Here\'s the method I created.\nIt will create a string containing both uppercase and lowercase characters.\nIn addition I\'ve included the function that will created an alphanumeric string too.Working examples:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/greatbigmassive/vhsxs/  (alpha only)\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/greatbigmassive/PJwg8/ (alphanumeric)Upgrade July 2015\nThis does the same thing but makes more sense and includes all letters.In case anyone is interested in a one-liner (although not formatted as such for your convenience) that allocates the memory at once (but note that for small strings it really does not matter) here is how to do it:You can replace 5 by the length of the string you want. Thanks to @AriyaHidayat in this post for the solution to the map function not working on the sparse array created by Array(5).Assuming you use underscorejs it\'s possible to elegantly generate random string in just two lines:You can loop through an array of items and recursively add them to a string variable, for instance if you wanted a random DNA sequence:This is as clean as it will get. It is fast too, http://jsperf.com/ay-random-string.This works for sureGenerate 10 characters long string. Length is set by parameter (default 10).Here is a test script for the #1 answer (thank you @csharptest.net)the script runs makeid() 1 million times and as you can see 5 isnt a very unique. running it with a char length of 10 is quite reliable. I\'ve ran it about 50 times and haven\'t seen a duplicate yet :-) note: node stack size limit exceeds around 4 million so you cant run this 5 million times it wont ever finish.How about this compact little trick?You need the Array.apply there to trick the empty array into being an array of undefineds.If you\'re coding for ES2015, then building the array is a little simpler:Fast and improved algorithm. Does not guarantee uniform (see comments).Expanding on Doubletap\'s elegant example by answering the issues Gertas and Dragon brought up. Simply add in a while loop to test for those rare null circumstances, and limit the characters to five.  Here\'s a jsfiddle alerting you with a result: \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/pLJJ7/will generate a random alpha-numeric string with the length of the first/calling stringThis is what I used. A combination of a couple here. I use it in a loop, and each ID it produces is unique. It might not be 5 characters, but it\'s guaranteed unique.If a library is a possibility, Chance.js might be of help: http://chancejs.com/#stringI loved the brievety of doubletap\'s Math.random().toString(36).substring(7) answer, but not that it had so many collisions as hacklikecrack correctly pointed out.  It generated 11-chacter strings but has a duplicate rate of 11% in a sample size of 1 million.Here\'s a longer (but still short) and slower alternative that had only 133 duplicates in a sample space of 1 million.  In rare cases the string will still be shorter than 11 chars:A functional approach. This answer is only practical if the functional prerequisites can be leveraged in other parts of your app. The performance is probably junk, but it was super fun to write.In my opinion, it\'s hard to beat the clarity of idGenerator without adding magical, do-too-many-things functions.A slight improvement could beHave fun with it. Let me know what you like/learn ^_^You can use coderain. It\'s a library to generate random codes according to given pattern. Use # as a placeholder for upper and lowercase characters as well as digits:There are other placeholders like A for uppercase letters or 9 for digits.What may be useful is that calling .next() will always give you a unique result so you don\'t have to worry about duplicates.Here is a demo application that generates a list of unique random codes.Full disclosure: I\'m the author of coderain.
