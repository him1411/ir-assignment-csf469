I mean 100+ MB big; such text files can push the envelope of editors.I need to look through a large XML file, but cannot if the editor is buggy.Any suggestions?I\'m assuming that you\'re on Windows, so I\'ll recommend gVim (you need to be familiar with VI/ VIM commands to use it). Where Notepad++ (32 bit) will choke on very large files, Vim has chowed through those puppies with little problem.010Editor on Windows will open GIANT (think 5 GB) files in binary mode and allow you to edit and search the text.Community wiki:Suggestions are Text editors with a 2 GB limit: Notepad++ (32 bit), Jujuedit, and TextPad.Or, if you just want to peek at the start of the file, the Windows built-in more command might be good enough.Why are you using editors to just look at a (large) file?Under *nix or Cygwin, just use less ("less is more", only better, since you can back up). Searching and navigating under less is very similar to Vim, but there is no swap file and little RAM used.There is a native Win32 port of GNU "less". See the comment below.Piggybacking off of some of the comments below, Perl\'s ".." (range flip/flop) operator makes a nice selection mechanism to limit the crud you have to wade through, as well.For example:(start at line 1 million and stop at line 2 million, sift the output manually in "less")(start when the "interesting regular expression" finds something, stop when the "boring regular expression" find the end of an interesting block  --  may find multiple blocks, sift the output...)Finally, 100 MB isn\'t too big. 3 GB is getting kind of big. I used to work at a print & mail facility that created about 2 % of U.S. first class mail. One of the systems for which I was the tech lead accounted for about 15+ % of the pieces of mail. We had some big files to debug here and there.Community Wiki Suggestions:Use LogParser to look at the file:
