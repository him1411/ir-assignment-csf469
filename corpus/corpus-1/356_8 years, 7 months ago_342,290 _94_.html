What real (i.e. practical) difference exists between a static class and a singleton pattern?Both can be invoked without instantiation, both provide only one "Instance" and neither of them is thread-safe. Is there any other difference?What makes you say that either a singleton or a static method isn\'t thread-safe? Usually both should be implemented to be thread-safe.The big difference between a singleton and a bunch of static methods is that singletons can implement interfaces (or derive from useful base classes, although that\'s less common, in my experience), so you can pass around the singleton as if it were "just another" implementation.The true answer is by Jon Skeet, on another forum here.A singleton allows access to a single\n  created instance - that instance (or\n  rather, a reference to that instance)\n  can be passed as a parameter to other\n  methods, and treated as a normal\n  object.A static class allows only static\n  methods.The Singleton pattern has several advantages over static classes. First, a singleton can extend classes and implement interfaces, while a static class cannot (it can extend classes, but it does not inherit their instance members). A singleton can be initialized lazily or asynchronously while a static class is generally initialized when it is first loaded, leading to potential class loader issues. However the most important advantage, though, is that singletons can be handled polymorphically without forcing their users to assume that there is only one instance.static classes should not do anything need state, it is useful for putting bunch of functions together i.e Math (or Utils in projects). So the class name just give us a clue where we can find the functions and there\'s nothing more.Singleton is my favorite pattern and use it to manage something at a single point. It\'s more flexible than static classes and can maintain state. It can implement interfaces, inherit from other classes and allow inheritance.My rule for choosing between static and singleton:If there are bunch of functions should be kept together, then static is the choice.\nAnything else which needs single access to some resources, could be implemented singleton.A static class is one that has only static methods, for which a better word would be "functions". The design style embodied in a static class is purely procedural.Singleton, on the other hand, is a pattern specific to OO design. It is an instance of an object (with all the possibilities inherent in that, such as polymorphism), with a creation procedure that ensures that there is only ever one instance of that particular role over its entire lifetime.Static Class:-You cannot create the instance of static class.Loaded automatically by the .NET Framework common language runtime (CLR) when the program or namespace containing the class is loaded.Static Class cannot have constructor.We cannot pass the static class to method.We cannot inherit Static class to another Static class in C#.A class having all static methods.Better performance (static methods are bonded on compile time)Singleton:-You can create one instance of the object and reuse it.Singleton instance is created for the first time when the user requested. Singleton class can have constructor.You can create the object of singleton class and pass it to method.Singleton class does not say any restriction of Inheritance.We can dispose the objects of a singleton class but not of static class.Methods can be overridden.Can be lazy loaded when need (static classes are always loaded).We can implement interface(static class can not implement interface).In singleton pattern you can create the singleton as an instance of a derived type, you can\'t do that with a static class.Quick Example:To expand on Jon Skeet\'s AnswerThe big difference between a singleton and a bunch of static methods is that singletons can implement interfaces (or derive from useful base classes, although that\'s less common IME), so you can pass around the singleton as if it were "just another" implementation.Singletons are easier to work with when unit testing a class. Wherever you pass singletons as a parameter (constructors, setters or methods) you can instead substitute a mocked or stubbed version of the singleton.  Another advantage of a singleton is that it can easily be serialized, which may be necessary if you need to save its state to disc, or send it somewhere remotely.I\'m not a great OO theorist, but from what I know, I think the only OO feature that static classes lack compared to Singletons is polymorphism.\nBut if you don\'t need it, with a static class you can of course have inheritance ( not sure about interface implementation ) and data and function encapsulation.The comment of Morendil, "The design style embodied in a static class is purely procedural" I may be wrong, but I disagree.\nIn static methods you can access static members, which would be exactly the same as singleton methods accessing their single instance members.  edit:\nI\'m actually thinking now that another difference is that a Static class is instantiated at program start* and lives throughout the whole life span of the program, while a singleton is explicitly instantiated at some point and can be destroyed also.  * or it may be instantiated at first use, depending on the language, I think.To illustrate Jon\'s point what\'s shown below cannot be done if Logger was a static class.The class SomeClass expects an instance of ILogger implementation to be passed into its constructor. Singleton class is important for dependency injection to be possible.Here\'s a good article:\nhttp://javarevisited.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/difference-between-singleton-pattern-vs-static-class-java.htmlcan\'t override methods, but can use method hiding. (What is method hiding in Java? Even the JavaDoc explanation is confusing)In summary, I would only use static classes for holding util methods, and using Singleton for everything else.Editsstatic classes are lazy loaded as well. Thanks @jmoreno \n(When does static class initialization happen?)method hiding for static classes. Thanks @MaxPeng.Well a singleton is just a normal class that IS instantiated but just once and indirectly from the client code. Static class is not instantiated.\nAs far as I know static methods (static class must have static methods) are faster than non-static.   Edit:\nFxCop Performance rule description:\n"Methods which do not access instance data or call instance methods can be marked as static (Shared in VB). After doing so, the compiler will emit non-virtual call sites to these members which will prevent a check at runtime for each call that insures the current object pointer is non-null. This can result in a measurable performance gain for performance-sensitive code. In some cases, the failure to access the current object instance represents a correctness issue."\nI don\'t actually know if this applies also to static methods in static classes.Singleton\'s are instantiated, it\'s just there\'s only one instance ever instantiated, hence the single in Singleton.A static class can\'t be instantiated by anything other than itself.Singleton is better approach from testing perspective.\nUnlike static classes , singleton could implement interfaces and you can use mock instance and inject them.In the example below I will illustrate this.\nSuppose you have a method isGoodPrice() which uses a method getPrice() and you implement getPrice() as a method in a singleton.singleton that\xe2\x80\x99s provide getPrice functionality:Use of getPrice:Final Singleton implementation:test class:In case we take the alternative of using static method for implementing getPrice() , it was difficult to the mock getPrice().\nYou could mock static with power mock, yet not all product could use it.I\'m agree with this definition:The word "single" means single object across the application life\n  cycle, so the scope is at application level. The static does not have\n  any Object pointer, so the scope is at App Domain level. Moreover both should be implemented to be thread-safe.You can find interesting other differences about: Singleton Pattern Versus Static ClassWe have our DB framework that makes connections to Back end.To Avoid Dirty reads across Multiple users we have used singleton pattern to ensure we have single instance available at any point of time.In c# a static class cannot implement an interface. When a single instance class needs to implement an interface for a business contracts or IoC purposes, this is where I use the Singleton pattern without a static classSingleton provides a way to maintain state in stateless scenariosHope that helps you..One notable difference is differed instantiation that comes with Singletons.With static classes, it gets created by the CLR and we have not control on it.\nwith singletons, the object gets instantiated on the first instance it\'s tried to be accessed.In many cases, these two have no practical difference, especially if the singleton instance never changes or changes very slowly e.g. holding configurations. I\'d say the biggest difference is a singleton is still a normal Java Bean as oppose to a specialized static-only Java class. And because of this, a singleton is accepted in many more situations; it is in fact the default Spring Framework\'s instantiation strategy. The consumer may or may not know it\'s a singleton being passed around, it just treat it like a normal Java bean. If requirement changes and a singleton needs to become a prototype instead, as we often see in Spring, it can be done totally seamlessly without a line of code change to the consumer.Someone else has mentioned earlier that a static class should be purely procedural e.g. java.lang.Math. In my mind, such a class should never be passed around and they should never hold anything other than static final as attributes. For everything else, use a singleton since it\'s much more flexible and easier to maintain.a. Serialization - Static members belong to the class and hence can\'t be serialized.b. Though we have made the constructor private, static member variables still will be carried to subclass.c. We can\'t do lazy initialization as everything will be loaded upon class loading only.  From a client perspective, static behavior is known to the client but Singleton behavior can be completed hidden from a client. Client may never know that there only one single instance he\'s playing around with again and again.I read the following and think it makes sense too:Taking Care of Business Remember, one of the most important OO rules is that an object is responsible for itself. This means that issues regarding the life cycle of a class should be handled in the class, not delegated to language constructs like static, and so on.from the book Objected-Oriented Thought Process 4th Ed.In an article I wrote I have described my point of view about why the singleton is much better than a static class:When I want class with full functionality, e.g. there are many methods and variables, I use singleton;If I want class with only one or two methods in it, e.g. MailService class, which has only 1 method SendMail() I use static class and method.There is a huge difference between a single static class instance (that is, a single instance of a class, which happens to be a static or global variable) and a single static pointer to an instance of the class on the heap:When your application exits, the destructor of the static class instance will be called. That means if you used that static instance as a singleton, your singleton ceased working properly. If there is still code running that uses that singleton, for example in a different thread, that code is likely to crash. We can create the object of singleton class and pass it to method. Singleton class doesn\'t any restriction of inheritance. We can\'t dispose the objects of a static class but can singleton class.As I understand the difference between a Static class and non-Static Singleton class, the static is simply a non-instantiated "type" in C#, where the Singleton is a true "object". In other words, all the static members in a static class are assigned to the type but in the Singleton are housed under the object. But keep in mind, a static class still behaves like a reference type as its not a value type like a Struct.That means when you create a Singleton, because the class itself isnt static but its member is, the advantage is the static member inside the Singleton that refers to itself is connected to an actual "object" rather than a hollow "type" of itself. That sort of clarifies now the difference between a Static and a Non-Static Singleton beyond its other features and memory usage, which is confusing for me.Both use static members which are single copies of a member, but the Singleton wraps the referenced member around a true instantiated "object" who\'s address exists in addition to its static member. That object itself has properties wherein in can be passed around and referenced, adding value. The Static class is just a type so it doesn\'t exist except to point to its static members. That concept sort of cemented the purpose of the Singleton vs Static Class beyond the inheritance and other issues.
