This has always confused me. It seems like this would be nicer:Than this:Is there a specific reason it is like this?It\'s because any iterable can be joined, not just lists, but the result and the "joiner" are always strings.E.G:Because the join() method is in the string class, instead of the list class?I agree it looks funny.See http://www.faqs.org/docs/diveintopython/odbchelper_join.html:Historical note. When I first learned\n  Python, I expected join to be a method\n  of a list, which would take the\n  delimiter as an argument. Lots of\n  people feel the same way, and there\xe2\x80\x99s\n  a story behind the join method. Prior\n  to Python 1.6, strings didn\xe2\x80\x99t have all\n  these useful methods. There was a\n  separate string module which contained\n  all the string functions; each\n  function took a string as its first\n  argument. The functions were deemed\n  important enough to put onto the\n  strings themselves, which made sense\n  for functions like lower, upper, and\n  split. But many hard-core Python\n  programmers objected to the new join\n  method, arguing that it should be a\n  method of the list instead, or that it\n  shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t move at all but simply stay\n  a part of the old string module (which\n  still has lots of useful stuff in it).\n  I use the new join method exclusively,\n  but you will see code written either\n  way, and if it really bothers you, you\n  can use the old string.join function\n  instead.This was discussed in the String methods... finally thread in the Python-Dev achive, and was accepted by Guido. This thread began in Jun 1999, and str.join was included in Python 1.6 which was released in Sep 2000 (and supported Unicode). Python 2.0 (supported str methods including join) was released in Oct 2000.There are no other reasons offered in this thread.Here are some additional thoughts (my own, and my friend\'s):Guido\'s decision is recorded in a historical mail, deciding on str.join(seq):Funny, but it does seem right!  Barry, go for it...\n  --Guido van RossumI agree that it\'s counterintuitive at first, but there\'s a good reason. Join can\'t be a method of a list because:There are actually two join methods (Python 3.0):If join was a method of a list, then it would have to inspect its arguments to decide which one of them to call. And you can\'t join byte and str together, so the way they have it now makes sense. This is because join is a "string" method! It creates a string from any iterable. If we stuck the method on lists, what about when we have iterables that aren\'t lists? What if you have a tuple of strings? If this were a list method, you would have to cast every such iterator of strings as a list before you could join the elements into a single string! For example:Let\'s roll our own list join method:And to use it, note that we have to first create a list from each iterable to join the strings in that iterable, wasting both memory and processing power:So we see we have to add an extra step to use our list method, instead of just using the builtin string method:The algorithm Python uses to create the final string with str.join actually has to pass over the iterable twice, so if you provide it a generator expression, it has to materialize it into a list first before it can create the final string. Thus, while passing around generators is usually better than list comprehensions, str.join is an exception:Nevertheless, the str.join operation is still semantically a "string" operation, so it still makes sense to have it on the str object than on miscellaneous iterables.Think of it as the natural orthogonal operation to split.I understand why it is applicable to anything iterable and so can\'t easily be implemented just on list.For readability, I\'d like to see it in the language but I don\'t think that is actually feasible - if iterability were an interface then it could be added to the interface but it is just a convention and so there\'s no central way to add it to the set of things which are iterable.Primarily because the result of a someString.join() is a string.The sequence (list or tuple or whatever) doesn\'t appear in the result, just a string.  Because the result is a string, it makes sense as a method of a string.
