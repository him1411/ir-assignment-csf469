I\'m using placeholders for text inputs which is working out just fine. But I\'d like to use a placeholder for my selectboxes as well. Ofcourse I can just use this code:But the \'Select your option\' is in black instead of lightgrey. So my solution could possibly be CSS-based. jQuery is fine too. This only makes the option grey in the dropdown (so after clicking the arrow):Edit: The question is: how do people create placeholders in selectboxes? But it has already been answered, cheers.And using this results in the selected value always being grey (even after selecting a real option):How about a non CSS - no javascript/jQuery answer?Just stumbled across this question, here\'s what works in FireFox & Chrome (at least)The Disabled option stops the <option> being selected with both mouse and keyboard, whereas just using \'display:none\' allows the user to still select via the keyboard arrows. The \'display:none\' style just makes the list box look \'nice\'.Note: Using an empty value attribute on the "placeholder" option allows validation (required attribute) to work around having the "placeholder", so if the option isn\'t changed but is required; the browser should prompt the user to choose an option from the list.Update (July 2015):This method is confirmed working in the following browsers:Update (October 2015):Removed the style="display: none" in favour of HTML5 attribute hidden which has wide support. The hidden element has similar traits as display: none in Safari, IE, (Project Spartan needs checking) where the option is visible in dropdown but is not selectable.Update (January 2016):When the select element is required it allows use of the :invalid CSS pseudo-class which allows you to style the select element when in it\'s "placeholder" state. :invalid works here because of the empty value in the placeholder option.Once a value has been set the :invalid pseudo-class will be dropped. You can optionally also use :valid if you so wish.Most browsers support this pseudo-class. IE10+. This works best with custom styled select elements; In some cases i.e. ( Mac in Chrome / Safari) you\'ll need to change the default appearance of the select box so that certain styles display i.e. background-color, color. You can find some examples and more about compatibility at developer.mozilla.org.Native element appearance Mac in Chrome:Using altered border element Mac in Chrome:For a required field, there is a pure-CSS solution in modern browsers:Something like this maybe?HTML:CSS:JavaScript:Working example: http://jsfiddle.net/Zmf6t/I just added hidden attribute in option like below, It is working fine for me.That solution works in FireFox also:\nWithout any JS.  I had the same problem and while searching came across this question, and after I found good solution for me I would like to share it with you guys in case some one can benefit from it.\nhere it is:\nHTML:CSS:JS:After customer makes first select no need for gray color so JS removes the class place_holder.\nI hope this helps someone :)Update: Thanks to @user1096901, as a work around for IE browser, you can add place_holder class again in case first option is selected again :)I see signs of correct answers but to bring it all together this would be my solution.here is mineAnother possibility in JS:JSFiddleHere is a CSS solution that works beautifully. The content is added (and absolutely positioned relative to the container) after the containing element (via :after pseudo-class). It gets its text from the placeholder attribute that I defined where I used the directive (attr(placeholder)). Another key factor is pointer-events: none - this allows clicks on the placeholder text to pass through to the select. Otherwise it won\'t drop down if the user clicks the text.I add the .empty class myself in my select directive but normally I find that angular adds/removes .ng-empty for me (I assume it\'s b/c I\'m injecting version 1.2 of Angular in my code sample)(The sample also demonstrates how to wrap HTML elements in angularJS to create your own custom inputs)You can do this without using Javascript using only HTML You need to set default select option\n  disabled="" and selected="" and select tag required="". Browser\n  doesn\'t allow user to submit the form without selecting an option.I wanted the SELECT to be grey until selected so for this piece of HTML:I\'ve added these CSS definitions:It works as expected in Chrome / Safari, maybe also in other browsers but I haven\'t checked.I couldn\'t get any of these to work currently, because for me it is (1) not required and (2) need the option to return to default selectable.  So here\'s a heavy handed option if you are using jquery:In respect to all solutions above, but this one seems to be most valid due to HTML specs:UPDATE: Pardon me for this incorrect answer, this is definitely not a placeholder solution for the select element, but a title for grouped options under opened select element list.
