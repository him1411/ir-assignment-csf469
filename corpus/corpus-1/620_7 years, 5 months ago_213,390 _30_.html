Many of you have probably seen the command that allows you to write on a file that needs root permission, even when you forgot to open vim with sudo:The thing is that I don\'t get what is exactly happening here.I have already figured this:\nw is for thisso it passes all the lines as standard input.The !sudo tee part calls tee with administrator privileges.For all to make sense, the % should output the filename (as a parameter for tee), but I can\'t find references on the help for this behavior.tl;dr Could someone help me dissect this command?As eugene y pointed out, % does indeed mean "the current file name". Another use for this in Vim is in substitution commands. For example, :%s/foo/bar means "in the current file, replace occurrences of foo with bar." If you highlight some text before typing :s, you\'ll see that the highlighted lines take the place of % as your substitution range.One confusing part of this trick is that you might think :w is modifying your file, but it isn\'t. If you opened and modified file1.txt, then ran :w file2.txt, it would be a "save as"; file1.txt wouldn\'t be modified, but the current buffer contents would be sent to file2.txt.Instead of file2.txt, you can substitute a shell command to receive the buffer contents. For instance, :w !cat will just display the contents.If Vim wasn\'t run with sudo access, its :w can\'t modify a protected file, but if it passes the buffer contents to the shell, a command in the shell can be run with sudo. In this case, we use tee.As for tee, picture the tee command as a T-shaped pipe in a normal bash piping situation: it directs output to specified file(s) and also sends it to standard output, which can be captured by the next piped command. For example, in ps -ax | tee processes.txt | grep \'foo\', the list of processes will be written to a text file and passed along to grep.(Diagram created with Asciiflow.)See the tee man page for more info.In the situation your question describes, using tee is a hack because we\'re ignoring half of what it does. sudo tee writes to our file and also sends the buffer contents to standard output, but we ignore standard output. We don\'t need to pass anything to another piped command in this case; we\'re just using tee as an alternate way of writing a file and so that we can call it with sudo.You can add this to your .vimrc to make this trick easy-to-use: just type :w!!.The > /dev/null part explicitly throws away the standard output, since, as I said, we don\'t need to pass anything to another piped command.In the executed command line, % stands for the current file name. This is documented in :help cmdline-special:As you\'ve already found out, :w !cmd pipes the contents of the current buffer to another command. What tee does is copy standard input to one or more files, and also to standard output. Therefore, :w !sudo tee % > /dev/null effectively writes the contents of the current buffer to the current file while being root. Another command that can be used for this is dd:As a shortcut, you can add this mapping to your .vimrc:With the above you can type :w!!<Enter> to save the file as root.:w - Write a file.!sudo - Call shell sudo command.tee - The output of write (vim :w) command redirected using tee. The % is nothing but current file name i.e. /etc/apache2/conf.d/mediawiki.conf. In other words tee command is run as root and it takes standard input and write it to a file represented by %. However, this will prompt to reload file again (hit L to load changes in vim itself):tutorial linkThis also works well:This is inspired by the comment of @Nathan Long. NOTICE:" must be used instead of \' because we want % to be expanded before passing to shell.
