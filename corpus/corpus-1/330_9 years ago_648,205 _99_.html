What is reflection, and why is it useful?I\'m particularly interested in Java, but I assume the principles are the same in any language.The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).For example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a \'doSomething\' method on it if one exists. Java\'s static typing system isn\'t really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called \'doSomething\' and then call it if you want to.So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) :One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the @Test annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.There are some good reflection examples to get you started at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.htmlAnd finally, yes, the concepts are pretty much similar in other statically types languages which support reflection (like C#). In dynamically typed languages, the use case described above is less necessary (since the compiler will allow any method to be called on any object, failing at runtime if it does not exist), but the second case of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.Reflection is a language\'s ability to inspect and dynamically call classes, methods, attributes, etc. at runtime.For example, all objects in Java have the method getClass(), which lets you determine the object\'s class even if you don\'t know it at compile time (e.g. if you declared it as an Object) - this might seem trivial, but such reflection is not possible in less dynamic languages such as C++. More advanced uses lets you list and call methods, constructors, etc.Reflection is important since it lets you write programs that do not have to "know" everything at compile time, making them more dynamic, since they can be tied together at runtime. The code can be written against known interfaces, but the actual classes to be used can be instantiated using reflection from configuration files.Lots of modern frameworks use reflection extensively for this very reason. Most other modern languages use reflection as well, and in scripting languages (such as Python) they are even more tightly integrated, since it feels more natural within the general programming model of those languages.One of my favorite uses of reflection is the below Java dump method. It takes any object as a parameter and uses the Java reflection API print out every field name and value.Uses of ReflectionReflection is commonly used by programs which require the ability to examine or modify the runtime behavior of applications running in the Java virtual machine. This is a relatively advanced feature and should be used only by developers who have a strong grasp of the fundamentals of the language. With that caveat in mind, reflection is a powerful technique and can enable applications to perform operations which would otherwise be impossible.Extensibility FeaturesAn application may make use of external, user-defined classes by creating instances of extensibility objects using their fully-qualified names.\nClass Browsers and Visual Development Environments\nA class browser needs to be able to enumerate the members of classes. Visual development environments can benefit from making use of type information available in reflection to aid the developer in writing correct code.\nDebuggers and Test Tools\nDebuggers need to be able to examine private members on classes. Test harnesses can make use of reflection to systematically call a discoverable set APIs defined on a class, to insure a high level of code coverage in a test suite.Drawbacks of ReflectionReflection is powerful, but should not be used indiscriminately. If it is possible to perform an operation without using reflection, then it is preferable to avoid using it. The following concerns should be kept in mind when accessing code via reflection.Because reflection involves types that are dynamically resolved, certain Java virtual machine optimizations can not be performed. Consequently, reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications.Reflection requires a runtime permission which may not be present when running under a security manager. This is in an important consideration for code which has to run in a restricted security context, such as in an Applet.Since reflection allows code to perform operations that would be illegal in non-reflective code, such as accessing private fields and methods, the use of reflection can result in unexpected side-effects, which may render code dysfunctional and may destroy portability. Reflective code breaks abstractions and therefore may change behavior with upgrades of the platform.source: The Reflection APIReflection is a key mechanism to allow an application or framework to work with code that might not have even been written yet!Take for example your typical web.xml file. This will contain a list of servlet elements, which contain nested servlet-class elements. The servlet container will process the web.xml file, and create new a new instance of each servlet class through reflection.Another example would be the Java API for XML Parsing (JAXP). Where an XML parser provider is \'plugged-in\' via well-known system properties, which are used to construct new instances through reflection.And finally, the most comprehensive example is Spring which uses reflection to create its beans, and for its heavy use of proxiesNot every language supports reflection but the principles are usually the same in languages that support it.Reflection is the ability to "reflect" on the structure of your program. Or more concrete. To look at the objects and classes you have and programmatically get back information on the methods, fields, and interfaces they implement. You can also look at things like annotations.It\'s usefull in a lot of situations. Everywhere you want to be able to dynamically plug in classes into your code. Lot\'s of object relational mappers use reflection to be able to instantiate objects from databases without knowing in advance what objects they\'re going to use. Plug-in architectures is another place where reflection is usefull. Being able to dynamically load code and determine if there are types there that implement the right interface to use as a plugin is important in those situations.Reflection allows instantiation of new objects, invocation of methods, and get/set operations on class variables dynamically at run time without having prior knowledge of its implementation.In above example the null parameter is the object you want to invoke the method on. If the method is static you supply null. If the method is not static, then while invoking you need to supply a valid MyObject instance instead of null.Reflection also allows you to access private member/methods of a class:.Reflection is a very powerful API but it may slow down the application if used in excess, as it resolves all the types at runtime.Example :\nTake for example a remote application which gives your application an object which you obtain using their API Methods . Now based on the object you might need to perform some sort of computation . The provider guarantees that object can be of 3 types and we need to perform computation based on what type of object . So we might implement in 3 classes each containing a different logic .Obviously the object  information is available in runtime so you cannot statically code to perform computation hence reflection is used to instantiate the object of the class that you require to perform the computation based on the object received from the provider .Java Reflection is quite powerful and can be very useful.\nJava Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods etc. at compile time.\nIt is also possible to instantiate new objects, invoke methods and get/set field values using reflection.A quick Java Reflection example to show you what using reflection looks like:This example obtains the Class object from the class called MyObject. Using the class object the example gets a list of the methods in that class, iterates the methods and print out their names.Exactly how all this works is explained hereEdit: After almost 1 year I am editing this answer as while reading about reflection I got few more uses of Reflection.When the Spring context processes this < bean > element, it will use Class.forName(String) with the argument "com.example.Foo" to instantiate that Class. It will then again use reflection to get the appropriate setter for the < property > element and set its value to the specified value.For Private methods,For private fields,As per my understanding:Reflection allows programmer to access entities in program dynamically. i.e. while coding an application if programmer is unaware about a class or its methods, he can make use of such class dynamically (at run time) by using reflection.It is frequently used in scenarios where a class name changes frequently. If such a situation arises, then it is complicated for the programmer to rewrite the application and change the name of the class again and again.Instead, by using reflection, there is need to worry about a possibly changing class name.simple example for reflection.\nIn a Chess Game, you do not know what will be moved by the user at run time. reflection can be used to call methods which are already implemented at run time.Reflection is a set of functions which allows you to access the runtime information of your program and modify it behavior (with some limitations).It\'s useful because it allows you to change the runtime behaivour depending on the meta information of your program, that is, you can check the return type of a function and change the way you handle the situation.In C# for example you can load an assembly (a .dll) in runtime an examine it, navigating through the classes and taking actions according to what you found. It also let you create an instance of a class on runtime, invoke its method, etc.Where can it be useful? Is not useful everytime but for concrete situations. For example you can use it to get the name of the class for loggin purposes, to dinamically create handlers for events according to what\'s specified on a configuration file and so on...From java documentation pagejava.lang.reflect package provides classes and interfaces for obtaining reflective information about classes and objects. Reflection allows programmatic access to information about the fields, methods and constructors of loaded classes, and the use of reflected fields, methods, and constructors to operate on their underlying counterparts, within security restrictions.AccessibleObject allows suppression of access checks if the necessary ReflectPermission is available.Classes in this package, along with java.lang.Class accommodate applications such as debuggers, interpreters, object inspectors, class browsers, and services such as Object Serialization and JavaBeans that need access to either the public members of a target object (based on its runtime class) or the members declared by a given classIt includes following functionality.Have a look at this documentation link for the methods exposed by Class class.From this article (by Dennis Sosnoski, President, Sosnoski Software Solutions, Inc)  and this article (security-explorations pdf):I can see considerable drawbacks than uses of using ReflectionUser of Reflection:Drawbacks of Reflection:General abuses:Have a look at this SE question regarding abuse of reflection feature:How do I read a private field in Java?Summary:Insecure use of its functions conducted from within a system code can also easily lead to the compromise of a Java security model. So use this feature sparinglyReflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behaviour of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.The java.lang and java.lang.reflect packages provide classes for java reflection.Reflection can be used to get information about \xe2\x80\x93Class The getClass() method is used to get the name of the class to which an object belongs.Constructors The getConstructors() method is used to get the public constructors of the class to which an object belongs.Methods The getMethods() method is used to get the public methods of the class to which an objects belongs.The Reflection API is mainly used in:IDE (Integrated Development Environment) e.g. Eclipse, MyEclipse, NetBeans etc.\nDebugger and Test Tools etc.Advantages of Using Reflection:Extensibility Features: An application may make use of external, user-defined classes by creating instances of extensibility objects using their fully-qualified names.Debugging and testing tools: Debuggers use the property of reflection to examine private members on classes.Drawbacks:Performance Overhead: Reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications.Exposure of Internals: Reflective code breaks abstractions and therefore may change behaviour with upgrades of the platform.Ref: Java Reflection javarevisited.blogspot.inI just want to add some point to all that was listed.With Reflection API you can write universal toString() method for any object.It is useful at debugging.Here is some example:Reflection has many uses. The one I am more familiar with, is to be able to create code on the fly. IE: dynamic classes, functions, constructors - based on any data\n  (xml/array/sql results/hardcoded/etc..)As name itself suggest it reflects what it holds for example class method,etc apart from providing feature to invoke method creating instance dynamically at runtime.It is used by many frameworks and application under the wood to invoke services without actually knowing the code. Reflection is to let object to see their appearance. This argument seems nothing to do with reflection. In fact, this is the "self-identify" ability.Reflection itself is a word for such languages that lack capability of self-knowledge and self-sensing as Java and C#. Because they do not have the capability of self-knowledge, when we want to observe how it looks like, we must have another thing to reflect how it looks like. Excellent dynamic languages such as Ruby and Python can perceive the reflection of their own without the help of other individuals. We can say that the object of Java cannot perceive how it looks like without a mirror, which is an object of the reflection class, but object in Python can perceive it without a mirror. So that\'s why we need reflection in Java.Reflection gives you ability to write more generic code . It allows you to create object at runtime and call its method at runtime. Hence the program can be made higly parameterised. It also allow to introspect the object and class to detect its variables and method exposed to outer world.Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods etc. at compile time. Mostly at framework level the maximum benefits of reflection can be achieved. The byte code that is compiled if needs extra modification at run time for examination, modification, addition of more byte code within itself, or another program or another framework at method level, instance variable level, constructor level, annotation level reflection can be useful.Suppose you have a method add(Int a,int b). The equivalent byte code is suppose B1. If suppose you have 1000 methods named add in your system. Now you want to check the value of parameter a and b before method add is called. So, you can glue your code to another program or framework that uses reflection to dynamically examine the byte code value using Object.getClass.getMethod(). There are several classes for examining. It can add more operation before method add is called. But, the program itself or another program or framework does not know about the object that has a method named add. Mostly in dependency injection, aspect oriented programming use of reflection is mostly used.
