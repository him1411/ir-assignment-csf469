How do I remove a Git submodule?By the way, is there a reason I can\'t simply do ?Since git1.8.3 (April 22d, 2013):There was no Porcelain way to say "I no longer am interested in this submodule", once you express your interest in a submodule with "submodule init".\n  "submodule deinit" is the way to do so. The deletion process also uses git rm (since git1.8.5 October 2013).  The all removal process would then be:rm -rf: This is mentioned in Daniel Schroeder\'s answer, and summarized by Eonil in the comments:This leaves .git/modules/<path-to-submodule>/ unchanged.\n  So if you once delete a submodule with this method and re-add them again, it will not be possible because repository already been corrupted.git rm: See commit 95c16418:Currently using "git rm" on a submodule removes the submodule\'s work tree from that of the superproject and the gitlink from the index.\n  But the submodule\'s section in .gitmodules is left untouched, which is a leftover of the now removed submodule and might irritate users (as opposed to the setting in .git/config, this must stay as a reminder that the user showed interest in this submodule so it will be repopulated later when an older commit is checked out).Let "git rm" help the user by not only removing the submodule from the work tree but by also removing the "submodule.<submodule name>" section from the .gitmodules file and stage both.git submodule deinit: It stems from this patch:With "git submodule init" the user is able to tell git they care about one or more submodules and wants to have it populated on the next call to "git submodule update".\n  But currently there is no easy way they can tell git they do not care about a submodule anymore and wants to get rid of the local work tree (unless the user knows a lot about submodule internals and removes the "submodule.$name.url" setting from .git/config together with the work tree himself).Help those users by providing a \'deinit\' command.\n  This removes the whole submodule.<name> section from .git/config either for the given\n  submodule(s) (or for all those which have been initialized if \'.\' is given).\n  Fail if the current work tree contains modifications unless forced.\n  Complain when for a submodule given on the command line the url setting can\'t be found in .git/config, but nonetheless don\'t fail. This takes care if the (de)initialization steps (.git/config and .git/modules/xxx)Since git1.8.5, the git rm takes also care of the:If you forget that last step, and try to add what was a submodule as a regular directory, you would get error message like:Via the page Git Submodule Tutorial:To remove a submodule you need to:Just a note. Since git 1.8.5.2, two commands will do:As @Mark Cheverton\'s answer correctly pointed out, if the second line isn\'t used, even if you removed the submodule for now, the remnant .git/modules/the_submodule folder will prevent the same submodule from being added back or replaced in the future. Also, as @VonC mentioned, git rm will do most of the job on a submodule.--Update (07/05/2017)--Just to clarify, the_submodule is the relative path of the submodule inside the project. For example, it\'s subdir/my_submodule if the submodule is inside a subdirectory subdir.As pointed out correctly in the comments and other answers, the two commands (although functionally sufficient to remove a submodule), do leave a trace in the [submodule "the_submodule"] section of .git/config (as of July 2017), which can be removed using a third command:Simple stepsPlease note: $submodulepath doesn\'t contain leading or trailing slashes.BackgroundWhen you do git submodule add, it only adds it to .gitmodules, but\nonce you did git submodule init, it added to .git/config.So if you wish to remove the modules, but be able to restore it quickly,\nthen do just this:It is a good idea to do git rebase HEAD first and git commit\nat the end, if you put this in a script.Also have a look at an answer to Can I unpopulate a Git submodule?.The majority of answers to this question are outdated, incomplete, or unnecessarily complex.A submodule cloned using git 1.7.8 or newer will leave at most four traces of itself in your local repo. The process for removing those four traces is given by the three commands below:In addition to the recommendations, I also had to rm -Rf .git/modules/path/to/submodule to be able to add a new submodule with the same name (in my case I was replacing a fork with the original) You must remove the entry in .gitmodules and .git/config, and remove the directory of the module from the history:If you\'ll write on git\'s mailing list probably someone will do a shell script for you.To remove a submodule added using:Run:That\'s it. For old versions of git (circa ~1.8.5) use:You can use an alias to automate the solutions provided by others:Put that in your git config, and then you can do: git rms path/to/submoduleTo summarize, this is what you should do :Set path_to_submodule var (no trailing slash): path_to_submodule=path/to/submoduleDelete the relevant line from the .gitmodules file:git config -f .gitmodules --remove-section submodule.$path_to_submoduleDelete the relevant section from .git/configgit config -f .git/config --remove-section submodule.$path_to_submoduleUnstage and remove $path_to_submodule only from the index (to prevent losing information) git rm --cached $path_to_submoduleTrack changes made to .gitmodulesgit add .gitmodulesCommit the superprojectgit commit -m "Remove submodule submodule_name"Delete the now untracked submodule filesrm -rf $path_to_submodulerm -rf .git/modules/$path_to_submoduleIf the submodule was accidentally added because you added, committed and pushed a folder that was already a Git repository (contained .git), you won\xe2\x80\x99t have a .gitmodules file to edit, or anything in .git/config. In this case all you need is :FWIW, I also removed the .git folder before doing the git add.After experimenting with all the different answers on this site, I ended up with this solution:This restores the exact same state as before you added the submodule. You can right away add the submodule again, which was not possible with most of the answers here.This leaves you with a clean checkout with no changes to commit.This was tested with:What I\'m currently doing Dec 2012 (combines most of these answers): Here is what I did :1.) Delete the relevant section from the .gitmodules file. You can use below command:2.) Stage the .gitmodules changes 3.) Delete the relevant section from .git/config. You can use below command:4.) Remove the gitlink (no trailing slash):5.) Cleanup the .git/modules:6.) Commit:7.) Delete the now untracked submodule filesI had to take John Douthat\'s steps one step further and cd into the submodule\'s directory, and then remove the Git repository: Then I could commit the files as a part of the parent Git repository without the old reference to a submodule.I recently find out a git project which include many useful git related command: https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extrasInstall it and type :Then things are done. The submodule directory will be removed from your repo and still exist in your filesystem. You can then commit the change like: git commit -am "Remove the submodule".I found deinit works good for me:From git docs:deinitUnregister the given submodules, i.e. remove the whole submodule.$name\n  section from .git/config together with their work tree.I just found the .submodule (forgot exact name) hidden file, it has a list... you can erase them individually that way. I just had one, so I deleted it. Simple, but it might mess up Git, since I don\'t know if anything\'s attached to the submodule. Seems ok so far, aside from libetpan\'s usual upgrade issue, but that\'s (hopefully) unrelated. Noticed nobody posted manual erasing, so addedIf you have just added the submodule, and for example, you simply added the wrong submodule or you added it to the wrong place, simply do git stash then delete the folder. This is assuming that adding the submodule is the only thing you did in the recent repo.Here are the 4 steps that I found necessary or useful (important ones first):In theory, git rm in step 1 should take care of it. Hopefully, the second part of OP question can be answered positively one day (that this can be done in one command). But as of July 2017, step 2 is necessary to remove data in .git/modules/ for otherwise, you can\'t e.g. add the submodule back in the future. You can probably get away with the above two steps for git 1.8.5+ as tinlyx\'s answer noted, as all git submodule commands seem to work.Step 3 removes the section for the_submodule in the file .git/config. This should be done for completeness. (The entry may cause problems for older git versions, but I don\'t have one to test).For this, most answers suggest using git submodule deinit. I find it more explicit and less confusing to use git config -f .git/config --remove-section. According to the git-submodule documentation, git deinit:Unregister the given submodules ... If you really want to remove a\n  submodule from the repository and commit that use git-rm[1]\n  instead.Last but not least, if you don\'t  git commit, you will/may get an error when doing git submodule summary (as of git 2.7):This is regardless of whether you do steps 2 or 3.
