+ is for the next sibling. Is there an equivalent for the previous sibling?No, there is no "previous sibling" selector.On a related note, ~ is for general successor sibling (meaning the element comes after this one, but not necessarily immediately after) and is a CSS3 selector. + is for next sibling and is CSS2.1.See Adjacent sibling combinator from Selectors Level 3 and 5.7 Adjacent sibling selectors from Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS 2.1) Specification.I found a way to style all previous siblings (opposite of ~) that may work depending on what you need.Let\'s say you have a list of links and when hovering on one, all the previous ones should turn red. You can do it like this:Selectors level 4 introduces ! which (if I\'m interpreting the draft correctly) will allow you to select the desired subject of the selector (in this case previous) with:\xe2\x80\xa6 but at the time of writing, it is some distance beyond the bleeding edge for browser support.Is there a \xe2\x80\x9cprevious sibling\xe2\x80\x9d CSS selector?This question is somewhat of an oxymoron.Cascading Style Sheets. A cascade is like a waterfall: there\'s no backward motion. So, naturally, there is no previous sibling selector in CSS.However...In particular, the flex order property can move elements around the screen.Here\'s an example:You want element A to turn red when element B is hovered.STEPSMake the ul a flex container.Reverse the order of siblings in the mark-up.Use a sibling selector to target Element A  (~ or + will do) .Use the flex order property to restore the order of siblings on the visual display....and voil\xc3\xa0! A previous sibling selector is born (or at least simulated).Here\'s the full code:From the spec:5.4. Display Order: the order propertyFlex items are, by default, displayed and laid out in the same order as they appear in the source document. The \n  order property can be used to change this ordering.The order property controls the order in which children of a flex container appear within the flex container, by \n  assigning them to ordinal groups. It takes a single <integer> value, which specifies which ordinal group the flex item \n  belongs to.The initial order value for all flex items is 0.Browser support: Flexbox is supported by all major browsers, except IE < 10. Some recent browser versions, such as Safari 8 and IE10, require vendor prefixes. For a quick way to add prefixes use Autoprefixer. More details in this answer.Flexbox is shattering long-held beliefs about CSS.One such belief is that a previous sibling selector is not possible in CSS.To say this belief is widespread would be an understatement. Here\'s a sampling of related questions on Stack Overflow alone:As described above, this belief is not entirely true. A previous sibling selector can be simulated in CSS using the flex order property.The z-index MythAnother long-standing belief has been that z-index works only on positioned elements.In fact, the most current version of the spec – the W3C Editor\'s Draft – still asserts this to be true:9.9.1 Specifying the stack level: the z-index\n  propertyz-index(emphasis added)In reality, however, this information is obsolete and inaccurate.Elements that are flex items or grid items can create stacking contexts even when position is static.4.3. Flex Item Z-OrderingFlex items paint exactly the same as inline blocks, except that order-modified document order is used in place of raw \n  document order, and z-index values other than auto create a stacking context even if position is static.5.4. Z-axis Ordering: the z-index propertyThe painting order of grid items is exactly the same as inline blocks, except that order-modified document order is \n  used in place of raw document order, and z-index values other than auto create a stacking context even if \n  position is static. Here\'s a demonstration of z-index working on non-positioned flex items: https://jsfiddle.net/m0wddwxs/I had the same question, but then I had a "duh" moment.   Instead of writingwrite Obviously this matches "x" instead of "y", but it answers the "is there a match?" question, and simple DOM traversal may get you to the right element more efficiently than looping in javascript.I realize that the original question was a CSS question so this answer is probably completely irrelevant, but other Javascript users may stumble on the question via search like I did.Two tricks. Basically inverting the HTML order of your desired elements in HTML and using\n~ Next siblings operator:There is no official way to do that at the moment but you can use a little trick to achieve this ! Remember that it is experimental and it has some limitation ...\n(check this link if you worries about navigator compatibility )What you can do is use a CSS3 selector : the pseudo classe called nth-child()http://jsfiddle.net/aLhv9r1w/316/+ is for the next sibling. Is there an equivalent for the previous\n  sibling?There are 2 subsequent sibling selectors in conventional CSS:In conventional CSS, there is no previous sibling selector.However, in the axe CSS post-processor library, there are 2 previous sibling selectors:Working Example:In the example below:If you know the exact position an :nth-child()-based exclusion of all following siblings would work.Which would select all lis before the 3rd (e.g. 1st and 2nd). But, in my opinion this looks ugly and has a very tight usecase.You also could select the nth-child right-to-left:Which does the same.You can use inverse the order of elements in HTML. Then besides using order as in Michael_B\'s answer you can use flex-direction: row-reverse; or flex-direction: column-reverse; depending on your layout.Working sample:There is no "previous" sibling selector unfortunately, but you can possibly still get the same effect by using positioning (e.g. float right). It depends on what you are trying to do.In my case, I wanted a primarily CSS 5-star rating system. I would need to color (or swap the icon of) the previous stars. By floating each element right, I am essentially getting the same effect (the html for the stars thus must be written \'backwards\').I\'m using FontAwesome in this example and swapping between the unicodes of fa-star-o and fa-star\nhttp://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/CSS:HTML:\n    \n        \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n        \n        (40)\n    JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/andrewleyva/88j0105g/Depending on your exact objective, there is a way to achieve the usefulness of a parent selector without using one (even if one were to exist)...Say we have:What can we do to make the Socks block (including sock colours) stand out visually using spacing?What would be nice but doesn\'t exist:What does exist:This sets all anchor links to have 15px margin on the top and resets it back to 0 for those with no UL elements (or other tags) inside LIs.
