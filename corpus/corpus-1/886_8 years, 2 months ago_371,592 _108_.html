I\'ve seen some books and articles have some really pretty looking graphs of git branches and commits. How can I make high-quality printable images of git history?Update: This answer has gotten far more attention than it deserves.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was originally posted because I think the graphs look nice and they could be drawn-over in Illustrator for a publication\xe2\x80\x93 and there was no better solution.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But there now exists much more applicable answers to this Q, such as fracz\'s, Jubobs\', or Harry Lee\'s!\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Please go upvote those!!Update 2: I\'ve posted an improved version of this answer to the Visualizing branch topology in git question, since it\'s far more appropriate there.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That version includes lg3, which shows both the author and committer info, so you really should check it out.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Leaving this answer for historical (& rep, I\'ll admit) reasons, though I\'m really tempted to just delete it.2\xc2\xa2: I have two aliases I normally throw in my ~/.gitconfig file:git lg/git lg1 looks like this:\nand git lg2 looks like this:\nFor textual output you can try:or:or: here\'s\n a graphviz alias for drawing the DAG graph.I personally use gitx, gitk --all and gitnub.Many of the answers here are great, but for those that just wants a simple one line to the point answer without having to setup aliases or anything extra, here it is: Not everyone would be doing a git log all the time, but when you need it just remember: " A Dog " = git log --all --decorate --oneline --graphGitgraph.js allows to draw pretty git branches without a repository. Just write a Javascript code that configures your branches and commits and render it in browser.or with metro template:or with commit messages, authors, and tags:Test it with JSFiddle.Generate it with Git Grapher by @bsara.Built on top of TikZ & PGF, gitdags is a little LaTeX package that allows you to effortlessly produce vector-graphics commit graphs, and more.Automatic generation of an existing repository\'s commit graph is not the purpose of gitdags; the graphs it produces are only meant for educational purposes.I often use it to produce graphs for my answers to Git questions, as an alternative to ASCII commit graphs:Here is an example of such a graph demonstrating the effects of a simple rebase:Gitg is a clone of Gitk and GitX for GNOME (it also works on KDE etc.) which shows a pretty colored graph.It is actively developed (as of 2012). It lets you sort the commits (graph nodes) either chronologically or topologically, and hide commits that don\'t lead to a selected branch.It works fine with large repositories and complex dependency graphs.Sample screenshots, showing the linux-git and linux-2.6 repositories:\nSourceTree is a really good one.  It does print out a good looking and medium size history and branch graph: (the following is done on an experimental Git project just to see some branches). Supports Windows 7+ and Mac OS X 10.6+.http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/git-forest is an excellent perl script I\'ve been using for more than a year and I hardly use the git log command directly any more.These are some of the things I love about this script:I have an alias using git-forest as follows:This is how the output looks like on a terminal:I just wrote one tool that can generate pretty git commits graph using HTML/Canvas.And provide a jQuery plugin which make it easy to use.[github] https://github.com/tclh123/commits-graphPreview:Based on a Graphviz script I found in an answer to a related question, I\'ve hacked up a ruby script that creates a summary view of a git repository.  It elides all linear history and just shows "interesting" commits, i.e. those with multiple parents, multiple children, or pointed to by a branch or tag.  Here\'s a snippet of the graph it generates for jquery:git-big-picture and BranchMaster are similar tools that try to show only the high-level structure of a graph, by only displaying how tags, branches, merges, etc. are related.This question has some more options.Depends on what they looked like.  I use gitx which makes pictures like this one:You can compare git log --graph vs. gitk on a 24-way octopus merge (originally from http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2008-12-24.html):I\'ve added three custom commands: git tree, git stree and git vtree. I\'ll go over them in that order.With git stree and git vtree I\'ve use bash to help with the formatting.EDIT: This works with git version 1.9a. The color value \'auto\' is apparently making its debut in this release. It\'s a nice addition because branch names will get a different color. This makes it easier to distinguish between local and remote branches for instance.For more detailed textual output, please try:                                   You can write alias in $HOME/.gitconfiggitg: a gtk-based repository viewer, that\'s new but interesting and useful\nhttp://git.gnome.org/browse/gitg\nI use it currentlyAlthough sometimes I use gitg, always come back to command line:As you can see is almost a keystroke saving aliases, based on:See in recent version of git (1.8.5 and above) you can benefit from %C(auto) in decorate placeholder %dFrom here all you need is a good understand of gitrevisions to filter whatever you need (something like master..develop, where --simplify-merges could help with long term branches)The power behind command line is the quickly config based on your needs (understand a repo isn\'t a unique key log configuration, so adding --numstat, or --raw, or --name-status is sometimes needed. Here git log and aliases are fast, powerful and (with time) the prettiest graph you can achieved. Even more, with output showed by default through a pager (say less) you can always search quickly inside results. Not convinced? You can always parse the result with projects like gitgraphI wrote a web tool for converting git logs into pretty SVG graphs:\nBit-Booster - Offline Commit Graph Drawing ToolUpload output from git log --pretty=\'%h|%p|%d\' directly into the tool and then click on the "download graph.svg" link.The tool is pure-client-side, and so none of your Git data is shared with my server.  You can also save the HTML + JS locally and run it using "file:///" URL\'s.   Verified on Chrome 48 and Firefox 43 on Ubuntu 12.04.It generates HTML that can be posted directly into any page (including the blogspot blogging engine!).  Take a look at some of the blog posts here:http://bit-booster.blogspot.ca/Here\'s a screenshot of a sample HTML file generated by the tool:http://bit-booster.com/graph.html (the tool)GitGraphGenerates a PNG or SVG representation of your Git repository\'s commit history.https://code.google.com/p/gitgraphVery slightly tweaking Slipp\'s awesome answer, you can use his aliases to log just one branch:By leaving off the --all you can now door evenI have this git log alias in ~/.gitconfig to view the graph history:With this in place, git l will output something like:In Git 2.12+ you can even customize the line colors of the graph using the log.graphColors configuration option. As for the logs\' format, it\'s similar to --oneline, with the addition of the author name (respecting .mailmap) and the relative author date. Note that the %C(auto) syntax, which tells Git to use the default colors for commit hash, etc. is supported in Git >= 1.8.3.Did you try gitk or gitk --all ?  However it doesn\'t have a print/save img as function.This is my terminal variation, similar to many answers here. I like to adjust the flags passed to less to prevent word wrapping.I set this to an alias for quick access since the command is a bit cumbersome.There\'s a funky Git commit graph as one of the demos of the Raphael web graphics library.The demo is static, but it should be easy enough to take the code and swap out their static data for a live set of data -- I think it\'s just Git commit data in JSON format.The demo is here: http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/github/impact.htmlI don\'t know about a direct tool, but maybe you can hack a script to export the data into dot format and render it with graphviz.Try ditaa. It can transform any ASCII diagram into an image. Although is was not designed with Git branches in mind, I was impressed by the results.Source (txt file):Command:Result:It also supports background colors, dashed lines, different shapes and more. See the examples.For OSX users, I\'ve taken the @gospes example and slightly modified it for gsed (gnu-sed installed via homebrew) and adjusted the colors (to work with a black background, not sure how the original example could possibly render the way it does in the example since it specifies black text on a terminal with a black background).The key for OSX is to first install gnu sed (which has the -r option). Most easily done with homebrew, which will not overwrite the system-installed sed, but will instead install gnu sed as "gsed". Hope this helps @SlippD.Thompson who commented above about OSX not working.git hist - Show the history of current branchgit hist --all - Show the graph of all branches (including remotes)git hist master devel - Show the relationship between two or more branchesgit hist --branches - Show all local branchesAdd --topo-order to sort commits topologically, instead of by date (default in this alias)git config --global alias.hist "log --graph --date-order --date=short --pretty=format:\'%C(auto)%h%d %C(reset)%s %C(bold blue)%ce %C(reset)%C(green)%cr (%cd)\'"
