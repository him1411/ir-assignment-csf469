I have a web server written in Node.js that I would like to launch with a specific folder. I\'m not sure how to access arguments in JavaScript. I\'m running node like this:Where server.js is my code. Node.js help says this is possible:How would I access those arguments in JavaScript? Somehow I was not able to find this information on the web.The arguments are stored in process.argvHere are the node docs on handling command line args:process.argv is an array containing the command line arguments. The first element will be \'node\', the second element will be the name of the JavaScript file. The next elements will be any additional command line arguments.This will generate:To normalize the arguments like a regular javascript function would receive, I do this in my node.js shell scripts:Note that the first arg is usually the path to nodejs, and the second arg is the location of the script you\'re executing.The up-to-date right answer for this it to use the minimist library. We used to use node-optimist but it has since been deprecated. Here is an example of how to use it taken straight from the minimist documentation:--Check out optimist library, it is much better than parsing command line options by hand.UpdateOptimist is deprecated. Try yargs which is an active fork of optimist.This returns:Official docsMinimist: For minimal argument parsing.Yargs: For slightly more sophisticated argument parsing.Commander.js: For building use-and-quit command-line applications, with built-in argument parsing.Meow: Alternative to Commander.jsVorpal.js: For building mature, interactive command-line applications, with built-in argument parsing.Works great for defining your options, actions, and arguments. It also generates the help pages for you.Works great for getting input from the user, if you like the callback approach.Works great for getting input from the user, if you like the generator approach.Several great answers here, but it all seems very complex. This is very similar to how bash scripts access argument values and it\'s already provided standard with node.js as MooGoo pointed out.\n(Just to make it understandable to somebody that\'s new to node.js)Example:The easiest way to parse command-line arguments in NodeJS is using the stdio module. Inspired by UNIX getopt utility, it is as trivial as follows:If you run the previous code with this command:Then ops object will be as follows:So you can use it as you want. For instance:Grouped options are also supported, so you can write -om instead of -o -m.Furthermore, stdio can generate a help/usage output automatically. If you call ops.printHelp() you\'ll get the following:The previous message is shown also if a mandatory option is not given (preceded by the error message) or if it is mispecified (for instance, if you specify a single arg for an option and it needs 2).You can install stdio module using NPM:If your script is called myScript.js and you want to pass the first and last name, \'Sean Worthington\', as arguments like below:Then within your script you write:command-line-args is worth a look!You can set options using the main notation standards (getopt, getopt_long, etc.). These commands are all equivalent, setting the same values:To access the values, first describe the options your app accepts (see option definitions).The type property is a setter function (the value supplied is passed through this), giving you full control over the value received.Next, parse the options using commandLineArgs:options now looks like this:When dealing with large amounts of options it often makes sense to group them.A usage guide can be generated using command-line-usage, for example:Notation rules for setting command-line options.Imagine we are using "grep-tool" to search for the string \'-f\':We have an issue here: command-line-args will assume we are setting two options (--search and -f). In actuality, we are passing one option (--search) and one value (-f). In cases like this, avoid ambiguity by using --option=value notation:By default, if the user sets an option without a valid definition an UNKNOWN_OPTION exception is thrown. However, in some cases you may only be interested in a subset of the options wishing to pass the remainder to another library. See here for a example showing where this might be necessary.To enable partial parsing, set partial: true in the method options:Now, should any unknown args be passed at the command line:They will be returned in the _unknown property of the commandLineArgs output with no exceptions thrown:There\'s an app for that. Well, module. Well, more than one, probably hundreds.Yargs is one of the fun ones, its docs are cool to read.Here\'s an example from the github/npm page:Output is here (it reads options with dashes etc, short and long, numeric etc).It\'s probably a good idea to manage your configuration in a centralized manner using something like nconf https://github.com/flatiron/nconfIt helps you work with configuration files, environment variables, command-line arguments.Passing,parsing arguments is an easy process. Node provides you with the process.argv property, which is an array of strings, which are the arguments that were used when Node was invoked. \nThe first entry of the array is the Node executable, and the second entry is the name of your script. If you run script with below atgumentsFile : args.jsYou will get array likeYou can parse all arguments and check if they exist. file: parse-cli-arguments.js:Than just do:--Or something like : --You can reach command line arguments using system.args. And i use the solution below to parse arguments into an object, so i can get which one i want by name.now you don\'t need to know the index of the argument. use it like args.whateverNote: you should use named arguments like file.js x=1 y=2 to use\n  this solution.A simple snippet if any need it:
