I\'ve set up Node.js and Nginx on my server. Now I want to use it, but, before I start there are 2 questions:There are 2 concepts for a Node.js server, which one is better:   a. Create a separate HTTP server for each website that needs it. Then load all JavaScript code at the start of the program, so the code is interpreted once.b. Create one single Node.js server which handles all Node.js requests. This reads the requested files and evals their contents. So the files are interpreted on each request, but the server logic is much simpler.It\'s not clear for me how to use Node.js correctly.Nginx works as a front end server, which in this case proxies the requests to a node.js server. Therefore you need to setup an nginx config file for node.This is what I have done in my Ubuntu box:Create the file yourdomain at /etc/nginx/sites-available/:In it you should have something like: If you want nginx (>= 1.3.13) to handle websocket requests as well, add the following lines in the location / section:Once you have this setup you must enable the site defined in the config file above:Create your node server app at /var/www/yourdomain/app.js and run it at localhost:3000Restart nginx:Lastly start the node server:Now you should see "Hello World" at yourdomain.comOne last note with regards to starting the node server: you should use some kind of monitoring system for the node daemon. There is an awesome tutorial on node with upstart and monit.You can also setup multiple domain with nginx, forwarding to multiple node.js processes.For example to achieve these:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/domain1In /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/domain2You can also have different urls for apps in one server configuration:In /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yourdomain:Restart nginx:Starting applications.node app1.jsnode app2.jsI proxy independent Node Express applications through Nginx.Thus new applications can be easily mounted and I can also run other stuff on the same server at different locations.Here are more details on my setup with Nginx configuration example:Deploy multiple Node applications on one web server in subfolders with NginxThings get tricky with Node when you need to move your application from from localhost to the internet.There is no common approach for Node deployment.Google can find tons of articles on this topic, but I was struggling to find the proper solution for the setup I need.Basically, I have a web server and I want Node applications to be mounted to subfolders (i.e. http://myhost/demo/pet-project/) without introducing any configuration dependency to the application code.At the same time I want other stuff like blog to run on the same web server.Sounds simple huh? Apparently not.In many examples on the web Node applications either run on port 80 or proxied by Nginx to the root.Even though both approaches are valid for certain use cases, they do not meet my simple yet a little bit exotic criteria.That is why I created my own Nginx configuration and here is an extract:From this example you can notice that I mount my Pet Project Node application running on port 3000 to http://myhost/demo/pet-project.First Nginx checks if whether the requested resource is a static file available at /opt/demo/pet-project/public/ and if so it serves it as is that is highly efficient, so we do not need to have a redundant layer like Connect static middleware.Then all other requests are overwritten and proxied to Pet Project Node application, so the Node application does not need to know where it is actually mounted and thus can be moved anywhere purely by configuration.proxy_redirect is a must to handle Location header properly. This is extremely important if you use res.redirect() in your Node application.You can easily replicate this setup for multiple Node applications running on different ports and add more location handlers for other purposes. From: http://skovalyov.blogspot.dk/2012/07/deploy-multiple-node-applications-on.htmlanswering your question 2:I would use option b simply because it consumes much less resources. with option \'a\', every client will cause the server to consume a lot of memory, loading all the files you need (even though i like php, this is one of the problems with it). With option \'b\' you can load your libraries (reusable code) and share them among all client requests.But be ware that if you have multiple cores you should tweak node.js to use all of them.Node.js with Nginx configuration.add the following configuration so that Nginx acting as a proxy redirect to port 3000 traffic from the server when we come from \xe2\x80\x9csubdomain.your_domain.com\xe2\x80\x9dYou could also use node.js to generate static files into a directory served by nginx. Of course, some dynamic parts of your site could be served by node, and some by nginx (static).Having some of them served by nginx increases your performance..I made a repository in Github which you can clone, vagrant-node-nginx-boilerplatebasically the node.js app at /var/www/nodeapp is and the nginx config at /etc/nginx/sites-available/ isWe can easily setup a Nodejs app by Nginx acting as a reverse proxy.\nThe following configuration assumes the NodeJS application is running on 127.0.0.1:8080,in above setup your Nodejs app will,  Your Application must be managed by a process manager like pm2 or supervisor for handling situations/reusing sockets or resources etc.Setup an error reporting service for getting production errors like sentry or rollbarNOTE: you can setup logic for handing domain specific request routes, create a middleware for expressjs application
