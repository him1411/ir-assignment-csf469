I use the following command to push to my remote branch:If I saydoes that push changes in my other branches too, or does it only update my current branch? I have three branches: master, production and sandbox.The git push documentation is not very clear about this, so I\'d like to clarify this for good.Which branches and remotes do the following git push commands update exactly?origin above is a remote.I understand that git push [remote] [branch] will push only that branch to the remote.You can control the default behavior by setting push.default in your git config. From the git-config(1) documentation:Defines the action git push should take if no refspec is given on the command line, no refspec is configured in the remote, and no refspec is implied by any of the options given on the command line. Possible values are:nothing: do not push anythingmatching: push all matching branchesAll branches having the same name in both ends are considered to be matching.This is the default in Git 1.x.upstream: push the current branch to its upstream branch (tracking is a deprecated synonym for upstream)current: push the current branch to a branch of the same namesimple: (new in Git 1.7.11) like upstream, but refuses to push if the upstream branch\'s name is different from the local oneThis is the safest option and is well-suited for beginners.This will become the default in Git 2.0.The simple, current and upstream modes are for those who want to push out a single branch after finishing work, even when the other branches are not yet ready to be pushed outCommand line examples:To view the current configuration:To set a new configuration:git push origin will push all changes on the local branches that have matching remote branches at origin As for git push Works like git push <remote>, where <remote> is the current branch\'s remote (or origin, if no remote is configured for the current branch). From the Examples section of the git-push man pageYou can set up default behavior for your git with push.defaultor if you have many repositories and want the same for all thenThe current in this setup means that by default you will only push the current branch when you do git pushOther options are:UPDATE - NEW WAY TO DO THISAs of Git 1.7.11 do the following:This is a new setting introduced that works in the same way as current, and will be made default to git from v 2.0 according to rumorsI just committed my code to a branch and pushed it to github, like this:Here is a very handy and helpful information about Git Push: \nGit Push: Just the TipThe most common use of git push is to push your local changes to your public upstream repository. Assuming that the upstream is a remote named "origin" (the default remote name if your repository is a clone) and the branch to be updated to/from is named "master" (the default branch name), this is done with: git push origin mastergit push origin will push changes from all local branches to matching branches the origin remote.git push origin master will push changes from the local master branch to the remote master branch.git push origin master:staging will push changes from the local master branch to the remote staging branch if it exists.(March 2012)\nBeware: that default "matching" policy might change soon\n(sometimes after git1.7.10+):See "Please discuss: what "git push" should do when you do not say what to push?"In the current setting (i.e. push.default=matching), git push without argument will push all branches that exist locally and remotely with the same name.\n  This is usually appropriate when a developer pushes to his own public repository, but may be confusing if not dangerous when using a shared repository. The proposal is to change the default to \'upstream\', i.e. push only the current branch, and push it to the branch git pull would pull from.\n  Another candidate is \'current\'; this pushes only the current branch to the remote branch of the same name.What has been discussed so far can be seen in this thread:http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/192547/focus=192694Previous relevant discussions include:To join the discussion, send your messages to: git@vger.kernel.orgI just put this in my .gitconfig aliases section and love how it works:Will push the current branch to origin with git pub or another repo with git pub repo-name. Tasty.A git push will try and push all local branches to the remote server, this is likely what you do not want. I have a couple of conveniences setup to deal with this:Alias "gpull" and "gpush" appropriately:In my ~/.bash_profileThus, executing "gpush" or "gpull" will push just my "currently on" branch. You can push current branch with command(took from here)You can change that default behavior in your .gitconfig, for example:To check the current settings, run:Rather than using aliases, I prefer creating git-XXX scripts so I can source control them more easily (our devs all have a certain source controlled dir on their path for this type of thing).This script (called git-setpush) will set the config value for remote.origin.push value to something that will only push the current branch:note, as we\'re using Gerrit, it sets the target to refs/for/XXX to push into a review branch. It also assumes origin is your remote name.Invoke it after checking out a branch withIt could obviously be adapted to also do the checkout, but I like scripts to do one thing and do it wellI have added the following functions into my .bashrc file to automate these tasks. It does git push/git pull + name of current branch.
