What SQL can be used to list the tables, and the rows within those tables in a SQLite database file - once I have attached it with the ATTACH command on the SQLite 3 command line tool?The .tables, and .schema "helper" functions don\'t look into ATTACHed databases: they just query the SQLITE_MASTER table for the "main" database. Consequently, if you usedthen you need to doNote that temporary tables don\'t show up with .tables either: you have to list sqlite_temp_master for that:There are a few steps to see the tables in an SQLite database:List the tables in your database:List how the table looks:Print the entire table:List all of the available SQLite prompt commands:It appears you need to go through the sqlite_master table, like this:And then manually go through each table with a SELECT or similar to look at the rows.The .DUMP and .SCHEMA commands doesn\'t appear to see the database at all.To show all tables, useTo show all rows, I guess you can iterate through all tables and just do a SELECT * on each one. But maybe a DUMP is what you\'re after?Use .help to check for available commands.This command would show all tables under your current database.To list the tables you can also do:There is a command available for this on the SQLite command line:Which converts to the following SQL:Try PRAGMA table_info(table-name);\nhttp://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#schemaAccording to the documentation, the equivalent of MySQLs\' SHOW TABLES; is:The ".tables" command is similar to setting list mode then executing\n  the following query:However, if you are checking if a single table exists (or to get its details), see @LuizGeron answer.As of the latest versions of SQLite 3 you can issue:to see all of your create statements.The easiest way to do this is to open the database directly and use the .dump command, rather than attaching it after invoking the SQLite 3 shell tool.So... (assume your OS command line prompt is $) instead of $sqlite3:From your OS command line, open the database directly:I use this query to get it:And to use in iOS:Use:Via a union all, combine all tables into one list.The ".schema" commando will list available tables and their rows, by showing you the statement used to create said tables:Since nobody has mentioned about the official reference of SQLite, I think it may be useful to refer to it under this heading:https://www.sqlite.org/cli.htmlYou can manipulate your database using the commands described in this link. Besides, if you are using Windows OS and do not know where the command shell is, that is in the SQLite\'s site: https://www.sqlite.org/download.htmlAfter downloading it, click sqlite3.exe file to initialize the SQLite command shell. When it is initialized, by default this SQLite session is using an in-memory database, not a file on disk, and so all changes will be lost when the session exits. To use a persistent disk file as the database, enter the ".open ex1.db" command immediately after the terminal window starts up.The example above causes the database file named "ex1.db" to be opened and used, and created if it does not previously exist. You might want to use a full pathname to ensure that the file is in the directory that you think it is in. Use forward-slashes as the directory separator character. In other words use "c:/work/ex1.db", not "c:\\work\\ex1.db".To see all tables in the database you have previously chosen, type the command .tables as it is said in the above link.If you work in Windows, I think it might be useful to move this sqlite.exe file to same folder with the other Python files. In this way, the Python file writes to and the SQLite shell reads from .db files are in the same path.
