I thought that adding a "value" attribute set on the <select> element below would cause the <option> containing my provided "value" to be selected by default:However, this did not work as I had expected. How can I set which <option> element is selected by default?Set selected="selected" for the option you want to be the default.Complete example:In case you want to have a default text as a sort of placeholder/hint but not considered a valid value (something like "complete here", "select your nation" ecc.) you can do something like this:You can do it like this:Provide "selected" keyword inside the option tag, which you want to appear by default in your drop down list.Or you can also provide attribute to the option tag i.e. I came across this question, but the accepted and highly upvoted answer didn\'t work for me.  It turns out that if you are using React, then setting selected doesn\'t work.Instead you have to set a value in the <select> tag directly as shown below:Read more about why here on the React page.if you want to use the values from a Form and keep it dynamic try this with phpI prefer this:\'Choose here\' disappears after an option has been selected.An improvement for nobita\'s answer. Also you can improve the visual view of the drop down list, by hiding the element \'Choose here\'.Another example; using JavaScript to set a selected option. (You could use this example to for loop an array of values into a drop down component)<select id="yourDropDownElementId"><select/>The selected attribute is a boolean attribute.When present, it specifies that an option should be pre-selected when the page loads.The pre-selected option will be displayed first in the drop-down list.I used this php function to generate the options, and insert it into my HTMLAnd then in my webpage code I use it as below;If $endmin is created from a _POST variable every time the page is loaded (and this code is inside a form which posts) then the previously selected value is selected by default.I added code to set default value for HTML select element with PHP. This selects the default value by giving the var default a value. value attribute of  tag is missing, so it doesn\'t show as u desired selected. By default first option show on dropdown page load, if value attribute is set on  tag.... I got solved my problem this wayI myself use it This is how I did it...
