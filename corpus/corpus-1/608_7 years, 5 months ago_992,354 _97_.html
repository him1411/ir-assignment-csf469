I\'m looking for a HTML or ASCII character which is a triangle pointing up or down so that I can use it as a toggle switch.I found ↑ (&uarr;), and ↓ (&darr;) - but those have a narrow stem. I\'m looking just for the HTML arrow "head".Unicode arrows heads:For \xe2\x96\xb2 and \xe2\x96\xbc use &#x25B2; and &#x25BC; respectively if you cannot include Unicode characters directly (use UTF-8!).Note that the font support for the smaller versions is not as good. Better to use the large versions in smaller font.More Unicode arrows are at:Lastly, these arrows are not ASCII, including \xe2\x86\x91 and \xe2\x86\x93: they are Unicode.For HTML Entities \n◄ = &#9668; \n► = &#9658; \n▼ = &#9660; \n▲ = &#9650;I found this one very handy for a single character column sorter. (Looks good upscaled).&#x21D5; = \xe2\x87\x95IMPORTANT NOTE (When using unicode symbols)Unicode support varies dependant on the symbol of choice, browser and the font family. If you find your chosen symbol does not work in some browsers then try using a different font-family. Microsoft recommend "Segoe UI Symbol" however it would be wise to include the font with your website as not many people have it on their computers. Open this page in other browsers to see which symbols render with the default font.Some more unicode arrows.You can copy them right off the page below or you can use the code.Each row of arrows is numbered from left to right:Simply insert the corresponding number/letter before the closing semi-colon as above.&#x219;&#x21A;&#x21B;&#x21C;&#x21D;&#x21E;&#x21F;Additional HTML unicode symbolsA selected list of other helpful unicode icons/symbols.I recently made an article about creating Chevrons efficiently using only CSS (No Images required).How to simply alter:>>> CLICK FOR DEMO <<<CSS \n(Efficient with Cross browser support) UP/DOWN  DOWN  UPUsing only a few lines of css we can encode our images into base64. >>> CLICK FOR DEMO <<<PROSCONSCSSSorry but they are only in Unicode. :(Big ones:Big white ones:There is also some smalller triangles:Also some white ones:There are also some "pointy" triangles. You can read more here in Wikipedia:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_ShapesBut unfortunately, they are all Unicode instead of ASCII.\nIf you still want to use ASCII, then you can use an image file for it of just use ^ and v. (Just like the Google Maps in the mobile version this was referring to the ancient mobile Google Maps)As others also suggested, you can also create triangles with HTML, either with CSS borders or SVG shapes or even JavaScript canvases.Since you\'re using these arrows for a toggle switch you may want to consider creating these arrows with an html element using the following styles instead of unicode characters.http://jsfiddle.net/FrsGR/How about these Unicode characters?\xcb\x84 \xcb\x85&#x2C4; and &#x2C5; respectively."Not ASCII (neither\'s \xe2\x86\x91/\xe2\x86\x93)" needs qualification.While these characters are not defined in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange as glyphs, their codes WERE commonly used to give a graphical presentation for ASCII codes 24 and 25 (hex 18 and 19, CANcel and EM:End of Medium). Code page 437 (called Extended ASCII by IBM, includes the numeric codes 128 to 255) defined the use of these glyphs as ASCII codes and the ubiquity of these conventions permeated the industry as seen by their deployment as standards by leading companies such as HP, particularly for printers, and IBM, particularly for microcomputers starting with the original PC.Just as the use of the ASCII codes for CAN and EM was relatively obsolete at the time, justifying their use as glyphs, so has the passage of time made the use of the codes as glyphs obsolete by the current use of UNICODE conventions.It should be emphasized that the extensions to ASCII made by IBM in Extended ASCII, included not only a larger numeric set for numeric codes 128 to 255, but also extended the use of some numeric control codes, in the ASCII range 0 to 32, from just media transmission control protocols to include glyphs.  It is often assumed, incorrectly, that the first 0 to 128 were not "extended" and that IBM was using the glyphs of conventional ASCII for this range. This error is also perpetrated in one of the previous references. This error became so pervasive that it colloquially redefined ASCII subliminally.There are several correct ways to display a down-pointing triangle.HTML :HTML :HTML :HTML :CSS :Each of these three methods should have the same output. For other symbols, the same three options exist. Some even have a fourth option, allowing you to use a string based reference (eg. &hearts; to display \xe2\x99\xa5).You can use a reference website like Unicode-table.com to find which icons are supported in UNICODE and which codes they correspond with. For example, you find the values for the down-pointing triangle at http://unicode-table.com/en/25BC/.Note that these methods are sufficient only for icons that are available by default in every browser. For symbols like \xe2\x98\x83,\xe2\x9d\x84,\xe2\x98\x85,\xe2\x98\x82,\xe2\x98\xad,\xe2\x8e\x97 or \xe2\x8e\x98, this is far less likely to be the case. While it is possible to provide cross-browser support for other UNICODE symbols, the procedure is a bit more complicated.If you want to know how to add support for less common UNICODE characters, see Create webfont with Unicode Supplementary Multilingual Plane symbols for more info on how to do this.A totally different strategy is the use of background-images instead of fonts. For optimal performance, it\'s best to embed the image in your CSS file by base-encoding it, as mentioned by eg. @weasel5i2 and @Obsidian. I would recommend the use of SVG rather than GIF, however, is that\'s better both for performance and for the sharpness of your symbols.This following code is the base64 for and SVG version of the  icon :For many use cases, SVG-based background images and icon fonts are largely equivalent with regards to performance and flexibility. To decide which to pick, consider the following differences:SVG imagesIcon fontsPersonally, I would recommend the use of background-images only when you need multiple colors and those color can\'t be achieved by means of color, background-color and other color-related CSS rules for fonts.The main benefit of using SVG images is that you can give different components of a symbol their own styling. If you embed your SVG XML code in the HTML document, this is very similar to styling the HTML. This would, however, result in a web page that uses both HTML tags and SVG tags, which could significantly reduce the readability of a webpage. It also adds extra bloat if the symbol is repeated across multiple pages and you need to consider that old versions of IE have no or limited support for SVG.I know I\'m late to the party but you can accomplish this with plain CSS as well:HTML:(It can be any HTML element, if you\'re using an inline element like a <span> for example, make sure you make it a block/inline-block element with display:block; or display:inline-block):<div class="up"></div>and<div class="down"></div>CSS:You can also accomplish it using :before and :after pseudo-elements, which is actually a better way since you avoid creating extra markup. But that\'s up to you on how you\'d like to accomplish it.--Here\'s a Demo in CodePen with many arrow possibilities.HTML Entities for empty triangles\n◁ = &#9665; \n▷ = &#9655; \n▽ = &#9661; \n△ = &#9651;I think the asker may be referring to one of these (see attached image) - I found this StackOverflow question while searching for the same thing myself.Unfortunately, this glyph doesn\'t seem to exist as a distinct character entity anywhere.  Wikipedia accomplishes it below by using inline javascript and img content="data:image/gif..." to achieve the symbol.Incidentally, here\'s the base64 for it:Hope this helps someone!\n\xe2\x96\xb2\xe2\x96\xbc\nThese are U+25B2 (&#x25B2) and U+25BC (&#x25BC) respectivelyThis one seems to imply that 030 and 031 are up and down triangles.(As bobince pointed out, this doesn\'t seem to be an ASCII standard)I use \xe2\x96\xbc and \xe2\x96\xb2, but they might not work for you.  I use alt 11551 for the first one and 11550 for the second one.  You can always copy paste them if the ascii isnt the same for your system.A lot of people here are suggesting to use the triangles, but sometimes you need a chevron. We had a case where our button shows a chevron, and wanted the user\'s manual to refer to the button in a way which will be recognized by a non-technical user too. So we needed a chevron sign. We used  \xef\xb9\x80 in the end. It is known as PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET and its code is U+FE40.
