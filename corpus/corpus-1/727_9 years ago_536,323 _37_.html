I know how to generally move around in command mode, specifically, jumping to lines, etc. But what is the command to jump to the end of the line that I am currently on?Just the $ (dollar sign) key.  You can use A to move to the end of the line and switch to editing mode (Append).The opposite of A is I (Insert mode at beginning of line), as an aside.As lots of people have said:but also:g _ goes to the last non-whitespace character.g $ goes to the end of the screen line (when a buffer line is wrapped across multiple screen lines)$Checkout this VIM cheat sheetIf your current line wraps around the visible screen onto the next line, you can use g$ to get to the end of the screen line.The main question - end of line$ goes to the end of line, remains in command modeA goes to the end of line, switches to insert modeConversely - start of line (technically the first non-whitespace character)^ goes to the start of line, remains in command modeI (uppercase i) goes to the start of line, switches to insert modeFurther - start of line (technically the first column irrespective of whitespace)0 (zero) goes to the start of line, remains in command mode0i (zero followed by lowercase i) goes the start of line, switches to insert modeFor those starting to learn vi, here is a good introduction to vi by listing side by side vi commands to typical Windows GUI Editor cursor movement and shortcut keys.vi editor for Windows usersThe dollar sign: $The advantage of the \'End\' key is it works in both normal and insert modes.\'$\' works in normal/command mode only but it also works in the classic vi editor (good to know when vim is not available).In many cases, when we are inside a string we are enclosed by a double quote, or while writing a statement we don\'t want to press escape and go to end of that line with arrow key and press the semicolon(;) just to end the line. Write the following line inside your vimrc file:What does the line say? It maps Ctrl+l to a series of commands. It is equivalent to you pressing Esc (command mode), $ (end of line), a (append) at once.Also note the distinction between line (or perhaps physical line) and screen line. A line is terminated by the End Of Line character ("\\n"). A screen line is whatever happens to be shown as one row of characters in your terminal or in your screen. The two come apart if you have physical lines longer than the screen width, which is very common when writing emails and such.The distinction shows up in the end-of-line commands as well.If you always prefer the latter behavior, you can remap the keys like this:Press A to enter edit mode starting at the end of the line.Or there\'s the obvious answer: use the End key to go to the end of the line.Possibly unrelated, but if you want to start a new line after the current line, you can use o anywhere in the line.The easiest option would be to key in $. If you are working with blocks of text, you might appreciate the command { and } in order to move a paragraph back and forward, respectively. I was used to Home/End getting me to the start and end of lines in Insert mode (from use in Windows and I think Linux), which Mac doesn\'t support.  This is particularly annoying because when I\'m using vim on a remote system, I also can\'t easily do it.  After some painful trial and error, I came up with these .vimrc lines which do the same thing, but bound to Ctrl-A for the start of the line and Ctrl-D for the end of the line.  (For some reason, Ctrl-E I guess is reserved or at least I couldn\'t figure a way to bind it.)  Enjoy.There\'s a good chart here for the ASCII control character codes here for others as well:http://www.physics.udel.edu/~watson/scen103/ascii.htmlYou can also do Ctrl-V + Ctrl- as well, but that doesn\'t paste as well to places like this.
