I am trying to select data from a MySQL table, but I get one of the following error messages:mysql_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean givenormysqli_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be mysqli_result, boolean givenThis is my code:The same applies to code like andand and andA query may fail for various reasons in which case both the mysql_* and the mysqli extension will return false from their respective query functions/methods. You need to test for that error condition and handle it accordingly.mysql_* extension:NOTE The mysql_ functions are deprecated and have been removed in php version 7.Check $result before passing it to mysql_fetch_array. You\'ll find that it\'s false because the query failed. See the mysql_query documentation for possible return values and suggestions for how to deal with them.mysqli extension\nprocedural style:oo-style:  using a prepared statement:These examples only illustrate what should be done (error handling), not how to do it. Production code shouldn\'t use or die when outputting HTML, else it will (at the very least) generate invalid HTML. Also, database error messages shouldn\'t be displayed to non-admin users, as it discloses too much information.This error message is displayed when you have an error in your query which caused it to fail. It will manifest itself when using:Note: This error does not appear if no rows are affected by your query. Only a query with an invalid syntax will generate this error.Troubleshooting StepsMake sure you have your development server configured to display all errors. You can do this by placing this at the top of your files or in your config file: error_reporting(-1);. If you have any syntax errors this will point them out to you.Use mysql_error(). mysql_error() will report any errors MySQL encountered while performing your query.Sample usage:Run your query from the MySQL command line or a tool like phpMyAdmin. If you have a syntax error in your query this will tell you what it is.Make sure your quotes are correct. A missing quote around the query or a value can cause a query to fail.Make sure you are escaping your values. Quotes in your query can cause a query to fail (and also leave you  open to SQL injections). Use mysql_real_escape_string() to escape your input.Make sure you are not mixing mysqli_* and mysql_* functions. They are not the same thing and cannot be used together. (If you\'re going to choose one or the other stick with mysqli_*. See below for why.)Other tipsmysql_* functions should not be used for new code. They are no longer maintained and the community has begun the deprecation process.  Instead you should learn about prepared statements and use either PDO or MySQLi. If you can\'t decide, this article will help to choose. If you care to learn, here is good PDO tutorial.Error occurred here was due to the use of single quotes (\'). You can put your query like this:It\'s using mysql_real_escape_string for prevention of SQL injection. \nThough we should use MySQLi or PDO_MYSQL extension for upgraded version of PHP (PHP 5.5.0 and later), but for older versions mysql_real_escape_string will do the trick.As scompt.com explained, the query might fail. Use this code the get the error of the query or the correct result:See the documentation for mysql_query() for further information.The actual error was the single quotes so that the variable $username was not parsed. But you should really use mysql_real_escape_string($username) to avoid SQL injections.Put quotes around $username. String values, as opposed to numeric values, must be enclosed in quotes.Also, there is no point in using the LIKE condition if you\'re not using wildcards: if you need an exact match use = instead of LIKE.Please check once the database selected are not because some times database is not selectedCheck before MySQL query\nand then go to next step Your code should be something like thisOnce done with that, you would get the query printed on the screen. Try this query on your server and see if it produces the desired results. Most of the times the error is in the query. Rest of the code is correct.You define the string using single quotes and PHP does not parse single quote delimited strings. In order to obtain variable interpolation you will need to use double quotes OR string concatenation (or a combination there of). See http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php for more information.Also you should check that mysql_query returned a valid result resource, otherwise fetch_*, num_rows, etc will not work on the result as is not a result! IE:http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-query.php for more information.This query should work:The problem is single quotes, thus your query fails and returns FALSE and your WHILE loop can\'t execute. Using % allows you to match any results containing your string (such as SomeText-$username-SomeText).This is simply an answer to your question, you should implement stuff  mentioned in the other posts: error handling, use escape strings (users can type anything into the field, and you MUST make sure it is not arbitrary code), use PDO instead mysql_connect which is now depricated.Sometimes suppressing the query as @mysql_query(your query);If you tried everything here, and it does not work, you might want to check your MySQL database collation. Mine was set to to a Swedish collation. Then I changed it to utf8_general_ci and everything just clicked into gear.I hope this helps someone.Instead of using a WHERE query, you can use this ORDER BY query. It\'s far better than this for use of a query.I have done this query and am getting no errors like parameter or boolean.Try this, it must be work, otherwise you need to print the error to specify your problemTry the following code. It may work fine.There might be two reasons:Have you opened the connection to the database prior to calling mysql_query function? I don\'t see that in your code. Use mysql_connect before making the query. See php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-connect.phpThe variable $username is used inside a single quote string, so its value will not be evaluated inside the query. The query will definitely fail.Thirdly, the structure of query is prone to SQL injection. You may use prepared statements to avoid this security threat.And if there is a user with a unique user name, you can use "=" for that. There is no need to like.Your query will be:Go to your config.php. I had the same problem. Verify the username and the password, and also sql select is the same name as the config.Include a connection string variable before the MySQL query. For example, $connt in this code:Don\'t use the depricated mysql_* function (depricated in php 5.5 will be removed in php 7). and you can make this with mysqli or pdohere is the complete select query Try ThisFirst, check your connection to the database. Is it connected successfully or not?If it\'s done, then after that I have written this code, and it works well:Make Sure You\'re Not Closing Database By using db_close() Before To\n  Running Your Query:If you\'re using multiple queries in a script even you\'re including other pages which contains queries or database connection, then it might be possible that at any place you use db_close() that would close your database connection so make sure you\'re not doing this mistake in your scripts.Any time you get the..."Warning: mysqli_fetch_object() expects parameter 1 to be mysqli_result, boolean given"...it is likely because there is an issue with your query. The prepare() or query() might return FALSE (a Boolean), but this generic failure message doesn\'t leave you much in the way of clues. How do you find out what is wrong with your query? You ask!First of all, make sure error reporting is turned on and visible: add these two lines to the top of your file(s) right after your opening <?php tag:If your error reporting has been set in the php.ini you won\'t have to worry about this. Just make sure you handle errors gracefully and never reveal the true cause of any issues to your users. Revealing the true cause to the public can be a gold engraved invitation for those wanting to harm your sites and servers. If you do not want to send errors to the browser you can always monitor your web server error logs. Log locations will vary from server to server e.g., on Ubuntu the error log is typically located at /var/log/apache2/error.log. If you\'re examining error logs in a Linux environment you can use tail -f /path/to/log in a console window to see errors as they occur in real-time....or as you make them.Once you\'re squared away on standard error reporting adding error checking on your database connection and queries will give you much more detail about the problems going on. Have a look at this example where the column name is incorrect. First, the code which returns the generic fatal error message:The error is generic and not very helpful to you in solving what is going on.With a couple of more lines of code you can get very detailed information which you can use to solve the issue immediately. Check the prepare() statement for truthiness and if it is good you can proceed on to binding and executing.If something is wrong you can spit out an error message which takes you directly to the issue. In this case there is no foo column in the table, solving the problem is trivial.If you choose, you can include this checking in a function or class and extend it by handling the errors gracefully as mentioned previously.Check your connection first.Then if you want to fetch the exact value from the database then you should write:Or you want to fetch the LIKE type of value then you should write:If you don\'t have any MySQL Error appearing while checking, make sure that you properly created your database table. This happened to me. Look for any unwanted commas or quotes. You can also check  wether $result is failing like so, before executing the fetch array  Usually an error occurs when your database conectivity fails, so be sure to connect your database or to include the database file.ORTry this code it work fine assign the post  variable to the variable      You can try this code. I found it earlier when I was encountered a problem similar to yours.
