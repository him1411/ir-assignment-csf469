I\'ve got a nested loop construct like this:Now how can I break out of both loops. I\'ve looked at similar questions, but none concerns Java specifically. I couldn\'t apply these solutions because most used gotos.I don\'t want to put the inner loop in a different method.Update: I don\'t want to rerun the loops, when breaking I\'m finished with the execution of the loop block.(EDIT: Like other answerers, I\'d definitely prefer to put the inner loop in a different method. This answer just shows how the requirements in the question can be met.)You can use break with a label for the outer loop. For example:This prints:Technically the correct answer is to label the outer loop. In practice if you want to exit at any point inside an inner loop then you would be better off externalizing the code into a method (a static method if needs be) and then call it.That would pay off for readability. The code would become something like that: Matching the example for the accepted answer:You can use a named block around the loops:I never use labels. It seems like a bad practice to get into. Here\'s what I would do:You can use labels:maybe with a function?You can use a temporary variable:Depending on your function, you can also exit/return from the inner loop:If you don\'t like breaks and gotos, you can use a "traditional" for loop instead the for-in, with an extra abort condition:I needed to do a similar thing, but I chose not to use the enhanced for loop to do it.I prefer to add an explicit "exit" to the loop tests.  It makes it clear to \nany casual reader that the loop may terminate early.You can break from all loops without using any label: and flags.It\'s just tricky solution.Here condition1 is the condition which is used to break from loop K and J.\nAnd condition2 is the condition which is used to break from loop K , J and I.For example:Java 8 Stream solution:Like @1800 INFORMATION suggestion, use the condition that breaks the inner loop as a condition on the outer loop:Another one solution, mentioned without example (it actually works in prod code).Of course break exception should be internal, private and accelerated with no-stack-trace:Rather unusual approach but in terms of code length (not performance) this is the easiest thing you could do:Best and Easy Method..Rather for a long I was thinking to share this type of answer for this type of question. Usually such cases are come in scope of a more meaningful logic, let\'s say some searching or manipulating over some of the iterated \'for\'-objects in question, so I usually use the functional approach:Major cons:The pros: So it is just handling the case via a different approach.Basically a question to the author of this question: what do you consider of this approach? Use Labels.Refer this article\nhttp://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/05/break-continue-and-lablel-in-loop-java.htmlEven creating a flag for outer loop and checking that after each execution of inner loop can be the answer.Like this :If it is inside some function why don\'t you just return it: for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) //inner loop should be replaced with \n    for (int j = 0; j < 5 && !exitloops; j++).Here, in this case complete nested loops should be exit if condition is True . But if we use  exitloops only to the upper loop Then inner loop will continues, because there is no extra flag that notify this inner loop to exit. Example : if i = 3 and j=2 then condition is false.  But in next iteration of inner loop j=3  then condition (i*j) become 9 which is true but inner loop will be continue till j become 5.So, it must use exitloops to the inner loops too.For some cases, We can use while loop effectively here.I wanted to answer this question but was marked as a duplicate which prevents me from posting as well. So posting it here instead !If its a new implementation you can try re-writing the logic as\n  if-else_if-else statements.Otherwise you can try setting a flag when that special condition has\n  occured and check for that flag in each of your loop-conditions.If you are simply porting the logic from one programming language to java and just want to get the thing working you can try using labels Demo for break continue lable,\nso java keyword "break continue" have default value,it\'s the "Nearest Loop" ,Toady a few years after use Java ,i just get it !it\'s seem used rare,but usefulYou can do one thing1.) set a local variable to false2.) set that variable true in first loop , when you want to break out3.) then you can check in outer loop ,that whether the condition is set then break from outer loop as well.Well it quite seemed a simple way for me to put it like this.You just use label for breaking inner loopsCheck if the inner loop is exited with an if statement, by checking the inner loop\'s variable. You could also create another variable such as a boolean to check if the inner loop is exited. In this example it uses the inner loop\'s variable to check if it has been exited:Use condition as a flag for when you are done processing. Then the inner loop only continues on while the condition has not been met. Either way the outer loop will keep on chuggin\'. I feel using labels makes the code seem very much like a goto statement. This is just a thought. Why don\'t we throw an exception at the inner for loop and encapsulate the two for loops with a try catch block. Something likeJust a thought. I prefer this code since it gives me better loggability (Like that\'s a word) for me when this is being run in production or something.
