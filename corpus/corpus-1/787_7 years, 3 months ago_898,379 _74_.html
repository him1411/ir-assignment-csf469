Is there a way to disable the same origin policy on Google\'s Chrome browser?This is strictly for development, not production, use.Close chrome (or chromium) and restart with the --disable-web-security argument. I just tested this and verified that I can access the contents of an iframe with src="http://google.com" embedded in a page served from "localhost" (tested under chromium 5 / ubuntu). For me the exact command was:Note  :  Kill all chrome instances before running commandThe browser will warn you that "you are using an unsupported command line" when it first opens, which you can ignore.From the chromium source:Before Chrome 48, you could just use:Yep. For OSX, open Terminal and run:--user-data-dir required on Chrome 49+ on OSXFor Linux run:Also if you\'re trying to access local files for dev purposes like AJAX or JSON, you can use this flag too.For Windows go into the command prompt and go into the folder where Chrome.exe is and typeThat should disable the same origin policy and allow you to access local files.Update: For Chrome 22+ you will be presented with an error message that says:You are using an unsupported command-line flag: --disable-web-security. Stability and security will suffer.However you can just ignore that message while developing.For Windows users:The problem with the solution accepted here, in my opinion is that if you already have Chrome open and try to run this it won\'t work. However, when researching this, I came across a post on SuperÂ User, Is it possible to run Chrome with and without web security at the same time?.Basically, by running the following command (or creating a shortcut with it and opening Chrome through that)you can open a new "unsecure" instance of Chrome at the same time as you keep your other "secure" browser instances open and working as normal.I didn\'t want to restart Chrome and disable my web security (because I was browsing while developing) and stumbled onto this Chrome extension.Chrome Web Store Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: * (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en)Basically it\'s a little toggle switch to toggle on and off the Allow-Access-Origin-Control check. Works perfectly for me for what I\'m doing.EDIT: I tried using the just the other day for another project and it stopped working. Uninstalling and reinstalling the extension fixed it (to reset the defaults).For Windows... create a Chrome shortcut on your desktop.\nRight-clic > properties > Shortcut\nEdit "target" path :  et voil\xc3\xa0 :)Seems none of above solutions are actually working. The --disable-web-security is no longer supported in recent chrome versions. Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: * - chrome extension partially solved the problem. It works only if your request is using GET method and there\'s no custom HTTP Header. Otherwise, chrome will send OPTIONS http request as pre-flight request. If the server doesn\'t support CORS, it will response with 404 HTTP status code. The plugin can\'t modify the response HTTP status code. So chrome will reject this request. There\'s no way for chrome plugin to modify the response HTTP status code based on current chrome extension API. And you can\'t do a redirect as well for XHR initiated request.Not sure why Chrome makes developers life so difficult. It blocks all the possible ways to disable XSS security check even for development use which is totally un-necessary.After days struggle and research, one solution works perfect for me: to use corsproxy. You have two options here: \n1. use corsproxy.com\n2. install corsproxy in local box: npm install -g corsproxyFor Windows:Execute the following command:For Mac:Execute the following command:A new web security disabled chrome browser should open with the following message:I find the best way to do this is duplicate a Chrome or Chrome Canary shortcut on your windows desktop. Rename this shortcut to "NO CORS" then edit the properties of that shortcut. in the target add --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="D:/Chrome" to the end of the target path. your target should look something like this:Update: New Flags added.For Selenium Webdriver, you can have selenium start Chrome with the appropriate arguments (or "switches") in this case.If you are using Google Chrome on Linux, following command works.This Chrome plugin works for me:\nAllow-Control-Allow-Origin: * - Chrome Web StoreFor windows users with Chrome Version 60.0.3112.78. You do not need to close any chrome instance.BEWARE NOT TO USE THIS PARTICULAR BROWSER INSTANCE FOR BROWSING!You can use this chrome plugin called "Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *" ... It make it a dead simple and work very well.\ncheck it here: *You can simply use this chrome extension Allow-Control-Allow-Originjust click the icon of the extensnion to turn enable cross-resource sharing  ON or OFF as you want Following on Ola Karlsson answer, indeed the best way would be to open the unsafe Chrome in a different session. This way you don\'t need to worry about closing all of the currently opened tabs, and also can continue to surf the web securely with the original Chrome session.These batch files should just work for you on Windows.Put it in a Chrome_CORS.bat file for easy useThis one is for Chrome Canary. Canary_CORS.batfor mac users:and before Chrome 48, you could just use:On Windows 10, the following will work.There is a Chrome extension called CORS Toggle.Click here to access it and add it to Chrome.After adding it, toggle it to the on position to allow cross-domain requests.Don\'t do this! You\'re opening your accounts to attacks. Once you do this any 3rd party site can start issuing requests to other websites, sites that you are logged into.Instead run a local server. It\'s as easy as opening a shell/terminal/commandline and typingThen pointing your browser toIf you find it\'s too slow consider this solutionFor Windows:(using windows 8.1, chrome 44.0) First, close google chrome.Then, open command prompt and go to the folder where \'chrome.exe\' is.So I type: \n    cd C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application )now type: chrome.exe --disable-web-securitya new window of chrome will open.FOR MAC USER ONLY On a Windows PC, use an older version of Chrome and the command will work for all you guys. \nI downgraded my Chrome to 26 version and it worked.
