Recently, I have been asked to cherry pick a commit. But I have no idea what it means. So what does cherry picking a commit in git mean? How do you do it? Cherry picking in git means to choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another. This is in contrast with other ways such as merge and rebase which normally applies many commits onto a another branch.Make sure you are on the branch you want apply the commit to.git checkout masterExecute the following:git cherry-pick <commit-hash>Additional links:Cherry picking in Git is designed to apply some commit from one branch into another branch. It can be done if you eg. made a mistake and committed a change into wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. You can just eg. revert the commit and cherry-pick it on another branch.To use it, you just need git cherry-pick hash, where hash is a commit hash from other branch.For full procedure see: http://technosophos.com/2009/12/04/git-cherry-picking-move-small-code-patches-across-branches.htmlThis quote is taken from;\nVersion Control with Git\n(Really great book, I encourage you to buy it if you are interested in git)Using git cherry-pick The command  git cherry-pick commit applies the\n  changes introduced by the named commit on the current branch. It will\n  introduce a new, distinct commit. Strictly speaking, using  git\n  cherry-pick doesn\xe2\x80\x99t alter the existing history within a repository;\n  instead, it adds to the history. As with other Git operations that\n  introduce changes via the process of applying a diff, you may need to\n  resolve conflicts to fully apply the changes from the given  commit .\n  The command  git cherry-pick is typically used to introduce particular\n  commits from one branch within a repository onto a different branch. A\n  common use is to forward- or back-port commits from a maintenance\n  branch to a development branch. before:\nafter:\nHere is a graphical way hopefully it can help people to understand cherry-pick better:Git cherry pick graphical explainationcherry-pick is a GIT feature. If someone wants to Commit same commits in one branch to target branch then cherry-pick is used.\n        git cherry-pick \nsteps are as below.Here commit id is activity id of another branch.Eg.Visit https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pickYou can think if a cherry pick as similar to a rebase, or rather it\'s managed like a rebase. By this I mean that it takes an existing commit and regenerates it taking as the starting point the head of the branch your currently on.A rebase takes a commit that had a parent X and regenerates the commit as if it actually had a parent Y, and this is precisely what a cherry pick does.Cherry pick is more about how you select the commits, with pull (rebase) it implicitly regenerates your local commits on top of what\'s pulled to your branch but with cherry pick you explicitly choose some commit(s) and implicitly regenerate it(them) on top of your current branch.So the way you do it differs but under the hood they are very similar operations - the regeneration of commits.It\'s kind of copy (from somewhere) and Paste(to somewhere).\nIf you want to do hot fix(suppose), then you can take help of cherry-pick feature. Do cherry-pick in develop branch and merge that commit to release and similar way do cherry-pick from release to master.Voila
