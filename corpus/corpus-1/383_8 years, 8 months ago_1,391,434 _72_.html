In Java, arrays don\'t override toString(), so if you try to print one directly, you get weird output including the memory location:But usually we\'d actually want something more like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. What\'s the simplest way of doing that? Here are some example inputs and outputs:Since Java 5 you can use Arrays.toString(arr) or Arrays.deepToString(arr) for arrays within arrays. Note that the Object[] version calls .toString() on each object in the array. The output is even decorated in the exact way you\'re asking.Examples:Output:Output:Output:Output:Always check the standard libraries first.  Try:or if your array contains other arrays as elements:This is nice to know, however, as for "always check the standard libraries first" I\'d never have stumbled upon the trick of Arrays.toString( myarray )--since I was concentrating on the type of myarray to see how to do this. I didn\'t want to have to iterate through the thing: I wanted an easy call to make it come out similar to what I see in the Eclipse debugger and myarray.toString() just wasn\'t doing it.In JDK1.8 you can use aggregate operations and a lambda expression:If you\'re using Java 1.4, you can instead do:(This works in 1.5+ too, of course.)Starting with Java 8, one could also take advantage of the join() method provided by the String class to print out array elements, without the brackets, and separated by a delimiter of choice (which is the space character for the example shown below):The output will be "Hey there amigo!".Arrays.deepToString(arr) only prints on one line. To actually get a table to print as a two dimensional table, I had to do this: It seems like the Arrays.deepToString(arr) method should take a separator string, but unfortunately it doesn\'t.As a direct answer, the solution provided by several, including @Esko, using the Arrays.toString and Arrays.deepToString methods, is simply the best.Below I try to list some of the other methods suggested, attempting to improve a little, with the most notable addition being the use of the Stream.collect operator, using a joining Collector, to mimic what the String.join is doing.Prior to Java 8 we could have used Arrays.toString(array) to print one dimensional array and Arrays.deepToString(array) for multi-dimensional arrays. We have got the option of Stream and lambda in Java 8 which can also be used for the printing the array.Printing One dimensional Array:The output is:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n  [John, Mary, Bob]\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  John\n  Mary\n  BobPrinting Multi-dimensional Array\nJust in case we want to print multi-dimensional array we can use Arrays.deepToString(array) as:Now the point to observe is that the method Arrays.stream(T[]), which in case of int[] returns us Stream<int[]> and then method flatMapToInt() maps each element of stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element.The output is:[[11, 12], [21, 22], [31, 32, 33]]\n  [[John, Bravo], [Mary, Lee], [Bob, Johnson]]\n  11\n  12\n  21\n  22\n  31\n  32\n  33\n  John\n  Bravo\n  Mary\n  Lee\n  Bob\n  JohnsonUsing regular for loop is the simplest way of printing array in my opinion.\nHere you have a sample code based on your intArrayIt gives output as yours\n    1, 2, 3, 4, 5Different Ways to Print Arrays in Java:Simple Way   Output:\n      [One, Two, Three, Four]Using toString()Output: [One, Two, Three, Four]Printing Array of ArraysOutput: [[Ljava.lang.String;@1ad086a [[Ljava.lang.String;@10385c1,\n  [Ljava.lang.String;@42719c] [[Fifth, Sixth], [Seventh, Eighth]]Resource: Access An ArrayThere\'s one additional way if your array is of type char[]:prints A simplified shortcut I\'ve tried is this:It will printNo loops required in this approach and it is best for small arrays onlyI came across this post in Vanilla #Java recently. It\'s not very convenient writing Arrays.toString(arr);, then importing java.util.Arrays; all the time.Please note, this is not a permanent fix by any means. Just a hack that can make debugging simpler. Printing an array directly gives the internal representation and the hashCode. Now, all classes have Object as the parent-type. So, why not hack the Object.toString()? Without modification, the Object class looks like this:What if this is changed to:This modded class may simply be added to the class path by adding the following to the command line: -Xbootclasspath/p:target/classes.Now, with the availability of deepToString(..) since Java 5, the toString(..) can easily be changed to deepToString(..) to add support for arrays that contain other arrays.I found this to be a quite useful hack and it would be great if Java could simply add this. I understand potential issues with having very large arrays since the string representations could be problematic. Maybe pass something like a System.outor a PrintWriter for such eventualities. It should always work whichever JDK version you use:It will work if the Array contains Objects. If the Array contains primitive types, you can use wrapper classes instead storing the primitive directly as..Example: Replace it with:Update :Yes ! this is to be mention that converting an array to an object array OR to use the Object\'s array is costly and may slow the execution. it happens by the nature of java called autoboxing.   So only for printing purpose, It should not be used. we can make a function which takes an array as parameter and prints the desired format asTo add to all the answers, printing the object as a JSON string is also an option.Using Jackson:Using Gson:Using org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.join(*) methods can be an option\nFor example:I used the following dependency You could loop through the array,  printing out each item, as you loop. For example:Output:In java 8 it is easy. there are two keywordsmethod reference: ::printlnIf you want to print all elements in the array in the same line, then just use print instead of println i.e. Another way without method reference just use:for each loop can also be used to print elements of array:The simplest way to print an array is to use a for-loop:
