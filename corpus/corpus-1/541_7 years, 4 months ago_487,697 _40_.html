How can I check if a string (NSString) contains another smaller string?I was hoping for something like:But the closest I could find was:Anyway, is that the best way to find if a string contains another string?The key is noticing that rangeOfString: returns an NSRange struct, and the documentation says that it returns the struct {NSNotFound, 0} if the "haystack" does not contain the "needle".And if you\'re on iOS 8 or OS X Yosemite, you can now do: (*NOTE: This WILL crash your app if this code is called on an iOS7 device).\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d NOTE: This answer is now obsoleteCreate a category for NSString:EDIT: Observe Daniel Galasko\'s comment below regarding naming Since this seems to be a high-ranking result in Google, I want to add this:iOS 8 and OS X 10.10 add the containsString: method to NSString. An updated version of Dave DeLong\'s example for those systems://You can alternatively use following too :With iOS 8 and Swift, we can use localizedCaseInsensitiveContainsString  method  So personally I really hate NSNotFound but understand its necessity.But some people may not understand the complexities of comparing against NSNotFoundFor example, this code:has its problems:1) Obviously if otherString = nil this code will crash.  a simple test would be:results in  !! CRASH !!2) What is not so obvious to someone new to objective-c is that the same code will NOT crash when string = nil. \nFor example, this code:and this code:will both result inWhich is clearly NOT what you want.So the better solution that I believe works is to use the fact that rangeOfString returns the length of 0  so then a better more reliable code is this:OR SIMPLY:which will for cases  1 and 2 will returnThat\'s my 2 cents ;-)Please check out my Gist for more helpful code.An improved version of P i\'s solution, a category on NSString, that not only will tell, if a string is found within another string, but also takes a range by reference, is:Use it like:Here is a copy-and-paste function snippet:Oneliner (Smaller amount of code. DRY, as you have only one NSLog): \ntry this,If you need this once write:In case of swift, this can be used Best solution. As simple as this! If you want to find a word or \npart of the string. You can use this code. In this example we are going to check if the value of word contains "acter".If do not bother about case-sensitive string.\n Try this once.Please use this codeIf certain position of the string is needed, this code comes to place in Swift 3.0:
