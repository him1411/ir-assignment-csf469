How do you append to the file instead of overwriting it? Is there a special function that appends to the file?You need to open the file in append mode, by setting "a" or "ab" as the mode. See open().When you open with "a" mode, the write position will always be at the end of the file (an append). You can open with "a+" to allow reading, seek backwards and read (but all writes will still be at the end of the file!).Example:Note: Using \'a\' is not the same as opening with \'w\' and seeking to the end of the file - consider what might happen if another program opened the file and started writing between the seek and the write. On some operating systems, opening the file with \'a\' guarantees that all your following writes will be appended atomically to the end of the file (even as the file grows by other writes).A few more details about how the "a" mode operates (tested on Linux only). Even if you seek back, every write will append to the end of the file:In fact, the fopen manpage states:Opening a file in append mode (a as the first character of mode)\n  causes all subsequent write operations to this stream to occur at\n  end-of-file, as if preceded the call:Example: (in a real program use with to close the file - see the documentation)You probably want to pass "a" as the mode argument.  See the docs for open().There are other permutations of the mode argument for updating (+), truncating (w) and binary (b) mode but starting with just "a" is your best bet.I always do this,It\'s simple, but very useful.when we using this line open(filename, "a"), that a indicates the appending the file, that means allow to insert extra data to the existing file.You can just use this following lines to append the text in your fileHere\'s my script, which basically counts the number of lines, then appends, then counts them again so you have evidence it worked. Suppose you have a file biki.txt, which contains:Let\'s say you want this in newline format and save to another file, say new.txt:Here is how to do it:
