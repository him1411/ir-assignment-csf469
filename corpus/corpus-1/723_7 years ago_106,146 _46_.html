JavaScript syntax 101. Here is a function declaration:Note that there\'s no semicolon: this is just a function declaration. You would need an invocation, foo(), to actually run the function.Now, when we add the seemingly innocuous exclamation mark: !function foo() {} it turns it into an expression. It is now a function expression.The ! alone doesn\'t invoke the function, of course, but we can now put () at the end: !function foo() {}() which has higher precedence than ! and instantly calls the function.So what the author is doing is saving a byte per function expression; a more readable way of writing it would be this:Lastly, ! makes the expression return true. This is because by default all IIFE return undefined, which leaves us with !undefined which is true. Not particularly useful.The function:returns nothing (or undefined). Sometimes we want to call a function right as we create it. You might be tempted to try this:but it results in a SyntaxError.Using the ! operator before the function causes it to be treated as an expression, so we can call it:This will also return the boolean opposite of the return value of the function, in this case true, because !undefined is true. If you want the actual return value to be the result of the call, then try doing it this way:There is good point for using ! for function invocation marked on airbnb JavaScript guideGenerally idea for using this technique on separate files (aka modules) which later get concatenated. Caveat here is that files supposed to be concatenated by tools which put new file at new line (which is anyway common behavior for most of concat tools). In that case using ! will help to avoid error in if previously concatenated module missed trailing semicolon, and yet that will give flexibility to put them in any order with no worry.Will work same asbut saves two characters and arbitrary looks better.And by the way any of +,-,~,void operators have same effect, in terms of invoking function, for sure if you have use something to return from that function they would act differently.but if you using IIFE patterns for one file one module code separation and using concat tool for optimization (which makes one line one file job), than constructionWill do safe code execution, same as a very first code sample. This one will throw error cause JavaScript ASI will not be able to do its work.One note regarding unary operators, they would do similar work, but only in case they used not in the first module. So they are not so safe if you do not have total control over the concatenation order.This works:This not:It returns whether the statement can evaluate to false. eg:You can use it twice to coerce a value to boolean:So, to more directly answer your question:Edit: It has the side effect of changing the function declaration to a function expression.  E.g. the following code is not valid because it is interpreted as a function declaration that is missing the required identifier (or function name):And here\'s something more I figured out from the console. As mentioned earlier, the exclamation mark makes the function return a boolean.For the latter one of the syntax:We can do something like:Like a simultaneous function definition and call.Edit:\nNow you would ask what\'s the use of \'!\' type function definition. Let\'s consider the following:you would want to execute a function like above, but without a \'!\' would generate an error. Hope I\'m clear.Its another way of writing IIFE (immediately-invoked function expression).Its other way of writing -same as ! is a logical NOT operator, it\'s a boolean operator that will invert something to its opposite. Although you can bypass the parentheses of the invoked function by using the BANG (!) before the function, it will still invert the return, which might not be what you wanted. As in the case of an IEFE, it would return undefined, which when inverted becomes the boolean true.Instead, use the closing parenthesis and the BANG (!) if needed. Other Operators that work...Combined Operators...Its just to save a byte of data when we do javascript minification.consider the below anonymous functionTo make the above as self invoking function we will generally change the above code asNow we added two extra characters (,) apart from adding () at the end of the function which necessary to call the function.In the process of minification we generally focus to reduce the file size.So we can also write the above function asStill both are self invoking functions and we save a byte as well.Instead of 2 characters (,) we just used one character !
