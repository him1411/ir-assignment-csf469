How do I perform an IF...THEN in an SQL SELECT statement?For example:The CASE statement is the closest to IF in SQL and is supported on all versions of SQL ServerYou only need to do the CAST if you want the result as a boolean value, if you are happy with an int, this works: CASE statements can be embedded in other CASE statements and even included in aggregates. SQL Server Denali (SQL Server 2012) adds the IIF statement which is also available in access: (pointed out by Martin Smith)The case statement is your friend in this situation, and takes one of two forms:The simple case:The extended case:You can even put case statements in an order by clause for really fancy ordering.From SQL Server 2012 you can use the IIF function for this.This is effectively just a shorthand (albeit not standard SQL) way of writing CASE. I prefer the conciseness when compared with the expanded CASE version.Both IIF() and CASE resolve as expressions within a SQL Statement and can only be used in well defined places. The CASE expression cannot be used to control the flow of execution of\n  Transact-SQL statements, statement blocks, user-defined functions, and\n  stored procedures.If your needs can not be satisfied by these limitations (for example a need to return differently shaped result sets dependant on some condition) then SQL Server does also have a procedural IF Keyword.Care must sometimes be taken to avoid parameter sniffing issues with this approach however.Use CASE.  Something like this.You can find some nice examples in The Power of SQL CASE Statements, and I think the statement that you can use will be something like this (from 4guysfromrolla):  Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)In a select use:In a where clause, use:From this link, we can uderstand IF THEN ELSE in T-SQL :Isn\'t this good enough for T-SQL ?Simple if-else statement in SQLÂ Server:Nested If...else statement in sql server -Use pure bit logic:See working demo: IF THEN WITHOUT CASE IN MSSQLFor start, you need to work out the value of true and false for selected conditions. Here comes two NULLIF:combined together gives 1 or 0. Next use bitwise operators.It\'s the most WYSIWYG method.Use a CASE statement:A new feature, IFF (that we can simply use), was added in SQL Server 2012:If you\'re inserting results into a table for the first time, rather than transferring results from one table to another, this works in Oracle 11.2g:This isn\'t an answer, just an example of a CASE statement in use where I work. It has a nested CASE statement. Now you know why my eyes are crossed. For those who uses SQL Server 2012, IIF is a feature that has been added and works as an alternative to Case statements.use this if you want to compare more than one date
