When using git log, how can I filter by user so that I see only commits from that user?This works for both git log and gitk - the 2 most common ways of viewing history. You don\'t need to use the whole name.will match a commit made by "Jonathan Smith"andwould also work. The quotes are optional if you don\'t need any spaces.Add --all if you intend to search all branches and not just the current commit\'s ancestors in your repo.You can also easily match on multiple authors as regex is the underlying mechanism for this filter. So to list commits by Jonathan or Adam, you can do this:In order to exclude commits by a particular author or set of authors using regular expressions as noted in this question, you can use a negative lookahead in combination with the --perl-regexp switch:Alternatively, you can exclude commits authored by Adam by using bash and piping:If you want to exclude commits commited (but not necessarily authored) by Adam, replace %an with %cn. More details about this are in my blog post here: http://dymitruk.com/blog/2012/07/18/filtering-by-author-name/On github there is also a secret way...You can filter commits by author in the commit view by appending param ?author=github_handle. For example, the link https://github.com/dynjs/dynjs/commits/master?author=jingweno shows a list of commits to the Dynjs projectgives you the manpage of git log. Search for "author" there by pressing / and then typing "author", followed by Enter. Type "n" a few times to get to the relevant section, which reveals: as already suggested.Note that this will give you the author of the commits, but in Git, the author can be someone different from the committer (for example in Linux kernel, if you submit a patch as an ordinary user, it might be committed by another administrative user.) See Difference between author and committer in Git? for more details)Most of the time, what one refers to as the user is both the committer and the author though.This gives your commits in text format.You can even abbreviate this a bit by simply using part of the user name:To pull more details - (Here %an refers to author)Use this :-If you want to filter your own commits:try this tool \nhttps://github.com/kamranahmedse/git-standupBelow is the description for each of the flagsIf using GitHub:it will show list in below format I created this little snippet in my .bashrc file.To show the last 10 commits by Frank:  l 10 frank To show the last 20 commits: l 20Since the other question was (possibly wrongfully so?) locked, I will just put this here:show authors with their commit counts: find all commits for specific USERNAME:
