I created a local branch which I want to \'push\' upstream. There is a similar question here on Stack Overflow on how to track a newly created remote branch. However, my workflow is slightly different. First I want to create a local branch, and I will only push it upstream when I\'m satisfied and want to share my branch.UPDATE With Git 2.0 there is a simpler answer I have written below: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27185855/109305First, you create your branch locally:The remote branch is automatically created when you push it to the remote server. So when you feel ready for it, you can just do:Where <remote-name> is typically origin, the name which git gives to the remote you cloned from. Your colleagues would then just pull that branch, and it\'s automatically created locally.Note however that formally, the format is:But when you omit one, it assumes both branch names are the same. Having said this, as a word of caution, do not make the critical mistake of specifying only :<remote-branch-name> (with the colon), or the remote branch will be deleted!So that a subsequent git pull will know what to do, you might instead want to use:As described below, the --set-upstream option sets up an upstream branch:For every branch that is up to date or\n  successfully pushed, add upstream\n  (tracking) reference, used by\n  argument-less git-pull(1) and other\n  commands.First, you must create your branch locallyAfter that, you can work locally in your branch, when you are ready to share the branch, push it. The next command push the branch to the remote repository origin and tracks itTeammates can reach your branch, by doing:You can continue working in the branch and pushing whenever you want without passing arguments to git push (argumentless git push will push the master to remote master, your_branch local to remote your_branch, etc...)Teammates can push to your branch by doing commits and then push explicitlyOr tracking the branch to avoid the arguments to git pushAs of Git 2.0 the behaviour has become simpler: You can configure git with push.default = current to make life easier:I added this so now I can just push a new branch upstream with-u will track remote branch of same name. No with this configuration you will auto-guess the remote reference to git push. From git.config documentation:push.default Defines the action git push should take if no refspec is explicitly given.push.default = current - push the current branch to update a branch with the \n  same name on the receiving end. Works in both central and non-central workflows.For me, this is a good simplification of my day-to-day Git workflow. The configuration setting takes care of the \'usual\' use case where you add a branch locally and want to create it remotely. Also, I can just as easily create local branches from remotes by just doing git co remote_branch_name (as opposed to using --set-upstream-to flag). I know this question and the accepted answers are rather old, but the behaviour has changed so that now configuration options exists to make your workflow simpler. To add to your global Git configuration, run this on the command line:As stated in the previous answers, is enough for pushing a local branch.Your colleagues, can pull all remote branches (including new ones) with this command:Then, to make changes on the branch, the usual flow:Create a new branch locally based on the current branch:Commit any changes as you normally would.  Then, push it upstream:This is a shortcut to push the current branch to a branch of the same name on origin and track it so that you don\'t need to specify origin HEAD in the future.If you wanna actually just create remote branch without having the local one, you can do it like this:It pushes whatever is your HEAD to branch foo that did not exist on the remote.First you create the branch locally:And then to create the branch remotely: Note: This works on the latests versions of git:Cheers!If you want to create a branch from the current branchyou want a branch from a remote branch, you can tryIf you are done with changes you can add the file.Then do a commit locallyWhen you want to push to remote repoAll together will beor\nIf you want to create a branch from a remote branch say development git checkout -b bug_fixes origin/developmentYou can push to the branch to remote repo byAnytime you want to update your branch from any other branch say master.git pull origin master.Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :Push the branch on github :When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch.You can see all branches created by using :Which will show :Add a new remote for your branch :Push changes from your commit into your branch :Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :Then you need to apply to merge changes, if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :Delete a branch on your local filesystem :To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :Delete the branch on github :Here All InformationOther Existing projectNow with git, you can just type, when you are in the correct branchgit push --set-upstream origin <remote-branch-name>and git create for you the origin branch.I know this question is well answered, but just wanted to list the steps I take to create a new branch "myNewBranch" and push to remote ("origin" in my case) and set up tracking. Consider this the "TL;DR" version :)Easiest Solution... Drumm Roll  . git version 2.10.1 (Apple Git-78)N.B. - The brunch you are currently on local , and the remote non-existing branch where you are trying to push , must have the same name.Just wanted to add that while:Creates a new branch, it also checks out that branch / makes it your current branch. If, for some reason, all you want to do is snap off a branch but not make it your current branch, then you would use the following command:In the first command, "checkout" makes said branch your current branch, and the "-b" means: this branch doesn\'t exist yet, so make it for me.Creating a local branch from an existing branch (can be master/ develop/ any-other-branch).git checkout -b branch_namePush this to remotegit push -u remote_name local_branch_name:remote_branch_nameHere,If we remove the local and remote branch names, it will have the format git push -u remote_name branch_nameThis will push the local branch to remote and with the same name as the local branch branch_name. The local branch will be tracking the remote branch as well.How to do through Source TreeHere is how you do it in eclipse through Egit.1) Go the "Git Repository Exploring" view and expland the git project to which you want to create a branch. Under Brances -> Local .. select the branch for which you want to create the branch ( In my case I selected master .. you can select another other branch if you wish) .. then right click and click on Create Branch option .. and select the checkout this project option and then click the finish button. 2) Now from the project explorer select the project .. right click then Team -> Push Branch.A new remote branch will be created. You can give the name of the branch to your colleagues so that they can pull it. git push -u <remote-name> <branch-name> doesn\'t work if the newly created branch isn\'t spawned from the same repo, i.e. if you haven\'t created the new branch using git checkout -b new_branch, then this will not work.For eg, I had cloned two different repositories locally and I had to copy repo2/branch1 to  repo1/ and then push it too.This link helped me push my local branch (cloned from another repo) to my remote repo:
