Here is my object literal:How can I add {key3: value3} to the object?There are two ways to add new properties to an object:The first form is used when you know the name of the property. The second form is used when the name of the property is dynamically determined. Like in this example:A real JavaScript array can be constructed using either:You could use either of these (provided key3 is the acutal key you want to use)orIf key3 is a variable, then you should do:After this, requesting arr.a_key would return the value of value3, a literal 3.I have grown fond of the LoDash / Underscore when writing larger projects.Adding by obj[\'key\'] or obj.key are all solid pure JavaScript answers. However both of LoDash and Underscore libraries do provide many additional convenient functions when working with Objects and Arrays in general..push() is for Arrays, not for objects.Depending what you are looking for, there are two specific functions that may be nice to utilize and give functionality similar to the the feel of arr.push(). For more info check the docs, they have some great examples there.The second object will overwrite or add to the base object.\nundefined values are not copied.The second object will overwrite or add to the base object.\nundefined will be copied.The second object contains defaults that will be added to base object if they don\'t exist.\nundefined values will be copied if key already exists.In addition, it may be worthwhile mentioning jQuery.extend, it functions similar to _.merge and may be a better option if you already are using jQuery.The second object will overwrite or add to the base object.\nundefined values are not copied.It may be worth mentioning the ES6/ ES2015 Object.assign, it functions similar to _.merge and may be the best option if you already are using an ES6/ES2015 polyfill like Babel if you want to polyfill yourself.The second object will overwrite or add to the base object.\nundefined will be copied.because your arr is not really an array... It\'s a prototype object. The real array would be:but it\'s still not right. It should actually be:Find Complete Example Add Key Value Pair using javascriptI know there is already an accepted answer for this but I thought I\'d document my idea somewhere.  Please [people] feel free to poke holes in this idea, as I\'m not sure if it is the best solution... but I just put this together a few minutes ago:You would utilize it in this way:Since, the prototype function is returning this you can continue to chain .push\'s to the end of your obj variable: obj.push(...).push(...).push(...);Another feature is that you can pass an array or another object as the value in the push function arguments.  See my fiddle for a working example: http://jsfiddle.net/7tEme/Your example shows an Object, not an Array.  In that case, the preferred way to add a field to an Object is to just assign to it, like so:In case you have multiple anonymous Object literals inside an Object and want to add another Object containing key/value pairs, do this:Firebug\' the Object:returns:[Object { name="Spiderman", value="11"}, Object { name="Marsipulami",\n  value="18"}, Object { name="Garfield", value="2"}]Code:will add Object {name="Peanuts", value="12"} to the Comicbook ObjectYou can create a class with the answer of  @Ionu\xc8\x9b G. StanCreating a new object with the last class:Printing the object Printing a KeyI\'m newbie in javascript, comments are welcome. Works for me.Either obj[\'key3\'] = value3 or obj.key3 = value3 will add the new pair to the obj.However, I know jQuery was not mentioned, but if you\'re using it, you can add the object through $.extend(obj,{key3: \'value3\'}). E.g.:jQuery.extend(target[,object1][,objectN]) merges the contents of two or more objects together into the first object.And it also allows recursive adds/modifications with $.extend(true,object1,object2);:Two most used ways already mentioned in most answersOne more way to define a property is using Object.defineProperty()This method is useful when you want to have more control while defining property.\nProperty defined can be set as enumerable, configurable and writable by user.You can either add it this way:or this way:The answers suggesting keying into the object with the variable key3 would only work if the value of key3 was \'key3\'.According to Property Accessors defined in ECMA-262(http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf, P67), there are two ways you can do to add properties to a exists object. All these two way, the Javascript engine will treat them the same.The first way is to use dot notation:But this way, you should use a IdentifierName after dot notation.The second way is to use bracket notation:and another form:This way, you could use a Expression (include IdentifierName) in the bracket notation.We can do this in this way too.In order to prepend a key-value pair to an object so the for in works with that element first do this:Simple use :It work fine.
