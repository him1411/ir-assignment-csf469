All I want is to get the website URL. Not the URL as taken from a link. On the page loading I need to be able to grab the full, current URL of the website and set it as a variable to do with as I please.Use:As noted in the comments, the line below works but is bugged for Firefox.See URL of type DOMString, readonly.JavaScript provides you many methods to retrieve and change the current URL which is displayed in browser\'s address bar. All these methods uses the Location object, which is  a property of the Window object. You can create a new Location object that has the current URL as follows:Basic Structure of a URLProtocol -- Specifies the protocol name be used to access the resource on the Internet. (HTTP (without SSL) or HTTPS (with SSL))hostname -- Host name specifies the host that owns the resource. For example, www.stackoverflow.com. A server provides services using the name of the host.port -- A port number used to recognize a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.pathname -- The path gives info about the specific resource within the host that the Web client wants to access. For example, /index.html.query --  A query string follows the path component, and provides a string of information that the resource can utilize for some purpose (for example, as parameters for a search or as data to be processed). hash -- The anchor portion of a URL, includes the hash sign (#).With these Location object properties you can access all of these URL componentsI Hope you got your answer..The same question has been asked less than 24 hours ago. To quote myself:Use window.location for read and\n  write access to the location\n  object\n  associated with the current frame. If\n  you just want to get the address as a\n  read-only string, you may use\n  document.URL, which should contain\n  the same value as\n  window.location.href.Gets the current page URL:To get the path, you can use:Use: window.location.href.As noted above, document.URL doesn\'t update when updating window.location. See MDN.Open Developer Tools, type in the following in the console and press Enter.Ex: Below is the screenshot of the result on the current page.Grab what you need from here. :)You can get the current URL location with a hash tag by using:JavaScript:jQuery:The above code can also help someone For complete URL with query strings:For host URL:The way to get the current location object is window.location.Compare this to document.location, which originally only returned the current URL as a string. Probably to avoid confusion, document.location was replaced with document.URL.And, all modern browsers map document.location to window.location.In reality, for cross-browser safety, you should use window.location rather than document.location.In jstl we can access the current URL path using pageContext.request.contextPath. If you want to do an Ajax call, use the following URL.Example: For the page http://stackoverflow.com/posts/36577223 this will give http://stackoverflow.com/controller/path.You can get the full link of the current page through location.href\nand to get the link of the current controller, use:There is also this:It basically does the same thing explained all above.OK, getting a full URL of the browser is easy using JavaScript. For example, try this code on this page:The window.location.href property returns the URL of the current page.
