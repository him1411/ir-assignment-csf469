After an AJAX request, sometimes my application may return an empty object, like:How can I check whether that\'s the case?ECMA 5+:Pre-ECMA 5:jQuery:lodash:Underscore:HoekExtJSAngularJS (version 1)RamdaThere\'s no easy way to do this. You\'ll have to loop over the properties explicitly:If ECMAScript 5 support is available, you can use Object.keys() instead:For those of you who have the same problem but uses jQuery, you can use jQuery.isEmptyObject.You can use Underscore.js.This is my preferred solution:see http://bencollier.net/2011/04/javascript-is-an-object-empty/ How about using JSON.stringify? It is almost available in all modern browsers.Old question, but just had the issue. Including JQuery is not really a good idea if your only purpose is to check if the object is not empty. Instead, just deep into JQuery\'s code, and you will get the answer:I just ran into a similar situation. I didn\'t want to use JQuery, and wanted to do this using pure Javascript.And what I did was, used the following condition, and it worked for me.For not equal to, use this : JSON.stringify(obj) !== \'{}\'Check out this JSFiddleThere is a simple way if you are on a newer browser.\nObject.keys(obj).length == 0I\'ve created a complete function to determine if object is empty.It uses Object.keys from ECMAScript 5 (ES5) functionality if possible to achieve the best performance (see compatibility table) and fallbacks to the most compatible approach for older engines (browsers).Here\'s the Gist for this code.And here\'s the JSFiddle with demonstration and a simple test.I hope it will help someone. Cheers!Just a workaround. Can your server generate some special property in case of no data?For example:Then you can easily check it in your AJAX callback code.Another way to check it:EDIT:\nIf you use any JSON library (f.e. JSON.js) then you may try JSON.encode() function and test the result against empty value string.I am using this.Eg:from hereUpdateORyou can use the jQuery implementation of isEmptyObjectUsing Object.keys(obj).length (as suggested above for ECMA 5+) is 10 times slower for empty objects!  keep with the old school (for...in) option.Tested under Node, Chrom, Firefox and IE 9, it becomes evident that for most use cases:Bottom line performance wise, use:orSee detailed testing results and test code at Is object empty?jQuery have special function isEmptyObject() for this case:Read more on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isEmptyObject/\nyou can use this simple code that did not use jQuery or other librariesJSON class and it\'s functions (parse and stringify) are very usefull but has some problems with IE7 that you can fix it with this simple code http://www.json.org/js.html.\n\nOther Simple Way (simplest Way) :\nyou can use this way without using jQuery or JSON object.If jQuery and the web browser is not available, there is also an isEmpty function in underscore.js.Additionally, it does not assume the input parameter to be an object. For a list or string or undefined, it will also turn the correct answer.My take:Just, I don\'t think all browsers implement Object.keys() currently.A simple loop:Best way that I found:Works for:In addition to Thevs answer:it\'s jquery + jquery.jsonCaveat! Beware of JSON\'s limitiations.displaysSugar.JS provides extended objects for this purpose. The code is clean and simple:Make an extended object:Check it\'s size:The following example show how to test if a JavaScript object is empty, if by empty we means has no own properties to it.The script works on ES6.You could check for the count of the Object keys:this one line code helps Object.getOwnPropertyNames is implemented in ECMA-5. the above line works in older browsers with a fallback function.JSFiddlerAnother alternative is to use is.js (14kB) as opposed to jquery (32kB), lodash (50kB), or underscore (16.4kB). is.js proved to be the fastest library among aforementioned libraries that could be used to determine whether an object is empty.http://jsperf.com/check-empty-object-using-librariesObviously all these libraries are not exactly the same so if you need to easily manipulate the DOM then jquery might still be a good choice or if you need more than just type checking then lodash or underscore might be good. As for is.js, here is the syntax:Like underscore\'s and lodash\'s _.isObject(), this is not exclusively for objects but also applies to arrays and strings.Under the hood this library is using Object.getOwnPropertyNames which is similar to Object.keys but Object.getOwnPropertyNames is a more thorough since it will return enumerable and non-enumerable properties as described here.If you don\'t want to bring in a library (which is understandable) and you know that you are only checking objects (not arrays or strings) then the following function should suit your needs.This is only a bit faster than is.js though just because you aren\'t checking whether it is an object.I can\'t believe after two years of programming js it never clicked that empty objects and array\'s aren\'t falsey, the weirdest thing is it never caught me out.this will return true if the input is falsey by default or if it\'s an empty object or array. the inverse is the trueish functionhttp://codepen.io/synthet1c/pen/pjmoWLThis will check the emptiness of String, Array or Object (Maps).Usage :
