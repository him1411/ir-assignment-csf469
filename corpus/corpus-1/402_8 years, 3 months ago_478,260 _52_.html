I have cloned a project that includes some .csproj files. I don\'t need/like my local csproj files being tracked by Git (or being brought up when creating a patch), but clearly they are needed in the project.I have added *.csproj to my LOCAL .gitignore, but the files are already in the repo.When I type git status, it shows my changes to csproj which I am not interested in keeping track of or submitting for patches.How do I remove the "tracking of" these files from my personal repo (but keep them in the source so I can use them) so that I don\'t see the changes when I do a status (or create a patch)?Is there a correct/canonical way to handle this situation?Just calling git rm --cached on each of the files you want to remove from revision control should be fine. As long as your local ignore patterns are correct you won\'t see these files included in the output of git status.Note that this solution removes the files from the repository, so all developers would need to maintain their own local (non-revision controlled) copies of the fileTo prevent git from detecting changes in these files you should also use this command:What you probably want to do: (from below @Ryan Taylor answer)git update-index --skip-worktree <path-name>The full answer is here in this URL: http://source.kohlerville.com/2009/02/untrack-files-in-git/If you do git update-index --assume-unchanged file.csproj, git won\'t check file.csproj for changes automatically: that will stop them coming up in git status whenever you change them. So you can mark all your .csproj files this way- although you\'ll have to manually mark any new ones that the upstream repo sends you. (If you have them in your .gitignore or .git/info/exclude, then ones you create will be ignored)I\'m not entirely sure what .csproj files are... if they\'re something along the lines of IDE configurations (similar to Eclipse\'s .eclipse and .classpath files) then I\'d suggest they should simply never be source-controlled at all. On the other hand, if they\'re part of the build system (like Makefiles) then clearly they should--- and a way to pick up optional local changes (e.g. from a local.csproj a la config.mk) would be useful: divide the build up into global parts and local overrides.This is a two step process:Remove tracking of file/folder - but keep them on disk - using Now they do not show up as "changed" but still show as   Add them to .gitignoreThe accepted answer still did not work for meI used git rm -r --cached .git add .git commit -m "fixing .gitignore"Found the answer from here There are 3 options, you probably want #31. This will keep the local file for you, but will delete it for anyone else when they pull.git rm --cached <file-name> or git rm -r --cached <folder-name>2. This is for optimization, like a folder with a large number of files, e.g. SDKs that probably won\'t ever change.  It tells git to stop checking that huge folder every time for changes, since it won\'t have any.3. This is to tell git you want your own independent version of the file or folder.  For instance, you don\'t want to overwrite (or delete) production/staging config files.It\'s important to know that git update-index will not propagate with git, and each user will have to run it independently.If you have the entire project locally but forgot to add you git ignore and are now tracking some unnecessary files use this command to remove everythingmake sure you are at the root of the project.Then you can do the usual Hope this helps out people who have to make changes to their .gitignore or forgot it all together. To save some time the rules you add to your .gitignore can be used for removing multiple files/folders i.e.git rm --cached app/**/*.xmlorgit rm --cached -r app/widgets/yourfolder/e.t.c.As pointed out in other answers, the selected answer is wrong.The answer to another question suggests that it may be skip-worktree that would be required.I am assuming that you are asking how to remove ALL the files in a specific folder or the bin folder, Rather than selecting each files separately. You can use this command:\ngit rm -r -f /<floder-name>\\*\nMake sure that you are in the parent directory of the of that directory. \nThis command will, recursively "delete" all the files which are in the bin/ or build/ folders. By the word delete I mean that git will pretend that those files are "deleted" and those files will not be tracked. The git really marks those files to be in delete mode.Do make sure that you have your .gitignore ready for upcoming commits.\nDocumentation : git rmThe problem may be caused by the order of operation.\nIf you modified the .gitignore first, then git rm --cached xxx,you may have to continue to encounter this problem.Correct solution\xef\xbc\x9aOrder invariant!The .gitignore reload after modification!I am assuming that you are trying to remove a single file from git tacking.\nfor that I would recommend below command.git update-index --assume-unchangedEx - git update-index --assume-unchanged .gitignore .idea/compiler.xmlTo prevent monitoring a file by gitAnd to revert it back use
