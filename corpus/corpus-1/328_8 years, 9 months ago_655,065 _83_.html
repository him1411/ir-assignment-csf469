Does anyone know a way to display code in Microsoft Word documents that preserves coloring and formatting? Preferably, the method would also be unobtrusive and easy to update.I have tried to include code as regular text which looks awful and gets in the way when editing regular text.  I have also tried inserting objects, a WordPad document and Text Box, into the document then putting the code inside those objects.  The code looks much better and is easier to avoid while editing the rest of the text.  However, these objects can only span one page which makes editing a nightmare when several pages of code need to be added.Lastly, I know that there are much better editors/formats that have no problem handling this but I am stuck working with MS word.Here is the best way, for me, to add code inside word:The result looks very nice. Here are the advantages of this method:And it takes only few seconds.Download and install Notepad++ and do the following:Paste your code in the window;Select the programming language from the language menu;Select the text to copy;Right click and select Plugin commands -> Copy Text with Syntax Highlighting;Paste it into MS Word and you are good to go!Update 29/06/2013:Notepad++ has a plugin called "NppExport" (comes pre-installed) that allows you to copy to RTF, HTML and ALL. It permits dozens of languages, whereas the aforementioned IDEs are limited to a handful each (without other plug-ins).I use Copy all formats to clipboard and "paste as HTML" in MS word. I type my code in Visual Studio, and then copy-paste into word. it preserves the colors. After reading a lot of related answers, I came across my own solution, which for me is the most suitable one.Result looks like this:\nAs you can see, it is the same syntax highlighting like on Stack Overflow which is quite awesome.Steps to reproduce:on Stack Overflowin WordSample code thanks to this guyWhen I\'ve done this, I\'ve made extensive use of styles. It helps a lot.What I do is create a paragraph style (perhaps called "Code Example" or something like that) which uses a monospaced font, carefully chosen tabs, a very light grey background, a thin black border above and below (that helps visibility a lot) and with spelling turned off. I also make sure that inter-line and inter-paragraph spacing are set right. I then create additional character styles on top (e.g., "Comment", "String", "Keyword", "Function Name Decl", "Variable Name Decl") which I layer on top; those set the color and whether the text is bold/italic. It\'s then pretty simple to go through and mark up a pasted example as being code and have it come out looking really good, and this is works well for short snippets. Long chunks of code probably should not normally be in something that\'s going to go on a dead tree. :-)An advantage of doing it this way is that it is easy to adapt to whatever code you\'re doing; you don\'t have to rely on some IDE to figure out whatever is going on for you. (The main problem? Printed pages typically aren\'t as wide as editor windows so wrapping will suck...)Code Format Addin is now available in Office Addins with Office 365 !\nJust select the code and click convert it and it converts the code text to formatted color code with line numbers !!! Bit Rejoice!Try defining a style called \'code\' and make it use a small fixed width font, it should look better then.Use CTRL+SPACEBAR to reset style.Maybe this is overly simple, but have you tried pasting in your code and setting the font on it to Courier New?This is a bit indirect, but it works very nicely.  Get LiveWriter and install this plugin:http://lvildosola.blogspot.com/2007/02/code-snippet-plugin-for-windows-live.htmlInsert your code using the plugin into a blog post.  Select all and copy it to Word.It looks great and can include line numbers.  It also spans pages decently.HTHColby AfricaIf you are using Sublime Text, you can copy the code from Sublime to MS Word preserving the syntax highlighting.  Install the package called SublimeHighlight.In Sublime, using your cursor, select the code you want to copy, right click it, select \'copy as rtf\', and paste into MS Word.In case you\'re like me and are too lazy or in a hurry and don\'t want to download additional software, you could use http://markup.su/highlighter/. It\'s very straight forward and supports several highlight themes and many programming languages. In my case I was using Visual Studio Code, which doesn\'t allow copying with format due to CSS involved in styling (as reported here).Copy the text from the Preview box and then in Word go to Insert -> Textbox, paste the Preview from the website, highlight all the text, and then disable spell checking for that textbox.This is what the code looks like finally.In my experience copy-paste from eclipse and Notepad++ works directly with word.For some reason I had a problem with a file that didn\'t preserve coloring. I made a new .java file, copy-paste code to that, then copy-paste to word and it worked...As the other guys said, create a new paragraph style. What I do is use mono-spaced font like courier new, small size close to 8px for fonts, single spaced with no space between paragraphs, make tab stops small (0.5cm,1cm,..,5cm), put a simple line border around the text and disable grammar checks. That way i achieved the line braking of eclipse so I don\'t have to do anything more.Hope I helped ;)Use a monospaced font like Lucida Console, which comes with Windows.  If you cut/paste from Visual Studio or something that supports syntax highlighting, you can often preserve the colour scheme of the syntax highlighter.There really isn\'t a clean way to do it, and it could still look fishy based on your exact style settings.What you could try to do is to first run a code-to-HTML conversion (there are many programs that do that), and then try to open up the HTML file with word, that might hopefully provide you with the formatted and pretty code, and then copy and paste it into your document.You can also use SciTE to paste code if you don\'t want to install heavy IDEs and then download plugins for all the code you\'re making. Simply choose your language from the language menu, type your code, high-light code, select Edit->Copy as RTF, paste into Word with formatting (default paste).SciTE supports the following languages but probably has support for others: Abaqus*, Ada, ANS.1 MIB definition files*, APDL, Assembler (NASM, MASM), Asymptote*, AutoIt*, Avenue*, Batch files (MS-DOS), Baan*, Bash*, BlitzBasic*, Bullant*, C/C++/C#, Clarion, cmake*, conf (Apache), CSound, CSS*, D, diff files*, E-Script*, Eiffel*, Erlang*, Flagship (Clipper / XBase), Flash (ActionScript), Fortran*, Forth*, GAP*, Gettext, Haskell, HTML*, HTML with embedded JavaScript, VBScript, PHP and ASP*, Gui4Cli*, IDL - both MSIDL and XPIDL*, INI, properties* and similar, InnoSetup*, Java*, JavaScript*, LISP*, LOT*, Lout*, Lua*, Make, Matlab*, Metapost*, MMIXAL, MSSQL, nnCron, NSIS*, Objective Caml*, Opal, Octave*, Pascal/Delphi*, Perl, most of it except for some ambiguous cases*, PL/M*, Progress*, PostScript*, POV-Ray*, PowerBasic*, PowerShell*, PureBasic*, Python*, R*, Rebol*, Ruby*, Scheme*, scriptol*, Specman E*, Spice, Smalltalk, SQL and PLSQL, TADS3*, TeX and LaTeX, Tcl/Tk*, VB and VBScript*, Verilog*, VHDL*, XML*, YAML*.Copying into Eclipse and paste it in Word is also another option.Vim has a nifty feature that converts code to HTML format preserving syntax highlighting, font style, background color and even line numbers. Run :TOhtml and vim creates a new buffer containing html markup.Next, open this html file in a web browser and copy/paste whatever it rendered to Word. Vim tips wiki has more information.The best presentation for code in documents is in a fixed-width font (as it should appear in an IDE), with either a faint, shaded background or a light border to distinguish the block from other text.If its Java source code copy it to Visual Studio and then copy it back to Word.I\'m using Word 2010 and I like copying and paste from a github gist. Just remember to keep source formatting!I then change the font to DejaVu Sans Mono.You can opt to copy with or without the numbering.Ok, this is weird, but to address the background color issue I paste in the text as normal, select the whole block, click on the highlighter tool to highlight (even if the highlight is set to "No Color"), and then I can style the text block without the background color of the text remaining white.  I am using VS 11 and Word 2010, but the problem has been around for a long time (see http://www.visualstudiodev.com/visual-studio-setup-installation/copypaste-code-from-vs-1305.shtml)If you are using Android Studio, you can simply copy and paste, and the code aspect is going to be preserved and the colors as well. Simple enough!I was also looking for it and ended up creating something for my code display.\nHere\'s a good way:Online tool: http://www.planetb.ca/syntax-highlight-wordJust copy the generated code and paste it in your word editing software. So far I\'ve tried it on MS Word and WPS Writer, works really well.Just paste your code in MS Words, select it -> then right click -> Numbering. In this case MS Word will interpret your code as marker/numbered list.Here is the screens: Screen1.Screen2.If you\'re using TextMate (On OS X), use the "copy as rtf" command. It will place pretty-printed text onto the clipboard.  From there you can paste into word or anything else.From Powershell ISE copy and paste to Word.\nSame with Visual Studio. If you already have the document created with plenty of code snippets in it and you are racing against time (as I unfortunately was). Save the file as a .doc as opposed to .docx and voila! Worked for me. Phew!NOTE: Obviously your document can\'t have fancy features from > word 2007.NOTE 2: File size becomes bigger if this is a concern to you.This is the simplest approach I follow. Consider I want to paste java code.I paste the code here so that spaces, tabs and flower brackets are neatly formated http://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_java_formatter.htmThen I paste the code got from step 1 here so that the colors, fonts are added to the code http://markup.su/highlighter/Then paste the preview code got from step 2 to the MS word. Finally it will look like this
