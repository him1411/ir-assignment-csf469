How can I convert a JavaScript string value to be in all lower case letters?Example: "Your Name" to "your name"Use either toLowerCase or toLocaleLowerCase methods of the String object. The difference is that toLocaleLowerCase will take current locale of the user/host into account. As per \xc2\xa7 15.5.4.17 of the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262), toLocaleLowerCase\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6works exactly the same as toLowerCase\n  except that its result is intended to\n  yield the correct result for the host\n  environment\xe2\x80\x99s current locale, rather\n  than a locale-independent result.\n  There will only be a difference in the\n  few cases (such as Turkish) where the\n  rules for that language conflict with\n  the regular Unicode case mappings.Example:Also note that the toLowerCase and toLocaleLowerCase functions are implemented to work generically on any value type. Therefore you can invoke these functions even on non-String objects. Doing so will imply automatic conversion to a string value prior to changing the case of each character in the resulting string value. For example, you can apply toLowerCase directly on a date like this:and which is effectively equivalent to:The second form is generally preferred for its simplicity and readability. On earlier versions of IE, the first had the benefit that it could work with a null value. The result of applying toLowerCase or toLocaleLowerCase on null would yield null (and not an error condition).Yes, any string in JavaScript has a toLowerCase() method that will return a new string that is the old string in all lower case.  The old string will remain unchanged.So, you can do something like:toLocaleUpperCase() or lower case functions don\'t behave like they should do.For example in my system, Safari 4, Chrome 4 Beta, Firefox 3.5.x it converts strings with Turkish characters incorrectly.The browsers respond to navigator.language as "en-US", "tr", "en-US" respectively.But there is no way to get user\'s Accept-Lang setting in the browser as far as I could find.Only Chrome gives me trouble although I have configured every browser as tr-TR locale preferred.I think these settings only affect HTTP header, but we can\'t access to these settings via JS.In the Mozilla documentation it says "The characters within a string are converted to ... while respecting the current locale.For most languages, this will return the same as ...".I think it\'s valid for Turkish, it doesn\'t differ it\'s configured as en or tr.In Turkish it should convert "D\xc4\xb0N\xc3\x87" to "din\xc3\xa7" and "DIN\xc3\x87" to "d\xc4\xb1n\xc3\xa7" or vice-versa.exampletry it onI payed attention that lots of people are looking for strtolower() in JavaScript. They are expecting the same function name as in other languages, that\'s why this post is here.I would recommend using native Javascript function "SomE StriNg".toLowerCase()Here\'s the function that behaves exactly the same as PHP\'s one (for those who are porting PHP code into js)Note that the function will ONLY work on STRING objects.For instance, I was consuming a plugin, and was confused why I was getting a \n"extension.tolowercase is not a function" JS error.Which produced the error "extension.toLowerCase is not a function"\nSo I tried this piece of code, which revealed the problem!The output was"(typeof extension)=>object<=" - so AhHa, I was NOT getting a string var for my input.  The fix is straight forward though - just force the darn thing into a String!:After the cast, the extension.toLowerCase() function worked fine.Method or Function:     toLowerCase(),     toUpperCase()Description: These methods are used to cover a string or alphabet from lower case to upper case or vice versa. e.g: "and" to "AND".Converting to Upper Case:-\nExample Code:-Result: TESTING CASE CONVERSION METHODConverting to Lower Case:- \nExample Code:Result: testing lowercase convert functionExplanation: In the above examples,Opt 1 : using toLowerCase();Opt 2 : Using your own functionCall it as:TryDemo - JSFiddle
