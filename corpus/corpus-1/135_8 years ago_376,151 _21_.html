I started some work on a new feature and after coding for a bit, I decided this feature should be on its own branch. How do I move the existing uncommitted changes to a new branch and reset my current one?I want to reset my current branch while preserving existing work on the new feature.Use the following:This will leave your current branch as is, create and checkout a new branch and keep all your changes. You can then make a commit with:and commit to your new branch with: The changes in the working directory and changes staged in index do not belong to any branch yet. This changes where those changes would end in.You don\'t reset your original branch, it stays as it is. The last commit on <old-branch> will still be the same. Therefore you checkout -b and then commit.Alternatively:Save current changes to a temp stash:$ git stashCreate a new branch based on this stash, and switch to the new branch:$ git stash branch <new-branch> stash@{0}Tip: use tab key to reduce typing the stash name.If you have been making commits on your main branch while you coded, but you now want to move those commits to a different branch:Copy your current history onto a new branch, bringing along any uncommitted changes too:Now force the original "messy" branch to roll back: (without switching to it)For example:or if you had made 4 commits:If you commit it, you could also cherry-pick the single commit ID.  I do this often when I start work in master, and then want to create a local branch before I push up to my origin/.There is alot you can do with cherry-pick, as described here, but this could be a use-case for you.
