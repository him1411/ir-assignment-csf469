I am using Git and I have committed few files using Later, I found that a file had mistakenly been added to the commit.How can I remove a file from the last commit?I think other answers here are wrong, because this is a question of moving the mistakenly committed files back to the staging area from the previous commit, without cancelling the changes done to them. This can be done like Paritosh Singh suggested:orThen reset the unwanted files in order to leave them out from the commit:Now commit again, you can even re-use the same commit message:ATTENTION! If you only want to remove a file from your previous commit, and keep it on disk, read juzzlin\'s answer just above.If this is your last commit and you want to completely delete the file from your local and the remote repository, you can: The amend flag tells git to commit again, but "merge" (not in the sense of merging two branches) this commit with the last commit.And to say it like yo, the rm in the git command is doing what rm itself does!Existing answers are all talking about removing the unwanted files from the last commit.If you want to remove unwanted files from an old commit (even pushed) and don\'t want to create a new commit, which is unnecessary, because of the action:1.Find the commit that you want the file to conform to.you can do this multiple times if you want to remove many files.2.3.Find the commit_id of the commit on which the files were added mistakenly, let\'s say "35c23c2" hereThis command opens the editor according to your settings. The default one is vim.Move the  last commit, which should be "remove unwanted files", to the next line of the incorrect commit("35c23c2" in our case), and set the command as fixup:You should be good after saving the file.To finish : If you unfortunately get conflicts, you have to solve them manually.Removing the file using rm will delete it!You\'re always adding to a commit in git rather than removing, so in this instance return the file to the state it was in prior to the first commit (this may be a delete \'rm\' action if the file is new) and then re-commit and the file will go.To return the file to some previous state:or to return it to the state at the remote HEAD:then amend the commit and you should find the file has disappeared from the list (and not deleted from your disk!)If you have not pushed the changes on the server you can useIt will reset all the changes and revert to one  commit backIf you have pushed your changes then follow steps as answered by @CharlesBThe following will unstage just the file you intended, which is what the OP asked.You\'ll see something like the following...Changes to be committed:   (use "git reset HEAD ..." to unstage)modified:   /path/to/fileChanges not staged for commit:   (use "git add ..." to update\n  what will be committed)   (use "git checkout -- ..." to discard\n  changes in working directory)modified:   /path/to/fileAt this point, you can do whatever you like to the file, such as resetting to a different version.  When you\'re ready to commit:or (if you\'ve got some other changes going on that you don\'t want to commit, yet)As the accepted answer indicates, you can do this by resetting the entire commit. But this is a rather heavy handed approach.\nA cleaner way to do this would be to keep the commit, and simply remove the changed files from it.The git reset will take the file as it was in the previous commit, and stage it in the index. The file in the working directory is untouched.\nThe git commit will then commit and squash the index into the current commit.This essentially takes the version of the file that was in the previous commit and adds it to the current commit. This results in no net change, and so the file is effectively removed from the commit.If you want to preserve your commit (maybe you already spent some time writing a detailed commit message and don\'t want to lose it), and you only want to remove the file from the commit, but not from the repository entirely:Using git GUI can simplify removing a file from the prior commit.Assuming that this isn\'t a shared branch and you don\'t mind rewriting history, then run:You can un-check the file that was mistakenly committed and then click "Commit".The file is removed from the commit, but will be kept on disk.  So if you un-checked the file after mistakenly adding it, it will show in your untracked files list (and if you un-checked the file after mistakenly modifying it it will show in your changes not staged for commit list).will leave you the local file still. If you don\'t want the file locally either, you can skip the --cached option.If all work is on your local branch, you need to keep the file in a later commit, and like having a clean history, I think a simpler way to do this could be:and you can then finish the rebase with ease without having to remember more complex commands or commit message or type as much.Do a sequence of the following commands:    Just wanted to complement the top answer as I had to run an extra command:Cheers!Something that worked for me, but still think there should be a better solution:Just leave the change you want to discard in the other commit, check others outActually, I think a quicker and easier way is to use git rebase interactive mode.(or head~4, how ever far you want to go)and then, instead of \'pick\', use \'edit\'.\nI did not realize how powerful \'edit\' is.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQosJaLN18Hope you will find it helpful.  Had the same issue where I have changes in a local branch where I wanted to revert just one file. What worked for me was -(feature/target_branch below is where I have all my changes including those I wanted to undo for a specific file)(origin/feature/target_branch is the remote branch where I want to push my changes to)(feature/staging is my temporary staging branch where I will be pushing from all my wanted changes excluding the change to that one file)Create a local branch from my origin/feature/target_branch - called it feature/stagingMerged my working local branch feature/target_branch  to the feature/staging branchChecked out feature/staging then git reset --soft ORIG_HEAD (Now all changes from the feature/staging\' will be staged but uncommitted.)Unstaged the file which I have previously checked in with unnecessary changesChanged the upstream branch for feature/staging to  origin/feature/target_branchCommitted the rest of the staged changes and pushed upstream to my remote origin/feature/target_branchIf you haven\'t yet pushed the commit, GitHub Desktop solves this problem easily:I will explain to you with example\nLet A, B, C be 3 successive commits. Commit B contains a file that should not have been committed.
