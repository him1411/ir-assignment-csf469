This question already has an answer here:How can I rotate the Android emulator display to see it in landscape mode?Windows: left Ctrl + F12.Mac: Fn + Ctrl + F12Turn off NUMLOCK and press NUMPAD 9 to rotate the emulator.As far as I know, F11 or F12 doesn\'t work, and nor does Right Ctrl + F12.Hit Left Ctrl + F12, or Home, or PageUp, (not NUMPAD 7 or NUMPAD 9 like the website says) to rotate the emulator.On Mac OS X, you can use Ctrl + Fn + F12 to rotate the Android emulator if you have have not configured your keyboard to "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" (Check it on System Preferences - Keyboard).If you have checked the option mentioned above, you will not need the Fn key and you should be able to rotate the emulator only with Ctrl + F12.If you\'re on a Mac, fn+F11 will rotate the emulator.But if you\'re using 4.4, that won\'t rotate the application orientation.

So there\'s a way to edit the device\'s configuration file instead to force it to start-up in Landscape mode.It involves manually switching the width and height in the hardware-qemui.ini file.To do so, open this file for edit in a text editor:Switch the values of the width and height, so that the width is longer than the height:The AVD now boots in Landscape mode. The orientation may still be changed with shortcut keys.Ctrl + F12 did not work for me, nor did Home, PageUp etc.So here\'s what finally came up with:For Mac you can use fn + Left control + F12.Press Left Ctrl + F11 or Left Ctrl + F12  to rotate the emulator view.Note: Right Ctrl doesn\'t work;Left Ctrl + F11 works on Windows.Use Ctrl + F11. This will rotate your emulator.For rotating the emulator, press CTRL + F12.For Linux the F12 combination does not work. Instead, use:Left Ctrl + F11First check your NumLock key is enabled.
