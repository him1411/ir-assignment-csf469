I am looking for a Javascript array insert method, in the style of:Preferably in jQuery, but any Javascript implementation will do at this point.What you want is the splice function on the native array object.arr.splice(index, 0, item); will insert item into arr at the specified index (deleting 0 items first, that is, it\'s just an insert).In this example we will create an array and add an element to it into index 2:The output of the code above will be:You can implement the Array.insert method by doing this:Then you can use it like:It can insert multiple elements (as native splice does) and supports chaining:It can merge arrays from the arguments with the given array and also supports chaining:DEMO: http://jsfiddle.net/UPphH/Other than splice, you can use this approach which will not mutate the original array, but will create a new array with the added item. You should usually avoid mutation whenever possible. I\'m using ES6 spread operator here.This can be used to add more than one item by tweaking the function a bit to use the rest operator for the new items, and spread that in the returned result as wellIf you want to insert multiple elements into an array at once check out this Stack Overflow answer: A better way to splice an array into an array in javascriptAlso here are some functions to illustrate both examples:Finally here is a jsFiddle so you can see it for youself: http://jsfiddle.net/luisperezphd/Wc8aS/And this is how you use the functions:For proper functional programming and chaining purposes an invention of Array.prototype.insert() is essential. Actually splice could have been perfect if it had returned the mutated array instead of a totally meaningless empty array. So here it goesWell ok the above with the Array.prototype.splice() one mutates the original array and some might complain like "you shouldn\'t modify what doesn\'t belong to you" and that might turn out to be right as well. So for the public welfare i would like to give another Array.prototype.insert() which doesn\'t mutate the original array. Here it goes;This:Will insert item into arr at the specified index (deleting 0 items first, that is, it\'s just an insert).Even though this has been answered already, I\'m adding this note for an alternative approach..I wanted to place a known number of items into an array, into specific postitions, as they come off of an "associative array" (i.e. an object) which by definition is not guaranteed to be in a sorted order. I wanted the resulting array to be an array of objects, but the objects to be in a specific order in the array since an array guarantees their order. So I did this..First the source object, a JSONB string retrieved from PostgreSQL. I wanted to have it sorted by the "order" property in each child object.Since the number of nodes in the object is known, I first create an array with the specified length:And then iterate the object, placing the newly created temporary objects into the desired locations in the array without really any "sorting" taking place.Another possible solution, with usage of Array#reduce.I tried this and it is working fine!!!!Index is the position where you want to insert or delete the element.\n0 i.e the second parameters defines the number of element from the index to be removed\nitem are the new entries which you want to make in array. It can be one or more than one.
