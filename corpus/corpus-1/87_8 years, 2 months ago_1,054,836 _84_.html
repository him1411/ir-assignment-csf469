I have an EditText and a Button in my layout.After writing in the edit field and clicking on the Button, I want to hide the virtual keyboard. I assume that there\'s a simple, one or two-liner code to make this happen. Where can I find an example of it?You can force Android to hide the virtual keyboard using the InputMethodManager, calling hideSoftInputFromWindow, passing in the token of the window containing your focused view.This will force the keyboard to be hidden in all situations. In some cases you will want to pass in InputMethodManager.HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLY as the second parameter to ensure you only hide the keyboard when the user didn\'t explicitly force it to appear (by holding down menu).To help clarify this madness, I\'d like to begin by apologizing on behalf of all Android users for Google\'s downright ridiculous treatment of the soft keyboard. The reason there are so many answers, each different, for the same simple question is because this API, like many others in Android, is horribly designed. I can think of no polite way to state it.I want to hide the keyboard.  I expect to provide Android with the following statement: Keyboard.hide(). The end. Thank you very much.  But Android has a problem.  You must use the InputMethodManager to hide the keyboard. OK, fine, this is Android\'s API to the keyboard. BUT! You are required to have a Context in order to get access to the IMM. Now we have a problem.  I may want to hide the keyboard from a static or utility class that has no use or need for any Context. or And FAR worse, the IMM requires that you specify what View (or even worse, what Window) you want to hide the keyboard FROM.This is what makes hiding the keyboard so challenging. Dear Google: When I\'m looking up the recipe for a cake, there is no RecipeProvider on Earth that would refuse to provide me with the recipe unless I first answer WHO the cake will be eaten by AND where it will be eaten!! This sad story ends with the ugly truth: to hide the Android keyboard, you will be required to provide 2 forms of identification: a Context and either a View or a Window.I have created a static utility method which can do the job VERY solidly, provided you call it from an Activity.Be aware that this utility method ONLY works when called from an Activity! The above method calls getCurrentFocus of the target Activity to fetch the proper window token. But suppose you want to hide the keyboard from an EditText hosted in a DialogFragment? You can\'t use the method above for that:This won\'t work because you\'ll be passing a reference to the Fragment\'s host Activity, which will have no focused control while the Fragment is shown! Wow! So, for hiding the keyboard from fragments, I resort to the lower-level, more common, and uglier:Below is some additional information gleaned from more time wasted chasing this solution:About windowSoftInputModeThere\'s yet another point of contention to be aware of. By default, Android will automatically assign initial focus to the first EditText or focusable control in your Activity.  It naturally follows that the InputMethod (typically the soft keyboard) will respond to the focus event by showing itself. The windowSoftInputMode attribute in AndroidManifest.xml, when set to stateAlwaysHidden, instructs the keyboard to ignore this automatically-assigned initial focus. Almost unbelievably, it appears to do nothing to prevent the keyboard from opening when you touch the control (unless focusable="false" and/or focusableInTouchMode="false" are assigned to the control). Apparently, the windowSoftInputMode setting applies only to automatic focus events, not to focus events triggered from touch events.Therefore, stateAlwaysHidden is VERY poorly named indeed. It should perhaps be called ignoreInitialFocus instead. Hope this helps.UPDATE: More ways to get a window tokenIf there is no focused view (e.g. can happen if you just changed fragments), there are other views that will supply a useful window token.These are alternatives for the above code if (view == null)   view = new View(activity);  These don\'t refer explicitly to your activity.Inside a fragment class:Given a fragment fragment as a parameter:Starting from your content body:UPDATE 2: Clear focus to avoid showing keyboard again if you open the app from the backgroundAdd this line to the end of the method:view.clearFocus();Also useful for hiding the soft-keyboard is:This can be used to suppress the soft-keyboard until the user actually touches the editText View.I got one more solution to hide keyboard:Here pass HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLY at the position of showFlag and 0 at the position of hiddenFlag. It will forcefully close soft Keyboard.Meier\'s solution works for me too. In my case the top level of my App is a tabHost and I want to hide the keyword when switching tabs - I get the window token from the tabHost View.Please try this below code in oncreate()Update:\nI don\'t know why this solution is not work any more ( I just tested on Android 23). Please use the solution of Saurabh Pareek instead. Here it is:Old answer:If all the other answers here don\'t work for you as you would like them to, there\'s another way of manually controlling the keyboard.Create a function with that will manage some of the EditText\'s properties:Then, make sure that onFocus of the EditText you open/close the keyboard:Now, whenever you want to open the keyboard manually call: And for closing call:Saurabh Pareek has the best answer so far.Might as well use the correct flags, though.Example of real usefrom so searching, here I found an answer that works for meIn your OnClick listener call the onEditorAction of the EditText with IME_ACTION_DONEI feel this method is better, simpler and more aligned with Android\'s design pattern.\nIn the simple example above (and usually in most of the common cases) you\'ll have an EditText that has/had focus and it also usually was the one to invoke the keyboard in the first place (it is definitely able to invoke it in many common scenarios). In that same way, it should be the one to release the keyboard, usually that can be done by an ImeAction. Just see how an EditText with android:imeOptions="actionDone" behaves, you want to achieve the same behavior by the same means.Check this related answerThis should work:I\'m using a custom keyboard to input an Hex number so I can\'t have the IMM keyboard show up...In v3.2.4_r1 setSoftInputShownOnFocus(boolean show) was added to control weather or not to display the keyboard when a TextView gets focus, but its still hidden so reflection must be used:For older versions, I got very good results (but far from perfect) with a OnGlobalLayoutListener, added with the aid of a ViewTreeObserver from my root view and then checking if the keyboard is shown like this:This last solution may show the keyboard for a split second and messes with the selection handles.When in the keyboard enters full screen, onGlobalLayout isn\'t called. To avoid that, use TextView#setImeOptions(int) or in the TextView XML declaration:Update: Just found what dialogs use to never show the keyboard and works in all versions:Alternatively to this all around solution, if you wanted to close the soft keyboard from anywhere without having a reference to the (EditText) field that was used to open the keyboard, but still wanted to do it if the field was focused, you could use this (from an Activity):I have spent more than two days working through all of the solutions posted in the thread and have found them lacking in one way or another. My exact requirement is to have a button that will with 100% reliability show or hide the on screen keyboard. When the keyboard is in its hidden state is should not re-appear, no matter what input fields the user clicks on. When it is in its visible state the keyboard should not disappear no matter what buttons the user clicks. This needs to work on Android 2.2+ all the way up to the latest devices.You can see a working implementation of this in my app clean RPN.After testing many of the suggested answers on a number of different phones (including froyo and gingerbread devices) it became apparent that android apps can reliably:For me, temporarily hiding the keyboard is not enough. On some devices it will re-appear as soon as a new text field is focused. As my app uses multiple text fields on one page, focusing a new text field will cause the hidden keyboard to pop back up again.Unfortunately item 2 and 3 on the list only work reliability when an activity is being started. Once the activity has become visible you cannot permanently hide or show the keyboard. The trick is to actually restart your activity when the user presses the keyboard toggle button.  In my app when the user presses on the toggle keyboard button, the following code runs:This causes the current activity to have its state saved into a Bundle, and then the activity is started, passing through an boolean which indicates if the keyboard should be shown or hidden.Inside the onCreate method the following code is run:If the soft keyboard should be shown, then the InputMethodManager is told to show the keyboard and the window is instructed to make the soft input always visible. If the soft keyboard should be hidden then the WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM is set.This approach works reliably on all devices I have tested on - from a 4 year old HTC phone running android 2.2 up to a nexus 7 running 4.2.2. The only disadvantage with this approach is you need to be careful with handling the back button. As my app essentially only has one screen (its a calculator) I can override onBackPressed() and return to the devices home screen.Above answers work for different scenario\'s but  If you want to hide the keyboard inside a view and struggling to get the right context try this:and to get the context fetch it from constructor:) Thanks to this SO answer, I derived the following which, in my case, works nicely when scrolling through the the fragments of a ViewPager...If you want to close the soft keyboard during a unit or functional test, you can do so by clicking the "back button" from your test:I put "back button" in quotes, since the above doesn\'t trigger the onBackPressed() for the Activity in question. It just closes the keyboard.Make sure to pause for a little while before moving on, since it takes a little while to close the back button, so subsequent clicks to Views, etc., won\'t be registered until after a short pause (1 second is long enough ime).Here\'s how you do it in Mono for Android (AKA MonoDroid)This worked for me for all the bizarre keyboard behaviorAdd to your activity    android:windowSoftInputMode="stateHidden" in Manifest file. Example:For my case, I was using the a SearchView in the actionbar. After a user performs a search, the keyboard would pop open again.Using the InputMethodManager did not close the keyboard. I had to clearFocus and set the focusable of the search view to false:use thisI have almost tried all of these answers, I had some random issues especially with the samsung galaxy s5.What I end up with is forcing the show and hide, and it works perfectly:Just use this optimized code in your activity:I have the case, where my EditText can be located also in an AlertDialog, so the keyboard should be closed on dismiss. The following code seems to be working anywhere:Simple and Easy to use method, just call hideKeyboardFrom(YourActivity.this); to hide keyboardYou could also look into using setImeOption on the EditText.I just had a very simular situation where my layout contained an EditText and a search button.  When I discovered I could just set the ime option to "actionSearch" on my editText, I realized I didn\'t even need a search button anymore.  The soft keyboard (in this mode) has a search icon, which can be used to kick off the search (and the keyboard closes itself as you would expect).
