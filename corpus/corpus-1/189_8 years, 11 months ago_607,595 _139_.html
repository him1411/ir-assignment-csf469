Should be trivial, and it might even be in the help, but I can\'t figure out how to navigate it. How do I indent multiple lines quickly in vi?Use the > command. To indent 5 lines, 5>>. To mark a block of lines and indent it, Vjj> to indent 3 lines (vim only). To indent a curly-braces block, put your cursor on one of the curly braces and use >%.If you\xe2\x80\x99re copying blocks of text around and need to align the indent of a block in its new location, use ]p instead of just p. This aligns the pasted block with the surrounding text.Also, the shiftwidth setting allows you to control how many spaces to indent.This answer summarises the other answers and comments of this question, and adds extra information based on the Vim documentation and the Vim wiki. For conciseness, this answer doesn\'t distinguish between Vi and Vim-specific commands.In the commands below, "re-indent" means "indent lines according to your indentation settings." shiftwidth is the primary variable that controls indentation.General CommandsYou can replace { with } or B, e.g. =iB is a valid block indent command. Take a look at "Indent a Code Block" for a nice example to try these commands out on.Also, remember that, so indentation commands can be easily and conveniently repeated.Re-indenting complete filesAnother common situation is requiring indentation to be fixed throughout a source file:You can extend this idea to multiple files:Or multiple buffers:In Visual ModeIn insert modeThese commands apply to the current line:Ex commandsThese are useful when you want to indent a specific range of lines, without moving your\ncursor.Indenting using markersAnother approach is via markers:...move cursor to end locationVariables that govern indentationYou can set these in your .vimrc file.Vim has intelligent indentation based on filetype. Try adding this to your .vimrc:ReferencesA big selection would be it is really fast, and everything gets indented ;-)Also try this for C-indenting indentation, do :help = for more info:={That will auto-indent the current code block you\'re in.Or just:==to auto-indent the current line.Key-Presses for more visual people: Enter Command Mode:\n\nEscape Move around to the start of the area to indent:\n\nhjkl↑↓←→ Start a block:\n\nvMove around to the end of the area to indent:\n\nhjkl↑↓←→ (Optional) Type the number of indentation levels you want \n\n0..9Execute the indentation on the block:\n\n>In addition to the answer already given and accepted, it is also possible to place a marker and then indent everything from the current cursor to the marker.  Thus, enter ma where you want the top of your indented block, cursor down as far as you need and then type >\'a (note that "a" can be substituted for any valid marker name).  This is sometimes easier than 5>> or vjjj>.The master of all commands is\n\ngg=GThis indents the entire file!And below are some of the simple and elegant commands used to indent lines quickly in Vim or gVim.To indent the current line\n\n==To indent the all the lines below the current line=GTo indent n lines below the current linen==For example, to indent 4 lines below the current line4==To indent a block of code, go to one of the braces and use command=%These are the simplest, yet powerful commands to indent multiple lines.As well as the offered solutions, I like to do things a paragraph at a time with >}Go to the start of the textwhen you select a block and use > to indent, it indents then goes back to normal mode. I have this in my .vimrc :It lets you indent your selection as many time as you want.The beauty of vim\'s UI is that it\'s consistent. Editing commands are made up of the command and a cursor move. \nThe cursor moves are always the same:  So, in order to use vim you have to learn to move the cursor and remember a repertoire of commands like, for example, > to indent (and < to "outdent").\nThus, for indenting the lines from the cursor position to the top of the screen you do >H, >G to indent to the bottom of the file.  If, instead of typing >H, you type dH then you are deleting the same block of lines, cH for replacing it, etc.Some cursor movements fit better with specific commands. In particular, the % command is handy to indent a whole HTML or XML block.\nIf the file has syntax highlighted (:syn on) then setting the cursor in the text of a tag (like, in the "i" of <div> and entering >% will indent up to the closing </div> tag.  This is how vim works: one has to remember only the cursor movements and the commands, and how to mix them.\nSo my answer to this question would be "go to one end of the block of lines you want to indent, and then type the > command and a movement to the other end of the block" if indent is interpreted as shifting the lines, = if indent is interpreted as in pretty-printing. Suppose you use 2 spaces to indent your code. Type:Then:You get the idea.(Empty lines will not get indented, which I think is kind of nice.)I found the answer in the (g)vim documentation for indenting blocks:If you want to give a count to the command, do this just before typing\n  the operator character: "v{move-around}3>" (move lines 3 indents to\n  the right).do thisand add this line this is only for cpp file you can do this for another file type also just by modifying the filetype...A quick way to do this using VISUAL MODE uses the same process as commenting a block of code. This is useful if you would prefer not to change your shiftwidth or use any set directives and is flexible enough to work with TABS or SPACES or any other character.Replacing with 3 leading spaces::\'<,\'>s/^/   /gOr replacing with leading tabs::\'<,\'>s/^/\\t/gBrief Explanation:\'<,\'> - Within the Visually Selected Ranges/^/   /g - Insert 3 spaces at the beginning of every line within the whole range(or)s/^/\\t/g - Insert Tab at the beginning of every line within the whole rangeI like to mark text for indentation:PS: you can use :\'a,\'z technique to mark a range for any operation (d,y,s///, etc) where you might use lines, numbers, or %>} or >{ indent from current line up to next paragraph<} or <{ same un-indentThere is one more way that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been mentioned yet - you can use norm i command to insert given text at the beginning of the line. To insert 10 spaces before lines 2-10:Remember that there has to be space character at the end of the command - this will be the character we want to have inserted. We can also indent line with any other text, for example to indent every line in file with 5 underscore characters:Or something even more fancy:More practical example is commenting Bash/Python/etc code with # character:To re-indent use x instead of i. For example to remove first 5 characters from every line:For me, the MacVim (Visual) solution was, select with mouse and press ">", but after putting the following lines in "~/.vimrc" since I like spaces instead of tabs:Also it\'s useful to be able to call MacVim from the command-line (Terminal.app), so since I have the following helper directory "~/bin", where I place a script called "macvim":And of course in "~/.bashrc":Macports messes with "~/.profile" a lot, so the PATH environment variable can get quite long.I dont know why its so difficult to find a simple answer like this one...I myself had to struggle a lot to know this its\nits very simpleedit your .vimrc file under home directory\nadd this linein you file where you want to indent properly in normal/command mode type5== will indent 5 lines from current cursor position.\nso you can type any number before == , it will indent number of lines.\nThis is in command mode.gg=G will indent whole file from top to bottom.Using Python a lot, I find myself needing frequently needing to shift blocks by more than one indent. You can do this by using any of the block selection methods, and then just enter the number of indents you wish to jump right before the >Eg. V5j3> will indent 5 lines 3 times - which is 12 spaces if you use 4 spaces for indents:help leftIn ex mode you can use :left or :le to align lines a specified amount. \nSpecifically, :left will Left align lines in the [range]. It sets the indent in the lines to [indent] (default 0).:%le3 or :%le 3  or :%left3 or :%left 3 will align the entire file by padding with three spaces.:5,7 le 3 will align lines 5 through 7 by padding them with 3 spaces.:le without any value or :le 0 will left align with a padding of 0.This works in vim and gvim. To indent every line in a file type,\nesc then G=ggI didn\'t find a method I use in the comments, so I\'ll share it (I think vim only):This is useful when you don\'t want to change ident/tab settings in vimrc or to remember them to change it while editing.To unindent I use the same ctrl-v block select to select spaces and delete it with d.Option 1: Indent a block of code in vi to three spaces with Visual Block mode:Select the block of code you want to indent.  Do this using Ctrl+V in normal mode and arrowing down to select text.  While it is selected, enter : to give a command to the block of selected text.The following will appear in the command line: :\'<,\'>To set indent to 3 spaces, type le 3 and press enter.  This is what appears: :\'<,\'>le 3The selected text is immediately indented to 3 spaces.  Option 2: Indent a block of code in vi to three spaces with Visual Line mode:Be in normal mode press the following keys:Interpretation of what you did:V means start selecting text.jjjj arrows down 4 lines, highlighting 4 lines.: tells vi you will enter an instruction for the highlighted text.le 3 means indent highlighted text 3 lines.
