I\'m a little confused about two XML properties: match_parent and fill_parent. It seems that both are the same. Is there any difference between them?They\'re the same thing (in API Level 8+). Use match_parent.FILL_PARENT (renamed MATCH_PARENT in API Level 8 and higher), which means that the view wants to be as big as its parent (minus padding)...fill_parent: The view should be as big as its parent (minus padding). This constant is deprecated starting from API Level 8 and is replaced by match_parent.http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewGroup.LayoutParams.htmlGoogle changed the name to avoid confusion.Problem with the old name fill parent was that it implies its affecting the dimensions of the parent, while match parent better describes the resulting behavior - match the dimension with the parent.Both constants resolve to -1 in the end, and so result in the identical behavior in the app.  Ironically enough, this name change made to clarify things seems to have added confusion rather than eliminating it.Functionally no difference, Google just changed the name from fill_parent to match_parent, from API level 8 (Android 2.2). FILL_PARENT is still available for compatibility reason.LayoutParams.FILL_PARENT and LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT both have value -1. Not sure what tempted google to change from Fill Parent to Match Parent :)Since most of the phones are >= Android 2.2 .. you should use Match Parent for future compatibility... not sure when they will discontinue the older Fill Parent constant!For compatibility sake it\'s better to stick to fill_parent, i.e, when supporting below API 8 devices.\nBut if your app targets API 8 and upwards, you should use match_parent instead.fill_parent (renamed MATCH_PARENT in API Level 8 and higher), which means that the view wants to be as big as its parent (minus padding)fill_parent: The view should be as big as its parent (minus padding). This constant is deprecated starting from API Level 8 and is replaced by match_parentFor Android API 1.6 to 2.1 match_parent will throw you an error, so use fill_parent in these cases. To support backward compatibility, it\'s better to use fill_parentSo MATCH_PARENT and FILL_PARENT are the same?Yes, MATCH_PARENT and FILL_PARENT are just different constant names for the same integer value (-1 if you are curious) used to specify a View\'s layout mode within its parent.So why was MATCH_PARENT added?I remember that Roman Guy (Android Developer at Google) said, that they have changed the name because "fill_parent" was confusing for developers. As matter of the fact, "fill_parent" does not fill the remaining space (for that you use the weight attribute) but it takes as much space as its layout parent. That\'s why the new name is "match_parent"MATCH_PARENT and FILL_PARENT are the same?Yes, MATCH_PARENT and FILL_PARENT are just different constant names for the same integer value (-1 if you are curious) used to specify a View\'s layout mode within its parent.So why was MATCH_PARENT added?The Android team found that developers were misinterpreting FILL_PARENT to mean that a View would fill the remaining space left in its parent. In fact, by specifying FILL_PARENT, the View is requesting to be as big as its parent. Thus, (as explained by Romain Guy himself in this video at around 10:56) the constant was renamed MATCH_PARENT to clarify its use.Okay, I get how FILL_PARENT/MATCH_PARENT works. What does it matter if I use one or the other?FILL_PARENT is deprecated. Being deprecated does not make it the Devil, but eventually it will go away. Your application is more future-proof using MATCH_PARENT. Why use the deprecated option when the current option behaves exactly the same?Furthermore, FILL_PARENT is actually misleading. I have personally seen folks confused because it does not work the way they thought it would. In fact, I have seen a single tag using both FILL_PARENT and MATCH_PARENT, because the developer thought (understandably) that they were two different layout modes.HOW YOU CAN GET TRIPPED UP TRYING TO FILL_PARENT?Here\'s a quick example of how MATCH_PARENT/FILL_PARENT confusion can lead to folks repeatedly applying their heads to their desks. First, take a really simple layout containing a few View instances.FILL_PARENT is deprecated in API level 8 and MATCH_PARENTuse higherlevel APImatch_parent  is used in place of fill_parent and sets it to go as far as the parent goes. Just use match_parent and forget about fill_parent. I completely ditched fill_parent and everything is perfect as usual. Check here for more. Just to give it a name closer to it\'s actual action. "fill_parent" does not fill the remaining space as the name would imply (for that you use the weight attribute). Instead, it takes up as much space as its layout parent. That\'s why the new name is "match_parent"When you set layout width and height  as match_parent in XML property, it will occupy the complete area that the parent view has, i.e. it will be as big as the parent.Hare parent is red and child is green. Child occupy all area. Because it\'s width and height  are match_parent.Note : If parent is applied a padding then that space would not be included. So TextView hight = 300dp(parent hight) - (20(paddingTop)+10(paddingBottom))\n= (300 - 30) dp\n= 270 dpfill_parent is previous name of match_parentFor API Level 8 and higher fill_parent renamed as match_parent and fill_parent is deprecated now.So fill_parent and match_parent are same. The view should be as big as its parent (minus padding). This constant is deprecated starting from API Level 8 and is replaced by {@code match_parent}.Both have similar functionality only difference is that fill_parent is used up to API level 8 and match_parent is used after API level 8 or higher level.fill_parent (renamed MATCH_PARENT in API Level 8 and higher), which means that the view wants to be as big as its parent (minus padding)fill_parent: The view should be as big as its parent (minus padding).

To see it\'s effect, I added a border of each textView content.In "Match parent" textView content, we can see it\'s layout width spread out of it\'s parent whole length.But we can see in "Wrap Content" textView content, it\'s layout width wrapped in of it\'s content(Wrap Content) length.
