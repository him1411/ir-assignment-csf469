I\'m using the MySQL command line utility and can navigate through a database. Now I need to see a list of user accounts.

Login to mysql as root and type following query MySQL stores the user information in its own database. The name of the database is mysql. Inside that database the user information is in a table, a dataset, named user. If you want to see what users are set up in the MySQL user table, run the following command:The mysql.db table is possibly more important in determining user rights. I think an entry in it is created if you mention a table in the GRANT command. In my case the mysql.users table showed no permissions for a user when it obviously was able to connect and select, etc.Peter and Jesse are correct but just make sure you first select the mysql DB.use mysql;select User from mysql.user;that should do your trickI use this to sort the users, so the permitted hosts are more easy to spot:here display List of unique users.This command on execution will prompt for password of root user in mysql and then it will print all the users to the text file.I found his one more useful. \nit tells you DML vs DDL privileges
