I am confused about the assets folder. It doesn\'t come auto-created in Android Studio, and almost all the forums in which this is discussed talk about Eclipse.How can the Assets directory be configured in Android Studio?Since Android Studio uses the new Gradle-based build system, you should be putting assets/ inside of the source sets (e.g., src/main/assets/).In a typical Android Studio project, you will have an app/ module, with a main/ sourceset (app/src/main/ off of the project root), and so your primary assets would go in app/src/main/assets/. However:If you need assets specific to a build, such as debug versus release, you can create sourcesets for those roles (e.g,. app/src/release/assets/)Your product flavors can also have sourcesets with assets (e.g., app/src/googleplay/assets/)Your instrumentation tests can have an androidTest sourceset with custom assets (e.g., app/src/androidTest/assets/), though be sure to ask the InstrumentationRegistry for getContext(), not getTargetContext(), to access those assetsAlso, a quick reminder: assets are read-only at runtime. Use internal storage, external storage, or the Storage Access Framework for read/write content.Let Android Studio do it for you.And voila! It will create the assets folder in the main target source set.Looking inside the .iml file of your project you will see the following line:This means the "assets" folder is already declared for Gradle. You will need to create it under src/main/ (I\'m using Android Studio 0.4.2).Select the app folder and then:File > New > folder > assets Folder ,the default location is inside /main folderSimple follow thisFile > New > folder > assets FolderNote : App must be selected before creating folder.In android studio you can specify where the source, res, assets folders are located.\nfor each module/app in the build.gradle file you can add something like:If you tried all your bullets in this thread in vain  try cleaning your project . In my case it  only worked after Projet -> cleanright click on app folder->new->folder->Assets folder->set Target Source set->click on finish buttonneed configure parameter for gradle\ni hope is will work  Put the assets folder in the main/src/assets.It mightnt show on you side bar if app is selected. Click the drop down at the top that says android and select packages. you will see it then.When upgrading to the release version of Android Studio, you may be automatically switched to the new Android project View (see here for more info). If you swap back to either the Project or Packages view, you should see the standard folder hierarchy of a Gradle-based project. Then refer to CommonsWare\'s answer for the appropriate location.Click over main \xe2\x86\x92 new directory \xe2\x86\x92 directory name "assets"In Android Studio, click on the app folder, then the src folder, and then the main folder. Inside the main folder you can add the assets folder.
