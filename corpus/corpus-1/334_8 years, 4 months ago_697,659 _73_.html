I have a script that uses $(document).ready, but it doesn\'t use anything else from jQuery. I\'d like to lighten it up by removing the jQuery dependency.How can I implement my own $(document).ready functionality without using jQuery? I know that  using window.onload will not be the same, as window.onload fires after all images, frames, etc. have been loaded.There is a standards based replacement,DOMContentLoaded that is supported by over 98% of browsers, though not IE8:jQuery\'s native function is much more complicated than just window.onload, as depicted below.  As the accepted answer was very far from complete, I stitched together a "ready" function like jQuery.ready() based on jQuery 1.6.2 source:How to use:I am not sure how functional this code is, but it worked fine with my superficial tests. This took quite a while, so I hope you and others can benefit from it.PS.: I suggest compiling it.Or you can use http://dustindiaz.com/smallest-domready-ever:or the native function if you only need to support the new browsersThree options:onreadystatechangeSource: MDNDOMContentLoadedConcerned about stone age browsers:\nGo to the jQuery source code and use the ready function. In that case you are not parsing+executing the whole library you\'re are doing only a very small part of it.Place your <script>/*JavaScript code*/</script> right before the closing </body> tag.Admittedly, this might not suit everyone\'s purposes since it requires changing the HTML file rather than just doing something in the JavaScript file a la document.ready, but still...Poor man\'s solution:View FiddleAdded this one, a bit better I guess, own scope, and non recursiveView FiddleI use this:Note: This probably only works with newer browsers, especially these: http://caniuse.com/#feat=domcontentloadedReally, if you care about Internet Explorer 9+ only, this code would be enough to replace jQuery.ready:If you worry about Internet Explorer 6 and some really strange and rare browsers, this will work:I was recently using this for a mobile site. This is John Resig\'s simplified version from "Pro JavaScript Techniques". It depends on addEvent.The jQuery answer was pretty useful to me. With a little refactory it fitted my needs well.\nI hope it helps anybody else.This question was asked quite a long time ago.  For anyone just seeing this question, there is now a site called "you might not need jquery"  which breaks down - by level of IE support required - all the functionality of jquery and provides some alternative, smaller libraries.IE8 document ready script according to you might not need jqueryHere is the smallest code snippet to test DOM ready which works across all browsers (even IE 8):See this answer.Cross-browser (old browsers too) and a simple solution:Showing alert in jsfiddleJust add this to the bottom of your HTML page...Because, HTML documents are parsed by top-bottom.This cross-browser code will call a function once the DOM is ready:Here\'s how it works:For example, if you do this: domReady(function(){alert();});, the following will appended to the body element:Note that this works only for user-defined functions. The following won\'t work: domReady(alert);It is worth looking in Rock Solid addEvent() and http://www.braksator.com/how-to-make-your-own-jquery.Here is the code in case the site goes downHow about this solution?We found a quick-and-dirty cross browser implementation of ours that may do the trick for most simple cases with a minimal implementation:It\'s always good to use JavaScript equivalents as compared to jQuery. One reason is one fewer library to depend on and they are much faster than the jQuery equivalents.One fantastic reference for jQuery equivalents is http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/.As far as your question is concerned, I took the below code from the above link :)\nOnly caveat is it only works with Internet Explorer 9 and later.The setTimeout/setInterval solutions presented here will only work in specific circumstances.The problem shows up especially in older Internet Explorer versions up to 8.The variables affecting the success of these setTimeout/setInterval solutions are:the original (native Javascript) code solving this specific issue is here:this is the code from which the jQuery team have built their implementation.Here\'s what I use, it\'s fast and covers all bases I think; works for everything except IE<9.This seems to catch all cases:The DOMContentLoaded event is available in IE9 and everything else, so I personally think it\'s OK to use this. Rewrite the arrow function declaration to a regular anonymous function if you\'re not transpiling your code from ES2015  to ES5.If you want to wait until all assets are loaded, all images displayed etc then use window.onload instead.For IE9+:The ready function in jQuery does a number of things. Frankly, I don\'t see that point of replacing it unless you have amazingly small output from your website. jQuery is a pretty tiny library, and it handles all sorts of cross-browser things you\'ll need later.Anyway, there\'s little point in posting it here, just open up jQuery and look at the bindReady method.It starts by calling either document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded") or document.attachEvent(\'onreadystatechange\') depending on the event model, and goes on from there.If you are loading jQuery near the bottom of BODY, but are having trouble with code that writes out jQuery(<func>) or jQuery(document).ready(<func>), check out jqShim on Github.Rather than recreate its own document ready function, it simply holds onto the functions until jQuery is available then proceeds with jQuery as expected. The point of moving jQuery to the bottom of body is to speed up page load, and you can still accomplish it by inlining the jqShim.min.js in the head of your template.I ended up writing this code to make moving all the scripts in WordPress to the footer, and just this shim code now sits directly in the header.This approach is the shortest way I can think of.The solution based on the DOMContentLoaded event only works if the script is loaded before the document, whereas the lazy check suggested here ensures the code is executed always, even in scripts loaded dynamically later on, exactly as the JQuery\'s document ready.This code is compatible with all browsers (including some legacy, down to IE6 and Safari for Windows).onDocReady provides a callback when the HTML dom is ready to fully  access/parse/manipulate.onDocLoad provides a callback when everything has loaded (images etc)This was a good https://stackoverflow.com/a/11810957/185565 poor man\'s solution. One comment considered a counter to bail out in case of emergency. This is my modification.Edit of the edit of @duskwuff to support Internet Explorer 8 too. The difference is a new call to the function test of the regex and the setTimeout with an anonymous function.Also, I set the timeout to 99.In short, instead of the $(document).ready() used in jQuery, we can use a JavaScript method:Thus, when the page is ready i.e. DOMContentLoaded only then the function function_name() will be invoked.If you want to support Internet Explorer 7+ (no quirks, compatibility and other pain), last Chrome, last Safari, last Firefox and no iframes - this will be enough:
