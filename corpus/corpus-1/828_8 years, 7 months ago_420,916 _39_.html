I would like to create a String.replaceAll() method in JavaScript and I\'m thinking that using a RegEx would be most terse way to do it.  However, I can\'t figure out how to pass a variable in to a RegEx.  I can do this already which will replace all the instances of "B" with "A".But I want to do something like this:But obviously this will only replace the text "replaceThis"...so how do I pass this variable in to my RegEx string?Instead of using the /regex/g syntax, you can construct a new RegExp object:You can dynamically create regex objects this way. Then you will do:As Eric Wendelin mentioned, you can do something like this:This yields "regex matching .". However, it will fail if str1 is ".". You\'d expect the result to be "pattern matching regex", replacing the period with "regex", but it\'ll turn out to be...This is because, although "." is a String, in the RegExp constructor it\'s still interpreted as a regular expression, meaning any non-line-break character, meaning every character in the string. For this purpose, the following function may be useful:Then you can do:yielding "pattern matching regex"."ABABAB".replace(/B/g, "A");As always: don\'t use regex unless you have to. For a simple string replace, the idiom is:Then you don\'t have to worry about the quoting issues mentioned in Gracenotes\'s answer.For anyone looking to use variable with the match method, this worked for meThis:is equivalent to this:See http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp.Test with this tool You want to build the regular expression dynamically and for this the proper solutuion is to use the new RegExp(string) constructor. In order for constructor to treat special characters literally, you must escape them. There is a built-in function in jQuery UI autocomplete widget called $.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex:[...] you can make use of the built-in\n  $.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex function. It\'ll take a single string\n  argument and escape all regex characters, making the result safe to\n  pass to new RegExp().If you are using jQuery UI you can use that function, or copy its definition from the source:And use it like this:While you can make dynamically-created RegExp\'s (as per the other responses to this question), I\'ll echo my comment from a similar post: The functional form of String.replace() is extremely useful and in many cases reduces the need for dynamically-created RegExp objects. (which are kind of a pain \'cause you have to express the input to the RegExp constructor as a string rather than use the slashes /[A-Z]+/ regexp literal format)Here\'s another replaceAll implementation:To satisfy my need to insert a variable/alias/function into a Regular Expression, this is what I came up with:where \'oldre\' is the original regexp that I want to insert a variable,\n\'xx\' is the placeholder for that variable/alias/function,\nand \'yy\' is the actual variable name, alias, or function.Test it like:You can use this if $1 not work with youYou can always use indexOf repeatedly:This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go into an infinite loop when the replacement contains the match.All your solution is here,Pass a variabe to regular expression.The one which I have implemented is by taking the value from a text field which is the one you want to replace and and another is "replace with" text field,getting the value from text-field in a variable and setting the variable to RegExp function to further replace.In my case I am using Jquery,You also can do it by only javaScript too.JavaScript code:This code is on Onclick event of a button,You can put this in a function to call.So now You can pass variable in replace function.And the coffeescript version of Steven Penny\'s answer, since this is #2 google result....even if coffee is just javascript with a lot of characters removed...;)and in my particular case
