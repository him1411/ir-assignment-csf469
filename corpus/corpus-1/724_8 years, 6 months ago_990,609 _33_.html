I have a table that has several nullable integer columns.  This is undesirable for several reasons, so I am looking to update all nulls to 0 and then set these columns to NOT NULL. Aside from changing nulls to 0, data must be preserved.I am looking for the specific SQL syntax to alter a column (call it ColumnA) to "not null".  Assume the data has been updated to not contain nulls.Using SQL server 2000.First, make all current NULL values disappear:Then, update the table definition to disallow NULLs:I had the same problem, but the field used to default to null, and now I want to default it to 0.  That required adding one more line after mdb\'s solution:You will have to do it in two steps:Update the table so that there are no nulls in the column.UPDATE MyTable SET MyNullableColumn = 0\n WHERE MyNullableColumn IS NULLAlter the table to change the property of the columnALTER TABLE MyTable\n ALTER COLUMN MyNullableColumn MyNullableColumnDatatype NOT NULLFor Oracle 11g, I was able to change the column attribute as follows:Otherwise abatichev\'s answer seemed good. You can\'t repeat the alter - it complains (at least in SQL Developer) that the column is already not null.As long as the column is not a unique identifierThenAlter the table and set the field to non null and specify a default value of 0this worked for me:this seems simpler, but only works on Oracle:in addition, with this, you can also add columns, not just alter it.\nIt updates to the default value (0) in this example, if the value was null.In case of FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT... there will be a problem if \'0\' is not present in the column of Primary key table. The solution for that is...STEP1:Disable all the constraints using this code :STEP2:STEP3:Enable all the constraints using this code :Making column not null and adding default can also be done in the SSMS GUI. UPDATE myTable SET myColumn = 0In my case I had difficulties with the posted answers. I ended up using the following:Change VARCHAR(200) to your datatype, and optionally change the default value. If you don\'t have a default value you\'re going to have a problem making this change, as default would be null creating a conflict.For the inbuilt javaDB  included in the JDK (Oracle\'s supported distribution of the Apache Derby) the below worked for me
