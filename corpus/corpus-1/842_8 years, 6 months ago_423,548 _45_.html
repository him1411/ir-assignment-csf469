I have my Git repository which, at the root, has two sub directories:When this was in SVN, /finisht was checked out in one place, while /static was checked out elsewhere, like so:Is there a way to do this with Git?This is called a sparse checkout, available since version 1.7.0."Sparse checkout" allows populating the working directory sparsely. It uses the skip-worktree bit (see git-update-index) to tell Git whether a file in the working directory is worth looking at.While $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout is usually used to specify what files are in, you can also specify what files are not in, using negate patterns. For example, to remove the file unwanted:See the linked answer and manual for details.What you are trying to do is called a sparse checkout, and that feature was added in git 1.7.0 (Feb. 2012). The steps to do a sparse clone are as follows:This creates an empty repository with your remote, and fetches all objects but doesn\'t check them out. Then do:Now you need to define which files/folders you want to actually check out. This is done by listing them in .git/info/sparse-checkout, eg:Last but not least, update your empty repo with the state from the remote:You will now have files "checked out" for some/dir and another/sub/tree on your file system (with those paths still), and no other paths present.You might want to have a look at the extended tutorial and you should probably read the official documentation for sparse checkout.Note that this will still download the whole repository from the server \xe2\x80\x93 only the checkout is reduced in size. At the moment it is not possible to clone only a single directory. But if you don\'t need the history of the repository, you can at least save on bandwidth by creating a shallow clone. See udondan\'s answer below for information on how to combine shallow clone and sparse checkout.You can combine the sparse checkout and the shallow clone features. The shallow clone cuts off the history and the sparse checkout only pulls the files matching your patterns.You\'ll need minimum git 1.9 for this to work. Tested it myself only with 2.2.0 and 2.2.2.This way you\'ll be still able to push, which is not possible with git archive.Git 1.7.0 has \xe2\x80\x9csparse checkouts\xe2\x80\x9d. See \n\xe2\x80\x9ccore.sparseCheckout\xe2\x80\x9d in the git config manpage, \n\xe2\x80\x9cSparse checkout\xe2\x80\x9d in the git read-tree manpage, and\n\xe2\x80\x9cSkip-worktree bit\xe2\x80\x9d in the git update-index manpage.The interface is not as convenient as SVN\xe2\x80\x99s (e.g. there is no way to make a sparse checkout at the time of an initial clone), but the base functionality upon which simpler interfaces could be built is now available.If you never plan to interact with the repository from which you cloned, you can do a full git clone and rewrite your repository using git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter. This way, at least the history will be preserved.This looks far simpler:For other users who just want to download a file/folder from githubsimply usee.g.(yes, that\'s svn here. apparently in 2016 you still need svn to simply download some github files)Courtesy of Download a single folder or directory from a GitHub repo Important! Make sure you update the github URL and replace \'/tree/master/\' with \'/trunk/\'.It\'s not possible to clone subdirectory only with Git, but below are few workarounds.You may want to rewrite the repository to look as if trunk/public_html/ had been its project root, and discard all other history (using filter-branch), try on already checkout branch:Notes: The -- that separates filter-branch options from revision options, and the --all to rewrite all branches and tags. All information including original commit times or merge information will be preserved. This command honors .git/info/grafts file and refs in the refs/replace/ namespace, so if you have any grafts or replacement refs defined, running this command will make them permanent.Warning! The rewritten history will have different object names for all the objects and will not converge with the original branch. You will not be able to easily push and distribute the rewritten branch on top of the original branch. Please do not use this command if you do not know the full implications, and avoid using it anyway, if a simple single commit would suffice to fix your problem. Here are simple steps with sparse checkout approach which will populate the working directory sparsely, so you can tell Git which folder(s) or file(s) in the working directory are worth checking out.Clone repository as usual (--no-checkout is optional):You may skip this step, if you\'ve your repository already cloned.Hint: For large repos, consider shallow clone (--depth 1) to checkout only latest revision or/and --single-branch only.Enable sparseCheckout option:Specify folder(s) for sparse checkout (without space at the end):or edit .git/info/sparse-checkout.Checkout the branch (e.g. master):Now you should have selected folders in your current directory.You may consider symbolic links if you\'ve too many levels of directories or filtering branch instead.I just wrote a script for GitHub.Usage: Why not just the following -- after you initialize the repo, do:\ngit checkout This works for files and folders, I do this all the time when i want to clean checkout something.
