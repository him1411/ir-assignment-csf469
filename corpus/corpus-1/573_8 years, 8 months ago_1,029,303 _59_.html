What is the difference between LEFT JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN?As per the documentation: FROM (Transact-SQL):The keyword OUTER is marked as optional (enclosed in square brackets), and what this means in this case is that whether you specify it or not makes no difference. Note that while the other elements of the join clause is also marked as optional, leaving them out will of course make a difference.For instance, the entire type-part of the JOIN clause is optional, in which case the default is INNER if you just specify JOIN. In other words, this is legal:Here\'s a list of equivalent syntaxes:Also take a look at the answer I left on this other SO question: SQL left join vs multiple tables on FROM line?.To answer your question there is no difference between LEFT JOIN\n  and LEFT OUTER JOIN, they are exactly same that said...INNER JOIN - fetches data if present in both the tables.OUTER JOIN are of 3 types:CROSS JOIN, as the name suggests, does [n X m] that joins everything to everything.\nSimilar to scenario where we simply lists the tables for joining (in the FROM clause of the SELECT statement), using commas to separate them.Points to be noted:For those who want to visualise these in a better way, please go to this link:\nA Visual Explanation of SQL JoinsWhat is the difference between left join and left outer join?Nothing. LEFT JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN are equivalent.Read more at Visual Representation of SQL JoinsI\'m a PostgreSQL DBA, as far as I could understand the difference between outer or not outer joins difference is a topic that has considerable discussion all around the internet. Until today I never saw a difference between those two; So I went further and I try to find the difference between those. \nAt the end I read the whole documentation about it and I found the answer for this, So if you look on documentation (at least in PostgreSQL) you can find this phrase:"The words INNER and OUTER are optional in all forms. INNER is the default; LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL imply an outer join." In another words, LEFT JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN ARE THE SAMERIGHT JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN ARE THE SAMEI hope it can be a contribute for those who are still trying to find the answer.Nothing to say in words beside this:I find it easier to think of Joins in the following order:Until I figured out this (relatively) simple model, JOINS were always a bit more of a black art.  Now they make perfect sense.Hope this helps more than it confuses.Why are LEFT/RIGHT and LEFT OUTER/RIGHT OUTER the same? Let\'s explain why this vocabulary.\nUnderstand that LEFT and RIGHT joins are specific cases of the OUTER join, and therefore couldn\'t be anything else than OUTER LEFT/OUTER RIGHT. The OUTER join is also called FULL OUTER as opposed to LEFT and RIGHT joins that are PARTIAL results of the OUTER join. Indeed:It is now clear why those operations have aliases, as well as it is clear only 3 cases exist: INNER, OUTER, CROSS. With two sub-cases for the OUTER.\nThe vocabulary, the way teachers explain this, as well as some answers above, often make it looks like there are lots of different types of join. But it\'s actually very simple.Left Join and Left Outer Join are one in the same.  The former is the shorthand for the latter.  The same can be said about the Right Join and Right Outer Join relationship.  The demonstration will illustrate the equality.  Working examples of each query have been provided via SQL Fiddle.  This tool will allow for hands on manipulation of the query.GivenLeft Join and Left Outer JoinResultsRight Join and Right Outer JoinResultsThere are mainly three types of JOINOuter: are of three typesCross Join: joins everything to everythingSyntactic sugar, makes it more obvious to the casual reader that the join isn\'t an inner one. To answer your questionIn Sql Server joins syntax OUTER is optionalIt is mentioned in msdn article : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177634(v=sql.130).aspxSo following list shows join equivalent syntaxes with and without OUTEROther equivalent syntaxesStrongly Recommend Dotnet Mob Artice : Joins in Sql Server\nC) Outer join:Hope it\'d help.Nothing.  LEFT JOIN, by default it does OUTER.LEFT JOIN performs a join starting with the first (left-most) table and then any matching second (right-most) table records.LEFT JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN are the same.According to DoFactoryI know that this is old however wanted to put my two cents in.  I understand that the LEFT JOIN should be the same as LEFT OUTER JOIN but in my experience I have seen a LEFT JOIN pull back different Results than a LEFT OUTER JOIN so I have started to use the key word OUTER to be more specific and proper.  Rows that should have come back in a LEFT JOIN did not where as when I would use a LEFT OUTER JOIN it did.  I was trying to explain this to a colleague when he was unable to get the rows that he needed as well so I decided to Google the difference so as to have some sort of backing to show him.  This might be a SQL Server specific thing to which I am uncertain about.  I would say that in good practice it would be more advisable to explicitly state that you want an outer join to occur.  Just my opinion.
