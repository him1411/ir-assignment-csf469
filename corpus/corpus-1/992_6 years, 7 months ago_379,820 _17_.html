Due to some bad cherry-picking, my local git repository is currently 5 commits ahead of the origin, and not in a good state. I want to get rid of all these commits and start over again.Obviously, deleting my working directory and re-cloning would do it, but downloading everything from github again seems like overkill, and not a good use of my time.Maybe git revert is what I need, but I don\'t want to end up 10 commits ahead of the origin (or even 6), even if it does get the code itself back to the right state. I just want to pretend the last half-hour never happened.Is there a simple command that will do this? It seems like an obvious use case, but I\'m not finding any examples of it.If your excess commits are only visible to you, you can just do git reset --hard origin/<branch_name> to move back to where the origin is.Doing a git revert makes new commits to remove old commits in a way that keeps everyone\'s history sane.Simply delete your local master branch and recreate it like so:Try:to reset your head to wherever you want to be. Use gitk to see which commit you want to be at. You can do reset within gitk as well.If you are using Atlassian SourceTree app, you could use the reset option in the context menu.On your branch attempt:Validate the reversal (to the state, with no local commits), using "git log" or "git status" hence.To see/get the sha1 id of the commit you want to come back too   To roll back to that commit!Note. All the commits that were made after that commit will be deleted(and all your modification to the project). So first better clone the project to another branch or copy to another dir.For local commits which are not being pushed, you can also use git rebase -i to delete or squash a commit.
