Could someone explain to me the meaning of @classmethod and @staticmethod in python? I need to know the difference and the meaning. As far as I understand, @classmethod tells a class that it\'s a method which should be inherited into subclasses, or... something. However, what\'s the point of that? Why not just define the class method without adding @classmethod or @staticmethod or any @ definitions?tl;dr: when should I use them, why should I use them, and how should I use them?I\'m pretty advanced with C++, so using more advanced programming concepts shouldn\'t be a problem. Feel free giving me a corresponding C++ example if possible.Though classmethod and staticmethod are quite similar, there\'s a slight difference in usage for both entities: classmethod must have a reference to a class object as the first parameter, whereas staticmethod can have no parameters at all.Let\'s look at all that was said in real examples.BoilerplateLet\'s assume an example of a class, dealing with date information (this is what will be our boilerplate to cook on):This class obviously could be used to store information about certain dates (without timezone information; let\'s assume all dates are presented in UTC).Here we have __init__, a typical initializer of Python class instances, which receives arguments as a typical instancemethod, having the first non-optional argument (self) that holds reference to a newly created instance.Class MethodWe have some tasks that can be nicely done using classmethods.Let\'s assume that we want to create a lot of Date class instances having date information coming from outer source encoded as a string of next format (\'dd-mm-yyyy\'). We have to do that in different places of our source code in project.So what we must do here is:This will look like:For this purpose, C++ has such feature as overloading, but Python lacks that feature- so here\'s when classmethod applies. Lets create another "constructor".Let\'s look more carefully at the above implementation, and review what advantages we have here:Static methodWhat about staticmethod? It\'s pretty similar to classmethod but doesn\'t take any obligatory parameters (like a class method or instance method does).Let\'s look at the next use case.We have a date string that we want to validate somehow. This task is also logically bound to Date class we\'ve used so far, but still doesn\'t require instantiation of it.Here is where staticmethod can be useful. Let\'s look at the next piece of code:So, as we can see from usage of staticmethod, we don\'t have any access to what the class is- it\'s basically just a function,  called syntactically like a method, but without access to the object and it\'s internals (fields and another methods), while classmethod does.Rostyslav Dzinko\'s answer is very appropriate. I thought I could highlight one other reason you should choose @classmethod over @staticmethod when you are creating additional constructor.In the example above, Rostyslav used the @classmethod from_string as a Factory to create Date objects from otherwise unacceptable parameters. The same can be done with @staticmethod as is shown in the code below:Thus both new_year and millenium_new_year are instances of Date class.But, if you observe closely, the Factory process is hard-coded to create Date objects no matter what. What this means is that even if the Date class is subclassed, the subclasses will still create plain Date object (without any property of the subclass). See that in the example below:datetime2 is not an instance of DateTime? WTF? Well that\'s because of the @staticmethod decorator used.In most cases, this is undesired. If what you want is a Factory method that is aware of the class that called it, then @classmethod is what you need.Rewriting the Date.millenium as (that\'s the only part of the above code that changes)ensures that the class is not hard-coded but rather learnt. cls can be any subclass. The resulting object will rightly be an instance of cls. Let\'s test that out.The reason is, as you know by now, @classmethod was used instead of @staticmethod@classmethod means: when this method is called, we pass the class as the first argument instead of the instance of that class (as we normally do with methods). This means you can use the class and its properties inside that method rather than a particular instance.@staticmethod means:  when this method is called, we don\'t pass an instance of the class to it (as we normally do with methods). This means you can put a function inside a class but you can\'t access the instance of that class (this is useful when your method does not use the instance).@staticmethod function is nothing more than a function defined inside a class. It is callable without instantiating the class first. It\xe2\x80\x99s definition is immutable via inheritance.@classmethod function also callable without instantiating the class, but its definition follows Sub class, not Parent class, via inheritance, can be overridden by subclass. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the first argument for @classmethod function must always be cls (class).here is good link to this topic.One would use @classmethod when he/she would want to change the behaviour of the method based on which subclass is calling the method. remember we have a reference to the calling class in a class method.While using static you would want the behaviour to remain unchanged across subclasses Example:A little compilation@staticmethod\nA way to write a method inside a class without reference to the object it is being called on. So no need to pass implicit argument like self or cls.\nIt is written exactly the same how written outside the class, but it is not of no use in python because if you need to encapsulate a method inside a class since this method needs to be the part of that class @staticmethod is comes handy in that case.@classmethod\nIt is important when you want to write a factory method and by this custom attribute(s) can be attached in a class. This attribute(s) can be overridden in the inherited class.A comparison between these two methods can be as belowA slightly different way to think about it that might be useful for someone... A class method is used in a superclass to define how that method should behave when it\'s called by different child classes. A static method is used when we want to return the same thing regardless of the child class that we are calling.I\'m a beginner on this site, I have read all above answers, and got the information what I want. However, I don\'t have the right to upvote.  So I want to get my start on StackOverflow with the answer as I understand it.Class method can modify the class state,it bound to the class and it contain cls as parameter.Static method can not modify the class state,it bound to the class and it does\'t know class or instance
