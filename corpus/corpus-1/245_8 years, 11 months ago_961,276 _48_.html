I\'ve seen a few different ways to iterate over a Dictionary in C#.  Is there a standard way?If you are trying to use a generic Dictionary in C# like you would use an associative array in another language:Or, if you only need to iterate over the collection of keys, useAnd lastly, if you\'re only interested in the values:(Take note that the var keyword is an optional C# 3.0 and above feature, you could also use the exact type of your keys/values here)In some cases you may need a counter that may be provided by for-loop implementation. For that, LINQ provides ElementAt which enables the following:Depends on whether you\'re after the keys or the values...From the MSDN Dictionary<(Of <(TKey, TValue>)>) Class description:Generally, asking for "the best way" without a specific context is like asking what is the best color.One the one hand, there are many colors and there\'s no best color.  It depends on the need and often on taste, too.On the other hand, there are many ways to iterate over a Dictionary in C# and there\'s no best way. It depends on the need and often on taste, too.If you need only the value (allows to call it item, more readable than kvp.Value).Generally, beginners are surprised about order of enumeration of a Dictionary.LINQ provides a concise syntax that allows to specify order (and many other things), e.g.:Again you might only need the value. LINQ also provides a concise solution to: Here it is:There are many more real-world use case you can do from these examples.\nIf you don\'t need a specific order, just stick to the "most straightforward way" (see above)!I would say foreach is the standard way, though it obviously depends on what you\'re looking forIs that what you\'re looking for?There are plenty of options. My personal favorite is by KeyValuePairYou can also use the Keys and Values CollectionsYou can also try this on big dictionaries for multithreaded processing.I appreciate this question has already had a lot of responses but I wanted to throw in a little research.Iterating over a dictionary can be rather slow when compared with iterating over something like an array. In my tests an iteration over an array took 0.015003 seconds whereas an iteration over a dictionary (with the same number of elements) took 0.0365073 seconds that\'s 2.4 times as long! Although I have seen much bigger differences. For comparison a List was somewhere in between at 0.00215043 seconds.However, that is like comparing apples and oranges. My point is that iterating over dictionaries is slow.Dictionaries are optimised for lookups, so with that in mind I\'ve created two methods. One simply does a foreach, the other iterates the keys then looks up.This one loads the keys and iterates over them instead (I did also try pulling the keys into a string[] but the difference was negligible.With this example the normal foreach test took 0.0310062 and the keys version took 0.2205441. Loading all the keys and iterating over all the lookups is clearly a LOT slower!For a final test I\'ve performed my iteration ten times to see if there are any benefits to using the keys here (by this point I was just curious):Here\'s the RunTest method if that helps you visualise what\'s going on.Here the normal foreach run took 0.2820564 seconds (around ten times longer than a single iteration took - as you\'d expect). The iteration over the keys took 2.2249449 seconds.Edited To Add:\nReading some of the other answers made me question what would happen if I used Dictionary instead of Dictionary. In this example the array took 0.0120024 seconds, the list 0.0185037 seconds and the dictionary 0.0465093 seconds. It\'s reasonable to expect that the data type makes a difference on how much slower the dictionary is.What are my Conclusions?You suggested below to iterateFYI, foreach doesn\'t work if the value are of type object.Simplest form to iterate a dictionary:Sometimes if you only needs the values to be enumerated, use the dictionary\'s value collection:Reported by this post which states it is the fastest method:\nhttp://alexpinsker.blogspot.hk/2010/02/c-fastest-way-to-iterate-over.htmlI found this method in the documentation for the DictionaryBase class on MSDN:This was the only one I was able to get functioning correctly in a class that inherited from the DictionaryBase.I will take the advantage of .NET 4.0+ and provide an updated answer to the originally accepted one:The standard way to iterate over a Dictionary, according to official documentation on MSDN is:If say, you want to iterate over the values collection by default, I believe you can implement IEnumerable<>, Where T is the type of the values object in the dictionary, and "this" is a Dictionary. Not the standard way, but working:Just wanted to add my 2 cent, as the most answers relate to foreach-loop.\nPlease, take a look at the following code:Altought this adds a additional call of \'.ToList()\', there might be a slight performance-improvement (as pointed out here foreach vs someList.Foreach(){}), \nespacially when working with large Dictionaries and running in parallel is no option / won\'t have an effect at all.Also, please note that you wont be able to assign values to the \'Value\' property inside a foreach-loop. On the other hand, you will be able to manipulate the \'Key\' as well, possibly getting you into trouble at runtime.When you just want to "read" Keys and Values, you might also use IEnumerable.Select().
