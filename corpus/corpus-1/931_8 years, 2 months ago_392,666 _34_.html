How do I get the current stack trace in Java, like how in .NET you can do Environment.StackTrace?BTW, Thread.dumpStack() is not what I want - I want to get the stack trace back, not print it out.You can use Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace().That returns an array of StackTraceElements that represent the current stack trace of a program.is fine if you don\'t care what the first element of the stack is.will have a defined position for your current method, if that matters.is available since JDK1.5.For an older version, you can redirect exception.printStackTrace() to a StringWriter() :You can use Apache\'s commons for that:On android a far easier way is to use this:To get the stack trace of all threads you can either use the jstack utility, JConsole or send a kill -quit signal (on a Posix operating system).However, if you want to do this programmatically you could try using ThreadMXBean:As mentioned, if you only want the stack trace of the current thread it\'s a lot easier - Just use Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();Another solution (only 35 31 characters):Silly me, it\'s Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();I have a utility method that returns a string with the stacktrace:And just logit like...or To string with guava: Tony, as a comment to the accepted answer, has given what seems to be the best answer which actually answers the OP\'s question:... the OP did NOT ask how to get a String from the stack trace from an Exception.  And although I\'m a huge fan of Apache Commons, when there is something as simple as the above there is no logical reason to use an outside library.Maybe you could try this:The string \'errorDetail\' contains the stacktrace.The last element of the array represents the bottom of the stack, which is the least recent method invocation in the sequence.loop through StackTraceElement and get your desired result.In Java 9 there is a new way:You can use jstack utility if you want to check the current call stack of your process.System.out.println(Arrays.toString(Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace()));This will help you to print stack trace without loop.I suggest that is an easier way and has the advantage of not actually constructing an exception or throwable when there may not be a problem at all, and is considerably more to the point.I used answers from above and added formattingThis is an old post, but here is my solution : More info and more methods there : \nhttp://javarevisited.blogspot.fr/2013/04/how-to-get-current-stack-trace-in-java-thread.html
