I would like to create an HTML button that acts like a link. So, when you click the button, it redirects to a page. I would like it to be as accessible as possible.I would also like it so there aren\'t any extra characters, or parameters in the URL.How can I achieve this?Based on the answers posted so far, I am currently doing this:but the problem with this is that in Safari and Internet Explorer, it adds a question mark character to the end of the URL. I need to find a solution that doesn\'t add any characters to the end of the URL.There are two other solutions to do this: Using JavaScript or styling a link to look like a button.Using JavaScript:But this obviously requires JavaScript, and for that reason it is less accessible to screen readers. The point of a link is to go to another page. So trying to make a button act like a link is the wrong solution. My suggestion is that you should use a link and style it to look like a button.The plain HTML way is to put it in a <form> wherein you specify the desired target URL in the action attribute.If necessary, set CSS display: inline; on the form to keep it in the flow with the surrounding text. Instead of <input type="submit"> in above example, you can also use <button type="submit">. The only difference is that the <button> element allows children.You\'d intuitively expect to be able to use <button href="http://google.com"> analogous with the <a> element, but unfortunately no, this attribute does not exist according to HTML specification.If CSS is allowed, simply use an <a> which you style to look like a button using among others the appearance property (only Internet Explorer support is currently (July 2015) still poor).Or pick one of those many CSS libraries like Bootstrap.If JavaScript is allowed, set the window.location.href.If it\'s the visual appearance of a button you\'re looking for in a basic HTML anchor tag then you can use the Twitter Bootstrap framework to format any of the following common HTML type links/buttons to appear as a button. Please note the visual differences between version 2 and 3 of the framework:Bootstrap (v2) sample appearance:Bootstrap (v3) sample appearance:Visit the Bootstrap (v2) or Bootstrap (v3) Buttons section for some samples.Use:Unfortunately, this markup is no longer valid in HTML5 and will neither validate nor always work as potentially expected. Use another approach.As of HTML5, buttons support the formaction attribute. Best of all, no Javascript or trickery is needed.Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attr-formaction\nBrowser Support: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#Browser_compatibilityIt is actualy very simple and without using any form elements. You can just use the <a> tag with a button inside :).Like this:And it will load the href into the same page. Want a new page? Just use target="_blank".If you are using an inside form, add the attribute type="reset" along with the button element. It will prevent the form action.Are there any downsides to doing something like the following?Where a.nostyle is a class that has your link styling (where you can get rid of the standard link styling) and span.button is a class that has the styling for your "button" (background, border, gradient, etc.).You can simply put an a tag around the element:https://jsfiddle.net/hj6gob8b/The only way to do this (except for BalusC\'s ingenious form idea!) is by adding a JavaScript onclick event to the button, which is not good for accessibility. Have you considered styling a normal link like a button? You can\'t achieve OS specific buttons that way, but it\'s still the best way IMO.Going along with what a few others have added, you can go wild with just using a simple CSS class with no PHP, no jQuery code, just simple HTML and CSS.Create a CSS class and add it to your anchor. The code is below.That is it. It is very easy to do and lets you be as creative as you\'d like. You control the colors, the size, the shapes(radius), etc. For more detailsm, see the site I found this on.Another option is to create a link in the button:Then use CSS to style the link and button, so that the link takes up the entire space within the button (so there\'s no miss-clicking by the user):I have created a demo here.If you want to avoid having to use a form or an input and you\'re looking for a button-looking link, you can create good-looking button links with a div wrapper, an anchor and an h1 tag. You\'d potentially want this so you can freely place the link-button around your page. This is especially useful for horizontally centering buttons and having vertically-centered text inside of them. Here\'s how:Your button will be comprised of three nested pieces: a div wrapper, an anchor, and an h1, like so:Then in CSS, your styling should look like so:Here\'s a jsFiddle to check it out and play around with it.Benefits of this setup:\n1. Making the div wrapper display: block makes it easy to center (using margin: 0 auto) and position (while an <a> is inline and harder to positionand not possible to center).You could just make the <a> display:block, move it around, and style it as a button, but then vertically aligning text inside of it becomes hard.This allows you to make the <a> display: inline-table and the <h1> display: table-cell, which allows you to use vertical-align: middle on the <h1> and center it vertically (which is always nice on a button). Yes, you could use padding, but if you want your button to dynamically resize, that won\'t be as clean.Sometimes when you embed an <a> within a div, only the text is clickable, this setup makes the whole button clickable.You don\'t have to deal with forms if you\'re just trying to move to another page. Forms are meant for inputting information, and they should be reserved for that.Allows you to cleanly separte the button styling and text styling from each other (stretch advantage? Sure, but CSS can get nasty-looking so it\'s nice to decompose it).It definitely made my life easier styling a mobile website for variable-sized screens.There seems to be three solutions to this problem (all with pros and cons).But the problem with this is that in some version of popular browsers such as Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer, it adds a question mark character to the end of the URL. So in other words for the code above your URL will end up looking like this:There is one way to fix this, but it will require server-side configuration. One example using Apache Mod_rewrite would be to redirect all requests with a trailing ? to their corresponding URL without the ?. Here is an example using .htaccess, but there is a full thread here:Similar configurations can vary depending on the webserver and stack used. So a summary of this approach:Pros:Cons:You can use JavaScript to trigger onclick and other events to mimic the behavior of a link using a button. The example below could be improve and remove from the HTML, but it is there simply to illustrate the idea:Pros:Cons:Styling a link like a button is relatively easy and can provide similar experience across different browsers. Bootstrap does this, but it is also easy to achieve on your own using simple styles.Pros:Cons:Solution #1 (Button in a form) seems like the most transparent for users with minimal work required. If your layout is not impacted by this choice and the server side tweak is feasible, this is a good option for cases where accessibility is the top priority (e.g. links on an error page or error messages).If JavaScript is not an obstacle to your accessibility requirements, then solution #2 (JavaScript) would be preferred over #1 and #3.If for some reason, accessibility is vital (JavaScript is not an option) but you are in a situation where your design and/or your server configuration is preventing you from using option #1, then solution #3 (Anchor styled like a button) is a good alternative solve this problem with minimal usability impact.If you want to create a button that is used for a URL anywhere, create a button class for an anchor.Use it as data-href="index.html" inside the button tag.For HTML 5 and styled button along with image backgroundI know there have been a lot of answers submitted, but none of them seemed to really nail the problem. Here is my take at a solution:Regarding BalusC\'s reply,I needed to add variables to the button and wasn\'t sure how. I ended up using input type hidden. I thought this might be helpful to others who found this page like myself.I used this for a website I\'m currently working on and it works great!. If you want some cool styling too I\'ll put the CSS down here.Working JSFiddle here@Nicolas,following worked for me as yours didn\'t have type="button" due to which it started behaving as submit type..since i already have one submit type.it didn\'t worked for me ....and now you can either add class to button or to  to get required layout:People who have answered using <a></a> attributes on a <button></button> was helpful.BUT then recently, I encountered a problem when I used a link inside a <form></form>.The button is now regarded like/as a submit button (HTML5). I\'ve tried working a way around, and have found this method.Create a CSS style button like the one below:Or create a new one here : CSS Button GeneratorAnd then create your link with a class tag named after the CSS style you have made:Here\'s a fiddle:JS FiddleYou could also set the buttons type-property to "button" (it makes it not submit the form), and then nest it inside a link (makes it redirect the user).This way you could have another button in the same form that does submit the form, in case that\'s needed. I also think this is preferable in most cases over setting the form method and action to be a link (unless it\'s a search-form I guess...)Example:This way the first button redirects the user, while the second submits the form.Be careful to make sure the button doesn\'t trigger any action, as that will result in a conflict. Also as Arius pointed out, you should be aware that, for the above reason, this isn\'t strictly speaking considered valid HTML, according to the standard. It does however work as expected in Firefox and Chrome, but I haven\'t yet tested it for Internet Explorer.Also you can use a button:For example, in ASP.NET Core syntax:If what you need is that it will look like a button, with emphasis on the gradient image, you can do this:
