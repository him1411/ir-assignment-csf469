I have this JSON in a file:I wrote this script which prints all of the json text:How can I parse the file and extract single values?I think what Ignacio is saying is that your JSON file is incorrect. You have [] when you should have {}. [] are for lists, {} are for dictionaries.Here\'s how your JSON file should look, your JSON file wouldn\'t even load for me:Then you can use your code:With data, you can now also find values like so:Try those out and see if it starts to make sense.Your data.json should look like this:Your code should be:Note that this only works in Python 2.6 and up, as it depends upon the with-statement. In Python 2.5 use from __future__ import with_statement, in Python <= 2.4, see Justin Peel\'s answer, which this answer is based upon.You can now also access single values like this:@Justin Peel\'s answer is really helpful, but if you are using Python 3 reading JSON should be done like this:Note: use json.loads instead of json.load. In Python 3, json.loads takes a string parameter. json.load takes a file-like object parameter. data_file.read() returns a string object."Ultra JSON" or simply "ujson" can handle having [] in your JSON file input. If you\'re reading a JSON input file into your program as a list of JSON elements; such as, [{[{}]}, {}, [], etc...] ujson can handle any arbitrary order of lists of dictionaries, dictionaries of lists. You can find ujson in the Python package index and the API is almost identical to Python\'s built-in json library. ujson is also much more faster if you\'re loading larger JSON files. You can see the performance details in comparison to other Python JSON libraries in the same link provided.if you are in python 3 here is how you can do itThe code should look like assuming connection.json file looks like above
