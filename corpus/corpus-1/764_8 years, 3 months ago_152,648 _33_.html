Today I was looking through the logs for a project and realized that I fat fingered a tag name some time ago. Is there some way to rename the tag? Google hasn\'t turned up anything useful.I realize I could check out the tagged version and make a new tag, I even tried that. But that seems to create a tag object that isn\'t quite right. For one,lists it out of order relative to all of the other tags. I have no idea if that\'s significant, but it leads me to believe that the new tag object isn\'t quite what I want. I can live with that, because I really only care that the tag name matches the documentation, but I\'d rather do it "right", assuming there is a right way to do this.Here is how I rename a tag old to new:The colon in the push command removes the tag from the remote repository. If you don\'t do this, git will create the old tag on your machine when you pull.Finally, make sure that the other users remove the deleted tag. Please tell them(co-workers) to run the following command:The original question was how to rename a tag, which is easy: first create NEW as an alias of OLD: tag NEW OLD then delete OLD: tag -d OLD.The quote regarding "the git way" and (in)sanity is offbase because it\'s talking about preserving a tag name but making it refer to a different repo state.In addition to the other answers:First you need to build an alias of the old tag name:Then you need to delete the old one locally:Then delete the tag on you remote location(s):Finally you need to add your new tag to the remote location. Until you haven\'t done this, the new tag(s) will not be added:Iterate this for every remote location.If it\'s published, you can\'t delete it ( without risking being tarred and feathered, that is). The \'git way\' is to do:The sane thing. Just admit you screwed up, and use a different name. Others have already seen one tag-name, and if you keep the same name, you may be in the situation that two people both have "version X", but they actually have different "X"\'s. So just call it "X.1" and be done with it.Alternatively,The insane thing. You really want to call the new version "X" too, even though others have already seen the old one. So just use git-tag -f again, as if you hadn\'t already published the old one. It\'s so insane because:Git does not (and it should not) change tags behind users back. So if somebody already got the old tag, doing a git-pull on your tree shouldn\'t just make them overwrite the old one.If somebody got a release tag from you, you cannot just change the tag for them by updating your own one. This is a big security issue, in that people MUST be able to trust their tag-names. If you really want to do the insane thing, you need to just fess up to it, and tell people that you messed up. All courtesy of the man pagesThis wiki page has this interesting one-liner, which reminds us that we can push several refs:and ask other cloners to do git pull --prune --tagsSo the idea is to push:See as an example "Change naming convention of tags inside a git repository?".As an add on to the other answers, I added an alias to do it all in one step, with a more familiar *nix move command feel. Argument 1 is the old tag name, argument 2 is the new tag name.Usage:For the adventurous it can be done in one command:The easy part is renaming local tags. The tougher part is the remote ones.\nThe idea behind this trick is to duplicate the old tag/branch to a new one and delete the old one, without checkout.Remote tag rename / Remote branch \xe2\x86\x92 tag conversion: (Notice: :refs/tags/)Remote branch rename / Remote tag \xe2\x86\x92 branch conversion: (Notice: :refs/heads/)Output renaming a remote tag:
