How can I output colored text to the terminal, in Python?\nWhat is the best Unicode symbol to represent a solid block?This somewhat depends on what platform you are on. The most common way to do this is by printing ANSI escape sequences. For a simple example, here\'s some python code from the blender build scripts:To use code like this, you can do something like This will work on unixes including OS X, linux and windows (provided you use ANSICON, or in Windows 10 provided you enable VT100 emulation). There are ansi codes for setting the color, moving the cursor, and more.If you are going to get complicated with this (and it sounds like you are if you are writing a game), you should look into the "curses" module, which handles a lot of the complicated parts of this for you. The Python Curses HowTO is a good introduction.If you are not using extended ASCII (i.e. not on a PC), you are stuck with the ascii characters below 127, and \'#\' or \'@\' is probably your best bet for a block. If you can ensure your terminal is using a IBM extended ascii character set, you have many more options. Characters 176, 177, 178 and 219 are the "block characters".Some modern text-based programs, such as "Dwarf Fortress", emulate text mode in a graphical mode, and use images of the classic PC font. You can find some of these bitmaps that you can use on the Dwarf Fortress Wiki see (user-made tilesets).The Text Mode Demo Contest has more resources for doing graphics in text mode.Hmm.. I think got a little carried away on this answer. I am in the midst of planning an epic text-based adventure game, though. Good luck with your colored text!I\'m surprised no one has mentioned the Python termcolor module. Usage is pretty simple:It may not be sophisticated enough, however, for game programming and the "colored blocks" that you want to do...The answer is Colorama for all cross-platform coloring in Python.Print a string that starts a color/style, then the string, then end the color/style change with \'\\x1b[0m\':Get a table of format options for shell text with following code:You want to learn about ANSI escape sequences. Here\'s a brief example:For more info see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_codeFor a block character, try a unicode character like \\u2588:Putting it all together:My favorite way is with the Blessings library (full disclosure: I wrote it). For example:To print colored bricks, the most reliable way is to print spaces with background colors. I use this technique to draw the progress bar in nose-progressive:You can print in specific locations as well:If you have to muck with other terminal capabilities in the course of your game, you can do that as well. You can use Python\'s standard string formatting to keep it readable:The nice thing about Blessings is that it does its best to work on all sorts of terminals, not just the (overwhelmingly common) ANSI-color ones. It also keeps unreadable escape sequences out of your code while remaining concise to use. Have fun!Try this simple code generated a class with all the colors using a for loop to iterate every combination of color up to 100, then wrote a class with python colors. Copy and paste as you will, GPLv2 by me:Define a string that starts a color and a string that ends the color, then print your text with the start string at the front and the end string at the end.This produces the following in bash, in urxvt with a Zenburn-style color scheme:Through experemintation, we can get more colors:Note: \\33[5m and \\33[6m are blinking.This way we can create a full color collection:Here is the code to generate the test:On Windows you can use module \'win32console\' (available in some Python distributions) or module \'ctypes\' (Python 2.5 and up) to access the Win32 API.To see complete code that supports both ways, see the color console reporting code from Testoob.ctypes example:Stupidly simple based on @joeld\'s answerThen justI have wrapped @joeld answer into a module with global functions that I can use anywhere in my code.file: log.py     use as follows:I use the colorama module for coloured terminal printing in Python. A link is here http://pypi.python.org/pypi/coloramaSome example code of printing red and green text:I used colorama to write a basic Matrix programInstallation on Ubuntu (your distribution install command may be different)uses ANSI  Make your function :-Call function :- red("Good one")\n  Good one  <--  It will print in Red , Note :- not required any module For Windows you cannot print to console with colors unless you\'re using the win32api.For Linux it\'s as simple as using print, with the escape sequences outlined here:ColorsFor the character to print like a box, it really depends on what font you are using for the console window. The pound symbol works well, but it depends on the font:note how well the with keyword mixes with modifiers like these that need to be reset (using Python 3 and Colorama):You can use the Python implementation of the curses library:\nhttp://docs.python.org/library/curses.htmlAlso, run this and you\'ll find your box:You could use CLINT:Get it from GitHub.Building on @joeld answer, using https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lazyme pip install -U lazyme :Screenshot:Some updates to the color_print with new formatters, e.g.:Note: italic, fast blinking and strikethrough may not work on all terminals, doesn\'t work on Mac / Ubuntu. E.g. Screenshot:If you are programming a game perhaps you would like to change the background color and use only spaces? For example:Here\'s a curses example:while i find this answer useful, i modified it a bit. this Github Gist is the resultusagein addition you can wrap common usages:I ended up doing this, I felt it was cleanest: https://raw.github.com/fabric/fabric/master/fabric/colors.pyIf you are using Windows, then here you go!If you are using Django snapshot:(I generally use colored output for debugging on runserver terminal so I added it.)\nYou can test if it is installed in your machine:\n $ python -c "import django; print django.VERSION"\nTo install it check: How to install Django\nGive it a Try!!asciimatics provides a portable support for building text UI and animations:Asciicast:Yet another pypi module that wraps the python 3 print function:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorprintIt\'s usable in python 2.x if you also from __future__ import print. Here is a python 2 example from the modules pypi page:Outputs "Hello, world!" with the words in blue and the exclamation mark bold red and blinking.I wrote a simple module, available at:\nhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorconsoleIt works with Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.\nIt uses ANSI for Linux and Mac, but native calls to console functions on Windows.\nYou have colors, cursor positioning and keyboard input. It is not a replacement for curses, but can be very useful if you need to use in simple scripts or ASCII games.Your terminal most probably uses Unicode (typically UTF-8 encoded) characters, so it\'s only a matter of the appropriate font selection to see your favorite character. Unicode char U+2588, "Full block" is the one I would suggest you use.Try the following:Examine the file later with your favourite viewer.curses is the module you want to use. Check this tutorial.
