How can an email address be validated in JavaScript?Using regular expressions is probably the best way. You can see a bunch of tests here (taken from chromium)Here\'s the example of regular expresion that accepts unicode:But keep in mind that one should not rely only upon JavaScript validation. JavaScript can  easily be disabled. This should be validated on the server side as well.Here\'s an example of the above in action:Just for completeness, here you have another RFC 2822 compliant regexThe official standard is known as RFC 2822. It describes the syntax that valid email addresses must adhere to. You can (but you shouldn\'t â€” read on) implement it with this regular expression:(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&\'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\\.[a-z0-9!#$%&\'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|"(?:[\\x01-\\x08\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x1f\\x21\\x23-\\x5b\\x5d-\\x7f]|\\\\[\\x01-\\x09\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x7f])*")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\\[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\\x01-\\x08\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x1f\\x21-\\x5a\\x53-\\x7f]|\\\\[\\x01-\\x09\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x7f])+)\\])(...) We get a more practical implementation of RFC 2822 if we omit the syntax using double quotes and square brackets. It will still match 99.99% of all email addresses in actual use today.[a-z0-9!#$%&\'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\\.[a-z0-9!#$%&\'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?A further change you could make is to allow any two-letter country code top level domain, and only specific generic top level domains. This regex filters dummy email addresses like asdf@adsf.adsf. You will need to update it as new top-level domains are added.[a-z0-9!#$%&\'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\\.[a-z0-9!#$%&\'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\\.)+(?:[A-Z]{2}|com|org|net|gov|mil|biz|info|mobi|name|aero|jobs|museum)\\bSo even when following official standards, there are still trade-offs to be made. Don\'t blindly copy regular expressions from online libraries or discussion forums. Always test them on your own data and with your own applications.Emphasis mineI\'ve slightly modified Jaymon\'s answer for people who want really simple validation in the form of:anystring@anystring.anystringThe regular expression:Example JavaScript function:There\'s something you have to understand the second you decide to use a regular expression to validate emails: It\'s probably not a good idea. Once you have come to terms with that, there are many implementations out there that can get you halfway there, this article sums them up nicely.In short, however, the only way to be absolutely, positively sure that what the user entered is in fact an email is to actually send an email and see what happens. Other than that it\'s all just guesses.Wow, there are lots of complexity here. If all you want to do is just catch the most obvious syntax errors, I would do something like this:It usually catches the most obvious errors that the user makes and assures that the form is mostly right, which is what JavaScript validation is all about.HTML5 itself has email validation. If your browser supports HTML5 then you can use the following code.jsFiddle linkFrom the HTML5 spec:A valid e-mail address is a string that matches the email production of the following ABNF, the character set for which is Unicode.This requirement is a willful violation of RFC 5322, which defines a syntax for e-mail addresses that is simultaneously too strict (before the "@" character), too vague (after the "@" character), and too lax (allowing comments, whitespace characters, and quoted strings in manners unfamiliar to most users) to be of practical use here.The following JavaScript- and Perl-compatible regular expression is an implementation of the above definition.In modern browsers you can build on top of @Sushil\'s answer with pure JavaScript and the DOM:I\'ve put together an example in the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/boldewyn/2b6d5/. Combined with feature detection and the bare-bones validation from Squirtle\'s Answer, it frees you from the regular expression massacre and does not bork on old browsers.I have found this to be the best solution:It allows the following formats:It\'s clearly versatile and allows the all-important international characters, while still enforcing the basic anything@anything.anything format. It will block spaces which are technically allowed by RFC, but they are so rare that I\'m happy to do this.JavaScript can match a regular expression:Here\'s an RFC22 regular expression for emails:This is the correct RFC822 version.Correct validation of email address in compliance with the RFCs is not something that can be achieved with a one-liner regular expression. An article with the best solution I\'ve found in PHP is What is a valid email address?. Obviously, it has been ported to Java. I think the function is too complex to be ported and used in JavaScript.A good practice is to validate your data on the client, but double-check the validation on the server. With this in mind, you can simply check whether a string looks like a valid email address on the client and perform the strict check on the server.Here\'s the JavaScript function I use to check if a string looks like a valid mail address:Explanation:lastAtPos < lastDotPos: Last @ should be before last . since @ cannot be part of server name (as far as I know).lastAtPos > 0: There should be something (the email username) before the last @.str.indexOf(\'@@\') == -1: There should be no @@ in the address. Even if @ appears as the last character in email username, it has to be quoted so " would be between that @ and the last @ in the address.lastDotPos > 2: There should be at least three characters before the last dot, for example a@b.com.(str.length - lastDotPos) > 2: There should be enough characters after the last dot to form a two-character domain. I\'m not sure if the brackets are necessary.All email addresses contain an \'at\' symbol. Test that necessary conditionDon\'t bother with anything more complicated. Even if you could perfectly determine whether an email is RFC-syntactically valid, that wouldn\'t tell you whether it belongs to the person who supplied it. That\'s what really matters.To test that, send a validation message.This was stolen from http://codesnippets.joyent.com/posts/show/1917I\'m really looking forward to solve this problem.\nSo I modified email validation regular expression above Original\n/^(([^<>()\\[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@"]+(\\.[^<>()\\[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\\[[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z\\-0-9]+\\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/Modified\n/^(([^<>()\\[\\]\\.,;:\\s@\\"]+(\\.[^<>()\\[\\]\\.,;:\\s@\\"]+)*)|(\\".+\\"))@(([^<>()\\.,;\\s@\\"]+\\.{0,1})+[^<>()\\.,;:\\s@\\"]{2,})$/to pass the examples in Wikipedia Email Address.And you can see the result in here.Simply check out if the entered email address is valid or not using HTML.There isn\'t any need to write a function for validation.You should not use regular expressions to validate an input string to check if it\'s an email. It\'s too complicated and would not cover all the cases.Now since you can only cover 90% of the cases, write something like:You can refine it. For instance, \'aaa@\' is valid. But overall you get the gist. And don\'t get carried away... A simple 90% solution is better than 100% solution that does not work. The world needs simpler code...Do this (case insensitive)Why?  It\'s based on RFC 2822, which is a standard ALL email addresses MUST adhere to.Here\'s an example of it being use in JavaScriptNote: Technically some emails can include quotes in the section before the @ symbol with escape characters inside the quotes (so you\'re email user can be obnoxious and contain stuff like @ and "... as long as it\'s written in quotes) NOBODY DOES THIS EVER. It\'s obsolete. But, it IS included in the true RFC 2822 standard, and omitted here.More info: http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.htmlThis is how node-validator do it:Apparently, that\'s it:Taken from http://fightingforalostcause.net/misc/2006/compare-email-regex.php on Oct 1 \'10.But, of course, that\'s ignoring internationalization.In contrast to squirtle, here is a complex solution, but it does a mighty fine job of validating emails properly:Use like so:best regex ever which confirm RFC5322\n[a-z0-9!#$%&\'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\\.[a-z0-9!#$%&\'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])+\nIt\'s hard to get an email validator 100% correct. The only really way to get it correct would be to send a test email to the account. That said, there are a few basic checks that can help make sure that you\'re getting something reasonable.Some things to improve:Instead of new RegExp, just try writing the regexp out like this:Second, check to make sure that a period comes after the @ sign, and make sure that there are characters between the @s and periods. Here is a very good discussion about using regular expressions to validate email addresses; "Comparing E-mail Address Validating Regular Expressions"Here is the current top expression, that is JavaScript compatible, for reference purposes:My knowledge of regular expressions is not that good. That\'s why I check the general syntax with a simple regular expression first and check more specific options with other functions afterwards. This may not be not the best technical solution, but this way I\'m way more flexible and faster.The most common errors I\'ve come across are spaces (especially at the beginning and end) and occasionally a double dot.The regular expression provided by Microsoft within ASP.NET MVC isWhich I post here in case it\'s flawed - though it\'s always been perfect for my needs.Almost all answers to this questions suggest using Regex to validate emails addresses. I think Regex is only good for a rudimentary validation. It seems that the checking validation of email addresses is actually two separate problems:1- Validation of email format: Making sure if the email complies with the format and pattern of emails in RFC 5322 and if the TLD actually exists. A list of all valid TLDs can be found here.For example, although the address example@example.ccc will pass the regex, it is not a valid email, because ccc is not a top-level domain by IANA.2- Making sure the email actually exists: For doing this, you just need to send the users an email.Use this code inside your validator function:Else you can use jQuery. Inside rules define:Here is a function I use for front end email validation. (The Regular Expression came from parsley.js)The best practice is to either use HTML5 built-in email tag.or the common email syntax as recognizing @ and . from the string is given below. Note that this would still produce invalid email that will still match\n  the regex, its almost impossible to catch them all but this will\n  improve the situation a little.
