How do you left pad an int with zeros in java when converting to a string?I\'m basically looking to pad out integers up to 9999 with the leading zeros (e.g. 1 = "0001").Use java.lang.String.format(String,Object...) like this:for zero-padding with a length of 5. For hexadecimal output replace the d with an x as in "%05x".The full formatting options are documented as part of java.util.Formatter.If you for any reason use pre 1.5 Java then may try with Apache Commons Lang methodLet\'s say you want to print 11 as 011You could use a formatter: "%03d".You can use this formatter like this:Alternatively, some java methods directly support these formatters:Found this example... Will test...Tested this and:Both work, for  my purposes I think String.Format is better and more succinct.If performance is important in your case you could do it yourself with less overhead compared to the String.format function:PerformanceResultOwn function: 1697msString.format: 38134msYou can use Google Guava:Maven:Sample code:Note:Guava is very useful library, it also provides lots of features which related to Collections, Caches, Functional idioms, Concurrency, Strings, Primitives, Ranges, IO, Hashing, EventBus, etcRef: GuavaExplained Although many of the above approaches are good, but sometimes we need to format integers as well as floats. We can use this, particularly when we need to pad particular number of zeroes on left as well as right of decimal numbers.if you want to print the formatted text directly onto the screen.Check my code that will work for integer and String.Assume our first number is 2. And we want to add zeros to that so the the length of final string will be 4. For that you can use following codeThe only problem with this approach is that it makes you put on your thinking hat to figure out how it works.No packages needed:This will pad the string to three characters, and it is easy to add a part more for four or five. I know this is not the perfect solution in any way (especially if you want a large padded string), but I like it.
