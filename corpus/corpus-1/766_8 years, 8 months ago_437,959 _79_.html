I\'m loading elements via AJAX. Some of them are only visible if you scroll down the page.\nIs there any way I can know if an element is now in the visible part of the page?This should do the trick:Simple Utility Function\nThis will allow you to call a utility function that accepts the element you\'re looking for and if you want the element to be fully in view or partially.UsageThis answer in Vanilla:The best method I have found so far is the jQuery appear plugin. Works like a charm.Mimics a custom "appear" event, which fires when an element scrolls into view or otherwise becomes visible to the user.This plugin can be used to prevent unnecessary requests for content that\'s hidden or outside the viewable area.Here\'s my pure JavaScript solution that works if it\'s hidden inside a scrollable container too.Demo here (try resizing the window too)EDIT 2016-03-26: I\'ve updated the solution to account for scrolling past the element so it\'s hidden above the top of the scroll-able container.jQuery Waypoints plugin goes very nice here.There are some examples on the site of the plugin.WebResourcesDepot wrote a script to load while scrolling that uses jQuery some time ago. You can view their Live Demo Here. The beef of their functionality was this:Tweeked Scott Dowding\'s cool function for my requirement- \nthis is used for finding if the element has just scrolled into the screen i.e it\'s top edge .How aboutAfter that you can trigger whatever you want once the element is in view like this That works for me just fine isScrolledIntoView is a very needful function, so I tried it, it works for elements not heigher than the viewport, but if the element is bigger as the viewport it does not work. To fix this easily change the condition to this:See demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/RRSmQ/There is a plugin for jQuery called inview which adds a new "inview" event.Here is some code for a jQuery plugin that doesn\'t use events:I found this in a comment here ( http://remysharp.com/2009/01/26/element-in-view-event-plugin/ ) by a bloke called JamesThere is a rather nice example of this here (scroll down to the bottom):http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/2012/I can\'t be 100% sure that the example uses the same code, but...EDIT... I\'ve also written an extension to the inview plugin called \'exitview\' which fires an event when the element leaves the page. Anyone interested in the code can PM me, if that\'s possible.This considers any padding, border or margin the element has as well as elements larger than the viewport itself.To call it use something like this:Most answers here don\'t take into account that an element can also be hidden because it is scrolled out of view of a div, not only of the whole page.To cover that possibility, you basically have to check if the element is positioned inside the bounds of each of its parents.This solution does exactly that:It also lets you specify to what percentage it has to be visible in each direction.\nIt doesn\'t cover the possibility that it may be hidden due to other factors, like display: hidden.This should work in all major browsers, since it only uses getBoundingClientRect. I personally tested it in Chrome and Internet Explorer 11.I prefer using jQuery exprso you can use it this wayYou can easly add such code inside scroll event function etc. to check it everytime user will scroll the view.Plain vanilla to check if element (el) is visible in scrollable div (holder)Usage with jQuery:Building off of this great answer, you can simplify it a little further using ES2015+:If you don\'t care about the top going out of the window and just care that the bottom has been viewed, this can be simplified toor even the one-linerI have such a method in my application, but it does not use jQuery:Edit : This method works well for I.E. (at least version 6). Read the comments for compatibility with FF.If you want to tweak this for scrolling item within another div,I needed to check visibility in elements inside scrollable DIV containerThis method will return true if any part of the element is visible on the page. It worked better in my case and may help someone else.I adapted this short jQuery function extension, which you can feel free to use (MIT licence).An example based off of this answer to check if an element is 75% visible (i.e. less than 25% of it is off of the screen).Modified the accepted answer so that the element has to have it\'s display property set to something other than "none" to quality as visible.Here is another solution from http://web-profile.com.ua/See it in JSFiddleHere is a way to achieve the same thing using Mootools, in horizontal, vertical or both.Simple modification for scrollable div (container)NOTE: this does not work if the element is larger than the scrollable div.You can make use of jquery plugin "onScreen" to check if the element is in the current viewport when you scroll.\nThe plugin sets the ":onScreen" of the selector to true when the selector appears on the screen.\nThis is the link for the plugin which you can include in your project.\n    "http://benpickles.github.io/onScreen/jquery.onscreen.min.js"You can try the below example which works for me.HTML Code:CSS:I was looking for a way to see if the element is going to come into view soon, so by extending the snippets above i managed to do it. thought i would leave this here just in case it will help someoneelm = is the element you want to check is in the viewscrollElement = you can pass window or a parent element that has a scrolloffset = if you want it to fire when the element is 200px away before its in the screen then pass 200 There are over 30 answers to this question, and none of them use the amazingly simple, pure JS solution that I have been using. There is no need to load jQuery just to solve this, as many others are pushing.In order to tell if the element is within the viewport, we must first determine the elements position within the body. We do not need to do this recursively as I once thought. Instead, we can use element.getBoundingClientRect().This value is the Y difference between the top of the object and the top of the body.We then must tell if the element is within view. Most implementations ask if the full element is within the viewport, so this is what we shall cover.First of all, the top position of the window is: window.scrollY.We can get the bottom position of the window by adding the window\'s height to its top position:Lets create a simple function for getting the element\'s top position:This function will return the element\'s top position within the window or it will return 0 if you pass it something other than an element with the .getBoundingClientRect() method. This method has been around for a long time, so you shouldn\'t have to worry about your browser not supporting it.Now, our element\'s top position is:And or element\'s bottom position is:Now we can determine if the element is within the viewport by checking if the element\'s bottom position is lower than the viewport\'s top position and by checking if the element\'s top position is higher than the viewport\'s bottom position:From there, you can perform the logic to add or remove an in-view class on your element, which you can then handle later with transition effects in your CSS.I am absolutely amazed that I did not find this solution anywhere else, but I do believe that this is the cleanest and most effective solution, and it doesn\'t require you to load jQuery!Javascript only :)
