The CSS rules visibility:hidden and display:none both result in the element not being visible. Are these synonyms?display:none means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all (although you can still interact with it through the dom).  There will be no space allocated for it between the other tags.  visibility:hidden means that unlike display:none, the tag is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page. The tag is rendered, it just isn\'t seen on the page.For example:Replacing [style-tag-value] with display:none results in:Replacing [style-tag-value] with visibility:hidden results in:They are not synonyms.display:none removes the element from the normal flow of the page, allowing other elements to fill in.visibility:hidden leaves the element in the normal flow of the page such that is still occupies space.Imagine you are in line for a ride at an amusement park and someone in the line gets so rowdy that security plucks them from the line. Everyone in line will then move forward one position to fill the now empty slot. This is like display:none.Contrast this with the similar situation, but that someone in front of you puts on an invisibility cloak. While viewing the line, it will look like there is an empty space, but people can\'t really fill that empty looking space because someone is still there. This is like visibility:hidden.display:none removes the element from the layout flow.visibility:hidden hides it but leaves the space.One thing worth adding, though it wasn\'t asked, is that there is a third option of making the object completely transparent.  Consider:In this case you get:The difference between 1 and 2 has already been pointed out (namely, 2 still takes up space).  However, there is a difference between 2 and 3: in case 3, the mouse will still switch to the hand when hovering over the link, and the user can still click on the link, and Javascript events will still fire on the link. This is usually not the behavior you want. The behavior when selecting text can vary between browsers too.There is a big difference when it comes to child nodes. For example: If you have a parent div and a nested child div. So if you write like this:In this case none of the divs will be visible. But if you write like this:Then the child div will be visible whereas the parent div will not be shown.They\'re not synonyms - display: none removes the element from the flow of the page, and rest of the page flows as if it weren\'t there.visibility: hidden hides the element from view but not the page flow, leaving space for it on the page.display: none removes the element from the page entirely, and the page is built as though the element were not there at all.  Visibility: hidden leaves the space in the document flow even though you can no longer see it. This may or may not make a big difference depending on what you are doing.With visibility:hidden the object still takes up vertical height on the page. With display:none it is completely removed. If you have text beneath an image and you do display:none, that text will shift up to fill the space where the image was. If you do visibility:hidden the text will remain in the same location.display:none will hide the element and collapse the space is was taking up, whereas visibility:hidden will hide the element and preserve the elements space. display:none also effects some of the properties available from javascript in older versions of IE and Safari.If visibility property set to "hidden", the browser will still take space  on the page for the content even though it\'s invisible.\nBut when we set an object to "display:none", the browser does not allocate space on the page for its content.Example:View detailsIn addition to all other answers, there\'s an important difference for IE8: If you use display:none and try to get the element\'s width or height, IE8 returns 0 (while other browsers will return the actual sizes). IE8 returns correct width or height only for visibility:hidden. visibility:hidden will keep the element in the page and occupies that space but does not show to the user.display:none will not be available in the page and does not occupy any space.visibility:hidden hides an element, but it will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout.display:none hides an element, and it will not take up any space. The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there:visibility:hidden preserve the space, whereas display:none doesn\'t preserve the space.
