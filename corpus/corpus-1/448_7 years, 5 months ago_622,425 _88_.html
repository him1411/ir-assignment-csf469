Is it possible to upgrade all Python packages at one time with pip?Note that there is a feature request for this on the official issue tracker.There isn\'t a built-in flag yet, but you can useNote: there are infinite potential variations for this. I\'m trying to keep this answer short and simple, but please do suggest variations in the comments!Relevant edits:Newer versions of pip allow you to list outdated packages: Added -n1 to xargs, prevents stopping everything if updating one package fails (thanks @andsens)You can use the following Python code. Unlike pip freeze, this will not print warnings and FIXME errors.To upgrade all local packages; you could use pip-review:pip-review is a fork of pip-tools. See pip-tools issue mentioned by @knedlsepp. pip-review package works but pip-tools package no longer works.pip-review works on Windows since version 0.5.Works on Windows. Should be good for others too.\n($ is whatever directory you\'re in, in command prompt. eg. C:/Users/Username>)dothen doIf you have a problem with a certain package stalling the upgrade (numpy sometimes), just go to the directory ($), comment out the name (add a # before it) and run the upgrade again. You can later uncomment that section back.Windows version after consulting excellent documentation for FOR by Rob van der Woudefor /F "delims===" %i in (\'pip freeze -l\') do pip install -U %iYou can just print the packages that are outdatedThe following one-liner might prove of help:pip list --format legacy --outdated | sed \'s/(.*//g\' | xargs -n1 pip install -Uxargs -n1 keeps going if an error occurs. If you need more "fine grained" control over what is omitted and what raises an error you should not add the -n1 flag and explicitly define the errors to ignore, by "piping" the following line for each separate error:| sed \'s/^<First characters of the error>.*//\'Here is a working example:This option seems to me more straightforward and readable:(awk \'{ print $1}\' selects the first word of the line (separated by a space))And this version allows for the suppression of warning message from pip list --outdated:(awk \'!/<pattern>/\' removes line containing a given pattern. In my case the warning messages include "Could not" and "ignored" respectively)This could also be used to tackle the coming default columns format:This seems more concise.Explanation:pip list --outdated gets lines like theseIn cut -d \' \' -f1, -d \' \' sets "space" as the delimiter, -f1 means to get the first column. So the above lines becomes:then pass them to xargs to run the command, pip install -U, with each line as appending arguments-n1 limits the number of arguments passed to each command pip install -U to be 1From https://github.com/cakebread/yolk :however you need to get yolk first:One-liner version of @Ramana\'s answer.`when using a virtualenv and if you just want to upgrade packages added to your virtualenv, you may want to do:You can try this :I had the same problem with upgrading. Thing is, i never upgrade all packages. I upgrade only what i need, because project may break.Because there was no easy way for upgrading package by package, and updating the requirements.txt file, i wrote this pip-upgrader which also updates the versions in your requirements.txt file for the packages chosen (or all packages).InstallationUsageActivate your virtualenv (important, because it will also install the new versions of upgraded packages in current virtualenv).cd into your project directory, then run:Advanced usageIf the requirements are placed in a non-standard location, send them as arguments:If you already know what package you want to upgrade, simply send them as arguments:If you need to upgrade to  pre-release / post-release version, add --prerelease argument to your command.Full disclosure: I wrote this package.@Ramana\'s worked the best for me, of those here, but I had to add a few catches:The site-packages check excludes my development packages, because they are not located in the system site-packages directory. The try-except simply skips packages that have been removed from PyPI.@endolith: I was hoping for an easy pip.install(dist.key, upgrade=True), too, but it doesn\'t look like pip was meant to be used by anything but the command line (the docs don\'t mention the internal API, and the pip developers didn\'t use docstrings).Sent through a pull-request to the pip folk; in the meantime use this pip library solution I wrote:This seemed to work for me...I used printf with a space afterwards to properly separate the package names.The rather amazing yolk makes this easy.For more info on yolk: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yolk/0.4.3It can do lots of things you\'ll probably find useful.More Robust SolutionFor pip3 use this:For pip, just remove the 3s as such:OSX OddityOSX, as of July 2017, ships with a very old version of sed (a dozen years old).  To get extended regular expressions, use -E instead of -r in the solution above.Solving Issues with Popular SolutionsThis solution is well designed and tested1, whereas there are problems with even the most popular solutions.The above command uses the simplest and most portable pip syntax in combination with sed and sh to overcome these issues completely.  Details of sed operation can be scrutinized with the commented version2.Details[1] Tested and regularly used in a Linux 4.8.16-200.fc24.x86_64 cluster and tested on five other Linux/Unix flavors.  It also runs on Cygwin64 installed on Windows 10.  Testing on iOS is needed.[2] To see the anatomy of the command more clearly, this is the exact equivalent of the above pip3 command with comments: [3] Upgrading a Python or PIP component that is also used in the upgrading of a Python or PIP component can be a potential cause of a deadlock or package database corruption.Windows Powershell solutionMy script:Here is my variation on rbp\'s answer, which bypasses "editable" and development distributions. It shares two flaws of the original: it re-downloads and reinstalls unnecessarily; and an error on one package will prevent the upgrade of every package after that.Related bug reports, a bit disjointed after the migration from bitbucket:I have tried the code of Ramana and I found out on Ubuntu you have to write sudo for each command. Here is my script which works fine on ubuntu 13.10:here is another way of doing with a script in pythonIsn\'t this more effective?Here is a scripts that only updates the outdated packages.    I\'ve been using pur lately. It\'s simple and to the point. It updates your requirements.txt file to reflect the upgrades and you can then upgrade with your requirements.txt file as usual.or even:Works fast as it is not constantly launching a shell.  I would love to find the time to get this actually using the list outdated to speed things up still more.The simplest and fastest solution that I found in the pip issue discussion is:Source: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3819Here is my variation:
