I need to concatenate two String arrays in Java.What is the easiest way to do this?I found a one-line solution from the good old Apache Commons Lang library. ArrayUtils.addAll(T[], T...)Code:Here\'s a method that will concatenate 2 arrays of type Foo (replace Foo in the code with your classname in question).(source: Sun Forum )Here is a version that works with generics:Note like all generics it will not work with primitives but with Objects.It\'s possible to write a fully generic version that can even be extended to concatenate any number of arrays. This versions require Java 6, as they use Arrays.copyOf()Both versions avoid creating any intermediary List objects and use System.arraycopy() to ensure that copying large arrays is as fast as possible.For two arrays it looks like this:And for a arbitrary number of arrays (>= 1) it looks like this:One-liner in Java 8:Or:Or with the beloved Guava:Also, there are versions for primitive arrays:Using the Java API:A solution 100% old java and without System.arraycopy (not available in GWT client for example):I\'ve recently fought problems with excessive memory rotation. If a and/or b are known to be commonly empty, here is another adaption of silvertab\'s code (generified too):(In either case, array re-usage behaviour shall be clearly JavaDoced!)The Functional Java library has an array wrapper class that equips arrays with handy methods like concatenation....and thenTo get the unwrapped array back out, callHere\'s an adaptation of silvertab\'s solution, with generics retrofitted:NOTE: See Joachim\'s answer for a Java 6 solution. Not only does it eliminate the warning; it\'s also shorter, more efficient and easier to read!Another way with Java8 using StreamIf you use this way so you no need to import any third party class.If you want concatenate StringSample code for concate two String ArrayIf you want concatenate IntSample code for concate two Integer ArrayHere is Main methodWe can use this way also.Please forgive me for adding yet another version to this already long list. I looked at every answer and decided that I really wanted a version with just one parameter in the signature. I also added some argument checking to benefit from early failure with sensible info in case of unexpected input.You could try converting it into a Arraylist and use the addAll method then convert back to an array.Here a possible implementation in working code of the pseudo code solution written by silvertab. Thanks silvertab!Following next is the builder interface. Note: A builder is necessary because in java it is not possible to do new T[size] due to generic type erasure:Here a concrete builder implementing the interface, building a Integer array:And finally the application / test:Wow! lot of complex answers here including some simple ones that depend on external dependencies. how about doing it like this:This is a converted function for a String array:How about simply    And just do Array.concat(arr1, arr2). As long as arr1 and arr2 are of the same type, this will give you another array of the same type containing both arrays. Using only Javas own API:Now, this code ist not the most efficient, but it relies only on standard java classes and is easy to understand. It works for any number of String[] (even zero arrays).Here\'s my slightly improved version of Joachim Sauer\'s concatAll. It can work on Java 5 or 6, using Java 6\'s System.arraycopy if it\'s available at runtime. This method (IMHO) is perfect for Android, as it work on Android <9 (which doesn\'t have System.arraycopy) but will use the faster method if possible.Another way to think about the question. To concatenate two or more arrays, one have to do is to list all elements of each arrays, and then build a new array. This sounds like create a List<T> and then calls toArray on it. Some other answers uses ArrayList, and that\'s fine. But how about implement our own? It is not hard:I believe the above is equivalent to solutions that uses System.arraycopy. However I think this one has its own beauty. How about :A simple variation allowing the joining of more than one array:This works, but you need to insert your own error checking.\nIt\'s probably not the most efficient, but it doesn\'t rely on anything other than Java\'s own API.A type independent variation (UPDATED - thanks to Volley for instantiating T):If you\'d like to work with ArrayLists in the solution, you can try this:An easy, but inefficient, way to do this (generics not included):I found I had to deal with the case where the arrays can be null...
