What is the purpose of Node.js module.exports and how do you use it?I can\'t seem to find any information on this, but it appears to be a rather important part of Node.js as I often see it in source code.  According to the Node.js documentation:module A reference to the current\n  module. In particular module.exports\n  is the same as the exports object. See\n  src/node.js for more information.But this doesn\'t really help.What exactly does module.exports do, and what would a simple example be?module.exports is the object that\'s actually returned as the result of a require call.The exports variable is initially set to that same object (i.e. it\'s a shorthand "alias"), so in the module code you would usually write something like this:to export (or "expose") the internally scoped functions myFunc1 and myFunc2.And in the calling code you would use:where the last line shows how the result of require is (usually) just a plain object whose properties may be accessed.NB: if you overwrite exports then it will no longer refer to module.exports.  So if you wish to assign a new object (or a function reference) to exports then you should also assign that new object to module.exportsIt\'s worth noting that the name added to the exports object does not have to be the same as the module\'s internally scoped name for the value that you\'re adding, so you could have:followed by:This has already been answered but I wanted to add some clarification...You can use both exports and module.exports to import code into your application like this:var mycode = require(\'./path/to/mycode\');The basic use case you\'ll see (e.g. in ExpressJS example code) is that you set properties on the exports object in a .js file that you then import using require()So in a simple counting example, you could have:(counter.js):... then in your application (web.js, or really any other .js file):In simple terms, you can think of required files as functions that return a single object, and you can add properties (strings, numbers, arrays, functions, anything) to the object that\'s returned by setting them on exports.Sometimes you\'ll want the object returned from a require() call to be a function you can call, rather than just an object with properties. In that case you need to also set module.exports, like this:(sayhello.js):(app.js):The difference between exports and module.exports is explained better in this answer here.Note that the NodeJS module mechanism is based on CommonJS modules which are supported in many other implementations like RequireJS, but also SproutCore, CouchDB, Wakanda, OrientDB, ArangoDB, RingoJS, TeaJS, SilkJS, curl.js, or even Adobe Photoshop (via PSLib).\nYou can find the full list of known implementations here.Unless your module use node specific features or module, I highly encourage you then using exports instead of module.exports which is not part of the CommonJS standard, and then mostly not supported by other implementations.Another NodeJS specific feature is when you assign a reference to a new object to exports instead of just adding properties and methods to it like in the last example provided by Jed Watson in this thread. I would personally discourage this practice as this breaks the circular reference support of the CommonJS modules mechanism. It is then not supported by all implementations and Jed example should then be written this way (or a similar one) to provide a more universal module:(sayhello.js):(app.js):PS: It looks like Appcelerator also implements CommonJS modules, but without the circular reference support (see: Appcelerator and CommonJS modules (caching and circular references))Some few things you must take care if you assign a reference to a new object to exports and /or modules.exports:This one is obvious, but if you add an exported method at the beginning of an existing module, be sure the native exported object is not referencing another object at the endthe module.exports property or the exports object allows a module to select what should be shared with the applicationI have a video on module_export available hereWhen dividing your program code over multiple files, module.exports is used to publish variables and functions to the consumer of a module. The require() call in your source file is replaced with corresponding module.exports loaded from the module.Remember when writing modulesAccording to: "Modules Part 2 - Writing modules".the refer link is like this:the properties of exports or module.exports ,such as functions or variables , will be exposed outside there is something you must pay more attention : don\'t override exports .why ?because exports just the reference of module.exports , you can add the properties onto the exports ,but if you override the exports , the reference link will be broken .good example :bad example :If you just want to exposed only one function or variable , like this:this module only exposed one function and the property of name is private for the outside .There are some default or existing modules in node.js when you download and install node.js like http, sys etc. Since they are already in node.js, when we want to use these modules we basically do like import modules, but why? because they are already present in the node.js. Importing is like taking them from node.js and putting them into your program. And then using them.Whereas Exports is exactly the opposite, you are creating the module you want, let\'s say the module addition.js and putting that module into the node.js, you do it by exporting it.Before I write anything here, remember, module.exports.additionTwo is same as exports.additionTwoHuh, so that\'s the reason, we do likeBe careful with the pathLets say you have created an addition.js module, When you run this on your NODE.JS command prompt:This will error out saying Error: Cannot find module addition.jsThis is because the node.js process is unable the addition.js since we didn\'t mention the path. So, we have can set the path by using NODE_PATHNow, this should run successfully without any errors!!One more thing, you can also run the addition.js file by not setting the NODE_PATH, back to your nodejs command prompt:Since we are providing the path here by saying it\'s in the current directory ./ this should also run successfully.   A module encapsulates related code into a single unit of code. When creating a module, this can be interpreted as moving all related functions into a file. Suppose there is a file Hello.js which include two functionsWe write a function only when utility of the code is more than one call.Suppose we want to increase utility of the function to a different file say World.js,in this case exporting a file comes into picture which can be obtained by module.exports.You can just export both the function by the code given belowNow you just need to require the file name into World.js inorder to use those functions
