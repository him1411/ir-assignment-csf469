How do I append an object (such as a string or number) to an array in JavaScript?          Use the push() function to append to an array:Will printYou can use the push() function to append more than one value to an array in a single call:Will printUpdateIf you want to add the items of one array to another array, you can use Array.concat():Will printIf you\'re only appending a single variable, then push() works just fine. If you need to append another array, use concat():Will spit out:The concat does not affect ar1 and ar2 unless reassigned, for example:Will display:Lots of great info hereSome quick benchmarking (each test = 500k appended elements and the results are averages of multiple runs) showed the following:Firefox 3.6 (Mac):Safari 5.0 (Mac):Google Chrome 6.0 (Mac):I like the arr.push() syntax better, but I think I\'d be better off with the arr[arr.length] Version, at least in raw speed. I\'d love to see the results of an IE run though.My benchmarking loops:I think it\'s worth mentioning that push can be called with multiple arguments, which will be appended to the array in order. For example:As a result of this you can use push.apply to append an array to another array like so:Annotated ES5 has more info on exactly what push and apply do.2016 update: with spread, you don\'t need that apply anymore, like:You can use push and apply function to append two arrays.It will append array2 to array1. Now array1 contains [11, 32, 75, 99, 67, 34].\nThis code is much simpler than writing for loops to copy each and every items in the array.Use concat:a now contains all the elements, [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5].Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concatIf arr is an array, and val is the value you wish to add use:E.g.will log:With the new ES6 spread operator, joining two arrays using push becomes even easier:This adds the contents of arr2 onto the end of arr.Babel REPL ExampleIf you want to append two arrays -then you could use:And if you want to add record g to array  (var a=[]) then you could use:Javascript with ECMAScript 5 standard which is supported by most browsers now, you can use apply() to append array1 to array2.Javascript with ECMAScript 6 standard which is supported by Chrome and FF and IE Edge, you can use the spread operator:The spread operator will replace array2.push(...array1); with array2.push(3, 4, 5); when the browser is thinking the logic.Bonus pointIf you\'d like to create another variable to store all the items from both array, you can do this:ES5 var combinedArray = array1.concat(array2);ES6 const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2]The spread operator (...) is to spread out all items from a collection.The push() method adds new items to the end of an array, and returns the new length. Example:The exact answer to your question is already answered, but let\'s look at some other ways to add items to an array.The unshift() method adds new items to the beginning of an array, and returns the new length. Example:And lastly, the concat() method is used to join two or more arrays. Example:If you know the highest index (such as stored in a variable "i") then you can doHowever if you don\'t know then you can either use as other answers suggested, or you can useNote that the array is zero based so .length return the highest index plus one.Also note that you don\'t have to add in order and you can actually skip values, as inIn which case the values in between will have a value of undefined.It is therefore a good practice when looping through a JavaScript to verify that a value actually exists at that point.This can be done by something like the following:if you are certain that you don\'t have any zeros in the array then you can just do:Of course make sure in this case that you don\'t use as the condition myArray[i] (as some people over the internet suggest based on the end that as soon as i is greater then the highest index it will return undefined which evaluates to false)There are a couple of ways to append an array in JavaScript:1) The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.Output:2) The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array:Output:3) The concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.Output:4) You can use the array\'s .length property to add an element to the end of the array:Output:5) The splice() method changes the content of an array by removing existing elements and/or adding new elements:Output:6) You can also add a new element to an array simply by specifying a new index and assigning a value:Output:myarray.length returns the number of strings in the array.\nJS is zero based so the next element key of the array will be the current length of the array.\nEX:concat(), of course, can be used with 2 dimensional arrays as well. No looping required.var a = [\n      [1, 2],\n      [3, 4] ];var b = [\n      ["a", "b"],\n      ["c", "d"] ];b = b.concat(a); alert(b[2][1]); // result 2Just want to add a snippet for non-destructive addition of an element.Now, you can take advantage of ES6 syntax and just do:keeping the original array immutable.If you are using the ES6 you can use spread operator to do it.if you want to combine 2 arrays without the duplicate you may try the code belowusage:Output:\n[1,2,3,4,5]    If you want to append a single value into an array simply use the push method...\nIt will add a new element at the end of the array.\nBut if you intend to add multiple elements then store the elements in a new array\nand concat the second array with the first array...either way you wish.We don\'t have append function for Array in javascript, but we have push and unshift, imagine you have the array below:and we like append a value to this array, we can do, arr.push(6) and it will add 6 to the end of the array:also we can use unshift, look at how we can apply this:They are main functions to add or append new values to the arrays.You .push() that value in. \nExample: array.push(value);
