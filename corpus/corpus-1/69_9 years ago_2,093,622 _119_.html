How can I call an external command (as if I\'d typed it at the Unix shell or Windows command prompt) from within a Python script?Look at the subprocess module in the standard library:The advantage of subprocess vs system is that it is more flexible (you can get the stdout, stderr, the "real" status code, better error handling, etc...). The official docs recommend the subprocess module over the alternative os.system():The subprocess module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is preferable to using this function [os.system()].The "Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module" section in the subprocess documentation may have some helpful recipes.Official documentation on the subprocess module:Here\'s a summary of the ways to call external programs and the advantages and disadvantages of each:os.system("some_command with args") passes the command and arguments to your system\'s shell.  This is nice because you can actually run multiple commands at once in this manner and set up pipes and input/output redirection.  For example:  However, while this is convenient, you have to manually handle the escaping of shell characters such as spaces, etc.  On the other hand, this also lets you run commands which are simply shell commands and not actually external programs.  See the documentation.stream = os.popen("some_command with args") will do the same thing as os.system except that it gives you a file-like object that you can use to access standard input/output for that process.  There are 3 other variants of popen that all handle the i/o slightly differently.  If you pass everything as a string, then your command is passed to the shell; if you pass them as a list then you don\'t need to worry about escaping anything.  See the documentation.The Popen class of the subprocess module.  This is intended as a replacement for os.popen but has the downside of being slightly more complicated by virtue of being so comprehensive.  For example, you\'d say:instead of: but it is nice to have all of the options there in one unified class instead of 4 different popen functions.  See the documentation.The call function from the subprocess module.  This is basically just like the Popen class and takes all of the same arguments, but it simply waits until the command completes and gives you the return code.  For example:See the documentation.If you\'re on Python 3.5 or later, you can use the new subprocess.run function, which is a lot like the above but even more flexible and returns a CompletedProcess object when the command finishes executing.The os module also has all of the fork/exec/spawn functions that you\'d have in a C program, but I don\'t recommend using them directly.The subprocess module should probably be what you use.Finally please be aware that for all methods where you pass the final command to be executed by the shell as a string and you are responsible for escaping it. There are serious security implications if any part of the string that you pass can not be fully trusted. For example, if a user is entering some/any part of the string. If you are unsure, only use these methods with constants. To give you a hint of the implications consider this code:and imagine that the user enters "my mama didnt love me && rm -rf /".I typically use:You are free to do what you want with the stdout data in the pipe.  In fact, you can simply omit those parameters (stdout= and stderr=) and it\'ll behave like os.system().Some hints on detaching the child process from the calling one (starting the child process in background).Suppose you want to start a long task from a CGI-script, that is the child process should live longer than the CGI-script execution process.The classical example from the subprocess module docs is:The idea here is that you do not want to wait in the line \'call subprocess\' until the longtask.py is finished. But it is not clear what happens after the line \'some more code here\' from the example.My target platform was freebsd, but the development was on windows, so I faced the problem on windows first.On windows (win xp), the parent process will not finish until the longtask.py has finished its work. It is not what you want in CGI-script. The problem is not specific to Python, in PHP community the problems are the same.The solution is to pass DETACHED_PROCESS Process Creation Flag to the underlying CreateProcess function in win API.\nIf you happen to have installed pywin32 you can import the flag from the win32process module, otherwise you should define it yourself:/* UPD 2015.10.27 @eryksun in a comment below notes, that the semantically correct flag is CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE (0x00000010) */On freebsd we have another problem: when the parent process is finished, it finishes the child processes as well. And that is not what you want in CGI-script either. Some experiments showed that the problem seemed to be in sharing sys.stdout. And the working solution was the following:I have not checked the code on other platforms and do not know the reasons of the behaviour on freebsd. If anyone knows, please share your ideas. Googling on starting background processes in Python does not shed any light yet.I\'d recommend using the subprocess module instead of os.system because it does shell escaping for you and is therefore much safer: http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.htmlIf you want to return the results of the command, you can use os.popen. However, this is deprecated since version 2.6 in favor of the subprocess module, which other answers have covered well.Note that this is dangerous, since the command isn\'t cleaned. I leave it up to you to google for the relevant docs on the \'os\' and \'sys\' modules. There are a bunch of functions (exec* , spawn*) that will do similar things.Check the "pexpect" Python library, too.It allows for interactive controlling of external programs/commands, even ssh, ftp, telnet, etc. You can just type something like:I always use fabric for this things like:But this seem to be a good tool: sh (Python subprocess interface).Look an example:If what you need is the output from the command you are calling,\nthen you can use subprocess.check_output (Python 2.7+).Also note the shell parameter.If shell is True, the specified command will be executed through the shell. This can be useful if you are using Python primarily for the enhanced control flow it offers over most system shells and still want convenient access to other shell features such as shell pipes, filename wildcards, environment variable expansion, and expansion of ~ to a user\xe2\x80\x99s home directory. However, note that Python itself offers implementations of many shell-like features (in particular, glob, fnmatch, os.walk(), os.path.expandvars(), os.path.expanduser(), and shutil).This is how I run my commands. This code has everything you need pretty muchThere are lots of different libraries which allow you to call external commands with Python. For each library I\'ve given a description and shown an example of calling an external command. The command I used as the example is ls -l (list all files). If you want to find out more about any of the libraries I\'ve listed and linked the documentation for each of them.Sources:These are all the libraries:Hopefully this will help you make a decision on which library to use :)subprocessSubprocess allows you to call external commands and connect them to their input/output/error pipes (stdin, stdout, and stderr). Subprocess is the default choice for running commands, but sometimes other modules are better.osos is used for "operating system dependent functionality". It can also be used to call external commands with os.system and os.popen (Note: There is also a subprocess.popen). os will always run the shell and is a simple alternative for people who don\'t need to, or don\'t know how to use subprocess.run.shsh is a subprocess interface which lets you call programs as if they were functions. This is useful if you want to run a command multiple times.plumbumplumbum is a library for "script-like" Python programs. You can call programs like functions as in sh. Plumbum is useful if you want to run a pipeline without the shell.pexpectpexpect lets you spawn child applications, control them and find patterns in their output. This is a better alternative to subprocess for commands that expect a tty on Unix.fabricfabric is a Python 2.5 and 2.7 library. It allows you to execute local and remote shell commands. Fabric is simple alternative for running commands in a secure shell (SSH)envoyenvoy is known as "subprocess for humans". It is used as a convenience wrapper around the subprocess module.commandscommands contains wrapper functions for os.popen, but it has been removed from Python 3 since subprocess is a better alternative.The edit was based on J.F. Sebastian\'s comment.Use subprocess module:It is the recommended standard way. However, more complicated tasks (pipes, output, input, etc.) can be tedious to construct and write.Note: shlex.split can help you to parse the command for call and other subprocess functions in case you don\'t want (or you can\'t!) provide them in form of lists:If you do not mind external dependencies, use plumbum:It is the best subprocess wrapper. It\'s cross-platform, i.e. it works on both Windows and Unix-like systems. Install by pip install plumbum.Another popular library is sh:However, sh dropped Windows support, so it\'s not as awesome as it used to be. Install by pip install sh.subprocess.run is the recommended approach as of Python 3.5 if your code does not need to maintain compatibility with earlier Python versions. It\'s more consistent and offers similar ease-of-use as Envoy. (Piping isn\'t as straightforward though. See this question for how.)Here\'s some examples from the docs.Run a process:Raise on failed run:Capture output:I recommend trying Envoy. It\'s a wrapper for subprocess, which in turn aims to replace the older modules and functions. Envoy is subprocess for humans.Example usage from the readme:Pipe stuff around too:Without the output of the result:With output of the result:There is also Plumbumhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html...or for a very simple command:os.system is OK, but kind of dated.  It\'s also not very secure.  Instead, try subprocess.  subprocess does not call sh directly and is therefore more secure than os.system.Get more information here.os.system has been superseded by the subprocess module. Use subproccess instead.Use:os - This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.For the more os functions, here is the documentation.subprocess.check_call is convenient if you don\'t want to test return values. It throws an exception on any error.There is another difference here which is not mentioned above.subprocess.Popen executes the  as a subprocess. In my case, I need to execute file  which needs to communicate with another program . I tried subprocess, execution was successful. However  could not comm w/ .\neverything normal when I run both from the terminal.One more: \n(NOTE: kwrite behaves different from other apps. If you try below with firefox results will not be the same)If you try os.system("kwrite"), program flow freezes until user closes kwrite. To overcome that I tried instead os.system(konsole -e kwrite). This time program continued to flow but kwrite became the subprocess of the konsole.Anyone runs the kwrite not being a subprocess (i.e. at the system monitor it must be appear at the leftmost edge of the tree)os.system does not allow you to store results, so if you want to store results in some list or something subprocess.call works.I tend to use subprocess together with shlex (to handle escaping of quoted strings):Shameless plug, I wrote a library for this :P\nhttps://github.com/houqp/shell.pyIt\'s basically a wrapper for popen and shlex for now. It also supports piping commands so you can chain commands easier in Python. So you can do things like:You can use Popen, and then you can check the procedure\'s status:Check out subprocess.Popen.To fetch the network id from the openstack neutron:Output of nova net-listOutput of print(networkId)Under Linux, in case you would like to call an external command that will execute independently (will keep running after the python script terminates), you can use a simple queue as task spooler or the at commandAn example with task spooler:Notes about task spooler (ts): You could set the number of concurrent processes to be run ("slots") with:ts -S <number-of-slots>Installing ts doesn\'t requires admin privileges. You can download and compile it from source with a simple make, add it to your path and you\'re done.Here are my two cents: In my view, this is the best practice when dealing with external commands...These are the return values from the execute method...This is the execute method...In Windows you can just import the subprocess module and run external commands by calling subprocess.Popen(), subprocess.Popen().communicate() and subprocess.Popen().wait() as below:Output:
