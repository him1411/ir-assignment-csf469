This question already has an answer here:So I have difficulty with the concept of *args and **kwargs.So far I have learned that:??To be honest I don\'t understand and don\'t get for what programming task this would helpful. (I am sure there is, but I can\'t get an understanding of it.)Maybe:I think to enter lists and dictionaries as arguments of a function AND at the same time as a wildcard, so I can pass ANY argument?Is there a simple example on which to explain how *args and **kwargs are used?Also the tutorial I run through used just the "*" and a variable name. Is *args and **kwargs just a placeholder or do you use exactly *args and **kwargs in the code?The syntax is the * and **.  The names *args and **kwargs are only by convention but there\'s no hard requirement to use them.You would use *args when you\'re not sure how many arguments might be passed to your function, i.e. it allows you pass an arbitrary number of arguments to your function.  For example:Similarly, **kwargs allows you to handle named arguments that you have not defined in advance:You can use these along with named arguments too.  The explicit arguments get values first and then everything else is passed to *args and **kwargs.  The named arguments come first in the list.  For example:You can also use both in the same function definition but *args must occur before **kwargs.You can also use the * and ** syntax when calling a function.  For example:As you can see in this case it takes the list (or tuple) of items and unpacks it. By this it matches them to the arguments in the function.  Of course, you could have a * both in the function definition and in the function call.One place where the use of *args and **kwargs is quite useful is for subclassing.This way you can extend the behaviour of the Foo class, without having to know too much about Foo. This can be quite convenient if you are programming to an API which might change. MyFoo just passes all arguments to the Foo class.Here\'s an example that uses 3 different types of parameters.Here\'s one of my favorite places to use the ** syntax as in Dave Webb\'s final example:I\'m not sure if it\'s terribly fast when compared to just using the names themselves, but it\'s a lot easier to type!One case where *args and **kwargs are useful is when writing wrapper functions (such as decorators) that need to be able accept arbitrary arguments to pass through to the function being wrapped.  For example, a simple decorator that prints the arguments and return value of the function being wrapped:*args and **kwargs are special-magic features of Python.\nThink of a function that could have an unknown number of arguments. For example, for whatever reasons, you want to have function that sums an unknown number of numbers (and you don\'t want to use the built-in sum function). So you write this function:and use it like: sumFunction(3,4,6,3,6,8,9).**kwargs has a diffrent function. With **kwargs you can give arbitrary keyword arguments to a function and you can access them as a dictonary.Calling someFunction(text="foo") will print foo.Just imagine you have a function but you don\'t want to restrict the number of parameter it takes.\nExample:Then you use this function like:The names *args and **kwargs or **kw are purely by convention. It makes it easier for us to read each other\'s codeOne place it is handy is when using the struct modulestruct.unpack() returns a tuple whereas struct.pack() uses a variable number of arguments. When manipulating data it is convenient to be able to pass a tuple to struck.pack() eg.without this ability you would be forced to writewhich also means the if the format_str changes and the size of the tuple changes, I\'ll have to go back and edit that really long lineNote that *args/**kwargs is part of function-calling syntax, and not really an operator. This has a particular side effect that I ran into, which is that you can\'t use *args expansion with the print statement, since print is not a function.This seems reasonable:Unfortunately it doesn\'t compile (syntax error).This compiles:But prints the arguments as a tuple, which isn\'t what we want.This is the solution I settled on:These parameters are typically used for proxy functions, so the proxy can pass any input parameter to the target function.But since these parameters hide the actual parameter names, it is better to avoid them.You can have a look at python docs (docs.python.org in the FAQ), but more specifically for a good explanation the mysterious miss args and mister kwargs (courtesy of archive.org) (the original, dead link is here).In a nutshell, both are used when optional parameters to a function or method are used. \nAs Dave says, *args is used when you don\'t know how many arguments may be passed, and **kwargs when you want to handle parameters specified by name and value as in:
