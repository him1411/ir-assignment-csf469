I want to delete a branch both locally and on my remote project fork on GitHub.What do I need to do differently to successfully delete the\nremotes/origin/bugfix branch both locally and on GitHub?To delete the local branch use one of the following:Note: The -d option is an alias for --delete, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch. You could also use -D, which is an alias for --delete --force, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status." [Source: man git-branch] As of Git v1.7.0, you can delete a remote branch usingwhich might be easier to remember thanwhich was added in Git v1.5.0 "to delete a remote branch or a tag."Starting on Git v2.8.0 you can also use git push with the -d option as an alias for --delete.Therefore, the version of Git you have installed will dictate whether you need to use the easier or harder syntax.From Chapter 3 of Pro Git by Scott Chacon:Suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re done with a remote branch \xe2\x80\x94 say, you and your collaborators are finished with a feature and have merged it into your remote\xe2\x80\x99s master branch (or whatever branch your stable codeline is in). You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax git push [remotename] :[branch]. If you want to delete your serverfix branch from the server, you run the following:Boom. No more branch on your server. You may want to dog-ear this page, because you\xe2\x80\x99ll need that command, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely forget the syntax. A way to remember this command is by recalling the git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch] syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the [localbranch] portion, then you\xe2\x80\x99re basically saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTake nothing on my side and make it be [remotebranch].\xe2\x80\x9dI issued git push origin :bugfix and it worked beautifully. Scott Chacon was right\xe2\x80\x94I will want to dog ear that page (or virtually dog ear by answering this on StackÂ Overflow).Then you should execute this on other machinesto propagate changes.Matthew\'s answer is great for removing remote branches and I also appreciate the explanation, but to make a simple distinction between the two commands:To remove a local branch from your machine:git branch -d {the_local_branch} (use -D instead to force deletion without checking merged status)To remove a remote branch from the server:git push origin --delete {the_remote_branch}Reference: https://makandracards.com/makandra/621-git-delete-a-branch-local-or-remoteIf you want more detailed explanations of the following commands, then see the long answers in the next section.Deleting a remote branch:Deleting a local branch:Deleting a local remote-tracking branch:When you\'re dealing with deleting branches both locally and remotely, keep in mind that there are 3 different branches involved:The original poster usedwhich only deleted his local remote-tracking branch origin/bugfix, and not the actual remote branch bugfix on origin.To delete that actual remote branch, you needThe following sections describe additional details to consider when deleting your remote and remote-tracking branches.Note that deleting the remote branch X from the command line using a git push will also delete the local remote-tracking branch origin/X, so it is not necessary to prune the obsolete remote-tracking branch with git fetch --prune or git fetch -p, though it wouldn\'t hurt if you did it anyway.You can verify that the remote-tracking branch origin/X was also deleted by running the following:If you didn\'t delete your remote branch X from the command line (like above), then your local repo will still contain (a now obsolete) remote-tracking branch origin/X. This can happen if you deleted a remote branch directly through GitHub\'s web interface, for example.A typical way to remove these obsolete remote-tracking branches (since Git version 1.6.6) is to simply run git fetch with the --prune or shorter -p. Note that this removes all obsolete local remote-tracking branches for any remote branches that no longer exist on the remote:Here is the relevant quote from the 1.6.6 release notes (emphasis mine):"git fetch" learned --all and --multipleoptions, to run fetch from\n  many repositories, and --prune option to remove remote tracking\n  branches that went stale.  These make "git remote update" and "git\n  remote prune" less necessary (there is no plan to remove "remote\n  update" nor "remote prune", though).Alternatively, instead of pruning your obsolete local remote-tracking branches through git fetch -p, you can avoid making the extra network operation by just manually removing the branch(es) with the --remote or -r flags:You can also use the following to delete the remote branch.Which does the same thing asbut it may be easier to remember.If you want to delete a branch, first checkout to the branch other than the branch to be deleted.Deleting the local branch:Deleting the remote branch:Tip: When you delete branches usingoronly the references are deleted. Even though the branch is actually removed on the remote the references to it still exists in the local repositories of your team members. This means that for other team members the deleted branches are still visible when they do a git branch -a.To solve this your team members can prune the deleted branches withThis is typically git remote prune origin.for deleting the origin branch:for deleting the local:Explain: OK, just explain what\'s going on!Simply do git push origin --delete to delete your remote branch, add the name of the branch at the end... and this will delete and push it to remote at the same time...Also, git branch -D, which simply delete the local branch Only!...-D stands for --delete --force which will delete the branch even it\'s not merged(force delete), but you also can use -d which stands for --delete which throw an error respective of the branch merge status...I also create the image below to show the steps:This is simple: Just run the following command:To delete a Git branch both locally and remotely, first delete the local branch using command:(here example is the branch name)And after that delete remote branch using command:Another approach isWARNING: This will delete all remote branches that do not exist locally. Or more comprehensively,will effectively make the remote repository look like the local copy of the repository (local heads, remotes and tags are mirrored on remote).I use the following in my Bash settings:Then you can call:Since January 2013, GitHub included a Delete branch button next to each branch in your "Branches" page.Relevant blog post: Create and delete branchesIf you want to complete both these steps with a single command, you can make an alias for it by adding the below to your ~/.gitconfig:Alternatively, you can add this to your global config from the command line usingNOTE: If using -d (lowercase d), the branch will only be deleted if it has been merged. To force the delete to happen, you will need to use -D (uppercase D).Delete locally:To delete a local branch, you can use:To delete a branch forcibly, use -D instead of -d. Delete remotely:There are two options:I would suggest you use the 2nd way as it is more intuitive.You can also do this using git remote prune origin:It prunes and deletes remote-tracking branches from a git branch -r listing.To delete your branch locally and remotely Checkout to master branchgit checkout masterDelete your remote branchgit push origin --delete <branch-name>git branch --delete <branch-name>In addition to the other answers, I often use the git_remote_branch tool. It\'s an extra install, but it gets you a convenient way to interact with remote branches. In this case, to delete:I find that I also use the publish and track commands quite often.Deleting BranchesLet\'s assume our work on branch "contact-form" is done and we\'ve already integrated it into "master". Since we don\'t need it anymore, we can delete it (locally):And for deleting the remote branch:Delete remote branchgit push origin :<branchname>Delete local branchgit branch -D <branchname>Delete local branch steps:One liner command delete both local, and remote:D=branch-name; git branch -D $D; git push origin :$Dor add the alias below to your ~/.gitconfig; usage: git kill branch-nameSimply say:Now you can do it with the GitHub Desktop app.After launching the appis easier to remember thanThis won\'t work if you have a tag with the same name as the branch on the remote:In that case you need to specify that you want to delete the branch, not the tag:Similarly, to delete the tag instead of the branch you would use:Many of the other answers will lead to errors/warnings. This approach is relatively fool proof although you may still need git branch -D branch_to_delete if it\'s not fully merged into some_other_branch, for example.Remote pruning isn\'t needed if you deleted the remote branch. It\'s only used to get the most up to date remotes available on a repo you\'re tracking. I\'ve observed git fetch will add remotes, not remove them. Here\'s an example of when git remote prune origin will actually do something:User A does the steps above. User B would run the following commands to see the most up to date remote branchesI got sick of googling for this answer, so I took a similar approach\nto the answer that crizCraig posted earlier.Added the following to my Bash profile:Then every time I\'m done with a branch (merged into master, for example) I run the following in my terminal:...which then deletes my-branch-name from origin as as well as locally.Mashup of all the other answers. Requires Ruby 1.9.3+, tested only on OS X.Call this file git-remove, make it executable, and put it in your path. Then use, for example, git remove temp. If you are sure you want to delete it, run Now to clean up deleted remote branches runBefore executingmake sure you determine first what the EXACT name of the remote branch is by executing:This will tell you what to enter EXACTLY for <branch> value. (branch is case sensitive!)I added the following aliases to my .gitconfig file.  This allows me to delete branches with or without specifying the branch name.  Branch name is defaulted to the current branch if no argument is passed in.
