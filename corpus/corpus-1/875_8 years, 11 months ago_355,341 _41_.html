How do you use the CSS content property to add html entities?I have a number of links which I make into a breadcrumb style list by adding an arrow before each.Which has the following style applied to it:The problem is that when the breadcrumb list gets long and wraps to the next line, the arrow is left on the preceding line. The obvious solution is to change the space into a non-breaking space, but this doesn\'t work:It actually outputs &nbsp; onto the screen. I\'ve got around this with other strange characters (like ») by pasting the character in directly, but how do you paste a &nbsp; ?You have to use the escaped unicode :Like More info on : http://www.evotech.net/blog/2007/04/named-html-entities-in-numeric-order/CSS is not HTML.  &nbsp; is a character entity reference in HTML; a stand-in for the character reference &#160;.  160 is the decimal code point of the NO-BREAK SPACE character in Unicode (actually, UCS-2; see the HTML 4.01 Specification).  The hexadecimal representation of that code point is U+00A0 (160 = 10 \xc3\x97 161 + 0 \xc3\x97 160). You will find that in the Unicode Code Charts and Character Database.In CSS you need to use a Unicode escape sequence for such characters, which is based on the hexadecimal value of the code point of a character. So you need to writeThis works as long as the escape sequence comes last in a string value.  If characters follow, there are two ways to avoid misinterpretation:a) (mentioned by others) Use exactly six hexadecimal digits for the escape sequence:b) Add one white-space (e. g., space) character after the escape sequence:(Since f is a hexadecimal digit, \\a0f would otherwise mean GURMUKHI LETTER EE here, or \xe0\xa8\x8f if you have a suitable font.)The delimiting white-space will be ignored, and this will be displayed >\xc2\xa0foo, where the displayed space here would be a NO-BREAK SPACE character.The white-space approach (\'\\a0 foo\') has the following advantages over the six-digit approach (\'\\0000a0foo\'):Thus, to display a space after an escaped character, use two spaces in the stylesheet \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93 or make it explicit:See CSS 2.1, section "4.1.3 Characters and case" for details.Update: PointedEars mentions that the correct stand in for &nbsp; in all css situations would be\n\'\\a0 \' implying that the space is a terminator to the hex string and is absorbed by the escaped sequence.  He further pointed out this authoritative description which sounds like a good solution to the problem I described and fixed below.What you need to do is use the escaped unicode. Despite what you\'ve been told \\00a0 is not a perfect stand-in for &nbsp; within CSS; so try:Specifically using \\0000a0 as &nbsp;.\nIf you try, as suggested by mathieu and millikin:It takes the B into the hex escaped characters. The same occurs with 0-9a-fA-F.Use the hex code for a non-breaking space. Something like this:I found that the easiest way to convert symbols, such as from ▾ (&#9662;) to \\25BE is to use the Microsoft calculator =)Yes. Enable programmers mode, turn on the decimal system, enter 9662, then switch to hex and you\'ll get 25BE. Then just add a backslash \\ to the beginning.There is a way to paste an nbsp - open CharMap and copy character 160. However, in this case I\'d probably space it out with padding, like this:You might need to set the breadcrumbs display:inline-block or something, though.For Example : http://character-code.com/arrows-html-codes.php Example: If you want select your character , I selected "&#8620" "&#x21ac" (We use HEX values)Result : ↬Thats it :)Here are two ways: In HTML:<div class="ics">&#9969;</div>This will result into \n   ⛱In Css:.ics::before {content: \\9969;}with HTML code <div class="ics"></div>This also results in ⛱
