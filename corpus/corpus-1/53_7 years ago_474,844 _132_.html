This is a collection of questions that come up every now and then about syntax in PHP. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in maintaining this list. It used to be hard to find questions about operators and other syntax tokens.\xc2\xb9\nThe main idea is to have links to existing questions on Stack Overflow, so it\'s easier for us to reference them, not to copy over content from the PHP Manual.\xc2\xb9 Note: Since January 2013, Stack Overflow does support special characters. Just surround the search terms by quotes, e.g. [php] "==" vs "==="If you have been pointed here by someone because you have asked such a question, please find the particular syntax below. The linked pages to the PHP manual along with the linked questions will likely answer your question then. If so, you are encouraged to upvote the answer. This list is not meant as a substitute to the help others provided.If your particular token is not listed below, you might find it in the List of Parser Tokens.& Bitwise Operators or References=& References&= Bitwise Operators&& Logical Operators% Arithmetic Operators!!

Argument unpacking (since PHP 5.6)** Exponentiation (since PHP 5.6)# One-line shell-style commentIncrementing / Decrementing Operators++ increment operator-- decrement operatorThese can go before or after the variable.If put before the variable, the increment/decrement operation is done to the variable first then the result is returned. If put after the variable, the variable is first returned, then the increment/decrement operation is done.For example:Live exampleIn the case above ++$i is used, since it is faster. $i++ would have the same results.Pre-increment is a little bit faster, because it really increments the variable and after that \'returns\' the result. Post-increment creates a special variable, copies there the value of the first variable and only after the first variable is used, replaces its value with second\'s.However, you must use $apples--, since first you want to display the current number of apples, and then you want to subtract one from it.You can also increment letters in PHP:Once z is reached aa is next, and so on.Note that character variables can be incremented but not decremented and even so only plain ASCII characters (a-z and A-Z) are supported.Stack Overflow Posts:What is a bit? A bit is a representation of 1 or 0. Basically OFF(0) and ON(1)What is a byte? A byte is made up of 8 bits and the highest value of a byte is 255, which would mean every bit is set. We will look at why a byte\'s maximum value is 255.This representation of 1 Byte1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255 (1 Byte) This would output the number 8. Why? Well let\'s see using our table example.So you can see from the table the only bit they share together is the 8 bit.Second exampleThe two shared bits are 32 and 4, which when added together return 36.This would output the number 11. Why?You will notice that we have 3 bits set, in the 8, 2, and 1 columns. Add those up: 8+2+1=11._ Alias for gettext() The underscore character \'_\' as in _() is an alias to gettext(). Magic constants: Although these are not just symbols but important part of this token family. There are eight magical constants that change depending on where they are used.__LINE__: The current line number of the file.__FILE__: The full path and filename of the file. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned. Since PHP 4.0.2, __FILE__ always contains an absolute path with symlinks resolved whereas in older versions it contained relative path under some circumstances.__DIR__: The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to dirname(__FILE__). This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory. (Added in PHP 5.3.0.)__FUNCTION__: The function name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the function name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased.__CLASS__: The class name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the class name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased. The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\\Bar). Note that as of PHP 5.4 __CLASS__ works also in traits. When used in a trait method, __CLASS__ is the name of the class the trait is used in.__TRAIT__: The trait name. (Added in PHP 5.4.0) As of PHP 5.4 this constant returns the trait as it was declared (case-sensitive). The trait name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\\Bar).__METHOD__: The class method name. (Added in PHP 5.0.0) The method name is returned as it was declared (case-sensitive).__NAMESPACE__: The name of the current namespace (case-sensitive). This constant is defined in compile-time (Added in PHP 5.3.0).SourceThe spaceship operator <=> is the latest comparison operator added in PHP 7. It is a non-associative binary operator with the same precedence as equality operators (==, !=, ===, !==). This operator allows for simpler three-way comparison between left-hand and right-hand operands.The operator results in an integer expression of:e.g.A good practical application of using this operator would be in comparison type callbacks that are expected to return a zero, negative, or positive integer based on a three-way comparison between two values. The comparison function passed to usort is one such example.instanceof is used to determine whether a PHP variable is an instantiated object of a certain class.The above example will output:Reason: Above Example $a is a object of the mclass so use only a mclass data not instance of with the sclassThe above example will output:The above example will output:and operator and or operator have lower precedence than assignment operator =. This means that $a = true and false; is equivalent to ($a = true) and false.In most cases you will probably want to use && and ||, which behave in a way known from languages like C, Java or JavaScript.Examples for <=> Spaceship operator (PHP 7, Source: PHP Manual):Integers, Floats, Strings, Arrays & objects for Three-way comparison of variables.{} Curly bracesAnd some words about last postPHP Strings:\nPHP Strings can be specified in four ways not just two ways:1) Single Quote Strings: 2) Double Quote Strings: 3) Heredoc: 4) Nowdoc (since PHP 5.3.0): QUESTION:What does => mean?ANSWER: => Is the symbol we humans decided to use to separate "Key" => "Value" pairs in Associative Arrays. ELABORATING:To understand this, we have to know what Associative Arrays are. The first thing that comes up when a conventional programmer thinks of an array (in PHP) would be something similar to:Where as, if we wanted to call the array in some later part of the code, we could do:So far so good. However, as humans, we might find it hard to remember that index [0] of the array is the value of the year 2016, index [1] of the array is a greetings, and index [2] of the array is a simple integer value. The alternative we would then have is to use what is called an Associative Array. An Associative array has a few differences from a Sequential Array\n(which is what the previous cases were since they increment the index used in a predetermined sequence, by incrementing by 1 for each following value).Differences (between a sequential and associative array):Durring the declaration of an Associative Array, you don\'t only include the value of what you want to put in the array, but you also put the index value (called the key) which you want to use when calling the array in later parts of the code. The following syntax is used during it\'s declaration: "key" => "value". When using the Associative Array, the key value would then be placed inside the index of the array to retrieve the desired value.For instance:And now, to receive the same output as before, the key value would be used in the arrays index:FINAL POINT:So from the above example, it is pretty easy to see that the => symbol is used to express the relationship of an Associative Array between each of the key and value pairs in an array DURING the initiation of the values within the array.Null coalescing operator (??)This operator has been added in PHP 7.0 for the common case of needing to use a ternary operator in conjunction with isset(). It returns its first operand if it exists and is not NULL; otherwise it returns its second operand.Question:What does "&" mean here in PHP?Makes life more easier once we get used to it..(check example below carefully)& usually checks bits that are set in both $a and $b are set.have you even noticed how these calls works?So behind all above is game of bitwise operator and bits.One usefull case of these is easy configurations like give below, so a single integer field can store thousands of combos for you. Most people have already read the docs but didn\'t reliase the real world use case of these bitwise operators.Null Coalesce Operator phpThe null coalescing operator (??) has been added to PHP7 for the common case of needing to use a ternary in conjunction with isset(). It returns its first operand if it exists and is not NULL otherwise it returns its second operand, such as following example:
