How do I generate a random int number in C#?The Random class is used to create random numbers. (Pseudo-random that is of course.).Example:If you are going to create more than one random number, you should keep the Random instance and reuse it. If you create new instances too close in time, they will produce the same series of random numbers as the random generator is seeded from the system clock.Every time you do new Random() it is initialized . This means that in a tight loop you get the same value lots of times. You should keep a single Random instance and keep using Next on the same instance.The question looks very simple but the answer is  bit complicated. If you see almost everyone has suggested to use the Random class and some have suggested to use the RNG crypto class. But then when to choose what. For that we need to first understand the term RANDOMNESS and the philosophy behind it.I would encourage you to watch this video which goes in depth in the philosophy of RANDOMNESS using C# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCYxc-2-3fY First thing let us understand the philosophy of RANDOMNESS.  When we tell a person to choose between RED ,  GREEN and YELLOW  what happens internally. What makes a person choose RED or YELLO or GREEN ?. Some initial thought goes in to the persons mind which decides his choice , it can be favorite color , lucky color and so on. In other words some initial trigger which we term in RANDOM as SEED.This SEED is the beginning point , the trigger which instigates him to select the RANDOM value.Now if a SEED is easy to guess then those kind of random numbers are termed as PSEUDO and when a seed is difficult to guess those random numbers are termed  SECURED random numbers. For example a person chooses is color depending on weather and sound combination then  it would be difficult to guess the initial seed.Now let me make an important statement:-*\xe2\x80\x9cRandom\xe2\x80\x9d class generates only PSEUDO random number and to generate SECURE random number we need to use \xe2\x80\x9cRNGCryptoServiceProvider\xe2\x80\x9d class.Random class takes seed values from your CPU clock which is very much predictable.  So in other words RANDOM class of C# generates pseudo random numbers , below is the code for the same.While the RNGCryptoServiceProvider  class uses OS entropy to generate seeds. OS entropy is a random value which is generated using sound , mouse click  and keyboard timings , thermal temp etc. Below goes the code for the same.To understand OS entropy see this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCYxc-2-3fY   from 11:20 where the logic of OS entropy is explained. So putting in simple words RNG Crypto generates SECURE random numbers.Beware that new Random() is seeded on current timestamp.If you want to generate just one number you can use:new Random().Next( int.MinValue, int.MaxValue + 1 )For more information, look at the Random class, though please note:However, because the clock has finite resolution, using the parameterless constructor to create different Random objects in close succession creates random number generators that produce identical sequences of random numbersSo do not use this code to generate a series of random number.it\'s better to seed the Random object with current milliseconds, to ensure true random number, and you almost won\'t find duplicates using it many timesI wanted to add a cryptographically secure version: RNGCryptoServiceProvider Class (MSDN or dotnetperls)It implements IDisposable.You could use Jon Skeet\'s StaticRandom method inside the MiscUtil class library that he built for a pseudo-random number. I\'ve tried all of these solutions excluding the COBOL answer... lolNone of these solutions were good enough. I needed randoms in a fast for int loop and I was getting tons of duplicate values even in very wide ranges. After settling for kind of random results far too long I decided to finally tackle this problem once and for all. It\'s all about the seed. I create a random integer by parsing out the non-digits from Guid, then I use that to instantiate my Random class.Update: Seeding isn\'t necessary if you instantiate the Random class once. So it\'d be best to create a static class and call a method off that.Then you can use the static class like so..I admit I like this approach better.I use below code to have a random number:Modified answer from here.If you have access to an Intel Secure Key compatible CPU, you can generate real random numbers and strings using these libraries: https://github.com/JebteK/RdRand and https://www.rdrand.com/Just download the latest version from here, include Jebtek.RdRand and add a using statement for it. Then, all you need to do is this:If you don\'t have a compatible CPU to execute the code on, just use the RESTful services at rdrand.com. With the RdRandom wrapper library included in your project, you would just need to do this (you get 1000 free calls when you signup):The numbers generated by the inbuilt Random class (System.Random) generates pseudo random numbers.If you want true random numbers, the closest we can get is "secure Pseudo Random Generator" which can be generated by using the Cryptographic classes in C# such as RNGCryptoServiceProvider.Even so, if you still need true random numbers you will need to use an external source such as devices accounting for radioactive decay as a seed for an random number generator. Since, by definition, any number generated by purely algorithmic means cannot be truly random. Put whatever values you want in the second parentheses\nmake sure you have set a name by writing prop and double tab to generate the codeWhile this is okay:You\'d want to control the limit (min and max mumbers) most of the time. So you need to specify where the random number starts and ends.The Next() method accepts two parameters, min and max.So if i want my random number to be between say 5 and 15, I\'d just dohttp://pastebin.com/P79GXiVh is the class I use. Works like RandomNumber.GenerateRandom(1, 666)Numbers calculated by a computer through a deterministic process, cannot, by definition, be random.If you want a genuine random numbers, the randomness comes from atmospheric noise or radioactive decay.You can try for example RANDOM.ORG (it reduces performance)I wanted to demonstrate what happens when a new random generator is used every time. Suppose you have two methods or two classes each requiring a random number. And naively you code them like:Do you think you will get two different IDs? NOPEThe solution is to always use a single static random generator. Like this:Try these simple steps to create random numbers:create functionUse the above function in a location where you want to use random numbers. Suppose you want to use it in a text box.0 is min and 999 is max. You can change the values to whatever you want.Also check the answer on this page.(http://solutions.musanitech.com/c-how-to-create-random-numbers/)Why not use int randomNumber = Random.Range(start_range, end_range) ?I hope this code might be helpfulPlay with it...hopefully you can get what you wantyou can also give minimum and maximum value to Next() function.
