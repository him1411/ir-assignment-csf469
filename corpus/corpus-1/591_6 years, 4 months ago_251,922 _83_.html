I have many Git branches. How do I delete branches which have already been merged? Is there an easy way to delete them all instead of deleting them one by one?UPDATE:You can add other branches to exclude like master and dev if your workflow has those as a possible ancestor. Usually I branch off of a "sprint-start" tag and master, dev and qa are not ancestors.To delete all local branches that are already merged into the currently checked out branch:You can see that master and dev are excluded in case they are an ancestor.You can delete a merged local branch with:If it\'s not merged, use:To delete it from the remote in old versions of Git use:In more recent versions of Git use:Once you delete the branch from the remote, you can prune to get rid of remote tracking branches with:or prune individual remote tracking branches, as the other answer suggests, with:Hope this helps.To delete all branches on remote that are already merged:In more recent versions of GitJust extending Adam\'s answer a little bit:Add this to your Git configuration by running git config -e --globalAnd then you can delete all the local merged branches doing a simple git cleanup.This also works to delete all merged branches except master.You\'ll want to exclude the master & develop branches from those commands.Local git clear:  Remote git clear:  Sync local registry of remote branches:  For those of you that are on Windows and prefer PowerShell scripts, here is one that deletes local merged branches:Git Sweep does a great job of this.You can add the commit to the --merged option.\nThis way you can make sure only to remove branches which are merged into i.e. the origin/masterFollowing command will remove merged branches from your origin.You can test which branches will be removed replacing the git push origin --delete with echoI use the following Ruby script to delete my already merged local and remote branches. If I\'m doing it for a repository with multiple remotes and only want to delete from one, I just add a select statement to the remotes list to only get the remotes I want.Using Git version 2.5.0:kuboon\'s answer missed deleting branches which have the word master in the branch name.\nThe following improves on his answer:Of course, it does not delete the "master" branch itself :)git branch --merged | grep -Ev \'^(. master|\\*)\' | xargs -n 1 git branch -d will delete all local branches except the current checked out branch and/or master.Here\'s a helpful article for those looking to understand these commands: Git Clean: Delete Already Merged Branches, by Steven Harman.See GitHub for WindowsThere is no command in Git that will do this for you automatically. But you can write a script that uses Git commands to give you what you need. This could be done in many ways depending on what branching model you are using. If you need to know if a branch has been merged into master the following command will yield no output if myTopicBranch has been merged (i.e. you can delete it)You could use the Git branch command and parse out all branches in Bash and do a for loop over all branches. In this loop you check with above command if you can delete the branch or not.You can use git-del-br tool.You can install it via pip usingP.S: I am the author of the tool. Any suggestions/feedback are welcome. Alias version of Adam\'s updated answer:Also, see this answer for handy tips on escaping complex aliases.Try the following command:git branch -d $(git branch --merged | grep -vw $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD))By using git rev-parse will get the current branch name in order to exclude it. If you got the error, that means there are no local branches to remove.To do the same with remote branches (change origin with your remote name), try:git push origin -vd $(git branch -r --merged | grep -vw $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) | cut -d/ -f2)In case you\'ve multiple remotes, add grep origin | before cut to filter only the origin.If above command fails, try to delete the merged remote-tracking branches first:git branch -rd $(git branch -r --merged | grep -vw $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD))Then git fetch the remote again and use the previous git push -vdcommand again.If you\'re using it often, consider adding as aliases into your ~/.gitconfig file.In case you\'ve removed some branches by mistake, use git reflog to find the lost commits.Based on some of these answers I made my own Bash script to do it too!It uses git branch --merged and git branch -d to delete the branches that have been merged and prompts you for each of the branches before deleting.I use a git-flow esque naming scheme, so this works very safely for me:It basically looks for merged commits that start with either string fix/ or feature/.If you\'d like to delete all local branches that are already merged in to the branch that you are currently on, then I\'ve come up with a safe command to do so, based on earlier answers:This command will not affect your current branch or your master branch. It will also tell you what it\'s doing before it does it, using the -t flag of xargs.To avoid accidentally running the command from any other branch than master I use the following bash script. Otherwise, running git branch --merged | grep -v "\\*" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d from a branch that has been merged of off master could delete the master branch.To delete local branches that have been merged to master branch I\'m using the following alias (git config -e --global):I\'m using git branch -D to avoid error: The branch \'some-branch\' is not fully merged. messages while my current checkout is different from master branch.Windoze-friendly Python script (because git-sweep choked on Wesnoth repository):https://gist.github.com/techtonik/b3f0d4b9a56dbacb3afcIf you are using branching model like HubFlow or GitFlow you can use this command to remove the merged feature branches:git branch --merged | grep feature.* | grep -v "\\*" | xargs -n 1 git branch -dIf you wish to delete local branches that have been merged as well as delete their remotes here\'s the one-liner I prefer:Let\'s say I have a remote named upstream and an origin (GitHub style, my fork is origin, upstream is upstream).I don\'t want to delete ANY masters, HEAD, or anything from the upstream. I also don\'t want to delete the develop branch as that is our common branch we create PRs from.List all remote branches, filtered by ones that were merged:Remove lines from that list that contain words I know are in branch names I don\'t want to remove:Remove the remote name from the reference name (origin/somebranch becomes somebranch):Use xargs to call a one-liner:Pipe it all together you get:This will leave me with only some branches that I have worked on, but have not merged. You can then remove them one by one as there shouldn\'t be too many.Find branches you no longer want:Say you find branch1, branch2, and branch3 you want to delete:My Bash script contribution is based loosely on mmrobin\'s answer.It takes some useful parameters specifying includes and excludes, or to examine/remove only local or remote branches instead of both.Write a script in which Git checks out all the branches that have been merged to master.Then do git checkout master.Finally, delete the merged branches.If they are merged and deleted on origin (github for example), we could update list of branches using command
