I\'ve got a list, and I have a click handler for its items:How can I change the mouse pointer into a hand pointer (like when hovering over a button)? Right now the pointer turns into a text selection pointer when I hover over the list items.Edit: In light of the passage of time, as people have mentioned, you can now safely just use:Original Answer:Actually to expand on the previous answers, different browsers use different names.Will cover you in all cases.You do not require jQuery for this, simply use the following css:And voil\xc3\xa0! Handy.Other valid values (which hand is not) for the current HTML spec can be viewed here.Use for liSee more cursor property with example after running snippet option.useif you want to have a crossbrowser result!CSS:  You can also have the cursor be an image:I think it would be smart to only show the hand/pointer cursor when javascript is available. So people will not have the feeling they can click on something that is not clickable.To achieve that you could use javascript to add the css to the element like soor chain it directly to the click handler.Or when modernizer in combination with <html class="no-js"> is used, the css would look like thisThis thread is getting out of hand, it quickly went from cursors to string instruments. :)Thankfully Google always sends me here when I need a quick reminder, for complete cross browser, use:Just for completeness:also gives a hand, the one you know when moving the view of an image around. Quite useful if you want to emulate grab behavior using jquery and mousedown.for more mouse events check CSS cursor propertyFor being able to make anything get the "mousechange" treatment, you can add a CSS class:I would not say to use cursor:hand since it was only valid for IE 5.5 and below, and IE 6 came with XP (2002).  People will only get the hint to upgrade when their browser stops working for them.  Additionally, in Visual Studio, it will red underline that entry -- it tells me "Validation (CSS 3.0): "hand" is not a valid value for the "cursor" property".All of the other responses suggest using the standard CSS pointer, however, there are two methods:Apply the CSS property cursor:pointer; to the elements. (This is the default style when a cursor hovers over a button.)Apply the CSS property cursor:url(pointer.png); using a custom graphic for your pointer. This may be more desirable if you want to ensure that the user experience is identical on all platforms (instead of allowing the browser/OS decide what your pointer cursor should look like). Note that fallback options may be added in case the image is not found, including secondary urls or any of the other options i.e. cursor:url(pointer.png,fallback.png,pointer);Of course these may be applied to the list items in this manner li{cursor:pointer;}, as a class .class{cursor:pointer;}, or as a value for the style attribute of each element style="cursor:pointer;".for basic hand symbol:\ntryIf you want hand symbol like drag some item and drop it,trySimply just do:I apply on your code to see how it works:Note: Also DO not forget you can have any hand cursor with customised cursor, you can create fav hand icon like this one for example:You can also use following styleSimply Without using CSS or JS Wraping the content around with an anchor tag will do the work....I Hope this works....
