When you hover over a card in Trello and press Ctrl+C, the URL of this card is copied to the clipboard. How do they do this?As far as I can tell, there is no Flash movie involved. I\'ve got Flashblock installed, and the Firefox network tab shows no Flash movie loaded. (That\'s the usual method, for example, by ZeroClipboard.)How do they achieve this magic?(Right at this moment I think I had an epiphany: You cannot select text on the page, so I assume they have an invisible element, where they create a text selection via JavaScript code, and Ctrl+C triggers the browser\'s default behaviour, copying that invisible node\'s text value.)Disclosure: I wrote the code that Trello uses; the code below is the actual source code Trello uses to accomplish the clipboard trick.We don\'t actually "access the user\'s clipboard", instead we help the user out a bit by selecting something useful when they press Ctrl+C.Sounds like you\'ve figured it out; we take advantage of the fact that when you want to hit Ctrl+C, you have to hit the Ctrl key first.  When the Ctrl key is pressed, we pop in a textarea that contains the text we want to end up on the clipboard, and select all the text in it, so the selection is all set when the C key is hit.  (Then we hide the textarea when the Ctrl key comes up)Specifically, Trello does this:In the DOM we\'ve gotCSS for the clipboard stuff:... and the CSS makes it so you can\'t actually see the textarea when it pops in ... but it\'s "visible" enough to copy from.When you hover over a card, it calls... so then the clipboard helper knows what to select when the Ctrl key is pressed.I actually built a Chrome extension that does exactly this, and for all web pages. The source code is on GitHub.I find three bugs with Trello\'s approach, which I know because I\'ve faced them myself :)The copy doesn\'t work in these scenarios:I solved #1 by always having a hidden span, rather than creating one when user hits Ctrl/Cmd.I solved #2 by temporarily clearing the zero-length selection, saving the caret position, doing the copy and restoring the caret position.I haven\'t found a fix for #3 yet :) (For information, check the open issue in my GitHub project).With the help of raincoat\'s (link to GitHub) code, I managed to get a running version accessing the clipboard with plain JavaScript.The only problem is, that this version only works with Chrome. The Trello platform supports all browsers. What I am missing?Sovled thanks to VadimIvanov.See a working example:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/AGEf7/Daniel LeCheminant\'s code didn\'t work for me after converting it from CoffeeScript to JavaScript (js2coffee). It kept bombing out on the _.defer() line.I assumed this was something to do with jQuery deferreds, so I changed it to $.Deferred() and it\'s working now. I tested it in InternetÂ Explorer 11, Firefox 35, and Chrome 39 with jQuery 2.1.1. The usage is the same as described in Daniel\'s post.Something very similar can be seen on http://goo.gl when you shorten the URL.There is a readonly input element that gets programmatically focused, with tooltip "Press CTRL-C to copy". When you hit that shortcut, the input content effectively gets into the clipboard. Really nice :)
