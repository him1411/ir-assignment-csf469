I\'m looking for a good JavaScript equivalent of the C/PHP printf() or for C#/Java programmers, String.Format() (IFormatProvider for .NET).My basic requirement is a thousand separator format for numbers for now, but something that handles lots of combinations (including dates) would be good.I realize Microsoft\'s Ajax library provides a version of String.Format(), but we don\'t want the entire overhead of that framework.Try sprintf() for JavaScript.Update\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ok, if you really want to do a simple format method on your own, don\xe2\x80\x99t do the replacements successively but do them simultaneously.Because most of the other proposals that are mentioned fail when a replace string of previous replacement does also contain a format sequence like this:Normally you would expect the output to be {1}{0} but the actual output is {1}{1}. So do a simultaneously replacement instead like in fearphage\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion.Building on the previously suggested solutions:"{0} is dead, but {1} is alive! {0} {2}".format("ASP", "ASP.NET")outputsASP is dead, but ASP.NET is alive! ASP {2}If you prefer not to modify String\'s prototype:Gives you the much more familiar:String.format(\'{0} is dead, but {1} is alive! {0} {2}\', \'ASP\', \'ASP.NET\');with the same result:ASP is dead, but ASP.NET is alive! ASP {2}It\'s funny because StackÂ Overflow actually has their own formatting function for the String prototype called formatUnicorn. Try it! Go into the console and type something like:You get this output:Hello, Gabriel, are you feeling OK?You can use objects, arrays, and strings as arguments! I got its code and reworked it to produce a new version of String.prototype.format:Note the clever Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) call -- that means if you throw in arguments that are strings or numbers, not a single JSON-style object, you get C#\'s String.Format behavior almost exactly.That\'s because Array\'s slice will force whatever\'s in arguments into an Array, whether it was originally or not, and the key will be the index (0, 1, 2...) of each array element coerced into a string (eg, "0", so "\\\\{0\\\\}" for your first regexp pattern).Neat.I got to this question page hoping to find how to format numbers in JavaScript, without introducing yet another library.  Here\'s what I\'ve found:The equivalent of sprintf("%.2f", num) in JavaScript seems to be num.toFixed(2), which formats num to 2 decimal places, with rounding (but see @ars265\'s comment about Math.round below).The equivalent of sprintf("%.2e", num) is num.toExponential(2).  To print numbers in base B, try num.toString(B).  JavaScript supports automatic conversion to and from bases 2 through 36 (in addition, some browsers have limited support for base64 encoding).Quick tutorial on JS number formattingMozilla reference page for toFixed() (with links to toPrecision(), toExponential(), toLocaleString(), ...)jsxt, ZippoThis option fits better.With this option I can replace strings like these:With your code the second {0} wouldn\'t be replaced. ;)From ES6 on you could use template strings:Be aware that template strings are surrounded by backticks ` instead of (single) quotes.For further information:https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/01/ES6-Template-Stringshttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/template_stringsNote:\nCheck the mozilla-site to find a list of supported browsers.I use this simple function:That\'s very similar to string.format:Here\'s a minimal implementation of sprintf in JavaScript: it only does "%s" and "%d", but I have left space for it to be extended. It is useless to the OP, but other people who stumble across this thread coming from Google might benefit from it.Example:In contrast with similar solutions in previous replies, this one does all substitutions in one go, so it will not replace parts of previously replaced values.For Node.js users there is util.format which has printf-like functionality:JavaScript programmers can use String.prototype.sprintf at https://github.com/ildar-shaimordanov/jsxt/blob/master/js/String.js. Below is example:I\'m surprised no one used reduce, this is a native JavaScript way of doing things, is very concise and powerful.Edit: here is a function that you can insert anywhere to do replace.+1 Zippo with the exception that the function body needs to be as below or otherwise it appends the current string on every iteration:I\'ll add my own discoveries which I\'ve found since I asked:Sadly it seems sprintf doesn\'t handle thousand separator formatting like .NET\'s string format.I use a small library called String.format for JavaScript which supports most of the format string capabilities (including format of numbers and dates), and uses the .NET syntax. The script itself is smaller than 4 kB, so it doesn\'t create much of overhead.Very elegant:Credit goes to (broken link) https://gist.github.com/0i0/1519811I want to share my solution for the \'problem\'. I haven\'t re-invented the wheel but tries to find a solution based on what JavaScript already does. The advantage is, that you get all implicit conversions for free. Setting the prototype property $ of String gives a very nice and compact syntax (see examples below). It is maybe not the most efficient way, but in most cases dealing with output it does not have to be super optimized.Here are a few examples:If you are looking to handle the thousands separator, you should really use toLocaleString() from the JavaScript Number class since it will format the string for the user\'s region.The JavaScript Date class can format localized dates and times.Adding to zippoxer\'s answer, I use this function:I also have a non-prototype version which I use more often for its Java-like syntax:All the cool new stuff in ES 2015 makes this a lot easier:I figured that since this, like the older ones, doesn\'t actually parse the letters, it might as well just use a single token %%. This has the benefit of being obvious and not making it difficult to use a single %. However, if you need %% for some reason, you would need to replace it with itself:The PHPJS project has written JavaScript implementations for many of PHP\'s functions. Since PHP\'s sprintf() function is basically the same as C\'s printf(), their JavaScript implementation of it should satisfy your needs.I use this one:Then I call it:One very slightly different version, the one I prefer (this one uses {xxx} tokens rather than {0} numbered arguments, this is much more self-documenting and suits localization much better):A variation would be:that calls an l() localization function first.There is "sprintf" for JavaScript which you can find at http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript-sprintf.html.I have a solution very close to Peter\'s, but it deals with number and object case.Maybe it could be even better to deal with the all deeps cases, but for my needs this is just fine.PS: This function is very cool if you are using translations in templates frameworks like AngularJS:Where the en.json is something likeFor those who like Node.JS and its util.format feature, I\'ve just extracted it out into its vanilla JavaScript form (with only functions that util.format uses):Harvested from: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/util.jsI have a slightly longer formatter for JavaScript here...  You can do formatting several ways:Also, if you have say a ObjectBase.prototype.format (such as with DateJS) it will use that.Examples...I\'ve also aliased with .asFormat and have some detection in place in case there\'s already a string.format (such as with MS Ajax Toolkit (I hate that library).Just in case someone needs a function to prevent polluting global scope, here is the function that does the same:For basic formatting: I did not see the String.format variant:I didn\'t see pyformat in the list so I thought I\'d throw it in:
