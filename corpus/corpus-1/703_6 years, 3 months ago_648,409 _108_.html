I just installed Node.js and npm (for additional modules).How can I update Node.js and the modules I\'m using to the last versions?Can npm do it? or do I have to remove and reinstall Node.js and npm to get the next versions?I followed https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation (step 3a) and the next npm section.See the docs for the update command:This command will update all the packages listed to the latest version (specified by the tag config). It will also install missing packages.Additionally, see the FAQ:Please note that this command will remove your current version of npm. Make sure to use sudo npm install -g npm if on a Mac.You can also update all outdated local packages by doing npm update without any arguments, or global packages by doing npm update -g.Occasionally, the version of npm will progress such that the current version cannot be properly installed with the version that you have installed already. (Consider, if there is ever a bug in the update command.) In those cases, you can do this:To update Node.js itself, I recommend you use nvm, the Node Version Manager.I found this really neat way of updating node on David Walsh\'s blog, you can do it by installing n:It will install the current stable version of node. However, I recommend using nvm.I understand this question is for Linux machine but just in case anybody is looking for a Windows solution, just go to the Node.js site, click the download button on the homepage and execute the installer program.Thankfully it took care of everything and with a few clicks of \'Next\' button I got the latest 0.8.15 Node.js version running on my Windows 7 machine.As you may know, NPM is currently bundled with Node.js, it means that if you have installed node you already have installed npm. There are several approaches to keep up to date the Node.js and NPM, you need to use one of the following version managers:If yo are on Mac, you can use Homebrew.\nTo install NodeJS and NPM using brew:later you will be able to update it usingNPM will be updated as well.You also will be able to switch to the one of the previous versions if you need, for example:To install brew to your Mac:n is most likely to rvm (Ruby Version Manager), and can be used to manage and update node/npm versions.Install Node.js versions easily:Use (and install if missing) the latest official release:Use/install the stable official release:Switch to the previous version you were using:If you want to see the list of installed nodes, just run n from your command line, the output will be something like the following:The dot (\xe2\x80\xa2) means that it\'s a currently active version. To select a node version from the list use up and down arrows and activate using enter.The n package is written on pure linux shell and available as a npm module (contains package.json), so if you have any Node.js installed, you can install/update the n through the npm:nvm is also like RVM, even the command names and usage are very similar.To download, compile, and install the latest v0.10.x release of the Node.js using nvm:And then you can switch to the installed version:You can create an .nvmrc file containing version number in the project root folder; then run the following command to switch to the specified version:Or you can just run it:If you want to see which versions are already installed, use:To install nvm itself you can use the install script (requires git) using cURL:or wget:P.S.All these approaches I\'ve used on MacOSX and Linux, I don\'t have any experience on how to manage Node.js versions on Windows, I can only suppose that the n (the second one) will work for Microsoft\'s OS (at least from the cygwin).Updating npm is easy:Windows users should read Troubleshooting > Upgrading on Windows in the npm wiki.The link above Troubleshooting#upgrading-on-windows points to a github page npm-windows-upgrade the lines below are quotes from the readme. \nI successfully upgraded from npm 2.7.4 to npm 3.9.3 using node v5.7.0 and powershell (presumably powershell version 5.0.10586.122)First, ensure that you can execute scripts on your system by running \n  the following command from an elevated PowerShell. To run PowerShell\n  as Administrator, click Start, search for PowerShell,  right-click\n  PowerShell and select Run as Administrator.Then, to install and use this upgrader tool, run (also from an\n  elevated  PowerShell or cmd.exe):View curent NPM versionUpdate npm to current versionView all versions including "alpha", "beta" and "rc" (release candidate)Reinstall NPM to specyfic version chosen from the versions list - for example to 5.0.3Installing one version will automaticaly remove the one curently installed.For Linux and iOS prepend commands with sudoTo update node use nvm (or nvmw for windows).To update npm, the npm update npm -g command didn\'t work for me (on windows). What did work was reinstalling npm according to the documentation: "You can download a zip file from https://npmjs.org/dist/, and unpack it in the same folder where node.exe lives." Make sure if you do this that you get rid of your previous installation first (though overwriting it will probably work ok...).To update your modules, use the npm update commandThis is what i get promped on my console from npm when new update/bug-fix are released:Worked for me to update from 1.4.28 to 2.1.5I just installed Node.js on a new Windows 7 machine, with the following results:I then did the above described procedure:and it upgraded to v2.7.3. Except than doing npm -v still gave 2.5.1.I went to the System configuration panel, advanced settings, environment variables. I saw a PATH variable specific to my user account, in addition to the global Path variable.\nThe former pointed to new npm: C:\\Users\\PhiLho\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\nThe latter includes the path to node: C:\\PrgCmdLine\\nodejs\\ (Nowadays, I avoid to install stuff in Program Files and derivates. Avoiding spaces in paths, and noisy useless protections is saner...)\nIf I do which npm.cmd (I have Unix utilities installed...), it points to the one in Node.Anyway, the fix is simple: I just copied the first path (to npm) just before the path to node in the main, global Path variable, and now it picks up the latest version.\n<some stuff before>;C:\\Users\\PhiLho\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm;C:\\PrgCmdLine\\nodejs\\Enjoy. :-)Just listened to an interview with the npm team on the latest episode of nodeup, and they recommended not using update for the update from 1.x to 2.x. Instead, use:\nnpm install npm -g\nSometimes it\'s just simpler to download the latest version from http://nodejs.org/Especially when all other options fail.http://nodejs.org/ -> click INSTALL -> you\'ll have the latest node and npmSimple!I recently stumbled across this article: http://martineau.tv/blog/2013/12/more-efficient-grunt-workflows/ and the author mentions $ npm-check-updates -u && npm install to update all dependencies. This is a little off the topic but I ended up here on a similar search so thought it was worth the share.Just with this codeInstall npm => sudo apt-get install npmInstall n => sudo npm install n -glatest version of node => sudo n latestSpecific version of node you canList available node versions => n lsInstall a specific version => sudo n 4.5.0For Linux, OSX, etc..To install the latest version of NPMnpm install -g npm@latestOr To Install the most recent releasenpm install -g npm@nextAdditional : To check your npm versionnpm -vIf you are in a Windows Machine, I suggest going to the npm websiteFor Cygwin users:Installing n (node version manager) in Cygwin doesn\'t work, instead update node with:Yes, you need to install wget first.

In the later you can choose between the newest version or the bigger version that matches your current package.json\'s rule. For global packages you don\'t have a rule so atualiza will upgrade to newest always.For Windows-User and for updating node i still would recommend nodist> https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodistPersonally I use nvm (Node Version Manager) which is a simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions and you can have multiple versions of node and global modules configured for different users at the same time.You can check at this link: nvmAlso there is a windows version nvm-windowsIf you\'re using Windows: Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/, download latest .exe or .msi file and install to overwrite the old versionsIf you\'re using Ubuntu or Linux: Uninstall node.js first then reinstall, e.g with Ubuntu ():Remove node_modules in your project folder and npm install to make sure your application will run well on new node and npm version.Just run the below scripts on console:This will work for Linux and MAC only
