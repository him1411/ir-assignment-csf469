I have a string 12345.00 would like it to return 12345.0I have looked at trim but looks only to trim whitespace and slice which I don\'t see how this would work. Any suggestions ?You can use the substring function:This is the accepted answer, but as per the conversations below, the slice syntax is much clearer:You can use slice! You just have to make sure you know how to use it. Positive #s are relative to the beginning, negative numbers are relative to the end.You can use the substring method of Javascript string objects:unconditionally removes the last 4 characters from string s.However, if you want to conditionally remove the last 4 characters, only if they are exactly _bar:The easiest method is to use the slice method of the string, which allows negative positions (corresponding to offsets from the end of the string):If you needed something more general to remove everything after (and including) the last underscore, you could do the following (so long as s is guaranteed to contain at least one underscore):For a number like your example, I would recommend doing this over substring:Do note that this will actually round the number, though, which I would imagine is desired but maybe not:Using java-script\'s slice function    This could be use to remove \'_bar\' at end of string,with any length.Regular expression is what you are looking for.How about:try thisUse regex:If you want to do generic rounding of floats, instead of just trimming the last character:EDIT: Seems like there exists a built in function for this, as Paolo points out. That solution is obviously much cleaner than mine. Use parseFloat followed by toFixed https://jsfiddle.net/invos/w3zeqv6v/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34817546/javascript-how-to-delete-last-two-characters-in-a-stringJust use trim if you don\'t want spaces "11.01 \xc2\xb0C".slice(0,-2).trim()try thisyou can also try the live working example on http://jsfiddle.net/informativejavascript/F7WTn/87/In cases where you want to remove something that is close to the end of a string (in case of variable sized strings) you can combine slice() and substr(). I had a string with markup, dynamically built, with a list of anchor tags separated by comma, The string was something like: To remove the last comma I did the following:@Jason S:You can use slice!

So, you can\'t use slice() inside jQuery because slice() is jQuery method for operations with DOM elements, not substrings ... \nIn other words answer @Jon Erickson suggest really perfect solution.However, your method will works out of jQuery function, inside simple Javascript.\nNeed to say due to last discussion in comments, that jQuery is very much more often renewable extension of JS than his own parent most known ECMAScript.Here also exist two methods:as our:string.substring(from,to) as plus if \'to\' index nulled returns the rest of string. so:\nstring.substring(from) positive or negative ...and some other - substr() - which provide range of substring and \'length\' can be positive only:\nstring.substr(start,length)Also some maintainers suggest that last method string.substr(start,length) do not works or work with error for MSIE.use subString to get everything to the left of _bar.  But first you have to get the instr of _bar in the string.3 is that start and 7 is the length
