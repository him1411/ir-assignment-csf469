If I have a JavaScript object, sayis there a built-in or accepted best practice way to get the length of this object?The most robust answer (i.e. that captures the intent of what you\'re trying to do while causing the fewest bugs) would be:There\'s a sort of convention in JavaScript that you don\'t add things to Object.prototype, because it can break enumerations in various libraries. Adding methods to Object is usually safe, though.Here\'s an update as of 2016 and widespread deployment of ES5 and beyond.  For IE9+ and all other modern ES5+ capable browsers, you can use Object.keys() so the above code just becomes:This doesn\'t have to modify any existing prototype since Object.keys() is now built in.If you know you don\'t have to worry about hasOwnProperty checks, you can do this very simply:Updated: If you\'re using Underscore.js (recommended, it\'s lightweight!), then you can just doIf not, and you don\'t want to mess around with Object properties for whatever reason, and are already using jQuery, a plugin is equally accessible:Use something as simple as:It doesn\'t have to be difficult and definitely doesn\'t require another function to accomplish.Here\'s the most cross-browser solution.This is better than the accepted answer because it uses native Object.keys if exists.\nThus, it is the fastest for all modern browsers.I\'m not a JavaScript expert, but it looks like you would have to loop through the elements and count them since Object doesn\'t have a length method:@palmsey: In fairness to the OP, the JavaScript documentation actually explicitly refer to using variables of type Object in this manner as "associative arrays".This method gets all your object\'s property names in an array, so you can get the length of that array which is equal to your object\'s keys\' length.To not mess with the prototype or other code, you could build and extend your own object:If you always use the add method, the length property will be correct. If you\'re worried that you or others forget about using it, you could add the property counter which the others have posted to the length method, too.Of course, you could always overwrite the methods. But even if you do, your code would probably fail noticeably, making it easy to debug. ;)Here\'s how and don\'t forget to check that the property is not on the prototype chain:Here is a completely different solution that will only work in more modern browsers (IE9+, Chrome, Firefox 4+, Opera 11.60+, Safari 5.1+)See jsFiddleSetup your Associative Array classNow you can use this code as follows...For some cases it is better to just store the size in a separate variable. Especially, if you\'re adding to the array by one element in one place and can easily increment the size. It would obviously work much faster if you need to check the size often.Use:@palmsey: In fairness to the OP, the javascript docs actually explicitly refer to using variables of type Object in this manner as "associative arrays".And in fairness to @palmsey he was quite correct, they aren\'t associative arrays, they\'re definitely objects :) - doing the job of an associative array. But as regards the wider point you definitely seem to have the right of it according to this rather fine article I found: JavaScript \xe2\x80\x9cAssociative Arrays\xe2\x80\x9d Considered HarmfulBut according to all this, isn\'t the accepted answer itself bad practice?Specify a prototype size() function for ObjectIf anything else has been added to Object .prototype, then the suggested code will fail:I don\'t think that answer should be the accepted one as it can\'t be trusted to work if you have any other code running in the same execution context. To do it in a robust fashion surely you would need to define the size method within myArray and check for the type of the members as you iterate through them.If we have the hash hash =  {"a" : "b", "c": "d"};we can get the length using the length of the keys which is the length of the hash:keys(hash).lengthWhat about something like this --If you are using AngularJS 1.x you can do things the AngularJS way by creating a filter and using the code from any of the other examples such as the following:UsageIn your controller:Or in your view:A variation on some of the above is:It is a bit more elegant way to integrate hasOwnProp.If you need an associative data structure that exposes its size, better use a map instead of an object.If you don\'t care about supporting Internet Explorer 8 or lower, you can easily get the number of properties in an object by applying the following two steps:If you need to do this more than once, you could wrap this logic in a function:How to use this particular function:See also this Fiddle for a demo.Here\'s a different version of James Cogan\'s answer. Instead of passing an argument, just prototype out the Object class and make the code cleaner.jsfiddle example: http://jsfiddle.net/qar4j/1/You can always do Object.keys(myObject).length to get the same result as [].length would give for normal array.You can simply use Object.keys(obj).length on any object to get its length. Object.keys returns an array containing all of the object keys (properties) which can come in handy for finding the length of that object using the length of the corresponding array. You can even write a function for this. Let\'s get creative and write a method for it as well (along with a more convienient getter property):Below is a version of James Coglan\'s answer in CoffeeScript for those who have abandoned straight JavaScript :)Like most JavaScript problems, there are many solutions.  You could extend the Object that for better or worse works like many other languages\' Dictionary (+ first class citizens). Nothing wrong with that, but another option is to construct a new Object that meets your specific needs. Simple solution:The solution work for many cases and cross browser:CodeData Examples:UsageWe can find the length of Object by using :A bit late to the game, but a nice way to achieve this (IE9+ only) is to define a magic getter on the length property:And you can just use it like so:Would give 1.If you are using jQuery, just go with the object\'s .length method.$(object).length will give you the length of the passed object.UPDATE : This will always return 1 in case of object But works well with jQuery element.
