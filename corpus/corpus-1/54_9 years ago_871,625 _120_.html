I have a master and a development branch, both pushed to GitHub. I\'ve cloned, pulled, and fetched, but I remain unable to get anything other than the master branch back.I\'m sure I\'m missing something obvious, but I have read the manual and I\'m getting no joy at all.First, clone a remote Git repository and cd into it:Next, look at the local branches in your repository:But there are other branches hiding in your repository! You can see these using the -a flag:If you just want to take a quick peek at an upstream branch, you can check it out directly:But if you want to work on that branch, you\'ll need to create a local tracking branch which is done automatically by:and you will seeThat last line throws some people: "New branch" - huh?\nWhat it really means is that the branch is taken from the index and created locally for you.  The previous line is actually more informative as it tells you that the branch is being set up to track the remote branch, which usually means the origin/branch_name branch Now, if you look at your local branches, this is what you\'ll see:You can actually track more than one remote repository using git remote.At this point, things are getting pretty crazy, so run gitk to see what\'s going on:If you have many remote branches that you want to fetch at once, do:Now you can checkout any branch as you need to, without hitting the remote repository.This Bash script helped me out:It will create tracking branches for all remote branches, except master (which you probably got from the original clone command). I think you might still need to do a to be sure.One liner: git branch -a | grep -v HEAD | perl -ne \'chomp($_); s|^\\*?\\s*||; if (m|(.+)/(.+)| && not $d{$2}) {print qq(git branch --track $2 $1/$2\\n)} else {$d{$_}=1}\' | csh -xfs As usual: test in your setup before copying rm -rf universe as we know it Credits for one-liner go to user cfiUsing the --mirror option seems to copy the remote tracking branches properly.\nHowever, it sets up the repository as a bare repository, so you have to turn it back into a normal repository afterwards.Reference: Git FAQ: How do I clone a repository with all remotely tracked branches? You can easily switch to a branch without using the fancy "git checkout -b somebranch origin/somebranch" syntax.  You can just do:Git will automatically do the right thing:Git will check whether a branch with the same name exists in exactly one remote, and if it does, it tracks it the same way as if you had explicitly specified that it\'s a remote branch. From the git-checkout man page of Git 1.8.2.1:If <branch> is not found but there does exist a tracking branch in\n  exactly one remote (call it <remote>) with a matching name, treat as\n  equivalent toRegarding,$ git checkout -b experimental origin/experimentalusingor the more verbose but easier to remembermight be better, in terms of tracking a remote repository. The fetch that you are doing should get all the remote branches, but it won\'t create local branches for them. If you use gitk, you should see the remote branches described as "remotes/origin/dev" or something similar.To create a local branch based on a remote branch, do something like:Which should return something like:Now, when you are on the dev branch, "git pull" will update your local dev to the same point as the remote dev branch.  Note that it will fetch all branches, but only pull the one you are on to the top of the tree.When you do "git clone git://location", all branches and tags are fetched.In order to work on top of a specific remote branch, assuming it\'s the origin remote:Use aliases. Though there aren\'t any native Git one-liners, you can define your own asand then use it asThis isn\'t too much complicated, very simple and straight forward steps are as follows;git fetch origin This will bring all the remote branches to your local.git branch -a This will show you all the remote branches.git checkout --track origin/<branch you want to checkout>Verify whether you are in the desired branch by the following command;The output will like this;Notice the * sign that denotes the current branch.git clone downloads all remote remote branches but still considers them "remote", even though the files are located in your new repository. There\'s one exception to this, which is that the cloning process creates a local branch called "master" from the remote branch called "master". By default, git branch only shows local branches, which is why you only see "master".git branch -a shows all branches, including remote branches.If you actually want to work on a branch, you\'ll probably want a "local" version of it. To simply create local branches from remote branches (without checking them out and thereby changing the contents of your working directory), you can do that like this:In this example, branchone is the name of a local branch you\'re creating based on origin/branchone; if you instead want to create local branches with different names, you can do this:Once you\'ve created a local branch, you can see it with git branch (remember, you don\'t need -a to see local branches).Just do this:You see, \'git clone git://example.com/myprojectt\' fetches everything, even the branches, you just have to checkout them, then your local branch will be created.Better late than never, but here is the best way to do this:At this point you have a complete copy of the remote repo with all of it\'s branches (verify with git branch).  You can use --mirror instead of --bare if your remote repo has remotes of its own.You only need to use "git clone" to get all branches.Even though you only see master branch, you can use "git branch -a" to see all branches.And you can switch to any branch which you already have.Don\'t worry that after you "git clone", you don\'t need to connect with the remote repo, "git branch -a" and "git checkout " can be run successfully when you close your wifi. So it is proved that when you do "git clone", it already has copied all branches from the remote repo. After that, you don\'t need the remote repo, your local already has all branches\' codes.  Use my tool git_remote_branch (you need Ruby installed on your machine). It\'s built specifically to make remote branch manipulations dead easy.Each time it does an operation on your behalf, it prints it in red at the console. Over time, they finally stick into your brain :-)If you don\'t want grb to run commands on your behalf, just use the \'explain\' feature. The commands will be printed to your console instead of executed for you.Finally, all commands have aliases, to make memorization easier.Note that this is alpha software ;-)Here\'s the help when you run grb help:A git clone is supposed to copy the entire repository.  Try cloning it, and then run git branch with no additional arguments.  It should list all the branches.  If then you want to switch to branch "foo" instead of "master", use git checkout foo.Looking at one of answers to the question I noticed that it\'s possible to shorten it:But beware, if one of remote branches is named as e.g. admin_master  it won\'t get downloaded!Thanks to bigfish for original ideaI needed to do exactly the same. Here is my Ruby script.For copy-paste into command line:For more readibility:Based on answer of VonC.all the answers I saw here are valid but there is a much cleaner way to clone a repository and to pull all the branches at once. When you clone a repository all the information of the branches is actually downloaded but the branches are hidden. With the commandyou can show all the branches of the repository, and with the commandyou can then "download" them manually one at a time. However, when you want to clone a repo with a lot of branches all the ways illustrated are above are lengthy and tedious in respect to a much cleaner and quicker way that I am going to show, though it\'s a bit complicated. You need three steps to accomplish this:create a new empty folder on your machine and clone a mirror copy of the .git folder from the repository:the local repository inside the folder my_repo_folder is still empty, there is just a hidden .git folder now that you can see with a "ls -alt" command from the terminal.switch this repository from an empty (bare) repository to a regular repository by switching the boolean value "bare" of the git configurations to false:Grab everything that inside the current folder and create all the branches on the local machine, therefore making this a normal repo. So now you can just type the command "git branch" and you can see that all the branches are downloaded. This is the quick way in which you can clone a git repository with all the branches at once, but it\'s not something you wanna do for every single project in this way. Git usually (when not specified) fetches all branches and/or tags (refs, see: git ls-refs) from one or more other repositories along with the objects necessary to complete their histories. In other words it fetches the objects which are reachable by the objects that are already downloaded. See: What does git fetch really do?Sometimes you may have branches/tags which aren\'t directly connected to the current one, so git pull --all/git fetch --all won\'t help in that case, but you can list them by:and fetch them manually by knowing the ref names.So to fetch them all, try:The --depth=10000 parameter may help if you\'ve shallowed repository.Then check all your branches again:If above won\'t help, you need to add missing branches manually to the tracked list (as they got lost somehow):by git remote set-branches like:so it may appear under remotes/origin after fetch:If you still cannot get anything other than the master branch, check the followings:These code will pull all remote branches code to local repo.Cloning from a local repo will not work with git clone & git fetch: a lot of branches/tags will remain unfetched.To get a clone with all branches and tags.To get a clone with all branches and tags but also with a working copy:None of these answers cut it, except user nobody is on the right track.I was having trouble with moving a repo from one server/system to another. When I cloned the repo, it only created a local branch for master so when I pushed to the new remote, only master branch was pushed.So I found these two methods VERY useful. Hope they help someone else.Method 1:Method 2:Here is another short one-liner command which\ncreates local branches for all remote branches:It works also properly if tracking local branches are already created.\nYou can call it after the first git clone or any time later.If you do not need to have master branch checked out after cloning, use I\'m using Bitbucket, a Repository Hosting Service of Atlassian. So I try to follow their docs. And that works perfectly for me. With the following easy and short commands you can checkout your remote branch.At first clone your repository, then change into the destination folder. And last but not least fetch and checkout:That\'s it. Here a litte more real world example:You will find detail information about the commands in the docs:\nClone Command, Fetch Command, Checkout CommandI wrote this small Powershell functions to be able to checkout all my git branches, that are on origin remote.More git functions can be found on my git settings repoAs of early 2017, the answer in this comment works:git fetch <origin-name> <branch-name> brings the branch down for you. While this doesn\'t pull all branches at once, you can singularly execute this per-branch.I\'m going to add my 2 cents here because I got here trying to find out how to pull down a remote branch I had deleted locally. Origin was not mine, and I didn\'t want to go through the hassle of re-cloning everything This worked for me:assuming you need to recreate the branch locally:So if I forked from gituser/master to sjp and then branched it to sjp/mynewbranch it would look like this:A little late to the party, but I think this does the trick:If this does something undesirable, I\'d love to know. However, so far, this works for me.
