How can I display JSON in an easy-to-read (for human readers) format? I\'m looking primarily for indentation and whitespace, with perhaps even colors / font-styles / etc.Pretty-printing is implemented natively in JSON.stringify(). The third argument enables pretty printing and sets the spacing to use:If you need syntax highlighting, you might use some regex magic like so:See in action here: jsfiddleOr a full snippet provided below:User Pumbaa80\'s answer is great if you have an object you want pretty printed. If you\'re starting from a valid JSON string that you want to pretty printed, you need to convert it to an object first:This builds a JSON object from the string, and then converts it back to a string using JSON stringify\'s pretty print.I use the JSONView Chrome extension (it is as pretty as it gets :):Edit: added jsonreport.jsI\'ve also released an online stand-alone JSON pretty print viewer, jsonreport.js, that provides a human readable HTML5 report you can use to view any JSON data.You can read more about the format in New JavaScript HTML5 Report Format.Based on Pumbaa80\'s answer I have modified the code to use the console.log colours (working on Chrome for sure) and not HTML. Output can be seen inside console. You can edit the _variables inside the function adding some more styling.Here is a bookmarklet you can use:Usage:Edit: I just tried to escape the % symbol with this line, after the variables declaration:But I find out that Chrome is not supporting % escaping in the console. Strange... Maybe this will work in the future.Cheers!You can use console.dir(), which is a shortcut for console.log(util.inspect()).\n(The only difference is that it bypasses any custom inspect() function defined on an object.)It uses syntax-highlighting, smart indentation, removes quotes from keys and just makes the output as pretty as it gets.and for the command line:cat package.json | node -e "process.stdin.pipe(new stream.Writable({write: chunk => console.dir(JSON.parse(chunk), {depth: null, colors: true})}))"For debugging purpose I use:// in case of displaying in HTML, you should to add a balise < pre>< /pre>Unsatisfied with other pretty printers for Ruby, I wrote my own (NeatJSON) and then ported it to JavaScript including a free online formatter. The code is free under MIT license (quite permissive).Features (all optional):I\'ll copy the source code here so that this is not just a link to a library, but I encourage you to go to the GitHub project page, as that will be kept up-to-date and the code below will not.Douglas Crockford\'s JSON in JavaScript library will pretty print JSON via the stringify method.You may also find the answers to this older question useful: How can I pretty-print JSON in (unix) shell script?Thanks a lot @all!\nBased on the previous answers, here is another variant method providing custom replacement rules as parameter:I ran into an issue today with @Pumbaa80\'s code. I\'m trying to apply JSON syntax highlighting to data that I\'m rendering in a Mithril view, so I need to create DOM nodes for everything in the JSON.stringify output.I split the really long regex into its component parts as well.Code in context on Github hereIt works well: Read more here: https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/Console/tableI recommend using HighlightJS. It uses the same principle as the accepted answer, but works also for many other languages, and has many pre-defined colour schemes. If using RequireJS, you can generate a compatible module withGeneration relies on Python3 and Java. Add -n to generate a non-minified version.This is nice:https://github.com/mafintosh/json-markup from mafintoshHTMLExample stylesheet can be found hereIf you need this to work in a textarea the accepted solution will not work.<textarea id=\'textarea\'></textarea>$("#textarea").append(formatJSON(JSON.stringify(jsonobject),true)); If you use net.sf.json, you can pretty print as follows (using a 4 space indentation):Use  Newtonsoft.Json  dll. this is work fine in IE and Chrome put this code in your razor view
