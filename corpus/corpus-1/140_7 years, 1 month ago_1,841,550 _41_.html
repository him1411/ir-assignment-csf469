I\'m looking for a string.contains or string.indexof method in Python.I want to do:You can use the in operator:If it\'s just a substring search you can use string.find("substring").You do have to be a little careful with find, index, and in though, as they are substring searches. In other words, this:It would print Found \'is\' in the string. Similarly, if "is" in s: would evaluate to True. This may or may not be what you want.if needle in haystack: is the normal use, as @Michael says -- it relies on the in operator, more readable and faster than a method call.If you truly need a method instead of an operator (e.g. to do some weird key= for a very peculiar sort...?), that would be \'haystack\'.__contains__.  But since your example is for use in an if, I guess you don\'t really mean what you say;-).  It\'s not good form (nor readable, nor efficient) to use special methods directly -- they\'re meant to be used, instead, through the operators and builtins that delegate to them.Basically, you want to find a substring in a string in python. There are two ways to search for a substring in a string in Python.Method 1: in operatorYou can use the Python\'s in operator to check for a substring. It\'s quite simple and intuitive. It will return True if the substring was found in the string else False.Method 2: str.find() methodThe second method is to use the str.find() method. Here, we call the .find() method on the string in which substring is to found. We pass the substring to the find() method and check its return value. If its value is other than -1, the substring was found in the string, otherwise not. The value returned is the index where substring was found.I would recommend you to use the first method as it is more Pythonic and intuitive.No, there isn\'t any string.contains(str) method, but there is the in operator:Here is a more complex working example:Yes, but Python has a comparison operator that you should use instead, because the language intends its usage, and other programmers will expect you to use it. That keyword is in, which is used as a comparison operator:The opposite (complement), which the original question asks for, is not in:This is semantically the same as not \'foo\' in \'**foo**\' but it\'s much more readable and explicitly provided for in the language as a readability improvement.As promised, here\'s the contains method:returns True. You could also call this function from the instance of the superstring:But don\'t. Methods that start with underscores are considered semantically private. The only reason to use this is when extending the in and not in functionality (e.g. if subclassing str): and now:Also, avoid the following string methods:Other languages may have no methods to directly test for substrings, and so you would have to use these types of methods, but with Python, it is more efficient to use the in comparison operator:And now we see that using in -is much faster than the below:Here are a few useful examples that speak for themselves concerning the in method:Caveat. Lists are iterables, and the in method acts on iterables, not just strings.So apparently there is nothing similar for vector-wise comparison. An obvious Python way to do so would be:Another way to find whether a string contains a few characters or not with the Boolean return value (i.e. True or `False):In Python there are two simple ways you can achieve this:The Pythonic way: Using Python\'s \'in\' Keyword-in takes two "arguments", one on the left(substring) and one on the right, and returns True if the left argument is contained within the rightside argument and if not,it returns False.Output:The non-Pythonic way: Using Python\'s str.find:The find method returns the position of the string within the string or -1 if it\'s not found. But simply check if the position is not -1.Output:Here is your answer:For checking if it is false:OR:
