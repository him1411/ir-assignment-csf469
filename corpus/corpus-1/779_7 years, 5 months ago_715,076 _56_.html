Given an item, how can I count its occurrences in a list in Python?If you are using Python 2.7 or 3 and you want number of occurrences for each element:Counting the occurrences of one item in a listFor counting the occurrences of just one list item you can use count()Counting the occurrences of all items in a list is also known as "tallying" a list, or creating a tally counter.Counting all items with count()To count the occurrences of items in l one can simply use a list comprehension and the count() method(or similarly with a dictionary dict((x,l.count(x)) for x in set(l)))Example: Counting all items with Counter()Alternatively, there\'s the faster Counter class from the collections libraryExample:How much faster is Counter?I checked how much faster Counter is for tallying lists. I tried both methods out with a few values of n and it appears that Counter is faster by a constant factor of approximately 2.Here is the script I used:And the output:Another way to get the number of occurrences of each item, in a dictionary:list.count(x) returns the number of times x appears in a listsee:\nhttp://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-listsIf you want to count all values at once you can do it very fast using numpy arrays and bincount as followswhich givesHere\'s an example list:There\'s the list.count methodThis works fine for any list. Tuples have this method as well:And then there\'s collections.Counter. You can dump any iterable into a Counter, not just a list, and the Counter will retain a data structure of the counts of the elements.Usage:Counters are based on Python dictionaries, their keys are the elements, so the keys need to be hashable. They are basically like sets that allow redundant elements into them.You can add or subtract with iterables from your counter:And you can do multi-set operations with the counter as well:Another answer suggests:Why not use pandas? Pandas is a common library, but it\'s not in the standard library. Adding it as a dependency is non-trivial.There are builtin solutions for this use-case in the list object itself as well as in the standard library.If your project does not already require pandas, it would be foolish to make it a requirement just for this functionality.I had this problem today and rolled my own solution before I thought to check SO.  This:is really, really slow for large lists.  My solutionis actually a bit faster than the Counter solution, at least for Python 2.7.Why not using Pandas?Output:If you are looking for a count of a particular element, say a, try:Output:To count the number of diverse elements having a common type:gives3  , not 6Output list:You can also use countOf method of a built-in module operator.I\'ve compared all suggested solutions (and a few new ones) with perfplot (a small project of mine).For large enough arrays, it turns out thatis slightly faster than the other solutions.As established before,is what you want.Code to reproduce the plots:2.This will return the amount of occurences of your_value
