I\'m using virtualenv and the virtualenvwrapper. I can switch between virtualenv\'s just fine using the workon command. However, how do I exit all virtual machines and workon my real machine again? Right now, the only way I have of getting back tois to exit the shell and start a new one. That\'s kind of annoying. Is there a command to workon "nothing", and if so, what is it? If such a command does not exist, how would I go about creating it?Usually, activating a virtualenv gives you a shell function named:which puts things back to normal.I have just looked specifically again at the code for virtualenvwrapper, and, yes, it too supports deactivate as the way to escape from all virtualenvs.If you are trying to leave an Anaconda environment, the procedure is a bit different: run the two-word command source deactivate since they implement deactivation using a stand-alone script.I defined an alias workoff as the opposite of workon:Easy to remember:to activate python virtual environment:to deactivate:If this doesn\'t work , try Anyone who knows how bash source works will think that\'s odd, but some wrappers/workflows around virtualenv implement as a compliment/counterpart to source activate. YMMVYou can use virtualenvwrapper in order to ease the way you work with virtualenvInstalling virtualenvwrapperIf you are using standard shell, open your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc if you use oh-my-zsh. Add this two lines:To activate an existing virtualenv, use command workon:In order to deactivate your virtualenv:Here is my tutorial, step by step in how to install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapperI use zsh-autoenv which is based off autoenv. zsh-autoenv automatically\n  sources (known/whitelisted) .autoenv.zsh files, typically used in\n  project root directories. It handles "enter" and leave" events,\n  nesting, and stashing of variables (overwriting and restoring).Here is an example:So when I leave the dtree directory, the virtual environment is automatically exited.(my_env) basant@basant:~/EonTraining/my_env$ deactivateuse \'deactivate\'basant@basant-Lenovo-E40-80:~/EonTraining/my_env$ Gone (my_env);Had the same problem myself while working on an installer script, I took a look at what the bin/activate_this.py did and reversed it. Example:Not 100% sure if it works as intended, I may have missed something completely.
