When I teach introductory computer science courses, I like to lighten the mood with some humor. Having a sense of fun about the material makes it less frustrating and more memorable, and it\'s even motivating if the joke requires some technical understanding to \'get it\'!I\'ll start off with a couple of my favorites:Q: How do you tell an introverted computer scientist from an extroverted computer scientist?A: An extroverted computer scientist looks at your shoes when he talks to you.And the classic:Q: Why do programmers always mix up Halloween and Christmas?A: Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!I\'m always looking for more of these, and I can\'t think of a better group of people to ask. What are your best programmer/computer science/programming jokes?A man flying in a hot air balloon suddenly realizes he\xe2\x80\x99s lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts to get directions, "Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?" The man below says: "Yes. You\'re in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field.""You must work in Information Technology," says the balloonist."I do" replies the man. "How did you know?""Well," says the balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically correct, but It\'s of no use to anyone."The man below replies, "You must work in management.""I do," replies the balloonist, *"But how\'d you know?"**"Well", says the man, "you don\xe2\x80\x99t know where you are or where you\xe2\x80\x99re going, but you expect me to be able to help. You\xe2\x80\x99re in the same position you were before we met, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s my fault."\xe2\x80\x9cKnock, knock.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9dvery long pause\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9cJava.\xe2\x80\x9d :-oA SQL query goes into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, "Can I join you?"Q: how many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?A: none, that\'s a hardware problemA young Programmer and his Project Manager board a train headed through\nthe mountains on its way to Wichita. They can find no place to sit\nexcept for two seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her\ngrandmother. After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the\nyoung programmer are interested in each other, because they are giving each other looks. Soon the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a sound of a kiss followed by the sound of a slap.When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without saying a word. The grandmother is thinking to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very brash for that young man to kiss my granddaughter, but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad she slapped him.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Project manager is sitting there thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the young tech was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t missed him when she slapped me!\xe2\x80\x9dThe young woman was sitting and thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad the guy kissed me, but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!\xe2\x80\x9dThe young programmer sat there with a satisfied smile on his face. He thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cLife is good. How often does a guy have the chance to kiss a beautiful girl and slap his Project manager all at the same time!\xe2\x80\x9dIf you\'re happy and you know it, syntax error!A physicist, an engineer and a programmer were in a car driving over a steep alpine pass when the brakes failed. The car was getting faster and faster, they were struggling to get round the corners and once or twice only the feeble crash barrier saved them from crashing down the side of the mountain. They were sure they were all going to die, when suddenly they spotted an escape lane. They pulled into the escape lane, and came safely to a halt.The physicist said "We need to model the friction in the brake pads and the resultant temperature rise, see if we can work out why they failed".The engineer said "I think I\'ve got a few spanners in the back. I\'ll take a look and see if I can work out what\'s wrong".The programmer said "Why don\'t we get going again and see if it\'s reproducible?"When your hammer is C++, everything begins to look like a thumb.A computer science student is studying under a tree and another pulls up on a flashy new bike.  The first student asks, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99d you get that?\xe2\x80\x9dThe student on the bike replies, \xe2\x80\x9cWhile I was studying outside, a beautiful girl pulled up on her bike.  She took off all her clothes and said, \xe2\x80\x98You can have anything you want\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9dThe first student responds, \xe2\x80\x9cGood choice!  Her clothes probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have fit you.\xe2\x80\x9d If you put a million monkeys at a million keyboards, one of them will eventually write a Java program.The rest of them will write Perl programs.Q: "Whats the object-oriented way to become wealthy?"A: Inheritance["hip","hip"](hip hip array!)A Cobol programmer made so much money doing Y2K remediation that he was able to have himself cryogenically frozen when he died.  One day in the future, he was unexpectedly resurrected.When he asked why he was unfrozen, he was told:"It\'s the year 9999 - and you know Cobol"Programming is like sex:One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. Q: How many prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?A: Yes.To understand what recursion is, you must first understand recursion.A guy is standing on the corner of the street smoking one cigarette after another. A lady walking by notices him and says\n"Hey, don\'t you know that those things can kill you? I mean, didn\'t you see the giant warning on the box?!"\n"That\'s OK" says the guy, puffing casually "I\'m a computer programmer"\n"So? What\'s that got to do with anything?"\n"We don\'t care about warnings. We only care about errors."so this programmer goes out on a date with a hot chickThe fantastic element that explains the appeal of games to many developers is neither the fire-breathing monsters nor the milky-skinned, semi-clad sirens; it is the experience of carrying out a task from start to finish without any change in the user requirements. In the 1960\'s the KGB was very interested in learning everything possible about the American space program, sending all sorts of spies to find every possible piece of information.One afternoon, a breathless spy returned to headquarters with a page of paper in his hand, excitedly shouting to his superior, "Comrade! Comrade! The Americans are using Lisp to write their rocket launching software!"The commander was skeptical. "How do you know?""I broke into their research lab and stole a page from the teletype machine! It\'s not the whole program, but it\'s the final page and contains the concluding logic of the program! See for yourself!!!!"The commander looked at the page and smiled:A Geologist and an engineer are sitting next to each other on a long flight from LA to NY. The Geologist leans over to the Engineer and asks if he would like to play a fun game. The Engineer just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. \nThe Geologist persists and explains that the game is real easy and a lotta fun. He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don\'t know the answer, you pay me $5. Then you ask me a question, and if I don\'t know the answer, I\'ll pay you $5." Again, the Engineer politely declines and tries to get to sleep. The Geologist now somewhat agitated, says, "OK, if you don\'t know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don\'t know the answer, I\'ll pay you $50!" This catches the Engineer\'s attention, and he sees no end to this torment unless he plays, so he agrees to the game. The Geologist asks the first question. "What\'s the distance from the Earth to the moon?" The Engineer doesn\'t say a word, but reaches into his wallet, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the Geologist. Now, it\'s the Engineer\'s turn. He asks the Geologist, "What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down on four?" The Geologist looks up at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all of his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends e-mail to his co-workers -- all to no avail. After about an hour, he wakes the Engineer and hands him $50. The Engineer politely takes the $50 and turns away to try to get back to sleep. The Geologist is more than a little miffed, shakes the Engineer and asks, "Well, so what\'s the answer?" Without a word, the Engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the Geologist $5, and turns away to get back to sleep.Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better programmer. This goes on for a few hours until they come to an agreement to hold a contest with God as the judge. They set themselves before their computers and begin. They type furiously, lines of code streaming up the screen, for several hours straight.Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning strikes, taking out the electricity. Moments later, the power is restored, and God announces that the contest is over. He asks Satan to show his work. Visibly upset, Satan cries and says, \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing. I lost it all when the power went out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d says God, \xe2\x80\x9clet us see if Jesus has fared any better.\xe2\x80\x9dJesus presses a key, and the screen comes to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers.Satan is astonished. He stutters, \xe2\x80\x9cB-b-but how?! I lost everything, yet Jesus\xe2\x80\x99 program is intact! How did he do it?\xe2\x80\x9dGod chuckles, \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody knows\xe2\x80\xa6 Jesus saves.\xe2\x80\x9dThis entry is the Obfuscated C Contest for 1990, is a true classic.  Ignoring that fact that it\'s a C program that actually compiles & runs, the source code is in the form of a hilarious conversation between a man & a woman.There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who have regular sex.Here\'s one I came up with many, many, many years ago:I called the janitor the other day to see what he could do about my dingy\nlinoleum floor.  He said he would have been happy to loan me a polisher, but\nthat he hadn\'t the slightest idea what he had done with it.  I told him not to\nworry about it - that as a programmer it wasn\'t the first time I had\nexperienced a buffer allocation failure due to a memory error.Why programmers like UNIX:unzip, strip, touch, finger, grep, mount, fsck, more, yes, fsck, fsck, fsck, umount, sleepThese two strings walk into a bar and sit down.
