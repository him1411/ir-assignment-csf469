I accidentally amended my previous commit. The commit should have been separate to keep history of the changes I made to a particular file.Is there a way to undo that last commit? If I do something like git reset --hard HEAD^, the first commit also is undone.(I have not yet pushed to any remote directories)What you need to do is to create a new commit with the same details as the current HEAD commit, but with the parent as the previous version of HEAD. git reset --soft will move the branch pointer so that the next commit happens on top of a different commit from where the current branch head is now.use the ref-log:you should then have all your previously amended changes only in your working copy and can commit againto see a full list of previous indices type git reflogYou can always split a commit,\nFrom the manualFind your amended commits by:Note: You may add --patch to see the body of the commits for clarity. Same as git reflog.then reset your HEAD to any previous commit at the point it was fine by:Note: Replace SHA1 with your real commit hash. Also note that this command will lose any uncommitted changes, so you may stash them before.Then cherry-pick the other commit that you need on top of it:Maybe can use git reflog to get two commit before amend and after amend.Then use git diff before_commit_id after_commit_id > d.diff to get diff between before amend and after amend.Next use git checkout before_commit_id to back to before commitAnd last use git apply d.diff to apply the real change you did.That solves my problem. Possibly worth noting that if you\'re still in your editor with the commit message, you can delete the commit message and it will abort the git commit --amend command.Checkout to temporary branch with last commitgit branch temp HEAD@{1}Reset last commit git reset tempNow, you\'ll have all files your commit as well as previous commit.
