This question already has an answer here:I have a shopping cart that displays product options in a dropdown menu, and I want to make some other fields on the page only visible if they select "Yes" in the previous option.  The problem is that the shopping cart also includes the price modifier in the text, and that can be different for each product.  So if I do this it works:However I would rather use something like this:Which doesn\'t work.  I only want to perform the action if the selected option contains the word "Yes", and would ignore the price modifier.I appreciate any help.Like this:...or you can use the tilde operator:This works because indexOf() returns -1 if the string wasn\'t found at all.Note that this is case-sensitive.\nIf you want a case-insensitive search, you can write Or,You could use search or match for this.str.search( \'Yes\' )will return the position of the match, or -1 if it isn\'t found.Another way:** Tested on Firefox, Safari 6 and Chrome 36 **It\'s pretty late to write this answer, but I thought of including it anyhow. String.prototype now has a method includes which can check for substring. This method is case sensitive.To check for a substring, the following approach can be taken:Check out the documentation to know more.You can use this Polyfill in ie and chromeECMAScript 6 introduces String.prototype.includes, previously named contains.It can be used like this:It also accepts an optional second argument which specifies the position at which to begin searching:It can be polyfilled to make it work on old browsers.Returns number of times the keyword is included in the string.I know that best way is str.indexOf(s) !== -1; http://hayageek.com/javascript-string-contains/I suggest another way(str.replace(s1, "") !== str):You can also check if the exact word is contained in a string. E.g.:Usage:This is how jQuery does its hasClass method.The includes() method determines whether one string may be found within another string, returning true or false as appropriate.Syntax :-string.includes(searchString[, position])searchString:-A string to be searched for within this string.position:-Optional. The position in this string at which to begin searching for searchString; defaults to 0.    If you are capable of using libraries, you may find that Lo-Dash JS library is quite useful. In this case, go ahead and check _.contains() (replaced by _.includes() as of v4).(Note Lo-Dash convention is naming the library object _.\nDon\'t forget to check installation in the same page to set it up for your project.)In your case, go ahead and use:..whichever one you like better.you can define an extension method and use it later.so that you can use in your page anywhere like:which returns true.Refer below post for more extension helper methods.\nJavascript helper methodsNone of the above worked for me as there were blank spaces  but this is what I did
