I have a UILabel with space for two lines of text. Sometimes, when the text is too short, this text is displayed in the vertical center of the label.How do I vertically align the text to always be at the top of the UILabel?There\'s no way to set the vertical align on a UILabel, but you can get the same effect by changing the label\'s frame. I\'ve made my labels orange so you can see clearly what\'s happening.Here\'s the quick and easy way to do this:If you have a label with longer text that will make more than one line, set numberOfLines to 0 (zero here means an unlimited number of lines).Longer VersionI\'ll make my label in code so that you can see what\'s going on. You can set up most of this in Interface Builder too. My setup is a View Based App with a background image I made in Photoshop to show margins (20 points). The label is an attractive orange color so you can see what\'s going on with the dimensions.Some limitations of using sizeToFit come into play with center- or right-aligned text. Here\'s what happens:The label is still sized with a fixed top-left corner. You can save the original label\'s width in a variable and set it after sizeToFit, or give it a fixed width to counter these problems:Note that sizeToFit will respect your initial label\'s minimum width. If you start with a label 100 wide and call sizeToFit on it, it will give you back a (possibly very tall) label with 100 (or a little less) width. You might want to set your label to the minimum width you want before resizing.Some other things to note:Whether lineBreakMode is respected depends on how it\'s set. NSLineBreakByTruncatingTail (the default) is ignored after sizeToFit, as are the other two truncation modes (head and middle). NSLineBreakByClipping is also ignored. NSLineBreakByCharWrapping works as usual. The frame width is still narrowed to fit to the rightmost letter.Mark Amery gave a fix for NIBs and Storyboards using Auto Layout in the comments:If your label is included in a nib or storyboard as a subview of the view of a ViewController that uses autolayout, then putting your sizeToFit call into viewDidLoad won\'t work, because autolayout sizes and positions the subviews after viewDidLoad is called and will immediately undo the effects of your sizeToFit call. However, calling sizeToFit from within viewDidLayoutSubviews will work.This uses the NSString method sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode: to calculate the frame height needed to fit a string, then sets the origin and width.Resize the frame for the label using the text you want to insert. That way you can accommodate any number of lines.This page has some different code for the same solution:discussions in apple1) Set the new text:myLabel.text = @"Some Text"2) Set the maximum number of lines to 0 (automatic):myLabel.numberOfLines = 03) Set the frame of the label to the maximum size:myLabel.frame = CGRectMake(20,20,200,800)4) Call sizeToFit to reduce the frame size so the contents just fit:[myLabel sizeToFit]The labels frame is now just high and wide enough to fit your text. The top left should be unchanged. I have tested this only with top left aligned text. For other alignments, you might have to modify the frame afterwards.Also, my label has word wrapping enabled.Refering to the extension solution:should be replaced by Additional space is needed in every added newline, because iPhone UILabels\' trailing carriage returns seems to be ignored :(Similarly, alignBottom should be updated too with a @" \\n@%" in place of "\\n@%" (for cycle initialization must be replaced by "for(int i=0..." too).The following extension works for me:Then call [yourLabel alignTop]; or [yourLabel alignBottom]; after each yourLabel text assignment.Just in case it\'s of any help to anyone, I had the same problem but was able to solve the issue simply by switching from using UILabel to using UITextView. I appreciate this isn\'t for everyone because the functionality is a bit different.If you do switch to using UITextView, you can turn off all the Scroll View properties as well as User Interaction Enabled... This will force it to act more like a label.Like the answer above, but it wasn\'t quite right, or easy to slap into code so I cleaned it up a bit.  Add this extension either to it\'s own .h and .m file or just paste right above the implementation you intend to use it:And then to use, put your text into the label, and then call the appropriate method to align it:orNo muss, no fussNo muss, no Objective-c, no fuss but Swift 3:An even quicker (and dirtier) way to accomplish this is by setting the UILabel\'s line break mode to "Clip" and adding a fixed amount of newlines.This solution won\'t work for everyone -- in particular, if you still want to show "..." at the end of your string if it exceeds the number of lines you\'re showing, you\'ll need to use one of the longer bits of code -- but for a lot of cases this\'ll get you what you need.Instead of UILabel you may use UITextField which has vertical alignment option:I\'ve struggled with this one for a long time and I wanted to share my solution.This will give you a UILabel that will autoshrink text down to 0.5 scales and vertically center the text. These options are also available in Storyboard/IB.Create a new class LabelTopAlign.h file.m fileHere\'s a simpler implementation that does the same:In Interface BuilderIn your codeCode Snippet:Create a subclass of UILabel. Works like a charm:As discussed here.I wrote a util function to achieve this purpose. You can take a look:\xef\xbc\x8eHow to use? (If lblHello is created by Interface builder, so I skip some UILabel attributes detail)I also wrote it on my blog as an article:\nhttp://fstoke.me/blog/?p=2819I took a while to read the code, as well as the code in the introduced page, and found that they all try to modify the frame size of label, so that the default center vertical alignment would not appear.However, in some cases we do want the label to occupy all those spaces, even if the label does have so much text (e.g. multiple rows with equal height).Here, I used an alternative way to solve it, by simply pad newlines to the end of label (pls note that I actually inherited the UILabel, but it is not necessary):For Adaptive UI(iOS8 or after) , Vertical Alignment of UILabel is to be set from StoryBoard by Changing the properties\n noOfLines=0` and ConstraintsAdjusting UILabel LefMargin, RightMargin and Top Margin Constraints.Change Content Compression Resistance Priority For Vertical=1000` So that   Vertical>Horizontal .Edited:and the following constraints are enough to achieve the desired results.I took the suggestions here and created a view which can wrap a UILabel and will size it and set the number of lines so that it is top aligned. Simply put a UILabel as a subview:You can use TTTAttributedLabel, it supports vertical alignment.I\'ve found the answers on this question are now a bit out-of-date, so adding this for the auto layout fans out there.Auto layout makes this issue pretty trivial. Assuming we\'re adding the label to UIView *view, the following code will accomplish this:The label\'s height will be calculated automatically (using it\'s intrinsicContentSize) and the label will be positioned edge-to-edge horizontally, at the top of the view.I wanted to have a label which was able to have multi-lines, a minimum font size, and centred both horizontally and vertically in it\'s parent view. I added my label programmatically to my view:And then when I wanted to change the text of my label...Hope that helps someone!FXLabel (on github) does this out of the box by setting label.contentMode to UIViewContentModeTop. This component is not made by me, but it is a component I use frequently and has tons of features, and seems to work well.I\'ve used a lot of the methods above, and just want to add a quick-and-dirty approach I\'ve used:Make sure the number of newlines in the string will cause any text to fill the available vertical space, and set the UILabel to truncate any overflowing text.Because sometimes good enough is good enough.for anyone reading this because the text inside your label is not vertically centered, keep in mind that some font types are not designed equally. for example, if you create a label with zapfino size 16, you will see the text is not perfectly centered vertically.however, working with helvetica will vertically center your text.Subclass UILabel and constrain the drawing rectangle, like this:I tried the solution involving newline padding and ran into incorrect behavior in some cases. In my experience, it\'s easier to constrain the drawing rect as above than mess with numberOfLines.P.S. You can imagine easily supporting UIViewContentMode this way:If you are using autolayout, set the vertical contentHuggingPriority to 1000, either in code or IB. In IB you may then have to remove a height constraint by setting it\'s priority to 1 and then deleting it.As long as you are not doing any complex task, you can use UITextView instead of UILabels.Disable the scroll.If you want the text to be displayed completely just user sizeToFit and sizeThatFits: methodsIf creating your own custom view is an option, you could do something like this:This is an old solution, use autolayout on iOS >= 6My solution:\n1/ Split lines by myself (ignoring label wrap settings)\n2/ Draw lines by myself (ignoring label alignment)I riffed off dalewking\'s suggestion and added a UIEdgeInset to allow for an adjustable margin. nice work around.I was working on that particular problem as well, so I\'ve taken the ideas by D.S. and nevan king and basically combined them into a subclass that implements a vertical alignment property, which also allows you to change the alignment more than just once. It borrows the UIControlContentVerticalAlignment type and also supports UIControlContentVerticalAlignmentFill.From what I\'ve seen, numberOfLines seems to be useless when it comes to vertical alignment, so in this subclass it is always set to 0 when applying vertical alignment.\nAlso, you still have to set lineBreakMode yourself in case you want a multi-line text label.There it is: QALabel on GitHubIn UILabel vertically text alignment is not possible. But, you can dynamically change the height of the label using sizeWithFont: method of NSString, and just set its x and y as you want.You can use UITextField. It supports the contentVerticalAlignment peoperty as it is a subclass of UIControl. You have to set its userInteractionEnabled to NO to prevent user from typing text on it.
