In my Android application, when I rotate the device (slide out the keyboard) then my Activity is restarted (onCreate is called). Now, this is probably how it\'s supposed to be, but I do a lot of initial setting up in the onCreate method, so I need either:Using the Application ClassDepending on what you\'re doing in your initialization you could consider creating a new class that extends Application and moving your initialization code into an overridden onCreate method within that class.The onCreate in the application class is only called when the entire application is created, so the Activity restarts on orientation or keyboard visibility changes won\'t trigger it.It\'s good practice to expose the instance of this class as a singleton and exposing the application variables you\'re initializing using getters and setters.NOTE: You\'ll need to specify the name of your new Application class in the manifest for it to be registered and used:Reacting to Configuration Changes [UPDATE: this is deprecated since API 13; see the recommended alternative]As a further alternative, you can have your application listen for events that would cause a restart \xe2\x80\x93 like orientation and keyboard visibility changes \xe2\x80\x93 and handle them within your Activity.Start by adding the android:configChanges node to your Activity\'s manifest nodeor for Android 3.2 (API level 13) and newer:Then within the Activity override the onConfigurationChanged method and call setContentView to force the GUI layout to be re-done in the new orientation.Update for Android 3.2 and higher:Caution: Beginning with Android 3.2 (API level 13), the "screen size" also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape orientation. Thus, if you want to prevent runtime restarts due to orientation change when developing for API level 13 or higher (as declared by the minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion attributes), you must include the "screenSize" value in addition to the "orientation" value. That is, you must declare android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize". However, if your application targets API level 12 or lower, then your activity always handles this configuration change itself (this configuration change does not restart your activity, even when running on an Android 3.2 or higher device).Instead of trying to stop the onCreate() from being fired altogether, maybe try checking the Bundle savedInstanceState being passed into the event to see if it is null or not. For instance, if I have some logic that should be run when the Activity is truly created, not on every orientation change, I only run that logic in the onCreate() only if the savedInstanceState is null.  Otherwise, I still want the layout to redraw properly for the orientation.not sure if this is the ultimate answer, but it works for me. what I did...in the manifest, to the activity section, added:in the code for the activity, implemented:What you describe is the default behavior.  You have to detect and handle these events yourself by adding:to your manifest and then the changes that you want to handle.  So for orientation, you would use:and for the keyboard being opened or closed you would use:If you want to handle both you can just separate them with the pipe command like:This will trigger the onConfigurationChanged method in whatever Activity you call.  If you override the method you can pass in the new values.Hope this helps.I just discovered this lore:For keeping the Activity alive through an orientation change, and handling it through onConfigurationChanged, the documentation and the code sample above suggest this in the Manifest file:which has the extra benefit that it always works.The bonus lore is that omitting the keyboardHidden may seem logical, but it causes failures in the emulator (for Android 2.1 at least): specifying only orientation will make the emulator call both OnCreate and onConfigurationChanged sometimes, and only OnCreate other times.I haven\'t seen the failure on a device, but I have heard about the emulator failing for others.  So it\'s worth documenting.You might also consider using the Android platform\'s way of persisting data across orientation changes:  onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() and getLastNonConfigurationInstance().This allows you to persist data across configuration changes, such as information you may have gotten from a server fetch or something else that\'s been computed in onCreate or since, while also allowing Android to re-layout your Activity using the xml file for the orientation now in use.See here or here.It should be noted that these methods are now deprecated (although still more flexible than handling orientation change yourself as most of the above solutions suggest) with the recommendation that everyone switch to Fragments and instead use setRetainInstance(true) on each Fragment you want to retain.The approach is useful but is incomplete when using Fragments.Fragments usually get recreated on configuration change. If you don\'t wish this to happen, usesetRetainInstance(true); in the Fragment\'s constructor(s)This will cause fragments to be retained during configuration change.http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html#setRetainInstance(boolean)I just simply added in the manifest file and did not add any onConfigurationChanged method in my activity.So every time the keyboard slides out or in nothing happens.What part of the manifest tells it "don\'t call onCreate()"?Also,\nGoogle\'s docs say to avoid using android:configChanges (except as a last resort).... But then the alternate methods they suggest all DO use android:configChanges.It has been my experience that the emulator ALWAYS calls onCreate() upon rotation.\nBut the 1-2 devices that I run the same code on... do not.\n(Not sure why there would be any difference.)Changes to be made in the Android manifest are:Additions to be made inside activity are:Add this line to your manifest :- and this snippet to the activity :-The way I have found to do this is use the onRestoreInstanceState and the onSaveInstanceState events to save something in the Bundle (even if you dont need any variables saved, just put something in there so the Bundle isn\'t empty). Then, on the onCreate method, check to see if the Bundle is empty, and if it is, then do the initialization, if not, then do it.There are several ways to do this:You can save the activity state in onSaveInstanceState.and then use the bundle to restore the state.Another alternative is to handle the orientation changes by yourself. But this is not considered a good practice.Add this to your manifest file.for Android 3.2 and later:You can also confine your activity to portrait or landscape mode to avoid rotation.Add this to the activity tag in your manifest file:Or implement this programmatically in your activity:The onCreate method is still called even when you change the orientation of android. So moving all the heavy functionality to this method is not going to help youEven though it is not "the Android way" I have gotten very good results by handling orientation changes myself and simply repositioning the widgets within a view to take the altered orientation into account.  This is faster than any other approach, because your views do not have to be saved and restored.  It also provides a more seamless experience to the user, because the respositioned widgets are exactly the same widgets, just moved and/or resized.  Not only model state, but also view state, can be preserved in this manner.RelativeLayout can sometimes be a good choice for a view that has to reorient itself from time to time.  You just provide a set of portrait layout params and a set of landscaped layout params, with different relative positioning rules on each, for each child widget.  Then, in your onConfigurationChanged() method, you pass the appropriate one to a setLayoutParams() call on each child.  If any child control itself needs to be internally reoriented, you just call a method on that child to perform the reorientation.  That child similarly calls methods on any of its child controls that need internal reorientation, and so on.It is very simple just do the following steps:This works for me :Note: orientation depends on your requitementPut below code inside your  <activity> tag in Manifest.xmlandroid:configChanges="screenLayout|screenSize|orientation"Note: I post this answer if someone in the future face the same problem as me. For me the following line wasn\'t enought:When I rotated the screen, the method `onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) did\'t get called.Solution: I also had to add "screenSize" even if the problem had to do with the orientation. So in the AndroidManifest.xml - file, add this:Then implement the method onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) Every time when screen is rotated, opened activity is finished and onCreate() is called again.1 . You can do one thing save the state of activity when screen is rotated so that, You can recover all old stuff when activity\'s onCreate() is called again.\n    Refer this  link2 . If you want to prevent restarting of the activity just place following lines in your manifest.xml file.Fix the screen orientation (landscape or portrait) in AndroidManifest.xmlandroid:screenOrientation="portrait" or android:screenOrientation="landscape"for this your onResume() method is not called.you need to use the onSavedInstanceState method to store all the value to its parameter is has that is bundle and use to retrive and set the value to view objects\nit will handles the screen rotations In the activity section of the manifest, add:After a while of trial and error, I found a solution which fits my needs in the most situations. Here is the Code:Manifest configuration:MainActivity:And sample Fragment:Can be found on github.Use orientation listener to perform different tasks on different orientation.Put this below code in your Activity in Android Manifest.This will not restart your activity when you would change orientation.You can lock to the current orientation of screen using this code...
