I have one text input and one button (see below). How can I use JavaScript to trigger the button\'s click event when the Enter key is pressed inside the text box?There is already a different submit button on my current page, so I can\'t simply make the button a submit button. And, I only want the Enter key to click this specific button if it is pressed from within this one text box, nothing else.In jQuery, the following would work:Or in plain JavaScript, the following would work:Then just code it in!Figured this out:Make the button a submit element, so it\'ll be automatic.Note that you\'ll need a <form> element containing the input fields to make this work (thanks Sergey Ilinsky).It\'s not a good practice to redefine standard behaviour, the Enter key should always call the submit button on a form.Since no one has used addEventListener yet, here is my version. Given the elements:I would use the following:This allows you to change the event type and action separately while keeping the HTML clean.Note that it\'s probably worthwhile to make sure this is outside of a <form> because when I enclosed these elements in them pressing Enter submitted the form and reloaded the page. Took me a few blinks to discover.Addendum: Thanks to a comment by @ruffin, I\'ve added the missing event handler and a preventDefault to allow this code to (presumably) work inside a form as well. (I will get around to testing this, at which point I will remove the bracketed content.)In plain JavaScript,I noticed that the reply is given in jQuery only, so I thought of giving something in plain JavaScript as well.One basic trick you can use for this that I haven\'t seen fully mentioned.  If you want to do an ajax action, or some other work on Enter but don\'t want to actually submit a form you can do this:Setting action="javascript:void(0);" like this is a shortcut for preventing default behavior essentially.  In this case a method is called whether you hit enter or click the button and an ajax call is made to load some data.To trigger a search every time the enter key is pressed, use this:Try it:This is just something I have from a somewhat recent project... I found it on the net, and I have no idea if there\'s a better way or not in plain old JavaScript.Although, I\'m pretty sure that as long as there is only one field in the form and one submit button, hitting enter should submit the form, even if there is another form on the page.You can then capture the form onsubmit with js and do whatever validation or callbacks you want.This is a solution for all the YUI lovers out there:In this special case I did have better results using YUI for triggering DOM objects that have been injected with button functionality - but this is another story...This onchange attempt is close, but misbehaves with respect to browser back then forward  (on Safari 4.0.5 and Firefox 3.6.3), so ultimately, I wouldn\'t recommend it.Use it when handling the event or in the function your event handler calls.It works in Internet Explorer and Opera at least.For jquery mobile I had to doThis in-case you want also diable the enter button from Posting to server and execute the Js script. In Angular2:If you don\'t want some visual feedback in the button, it\'s a good design to not reference the button but rather directly invoke the controller.Also, the id isn\'t needed - another NG2 way of separating between the view and the model.To add a completely plain JavaScript solution that addressed @icedwater\'s issue with form submission, here\'s a complete solution with form.NOTE: This is for "modern browsers", including IE9+. The IE8 version isn\'t much more complicated, and can be learned here.Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/rufwork/gm6h25th/1/Heres my two cents. I am working on an app for Windows 8 and want the button to register a click event when I press the Enter button. I am doing this in JS. I tried a couple of suggestions, but had issues. This works just fine.To do it with jQuery:To do it with normal JavaScript:Nobody noticed the html attibute "accesskey" which is avalaible since a while. This is a no javascript way to keyboard shorcut stuffs.The accesskey attributes shortcuts on MDNIntented to be used like this. The html attribute itself is enough, howewer we can change the placeholder or other indicator depending of the browser and os. The script is a untested scratch approach to give an idea. You may want to use a browser library detector like the tiny bowserThis also might help, a small JavaScript function, which works fine:I know this question is solved, but I just found something, which can be helpful for others.
