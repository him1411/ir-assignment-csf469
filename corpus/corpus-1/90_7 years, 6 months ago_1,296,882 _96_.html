Within my master branch, I did a git merge some-other-branch locally, but never pushed the changes to origin master. I didn\'t mean to merge, so I\'d like to undo it. When doing a git status after my merge, I was getting this message:Based upon some instructions I found, I tried runningbut now I\'m getting this message with git status:I don\'t want my branch to be ahead by any number of commits. How do I get back to that point?With git reflog check which commit is one prior the merge(git reflog will be better option than git log ). Then you can reset it using:There\'s also another waywill get you back 1 commit.Be aware that any modified and uncommitted/unstashed files will be reset to their unmodified state. To keep them either stash changes away or see --merge option below.  As @Velmont suggested below in his answer, in this direct case using:might yield better results, as it should preserve your changes. ORIG_HEAD will point to a commit directly before merge has occurred, so you don\'t have to hunt for it yourself.A tips is to use the --merge switch instead of --hard, it doesn\'t reset files unnecessarily:--mergeResets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are different between <commit> and HEAD, but keeps those which are different between the index and working tree (i.e. which have changes which have not been added).      Assuming your local master was not ahead of origin/master, you should be able to doThen your local master branch should look identical to origin/master.See chapter 4 in the Git book and the original post by Linus Torvalds.To undo a merge that was already pushed:Be sure to revert the revert if you\'re committing the branch again, like Linus said.It is strange that the simplest command was missing. Most answers work, but undoing the merge you just did, this is the easy and safe way:The ref ORIG_HEAD will point to the original commit from before the merge.(The --merge option has nothing to do with the merge. It\'s just like git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD, but safer since it doesn\'t touch uncommitted changes.)With newer Git versions, if you have not committed the merge yet and you have a merge conflict, you can simply do:From man git merge:[This] can only be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts. git merge --abort will abort the merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state.You should reset to the previous commit. This should work:Or even HEAD^^ to revert that revert commit. You can always give a full SHA reference if you\'re not sure how many steps back you should take.In case when you have problems and your master branch didn\'t have any local changes, you can reset to origin/master.Lately, I\'ve been using git reflog to help with this. This mostly only works if the merge JUST happened, and it was on your machine. git reflog might return something like:The first line indicates that a merge occurred. The 2nd line is the time before my merge. I simply git reset --hard 43b6032 to force this branch to track from before the merge, and carry-on.With modern Git, you can:Older syntax:Old-school:But actually, it is worth noticing that git merge --abort is only equivalent to git reset --merge given that MERGE_HEAD is present. This can be read in the Git help for merge command.After a failed merge, when there is no MERGE_HEAD, the failed merge can be undone with git reset --merge, but not necessarily with git merge --abort, so they are not only old and new syntax for the same thing.Personally I find git reset --merge much more powerful and useful in everyday work, so that\'s the one I always use.Okay, the answers other people here gave me were close, but it didn\'t work. Here\'s what I did.Doing this......gave me the following status.I then had to type in the same git reset command several more times.  Each time I did that, the message changed by one as you can see below.At this point, I saw the status message changed, so I tried doing a git pull, and that seemed to work:So long story short, my commands came down to this:You could use git reflog to find the previous checkout. Sometimes that\'s a good state you want to return back to.Concretely,Just for an extra option to look at, I\'ve been mostly following the branching model described here: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ and as such have been merging with --no-ff (no fast forward) usually.  I just read this page as I\'d accidentally merged a testing branch instead of my release branch with master for deploying (website, master is what is live).  The testing branch has two other branches merged to it and totals about six commits.  So to revert the whole commit I just needed one git reset --hard HEAD^ and it reverted the whole merge.  Since the merges weren\'t fast forwarded the merge was a block and one step back is "branch not merged".If you didn\'t commit it yet, you can only useIt will undo the merge (and everything that you did).You can use only two commands to revert a merge or restart by a specific commit:Good luck and go ahead!Got to this question also looking to revert to match origin (ie, NO commits ahead of origin). Researching further, found there\'s a reset command for exactly that:git reset --hard @{u}Note: @{u} is shorthand for origin/master. (And, of course, you need that remote repository for this to work.)If your merge and the corresponding commits were not pushed yet, you can always switch to another branch, delete the original one and re-create it.For example, I accidentally merged a develop branch into master and wanted to undo that. Using the following steps:Voila! Master is at the same stage as origin, and your mis-merged state is erased.If you want a command-line solution, I suggest to just go with MBO\'s answer.If you\'re a newbie, you might like the graphical approach:Strategy: Create a new branch from where everything was good.Rationale: Reverting a merge is hard. There are too many solutions, depending on many factors such as whether you\'ve committed or pushed your merge or if there were new commits since your merge. Also you still need to have a relatively deep understanding of git to adapt these solutions to your case. If you blindly follow some instructions, you can end up with an "empty merge" where nothing will be merged, and further merge attempts will make Git tell you "Already up to date".Solution:Let\'s say you want to merge dev into feature-1.Find the revision that you want to receive the merge:Check it out (go back in time):Create a new branch from there and check it out:Now you can restart your merge:Merge: git merge devFix your merge conflicts.Commit: git commitWhen you\'re satisfied with the results, delete the old branch: git branch --delete feature-1I know it\'s not a direct response to the question, but having in mind how complicated this issue is to the history of the repository, I wanted to share my experience and let everybody know that creating a new branch from the last commit before the merge could be a good alternative, mostly when the merge was already pushed.I think you can do git rebase -i [hash] [branch_name]  where [hash] is the identifying hash for however far back you want to rewind plus one (or however many commits back you want to go) and then delete the lines for the commits in the editor that you don\'t want any more. Save the file. Exit. Pray. And it should be rewound. You might have to do a git reset --hard, but it should be good at this point. You can also use this to pull specific commits out of a stack, if you don\'t want to keep them in your history, but that can leave your repository in a state that you probably don\'t want.First, make sure that you\'ve committed everything.Then reset your repository to the previous working state:or using --hard (this will remove all local, not committed changes!):Use the hash which was there before your wrongly merged commit.Check which commits you\'d like to re-commit on the top of the previous correct version by:Apply your right commits on the top of the right version of your repository by:By using cherry-pick (the changes introduced by some existing commits)Or by cherry-picking the range of commits by:First checking the right changes before merging them:First checking the right changes before merging them:where this is the range of the correct commits which you\'ve committed (excluding wrongly committed merge).If you notice that you need to revert immediately after the merge and you haven\'t done anything else after the merge attempt, you can just issue this command:\ngit reset --hard HEAD@{1}.Essentially, your merge sha will be pointing to HEAD@{0} if nothing else was committed after the merge and so HEAD@{1} will be the previous point before the merge.The simplest of the simplest chance, much simpler than anything said here:Remove your local branch (local, not remote) and pull it again. This way you\'ll undo the changes on your master branch and anyone will be affected by the change you don\'t want to push. Start it over.If you committed the merge:You can use the git-reset command.git-reset - Reset current HEAD to thespecified state. git reset [--mixed |--soft | --hard | --merge] [-q] [] git reset [-q] [][--] \xe2\x80\xa6 git reset --patch[] [--] [\xe2\x80\xa6]GIT-Reset
