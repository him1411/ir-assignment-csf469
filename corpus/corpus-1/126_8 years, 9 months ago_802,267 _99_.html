Is there a (unix) shell script to format JSON in human-readable form?Basically, I want it to transform the following:... into something like this:With Python 2.6+ you can just do:or, if the JSON is in a file, you can do:if the JSON is from an internet source such as an API, you can useFor convenience in all of these cases you can make an alias:For even more convenience with a bit more typing to get it ready:for all the above cases. You can put this in .bashrc and it will be available every time in shell. Invoke it like prettyjson_s \'{"foo": "lorem", "bar": "ipsum"}\'.You can use: jqIt\'s very simple to use and it works great! It can handle very large JSON structures, including streams.  You can find\ntheir tutorials here.Here is an example:Or in other words:I use the "space" argument of JSON.stringify to pretty-print JSON in javascript.Examples:From the Unix command-line with nodejs, specifying json on the command line:Returns:From the Unix command-line with nodejs, specifying a filename that contains json, and using an indent of 4 spaces:Using a pipe:I wrote a tool that has one of the best "smart whitespace" formatters available.  It produces more readable and less verbose output than most of the other options here.underscore-cliThis is what "smart whitespace" looks like:I may be a bit biased, but it\'s an awesome tool for printing and manipulating JSON data from the command-line.  It\'s super-friendly to use and has extensive command-line help/documentation.  It\'s a swiss-army-knife that I use for 1001 different small tasks that would be surprisingly annoying to do any other way.  Latest use-case: Chrome, Dev console, Network tab, export all as HAR file, "cat site.har | underscore select \'.url\' --outfmt text | grep mydomain"; now I have a chronologically ordered list of all url fetches made during the loading of my comany\'s site.Pretty printing is easy:same thing:same thing, more explicit:This tool is my current passion project, so if you have any feature requests, good chance I\'ll address them.i usually just do and to retrieve select data (In this case "test"\'s value):If the json data is in a file:If you want to do it all in one go with curl on the command line using an auth tokenThanks to J.F. Sebastian\'s very helpful pointers, here\'s a slightly enhanced script I\'ve come up with:The JSON Ruby Gem is bundled with a shell script to prettify JSON:Script download:  gist.github.com/3738968On *nix, reading from stdin and writing to stdout works better:Put this in a file (I named mine "prettyJSON" after AnC\'s answer) in your PATH and chmod +x it, and you\'re good to go.With Perl, use the CPAN module JSON::XS. It installs a command line tool json_xs.Validate:Prettify the JSON file src.json to pretty.json:If you don\'t have json_xs, try json_pp . "pp" is for "pure perl" â€“ the tool is implemented in Perl only, without a binding to an external C library (which is what XS stands for, Perl\'s "Extension System").If you use npm and nodejs, you can do npm install -g json and then pipe the command through json.  Do json -h to get all the options.  It can also pull out specific fields and colorize the output with -i.UPDATE I\'m using jq now as suggested in another answer. It\'s extremely powerful at filtering JSON, but, at it\'s most basic, also an awesome way to pretty print JSON for viewing.jsonpp is a very nice command line JSON pretty printer.From the README:Pretty print web service responses like so:and make beautiful the files running around on your disk:If you\'re on Mac OS X, you can brew install jsonpp. If not, you can simply copy the binary to somewhere in your $PATHTry pjson. It has colors!Install it with pip:\xe2\x9a\xa1 pip install pjson\nand then, pipe any json content to pjson.I use jshon - to do exactly what you\'re describing, just run:You can also pass arguments to transform the json data.Check out Jazor. It\'s a simple command line JSON parser written in Ruby.NOTE: It is not the way to do it.The same in Perl:Note 2:\nIf you runthe nicely readable word becomes \\u encodedIf the remainder of your pipeline will gracefully handle unicode and you\'d like your JSON to also be human-friendly, simply use ensure_ascii=Falseand you\'ll get:Or, with Ruby:Simply pipe the output to jq ..Example:JSONLint has an open-source implementation on github can be used on the command line or included in a node.js project.and thenorIs it too simple with native way with jq tools - https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/for example: cat xxx | jq \'.\'I recommend using the json_xs command line utility which is included in the JSON::XS perl module. JSON::XS is a perl module for serializing/deserializing JSON, on a Debian or Ubuntu machine you can install it like this:It is obviously also avalible on cpan.To use it to format json obtained from a url you can use curl or wget like this:or this:and to format json contained in a file you can do this:To reformat as YAML, which some people consider to be more humanly-readable than JSON:With Perl, if you install JSON::PP from CPAN you\'ll get the json_pp command.  Stealing the example from B Bycroft you get:It\'s worth mentioning that json_pp comes pre-installed with Ubuntu 12.04 (at least) and Debian in /usr/bin/json_ppI combine python json.tool with pygmentizeThere are some alternatives to pygmentize which are listed in my this answer.Here is a live demo:Install yajl-tools with the command below:sudo apt-get install yajl-toolsthen,echo \'{"foo": "lorem", "bar": "ipsum"}\' | json_reformatyajl is very nice, in my experience. I use its json_reformat command to pretty-print .json files in vim by putting the following line in my .vimrc:I\'m using httpieAnd you can use it like thisThe PHP version, if you have PHP >= 5.4.That\'s how i do it:short code and gets the job done.I know this question has been replied ad nauseam, but I wanted to document a Ruby solution that is better than Json\'s prettify command, the gem colorful_json is fairly good.There is  TidyJSON it\'s C#, so maybe you can get it to compile with Mono, and working on *nix. No guarantees though, sorry.The tool ydump is a JSON pretty-printer:Or you can pipe in the JSON:This is probably the shortest solution apart from using the jq tool.This tool is part of the yojson library for OCaml, and is documented here.On Debian and derivatives, the package libyojson-ocaml-dev contains this tool. Alternatively, yojson can be installed via OPAM.
