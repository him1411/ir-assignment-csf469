I\'d like to tell the difference between valid and invalid date objects in JS, but couldn\'t figure out how:Any ideas for writing an isValidDate function?Here\'s how I would do it:Instead of using "new Date()" you should use:Date.parse() returns a timestamp, an integer representing the number of milliseconds since 01/Jan/1970.  It will return NaN if it cannot parse the supplied date string.You can check the validity of a Date object d viaTo avoid cross-frame issues, one could replace the instanceof check withA call to getTime() as in Borgar\'s answer is unnecessary as isNaN() and isFinite() both implicitly convert to number.My solution is for simply checking whether you get a valid date object:Would like to mention that the jQuery UI DatePicker widget has a very good date validator utility method that checks for format and validity (e.g., no 01/33/2013 dates allowed).Even if you don\'t want to use the datepicker widget on your page as a UI element, you can always add its .js library to your page and then call the validator method, passing the value you want to validate into it.  To make life even easier, it takes a string as input, not a JavaScript Date object.See: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/It\'s not listed as a method, but it is there-- as a utility function.  Search the page for "parsedate" and you\'ll find:$.datepicker.parseDate( format, value, settings ) - Extract a date from a string value with a specified format.Example usage:(More info re specifying date formats is found at http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#utility-parseDate)In the above example, you wouldn\'t see the alert message since \'01/03/2012\' is a calendar-valid date in the specified format.  However if you made \'stringval\' equal to \'13/04/2013\', for example, you would get the alert message, since the value \'13/04/2013\' is not calendar-valid.If a passed-in string value is successfully parsed, the value of \'testdate\' would be a Javascript Date object representing the passed-in string value.  If not, it\'d be undefined.Here is an example:The validation section in the documentation is quite clear.And also, the following parsing flags result in an invalid date:Source: http://momentjs.com/docs/shortest answer to check valid dateI really liked Christoph\'s approach (but didn\'t have enough of a reputation to vote it up). \nFor my use, I know I will always have a Date object so I just extended date with a valid() method.Now I can just write this and it\'s much more descriptive than just checking isFinite in code...I use the following code to validate values for year, month and date.For details, refer to Check date in javascriptFor Angular.js projects you can use:Nice solution! Included in my library of auxiliary functions, now it looks like this:This just worked for meHowever this didn\'t workToo many complicated answers here already, but a simple line is sufficient (ES5): or even in ES6 :None of the above solutions worked for me what did work however isthe code above will see when JS makes 02/31/2012 into 03/02/2012 that its not validNone of these answers worked for me (tested in Safari 6.0) when trying to validate a date such as 2/31/2012, however, they work fine when trying any date greater than 31.So I had to brute force a little. Assuming the date is in the format mm/dd/yyyy. I am using @broox answer:I\'ve written this function. Pass it a string parameter and it will determine whether it\'s a valid date or not based on this format "dd/MM/yyyy".  here is a testinput: "hahaha",output: false.input: "29/2/2000",output: true. input: "29/2/2001",output: false. Inspired by Borgar\'s approach I have made sure that the code not only validates the date, but actually makes sure the date is a real date, meaning that dates like 31/09/2011 and 29/02/2011 are not allowed.Date object to string is more simple and reliable way to detect if both fields are valid date. \ne.g. If you enter this "-------" to the date input field. Some of the above answers won\'t work.you can convert your date and time to milliseconds getTime()this getTime() Method return Not a Number NaN when not valid The selected answer is excellent, and I\'m using it as well.  However, if you\'re looking for a way to validate user date input, you should be aware that the Date object is very persistent about making what might appear to be invalid construction arguments into valid ones.  The following unit test code illustrates the point:I combined the best performance results I found around that check if a given object:The result is the following:Call it like thisI think some of this is a long process. We can cut it short as shown below:you can check the valid format of txDate.value with this scirpt. if it was in incorrect format  the Date obejct not instanced and return null to dt .Generally I\'d stick with whatever Date implantation is in the browser stack. Which means you will always get "Invalid Date" when calling toDateString() in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari as of this reply\'s date. I did not test this in IE though.This flavor of isValidDate uses a regular expression that handles leap years:A ready function based on top rated answer:
