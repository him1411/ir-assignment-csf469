I wanted to test if a key exists in a dictionary before updating the value for the key.\nI wrote the following code:I think this is not the best way to accomplish this task. Is there a better way to test for a key in the dictionary?in is the intended way to test for the existence of a key in a dict.If you wanted a default, you can always use dict.get():... and if you wanted to always ensure a default value for any key you can use defaultdict from the collections module, like so:... but in general, the in keyword is the best way to do it.You don\'t have to call keys:That will be much faster as it uses the dictionary\'s hashing as opposed to doing a linear search, which calling keys would do.You can test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, using the in keyword:A common use for checking the existence of a key in a dictionary before mutating it is to default-initialize the value (e.g. if your values are lists, for example, and you want to ensure that there is an empty list to which you can append when inserting the first value for a key). In cases such as those, you may find the collections.defaultdict() type to be of interest.In older code, you may also find some uses of has_key(), a deprecated method for checking the existence of keys in dictionaries (just use key_name in dict_name, instead).You can shorten this:However, this is at best a cosmetic improvement. Why do you believe this is not the best way?I would recommend using the setdefault method instead.  It sounds like it will do everything you want.For additional info on speed execution of the accepted answer\'s proposed methods (10m loops):Therefore using in or defaultdict are recommended against get.For checking you can use has_key() method If you want a value then you can use get() methodIf you want a tuple or list or dictionary or any string  as a default value as return value, then use get() methodJust an FYI adding to Chris. B (best answer):Works as well; the reason is that calling int() returns 0 which is what defaultdict does behind the scenes (when constructing a dictionary), hence the name "Factory Function" in the documentation.You can use the has_key() method:Or the dict.get method to set a default value if not found:The ways in which you can get the results are:Which is better is dependent on 3 things:Read More: http://paltman.com/try-except-performance-in-python-a-simple-test/Use of try/block instead of \'in\' or \'if\':What about using EAFP (easier to ask forgiveness than permission):See other SO posts:Using try vs if in python orChecking for member existence in Pythonprint dict.get(\'key1\', \'blah\')Won\'t print boo for the values in the dict, but accomplishes the goal by printing the value of key1 to confirm it\'s existence instead.Dictionary in python has a get(\'key\', default) method. So you can just set a default value in case there is no key. \n\nvalues = {...}\nmyValue = values.get(\'Key\', None)\nPython dictionary has the method called __contains__. This method will return True if the dictionary has the key else returns False.Using ternary operator:Easiest one is if you know which key(key name) is to look for:or you can also do simply as:
