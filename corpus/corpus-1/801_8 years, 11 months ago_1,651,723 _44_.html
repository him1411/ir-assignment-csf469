How do I query an Oracle database to display the names of all tables in it?assuming that you have access to the DBA_TABLES data dictionary view.  If you do not have those privileges but need them, you can request that the DBA explicitly grants you privileges on that table or that the DBA grants you the SELECT ANY DICTIONARY privilege or the SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE role (either of which would allow you to query any data dictionary table).  Of course, you may want to exclude certain schemas like SYS and SYSTEM which have large numbers of Oracle tables that you probably don\'t care about.Alternatively, if you do not have access to DBA_TABLES, you can see all the tables that your account has access to through the ALL_TABLES viewalthough that may be a subset of the tables available in the database (ALL_TABLES shows you the information for all the tables that your user has been granted access to).  If you are only concerned with the tables that you own, not those that you have access to, you could use USER_TABLESSince USER_TABLES only has information about the tables that you own, it does not have an OWNER column-- the owner, by definition, is you.Oracle also has a number of legacy data dictionary views-- TAB, DICT, TABS, and CAT for example-- that could be used.  In general, I would not suggest using these legacy views unless you absolutely need to backport your scripts to Oracle 6.  Oracle has not changed these views in a long time so they often have problems with newer types of objects.  For example, the TAB and CAT views both show information about tables that are in the user\'s recycle bin while the [DBA|ALL|USER]_TABLES views all filter those out.  CAT also shows information about materialized view logs with a TABLE_TYPE of "TABLE" which is unlikely to be what you really want.  DICT combines tables and synonyms and doesn\'t tell you who owns the object.Querying user_tables and dba_tables didn\'t work.\nThis one did:  Going one step further, there is another view called cols (all_tab_columns) which can be used to ascertain which tables contain a given column name.For example:to find all tables having a name beginning with EST and columns containing CALLREF anywhere in their names.This can help when working out what columns you want to join on, for example, depending on your table and column naming conventions.If you\'re using sqlplus you may want to first set up a few parameters for nicer viewing if your columns are getting mangled (these variables should not persist after you exit your sqlplus session ):You can then use something like this to see all table names:As @Justin Cave mentions, you can use this to show only tables that you own:Keep in mind that some "tables" may actually be "views" so you can also try running something like:This should yield something that looks fairly acceptable like:Simple query to select the tables for the current user:----------------OR----------------------------------OR------------------Try the below data dictionary views.Try selecting from user_tables which lists the tables owned by the current user.With any of those, you can select:gives all the tables of all the users only if the user with which you logged in is having the sysdba privileges.There exists 3 datadictinary for thisDBA_TABLES describes all relational tables in the database.Description of relational tables accessible to the userUSER_TABLES describes the relational tables owned by the current user. This view does not display the OWNER column.I did not find answer which would point to use so decided to add my version as well.\nThis view actually returns more that DBA_TABLES as it returns object tables as well (http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e40402/statviews_1003.htm).You can use Oracle Data Dictionary to get information about oracle objects.You can get list of tables in different ways:or for example:Then you can get table columns using table name:Then you can get list of dependencies (triggers, views and etc.):Then you can get text source of this objects:And you can use USER or ALL views instead of DBA if you want.The following query only list the required data, whereas the other answers gave me the extra data which only confused me.Oracle database to display the names of all tables using below queryvist more : http://www.oracleinformation.com/2016/08/get-list-of-all-tables-in-oracle-sql.htmlSelect * from dba_tables; -- need to have select catalog roleSelect * from user_tables;-- to see tables of your schemaSelect * from all_tables; -- tables inside your schma and tables of orher schema which you possess select grants on
