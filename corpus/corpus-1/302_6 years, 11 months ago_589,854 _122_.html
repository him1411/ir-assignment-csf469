How do I install a specific version of a formula in homebrew?  For example, postgresql-8.4.4 instead of the latest 9.0.(I\xe2\x80\x99ve re-edited my answer to give a more thorough workflow for installing/using older software versions with homebrew. Feel free to add a note if you found the old version better.)Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the simplest case:When homebrew installs a new formula, it puts it in a versioned directory like /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.1. Only symbolic links to this folder are then installed globally. In principle, this makes it pretty easy to switch between two installed versions. (*)If you have been using homebrew for longer and never removed older versions (using, for example brew cleanup), chances are that some older version of your program may still be around. If you want to simply activate that previous version, brew switch is the easiest way to do this.Check with brew info postgresql (or brew switch postgresql <TAB>) whether the older version is installed:We see that some older version is already installed. We may activate it using brew switch:Let\xe2\x80\x99s double-check what is activated:Note that the star * has moved to the newly activated version(*) Please note that brew switch only works as long as all dependencies of the older version are still around. In some cases, a rebuild of the older version may become necessary. Therefore, using brew switch is mostly useful when one wants to switch between two versions not too far apart.Especially for larger software projects, it is very probably that there is a high enough demand for several (potentially API incompatible) major versions of a certain piece of software. As of March 2012, Homebrew 0.9 provides a mechanism for this: brew tap & the homebrew versions repository.That versions repository may include backports of older versions for several formulae. (Mostly only the large and famous ones, but of course they\xe2\x80\x99ll also have several formulae for postgresql.)brew search postgresql will show you where to look:We can simply install it by typingNote that this has automatically tapped the homebrew/versions tap. (Check with brew tap, remove with brew untap homebrew/versions.) The following would have been equivalent:As long as the backported version formulae stay up-to-date, this approach is probably the best way to deal with older software.The following approaches are listed mostly for completeness. Both try to resurrect some undead formula from the brew repository. Due to changed dependencies, API changes in the formula spec or simply a change in the download URL, things may or may not work.Since the whole formula directory is a git repository, one can install specific versions using plain git commands. However, we need to find a way to get to a commit where the old version was available.a) historic timesBetween August 2011 and October 2014, homebrew had a brew versions command, which spat out all available versions with their respective SHA hashes. As of October 2014, you have to do a brew tap homebrew/boneyard before you can use it. As the name of the tap suggests, you should probably only do this as a last resort.E.g.As you can see, it advises against using it. Homebrew spits out all versions it can find with its internal heuristic and shows you a way to retrieve the old formulae. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try it.Now that the older postgresql version is installed, we can re-install the latest formula in order to keep our repository clean:brew switch is your friend to change between the old and the new.b) prehistoric timesFor special needs, we may also try our own digging through the homebrew repo.git log -S looks for all commits in which the string \'8.4.4\' was either added or removed in the file Library/Formula/postgresql.rb. We get two commits as a result.Obviously, fa992c6a82eebdc4cc36a0c0d2837f4c02f3f422 is the commit we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in. As this commit is pretty old, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to downgrade the complete homebrew installation (that way, the formula API is more or less guaranteed to be valid):You may skip the last command to keep the reference in your git repository.One note: When checking out the older commit, you temporarily downgrade your homebrew installation. So, you should be careful as some commands in homebrew might be different to the most recent version.It\xe2\x80\x99s not too hard and you may then upload it to Homebrew-Versions.If you want to keep a certain version of, say postgresql, around and stop it from being updated when you do the natural brew update; brew upgrade procedure, you can pin a formula:Pinned formulae are listed in /usr/local/Library/PinnedKegs/ and once you want to bring in the latest changes and updates, you can unpin it again:Now that Homebrew/versions has been deprecated, Homebrew/core supports multiple versions of formulae with a new naming format. To install a specific version, e.g. postgresql 9.5 you simply runbrew install postgresql@9.5Add the homebrew/versions repository to your installable options:brew tap homebrew/versionsYou can now install other versions that are maintained in repository:\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versionsNote: If you need another version as specified in this repository then you can create a recipe (maybe based on another version as starting point) and send a pull request to that repo.Navigate to your homebrew base directory (usually this is /usr/local)\nExample: Or, you can doEnter brew versions <formula> ( is the formula you want to install).You will then get something like:Choose the desired version and check it out via copy and paste of the desired version line (leave out the version number in the beginning). Example for getting 1.0.0:Do this if you already have another version installed.DONE, you can now use brew switch <formula> <version> to switch between versions.\nThere\'s now a much easier way to install an older version of a formula that you\'d previously installed. Simply useFor instance, I alternate regularly between Node.js 0.4.12 and 0.6.5:Since brew switch just changes the symlinks, it\'s very fast. See further documentation on the Homebrew Wiki under External Commands.Update: 1/15/2015From this gistI\'ve discovered a better alternative solution then the other complex solutions. This will download and install PostgreSQL 8.4.8I found this solution by starting to follow the steps of searching the repo and a comment in the repo .After a little research found that someone has a collection of rare formulars to brew up with.If your looking for MySQL 5.1.x, give this a try.Along the lines of @halfcube\'s suggestion, this works really well:Search for your package on braumeister.org.Look at the results. You\'ll be at a location like this:        http://braumeister.org/search/mysqlwhere mysql is your search query.Click the one you\'re interested in, e.g., "mysql", navigating to a location such as http://braumeister.org/formula/mysql.Look at the revision history at the bottom of the page.  If you\'re interested in MySQL 5.7.10, you might want to click the latest revision prior to 5.7.11, which navigates to a GitHub commit:https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commit/c77882756a832ac1d87e7396c114158e5619016c#Library/Formula/mysql.rbClick the "View" button to view the source for the mysql.rb file after the commit was applied.Then click the "Raw" button to view the raw source.Copy the URL.https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew/c77882756a832ac1d87e7396c114158e5619016c/Library/Formula/mysql.rbInstall it:Easy peasy.I just used Homebrew to go back to Maven 2.2.1 since the simple brew install maven installed Maven 3.0.3.First you have to leave the maven dir there so Use the brew tap commandNow you can install the maven2 formula:  Edit:\nYou can also just brew switch maven 2.2.1 to switch to a different version. Edit:\nThe Apache Maven project reorganized their repo.  Updated this answer to account for this change.Based on the workflow described by @tschundeee and @Debilski\xe2\x80\x99s update 1, I automated the procedure and added cleanup in this script.Download it, put it in your path and brewv <formula_name> <wanted_version>. For the specific OP, it would be::)On the newest version of homebrew (0.9.5 as of this writing) there will be a specific recipe for the version of the homebrew keg you want to install. Example:Then just do brew install mongodb26 like normal.In the case that you had already installed the latest version, make sure to unlink the latest version and link the desired version: brew unlink mongodb && brew link mongodb26.it could be done very easy for last version of brew.The problem with homebrew/versions is that someone has to have that specific version of software listed in the repository for you to be able to use it.  Also, since brew versions is no longer supported, another solution is required.  For solutions that indicate using brew switch, this will only work if you haven\'t done a brew cleanup since the version needs to exist on your computer.I had a problem with wanting to install a specific older version of docker-machine which wasn\'t listed in homebrew/versions.  I solved this using the below, which should also work for any brew installed software.  The example below will use docker-machine as the package I want to downgrade from version 0.5.0 to 0.4.1.Go to your homebrew Formula directory.\nYou can determine this by running brew info [any package name]. \nFor example, brew info docker-machine gives me a line that shows me\na path - /usr/local/Cellar/docker-machine/0.5.0.  This tells me that on my machine, homebrew is installed at /usr/localand my Formula\ndirectory is located by default at /usr/local/Library/FormulaLocate the specific formula file (.rb) for your package.\nSince I want to downgrade docker-machine, I can see a docker-machine.rb file.Get the version history for this formula file . \nEnter git log docker-machine.rb.  This will list out the complete commit history for this file.  You will see output like this:The tricky part is to find the latest commit for the specific version you want.  In the above, I can tell the latest 0.4.1 version was committed with this commit tag : commit 5970e1af9b13dcbeffd281ae57c9ab90316ba423.  The commits above this point start using version 0.5.0 (git log entries are listed from latest to earliest date).Get a previous version of the formula file.\nUsing the commit tag from step #3 (you can use the first 6 chars), you can get an older version of the formula file using the following:git checkout 5970e1 docker-machine.rbUninstall your current package version.\nJust run the normal brew commands to uninstall the current version of your package.\nEx. brew uninstall docker-machineInstall the older package version\nNow, you can just run the normal brew install command and it will install the formula that you have checkout out.\nEx. brew install docker-machineYou may need to re-link by using the brew link docker-machine if necessary.If at any time you want to revert back to the latest version of a specific package, go into the Formula directory and issue the following commands on your formula file (.rb)Then you can brew uninstall docker-machine and brew install docker-machine to get the latest version and keep it that way going forward.If you can\'t find your version with brew search <formula>, you can also try going over the commit logs for your formula to find the version you want: here is an example for installing an older version of nginx via brew:ngxnx formula commit logsee nginx: update 1.6.3 bottle eba75b9a1a474b9fc4df30bd0a32637fa31ec049From there, we can install 1.6.3 with the sha and raw git url:brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew/eba75b9a1a474b9fc4df30bd0a32637fa31ec049/Library/Formula/nginx.rbNone of these really worked for my case (Python), so I\'ll add my 2 cents:Output looks like this:I want version 2.7.11 so my hash is cf5da0547cd261f79d69e7ff62fdfbd2c2d646e9 (or cf5da05 for short).  Next, I check out that version and install the formula python:Finally, clean up:Update on the Library/Formula/postgresql.rb line 8 toAnd MD5 on line 9 toSave and exit.Now in this stage you might face the postgresql could not create shared memory segment error, to work around that update the  /etc/sysctl.conf like this:Try initdb /usr/local/var/postgres again, and it should run smooth.To run postgresql on startHope that helps :)I decided, against my better judgment, to create a formula for Maven 3.1.1, which homebrew/versions did not have. To do this:Yay.For versions not currently in the default brew formulas, you can easily create your own tap with the tool from https://github.com/buildtools-version-taps/homebrew-versions-tap-toolI just copied an older release of elasticsearch into the /usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch directory and ran brew switch elasticsearch 5.4.3That\'s it.\nMaybe it\'s useful for anyone.
