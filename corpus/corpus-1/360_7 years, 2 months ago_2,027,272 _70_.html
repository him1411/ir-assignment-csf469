How do I read every line of a file in Python and store each line as an element in a list? I want to read the file line by line and append each line to the end of the list.I\'m guessing that you meant list and not array.See Input and Ouput:or with stripping the newline character:Editor\'s note: This answer\'s original whitespace-stripping command, line.strip(), as implied by Janus Troelsen\'s comment, would remove all leading and trailing whitespace, not just the trailing \\n.This is more explicit than necessary, but does what you want.This will yield an "array" of lines from the file.If you want the \\n included:If you do not want \\n included:You could simply do the following, as has been suggested:Note that this approach has 2 downsides:1) You store all the lines in memory. In the general case, this is a very bad idea. The file could be very large, and you could run out of memory. Even if it\'s not large, it is simply a waste of memory.2) This does not allow processing of each line as you read them. So if you process your lines after this, it is not efficient (requires two passes rather than one).A better approach for the general case would be the following:Where you define your process function any way you want. For example:(The implementation of the Superman class is left as an exercise for you).This will work nicely for any file size and you go through your file in just 1 pass. This is typically how generic parsers will work.if you don\'t care about closing the file, this one-liner works:The traditional way:Using with (recommended):This should encapsulate the open command. Clean and Pythonic Way of Reading the Lines of a File Into a ListFirst and foremost, you should focus on opening your file and reading its contents in an efficient and pythonic way. Here is an example of the way I personally DO NOT prefer:Instead, I prefer the below method of opening files for both reading and writing as it\nis very clean, and does not require an extra step of closing the file\nonce you are done using it. In the statement below, we\'re opening the file\nfor reading, and assigning it to the variable \'infile.\'  Once the code within\nthis statement has finished running, the file will be automatically closed.Now we need to focus on bringing this data into a Python List because they are iterable, efficient, and flexible.  In your case, the desired goal is to bring each line of the text file into a separate element. To accomplish this, we will use the splitlines() method as follows:The Final Product:Testing Our Code:I\'d do it like this.Here\'s one more option by using list comprehensions on files;This should be more efficient way as the most of the work is done inside the Python interpreter.Another option is numpy.genfromtxt, for example:This will make data a NumPy array with as many rows as are in your file.If you\'d like to read a file from the command line or from stdin, you can also use the fileinput module:Pass files to it like so:Read more here: http://docs.python.org/2/library/fileinput.htmlThe simplest way to do itA simple way is to:In one line, that would give:Now variable out is a list (array) of what you want. You could either do:oryou\'ll get the same results.Just use the splitlines() functions. Here is an example.In the output you will have the list of lines.A real easy way:If you want to make it a fully-fledged program, type this in:For some reason, it doesn\'t read .py files properly.Data into list\nLet\'s read data from a text file  Save a file named "myfile.txt" whith the following content:line number one of the txt fileline number two of the txt fileline number three of the txt fileOpen the cmd in the same dir, run python and write:here I store the lines in a list (my_list)Now I get rid of the \\n characters at the end of each line with the strip() method of the class StringLet\'s print the list\'s itemsTo my knowledge Python doesn\'t have a native array data structure. But it does support the list data structure which is much simpler to use than an array.If you want to are faced with a very large / huge file and want to read faster (imagine you are in a Topcoder/Hackerrank coding competition), you might read a considerably bigger chunk of lines into a memory buffer at one time, rather than just iterate line by line at file level.Use this:data is a dataframe type, and uses values to get ndarray. You can also get a list by using array.tolist().You can just open your file for reading usingThe list lines will contain all your lines as individual elements and you can call a specific element using lines["linenumber-1"] as python starts its counting from 0.Could also use the loadtxt command in numpy. This checks for fewer conditions than genfromtxt so it may be faster. You can easily do it by the following piece of code:This should answer your question. The replace function will act as delimiter to strip the file."textFileLines" is the array you wantedHow about:Declare a Unix-like method:And just invoke it to get the file content.
