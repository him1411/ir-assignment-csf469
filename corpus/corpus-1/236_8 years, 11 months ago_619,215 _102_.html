I\'m taking my first crack at Ajax with jQuery. I\'m getting my data onto my page, but I\'m having some trouble with the JSON data that is returned for Date data types. Basically, I\'m getting a string back that looks like this:From someone totally new to JSON - How do I format this to a short date format? Should this be handled somewhere in the jQuery code? I\'ve tried the jQuery.UI.datepicker plugin using $.datepicker.formatDate() without any success.FYI: Here\'s the solution I came up with using a combination of the answers here:This solution got my object from the callback method and displayed the dates on the page properly using the date format library.Eval is not necessary. This will work fine:The substr function takes out the "/Date(" part, and the parseInt function gets the integer and ignores the ")/" at the end. The resulting number is passed into the Date constructor.EDIT: I have intentionally left out the radix (the 2nd argument to parseInt); see my comment below. Also, I completely agree with Rory\'s comment: ISO-8601 dates are preferred over this old format -- so this format generally shouldn\'t be used for new development. See the excellent Json.NET library for a great alternative that serializes dates using the ISO-8601 format.For ISO-8601 formatted JSON dates, just pass the string into the Date constructor:You can use this to get a date from JSON:And then you can use a JavaScript Date Format script (1.2 KB when minified and gzipped) to display it as you want.For those using Newtonsoft Json.NET, read up on how to do it via Native JSON in IE8, Firefox 3.5 plus Json.NET.Also the documentation on changing the format of dates written by Json.NET is useful:\nSerializing Dates with Json.NETFor those that are too lazy, here are the quick steps. As JSON has a loose DateTime implementation, you need to use the IsoDateTimeConverter(). Note that since Json.NET 4.5 the default date format is ISO so the code below isn\'t needed.The JSON will come through asFinally, some JavaScript to convert the ISO date to a JavaScript date:I used it like thisThe original example:  does not reflect the formatting used by WCF when sending dates via WCF REST using the built-in JSON serialization. (at least on .NET 3.5, SP1)I found the answer here helpful, but a slight edit to the regex is required, as it appears that the timezone GMT offset is being appended onto the number returned (since 1970) in WCF JSON.In a WCF service I have:ApptVisitLinkInfo is defined simply:When "Field2" is returned as Json from the service the value is:Notice the timezone offset included as part of the value.The modified regex:It\'s slightly more eager and grabs everything between the parens, not just the first number.  The resulting time sinze 1970, plus timezone offset can all be fed into the eval to get a date object.The resulting line of JavaScript for the replace is:  Answers to your post provide manual date conversion to JavaScript dates. I\'ve extended jQuery\'s $.parseJSON() just a little bit, so it\'s able to automatically parse dates when you instruct it to. It processes ASP.NET formatted dates (/Date(12348721342)/) as well as ISO formatted dates (2010-01-01T12.34.56.789Z) that are supported by native JSON functions in browsers (and libraries like json2.js).Anyway. If you don\'t want to repeat your date conversion code over and over again I suggest you read this blog post and get the code that will make your life a little easier.If you say in JavaScript,you will see that it\'s the correct date, and you can use that anywhere in JavaScript code with any framework.We have an internal UI library that has to cope with both Microsoft\'s ASP.NET built-in JSON format, like /Date(msecs)/, asked about here originally, and most JSON\'s date format including JSON.NET\'s, like 2014-06-22T00:00:00.0. In addition we need to cope with oldIE\'s inability to cope with anything but 3 decimal places.We first detect what kind of date we\'re consuming, parse it into a normal JavaScript Date object, then format that out.1) Detect Microsoft Date format2) Detect ISO date format3) Parse MS date format:4) Parse ISO date format.We do at least have a way to be sure that we\'re dealing with standard ISO dates or ISO dates modified to always have three millisecond places (see above), so the code is different depending on the environment.4a) Parse standard ISO Date format, cope with oldIE\'s issues:4b) Parse ISO format with a fixed three millisecond decimal places - much easier:5) Format it:6) Tie it all together:The below old answer is useful for tying this date formatting into jQuery\'s own JSON parsing so you get Date objects instead of strings, or if you\'re still stuck in jQuery <1.5 somehow.If you\'re using jQuery 1.4\'s Ajax function with ASP.NET MVC, you can turn all DateTime properties into Date objects with:In jQuery 1.5 you can avoid overriding the parseJSON method globally by using the converters option in the Ajax call.http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/Unfortunately you have to switch to the older eval route in order to get Dates to parse globally in-place - otherwise you need to convert them on a more case-by-case basis post-parse.I ended up adding the "characters into Panos\'s regular expression to get rid of the ones generated by the Microsoft serializer for when writing objects into an inline script:So if you have a property in your C# code-behind that\'s something likeAnd in your aspx you haveYou\'d get something likeNotice the double quotes.To get this into a form that eval will correctly deserialize, I used:I use Prototype and to use it I addedI also had to search for a solution to this problem and eventually I came across moment.js which is a nice library that can parse this date format and many more.It saved some headache for me so I thought I\'d share it with you. :)\nYou can find some more info about it here: http://momentjs.com/There is no built in date type in JSON. This looks like the number of seconds / milliseconds from some epoch. If you know the epoch you can create the date by adding on the right amount of time.In jQuery 1.5, as long as you have json2.js to cover for older browsers, you can deserialize all dates coming from Ajax as follows:I included logic that assumes you send all dates from the server as UTC (which you should); the consumer then gets a JavaScript Date object that has the proper ticks value to reflect this. That is, calling getUTCHours(), etc. on the date will return the same value as it did on the server, and calling getHours() will return the value in the user\'s local timezone as determined by their browser.This does not take into account WCF format with timezone offsets, though that would be relatively easy to add.Don\'t over-think this. Like we\'ve done for decades, pass a numeric offset from the de-facto standard epoch of 1 Jan 1970 midnight GMT/UTC/&c in number of seconds (or milliseconds) since this epoch. JavaScript likes it, Java likes it, C likes it, and the Internet likes it.Everyone of these answers has one thing in common: they all store dates as a single value (usually a string).Another option is to take advantage of the inherent structure of JSON, and represent a date as list of numbers:Of course, you would have to make sure both ends of the conversation agree on the format (year, month, day), and which fields are meant to be dates,... but it has the advantage of completely avoiding the issue of date-to-string conversion. It\'s all numbers -- no strings at all. Also, using the order: year, month, day also allows proper sorting by date.Just thinking outside the box here -- a JSON date doesn\'t have to be stored as a string.Another bonus to doing it this way is that you can easily (and efficiently) select all records for a given year or month by leveraging the way CouchDB handles queries on array values.Using the jQuery UI datepicker - really only makes sense if you\'re already including jQuery UI:output: October 15, 2008Posting in awesome thread:Is there another option without using the jQuery library?Just to add another approach here, the "ticks approach" that WCF takes is prone to problems with timezones if you\'re not extremely careful such as described here and in other places. So I\'m now using the ISO 8601 format that both .NET & JavaScript duly support that includes timezone offsets. Below are the details:In WCF/.NET:Where CreationDate is a System.DateTime; ToString("o") is using .NET\'s Round-trip format specifier that generates an ISO 8601-compliant date stringIn JavaScriptJust after retrieving the JSON I go fixup the dates to be JavaSript Date objects using the Date constructor which accepts an ISO 8601 date string...Once you have a JavaScript date you can use all the convenient and reliable Date methods like toDateString, toLocaleString, etc.Check up the date ISO standard; kind of like this:It becomes 2008.11.20T22:18.I get the date like this: In some examples the date is in slightly different formats:etc.So I came up with the following RegExp:and the final code is:Hope it helps.Update:\nI found this link from Microsoft:\nHow do I Serialize Dates with JSON?This seems like the one we are all looking for.This is frustrating. My solution was to parse out the "/ and /" from the value generated by ASP.NET\'s JavaScriptSerializer so that, though JSON may not have a date literal, it still gets interpreted by the browser as a date, which is what all I really want:{"myDate":Date(123456789)}Custom JavaScriptConverter for DateTime?I must emphasize the accuracy of Roy Tinker\'s comment. This is not legal JSON. It\'s a dirty, dirty hack on the server to remove the issue before it becomes a problem for JavaScript. It will choke a JSON parser. I used it for getting off the ground, but I do not use this any more. However, I still feel the best answer lies with changing how the server formats the date, for example, ISO as mentioned elsewhere.Below is a pretty simple solution for parsing JSON dates. Use the below functions as per your requirement. You just need to pass the JSON format Date fetched as a parameter to the functions below:A late post, but for those who searched this post.Imagine this:As you can see, I\'m utilizing C# 3.0\'s feature for creating the "Auto" Generics. It\'s a bit lazy, but I like it and it works. \nJust a note: Profile is a custom class I\'ve created for my web application project.Mootools solution:Requires mootools-more. Tested using  mootools-1.2.3.1-more on Firefox 3.6.3 and IE 7.0.5730.13Add the jQuery UI plugin in your page:FYI, for anyone using Python on the server side: datetime.datetime().ctime() returns a string that is natively parsable by "new Date()".  That is, if you create a new datetime.datetime instance (such as with datetime.datetime.now), the string can be included in the JSON string, and then that string can be passed as the first argument to the Date constructor.  I haven\'t yet found any exceptions, but I haven\'t tested it too rigorously, either.You also can use the JavaScript library moment.js, which comes in handy when you plan do deal with different localized formats and perform other operations with dates values:Setting up localization is as easy as adding configuration files (you get them at momentjs.com) to your project and configuring the language:What if .NET returns...And then in JavaScript...This may can also help you.
