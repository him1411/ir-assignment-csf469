I use this code to get the full URL:The problem is that I use some masks in my .htaccess, so what we see in the URL is not always the real path of the file.What I need is to get the URL, what is written in the URL, nothing more and nothing less\xe2\x80\x94the full URL.I need to get how it appears in the Navigation Bar in the web browser, and not the real path of the file on the server.Have a look at $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\'], i.e.(Note that the double quoted string syntax is perfectly correct)If you want to support both HTTP and HTTPS, you can useEditor\'s note: using this code has security implications. The client can set HTTP_HOST and REQUEST_URI to any arbitrary value it wants.Here are some more details about the issues and edge cases of the //example.com/path/ formatThis is a heavily modified version of http://snipplr.com/view.php?codeview&id=2734.scheme://username:password@domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_idThe parts in bold will not be included by the functionHTTP_HOST vs. SERVER_NAME\nIs Port Number Required in HTTP "Host" Header Parameter?\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/28049503/175071For that matter, just have a look at the whole array with print_r($_SERVER), you\'ll see everything you need there :)Example for URL: http://example.com/folder1/folder2/yourfile.php?var=blabla#12345Notice:hastag (#...) URL parts can\'t be detected from PHP (server-side). For that, use JavaScript.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR returns \\ for Windows-type hostings, instead of /*Here\'s a solution using a ternary statement, keeping the code minimal:This is the smallest and easiest way to do this, assuming one\'s web server is using the standard port 443 for HTTPS.My favorite cross platform method for finding the current URL is:Simply use:Note: I just made an update to "Timo Huovinen\'s" code, so you won\'t get any get\'s into the URL. This URL is plain and removes things like " ?hi=i&am=a&get ".Example:will be shown as:Unless you use Get\'s to define some specific content, then use his code! :-)Clear code, working in all webservers (Apache, nginx, IIS, ...):Here is my solution - code is inspired by Tracy Debugger. It was changed for support different server ports. You can get full current URL including $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\'] or just the basic server URL. Check my function:Here is test code:I\'ve made this function to handle the URL:Same technique as the accepted answer, but with HTTPS support, and more readable:Use this one-liner to find the parent folder URL (if you have no access to http_build_url() that comes along with pecl_http):I\'ve made this class to handle my URI\'sOf course you have to adapt it to your needs and system !?!It still needs to be perfected but it\'s a god solution for a centralized URI system :DThis is quite easy to do with your Apache environment variables. This only works with Apache 2, which I assume you are using.Simply use the following PHP code:You can use http_build_url with no arguments to get the full URL of the current page:This is the solution for your problem:I used this statement.I hope this will help you.Try this:$_SERVER is an array containing information such as headers, paths, and script locations. The entries in this array are created by the web server. There is no guarantee that every web server will provide any of these; servers may omit some, or provide others not listed here. That said, a large number of these variables are accounted for in the \xc2\xbb CGI/1.1 specification, so you should be able to expect those.$HTTP_SERVER_VARS contains the same initial information, but is not a superglobal. (Note that $HTTP_SERVER_VARS and $_SERVER are different variables and that PHP handles them as such) Try this:resource:\n  http://blog.lavoie.sl/2013/02/php-document-root-path-and-url-detection.htmlI think this method is good..try itThis works for both HTTP and HTTPS.Output something like this.https://example.com/user.php?token=3f0d9sickc0flmg8hnsngk5u07&access_level=applicationHTTP_ORIGIN can be usedI have used the below code, and it is working fine for me, for both cases, HTTP and HTTPS.Demo
