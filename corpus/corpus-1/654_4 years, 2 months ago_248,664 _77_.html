This morning I faced a problem while opening my Visual Studio solution, and when I tried to run it, it said:No exports were found that match the constraint contract nameHow can I fix this problem?I solved this problem by clearing Visual Studio Component Model Cache.Just delete or rename this folder: orand restart Visual Studio.The version of Visual Studio you have is specified by the number e.g.Visual Studio 2012 is 11.0 (as shown above)Visual Studio 2013 is 12.0Visual Studio 2015 is 14.0Visual Studio 2017 is 15.0For those that don\'t know: \n%LocalAppData%\\ is the same as C:\\Users\\{yourUsername}\\AppData\\LocalNo need to rename or delete the whole folder:  Just rename or delete the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Default.cache file inside the above location.Visual Studio Express 2012 has different paths.Visual Studio ExpressWith Visual Studio Express 2012 for WebI did not have to re-install Visual Studio ExpressDeleting the Component Model Cache did not work for me (well the relative directory given above did not exist in my machine). What did was installing an extension to VS 2012 Express. Tools > Extensions and Updates... > Online >  Choose any then download. This apparently invalidates the cache causing VS to rebuild it.Here\'s my source.This issue can be resolved by deleting or clearing all the folders and files from %AppData%\\..\\Local\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\11.0\\ComponentModelCacheThis actually clears visual studio component model cache.In windows 7 machines, path is different. When you type %appdata% n RUN command it opens the folder C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roamingclick \'up\' button to navigate to parent folder and select the folder \'Local\'final path : C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\11.0\\ComponentModelCacheThanks to @Simon B.Robert For VS2013 you need to remove that folder from this path %AppData%..\\Local\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\12.0for Visual Studio 2012 and later versions, the solution must be deleting the content of the folder ComponentModelCache:Visual Studio 2013I had the same problem upon launching VS 2013 Ultimate. The solutions here didn\'t work for me. I tried deleting the mentioned folders and starting VS again but it didn\'t work.However I had other problems too, like this Microsoft.visual studio package did not load correctly and also this Page '312e8a59-2712-48a1-863e-0ef4e67961fc' not found VS 2012. The later refers to a message in the Team Explorer window saying "Page \'somenumber\' cannot be found". So I run devenv /setup on the VS Command Prompt with administrative rights. It did the job and everything is fine now.Remove ComponentModelCache folder content.Clearing the folders didn\'t work for me. So I went to \'Programs and Features\' and used the change button to startup the Visual Studio 2013 setup.In the setup I choose the repair function and that fixed the problem for me.I had the same problem with Visual Studio Express 2013 of Windows 8.1.Unfortunatly there was no "ComponentModelCache" folder in \n%AppData%..\\Local\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\12.0\\ComponentModelCache.I found the "ComponentModelCache" folder in \n..\\Users[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WDExpress\\12.0and solved this problem by removing this folder from there.This will really work like a champ :Solution: Try to delete ComponentModelCache folder from below location.[C:]\\Users[your user name]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio[vs version number]And after successful delete recreate the folder with same name "ComponentModelCache".If you have VS 2013, you have to go to: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\12.0\nthen rename the ComponentModelCache folder.I experienced a similar problem after some updates released from Microsoft (part of them where about .net framework 4.5).On internet I got the following link to Microsoft KB:Update for Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 (KB2781514)It worked for meRenaming the ComponentModelCache folder worked for me in Visual Studio 2015, but with a slightly different path:I have Windows 7 x64 with a second partition on which Windows 8 (preview installed). While working with Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Phone, I come up with the same problem. But the ComponentModelCache is found here:C:\\Users\\Jayaram\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\VPDExpress\\11.0  I am unable to delete or rename as I get the "access is denied" message when I try to use command prompt:Administrator: VS2012 X64 CrossToolsCommandPromptThis happened to me with Visual Studio 2013 Web, after Windows installed several updates. Unfortunately none of the suggestions in this thread helped.I had to re-run the installer and select the "Repair" option. After that (and a reboot) it was working once again.i am using VS2012. After installing the VS2013 web express, when i want to run or open any project in VS2012 it shown me the following error : "no exports were found that match the constraint contract name" . I also try the above solution for clear the ComponentModelCache\nbut i do not find out the folder. i solve my problem just: Repair the VS2012 Edit: For the Express versions of the software the folder you need is in a slightly different place(s): For Express 2012 for Web it is C:\\Users\\XXXXXXXX\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\VWDExpress - not in the visual Studio folder.This issue is because of a MEF cache corruption. \nInstalling the feedback extension (or installing any extension) will invalidate the cache causing VS to rebuild it.click for source.i experienced this problem in Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for windows phone while trying to open file. Then i browsed toC:\\Users\\MyUserName\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\VPDExpress\\11.0\\ComponentModelCacheAnd Inside ComponentModelCache i deleted Microsoft.VisualStudio.Default.cache CACHE file. Finaly i restarted visual studio and reopened my project.Then my problem was solved, i was able to open file.Note: My OS is windows 8. And i installed SDK 8 for developing windows phone appThanksI had to uninstall some external components like Postsharp and Apex and then it worked. I also tried the chosen solution but it gave me more errors.Deleting the folders haven\'t worked for me i have go control panel and repaired And it worked for meI got this error after reinstall intellij resharper c# in visual studio 13. \nFirstly I got error problem with extensions, and after this I got this error:"No exports were found that match the constraint contract name\xe2\x80\x9dSimply removed folder ComponentModelCache and resolved this error.I got an error with the same error message - 2 years later.\nIt\'s a different problem this time though, related to .net core dnx things.I couldn\'t find an answer on stackoverflow, but in a github issue it contains a workaround: https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/1455Below the most important part of the workaround:Thanks to olegburov\'s post on github for figuring this out.
