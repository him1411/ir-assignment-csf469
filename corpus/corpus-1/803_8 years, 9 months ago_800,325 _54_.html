How do I connect to a MySQL database using a python program?1 - SettingYou must install a MySQL driver before doing anything. Unlike PHP, only the SQLite driver is installed by default with Python. The most used package to do so is MySQLdb but it\'s hard to install it using easy_install.For Windows user, you can get an exe of MySQLdb. For Linux, this is a casual package (python-mysqldb). (You can use sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb (for debian based distros), yum install MySQL-python (for rpm-based), or dnf install python-mysql (for modern fedora distro) in command line to download.)For Mac, you can install MySQLdb using Macport.2 - UsageAfter installing, reboot. This is not mandatory, but will prevent me from answering 3 or 4 other questions in this post if something goes wrong. So please reboot.Then it is just like using another package :Of course, there are thousand of possibilities and options; this is a very basic example. You will have to look at the documentation. A good starting point.3 - More advanced usageOnce you know how it works, you may want to use an ORM to avoid writting SQL manually and manipulate your tables as they were Python objects. The most famous ORM in the Python community is SQLAlchemy. I strongly advise you to use it: your life is going to be much easier.I recently discovered another jewel in the Python world: peewee. It\'s a very lite ORM, really easy and fast to setup then use. It makes my day for small projects or stand alone apps, where using big tools like SQLAlchemy or Django is overkill :This example works out of the box. Nothing other than having peewee (pip install peewee) is required.Here\'s one way to do it:Reference hereOracle (MySQL) now supports a pure Python connector.  That means no binaries to install: it\'s just a Python library.  It\'s called "Connector/Python".  http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/If you do not need MySQLdb, but would accept any library, I would very, very much recommend MySQL Connector/Python from MySQL: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/.It is one package (around 110k), pure Python, so it is system independent, and dead simple to install. You just download, double-click, confirm license agreement and go. There is no need for Xcode, MacPorts, compiling, restarting \xe2\x80\xa6Then you connect like:Stop Using MySQLDb if you want to avoid installing mysql headers just to access mysql from python.Use pymysql. It does all of what MySQLDb does, but it was implemented purely in Python with NO External Dependencies.  This makes the installation process on all operating systems consistent and easy.  pymysql is a drop in replacement for MySQLDb and IMHO there is no reason to ever use MySQLDb for anything... EVER! - PTSD from installing MySQLDb on Mac OSX and *Nix systems, but that\'s just me.Installationpip install pymysqlThat\'s it... you are ready to play.Example usage from pymysql Github repoALSO - Replace MySQLdb in existing code quickly and transparentlyIf you have existing code that uses MySQLdb, you can easily replace it with pymysql using this simple process:All subsequent references to MySQLdb will use pymysql transparently.As a db driver, there is also oursql. Some of the reasons listed on that link, which say why oursql is better:Very similar to mysqldb:The tutorial in the documentation is pretty decent.And of course for ORM SQLAlchemy is a good choice, as already mentioned in the other answers.Try using MySQLdbThere is a how to page here: http://www.kitebird.com/articles/pydbapi.htmlFrom the page:Despite all answers above, in case you do not want to connect to a specific database upfront, for example, if you want to create the database still (!), you can use connection.select_db(database), as demonstrated in the following.MySQLdb is the straightforward way. You get to execute SQL queries over a connection. Period.My preferred way, which is also pythonic, is to use the mighty SQLAlchemy instead. Here is a query related tutorial, and here is a tutorial on ORM capabilities of SQLALchemy.Just a modification in above answer. \nSimply run this command to install mysql for pythonremember! It is case sensitive.Also take a look at Storm. It is a simple SQL mapping tool which allows you to easily edit and create SQL entries without writing the queries.Here is a simple example:To find and object use:Find with primary key:For further information see the tutorial.For python 3.3CyMySQL\nhttps://github.com/nakagami/CyMySQLI have pip installed on my windows 7, just \npip install cymysql(you don\'t need cython)\nquick and painlessfirst install the driverThen a basic code goes like this:
