I used git pull and had a merge conflict. I know that the other version of the file is good and that mine is bad so all my changes should be abandoned. How do I do this?Since your pull was unsuccessful then HEAD (not HEAD^) is the last "valid" commit on your branch:The other piece you want is to let their changes over-ride your changes.  Older versions of git allowed you to use the "theirs" merge strategy:But this has since been removed, as explained in this message by Junio Hamano (the Git maintainer).  As noted in the link, instead you would do this:If your git version is >= 1.6.1, you can use git reset --merge.Also, as @Michael Johnson mentions, if your git version is >= 1.7.4, you can also use git merge --abort.As always, make sure you have no uncommitted changes before you start a merge.From the git merge man pagegit merge --abort is equivalent to git reset --merge when MERGE_HEAD is present.MERGE_HEAD is present when a merge is in progress.Also, regarding uncommitted changes when starting a merge:If you have changes you don\'t want to commit before starting a merge, just git stash them  before the merge and git stash pop after finishing the merge or aborting it.Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to reconstruct\n  the pre-merge state.If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge\n  started, git merge --abort will in some cases be unable to\n  reconstruct these changes. It is therefore recommended to always\n  commit or stash your changes before running git merge.git merge --abort is equivalent to git reset --merge when\n  MERGE_HEAD is present.http://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-mergeIn this particular use case, you don\'t really want to abort the merge, just resolve the conflict in a particular way.There is no particular need to reset and perform a merge with a different strategy, either. The conflicts have been correctly highlighted by git and the requirement to accept the other sides changes is only for this one file.For an unmerged file in a conflict git makes available the common base, local and remote versions of the file in the index. (This is where they are read from for use in a 3-way diff tool by git mergetool.) You can use git show to view them.The simplest way to resolve the conflict to use the remote version verbatim is:Or, with git >= 1.6.1:I think it\'s git reset you need.Beware that git revert means something very different to, say, svn revert - in Subversion the revert will discard your (uncommitted) changes, returning the file to the current version from the repository, whereas git revert "undoes" a commit.git reset should do the equivalent of svn revert, that is, discard your unwanted changes.Since comments suggest that git reset --merge is an alias for git merge --abort, it is worth noticing that git merge --abort is only equivalent to git reset --merge given that a MERGE_HEAD is present. This can be read in the git help for merge command.After a failed merge, when there is no MERGE_HEAD, the failed merge can be undone with git reset --merge but not necessarily with git merge --abort, so they are not only old and new syntax for the same thing.Personally I find git reset --merge much more powerful for scenarios similar to the described one, and failed merges in general.Since Git 1.6.1.3 git checkout has been able to checkout from either side of a merge:An alternative, which preserves the state of the working copy is:I generally advise against this, because it is effectively like merging in Subversion as it throws away the branch relationships in the following commit.
