I have Windows 7 32-bit. I installed the latest Node.js 32 bit. When I try to run the command npm install jquery, I receive the error:Error: ENOENT, stat \'C:\\Users\\RT\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm How does one resolve it?Manually creating a folder named \'npm\' in the displayed path fixed the problem.More information can be found on Troubleshooting pageI ran into the same problem while installing a package via npm. After creating the npm folder manually in C:\\Users\\UserName\\AppData\\Roaming\\ that particular error was gone, but it gave similar multiple errors as it tried to create additional directories in the npm folder and failed. The issue was resolved after running the command prompt as an administrator.This can also be fixed by installing a node package manually.The process of doing that will setup all the required directories.I recommend setting an alternative location for your npm modules.Of course you can set the location to wherever best suits.This has worked well for me and gets around any permissions issues that you may encounter.You can go to the Start Menu and search the Node.js icon and open the shell and then install anything withInstall a stable version instead of the latest one, I have downgrade my version to node-v0.10.29-x86.msi from \'node-v0.10.33-x86.msi\' and it is working well for me! http://blog.nodejs.org/2014/06/16/node-v0-10-29-stable/I needed a package from github that was written in typscript.  I did a git pull of the most recent version from the master branch into the root of my main project.  I then went into the directory and did an npm install so that the gulp commands would work that generates ES5 modules. Anyway, to make the long story short, my build process was trying to build files from this new folder so I had to move it out of my root.  This was causing these same errors.
