This question already has an answer here:Git clone will behave copying remote current working branch into local. Is there any way to clone a specific branch by myself without switching branches on remote repository?But If I Remember Correctly, by default, clone fetches all branches from remote, not current working branch.Example:Alternative (no public key setup needed):With Git 1.7.10 and later, add --single-branch to prevent fetching of all branches. Example, with OpenCV 2.4 branch:To clone a branch without fetching other branches:Here is a really simple way to do it :)Clone the repositoryList all branchesCheckout the branch that you wantfor example in my case:So to create a new branch based on my enum-account-number branch I do:After you hit return the following happens:"Create a branch on the local system with that name. e.g. say you want to get the branch named "branch-05142011"git branch branch-05142011 origin/branch-05142011 It\'ll give you a message like - "Branch branch-05142011 set up to track remote branch branch-05142011 from origin."  Now just checkout the branch like below and you have the code -\ngit checkout branch-05142011But bash completion don\'t get this key: --branchEnjoy.
