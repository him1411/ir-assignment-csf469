Is there a function that will trim not only spaces for whitespace, but also tabs?Whitespace on both sides:Whitespace on the right side:Whitespace on the left side:As thedz points out, you can provide an argument to strip arbitrary characters to any of these functions like this:This will strip any space, \\t, \\n, or \\r characters from the left-hand side, right-hand side, or both sides of the string. The examples above only remove strings from the left-hand and right-hand sides of strings. If you want to also remove characters from the middle of a string, try re.sub:That should print out:Python trim method is called strip:For leading and trailing whitespace:Otherwise, a regular expression works:You can also use very simple, and basic function: str.replace(), works with the whitespaces and tabs:Simple and easy.No one has posted these regex solutions yet.Matching:Searching (you have to handle the "only spaces" input case differently):If you use re.sub, you may remove inner whitespace, which could be undesirable.Whitespace includes space, tabs and CRLF. So an elegant and one-liner string function we can use is translate. \' hello  apple\'.translate(None, \' \\n\\t\\r\')OR if you want to be thoroughoutput:\n  please_remove_all_whitespacestry translateGenerally, I am using the following method:Note: This is only for removing "\\n", "\\r" and "\\t" only. It does not remove extra spaces.This will remove all whitespace and newlines from both the beginning and end of a string:To remove \\n, \\r, \\t, the better way is:Output:This is the easiest way to remove the above characters.\nIf any python package or library is available, then please let me know and also suggest how to remove character/??, occurs due to pressing Enter.
