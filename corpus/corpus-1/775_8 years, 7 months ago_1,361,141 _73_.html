Say I have the following CSS and HTML code:The header section is fixed height, but the header content may change.\nI would like to content of the header to be vertically aligned to the bottom of the header section, so the last line of text "sticks" to the bottom of the header section.So if there is only one line of text it would be like:And if there were three lines:How can this be done in CSS?Relative+absolute positioning is your best bet:But you may run into issues with that.  When I tried it I had problems with dropdown menus appearing below the content.  It\'s just not pretty.Honestly, for vertical centering issues and, well, any vertical alignment issues with the items aren\'t fixed height, it\'s easier just to use tables.Example: Can you do this HTML layout without using tables?Use CSS positioning.As cletus noted, you need identify the header-content to make this work.I use these properties and it works!After struggling with this same issue for some time, I finally figured out a solution that meets all of my requirements:The solution just takes one <div>, which I call the "aligner":CSShtmlThis trick works by creating a tall, skinny div, which pushes the text baseline to the bottom of the container.Here is a complete example that achieves what the OP was asking for.  I\'ve made the "bottom_aligner" thick and red for demonstration purposes only.CSS:HTML:If you\'re not worried about legacy browsers use a flexbox.The parent element needs its display type set to flexThen you set the child element\'s align-self to flex-end.Here\'s the resource I used to learn:\nhttp://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/Inline or inline-block elements can be aligned to the bottom of block level elements if the line-height of the parent/block element is greater than that of the inline element.*markup:css:*make sure you\'re in standards modeThe modern way to do it would be using flexbox. See the example below. You don\'t even need to wrap Some text... into any HTML tag, since text directly contained in a flex container is wrapped in an anonymous flex item.If there is only some text and you want to align vertically to the bottom of the container.If you have multiple, dynamic height items, use the CSS display values of table and table-cell:HTMLCSSI\'ve created a JSBin demo here: http://jsbin.com/INOnAkuF/2/editThe demo also has an example how to vertically center align using the same technique.Here\'s the flexy way to do it. Of course, it\'s not supported by IE8, as the user needed 7 years ago. Depending on what you need to support, some of these can be done away with.Still, it would be nice if there was a way to do this without an outer container, just have the text align itself within it\'s own self.I know this is over 2 years old, but I have devised a way which is a lot simpler than whats been mentioned.Set the height of the header div. Then inside that, style your H1 tag as follows:I\'m working on a site for a client, and the design requires the text to be at the bottom of a certain div. I\'ve achieved the result using these two lines and it works fine. Also, if the text does expand, the padding will still remain the same.if you could set the height of the wrapping div of the content (#header-content as shown in other\'s reply), instead of the entire #header, maybe you can also try this approach:HTMLCSSshow on codepenYou don\'t need absolute+relative for this. It is very much possible using relative position for both container and data. This is how you do it.Assume height of your data is going to be x. Your container is relative and footer is also relative. All you have to do is add to your dataYour data will always be at the bottom of your container. Works even if you have container with dynamic height.HTML will be like thisCSS will be like thisLive example hereHope this helps. try with:try changing the % to fix it. Example: 120% or 90% ...etc.The site I just did for a client requested that the footer text was a high box, with the text at the bottom I achieved this with simple padding, should work for all browsers.A perfect cross-browser example is probably this one here:http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/213/213.css&page=0The idea is both to display the div at the bottom and also making it stick there. Often the simple approach will make the sticky div scroll up with the main content.Following is a fully working minimal example. Note that there\'s no div embedding trickery required. The many BRs are just to force a scrollbar to appear:If you are wondering your code might not be working on IE, remember to add the DOCTYPE tag at the top. It\'s crucial for this to work on IE. Also, this should be the first tag and nothing should appear above it.Seems to be working:HTML:\n    I\'m at the bottomcss:I found this solution bassed on a default bootstrap start templateSeems to be working:Using less makes solving CSS puzzles much more like coding than like... I just love CSS. It\'s a real pleasure when you can change the whole layout (without breaking it :) just by changing one parameter.2015 solutionhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/qERMdxyour welcome
