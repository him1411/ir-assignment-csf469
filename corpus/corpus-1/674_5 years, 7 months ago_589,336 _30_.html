I had a problem with my mac where I couldn\'t save any kind of file on the disk anymore.\nI had to reboot OSX lion and reset the permissions on files and acls.But now when I want to commit a repository I get the following error from ssh:What permissions levels should i give to the id_rsa file?Keys need to be only readable by you:edit: 600 appears to be fine as well (in fact better in most cases, because you don\'t need to change file permissions to edit it).edit again:\nThe relevant portion from the manpage (man ssh)Using Cygwin in Windows 8.1, there is a command need to be run:chgrp Users ~/.ssh/id_rsaThen the solution posted here can be applied, 400 or 600 is OK.chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsaRef: http://vineetgupta.com/blog/cygwin-permissions-bug-on-windows-8The locale-independent solution that works on Windows 8.1 is:GID 545 is a special ID that always refers to the \'Users\' group, even if you locale uses a different word for Users.0600 is what mine is set at (and it\'s working)AFAIK the values are:700  for the hidden directory ".ssh" where key file is located600  for the keyfile "id_rsa"There is one exception to the "0x00" permissions requirement on a key. If the key is owned by root and group-owned by a group with users in it, then it can be "0440" and any user in that group can use the key.I believe this will work with any permissions in the set "0xx0" but I haven\'t tested every combination with every version. I have tried 0660 with 5.3p1-84 on CentOS 6, and the group not the primary group of the user but a secondary group, and it works fine.This would typically not be done for someone\'s personal key, but for a key used for automation, in a situation where you don\'t want the application to be able to mess with the key.Similar rules apply to the .ssh directory restrictions.what worked for mechgrp Users FOLDERchmod 600 FOLDERIntersting message here.\nOperating Syatems are smart enough to deny remote connections if your private key is too open. It understands the risk where permissions for id_rsa is wide open (read, is edittable by anyone).{ One might have changed your lock first and then open it with the keys he already had. }cd ~/.ssh; chmod 400 id_rsaPS: While working on the multiple servers (non-production), most of us feel need to connect remote server with ssh. A good idea is to have a pice of application level code (may be java using jsch) to create ssh trusts between servers. This way connection will be passwordless. Incase, perl is installed - one may use net ssh module too.I am using VPC on EC2 and was getting the same error messages. I noticed I was using the public DNS. I changed that to the private DNS and vola!! it worked...
