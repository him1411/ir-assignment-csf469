What are the differences between .gitignore and .gitkeep? Are they the same thing with a different name, or do they both serve a different function? I don\'t seem to be able to find much documentation on .gitkeep.".gitkeep" isn\xe2\x80\x99t documented, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not a feature of Git.Git cannot add a completely empty directory. People who want to track empty directories in Git have created the convention of putting files called \xe2\x80\x9c.gitkeep\xe2\x80\x9d in these directories. The file could be called anything; Git assigns no special significance to this name.There is a competing convention of adding a \xe2\x80\x9c.gitignore\xe2\x80\x9d file to the empty directories to get them tracked, but some people see this as confusing since the goal is to keep the empty directories, not ignore them; \xe2\x80\x9c.gitignore\xe2\x80\x9d is also used to list files that should be ignored by Git when looking for untracked files..gitkeep is just a placeholder. A dummy file, so git will not forget about the directory, since git tracks only files.If you want an empty dir and make sure it stays \'clean\' for git, create a .gitignore containing the following lines within:If you desire to have only one type of files being visible to git, here is an example how to filter everything out, except .gitignore and all .txt files:(\'#\' indicates comments.)is a text file comprising a list of files in your directory that git will ignore or not add/update in the repository.Since git removes or doesn\'t add empty directories to a repo .gitkeep is sort of a hack (I don\'t think it\'s officially named as a part of git) to keep empty directories in the repo.just do a touch /path/to/emptydirectory/.gitkeep to add the file and git will now be able to maintain this directory in the repository.
