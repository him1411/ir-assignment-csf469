I have two radio buttons and want to post the value of the selected one.\nHow can I get the value with jQuery?I can get all of them like this:How do I know which one is selected?To get the value of the selected radioName item of a form with id myForm:Here\'s an example:Use this..  If you already have a reference to a radio button group, for example:Use the filter() function, not find(). (find() is for locating child/descendant elements, whereas filter() searches top-level elements in your selection.)Note: This answer was originally correcting another answer that recommended using find(), which seems to have since been changed. find() could still be useful in the situation where you already had a reference to a container element, but not to the radio buttons, e.g.:This should work: Note the "" usaged around the input:checked and not \'\' like the Peter J\'s solutionYou can use the :checked selector along with the radio selector.Get all radios:Filter to get the one thats checkedIf you want just the boolean value, i.e. if it\'s checked or not try this:Another option is:Here\'s how I would write the form and handle the getting of the checked radio.Using a form called myForm:Get the value from the form:If you\'re not posting the form, I would simplify it further by using:Then getting the checked value becomes:Having a class name on the input allows me to easily style the inputs...In a JSF generated radio button (using <h:selectOneRadio> tag), you can do this:where selectOneRadio ID is radiobutton_id and form ID is form_id.Be sure to use name instead id, as indicated, because jQuery uses this attribute (name is generated automatically by JSF resembling control ID).Also, check if the user does not select anything.If you have Multiple radio buttons in single form then This is working for me.In my case I have two radio buttons in one form and I wanted to know the status of each button.\nThis below worked for me:HTML side:Javascript side:I wrote a jQuery plugin for setting and getting radio-button values. It also respects the "change" event on them.Put the code anywhere to enable the addin. Then enjoy! It just overrides the default val function without breaking anything.You can visit this jsFiddle to try it in action, and see how it works.FiddleThis works fineWorking DemoThe :checked selector works for checkboxes, radio buttons, and select elements. For select elements only, use the :selected selector.API for :checked SelectorTo get the value of the selected radio that uses a class:Use this:I use this simple scriptIf you only have 1 set of radio buttons on 1 form, the jQuery code is as simple as this:I\'ve released a library to help with this.  Pulls all possible input values, actually, but also includes which radio button was checked.  You can check it out at https://github.com/mazondo/formalizedataIt\'ll give you a js object of the answers, so a form like:will give you:To retrieve all radio buttons values in JavaScript array use following jQuery code :try it-From this question, I came up with an alternate way to access the currently selected input when you\'re within a click event for its respective label. The reason why is because the newly selected input isn\'t updated until after its label\'s click event.TL;DRDEMO : https://jsfiddle.net/ipsjolly/xygr065w/HTMLsubmitJQueryWhat I needed to do was simplify C# code, that is do as much as possible in the front end JavaScript.  I\'m using a fieldset container because I\'m working in DNN and it has its own form.  So I can\'t add a form.I need to test which text box out of 3 is being used and if it is, what\'s the type of search? Starts with the value, Contains the value, Exact Match of the value.HTML:And my JavaScript is:Just saying any containing tag with an ID can be used.  For DNNers, this is good to know.  The end goal here is pass to the mid-level code what is needed to start a parts search in SQL Server.This way I don\'t have to copy the much more complicated previous C# code also.  The heavy lifting is being done right here.I had to look a bit for this and then tinker with it to get it to work.  So for other DNNers, hopefully this is easy to find.
