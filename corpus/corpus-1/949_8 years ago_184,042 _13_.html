How can I query git to find out which branches contain a given commit? gitk will usually list the branches, unless there are too many, in which case it just says "many (38)" or something like that. I need to know the full list, or at least whether certain branches contain the commit.From the git-branch manual page:Only list branches which contain the specified commit (HEAD if not specified). Implies --list.Lists remote tracking branches as well (as mentioned in user3941992\'s answer below) that is "local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch".See also this git ready article.The --contains tag will figure out if a certain commit has been brought in yet into your branch. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a commit SHA from a patch you thought you had applied, or you just want to check if commit for your favorite open source project that reduces memory usage by 75% is in yet.Note: if the commit is on a remote tracking branch, add the -a option.\n(as MichielB comments below)MatrixFrog comments that it only shows which branches contain that exact commit.\nIf you want to know which branches contain an "equivalent" commit (i.e. which branches have cherry-picked that commit) that\'s git cherry:Because git cherry compares the changeset rather than the commit id (sha1), you can use git cherry to find out if a commit you made locally has been applied <upstream> under a different commit id.\n  For example, this will happen if you\xe2\x80\x99re feeding patches <upstream> via email rather than pushing or pulling commits directly.(Here, the commits marked \'-\' wouldn\'t show up with git cherry, meaning they are already present in <upstream>.)You may run:From comment of last commit in the output you may find original branch nameExample:
