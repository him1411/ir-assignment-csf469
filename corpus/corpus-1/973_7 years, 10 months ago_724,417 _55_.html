I need to place a div (with position:absolute;) element in the center of my window. But I am having problems doing so, because the width is unknown.I tried this. But it needs to be adjusted as the width is responsive.Any ideas?This works for me:Here is a good solution for responsive design or unknown dimensions in general if you don\'t need to support IE8 and lower.Here is a JS FiddleThe clue is, that left: 50% is relative to the parent while the translate transform is relative to the elements width/height.This way you have a perfectly centered element, with a flexible width on both child and parent. Bonus: this works even if the child is bigger than the parent.You can also center it vertically with this (and again, width and height of parent and child can be totally flexible (and/or unknown)):Keep in mind that you might need transform vendor prefixed as well. For example -webkit-transform: translate(-50%,-50%);Really nice post..

Otherwise, you\'ll need Javascript to do that.I\'d like to add on to @bobince\'s answer:Improved:    /// this makes the horizontal scrollbar not appear with large elements in the centered div.Heres a useful jQuery plugin to do this. Found here. I don\'t think it\'s possible purely with CSSMy preferred centering method:JSFiddle heresass/compass version of Responsive Solution above:This worked for me :I know I already provided an answer, and my previous answer, along with others given, work just fine.
