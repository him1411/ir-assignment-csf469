I want to be able to do the following:Create a local branch based on some other (remote or local) branch (via git branch or git checkout -b)Push the local branch\nto the remote repository (publish), but make it\ntrackable so git pull and git push will work immediately.How do I do that?I know about --set-upstream in Git 1.7, but that is a post-creation action. I want to find a way to make a similar change when pushing the branch to the remote repository.In Git 1.7.0 and later, you can checkout a new branch:Edit files, add and commit. Then push with the -u option:Git will set up the tracking information during the push.This will push all your branches to the remote, and --set-upstream tracking correctly for you:(Not exactly what the OP was asking for, but this one-liner is pretty popular)Prior to the introduction of git push -u, there was no git push option to obtain what you desire. You had to add new configuration statements.If you create a new branch using:You can use the git config command to avoid editing directly the .git/config file.Or you can edit manually the .git/config file to had tracking information to this branch.Simply put, to create a new local branch, do:To push it to the remote repository, do:A slight variation of the solutions already given here:1) Create a local branch based on some other (remote or local) branch:2) Push the local branch to the remote repository (publish), but make it trackable so git pull and git push will work immediatelyUsing HEAD is a "handy way to push the current branch to the same name on the remote". Source: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push\nIn git terms, HEAD (in uppercase) is a reference to the top of the current branch (tree).The -u option is just short for --set-setupstream. This will add an upstream tracking reference for the current branch. you can verify this by looking in your .git/config file:I suppose that you have already cloned a project like:Then in your local copy, create a new branch and check it out:Supposing that you made a "git bare --init" on your server and created the myapp.git, you should:After that, users should be able toNOTE: I\'m assuming that you have your server up and running. If it isn\'t, it won\'t work. A good how-to is here.Add a remote branch:Check if everything is good (fetch origin and list remote branches):Create a local branch and track the remote branch:Update everything:edit Outdated, just use git push -u origin $BRANCHNAMEUse git publish-branch from William\'s miscellaneous Git tools (gitorious repo and clone).OK, no Ruby, so - ignoring the safeguards! - take the last three lines of the script and create a bash script, git-publish-branch:Then run git-publish-branch REMOTENAME BRANCHNAME, where REMOTENAME is usually origin (you may modify the script to take origin as default, etc...)To create a new branch by branching off from existing branchgit checkout -b <new_branch>and then push this new branch to repository usinggit push -u origin <new_branch>This creates and pushes all local commits to a newly created remote branch origin/<new_branch>I simply doover an already cloned project.git creates a new branch named remoteBranchToBeCreated under my commits I did in localBranch.I made an alias so that whenever I create a new branch, it will push and track the remote branch accordingly. I put following chunk into the .bash_profile file:Usage: just type gcb thuy/do-sth-kool with thuy/do-sth-kool is my new branch name.For GitLab version prior to 1.7, use:git checkout -b name_branch(name_branch, ex :master)To push it to the remote repository, do:git push -u origin name_new_branch(name_new_branch, example: feature)Building slightly upon the answers here, I\'ve wrapped this process up as a simple bash script, which could of course be used as a git alias as well. The important addition to me is that this prompts me to run unit tests before committing, and passes in the current branch name by default.To upload your local branch of a public repository, you need to cd to the public repository and then use the following code:
