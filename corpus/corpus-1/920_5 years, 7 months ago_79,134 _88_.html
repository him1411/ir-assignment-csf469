In countless places online I have seen the recommendation to include CSS prior to JavaScript. The reasoning is generally, of this form:When it comes to ordering your CSS and JavaScript, you want your CSS\n  to come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the\n  style information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript\n  includes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before\n  continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering\n  thread can\'t completely show the page, since it doesn\'t have all the\n  styles it needs.My actual testing reveals something quite different: I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources: The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example, http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500 gives me a 500 ms delay transferring the CSS. I use the following page to test.When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render: When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render: I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In Opera however, the ordering simply does not matter.What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time. Am I missing something, is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct? It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.This is a very interesting question.  I\'ve always put my CSS <link href="...">s before my JS <script src="...">s because "I read one time that it\'s better."  So, you\'re right; it\'s high time we do some actual research!I set up my own test harness in Node (code below).  Basically, I:First, with the CSS file delayed by 500ms:Next, I set jQuery to delay by 500ms instead of the CSS:Finally, I set both jQuery and the CSS to delay by 500ms:First, it\'s important to note that I\'m operating under the assumption that you have scripts located in the <head> of your document (as opposed to the end of the <body>).  There are various arguments regarding why you might link to your scripts in the <head> versus the end of the document, but that\'s outside the scope of this answer.  This is strictly about whether <script>s should go before <link>s in the <head>.In modern DESKTOP browsers, it looks like linking to CSS first never provides a performance gain.  Putting CSS after script gets you a trivial amount of gain when both CSS and script are delayed, but gives you large gains when CSS is delayed.  (Shown by the last columns in the first set of results.)Given that linking to CSS last does not seem to hurt performance but can provide gains under certain circumstances, you should link to external stylesheets after you link to external scripts only on desktop browsers if the performance of old browsers is not a concern.  Read on for the mobile situation.Historically, when a browser encountered a <script> tag pointing to an external resource, the browser would stop parsing the HTML, retrieve the script, execute it, then continue parsing the HTML.  In contrast, if the browser encountered a <link> for an external stylesheet, it would continue parsing the HTML while it fetched the CSS file (in parallel).Hence, the widely-repeated advice to put stylesheets first – they would download first, and the first script to download could be loaded in parallel.However, modern browsers (including all of the browsers I tested with above) have implemented speculative parsing, where the browser "looks ahead" in the HTML and begins downloading resources before scripts download and execute.In old browsers without speculative parsing, putting scripts first will affect performance since they will not download in parallel.Speculative parsing was first implemented in: (along with the percentage of worldwide desktop browser users using this version or greater as of Jan 2012)In total, roughly 85% of desktop browsers in use today support speculative loading.  Putting scripts before CSS will have a performance penalty on 15% of users globally; YMMV based on your site\'s specific audience.  (And remember that number is shrinking.)On mobile browsers, it\'s a little harder to get definitive numbers simply due to how heterogeneous the mobile browser and OS landscape is.  Since speculative rendering was implemented in WebKit 525 (released Mar 2008), and just about every worthwhile mobile browser is based on WebKit, we can conclude that "most" mobile browsers should support it.  According to quirksmode, iOS 2.2/Android 1.0 use WebKit 525.  I have no idea what Windows Phone looks like.However, I ran the test on my Android 4 device, and while I saw numbers similar to the desktop results, I hooked it up to the fantastic new remote debugger in Chrome for Android, and Network tab showed that the browser was actually waiting to download the CSS until the JavaScripts completely loaded – in other words, even the newest version of WebKit for Android does not appear to support speculative parsing.  I suspect it might be turned off due to the CPU, memory, and/or network constraints inherent to mobile devices.Forgive the sloppiness – this was Q&D.app.jscss.htmljs.htmltest.jsjquery.js was jquery-1.7.1.min.jsThere are two main reasons to put CSS before JavaScript.Old browsers (Internet Explorer 6-7, Firefox 2, etc.) would block all subsequent downloads when they started downloading a script. So if you have a.js followed by b.css they get downloaded sequentially: first a then b. If you have b.css followed by a.js they get downloaded in parallel so the page loads more quickly.Nothing is rendered until all stylesheets are downloaded - this is true in all browsers. Scripts are different - they block rendering of all DOM elements that are below the script tag in the page. If you put your scripts in the HEAD then it means the entire page is blocked from rendering until all stylesheets and all scripts are downloaded. While it makes sense to block all rendering for stylesheets (so you get the correct styling the first time and avoid the flash of unstyled content FOUC), it doesn\'t make sense to block rendering of the entire page for scripts. Often scripts don\'t affect any DOM elements or just a portion of DOM elements. It\'s best to load scripts as low in the page as possible, or even better load them asynchronously.It\'s fun to create examples with Cuzillion. For example, this page has a script in the HEAD so the entire page is blank until it\'s done downloading. However, if we move the script to the end of the BODY block the page header renders since those DOM elements occur above the SCRIPT tag, as you can see on this page.I would not emphasize too much on the results that you have got, I believe that it is subjective, but I have a reason to explain you that it is better to put in CSS before js.During the loading of your website, there are two scenarios that you would see:CASE 1:    white screen > unstyled website > styled website > interaction > styled and interactive website\nCASE 2:    white screen > unstyled website > interaction > styled website > styled and interactive website\n\nI honestly can\'t imagine anyone choosing Case 2. This would mean that visitors using slow internet connections will be faced with an unstyled website, that allows them to interact with it using Javascript (since that is already loaded). Furthermore, the amount of time spend looking at an unstyled website would be maximized this way. Why would anyone want that?It also works better as jQuery states "When using scripts that rely on the value of CSS style properties,\n  it\'s important to reference external stylesheets or embed style\n  elements before referencing the scripts".When the files are loaded in the wrong order (first JS, then CSS), any Javascript code relying on properties set in CSS files (for example the width or height of a div) won\'t be loaded correctly. It seems that with the wrong loading order, the correct properties are \'sometimes\' known to Javascript (perhaps this is caused by a race condition?). This effect seems bigger or smaller depending on the browser used.Were your tests performed on your personal computer, or on a web server? It is a blank page, or is it a complex online system with images, databases, etc.? Are your scripts performing a simple hover event action, or are they a core component to how your website renders and interacts with the user? There are several things to consider here, and the relevance of these recommendations almost always become rules when you venture into high-caliber web development.The purpose of the "put stylesheets at the top and scripts at the bottom" rule is that, in general, it\'s the best way to achieve optimal progressive rendering, which is critical to the user experience.All else aside: assuming your test is valid, and you really are producing results contrary to the popular rules, it\'d come as no surprise, really. Every website (and everything it takes to make the whole thing appear on a user\'s screen) is different and the Internet is constantly evolving. I include CSS files before Javascript for a different reason.If my Javascript needs to do dynamic sizing of some page element (for those corner cases where CSS is really a main in the back) then loading the CSS after the JS is russing can lead to race conditions, where the element is resized before CSS styles are applied and thus looks weird when the styles finally kick in. If I load the CSS beforehand I can guarantee that things run in the intended order and that the final layout is what I want it to be.Is the recommendation to include CSS before JavaScript invalid?Not if you treat it as simply a recommendation. But if your treat it as a hard and fast rule?, yes, it is invalid.From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/DOMContentLoadedStylesheet loads block script execution, so if you have a <script>\n  after a <link rel="stylesheet" ...> the page will not finish parsing\n  - and DOMContentLoaded will not fire - until the stylesheet is loaded.It appears that you need to know what each script relies on and make sure that execution of the script is delayed until after the right completion event. If the script relies only on the DOM, it can resume in ondomready/domcontentloaded, if it relies on images to be loaded or stylesheets to be applied, then if I read the above reference correctly, that code must be deferred until the onload event.I don\'t think that one sock size fits all, even though that is the way they are sold and I know that one shoe size does not fit all. I don\'t think that there is a definitive answer to which to load first, styles or script. It is more a case by case decision of what must be loaded in what order and what can be deferred until later as not being on the "critical path".To speak to the observer that commented that it is better to delay the users ability to interact until the sheet is pretty. There are many of you out there and you annoy your counterparts that feel the opposite. They came to a site to accomplish a purpose and delays to their ability to interact with a site while waiting for things that don\'t matter to finish loading are very frustrating.  I am not saying that you are wrong, only that you should be aware that there is another faction that exists that does not share your priority.This question particularly applies to all of the ads being placed on web sites. I would love it if site authors rendered just placeholder divs for the ad content and made sure that their site was loaded and interactive before injecting the ads in an onload event.  Even then I would like to see the ads loaded serially instead of all at once because they impact my ability to even scroll the site content while the bloated ads are loading. But that is just one persons point of view.I\'m not exactly sure how your testing \'render\' time as your using java script. However consider thisOne page on your site is 50k which is not unreasonable. The user is on the east coast while your server is on the west. MTU is definitely not 10k so there will be a few trips back and forth. It may take 1/2 a second to receive your page and stylesheets. Typically (for me) javascript (via jquery plugin and such) are much more than CSS. Theres also what happens when your internet connection chokes up midway on the page but lets ignore that (it happens to me occasionally and i believe the css renders but i am not 100% sure).Since css is in head there may be additional connections to get it which means it potentially can finish before the page does. Anyways during the type the remainder of the page takes and the javascript files (which is many more bytes) the page is unstyled which makes the site/connection appear slow.EVEN IF the JS interpreter refuses to start until the CSS is done the time taken to download the javascript code especially when far from the server is cutting into css time which will make the site look not pretty.Its a small optimization but thats the reason for it.Steve Souders has already given a definitive answer but...I wonder whether there\'s an issue with both Sam\'s original test and Josh\'s repeat of it.Both tests appear to have been performed on low latency connections where setting up the TCP connection will have a trivial cost.How this affects the result of the test I\'m not sure and I\'d want to look at the waterfalls for the tests over a \'normal\' latency connection but...The first file downloaded should get the connection used for the html page, and the second file downloaded will get the new connection. (Flushing the  early alters that dynamic, but it\'s not being done here)In newer browsers the second TCP connection is opened speculatively so the connection overhead is reduced / goes away, in older browsers this isn\'t true and the second connection will have the overhead of being opened.Quite how/if this affects the outcome of the tests I\'m not sure.It is suggested to include CSS file before JavaScript for one (or perhaps another) good reason:JavaScript blocks the browser from doing just about anything until it is downloaded, parsed and executed. Why? Because the JavaScript file might contain instructions such as document.write("<!--") which, when executed, change the markup of the page.If you put the CSS files before JavaScript files in your HTML source, things get better. Browser can load the two files (CSS and JavaScript) in parallel. Of course it would block while it attempts to download, parse and execute the JavaScript file but this period will then  be utilized to download other files in parallel.I think this wont be true for all the cases. Because css will download parallel but js cant. Consider for the same case,Instead of having single css, take 2 or 3 css files and try it out these ways,1) css..css..js\n2) css..js..css\n3) js..css..cssI\'m sure css..css..js will give better result than all others. Here is a SUMMARY of all the major answers above (or maybe below later :)For modern browsers, put css wherever you like it. They would analyze your html file (which they call speculative parsing) and start downloading css in parallel with html parsing. For old browsers keep putting css on top (if you don\'t want to show a naked but interactive page first).For all browsers, put javascript as farther down on the page as possible, since it will halt parsing of your html. Preferably, download it asynchronously (i.e., ajax call)There are also, some experimental results for a particular case which claims putting javascript first (as opposed to traditional wisdom of putting CSS first) gives better performance but there is no logical reasoning given for it, and lacks validation regarding widespread applicability, so you can ignore it for now. So, to answer the question: Yes. The recommendation to include the CSS before JS is invalid for the modern browsers. Put CSS wherever you like, and put JS towards the end, as possible. We have to keep in mind that new browsers have worked on their Javascript engines, their parsers and so on, optimizing common code and markup problems in a way that problems experienced in ancient browsers such as <=IE8 are no longer relevant, not only with regards to markup but also to use of JavaScript variables, element selectors etc. \nI can see in the not so distant future a situation where technology has reached a point where performance is not really an issue anymore.Personally, I would not place too much emphasis on such "folk wisdom."  What may have been true in the past might well not be true now.  I would assume that all of the operations relating to a web-page\'s interpretation and rendering are fully asynchronous ("fetching" something and "acting upon it" are two entirely different things that might be being handled by different threads, etc.), and in any case entirely beyond your control or your concern.I\'d put CSS references in the "head" portion of the document, along with any references to external scripts.  (Some scripts may demand to be placed in the body, and if so, oblige them.)Beyond that ... if you observe that "this seems to be faster/slower than that, on this/that browser," treat this observation as an interesting but irrelevant curiosity and don\'t let it influence your design decisions.  Too many things change too fast.  (Anyone want to lay any bets on how many minutes it will be before the Firefox team comes out with yet another interim-release of their product?  Yup, me neither.)
