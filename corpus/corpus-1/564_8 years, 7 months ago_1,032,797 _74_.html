The question is in the title.I\'d like to do in  python what I do in this example in c:Output:In Python:In Python print will add a \\n or a space, how can I avoid that? Now, it\'s just an example. Don\'t tell me I can first build a string then print it. I\'d like to know how to "append" strings to stdout.You may also need to callto ensure stdout is flushed immediately.From Python 2.6 you can import the print function from Python 3:This allows you to use the Python 3 solution below.In Python 3, the print statement has been changed into a function. In Python 3, you can instead do:This also works in Python 2, provided that you\'ve used from __future__ import print_function.If you are having trouble with buffering, you can flush the output by adding flush=True keyword argument:It should be as simple as described at this link by Guido Van Rossum:Re: How does one print without a c/r ?http://www.python.org/search/hypermail/python-1992/0115.htmlIs it possible to print something but not automatically have a\n  carriage return appended to it ?Yes, append a comma after the last argument to print. For instance,\nthis loop prints the numbers 0..9 on a line separated by spaces. Note\nthe parameterless "print" that adds the final newline:Note: The title of this question used to be something like "How to printf in python?"Since people may come here looking for it based on the title, Python also supports printf-style substitution:And, you can handily multiply string values:Use the python3-style print function for python2.6+   (will also break any existing keyworded print statements in the same file.)To not ruin all your python2 print keywords, create a separate printf.py fileThen, use it in your fileMore examples showing printf styleThis is not the answer to the question in the title, but it\'s the answer on how to print on the same line:The new (as of Python 3.0) print function has an optional end parameter that let\'s you modify the ending character. There\'s also sep for separator.You can just add , in the end of print function so it won\'t print on new line.Using functools.partial to create a new function called printfEasy way to wrap a function with default parameters.print function in python automatically generates a new line. You could try:print("Hello World", end="")You can do it with end argument of print. In python3 range() returns iterator and xrange() doesn\'t exist.You can try:you want to print something in for loop right;but you don\'t want it print in new line every time..\nfor example:but you want it to print like this:\nhi hi hi hi hi hi right????\njust add a comma after print "hi"Example:for i in range (0,5):\n   print "hi",\nOUTPUT:\nhi hi hi hi hi\npython 2.6+:python 3:python <= 2.5:if extra space is OK after each print, in python 2misleading in python 2 - avoid:i recently had the same problem..i solved it by doing:this works on both unix and windows ... have not tested it\non macosx ...hthIn Python 3, printing is a function. When you callPython translates it toYou can change end to whatever you want.Code for Python 3.6.1OutputYou can do the same in python3 as follows :and execute it with python filename.py or python3 filename.py@lenooh satisfied my query. I discovered this article while searching for \'python suppress newline\'. I\'m using IDLE3 on Raspberry Pi to develop Python 3.2 for PuTTY. I wanted to create a progress bar on the PuTTY command line. I didn\'t want the page scrolling away. I wanted a horizontal line to re-assure the user from freaking out that the program hasn\'t cruncxed to a halt nor been sent to lunch on a merry infinite loop - as a plea to \'leave me be, I\'m doing fine, but this may take some time.\' interactive message - like a progress bar in text.The print(\'Skimming for\', search_string, \'\\b! .001\', end=\'\') initializes the message by preparing for the next screen-write, which will print three backspaces as \xe2\x8c\xab\xe2\x8c\xab\xe2\x8c\xab rubout and then a period, wiping off \'001\' and extending the line of periods. After search_string parrots user input, the \\b! trims the exclamation point of my search_string text to back over the space which print() otherwise forces, properly placing the punctuation. That\'s followed by a space and the first \'dot\' of the \'progress bar\' which I\'m simulating. Unnecessarily, the message is also then primed with the page number (formatted to a length of three with leading zeros) to take notice from the user that progress is being processed and which will also reflect the count of periods we will later build out to the right.The progress bar meat is in the sys.stdout.write(\'\\b\\b\\b.\'+format(page, \'03\')) line. First, to erase to the left, it backs up the cursor over the three numeric characters with the \'\\b\\b\\b\' as \xe2\x8c\xab\xe2\x8c\xab\xe2\x8c\xab rubout and drops a new period to add to the progress bar length. Then it writes three digits of the page it has progressed to so far. Because sys.stdout.write() waits for a full buffer or the output channel to close, the sys.stdout.flush() forces the immediate write. sys.stdout.flush() is built into the end of print() which is bypassed with print(txt, end=\'\' ). Then the code loops through its mundane time intensive operations while it prints nothing more until it returns here to wipe three digits back, add a period and write three digits again, incremented.The three digits wiped and rewritten is by no means necessary - it\'s just a flourish which exemplifies sys.stdout.write() versus print(). You could just as easily prime with a period and forget the three fancy backslash-b \xe2\x8c\xab backspaces (of course not writing formatted page counts as well) by just printing the period bar longer by one each time through - without spaces or newlines using just the sys.stdout.write(\'.\'); sys.stdout.flush() pair.Please note that the Raspberry Pi IDLE3 Python shell does not honor the backspace as \xe2\x8c\xab rubout but instead prints a space, creating an apparent list of fractions instead.\xe2\x80\x94(o=8> wizMany of these answers seem a little complicated. In Python 3.X you simply do this,The default value of end is "\\n". We are simply changing it to a space or you can also use end="".This will work for you. here comma (,) is important after print.\nGot help from : http://freecodeszone.blogspot.in/2016/11/how-to-print-in-python-without-newline.htmlThis worked in both 2.7.8 & 2.5.2 (Canopy and OSX terminal, respectively) -- no module imports or time travel required.Here\'s a general way of printing without inserting a newline.Python 3In Python 3 it is very simple to implementYou will notice that all the above answers are correct. But I wanted to make a shortcut to always writing the " end=\'\' " parameter in the end.You could define a function likeIt would accept all the number of parameters. Even it will accept all the other parameters like file, flush ,etc and with the same name....you do not need to import any library. Just use the delete character:this removes the newline and the space (^_^)*Hello firstname lastname!\nwhile printing this\nif a is fist name and b is last name but while printing last name a space is finally added soMy understanding is that the comma suppressed the space\nThe 3 dots are relics of the interpreterfor i in range(0,10): print".\\n",\n      ... \n      .\n      .\n      .\n      .\n      .\n      .\n      .\n      .\n      .\n      .
