I\'m currently designing a kind of CSS \'mega dropdown\' menu - basically a normal CSS-only dropdown menu, but one that contains different types of content.At the moment, it appears that CSS3 Transitions don\'t apply to the \'display\' property, i.e. you can\'t do any sort of transition from display: none to display: block (or any combination).Can anyone think of a way for the second-tier menu from the above example to \'fade in\' when someone hovers over one of the top level menu items?I\'m aware that you can use transitions on the visibility: property, but I can\'t think of a way to utilise that effectively.I\'ve also tried using height but that just failed miserably.I\'m also aware that it\'s trivial to achieve this using JavaScript, but I wanted to challenge myself to use just CSS and I think I\'m coming up a little short.All and any suggestions most welcome.You can concatenate two transitions or more, and visibility is what comes handy this time.(Don\'t forget the vendor prefixes to the transition property)More details are in this articleYou need to hide the element by other means in order to get this to work. I accomplished the effect by positioning both <div>s absolutely and setting the hidden one to opacity: 0.If you even toggle the display property from none to block, Your transition on other elements will not occur.To work around this, always allow the element to be display: block, but hide the element by adjusting any of these means:There are likely more solutions, but you cannot perform a transition if you toggle the element to display: none. For example, you may attempt to try something like this:But that will not work. From my experience, I have found this to do nothing.Because of this, you will always need to keep the element display: block - but you could get around it by doing something like this:At the time of this post all major browsers disable CSS transitions if you try to change the display property, but CSS animations still work fine so we can use them as a work-around.Example Code:-   (You can apply it to your menu accordingly)  DemoAdd the following CSS to your stylesheet:-Then apply the fadeIn animation to the child on parent hover:- (and of course set display: block)I suspect that the reason that transitions are disabled if \xe2\x80\x9cdisplay\xe2\x80\x9d is changed is because of what display actually does. It does not change anything that could conceivably be smoothly animated.\xe2\x80\x9cdisplay: none;\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvisibility: hidden;\xe2\x80\x9d are two entirely different things. Both do have the effect of making the element invisible, but with \xe2\x80\x9cvisibility: hidden;\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s still rendered in the layout, but just not visibly so. The hidden element still takes up space, and is still rendered inline or as a block or block-inline or table or whatever the \xe2\x80\x9cdisplay\xe2\x80\x9d element tells it to render as, and takes up space accordingly. Other elements do not automatically move to occupy that space. The hidden element just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t render its actual pixels to the output.\xe2\x80\x9cdisplay: none\xe2\x80\x9d on the other hand actually prevents the element from rendering entirely. It does not take up any layout space. Other elements that would\xe2\x80\x99ve occupied some or all of the space taken up by this element now adjust to occupy that space, as if the element simply did not exist at all.\xe2\x80\x9cdisplay\xe2\x80\x9d is not just another visual attribute. It establishes the entire rendering mode of the element, such as whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a block, inline, inline-block, table, table-row, table-cell, list-item, or whatever! Each of those have very different layout ramifications, and there would be no reasonable way to animate or smoothly transition them (try to imagine a smooth transition from \xe2\x80\x9cblock\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinline\xe2\x80\x9d or vice-versa, for instance!).This is why transitions are disabled if display changes (even if the change is to or from \xe2\x80\x9cnone\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cnone\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t merely invisiblity, it\xe2\x80\x99s its own element rendering mode that means no rendering at all!), display is not one of the properties that transition works upon.See http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#animatable-properties- for the list of properties that can have transitions applied to them.I know this is a very old question but for people who are looking at this thread, you can add a custom animation to the block property now.DemoIn this demo the sub-menu changes from display:none to display:block and still manages to fade.According to W3C Working Draft 19 November 2013 display is not an animatable property. Fortunately, visibility is animatable. You may chain its transition with a transition of opacity (JSFiddle):HTML:CSS:JavaScript for testing:Note that if you just make the link transparent, without setting visibility: hidden, then it would stay clickable.My neat JavaScript trick is to separate the entire scenario into two different functions!To prepare things, one global variable is declared and one event handler is defined:Then, when hiding element, I use something like this: For reappearing the element, I am doing something like this:It works, so far!Edit: display none is not being applied in this example.What\'s happening above is that through 99% of the animation display is set to block while the opacity fades out. In the last moment display property is set to none.And the most important bit is to retain the last frame after the animation ends using animation-fill-mode: forwardsHere are two examples: https://jsfiddle.net/qwnz9tqg/3/I ran into this today, with a position: fixed modal that I was reusing. I couldn\'t keep it display: none and then animate it, as it just jumped into appearance, and and z-index (negative values, etc) did weird things as well.I was also using a height: 0 to height: 100%, but it only worked when the modal appeared. This is the same as if you used left: -100% or something.Then it struck me that there was a simple answer. Et voila:First, your hidden modal. Notice the height is 0, and check out the height declaration in transitions... it has a 500ms, which is longer than my opacity transition. Remember, this affects the out-going fade-out transition: returning the modal to its default state.Second, your visible modal. Say you\'re setting a .modal-active to the body. Now the height is 100%, and my transition has also changed. I want the height to be instantly changed, and the opacity to take 300ms.That\'s it, it works like a charm.Taking from a few of these answers and some suggestions elsewhere, the following works great for hover menus (I\'m using this with bootstrap 3, specifically):You could also use height in place of max-height if you specify both values since height:auto is not allowed with transitions. The hover value of max-height needs to be greater than the height of the menu can possibly be.Change overflow:hidden to overflow:visible. It works better. I use like this:visible is better because overflow:hidden act exactly like a display:none.No javascript required, and no outrageously huge max-height needed. Instead, set your max-height on your text elements, and use a font relative unit such as rem or em. This way, you can set a max height larger than your container, while avoiding a delay or "popping" when the menu closes:HTMLCSSSee an example here:\nhttp://codepen.io/mindfullsilence/pen/DtzjEI suspect anyone just starting CSS transitions quickly discovers that they don\'t work if you\'re modifying the display property (block/none) at the same time.  One work-around that hasn\'t yet been mentioned is that you can continue to use display:block/none to hide/show the element, but set its opacity to 0 so that even when it\'s display:block, it\'s still invisible.  Then to fade it in, add another CSS class such as "on" which sets the opacity to 1 and defines the transition for opacity. As you may have imagined, you\'ll have to use JavaScript to add that "on" class to the element, but at least you\'re still using CSS for the actual transition.P.S. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to do both display:block, and add class "on", at the same time, defer the latter using setTimeout.  Otherwise the browser just sees both things as happening at once and disables the transition.After the accepted answer from Guillermo was written the CSS\ntransition Spec of 3 April 2012 changed the behavior of the visibility transition\nand now it is possible to solve this problem in a shorter way, without the use of\ntransition-delay:The run time specified for both transitions should usually be\nidentical (although a slightly longer time for visibility is not a problem).\nFor a running version, see my blog\nhttp://www.taccgl.org/blog/css-transition-visibility.html#visibility-opacity.W.r.t. the title of the question "Transitions on the display: property" and\nin response to comments from Rui Marques and josh to the accepted answer:\nThis solution works in cases where it is irrelevant if the display or \nvisibility property is used (as it probably was the case in this question).\nIt will not completely remove the element as display:none, just make it \ninvisible but it still stays in the document flow and influences the position of the following elements.\nTransitions that completely remove the element similar to display:none can be done \nusing height (as indicated by other answers and comments), max-height, or margin-top/bottom, but also see \nHow can I transition height: 0; to height: auto; using CSS?\nand my blog http://www.taccgl.org/blog/css_transition_display.html.In response to comment from GeorgeMillo:\nBoth properties and both transitions are needed: The opacity property\nis used to create a fade-in and fade-out animation and the visibility\nproperty to avoid the element still reacting on mouse\nevents. Transitions are needed on opacity for the visual effect and on\nvisibility to delay hiding until the fade-out is finished.I think SalmanPK has the closest answer, it does fade an item in or out, with the following CSS animations. However the display property does not animate smoothly, only the opacity.If you want to animate the element moving from display block to display none, I can\'t see that it is currently possible just with CSS, you have to get the height and use a CSS animation to decrease the height. This is possible with CSS as shown in the example below, but it would be tricky to know the exact height values you need to animate for an element.jsFiddle exampleInstead of using display you could store the element \'off-screen\' until you needed it, then set its position to where you want it and transform it at the same time. This brings up a whole host of other design issues though, so ymmv. You probably wouldn\'t want to use display anyway, as you\'d want the content to be accessible to screen readers, which for the most part try to obey rules for visibility - i.e., if it shouldn\'t be visible to the eye, it won\'t show up as content to the agent.I feel almost bad answering to a question with that many answers, but this solution has excellent compatibility and I haven\'t seen it yet:Explanation: it uses the visibility: hidden trick (which is compatible with \xe2\x80\x9cshow-and-animate\xe2\x80\x9d in one step) but uses the combination position: absolute; z-index: -1; pointer-events: none; to make sure that the hidden container does not take space and does not answer to user interactions.I started an open source skeleton project called Toggle Display Animatehttps://marcnewton.github.io/Toggle-Display-Animate/This skeleton helper will allow you to easily mimic jQuery show/hide but with in/out CSS3 transition animations.It uses class toggles so you can use any css methods you want on elements besides display:none|block|table|inline etc as well as other alternate uses that can be thought up.Its main design purpose is for element toggle states, it supports a revert state where hiding the object allows you to run your keyframe in reverse or play an alternate animation for hiding the element.Most of the markup for the concept I am working on is CSS, there is very little javascript actually used.There is a demo here: http://marcnewton.co.uk/projects/toggle-display-animate/The simplest universal solution to the problem is: feel free to specify display:none in your CSS, however you will have change it to block (or whatever else) using JavaScript, and then you\'ll also have to add a class to your element in question that actually does the transition with setTimeout(). That\'s all.I.e.:Tested in the latest sane browsers. Obviously shouldn\'t work in IE9 or earlier.You can simply use css visibility: hidden/visible instead of display : none/blockyou can also use this:You can get this to work the natural way you expected - using display - but you have to throttle the browser to get it to work, using either JS or as others have suggested a fancy trick with one tag inside another. I don\'t care for the inner tag as it further complicates CSS and dimensions, so here\'s the JS solution:https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/1/Starting with a box like:A hidden box. You can have it transition on click with:The CSS is what you\'d guess:The key is throttling the display property. By removing the hidden class then waiting 50ms, then starting the transition via the added class, we get it to appear and then expand like we wanted, instead of it just blipping onto the screen without any animation. Similar occurs going the other way, except we wait till the animation is over before applying hidden.Note: I\'m abusing .animate(maxWidth) here to avoid setTimeout race conditions. setTimeout is quick to introduce hidden bugs when you or someone else picks up code unaware of it. .animate() can easily be killed with .stop(). I\'m just using it to put a 50ms or 2000ms delay on the standard fx queue where it\'s easy to find/resolve by other coders building on top of this.You can do this with transition events, so what you so is, you build 2 css classes for the transition, one holding the animation other, holding the display none state. and you switch them after the animation is ended? In my case i can display the divs again if i press a btn, and remove both classes.Try the snipped below...It can be handle by using transition timing functions step-end and step-startFor example: https://jsfiddle.net/y72h8Lky/I\'ve came across this issue multiple times and now simply went with:By adding the class block--invisible the whole Elements will not be clickable but all Elements behind it will be because of the pointer-events:none which is supported by all major browsers.There is a alternate solution with css animation for drop-down hidden:
