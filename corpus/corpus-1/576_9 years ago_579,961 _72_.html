How do I check if an object has a property in JavaScript?Consider:Is that the best way to do it?I\'m really confused by the answers that have been given - most of them are just outright incorrect. Of course you can have object properties that have undefined, null, or false values. So simply reducing the property check to typeof this[property] or, even worse, x.key will give you completely misleading results.It depends on what you\'re looking for. If you want to know if an object physically contains a property (and it is not coming from somewhere up on the prototype chain) then object.hasOwnProperty is the way to go. All modern browsers support it. (It was missing in older versions of Safari - 2.0.1 and older - but those versions of the browser are rarely used any more.)If what you\'re looking for is if an object has a property on it that is iterable (when you iterate over the properties of the object, it will appear) then doing: prop in object will give you your desired effect.Since using hasOwnProperty is probably what you want, and considering that you may want a fallback method, I present to you the following solution:The above is a working, cross-browser, solution to hasOwnProperty, with one caveat: It is unable to distinguish between cases where an identical property is on the prototype and on the instance - it just assumes that it\'s coming from the prototype. You could shift it to be more lenient or strict, based upon your situation, but at the very least this should be more helpful.With Underscore.js or (even better) lodash:Which calls Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty, but (a) is shorter to type, and (b) uses "a safe reference to hasOwnProperty" (i.e. it works even if hasOwnProperty is overwritten).In particular, lodash defines _.has as:Note: the following is nowadays largely obsolete thanks to strict mode, and hasOwnProperty. The correct solution is to use strict mode and to check for the presence of a property using obj.hasOwnProperty. This answer predates both these things, at least as widely implemented (yes, it is that old). Take the following as a historical note.Bear in mind that undefined is (unfortunately) not a reserved word in JavaScript if you\xe2\x80\x99re not using strict mode. Therefore, someone (someone else, obviously) could have the grand idea of redefining it, breaking your code.A more robust method is therefore the following:On the flip side, this method is much more verbose and also slower. :-/A common alternative is to ensure that undefined is actually undefined, e.g. by putting the code into a function which accepts an additional parameter, called undefined, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t passed a value. To ensure that it\xe2\x80\x99s not passed a value, you could just call it yourself immediately, e.g.:What about?Armin Ronacher seems to have already beat me to it, but:A safer, but slower solution, as pointed out by Konrad Rudolph and Armin Ronacher would be:You can use the in operator to check if the property exists on an object:You can also loop through all the properties of the object using a for - in loop, and then check for the specific property:You must consider if this object property is enumerable or not, because non-enumerable properties will not show up in a for-in loop. Also, if the enumerable property is shadowing a non-enumerable property of the prototype, it will not show up in Internet Explorer 8 and earlier.If you\xe2\x80\x99d like a list of all instance properties, whether enumerable or not, you can useThis will return an array of names of all properties that exist on an object.Finally, you can use the typeof operator to directly check the data type of the object property:If the property does not exist on the object, it will return the string undefined. Else it will return the appropriate property type. However, note that this is not always a valid way of checking if an object has a property or not, because you could have a property that is set to undefined, in which case, using typeof x.key would still return true (even though the key is still in the object).Update: You can check if a property exists by comparing to the undefined javascript property This should work unless key was specifically set to undefined on the x objectLet\'s cut through some confusion here. First, let\'s simplify by assuming hasOwnProperty already exists; this is true of the vast majority of current browsers in use.hasOwnProperty returns true if the attribute name that is passed to it has been added to the object. It is entirely independent of the actual value assigned to it which may be exactly  undefined.Hence:However:The problem is what happens when an object in the prototype chain has an attribute with the value of undefined? hasOwnProperty will be false for it, and so will !== undefined. Yet, for..in will still list it in the enumeration.The bottom line is there is no cross-browser way (since Internet Explorer doesn\'t expose __prototype__) to determine that a specific identifier has not been attached to an object or anything in its prototype chain.If you are searching for a property, then "NO".  You want:In general you should not care whether or not the property comes from the prototype or the object.However, because you used \'key\' in your sample code, it looks like you are treating the object as a hash, in which case your answer would make sense.  All of the hashes keys would be properties in the object, and you avoid the extra properties contributed by the prototype.John Resig\'s answer was very comprehensive, but I thought it wasn\'t clear.  Especially with when to use "\'prop\' in obj".Yes it is :)  I think you can also do Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(x, \'key\') which should also work if x has a property called hasOwnProperty :)But that tests for own properties.  If you want to check if it has an property that may also be inhered you can use typeof x.foo != \'undefined\'.Becausefails if x.key resolves to false (for example, x.key = "").You can also use the ES6 Reflect object:Documentation on MDN for Reflect.has can be found here.The static Reflect.has() method works like the in operator as a function.For testing simple objects use:\n    if (obj[x] !== undefined)If you don\'t know what object type it is use: \n    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(x))All other options are slower..DetailsPerformance evaluation of 100,000,000 cycles under Nodejs to the 5 options suggested by others here:The evaluation tells us that unless we specifically want to check the object\'s prototype chain as well as the object itself, we should not use the common form:  if (X in Obj)... It is between 2 to 6 times slower depending on the use case Bottom line, if your Obj is not necessarily a simple object and you wish to avoid checking the object\'s prototype chain and to ensure x is owned by Obj directly, use \'if (obj.hasOwnProperty(x))...\'.Otherwise, when using a simple object and not being worried about the object\'s prototype chain, using if (typeof(obj[x]) !== \'undefined\')... is the safest and fastest way. If you use a simple object as a hash table and never do anything kinky, I would use if (obj[x])... as I find it much more readable.Have fun.OK, it looks like I had the right answer unless if you don\'t want inherited properties:Here are some other options to include inherited properties:hasOwnProperty "can be used to determine whether an object has the specified property as a direct property of that object; unlike the in operator, this method does not check down the object\'s prototype chain." So most probably, for what seems by your question, you don\'t want to use hasOwnProperty, which determines if the property exists as attached directly to the object itself,.If you want to determine if the property exists in the prototype chain you main want to use in, like:I hope this helps.Another relatively simple way is using Object.keys. This returns an array which means you get all of the features of an array.Although we are in a world with great browser support. Because this question is so old I thought I\'d add this: \nThis is safe to use as of JS v1.8.5With risk of massive downvoting, here is another option for a specific case. :)If you want to test for a member on an object and want to know if it has been set to something other than:then you can use:ECMA Script 6 solution with reflect. Create wrapper like:If the key you are checking is stored in a variable, you can check it like this:You can also use this open source reusable component I wrote called object-hasOwnProperty.Example:It\'s quite simple:You need to use the method object.hasOwnProperty(property). It returns true if the object has the property and false if the object doesn\'t.
