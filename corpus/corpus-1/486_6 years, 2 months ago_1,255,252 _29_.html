Is there any way to convert an entire user inputted string from uppercase, or even part uppercase to lowercase? E.g. Kilometers --> kilometers.The official documentation is str.lower().This doesn\'t work for non-English words in utf-8. In this case decode(\'utf-8\') can help:You can do what Peter said, or\nif you want the user to input something you could do this:It will then automatically convert the thing they typed into lowercase.Note: raw_input was renamed to input in Python 3.x and above.Is there any way to convert an entire user inputted string from uppercase, or even part uppercase to lowercase? E.g. Kilometers --> kilometersThe canonical Pythonic way of doing this is However, if the purpose is to do case insensitive matching, you should use case-folding:This is a str method in Python 3, but in Python 2, you\'ll want to look at the PyICU or py2casefold - several answers address this here.Python 3 handles unicode as regular strings:But Python 2 does not, the below, pasted into a shell, encodes the literal as a string of bytes, using utf-8.And lower doesn\'t map any changes that native Unicode objects would be aware of, so we get the same string. In scripts, Python will object to non-ascii (as of Python 2.5, and warning in Python 2.4) bytes being in a string with no encoding given, since the intended coding would be ambiguous. For more on that, see the Unicode how-to in the docs and PEP 263So we need a unicode string to handle this conversion, accomplished easily with a unicode literal:Note that the bytes are completely different from the str bytes - the escape character is \'\\u\' followed by the 2-byte width, or 16 bit representation of these unicode letters:Now if we only have it in the form of a str, we need to convert it to unicode. Python\'s Unicode type is a universal encoding format that has many advantages relative to most other encodings. We can either use the unicode constructor or str.decode method with the codec to convert the str to unicode:Both methods convert to the unicode type - and same as the unicode_literal.It is recommended that you always work with text in Unicode.Software should only work with Unicode strings internally, converting to a particular encoding on output.However, to get the lowercase back in type str, encode the python string to utf-8 again:So in Python 2, Unicode can encode into Python strings, and Python strings can decode into the Unicode type.also, you can overwrite some variables:if you use like this:it will work just when call.     If the whole text is uppercase like "KILOMETER", and you only want the first character to be lowercased, then doBut to lowercase the whole string, do
