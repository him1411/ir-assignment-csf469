I create a new branch in Git:Push it:Now say someone made some changes on the server and I want to pull from origin/my_branch. I do:But I get:I learned that I can make it work with:But why do I need to do this for every branch I create? Isn\'t it obvious that if I push my_branch into origin/my_branch, then I would want to pull origin/my_branch into my_branch? How can I make this the default behavior?A shortcut, which doesn\'t depend on remembering the syntax for git branch --set-upstream 1 is to do:... the first time that you push that branch.  You only need to do it once, and that sets up the association between your branch and the one at origin in the same way as git branch --set-upstream does.Personally, I think it\'s a good thing to have to set up that association between your branch and one on the remote explicitly.  It\'s just a shame that the rules are different for git push and git pull.1 It may sound silly, but I very frequently forget to specify the current branch, assuming that\'s the default - it\'s not, and the results are most confusing :)Update 2012-10-11: Apparently I\'m not the only person who found it easy to get wrong! Thanks to VonC for pointing out that git 1.8.0 introduces the more obvious git branch --set-upstream-to, which can be used as follows, if you\'re on the branch my_branch:... or with the short option:This change, and its reasoning, is described in the release notes for git 1.8.0, release candidate 1:It was tempting to say git branch --set-upstream origin/master, but that tells Git to arrange the local branch origin/master to integrate with the currently checked out branch, which is highly unlikely what the user meant.  The option is deprecated; use the new --set-upstream-to (with a short-and-sweet -u) option instead.You can make this happen with less typing. First, change the way your push works:This will infer the origin my_branch part, thus you can do:Which will both create the remote branch with the same name and track it.You can simplyin the first place. If you set branch.autosetupmerge or branch.autosetuprebase (my favorite) to always (default is true), my-branch will automatically track origin/whatever.See git help config.You can set upstream simpler in two ways. First when you create the branch:or after you have created a branch, you can use this command.You can also branch, check out and set upstream in a single command:My personally preference is to do this in a two-step command:You can use:git config --global branch.autosetupmerge alwayswhich will link the upstream branch each time you create or checkout a new branch.See https://felipec.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/advanced-git-concepts-the-upstream-tracking-branch/This also works with autosetuprebase, if you follow a more rebase focused workflow, but don\'t use this unless you know what you\'re doing, as it will default your pull behavior to rebase, which can cause odd results. By the way, the shortcut to pushing the current branch to a remote with the same name:You can also explicitly tell git pull what remote branch to pull (as it mentions in the error message):git pull <remote-name> <remote-branch>Be careful with this, however: if you are on a different branch and do an explicit pull, the refspec you pull will be merged into the branch you\'re on!I use this Git alias instead of copy/pasting the suggestion from Git every time: https://gist.github.com/ekilah/88a880c84a50b73bd306Source copied below (add this to your ~/.gitconfig file):For what it is worth, if you are trying to track a branch that already exists on the remote (eg. origin/somebranch) but haven\'t checked it out locally yet, you can do:Note: \'-t\' is the shortened version of \'--track\' option.This sets up the same association right off the bat.You can set up a really good alias that can handle this without the overly verbose syntax.I have the following alias in ~/.gitconfig:After making a commit on a new branch, you can push your new branch by simply typing the command:Because git has the cool ability to push different branches (from the same repo) to different "upstream" repositories.\nAs a consequence, it does not make assumption about where you want to push your branch to.\nOn the other hand, this capability is seldom  used so it might make a good case for a default option.
