How can you make the experience with Eclipse faster?  For instance: I disable all the plugins I don\'t need (Mylyn, Subclipse, …).Instead of using a plugin for Mercurial, I configure TortoiseHG as an external tool.The three most influential factors for Eclipse speed are:The "same" workspace in Indigo (3.7.2) SR2 loads in 4 seconds, in Kepler SR2 (4.3.2) in 7 seconds and in Luna (4.4.0) in 10 seconds. All are Java EE bundles. Newer versions have more bundled plugins, but still the trend is obvious. (by "same" workspace I mean: same (additionally installed) plugins used, same projects checked out from version control).Launching it with the latest JDK (1.7 at the time of writing, which does not prevent you to compile in your Eclipse project with any other JDK you want: 1.4.2, 1.5, 1.6 older...)-vm jdk1.6.0_10\\jre\\bin\\client\\jvm.dllConfiguring the eclipse.ini (see this question for a complete eclipse.ini)-Xms128m\n-Xmx384m\n-XX:MaxPermSize=128m # NOTE: this option is obsolete in Java 8, it will be ignored\n-Xss2m\n[...]The Xmx argument is the amount of memory Eclipse will get (in simple terms). With -Xmx384m, it gets 384 MB of RAM, with -Xmx4G it gets 4 GB, etc.Note: Referring to the jvm.dll has advantages:But it can also have some drawbacks if you try to push the memory too high.The default memory taken by Eclipse is the combination of MaxPermSize and Xmx. Here up to 512 MB total, which is quite enough for a 1 GB memory computer.Add -Xverify:none to your eclipse.ini file.It will cut down your Eclipse startup time considerably (50% in my case if not more). This will tell the VM not to validate all the .class files it is loading. Go to Windows -> Preferences -> Validation and uncheck any validators you don\'t want or need.For Eclipse 3.7, you use Windows -> Preferences -> General -> Startup and Shutdown.Make sure that you\'re using the Sun JVM to run Eclipse.On Linux, particularly Ubuntu, Eclipse is installed by default to use the open source GCJ, which has drastically poorer performance. Use update-alternatives --config java to switch to the Sun JVM to greatly improve UI snappiness in Eclipse.Close any open projects which are not in current use.Try to switch off the auto publish mode during development.Thanks for the hints. \nThese options (mentioned above) helped me a lot:Windows: Increasing memory & regarding to my updated Java version in eclipse.ini:Linux / Ubuntu:UsingAnother performance boost can be gained by disabling label decorations\n(Windows -> Preferences; General -> Appearance -> Label Decorations)\nand by disabling unused capabilities on startup\n(Windows -> Preferences; General -> Startup and Shutdown).You may also get additional performance by choosing a different garbage collection strategy depending on your JVM.If you\'re fed up with restart cycles you could use JavaRebel from ZeroTurnaround. That will shorten your time spent on server/client restarts.While not directly related to Eclipse:If you\'re running Windows 7 (and presumably Windows Vista), be sure to disable the file indexing of your workspace folder if your stuff is is in the default place - your home folder. Windows by default indexes everything in you home folder, and it\'s normally just a waste for your workspace. (Right click the workspace folder in explorer , Properties -> Advanced.)Disable virus scanners, or at least configure any virus scanner to not scan JAR files on read access.Eclipse loads plug-ins lazily, and most common plug-ins,\nlike Subclipse, don\'t do anything if you don\'t use them.\nThey don\'t slow Eclipse down at all during run time, and it\nwon\'t help you to disable them. In fact, Mylyn was shown to\nreduce Eclipse\'s memory footprint when used correctly.I run Eclipse with tons of plug-ins without any performance\npenalty at all.It\'s not only the memory that you need to increase with the -Xmx\nswitch, it\'s also the perm gen size. I think that\nproblem was solved in Eclipse 3.4.There is another thing that really speeds up Eclipse on both Windows and especially Linux - putting the JVM in RAM disk.For Windows you can use the commercial RAM disk driver from Qsoft.For Linux use any of the methods described in numerous articles on the Internet. It is important to give additional space to the RAM disk that is 10% bigger than the size of the JVM.Check it out. It really makes a difference.I give it a ton of memory (add a -xMx whateverM switch to the command that starts it) and try to avoid quitting and restarting it- I find the worst delays are on startup, so giving it lots of RAM lets me keep going longer before it crashes out.Along with the latest software (latest Eclipse and Java) and more RAM, you may need to  reference:making-eclipse-ide-fasterNot to be underrated is having a fast machine. 16-32 GB of RAM, SSD and a decent processor... and who0o0om there you go. I implemented a plug-in to configure which features to be loaded in runtime to improve the performance and reduce the conflict among different plug-ins.You may have installed many features into your Eclipse, such as Android development tools, C/C++ development tools, PHP, SVN, Git and ClearCase plug-ins. Hence Eclipse is heavy and costs a lot of memory, and some of them are not often used.So you could use my tool to create different runtime policies, such as one that has Android, Git and base Eclipse, another one contains C/C++, SVN and base Eclipse. Next time Eclipse would only load the specified features if you\'re using the policy that only has Android and Git.You are welcome to try it and give me the feedback. :)The name of that tool is Equinox Advanced Configurator.Make an effort to configure your build path. Code completion uses a lot of memory if it has to go through your whole project folder.One more trick is to disable automatic builds.   I also tuned vmargs and stuff. But what really sped up Eclipse on Windows is the "proper" configuration of the anti-virus software. You have to disable the on-demand scanning of packed files. jar files, and many files related to java are packed with PKZIP algorithm to spare space. Because Eclipse uses tons of java files, an anti-virus attempts to individually unpack and scan every one of them. So for Windows platform: turn off the on-demand scanning of packed files, otherwise Eclipse will be unusably slow. Please keep in mind, that disabling this unfortunately makes your system weaker against attacks, most of the malware use packers.Best practices in this thread are implemented in the free Optimizer For Eclipse, from ZeroTurnaround.What does it help with?For more details, check out this article from RebelLabs.I experienced a considerable improvement in performance when limiting the number of open tabs (in the past I frequently had 30+ tabs open). You can let Eclipse handle this for you automatically:Window -> Preferences -> Editors -> close editors automatically8 open tabs is the amount before the >> sign appears, so I tend to leave it at 8.When opening more tabs, the ones the least recently accessed will be closed.->When all editors are dirty or pinnedIf it has unsaved modifications you can prompt to save & reuse (tab will be closed, a new one will be opened in its place). Or you can open a new editor end thus increase the amount of open tabs (the unobtrusive choice).If you want to ensure some tabs never get closed autmatically, you can pin them. This by clicking on the pin icon (the rightmost icon in the toolbar, with "pin editor" as tooltiptext).I\'ve disabled all unused options in Windows > Preferences > General and it has a huge positive impact on performance, eclipse is still slow when switching tabs, I don\'t want to increase memory, but it\'s a lot faster when scrolling. Thx for the tips.Eclipse will run faster when working with small projects. But when you have to work with large project, you will get irritated with its speed.

Better to have around 20 tabs . Regularly close the unused tabs. To open resource we can always use ctrl+shift+R and ctrl+shift+T (java resource) instead of opening lot of tabs\nI experienced a considerable improvement in performance when limiting the number of open tabs (In the past I frequently had 30+ tabs open). You can let eclipse handle this for you automatically:\nWindow->Preferences->Editors-> close editors automatically\n8 open tabs is the amount before the >> sign appears, so I set 14 as my default value.\nWhen opening more tabs, the ones the least recently accessed will be closed.

I use ivy and on top of that I have certain JAR files (internal) changing with same version, so it has to workout all the time to fetch them. If you have defined you project on a network drive then you will also experience lag during build/read/write type of processes.Disable/uninstall plugins you don\'t need.Close perpective that you don\'t needClose unused database connectionsIn special cases, bad performance can be due to corrupt h2 or nwire databases. Read Five tips for speeding up Eclipse PDT and nWire for more information.Where I work, we are dependent on a VM to run Debian. I have installed another Eclipse version on the VM for testing purpouses, but this sometimes creates conflicts if I have the other Eclipse version running. There is a shared folder which both of the Eclipse versions shares. I accidentally left the Debian Eclipse installation running in the background once and that gave me corrupt database files.The only real way to hasten Eclipse with the standard plug-ins is to give it more memory and in some cases access to a faster storage space / defragmented hard drive. Beyond that there is not much you can do performance-wise: most standard plug-ins do not have a continuous runtime cost, even Mylyn is relatively fast. Upgrading to the latest JVM supported on your machine may help as well.Some people downgrade to older Eclipse versions to get better performance. It may also make sense to use Eclipse classic instead of the official releases.Try these. There are two ways.First ProcedureRefer this article.http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/06/the-real-way-to-make-eclipse-run-faster-on-ubuntu.htmlSecond Procedure.Execute the command in the terminal.to get better performance and fast response for Ubuntu.Ramdisk is part of system memory. Ubuntu by default uses a half of physical memory (RAM) as ramdisk, and it is mounted onto/dev/shm, it can be used just like normal disk space (create files and folders and manipulate them with better performance rather if they were stored on the hard disk). If ramdisk uses more than a half of RAM, data will be moved into the swap space. If ramdisk uses less, the remaining can still do what RAM\xe2\x80\x99s doing.Set upper limit of ramdiskAs is said above, ramdisk by default can use a half of RAM. If you want to change the upper limit, follow the steps below:Edit /etc/fstab by your favourate editor:gksudo gedit /etc/fstabFind this line and change to make it looks like this(add this line if not exist, and change 512M to what you like.):tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,size=512M 0 0Reboot or re-mount/dev/shmMount /tmp onto ramdiskTo make it easy to use, you can mount a directory intoby following commands:mkdir /dev/shm/tmpchmod 1777 /dev/shm/tmpmount --bind /dev/shm/tmp /tmpOn Windows 8. \nOpen Control panel. Find Windows Defender. Go to settings\nExclude all folders where is your Spring/Eclipse  and workspaceClose the outline view to speed up switching between editors.\nEach time you switch to a different tab or open a file, the outline view has to update, which on my machine took about 1 second every time. It\'s just 1 second, but if you change tabs very often, like me, it will save you a headache.
