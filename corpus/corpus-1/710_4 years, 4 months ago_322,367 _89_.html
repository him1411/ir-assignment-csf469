What files should be in my .gitignore for an Android Studio project?I have seen several examples that all include .iml but IntelliJ docs say that .iml must be included in your source control.Update:\nSince Android Studio 2.2, new projects are created with this gitignore file:Verify if it suits your needs and if not, read on.Previous:A late answer but none of the answers here and here was right on the money for us...So, here\'s our gitignore file:Optional - for older project format, add this section to your gitignore file:This file should be located in the project\'s root folder and not inside the project\'s module folder.Edit Notes:Since version 0.3+ it seems you can commit and push *.iml and build.gradle files. If your project is based on Gradle: in the new open/import dialog, you should check the "use auto import" checkbox and mark the "use default gradle wrapper (recommended)" radio button. All paths are now relative as @George suggested.Updated answer according to @128KB attached source and @Skela suggestionsBuilding on my normal Android .gitignore, and after reading through documentation on the Intellij IDEA website and reading posts on StackOverflow, I have constructed the following file:Also note that as pointed out, the built native files section is primarily useful when you are building your own native code with the Android NDK. If, on the other hand, you are using a third party library that includes these files, you may wish to remove these lines (*.o and *.so) from your .gitignore.Updated 7/2015:Here is the definitive source from JetBrainsThis format is used by all the recent IDE versions by default. Here is what you need to share:Be careful about sharing the following:You may consider not to share the following:Legacy project format (.ipr/.iml/.iws files)While these instructions are for IntelliJ IDEA, they hold true 100% for Android Studio.Here is a .gitignore snippet that incorporates all of the above rules:I disagree with all of these answers.  The following configuration is working great for our organization\'s app.I ignore:I think almost everyone agrees about /build.I got sick of constantly seeing messages about the various library.xml files that Gradle creates or deletes in /.idea.  The build.gradle will run on the developers\'s local when they first check out the project, so why do those XML files need to be versioned?  Android Studio will also generate the rest of /.idea when a developer creates a project using Check out from Version Control, so why does anything in that folder need to be versioned?If the *.iml is versioned a new user will have to name the project exactly the same as it was when committed.  Since this is also a generated file, why version it in the first place?The local.properties files points to an absolute path on the file system for the SDK, so it definitely shouldn\'t be versioned.Edit 1:  Added .gradle to ignore the gradle caching stuff that should not be versioned (thanks Vasily Makarov).Edit 2:  Added .DS_Store now that I am using Mac.  This folder is Mac specific and should not be versioned.Additional note: You probably also want to add a directory to put your signing keys in when building a release version.For copy/paste convenience:I use this .gitignore. I found it at: http://th4t.net/android-studio-gitignore.htmlIn the case of Android Studio, the only files that are required to be saved in version control are the files required to build the application from the command line using gradle. So you can ignore:However, if you save any IDE settings, such as custom code style settings, they get saved in the .idea folder. If you want those changes in version control, then you\'d save the IDEA files as well (*.iml and .idea).My advise would be also to not ignore the .idea folder. I imported a Git-based Eclipse project to Android Studio and that went fine. Later I wanted to import this project with Git (like the first time) to another machine with Android Studio, but that didnt work. Android Studio did load all the files but wasnt able to "see" the project as a project. I only could open Git-files.While importing the project the first time (from Eclipse to Android Studio) my old .gitignore was overwritten and the new one looked like this:So I tried to use an empty gitignore and now it worked. The other Android Studio could load the files and the Project. I guess some files are not important (profiles_settings.xml) for Git and importing but I am just happy it worked. There is NO NEED to add to the source control any of the following:So you can configure hgignore or gitignore accordingly.The first time a developer clones the source control can go:That\'s allPS: Android Studio will then, through maven, get the gradle plugin assuming that your build.gradle looks similar to this:Android studio will generate the content of .idea folder (including the workspace.xml, which shouldn\'t be in source control because it is generated) and the .gradle folder.This approach is Eclipse-friendly in the way that the source control does not really know anything about Android Studio. Android Studio just needs the build.gradle to import a project and generate the rest.I support the committing of .idea  folder (excluding workspace.xml and tasks.xml). But I am starting to come to the conclusion that .iml files should be ignored.Here is the issue:Open a project in a directory named "foo" for example and you will get foo.iml and that all seems well and good. The problem is that if I simply rename the directory to foo2 (or clone it into another directory name) when you try to open the project in Android Studio you will get three things:I can find no way to prevent Android Studio from doing this iml file generation when the project is stored in a different directory. Adding them to source control is going to cause problems. Therefore I think perhaps we should ignore *.iml files and .idea/modules.xmlit\'s the best way to generate .gitignore via here: http://www.gitignore.io/Depends on how your project format is maintained:You have two options:\n1) Directory-based format (You will have a .idea folder which contains the project specific files)\n2) File-based format ( configuration files are .iws and .ipr)Ref:\nhttp://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/project.htmlFiles committed to version control depends on the above:\n1) include .idea folder to version control, exclude workspace.xml and tasks.xml\n2) version control .ipr file and and all the .iml module files, exclude the .iws file as it stores user specific settings.Ref:\nhttps://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/entries/23393067As of Android Studio 0.8.4 .gitignore file is generated automatically when starting new project.\nBy default it contains:For Android Studio 2.3 (I used it for 2.1 and 2.2 too) I use the following:The only thing that should be in your (Gradle) project folder after repository cloning is this structure (at least for the use cases I encountered so far):Basically any file that is automatically regenerated.A good test is to clone your repo and see if Android Studio is able to interpret and run your project immediately (generating what is missing).\nIf not, find what is missing, and make sure it isn\'t ignored, but added to the repo.That being said, you can take example on existing .gitignore files, like the Android one.I\'m kosher with adding the .iml files and Intellij sez to add the .idea folder but ignore .idea/workspace.xml and .idea/tasks.xml, but what about .idea/libraries/ ?I don\'t see how it makes sense to add this.  It has a list of XML files that list libraries the Android Studio project is supposed to know about.  These are supposed to come instead from build.gradle defined dependencies -- not an IDE project file.Also the contents of one of these files looks like this:It doesn\'t make sense to commit this.  What if the user specified a different home dir for gradle, or if they use a different gradle version, the path under .gradle/caches/artifacts-xxx is going to be different for them (i.e. artifacts- the number appended on the end will relate to the gradle version release you are using.)  These paths are not universal, and yet the advice is to check all this in?I know this is an old topic and there are certainly a lot of options, but I really prefer gibo by Simon Whitaker. It\'s super simple to use, cross-platform (mac, *nix, and windows), and uses the github gitignore repo so it is (basically) always up to date. Make sure your local cache is up to date:Search for the language/technology you need:Display the .gitignore file:Now, append it to your project\'s .gitignore file:(Make sure you use >> to append to your project\'s .gitignore file; one > will overwrite it - as I\'ve done many times on accident!)I know this isn\'t answering the OP\'s exact question, but using gibo makes it so you pretty much don\'t have to think about \'the question\' anymore! .. it\'s nice! ;)To get a better idea, all you need are the following files You could put everything else in the .gitignore file. All your app changes lies mostly in these files and folders. The rest you see in a basic project are gradle build files or Android Studio configuration files.If you are using Android Studio, you can use "Import project" to successfully build the project. Alternatively you can build using command line, follow Building Android Projects with Gradle.It\'s best to add up the .gitignore list through the development time to prevent unknown side effect when Version Control won\'t work for some reason because of the pre-defined (copy/paste) list from somewhere. For one of my project, the ignore list is only of:As of Android Studio 0.8.4 .gitignore file is generated automatically when starting new project. By default it contains:I agree with this statement, however I modify this file to change\n/build to build/\n(This will include /build and /app/build)\nSo I don\'t end up with all the files in app/build in my repository.Note also that if you import a project from Eclipse, the .gitignore won\'t be copied, or "automagically" created for you.I merge Github .gitignore filesPlease read: JetBrains Support: How to manage projects under Version Control SystemsGithub maintains useful gitignore items for various kinds of projects. \nHere is the list of useful gitignore items for android projects.Android Gitignore in githubThis official documentation from JetBrains Support says the following should be included:It also gives other recommendations of things to be careful about.Compilation:I had problems with ignoring build files, but this seems to work :-)
