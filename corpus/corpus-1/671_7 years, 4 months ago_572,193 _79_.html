I am trying to print an integer in JavaScript with commas as thousands separators. For example, I want to show the number 1234567 as "1,234,567". How would I go about doing this? Here is how I am doing it:Is there a simpler or more elegant way to do it? It would be nice if it works with floats also, but that is not necessary. It does not need to be locale-specific to decide between periods and commas. I used the idea from Kerry\'s answer, but simplified it since I was just looking for something simple for my specific purpose. Here is what I did:This is all you really need to know.@Neils Bom asked how the regex works. My explanation is sort of long. It won\'t fit in the comments and I don\'t know where else to put it so I am doing it here. If anyone has any other suggestions for where to put it, please let me know.The regex uses 2 lookahead assertions: a positive one to look for any point in the string that has a multiple of 3 digits in a row after it, and a negative assertion to make sure that point only has exactly a multiple of 3 digits. The replacement expression puts a comma there.For example, if you pass it "123456789.01", the positive assertion will match every spot to the left of the 7 (since "789" is a multiple of 3 digits, "678" is a multiple of 3 digits, "567", etc.). The negative assertion checks that the multiple of 3 digits does not have any digits after it. "789" has a period after it so it is exactly a multiple of 3 digits, so a comma goes there. "678" is a multiple of 3 digits but it has a "9" after it, so those 3 digits are part of a group of 4, and a comma does not go there. Similarly for "567". "456789" is 6 digits, which is a multiple of 3, so a comma goes before that. "345678" is a multiple of 3, but it has a "9" after it, so no comma goes there. And so on. The "\\B" keeps the regex from putting a comma at the beginning of the string.@neu-rah mentioned that this function adds commas in undesirable places if there are more than 3 digits after the decimal point. If this is a problem, you can use this function:I\'m surprised nobody mentioned Number.prototype.toLocaleString.\nIt\'s implemented in JavaScript 1.5 (which was introduced in 1999) so it\'s basically supported across major browsers.It also works in Node.js as of v0.12 via inclusion of IntlIf you want something different, Numeral.js might be interesting.\xe2\x9a\xa0 Mind that javascript has a maximum integer value of 9007199254740991toLocaleString:\nNumberFormat (Safari not supported):From what I checked (Firefox at least) they are both more or less same regarding performance.I suggest using phpjs.org \'s number_format()UPDATE 02/13/14People have been reporting this doesn\'t work as expected, so I did a JS Fiddle that includes automated tests.This is a variation of @mikez302\'s answer, but modified to support numbers with decimals (per @neu-rah\'s feedback that numberWithCommas(12345.6789) -> "12,345.6,789" instead of "12,345.6789"Thanks to everyone for their replies. I have built off of some of the answers to make a more "one-size-fits-all" solution. The first snippet adds a function that mimics PHP\'s number_format() to the Number prototype. If I am formatting a number, I usually want decimal places so the function takes in the number of decimal places to show. Some countries use commas as the decimal and decimals as the thousands separator so the function allows these separators to be set.You would use this as follows:I found that I often needed to get the number back for math operations, but parseFloat converts 5,000 to 5, simply taking the first sequence of integer values. So I created my own float conversion function and added it to the String prototype.Now you can use both functions as follows:Number.prototype.toLocaleString() would have been awesome if it was provided natively by all browsers (Safari). I checked all other answers but noone seemed to polyfill it. Here is a poc towards that, which is actually a combination of first two answers; if toLocaleString works it uses it, if it doesn\'t it uses a custom function.I think this is the shortest regular expression that does it:I checked it on a few numbers and it worked.if you are dealing with currency values and formatting a lot then it might be worth to add tiny accounting.js which handles lot of edge cases and localization:The thousands separator can be inserted in an international-friendly manner using the browser\'s Intl object:See MDN\'s article on NumberFormat for more, you can specify locale behavior or default to the user\'s. This is a little more foolproof because it respects local differences; many countries use periods to separate digits while a comma denotes the decimals.Intl.NumberFormat isn\'t available in all browsers yet, but it works in latest Chrome, Opera, & IE. Firefox\'s next release should support it. Webkit doesn\'t seem to have a timeline for implementation.The following code uses char scan, so there\'s no regex. It shows promising performance: http://jsperf.com/number-formatting-with-commas/52015.4.26: Minor fix to resolve issue when num<0. See https://jsfiddle.net/runsun/p5tqqvs3/I Wrote this one before stumbling on this post. No regex and you can actually understand the code.Here\'s a simple function that inserts commas for thousand separators.  It uses array functions rather than a RegEx.Let me try to improve uKolka\'s answer and maybe help others save some time.Use Numeral.js.You should go with Number.prototype.toLocaleString() only if its browser compatibilty is not an issue.For me, the best answer is using toLocaleString like some members said.\nIf you want to include the \'$\' symbol just add languaje and type options.\nHere is and example to format a number to Mexican PesosshortcutI think this function will take care of all the issues related to this problem.Here\'s my try:EDIT: Added in decimalsI think your solution is one of the shorter ones I\'ve seen for this. I don\'t think there are any standard JavaScript functions to do this sort of thing, so you\'re probably on your own.I checked the CSS 3 specifications to see whether it\'s possible to do this in CSS, but unless you want every digit in its own <span>, I don\'t think that\'s possible.I did find one project on Google Code that looked promising: flexible-js-formatting. I haven\'t used it, but it looks pretty flexible and has unit tests using JsUnit. The developer also has a lot of posts (though old) about this topic.Be sure to consider international users: lots of nations use a space as the separator and use the comma for separating the decimal from the integral part of the number. Lots of good answers already. Here\'s another, just for fun:Some examples:I added tofixed to Aki143S\'s solution.\nThis solution uses dots for thousands separators and comma for the precision.Examples;The solution from @user1437663 is great.Who really understands the solution is being prepared to understand complex regular expressions.A small improvement to make it more readable:The pattern starts with \\B to avoid use comma at the beginning of a word. Interestingly, the pattern is returned empty because \\B does not advance the "cursor" (the same applies to $).O \\B is followed by a less known resources but is a powerful feature from Perl\'s regular expressions.The magic is that what is in parentheses (Pattern2) is a pattern that follows the previous pattern (Pattern1) but without advancing the cursor and also is not part of the pattern returned. It is a kind of future pattern. This is similar when someone looks forward but really doesn\'t walk! In this case pattern2 is     It means 3 digits (one or more times) followed by the end of the string ($)Finally, Replace method changes all occurrences of the pattern found (empty string) for comma. This only happens in cases where the remaining piece is a multiple of 3 digits \n(such cases where future cursor reach the end of the origin).An alternative way, supporting decimals, different separators and negatives.I\'ve adapted your code to work in TextBox (Input type="text") so we can enter and delete digits in real time without losing cursor. It\'s works also if you select range when you delete. And you can use arrows and home/end buttons freely.\nThanks for saving my time!To use this just added two events - onKeyUp and onKeyDownI thought I\'d share a little trick which I\'m using for large number formatting.\nInstead of inserting commas or spaces, I insert an empty but visible span in between the "thousands". This makes thousands easily visible, but it allows to copy/paste the input in the original format, without commas/spaces.With this CSS:See an example JSFiddle. For Integers I used a very simple method:Yet another..(for int\'s as the question asks)I wanted something simple that was easy to read. I\'m only concerned with integers and I don\'t need high performance (so optimizing for readability over performance):JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Enw85/1/Here is good solution with less coding...
