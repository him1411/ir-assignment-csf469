Which files should I include in .gitignore when using Git in conjunction with Xcode?Mods: Please do not approve edits to this answer. So far, every edit has been INCORRECT and causes DATA LOSS. Please leave this answer alone!If you want to edit this answer ... don\'t. Read the whole thing first - there\'s an easy way for you to make your own fork, and if that\'s not enough then comment on it.I was previously using the top-voted answer, but it needs a bit of cleanup, so here it is re-done for Xcode 4, with some improvements.I\'ve researched every file in this list, but several of them do not exist in Apple\'s official xcode docs, so I had to go on Apple mailing lists.Apple continues to add undocumented files, potentially corrupting our live projects. This IMHO is unacceptable, and I\'ve now started logging bugs against it each time they do so. I know they don\'t care, but maybe it\'ll shame one of them into treating developers more fairly.If you need to customize, here\'s a gist you can fork: https://gist.github.com/3786883Based on this guide for Mercurial my .gitignore includes:I\'ve also chosen to include:which, according to this Apple mailing list post, are "user-specific project settings". And for Xcode 4:Regarding the \'build\' directory exclusion - If you place your build files in a different directory from your source, as I do, you don\'t have the folder in the tree to worry about.This also makes life simpler for sharing your code, preventing bloated backups, and even when you have dependencies to other Xcode projects (while require the builds to be in the same directory as each other)You can grab an up-to-date copy from the Github gist https://gist.github.com/708713My current .gitignore file isFor Xcode 4 I also add:I included these suggestions in a Gist I created on Github: http://gist.github.com/137348Feel free to fork it, and make it better.I\'m using both AppCode and XCode.\nSo .idea/ should be ignored.append this to Adam\'s .gitignoreThe people of GitHub have exhaustive and documented .gitignore files for Xcode projects:Swift: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Swift.gitignoreObjective-C: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Objective-C.gitignoreMine is a .bzrignore, but same idea :)the tm_build_errors is for when I use TextMate to build my project. Not quite as comprehensive as Hagelin but I thought it was worth posting for the tm_build_errors line.Heres a script I made to auto create your .gitignore and .gitattributes files using Xcode... I hacked it together with a few other people\'s stuff.  Have fun!Xcode-Git-User-ScriptNo warranties... I suck at most of this - so use at your own perilYou should checkout gitignore.io for Objective C and SwiftHere is the .gitignore file I\'m usingadding .gitignore file forMAC OS X + XCode  + SwiftThis is how, I have added .gitignore file into my Swift projectHere is the result structureWell thanks to Adam, his answer helped me a lot but still I had to add few more entry as I wanted .gitignore forMAC OS X + XCode  + SwiftReferences : this and thisFor XCode 5 I add:From Berik\'s AnswerI use the following .gitignore file generated in gitignore.io:I\'ve added:and placed my .gitignore file at the root of my project.After committing and pushing.  I then ran:buried with the folder below:I then ran git commit and push againHere\'s the .gitignore that GitHub uses by default for new Xcode repositories:https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Objective-C.gitignoreIt\'s likely to be reasonably correct at any given time.We did find that even if you add the .gitignore and the .gitattribte the *.pbxproj file can get corrupted. So we have a simple plan.Every person that codes in office simply discards the changes made to this file. In the commit we simple mention the files that are added into the source. And then push to the server. Our integration manager than pulls and sees the commit details and adds the files into the resources.Once he updates the remote everyone will always have a working copy. In case something is missing then we inform him to add it in and then pull once again.This has worked out for us without any issues. best of all, gitignore.ioGo and choose your language, then it\'ll give you the file.
