I would like to find out, in Javascript, which element currently has focus. I\'ve been looking through the DOM and haven\'t found what I need, yet. Is there a way to do this, and how?The reason I was looking for this:I\'m trying to make keys like the arrows and enter navigate through a table of input elements. Tab works now, but enter and arrows do not by default it seems. I\'ve got the key handling part set up but now I need to figure out how to move the focus over in the event handling functions.Use document.activeElement, it is supported in all major browsers.Previously, if you were trying to find out what form field has focus, you could not. To emulate detection within older browsers, add a "focus" event handler to all fields and record the last-focused field in a variable. Add a "blur" handler to clear the variable upon a blur event for the last-focused field.Related links:As said by JW, you can\'t find the current focused element, at least in a browser-independent way. But if your app is IE only (some are...), you can find it the following way :EDIT: It looks like IE did not have everything wrong after all, this is part of HTML5 draft and seems to be supported by the latest version of Chrome, Safari and Firefox at least.If you can use jQuery, it now supports :focus, just make sure you are using version 1.6+.This statement will get you the currently focused element.From: How to select an element that has focus on it with jQuerydocument.activeElement is now part of the HTML5 working draft specification, but it might not yet be supported in some non-major/mobile/older browsers.  You can fall back to querySelector (if that is supported).  It\'s also worth mentioning that document.activeElement will return document.body if no element is focused â€” even if the browser window doesn\'t have focus.The following code will work around this issue and fall back to querySelector giving a little better support.An addition thing to note is the performance difference between these two methods.  Querying the document with selectors will always be much slower than accessing the activeElement property.  See this jsperf.com test.I liked the approach used by Joel S, but I also love the simplicity of document.activeElement. I used jQuery and combined the two. Older browsers that don\'t support document.activeElement will use jQuery.data() to store the value of \'hasFocus\'. Newer browsers will use document.activeElement. I assume that document.activeElement will have better performance.document.activeElement may default to the <body> element if no focusable elements are in focus. Additionally, if an element is focused and the browser window is blurred, activeElement will continue to hold the focused element.If either of these two behaviors are not desirable, consider a CSS-based approach: document.querySelector( \':focus\' ).A little helper that I\'ve used for these purposes in Mootools:This way you can check if element has focus with el.hasFocus() provided that startFocusTracking() has been called on the given element. JQuery does support the :focus pseudo-class as of current.  If you are looking for it in the JQuery documentation, check under "Selectors" where it points you to the W3C CSS docs.  I\'ve tested with Chrome, FF, and IE 7+.  Note that for it to work in IE, <!DOCTYPE... must exist on the html page.  Here is an example assuming you\'ve assigned an id to the element that has focus:Reading other answers, and trying myself, it seems document.activeElement will give you the element you need in most browsers.If you have a browser that doesn\'t support document.activeElement if you have jQuery around, you should be able populate it on all focus events with something very simple like this (untested as I don\'t have a browser meeting those criteria to hand):If you\'re using jQuery, you can use this to find out if an element is active:There are potential problems with using document.activeElement. Consider:If the user focuses on an inner-div, then document.activeElement still references the outer div. You cannot use document.activeElement to determine which of the inner div\'s has focus.The following function gets around this, and returns the focused node:If you would rather get the focused element, use:By itself, document.activeElement can still return an element if the document isn\'t focused. You may want that behavior, but if you don\'t, you can check document.hasFocus():To check whether a specific element has focus:Alternatively you can use events, but this requires setup and assumes an initial state:If you want to get a object that is instance of Element, you must use document.activeElement, but if you want to get a object that is instance of Text, you must to use document.getSelection().focusNode.I hope helps.With dojo, you can use dijit.getFocus()Just putting this here to give the solution I eventually came up with.I created a property called document.activeInputArea, and used jQuery\'s HotKeys addon to trap keyboard events for arrow keys, tab and enter, and I created an event handler for clicking into input elements.Then I adjusted the activeInputArea every time focus changed, so I could use that property to find out where I was.It\'s easy to screw this up though, because if you have a bug in the system and focus isn\'t where you think it is, then its very hard to restore the correct focus.An almost browser independent way to achieve this was made by Quirksmode a long time ago. It could have issues with Safari as Safari does not always set events on the same elements than Chrome or Firefox does. Sometimes Safari even sets the event on the textnode instead of the containing element. This can be rectified afterwards ofcourse (by checking the nodeType).Here it is:Hope it helps.Thanks to Quirksmode
