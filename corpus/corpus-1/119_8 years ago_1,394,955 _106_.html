I would like to know how to delete a commit.By "delete", I mean it is as if I didn\'t make that commit, and when I do a push in the future, my changes will not push to the remote branch.I read git help, and I think the command I should use is git reset --hard HEAD.  Is this correct?Careful: git reset --hard WILL DELETE YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY CHANGES. Be sure to stash any local changes you want to keep before running this command.Assuming you are sitting on that commit, then this command will wack it...The HEAD~1 means the commit before head.Or, you could look at the output of git log, find the commit id of the commit you want to back up to, and then do this:If you already pushed it, you will need to do a force push to get rid of it...However, if others may have pulled it, then you would be better off starting a new branch.  Because when they pull, it will just merge it into their work, and you will get it pushed back up again.If you already pushed, it may be better to use git revert, to create a "mirror image" commit that will undo the changes.  However, both commits will be in the log.FYI -- git reset --hard HEAD is great if you want to get rid of WORK IN PROGRESS.  It will reset you back to the most recent commit, and erase all the changes in your working tree and index.Lastly, if you need to find a commit that you "deleted", it is typically present in git reflog unless you have garbage collected your repository.If you have not yet pushed the commit anywhere, you can use git rebase -i to remove that commit. First, find out how far back that commit is (approximately). Then do:The ~N means rebase the last N commits (N must be a number, for example HEAD~10). Then, you can edit the file that Git presents to you to delete the offending commit. On saving that file, Git will then rewrite all the following commits as if the one you deleted didn\'t exist.The Git Book has a good section on rebasing with pictures and examples.Be careful with this though, because if you change something that you have pushed elsewhere, another approach will be needed unless you are planning to do a force push.Another possibility is one of my personal favorite commands:This will start the rebase in interactive mode -i at the point just before the commit you want to whack. The editor will start up listing all of the commits since then. Delete the line containing the commit you want to obliterate and save the file. Rebase will do the rest of the work, deleting only that commit, and replaying all of the others back into the log.I\'m appending this answer because I don\'t see why anyone who has just tried to commit work would want to delete all that work because of some mistake using Git!If you want to keep your work and just \'undo\' that commit command (you caught before pushing to repo):Do not use the --hard flag unless you want to destroy your work in progress since the last commit.If you didn\'t publish changes, to remove latest commit, you can do(note that this would also remove all uncommitted changes; use with care).If you already published to-be-deleted commit, use git revertIf you want to fix up your latest commit, you can undo the commit, and unstage the files in it, by doing:This will return your repository to its state before the git add commands that staged the files. Your changes will be in your working directory. HEAD~1 refers to the commit below the current tip of the branch.If you want to uncommit N commits, but keep the code changes in your working directory:If you want to get rid of your latest commit, and do not want to keep the code changes, you can do a "hard" reset.Likewise, if you want to discard the last N commits, and do not want to keep the code changes:Removing an entire commitObviously replace "SHA" with the reference you want to get rid of. The "^" in that command is literal.http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.htmlPS: CommitId refers the one which you want to revert back toTo delete in local branch, useTo delete in a remote branch, use Here \'2\' is the number of commits you want to rebase.   if you want to rebase all the commits.Then you will be able to choose one of these options.p, pick = use commitr, reword = use commit, but edit the commit messagee, edit = use commit, but stop for amendings, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commitf, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit\'s log messagex, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shelld, drop = remove commitThese lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.\n If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.\n However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.\n Note that empty commits are commented outYou can simply remove that commit using option "d" or Removing a line that has your commit.Assuming you don\'t just want to delete the last commit, but you want to delete specific commits of the last n commits, go with:git rebase -i HEAD~<number of commits to go back>, so git rebase -i HEAD~5 if you want to see the last five commits.Then in the text editor change the word pick to drop next to every commit you would like to remove. Save and quit the editor. Voila!All the commands above restore the state of your work tree and index as they were before making the commit, but do not restore the state of the repository. If you look at it, the "removed" commit is not actually removed, it is simply not the one on the tip of the current branch.I think that there are no means to remove a commit with porcelain commands. The only way is to remove it from the log and reflog and then to execute a git prune --expire -now.Here\'s another way to do this:Checkout the branch you want to revert, then reset your local working copy back to the commit that you want to be the latest one on the remote server (everything after it will go bye-bye). To do this, in SourceTree I right-clicked on the and selected "Reset BRANCHNAME to this commit". I think the command line is:Since you just checked out your branch from remote, you\'re not going to have any local changes to worry about losing. But this would lose them if you did.Then navigate to your repository\'s local directory and run this command:This will erase all commits after the current one in your local repository but only for that one branch.If you just messed up your last commit (wrong message, forgot to add some changes) and want to fix it before pushing it to a public repo why not use:If you have newly staged changes they\'ll be combined with the last commit (that you\'re trying to get rid of) and will replace that commit.Of course if you amend a commit after you\'ve pushed it, you\'re rewriting history so if you do that be sure to understand the implications.You can also pass the \'--no-edit\' option instead of \'-m\' if you would prefer to use the previous commit\'s message.Docs:\nhttp://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit.htmlIf you want to keep the history, showing the commit and the revert, you should use:enter the message explaining why are you reverting and then:When you issue git log you\'ll see both the "wrong" commit and revert log messages.The mistake:I git rebase -i --root\'ed my branch, ignorantly thinking I could reword the first commit differing from the master (the GitHub for Windows default view is the comparison to master, hiding it\'s entirety).I grew a Silicon Valley beard while 900+ commits loaded themselves into Sublime. Exiting with no changes, I charged my battery then proceeded to shave, as all 900+ individual commits nonchalantly rebased - resetting their commit times to now.Determined to beat Git and preserve the original times, I deleted this local repository and re-cloned from the remote.Now it had re-added a most recent unneeded commit to master I wished to remove, so proceeded like so.Exhausting the options:I didn\'t wish to git revert - it would create an additional commit, giving Git the upper hand.git reset --hard HEAD did nothing, after checking the reflog, the last and only HEAD was the clone - Git wins.To get the most recent SHA, I checked the remote repository on github.com - minor win.After thinking git reset --hard <SHA> had worked, I updated another branch to master and 1... 2... poof! the commit was back - Git wins.Checking back out to master, time to try git rebase -i <SHA>, then remove the line... to no avail, sad to say. "If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST". Ah...glossed over new feature troll the n00b in the 2.8.3 release notes.The solution:git rebase -i <SHA> then d, drop = remove commit.To verify, I checked out to another branch, and voila - no hiding commit to fetch/pull from the master.https://twitter.com/holman/status/706006896273063936Good day to you.Assuming you have not pushed to the remote repository, you could re-clone the repository. This has been my method of choice a few times.git reset --hard git push origin HEAD --forceIf one or more of the commits is tagged, delete the tag(s) first. Otherwise the tagged commit is not removed.Take backup of your code in to temp folder.\nFollowing command will reset same as server.Then copy the required files alone from temp folder, then commitIf you\'ve already pushed, first find the commit you want to be at HEAD ($GIT_COMMIT_HASH_HERE), then run the following:Then each place the repo has been cloned, run:What I do usually when I commit and push (if anyone pushed his commit this solve the problem):hope this helpSay we want to remove commits 2 & 4 from the repo. Note: You need to have admin rights over the repo since you are using --force.use git revert  https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert .It will revert all code then you can do next commit.Then head will point to that last commit. reverted commits never delete but it will not affect on you last commit.  I know this question is fully answered, but I\'d like to summarize the (few) safe steps to undo a git commit for those (like me) who were in panic after a bad commit:go into the source directory and make a backup of your code with command:tar czvf code.tgz *display the git commit list with the command:git logget the "sha1-commit-id" of the commit under your unwanted commit, this is the id of the commit before yours (the git log lists the more recent commit first)revert back the unwanted commit with the commandgit reset --hard "sha1-commit-id"*you can check you did it correctly by issuing anoter git log command*get back your uncommited code with the command:tar xzvf code.tgzThe tar commands are used to get sure your hard work does not get wiped by mistake, as the git reset command will delete your working directory changes, so step 1 and 5 are used to stash the local changes.
