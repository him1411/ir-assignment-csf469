How do I make the first letter of a string uppercase, but not change the case of any of the other letters?For example:Another solution:Some other answers modify String.prototype (this answer used to as well), but I would advise against this now due to maintainability (hard to find out where the function is being added to the prototype and could cause conflicts if other code uses the same name / a browser adds a native function with that same name in future).A more object-oriented approach:And then:In CSS:Here is a shortened version of the popular answer that gets the first letter by treating the string as an array:Update:According to the comments below this doesn\'t work in IE 7 or below.Update 2:To avoid undefined for empty strings (see @njzk2\'s comment below), you can check for an empty string:For another case I need it to capitalize the first letter and lowercase the rest. The following cases made me change this function:Here are the fastest methods based on this jsperf test (ordered from fastest to slowest).As you can see, the first two methods are essentially comparable in terms of performance, whereas altering the String.prototype is by far the slowest in terms of performance.Capitalize the first letter of all words in a string: Here are the best solutions:First Solution In CSS:Second solution :You could also add it to the String.prototype so you could chain it with other methods:and use it like this:Third Solution:And then:then capitalize("hello") // HelloWe could get the first character with one of my favorite RegExp, looks like a cute smiley: /^./And for all coffee-junkies:...and for all guys who think that there\'s a better way of doing this, without extending native prototypes:If you use underscore.js or Lo-Dash, the underscore.string library provides string extensions, including capitalize:_.capitalize(string) Converts first letter of the string to\n  uppercase.Example:It seems to be easier in CSS: This is from CSS text-transform Property (at W3Schools).If you\'re already (or considering) using lodash, the solution is easy:See their docs: https://lodash.com/docs#capitalize_.camelCase(\'Foo Bar\'); //=> \'fooBar\'https://lodash.com/docs/4.15.0#camelCaseVanilla js for first upper case:If you are wanting to reformat all-caps text, you might want to modify the other examples as such: This will ensure that the following text is changed:Usage:This is a text string => This Is A Text StringCheckout this solution:  Here is a function called ucfirst() (short for "upper case first letter"):You can capitalise a string by calling ucfirst("some string") -- for example,It works by splitting the string into two pieces.  On the first line it pulls out firstLetter and then on the second line it capitalises firstLetter by calling firstLetter.toUpperCase() and joins it with the rest of the string, which is found by calling str.substr(1).You might think this would fail for an empty string, and indeed in a language like C you would have to cater for this. However in JavaScript, when you take a substring of an empty string, you just get an empty string back.(You may encapsulate it in a function or even add it to the String prototype if you use it frequently.)The ucfirst function works if you do it like this.Thanks J-P for the aclaration.Since there are numerous answers, but none in ES6 that would solve original problem efficiently, I came up with mine. I also have few remarks and performed a benchmark.In CoffeeScript, add to the prototype for a string:Usage would be:Which yields:Usage:it will return "Ruby java"http://jsfiddle.net/amitpandya/908c8e2v/result link in jsfiddleCoffeeScript As String prototype method:One possible solution:Use this:Here is working JS FiddleUsing prototypesor Using functions
