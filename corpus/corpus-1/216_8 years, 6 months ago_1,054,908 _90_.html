I have a JavaScript object like the following:Now I want to loop through all p elements (p1,p2,p3...) and get their keys and values. How can I do that?I can modify the JavaScript object if necessary. My ultimate goal is to loop through some key value pairs and if possible I want to avoid using eval.You can use the for-in loop as shown by others. However, you also want to make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn\'t come from the prototype:Under ECMAScript 5, you can combine Object.keys() and Array.prototype.forEach():ES2016 adds for...of:ES2017 adds Object.entries() which avoids having to look up each value in the original object:Both Object.keys() and Object.entries() iterate properties in the same order as a for...in loop but ignore the prototype chain. Only the object\'s own enumerable properties are iterated.You have to use the for-in loopBut be very careful when using this kind of loop, because this will loop all the properties along the prototype chain.Therefore, when using for-in loops, always make use of the hasOwnProperty method to determine if the current property in iteration is really a property of the object you\'re checking on:The question won\'t be complete if we don\'t mention about alternative methods for looping through objects.Nowadays many well known JavaScript libraries provide their own methods for iterating over collections, i.e. over arrays, objects, and array-like objects. These methods are convenient to use and are entirely compatible with any browser.If you work with jQuery, you may use jQuery.each() method. It can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays:In Underscore.js you can find method _.each(), which iterates over a list of elements, yielding each in turn to a supplied function (pay attention to the order of arguments in iteratee function!):Lo-Dash provides several methods for iterating over object properties. Basic _.forEach() (or it\'s alias _.each()) is useful for looping through both objects and arrays, however (!) objects with length property are treated like arrays, and to avoid this behavior it is suggested to use _.forIn() and _.forOwn() methods (these also have value argument coming first):_.forIn() iterates over own and inherited enumerable properties of an object, while _.forOwn() iterates only over own properties of an object (basically checking against hasOwnProperty function). For simple objects and object literals any of these methods will work fine.Generally all described methods have the same behaviour with any supplied objects. Besides using native for..in loop will usually be faster than any abstraction, such as jQuery.each(), these methods are considerably easier to use, require less coding and provide better error handling.In ECMAScript 5 you have new approach in iteration fields of literal - Object.keysMore information you can see on MDNMy choice is below as a faster solution in current versions of browsers (Chrome30, IE10, FF25)You can compare performance of this approach with different implementations on jsperf.com:Browser support you can see on Kangax\'s compat tableFor old browser you have simple and full polyfillUPD:performance comparison for all most popular cases in this question on perfjs.info:object literal iterationYou can just iterate over it like:Note that key will not take on the value of the property, it\'s just an index value.via prototype with forEach() which should skip the prototype chain properties:After looking through all the answers in here, hasOwnProperty isn\'t required for my own usage because my json object is clean; there\'s really no sense in adding any additional javascript processing. This is all I\'m using:Object.keys(obj) : Arrayretrieves all string-valued keys of all enumerable own (non-inherited) properties.So it gives the same list of keys as you intend by testing each object key with hasOwnProperty. You don\'t need that extra test operation than and Object.keys( obj ).forEach(function( key ){}) is supposed to be faster. Let\'s prove it:In my Firefox I have following resultsPS. on Chrome the difference even bigger http://codepen.io/dsheiko/pen/JdrqXaPS2: In ES6 (EcmaScript 2015) you can iterate iterable object nicer: Since es2015 is getting more and more popular I am posting this answer which include usage of generator and iterator to smoothly iterate through [key, value] pairs. As it is possible in other languages for instance Ruby.Ok here is a code:All information about how can you do an iterator and generator you can find at developer Mozilla page.Hope It helped someone.EDIT:ES2017 will include Object.entries which will make iterating over [key, value] pairs in objects even more easier. It is now known that it will be a part of a standard according to the ts39 stage information.I think it is time to update my answer to let it became even more fresher than it\'s now.You can find more about usage on\nMDN pageIt\'s interesting people in these answers have touched on both Object.keys() and for...of but never combined them:You can\'t just for...of an Object because it\'s not an iterator, and for...index or .forEach()ing the Object.keys() is ugly/inefficient.\nI\'m glad most people are refraining from for...in (with or without checking .hasOwnProperty()) as that\'s also a bit messy, so other than my answer above, I\'m here to say...You can make ordinary object associations iterate! Behaving just like Maps with direct use of the fancy for...of\nDEMO working in Chrome and FF (I assume ES6 only)So long as you include my shim below:Without having to create a real Map object that doesn\'t have the nice syntactic sugar.In fact, with this shim, if you still wanted to take advantage of Map\'s other functionality (without shimming them all in) but still wanted to use the neat object notation, since objects are now iterable you can now just make a Map from it!For those who don\'t like to shim, or mess with prototype in general, feel free to make the function on window instead, calling it something like getObjIterator() then;orThere\'s no reason why that wouldn\'t work.Welcome to the future.Note: you can do this over arrays, but you\'ll iterate over the length and other properties, too.You can add a simple forEach function to all objects, so you can automatically loop through any object:For those people who don\'t like the "for ... in"-method:Now, you can simple call:If you don\'t want to get conflicts with other forEach-Methods you can name it with your unique name.If you want to iterate over non-enumerable properties as well, you can use Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj) to return an array of all properties (enumerable or not) found directly upon a given object.Only JavaScript code without dependencies:Loops can be pretty interesting when using pure JavaScript. It seems that only ECMA6 (New 2015 JavaScript specification) got the loops under control. Unfortunately as I\'m writing this, both Browsers and popular Integrated development environment (IDE) are still struggling to support completely the new bells and whistles.At a glance here is what a JavaScript object loop look like before ECMA6:Also, I know this is out of scope with this question but in 2011, ECMAScript 5.1 added the forEach method for Arrays only which basically created a new improved way to loop through arrays while still leaving non iterable objects with the old verbose and confusing for loop. But the odd part is that this new forEach method does not support break which led to all sorts of other problems.Basically in 2011, there is not a real solid way to loop in JavaScript other than what many popular libraries (jQuery, Underscore, etc.) decided to re-implement.As of 2015, we now have a better out of the box way to loop (and break) any object type (including Arrays and Strings). Here is what a loop in JavaScript will eventually look like when the recommendation becomes mainstream:Note that most browsers won\'t support the code above as of June 18th 2016. Even in Chrome you need to enable this special flag for it to work: chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmonyUntil this becomes the new standard, the old method can still be used but there are also alternatives in popular libraries or even lightweight alternatives for those who aren\'t using any of these libraries.Considering ES6 I\'d like to add my own spoon of sugar and provide one more approach to iterate over object\'s properties.Since plain JS object isn\'t iterable just out of box, we aren\'t able to use for..of loop for iterating over its content. But no one can stop us to make it iterable.Let\'s we have book object.Since we\'ve made it we can use it this way:Or if you know the power of ES6 generators, so you certainly can make the code above much shorter.Sure, you can apply such behavior for all objects with making Object iterable on prototype level.Also, objects that comply with the iterable protocol can be used with the new ES2015 feature spread operator thus we can read object property values as an array.Or you can use destructuring assignment:You can check out JSFiddle with all code I\'ve provided above.I would do this rather than checking obj.hasOwnerProperty within every for ... in loop.If anybody needs to loop through arrayObjects with condition:In ES6 we have well-known symbols to expose some previously internal methods, you can use it to define how iterators work for this object:this will give the same result as using for...in es6 loop.But its important to know the capabilities you now have using es6!Since ES2015 you can use the for of loop, to access the element directly:Hope this helps someone.Besause the asker\'s [\'ultimate goal is to loop through some key value pairs\'] and finally don\'t looking for a loop.
