Why does Java have transient fields?The transient keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized.From the Java Language Specification, Java SE 7 Edition, Section 8.3.1.3. transient Fields:Variables may be marked transient to\n  indicate that they are not part of the\n  persistent state of an object.For example, you may have fields that are derived from other fields, and should only be done so programmatically, rather than having the state be persisted via serialization. Here\'s a GalleryImage class which contains an image and a thumbnail derived from the image:In this example, the thumbnailImage is a thumbnail image that is generated by invoking the generateThumbnail method.The thumbnailImage field is marked as transient, so only the original image is serialized rather than persisting both the original image and the thumbnail image. This means that less storage would be needed to save the serialized object. (Of course, this may or may not be desirable depending on the requirements of the system -- this is just an example.)At the time of deserialization, the readObject method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object back to the state at which the serialization occurred. Here, the thumbnail needs to be generated, so the readObject method is overridden so that the thumbnail will be generated by calling the generateThumbnail method.For additional information, the Discover the secrets of the Java Serialization API article (which was originally available on the Sun Developer Network) has a section which discusses the use of and presents a scenario where the transient keyword is used to prevent serialization of certain fields.Before understanding the transient keyword, one has to understand the concept of serialization. If the reader knows about serialization, please skip the first point.Serialization is the process of making the object\'s state persistent. That means the state of the object is converted into a stream of bytes and stored in a file. In the same way, we can use the deserialization to bring back the object\'s state from bytes. This is one of the important concepts in Java programming because serialization is mostly used in networking programming. The objects that need to be transmitted through the network have to be converted into bytes. For that purpose, every class or interface must implement the Serializable interface. It is a marker interface without any methods.By default, all of object\'s variables get converted into a persistent state. In some cases, you may want to avoid persisting some variables because you don\'t have the need to persist those variables. So you can declare those variables as transient. If the variable is declared as transient, then it will not be persisted. That is the main purpose of the transient keyword.I want to explain the above two points with the following example:And the output will be the following:Middle Name is declared as transient, so it will not be stored in the persistent storage.SourceTo allow you to define variables that you don\'t want to serialise. In an object you may have information that you don\'t want to serialise/persist (perhaps a reference to a parent factory object), or perhaps it doesn\'t make sense to serialise. Marking these as \'transient\' means the serialisation mechanism will ignore these fields.My small contribution :What is transient variable in Java?\nIn simple sentence any variable which is modified with transient keyword becomes transient variable in java.\nWhy do we need transient variable in java?\nTransient keyword provides you some control over serialization process and gives you flexibility to exclude some of object properties from serialization process. Some time it does make sense not to serialize certain attributes of an object, we will see which variables should not be serialized and should be made transient in next section.\nWhich variable you should mark transient?\nSince we know the purpose of transient keyword or having transient variable its make sense to think about which variable should be marked as transient. My rule is that any variable whose value can be calculated from other variables doesn\'t require to be saved. For example if you have a field called "interest" whose value can be derived from other fields e.g. principle, rate, time etc then there is no need to serialize it.\nAnother example is of word count, if you are saving article then no need to save word count, because it can be created when article gets deserialized. Another good example of transient keyword is "Logger" since most of the time you have logger instance for logging in Java but you certainly don\'t want it to serialize correct?A transient variable is a variable that may not be serialized. One example of when this might be useful that comes to mind are variables that make only sense in the context of a specific object instance and which become invalid once you have serialized and deserialized the object. In that case it is useful to have those variables become null instead so that you can re-initialize them with useful data when needed. transient is used to indicate that a class field doesn\'t need to be serialized.\nProbably the best example is a Thread field. There\'s usually no reason to serialize a Thread, as its state is very \'flow specific\'. Because not all variables are of a serializable natureSerialization systems other than the native java one can also use this modifier. Hibernate, for instance, will not persist fields marked with either @Transient or the transient modifier. Terracotta as well respects this modifier.I believe the figurative meaning of the modifier is "this field is for in-memory use only. don\'t persist or move it outside of this particular VM in any way. Its non-portable". i.e. you can\'t rely on its value in another VM memory space. Much like volatile means you can\'t rely on certain memory and thread semantics.Serialization is the process of saving an object\xe2\x80\x99s states in a persistent format (such as file stream or database), and later restoring them back from the stream (de-serialization). \nIn Java, an object of a class is serializable if the class implements the java.io.Serializable interface. This is a marker interface which tells the JVM that the class is eligible for serialization. There are three important points in this model class:\nIt must implements the Serializable interface. Otherwise, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a java.io.NotSerializableException when trying to serialize an object of the class.\nA constant named serialVersionUID  is declared and assigned a long value:This is a conventional constant which should be declared when a class implements the Serializable interface. The serial version UID strongly ensures compatibility between the serialized and de-serialized versions of objects of a class, because the process of serialization and de-serialization can happen on different computers and systems. Although this declaration is optional, it\xe2\x80\x99s always recommended to declare the serialVersionUID for a serializable class.Notice that the password field is marked as transient: Because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want store the password when serializing the object. The rule is, when a variable is marked as transient, its object won\xe2\x80\x99t be serialized during serialization.  A transient variable is a variable that may not be serialized. You use the transient keyword to indicate to the Java virtual machine that the indicated variable is not part of the persistent state of the object.The access modifiers supported by Java are static, final, abstract, synchronized, native, volatile, transient and strictfp.Following table gives the list of access specifiers and modifiers Java that can be applied to variables, methods and classes.Before I respond to this question, I must explain to you the SERIALIZATION, because if you understand what it means serialization in science computer you can easily understand this keyword.Serialization\nWhen an object is transferred through the network / saved on physical media(file,...), the object must be "serialized". Serialization converts byte status object series. These bytes are sent on the network/saved and the object is re-created from these bytes.\nExampleNow IF YOU WANT TO do NOT TRANSFERT/SAVED field of this object SO, you can use keyword transient Example It\'s needed when you don\'t want to share some sensitive data that go with serialization.as per google\ntransient meaning ==  lasting only for a short time; impermanent.now if want to make anything transient in java use transient keyword.Q: where to use transient? A: Generally in java we can save data to files by acquiring them in variables and writing those variables to files, this process is known as Serialization. Now if we want to avoid variable data to be written to file, we would make that variable as transient.transient int result=10;Note: transient variables cannot be local.
