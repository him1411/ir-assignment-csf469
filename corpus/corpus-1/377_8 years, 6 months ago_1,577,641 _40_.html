Is there a way to substring a string in Python, to get a new string from the 3rd character to the end of the string?Maybe like myString[2:end]?If leaving the second part means \'till the end\', if you leave the first part, does it start from the start?Python calls this concept "slicing" and it works on more than just strings. Take a look here for a comprehensive introduction.Just for completeness as nobody else has mentioned it.  The third parameter to an array slice is a step.  So reversing a string is as simple as:Or selecting alternate characters would be:The ability to step forwards and backwards through the string maintains consistency with being able to array slice from the start or end.Substr() normally (i.e. PHP, Perl) works this way: So the parameters are beginning and LENGTHBut Python\'s behaviour is different, it expects beginning and one after END (!). This is difficult to spot by beginners. So the correct replacement for Substr(s, beginning, LENGTH) isA common way to achieve this is by String slicing. MyString[a:b] gives you a substring from index a to (b - 1)One example seems to be missing here: full (shallow) copy.This is a common idiom for creating a copy of sequence types (not of interned strings). [:] Shallow copies a list, See python-list-slice-used-for-no-obvious-reason.You\'ve got it right there except for "end".  Its called slice notation.  Your example should read.If you leave out the second param it is implicitly the end of the string.I would like to add two points to the discussion:You can use None instead on an empty space to specify "from the start" or "to the end":This is particularly helpful in functions, where you can\'t provide an empty space as an argument:Python has slice objects:Maybe I missed it, but I couldn\'t find a complete answer on this page to the original question(s) because variables are not further discussed here. So I had to go on searching.Since I\'m not yet allowed to comment, let me add my conclusion here. I\'m sure I was not the only one interested in it when accessing this page:  If you leave the first part, you get   And if you left the : in the middle as well you got the simplest substring, which would be the 5th character (count starting with 0, so it\'s the blank in this case):Is there a way to substring a string in Python, to get a new string from the 3rd character to the end of the string?Maybe like myString[2:end]?Yes this actually works if you assign end to None:Slice notation has 3 important arguments:Their defaults when not given are None - but we can pass them explicitly:If leaving the second part means \'till the end\', if you leave the first part, does it start from the start?Yes, for example:Note that we include start in the slice, but we only go up to, and not including, stop.When step is None, by default the slice uses 1 for the step. If you step with a negative integer, Python is smart enough to go from the end to the beginning.No one mention about using hardcode indexes itself can be a mess. In order to avoid that, python offers a built-in object slice(). If we want to know how many money I got left. Normal solution:Using slices:You can notice using slice you gain readabilityI believe this is what you\'re looking for. When you want to substring everything after index 2 (including 2), you just use : and nothing else. Hope that helps!
