Convention has it that table names should be the singular of the entity that they store attributes of.  I dislike any T-SQL that requires square brackets around names, but I have renamed a Users table to the singular, forever sentencing those using the table to sometimes have to use brackets.  My gut feel is that it is more correct to stay with the singular, but my gut feel is also that brackets indicate undesirables like column names with spaces in them etc.Should I stay, or should I go?Others have given pretty good answers as far as "standards" go, but I just wanted to add this... Is it possible that "User" (or "Users") is not actually a full description of the data held in the table? Not that you should get too crazy with table names and specificity, but perhaps something like "Widget_Users" (where "Widget" is the name of your application or website) would be more appropriate.I had same question, and after reading all answers here I definitely stay with SINGULAR, reasons:Reason 1 (Concept). You can think of bag containing apples like "AppleBag", it doesn\'t matter if contains 0, 1 or a million apples, it is always the same bag. Tables are just that, containers, the table name must describe what it contains, not how much data it contains. Additionally, the plural concept is more about a spoken language one (actually to determine whether there is one or more).Reason 2. (Convenience). it is easier come out with singular names, than with plural ones. Objects can have irregular plurals or not plural at all, but will always have a singular one (with few exceptions like News).Reason 3. (Aesthetic and Order). Specially in master-detail scenarios, this reads better, aligns better by name, and have more logical order (Master first, Detail second):Compared to:Reason 4 (Simplicity). Put all together, Table Names, Primary Keys, Relationships, Entity Classes... is better to be aware of only one name (singular) instead of two (singular class, plural table, singular field, singular-plural master-detail...)Once you know you are dealing with "Customer", you can be sure you will use the same word for all of your database interaction needs.Reason 5. (Globalization). The world is getting smaller, you may have a team of different nationalities, not everybody has English as native language. Would be easier for a non-native English language programmer to think of "Repository" than of "Repositories", or avoid them type "Statuses" instead of "Status". Having singular names can lead to less errors caused by typos, save time by avoid spending extra seconds to think "is it Child or Children?", hence improving productivity.Reason 6. (Why not?). It can even save you writing time, save you disk space, and even make your computer keyboard lasts more!You have saved 3 letters, 3 bytes, 3 extra keyboard hits :)And finally, you can name those ones messing up with reserved names like:Or use the infamous squared brackets [User]In his book "SQL Programming Style," Joe Celko suggests that a collection (e.g. a table) should be named in the plural, while a scalar data element (e.g. a column) should be named in the singular.He cites ISO-11179-4 as a standard for metadata naming, which supports this guideline.Let me argue why this makes sense.Debunking the fallacies. The most popular answer saysReason 1 (Concept). You can think of bag containing apples like\n  "AppleBag", it doesn\'t matter if contains 0, 1 or a million apples, it\n  is always the same bag. Tables are just that, containers, the table\n  name must describe what it contains, not how much data it contains.\n  Additionally, the plural concept is more about a spoken language one\n  (actually to determine whether there is one or more), a table is not\n  intended to be read by a human.Lets convert AppleBag => BagOfApples. Now, the same "conceptual" argument says somehting opposite to itself, we see Apples and therefore answer must be plural!This is because there is nothing conceptual in this ****. It fails even to reason about English language, the simple logic. In English, a BagOfApples != AnApple! The argument "Bag contains 0,1, .. millions" of apples just proves that the collection must be called "Apples", likewise Java arguments or stackoverflow.com/posts. Somehow, the enemies of civilization manage to conclude that singular must be used here. The posts is just a folder. Why should it be plural? Let\'s teach mr. Artuwood some logic: folder is a folder and must describe what it contains, not how much data it contains. In fact, if you start thinking you realize that apple contains apple describes nonsense. The true concept is that Bag contains Apples. Either we name our container Bag(of specific kind) or think what it contains, the Apples (those dirty bastards tried to reduce that to the numbering problem. But we are after apples, not their number.). Yes, if we abstract the wrapper away, we realize that we are after Apples, what is contained in it. We fetch and iterate either a Bag or Apples, not apple.Reason 2. (Convenience). it is easier come out with singular names,\n  than with plural ones. Objects can have irregular plurals or not\n  plural at all, but will always have a singular one (with few\n  exceptions like News).Customer Order User Status NewsWhich convenience is he talking about? Let\'s just point out that that plural come out simpler than singulars. Reason 3. (Aesthetic and Order). Aestetics is on our side. It is simple, as he did. We just claim that and that is all what is needed to turn the table.Reason 4 (Simplicity). Put all together, Table Names, Primary Keys,\n  Relationships, Entity Classes... is better to be aware of only one\n  name (singular) instead of two (singular class, plural table, singular\n  field, singular-plural master-detail...)Am I alone seeing that for simplicity, everything must become singular? Yes, forget the plural using English language. It will make things simpler. In fact, in many languages, sex is attached to all things, not only boys and girls. This is stupid and makes language unnecessarily complex. But, I have noticed that it simplifies the referencing. When I say "fox, dog and wolf" in Russian and then say "he", it unambiguisly means that I am referencing the "wolf" because "fox" and "dog" are "she". Now you say that distinction that helps to reduce ambiguity creates it. How so?Probably, the logic is "let\'s keep arbitrary crap in our language and enforce the disorder by removing the rules which make sense". Yes, the proposal to use singular where logic demands plural while keeping to attach inappropriate attributes like sex to inappropriate items is a pursuit of nonsense in our crazy world. As of SELECT activity.name reads better than SELECT\n  activities.nameYou probably need to SELECT student.name FROM students as studentOk, here probably is the argument: how is table\'s alias is singular if table is plural? Ok, this makes some sense. But saying that column (object\'s attribute) is singular, therefore, the object collection must be singular as well, is nonsense.Reason 5. (Globalization). The world is getting smaller, you may have\n  a team of different nationalities, not everybody has English as native\n  language. Would be easier for a non-native English language programmer\n  to think of "Repository" than of "Repositories", or avoid them type\n  "Statuses" instead of "Status". Having singular names can lead to less\n  errors caused by typos, save time by avoid spending extra seconds to\n  think "is it Child or Children?", hence improving productivity.This bigot will break his mind, no doubt. But why other non-native speakers, like me, should buy making nonsense "for simplicity and internationalization"? Why not improve our English and keep the logic unraped? It is much easier to understand the language in this case, after all. Otherwise, we should also abandon the verbs, the articles, the adjectives and speak only in nouns, for simplicity. It would be simpler (and more productive) if we limit our speech to moooo and nothing else, for the animals to be able to speak English as well. This way we achieve much wider internationalization.Reason 6. (Why not?). It can even save you writing time, save you disk\n  space, and even make your computer keyboard lasts more!This argument supports why we should abandon the plurals in our human communaction as well. No, instead of moooo, mo moo, moo moo, we will say I, III, III, II. Much shorter than with singular proposal. The bottom line is that all the "arguments" against plural is pure bullshit. If you think about it, it says against singular. When all you have to support your position is bullshit, it means that you need bullshit to support your view, you are on a wrong side. The only meaningful argument for the singular is that table is a very special set of objects. Table is a Class! Yes, it contains all objects of specific type and we use singular for class names. Class Dog contains all dogs. What is dog1? It is a Dog. On the other hand, users deal with tables as collections. They add/remove items into collection and we use plural for collections. If you use Object Relational Mapping tools or will in the future I suggest Singular.Some tools like LLBLGen can automatically correct plural names like Users to User without changing the table name itself. Why does this matter? Because when it\'s mapped you want it to look like User.Name instead of Users.Name or worse from some of my old databases tables naming tblUsers.strName which is just confusing in code.My new rule of thumb is to judge how it will look once it\'s been converted into an object.one table I\'ve found that does not fit the new naming I use is UsersInRoles. But there will always be those few exceptions and even in this case it looks fine as UsersInRoles.Username.I prefer to use the uninflected noun, which in English happens to be singular.Inflecting the number of the table name causes orthographic problems (as many of the other answers show), but choosing to do so because tables usually contain multiple rows is also semantically full of holes. This is more obvious if we consider a language that inflects nouns based on case (as most do):Since we\'re usually doing something with the rows, why not put the name in the accusative case? If we have a table that we write to more than we read, why not put the name in dative? It\'s a table of something, why not use the genitive? We wouldn\'t do this, because the table is defined as an abstract container that exists regardless of its state or usage. Inflecting the noun without a precise and absolute semantic reason is babbling.Using the uninflected noun is simple, logical, regular and language-independent.What convention requires that tables have singular names? I always thought it was plural names.A user is added to the Users table.This site agrees:\nhttp://vyaskn.tripod.com/object_naming.htm#TablesThis site disagrees (but I disagree with it):\nhttp://justinsomnia.org/writings/naming_conventions.htmlAs others have mentioned: these are just guidelines. Pick a convention that works for you and your company/project and stick with it. Switching between singular and plural or sometimes abbreviating words and sometimes not is much more aggravating.I am of the firm belief that in an Entity Relation Diagram, the entity should be reflected with a singular name, similar to a class name being singular.  Once instantiated, the name reflects its instance.  So with databases, the entity when made into a table (a collection of entities or records) is plural. Entity, User is made into table Users.  I would agree with others who suggested maybe the name User could be improved to Employee or something more applicable to your scenario.This then makes more sense in a SQL statement because you are selecting from a group of records and if the table name is singular, it doesn\'t read well.How about this as a simple example:vs.The SQL in the latter is stranger sounding than the former.I vote for singular.I stick with singular for table names and any programming entity.The reason? The fact that there are irregular plurals in English like mouse \xe2\x87\x92 mice and sheep \xe2\x87\x92 sheep.  Then, if I need a collection, i just use mouses or sheeps, and move on.It really helps the plurality stand out, and I can easily and programatically determine what the collection of things would look like.So, my rule is: everything is singular, every collection of things is singular with an s appended. Helps with ORMs too. Singular. I don\'t buy any argument involving which is most logical - every person thinks his own preference is most logical. No matter what you do it is a mess, just pick a convention and stick to it. We are trying to map a language with highly irregular grammar and semantics (normal spoken and written language) to a highly regular (SQL) grammar with very specific semantics.My main argument is that I don\'t think of the tables as a set but as relations. So, the AppUser relation tells which entities are AppUsers.The AppUserGroup relation tells me which entities are AppUserGroupsThe AppUser_AppUserGroup relation tells me how the AppUsers and AppUserGroups are related.The AppUserGroup_AppUserGroup relation tells me how AppUserGroups and AppUserGroups are related (i.e. groups member of groups).In other words, when I think about entities and how they are related I think of relations in singular, but of course, when I think of the entities in collections or sets, the collections or sets are plural.In my code, then, and in the database schema, I use singular. In textual descriptions, I end up using plural for increased readability - then use fonts etc. to distinguish the table/relation name from the plural s. I like to think of it as messy, but systematic - and this way there is always a systematically generated name for the relation I wish to express, which to me is very important.I also would go with plurals, and with the aforementioned Users dilemma, we do take the square bracketing approach.We do this to provide uniformity between both database architecture and application architecture, with the underlying understanding that the Users table is a collection of User values as much as a Users collection in a code artifact is a collection of User objects.Having our data team and our developers speaking the same conceptual language (although not always the same object names) makes it easier to convey ideas between them.Singular.  I\'d call an array containing a bunch of user row representation objects \'users\', but the table is \'the user table\'.  Thinking of the table as being nothing but the set of the rows it contains is wrong, IMO; the table is the metadata, and the set of rows is hierarchically attached to the table, it is not the table itself.I use ORMs all the time, of course, and it helps that ORM code written with plural table names looks stupid.I personaly prefer to use plural names to represent a set, it just "sounds" better to my relational mind.At this exact moment i am using singular names to define a data model for my company, because most of the people at work feel more confortable with it. \nSometimes you just have to make life easier to everyone instead of imposing your personal preferences.\n(that\'s how i ended up in this thread, to get a confirmation on what should be the "best practice" for naming tables)After reading all the arguing in this thread, i reached one conclusion:I like my pancakes with honey, no matter what everybody\'s favorite flavour is. But if i am cooking for other people, i will try to serve them something they like.IMHO, table names should be plural like Customers.Class names should be singular like Customer if it maps to a row in the Customers table.I don\'t like plural table names because some nouns in English are not countable (water, soup, cash) or the meaning changes when you make it countable (chicken vs a chicken; meat vs bird).\nI also dislike using abbreviations for table name or column name because doing so adds extra slope to the already steep learning curve.Ironically, I might make User an exception and call it Users because of USER (Transac-SQL), because I too don\'t like using brackets around tables if I don\'t have to.I also like to name all the ID columns as Id, not  ChickenId or ChickensId (what do plural guys do about this?).All this is because I don\'t have proper respect for the database systems, I am just reapplying one-trick-pony knowledge from OO naming conventions like Java\'s out of habit and laziness. I wish there were better IDE support for complicated SQL.We run similar standards, when scripting we demand [ ] around names, and where appropriate schema qualifiers - primarily it hedges your bets against future name grabs by the SQL syntax.  This has saved our souls in the past - some of our database systems have run 10+ years from SQL 6.0 through SQL 2005 - way past their intended lifespans.I\'ve actually always thought it was popular convention to use plural table names. Up until this point I\'ve always used plural.I can understand the argument for singular table names, but to me plural makes more sense. A table name usually describes what the table contains. In a normalized database, each table contains specific sets of data. Each row is an entity and the table contains many entities. Thus the plural form for the table name.A table of cars would have the name cars and each row is a car. I\'ll admit that specifying the table along with the field in a table.field manner is the best practice and that having singular table names is more readable. However in the following two examples, the former makes more sense:Honestly, I will be rethinking my position on the matter, and I would rely on the actual conventions used by the organization I\'m developing for. However, I think for my personal conventions, I\'ll stick with plural table names. To me it makes more sense.I am a fan of singular table names as they make my ER diagrams using CASE syntax easier to read, but by reading these responses I\'m getting the feeling it never caught on very well?  I personally love it.  There is a good overview with examples of how readable your models can be when you use singular table names, add action verbs to your relationships and form good sentences for every relationships.  It\'s all a bit of overkill for a 20 table database but if you have a DB with hundreds of tables and a complex design how will your developers ever understand it without a good readable diagram?http://www.aisintl.com/case/method.htmlAs for prefixing tables and views I absolutely hate that practice.  Give a person no information at all before giving them possibly bad information.  Anyone browsing a db for objects can quite easily tell a table from a view, but if I have a table named tblUsers that for some reason I decide to restructure in the future into two tables, with a view unifying them to keep from breaking old code I now have a view named tblUsers.  At this point I am left with two unappealing options, leave a view named with a tbl prefix which may confuse some developers, or force another layer, either middle tier or application to be rewritten to reference my new structure or name viewUsers.  That negates a large part of the value of views IMHO.This may be a bit redundant, but I would suggest being cautious.  Not necessarily that it\'s a bad thing to rename tables, but standardization is just that; a standard -- this database may already be "standardized", however badly :) -- I would suggest consistency to be a better goal given that this database already exists and presumably it consists of more than just 2 tables.Unless you can standardize the entire database, or at least are planning to work towards that end, I suspect that table names are just the tip of the iceberg and concentrating on the task at hand, enduring the pain of poorly named objects, may be in your best interest --Practical consistency sometimes is the best standard... :)my2cents ---Tables: pluralMultiple users are listed in the users table.Models: singularA singular user can be selected from the users table.Controllers: pluralhttp://myapp.com/users would list multiple users.That\'s my take on it anyway.As others have mentioned here, conventions should be a tool for adding to the ease of use and readability. Not as a shackle or a club to torture developers. That said, my personal preference is to use singular names for both tables and columns. This probably comes from my programming background. Class names are generally singular unless they are some sort of collection. In my mind I am storing or reading individual records in the table in question, so singular makes sense to me. This practice also allows me to reserve plural table names for those that store many-to-many relationships between my objects.I try to avoid reserved words in my table and column names, as well. In the case in question here it makes more sense to go counter to the singular convention for Users to avoid the need to encapsulate a table that uses the reserved word of User.I like using prefixes in a limited manner (tbl for table names, sp_ for proc names, etc), though many believe this adds clutter. I also prefer CamelBack names to underscores because I always end up hitting the + instead of _ when typing the name. Many others disagree.Here is another good link for naming convention guidelines: http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2008/10/26/the-power-of-a-good-sql-naming-convention/Remember that the most important factor in your convention is that it make sense to the people interacting with the database in question. There is no "One Ring to Rule Them All" when it comes to naming conventions.Possible alternatives:IMO using brackets is technically the safest approach, though it is a bit cumbersome.  IMO it\'s 6 of one, half-a-dozen of the other, and your solution really just boils down to personal/team preference.I think using the singular is what we were taught in university. But at the same time you could argue that unlike in object oriented programming, a table is not an instance of its records. I think I\'m tipping in favour of the singular at the moment because of plural irregularities in English. In German it\'s even worse due to no consistent plural forms - sometimes you cannot tell if a word is plural or not without the specifying article in front of it (der/die/das). And in Chinese languages there are no plural forms anyway.My take is in semantics depending on how you define your container. For example,  A "bag of apples" or simply "apples" or an "apple bag" or "apple". Example:\n    a "college" table can contain 0 or more colleges\n    a table of "colleges" can contain 0 or more colleguesMy conclusion is that either is fine but you have to define how you (or people interacting with it) are going to approach when referring to the tables; "a x table" or a "table of xs"I\'ve always used singular simply because that\'s what I was taught.  However, while creating a new schema recently, for the first time in a long time, I actively decided to maintain this convention simply because... it\'s shorter.  Adding an \'s\' to the end of every table name seems as useless to me as adding \'tbl_\' in front of every one.I once used "Dude" for the User table - same short number of characters, no conflict with keywords, still a reference to a generic human.  If I weren\'t concerned about the stuffy heads that might see the code, I would have kept it that way.I only use nouns for my table names that are spelled the same, whether singular or plural:moose\nfish\ndeer\naircraft\nyou\npants\nshorts\neyeglasses \nscissors\nspecies\noffspringIf we look at MS SQL Server\'s system tables, their names as assigned by Microsoft are in plural.The Oracle\'s system tables are named in singular. although a few of them are plural.\nOracle recommends plural for user-defined table names.\nThat doesn\'t make much sense that they recommend one thing and follow another.\nThat the architects at these two software giants have named their tables using different conventions, doesn\'t make much sense either... After all, what are these guys ... PhD\'s?I do remember in academia, the recommendation was singular.For example, when we say:select OrderHeader.ID FROM OrderHeader WHERE OrderHeader.Reference = \'ABC123\'maybe b/c each ID is selected from a particular single row ...?I will just give my opinion why I use singular names.For example, I need to get all the fields from an user:I need the name of the user that is 21 years old:Of course the plural way can be used by the same means, but for my brain to read, I really think that\'s the right way to go.I always thought that was a dumb convention.  I use plural table names.(I believe the rational behind that policy is that it make it easier for ORM code generators to produce object & collection classes, since it is easier to produce a plural name from a singular name than vice-versa)
