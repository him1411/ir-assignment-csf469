I spent most of the day yesterday searching for a clear answer for installing pip (package manager for Python). I can\'t find a good solution.How do I install it?All you need to do isYou can install it through Homebrew on OS X.  Why would you install Python with Homebrew?The version of Python that ships with OS X is great for learning but\n  it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for development. The version shipped with OS X may be\n  out of date from the official current Python release, which is\n  considered the stable production version. (source)Homebrew is something of a package manager for OS X.  Find more details on the Homebrew page.  Once Homebrew is installed, run the following to install the latest Python, Pip & Setuptools:TL;DR: All you have to do is:Details:\xe2\x9a\xa1\xef\xb8\x8f OK, I read the solutions given above, but here\'s an EASY solution to install pip. MacOS comes with Python installed. But to make sure that you have Python installed open the terminal and run the following command.If this command returns a version number that means Python exists. Which also means that you already have access to easy_install considering you are using macOS/OSX.\xe2\x84\xb9\xef\xb8\x8f Now, all you have to do is run the following command.After that, pip will be installed and you\'ll be able to use it for installing other packages.Let me know if you have any problems installing pip this way.Complimentary GIF.Cheers! P.S. I ended up blogging a post about it. QuickTip: How Do I Install pip on macOS or OS X?On Mac:Install easy_installInstall pipNow, you could install external modules. For examplepip is available on OS X via easy_install.\nOpen a terminal and type:When prompted for a password enter your normal login password.\nAfter the installation has completed you should be able to use pip as expected.   note: this works for other python packages tooThe simplest solution is to follow the installation instruction from pip\'s home site.Basically, this consists in:The main advantage of that solution is that it install pip for the python version that has been used to run get-pip.py, which means that if you use the default OS X installation of python to run get-pip.py you will install pip for the python install from the system.Most solutions that use a package manager (homebrew or macport) on OS X create a redundant installation of python in the environment of the package manager which can create inconsistencies in your system since, depending on what you are doing, you may call one installation of python instead of another.I\'m surprised no-one has mentioned this - it\'s a built-in way to install pip, without external tools or scripts:Works in pretty much the same way as easy_install, but worth knowing anyway.Installing a separate copy of Python is a popular option, even though Python already comes with MacOS. You take on the responsibility to make sure you\'re using the copy of Python you intend. But, the benefits are having the latest Python release and some protection from hosing your system if things go badly wrong.To install Python using HomeBrew:Now confirm that we\'re working with our newly installed Python:...should show a symbolic link to a path with "Cellar" in it like:Pip should be installed along with Python. You might want to upgrade it by typing:Now you\'re ready to install any of the 50,000+ packages on PyPI.Formerly, I\'ve used get-pip.py to install pip. But, the docs warn that get-pip.py does not coordinate with package managers and may leave your system in an inconsistent state. Anyway, there\'s no need, given that pip is now included with Python as of 2.7.9.Note that pip isn\'t the only package manager for Python. There\'s also easy_install. It\'s no good to mix the two, so don\'t do it.Finally, if you have both Python 2 and 3 installed, pip will point to whichever Python you installed last. Get in the habit of explicitly using either pip2 or pip3, so you\'re sure which Python is getting the new library.Happy hacking!NEW 2016 December: This worked for me on OSÂ X v10.11 (El Capitan):Mac comes with python 2, but not with pip.RequirementsSteps:curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.pysudo python get-pip.pyWith this I got these errors (but I\'ve solved them in step 3):The directory \'/Users/myuser/Library/Caches/pip/http\' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled.
