I was doing some work in my repository and noticed a file has local changes. I didn\'t want them anymore so I deleted the file, thinking I can just checkout a fresh copy. I wanted to do the git equivalent ofUsing git pull didn\'t seem to work. Some random searching led me to a site where someone recommended doing(src is the directory containing the deleted file). Now I find out I have a detached head. I have no idea what that is. How can I undo?Detached head means you are no longer on a branch, you have checked out a single commit in the history (in this case the commit previous to HEAD, i.e. HEAD^).You only need to checkout the branch you were on, e.g. Next time you have changed a file and want to restore it to the state it is in the index, don\'t delete the file first, just doThis will restore the file foo to the state it is in the index. If you have changed files you don\'t want to lose, you can push them. I have committed them in the detached mode and after that you can move to a temporary branch to integrate later in master.Extracted from: What to do with commit made in a detached headHow to exit (\xe2\x80\x9cfix\xe2\x80\x9d) detached HEAD state when you already changed something in this mode and want to save your changes. (That part is optional though.)Commit changes you want to keep. If you want to take over any of the changes you made in detached HEAD state, commit them. Like:Discard changes you do not want to keep. The hard reset will discard any uncommitted changes that you made in detached HEAD state:(Without this, step 3 would fail, complaining about modified uncommitted files in the detached HEAD.)Check out your branch. Exit detached HEAD state by checking out the branch you worked on before, for example:Take over your commits. You can now take over the commits you made in detached HEAD state by cherry-picking, as shown in my answer to another question.Detached head means: \n (1)  You are no longer on a branch, \n (2) You have checked out a single commit in the history\xc2\xa0if you have no changes: you can switch to master by applying the following commandif you have changes that you want to keep: In case of detached HEAD, commits work like normal, except no named branch gets updated.\xc2\xa0 To get master branch updated \nwith your committed changes, make a temporary branch where you are (this way the temporary branch will have all the committed changes you have made in the detached HEAD) , then switch to the master branch and merge the temporary branch with the master. Here\'s what I just did after I realized I was on a detached head and had already made some changes.I committed the changes.I remembered the hash (1fe56ad) of the commit. Then I checked out the branch I should have been on.Finally I applied the changes of the commit to the branch.I think this is a bit easier than creating a temporary branch.When you check out a specific commit in git, you end up in a detached head state...that is, your working copy no longer reflects the state of a named reference (like "master").  This is useful for examining the past state of the repository, but not what you want if you\'re actually trying to revert changes.If you have made changes to a particular file and you simply want to discard them, you can use the checkout command like this:This will discard any uncommitted changes and revert the file to whatever state it has in the head of your current branch.  If you want to discard changes that you have already committed, you may want to use the reset command.  For example, this will reset the repository to the state of the previous commit, discarding any subsequent changes:However, if you are sharing the repository with other people, a git reset can be disruptive (because it erases a portion of the repository history).  If you have already shared changes with other people, you generally want to look at git revert instead, which generates an "anticommit" -- that is, it creates a new commit that "undoes" the changes in question.The Git Book has more details.If you made some changes and then realized that you are on a detached head, there is a simple solution for that: stash -> checkout master -> stash pop:You will have your uncommited changes and normal "attached" HEAD, like nothing happened.Since "detached head state" has you on a temp branch, just use git checkout - which puts you on the last branch you were on.AddendumIf the branch to which you wish to return was the last checkout that you had made, you can simply use checkout @{-1}. This will take you back to your previous checkout. Further, you can alias this command with, for example, git global --config alias.prev so that you just need to type git prev to toggle back to the previous checkout.worked for me. It was just about giving remote and branch name explicitly.In my case, I run git status and I saw that I had a few untracked files on my working directory.I just had to clean them (since I didn\'t need them) to run the rebase I wanted to perform.You may need to clean your branch first to checkout master. -f forces the action.Then you will be able to checkout your mast branch like stated aboveTo get rid from Detached Head you need to know why this problem is arrived. Its Showing Detached Head because you merge your project several times(or atlas twice) by just committing your project locally. What you need to do is that by every time you merge your project just commit it locally as well as to server branch too.\nThis will resolve your problem as it does mine.Original answer on:\nDetached HEAD Issue in Android Studio
