When copying an array in JavaScript to another array:I realized that arr2 refers to the same array as arr1, rather than a new, independent array. How can I copy the array to get two independent arrays?Use this:Basically, the slice() operation clones the array and returns the reference to the new array.  Also note that:For references, strings and numbers (and not the actual object), slice copies object references into the new array. Both the original and new array refer to the same object. If a referenced object changes, the changes are visible to both the new and original arrays.Primitives such as strings and numbers are immutable so changes to the string or number are impossible. In Javascript, deep-copy techniques depend on the elements in an array.\nLet\'s start there.Elements can be: literal values, literal structures, or prototypes.From these elements we can create three types of arrays.Based on the types of elements in the array, we can use various techniques to deep copy.Array of literal-values (type1)\nThe myArray.splice(0), myArray.slice(), and myArray.concat() techniques can be used to deep copy arrays with literal values (boolean, number, and string) only; where Slice has higher performance than Concat (http://jsperf.com/duplicate-array-slice-vs-concat/3).Array of literal-values (type1) and literal-structures (type2)\nThe JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(myArray)) technique can be used to deep copy literal values (boolean, number, string) and literal structures (array, object), but not prototype objects.All arrays (type1, type2, type3)\nThe jQuery $.extend(myArray) technique can be used to deep-copy all array-types. Libraries like Underscore and Lo-dash offer similar deep-copy functions to jQuery $.extend(), yet have lower performance. More surprisingly, $.extend() has higher performance than the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(myArray)) technique http://jsperf.com/js-deep-copy/15.\nAnd for those developers that shy away from third-party libraries (like jQuery), you can use the following custom function; which has higher performance than $.extend, and deep-copies all arrays.Question I realized that arr2 refers to the same array as arr1, rather than a\n  new, independent array. How can I copy the array to get two\n  independent arrays?Answer Because arr1 is an array of literal values (boolean, number, or string), you can use any deep copy technique discussed above, where slice has the highest performance.No jQuery needed...  Working ExampleThis copys the array from the starting position 0 through the end of the array.It is important to note that it will work as expected for primitive types (string, number, etc.), and to also explain the expected behavior for reference types...If you have an array of Reference types, say of type Object.  The array will be copied, but both of the arrays will contain references to the same Object\'s.  So in this case it would seem like the array is copied by reference even though the array is actually copied.An alternative to slice is concat, which can be used in 2 ways. The first of these is perhaps more readable as the intended behaviour is very clear:The second method is:Cohen (in the comments) pointed out that this latter method has better performance.The way this works is that the concat method creates a new array consisting of the elements in the object on which it is called followed by the elements of any arrays passed to it as arguments. So when no arguments are passed, it simply copies the array.Lee Penkman, also in the comments, points out that if there\'s a chance array1 is undefined, you can return an empty array as follows:Or, for the second method:Note that you can also do this with slice: var array2 = (array1 || []).slice();.You can use array spreads ... to copy arrays.const itemsCopy = [...items];Also if want to create a new array with the existing one being part of it:Array spreads are now supported in all major browsers but if you need older support use typescript or babel and compile to ES5.More info on spreadsThis is how I\'ve done it after trying many approaches:This will create a new deep copy not related to the first one (not a shallow copy).Also this obviously will not clone events and functions, but the good thing you can do it in one line, and it can be used for any kind of object (arrays, strings, numbers, objects ...)Some of mentioned methods work well when working with simple data types like number or string, but when the array contains other objects these methods fail. When we try to pass any object from one array to another it is passed as a reference, not the object.Add the following code in your JavaScript file:And simply useIt will work.From ES2015,Adding to the solution of array.slice(); be aware that if you have multidimensional array sub-arrays will be copied by references.\nWhat you can do is to loop and slice() each sub-array individually  same things goes to array of objects, they will be copied by reference, you have to copy them manuallyIf you are in an environment of ECMAScript 6, using the Spread Operator you could do it this way:I personally think Array.from is a more readable solution. By the way, just beware of its browser support.In my particular case I needed to ensure the array remained intact so this worked for me:Make copy of multidimensional array/object:Thanks to James Padolsey for this function.Source: HereIf you want to make a new copy of an object or array, you must explicitly copy the properties of the object or the elements of the array, for example:You can search for more information on Google about immutable primitive values and mutable object references.You can also use ES6 spread operator to copy ArrayAs we know Javascript arrays and objects are by reference, but what ways we can do copy the array without changing the original array later one? Here are few ways to do it:Imagine we have this array in your code:1) Looping through the array in a function and return a new array, like this:2) Using slice method, slice is for slicing part of the array, it will slice some part of your array without touching the original, in the slice, if don\'t specify the start and end of the array, it will slice the whole array and basically make a full copy of the array, so we can easily say:3) Also contact method, this is for merging two array, but we can just specify one of arrays and then this basically make a copy of the values in the new contacted array:4) Also stringify and parse method, it\'s not recommended, but can be an easy way to copy Array and Objects:5) Array.from method, this is not widely supported, before use check the support in different browsers:6) ECMA6 way, also not fully supported, but babelJs can help you if you want to transpile:Here\'s a variant:Using jQuery deep copy could be made as following:There\'s the newly introduced Array.from, but unfortunately, as of the time of this writing it\'s only supported on recent Firefox versions (32 and higher). It can be simply used as follows:Reference: HereOr Array.prototype.map may be used with an identity function:Reference: Here
