Is there a null coalescing operator in Javascript?For example, in C#, I can do this:The best approximation I can figure out for Javascript is using the conditional operator:Which is sorta icky IMHO. Can I do better?The JavaScript equivalent of the C# null coalescing operator (??) is using a logical OR (||):There are cases (clarified below) that the behaviour won\'t match that of C#, but this is the general, terse way of assigning default/alternative values in JavaScript.Regardless of the type of the first operand, if casting it to a Boolean results in false, the assignment will use the second operand. Beware of all the cases below:This means:this solution works like the SQL coalesce function, it accepts any number of arguments, and returns null if none of them have a value.  It behaves like the C# ?? operator in the sense that "", false, and 0 are considered NOT NULL and therefore count as actual values.  If you come from a .net background, this will be the most natural feeling solution.If || as a replacement of C#\'s ?? isn\'t good enough in your case, because it swallows empty strings and zeros, you can always write your own function:Nobody has mentioned in here the potential for NaN, which--to me--is also a null-ish value. So, I thought I\'d add my two-cents.For the given code:If you were to use the || operator, you get the first non-false value:If you use the typical coalesce method, as posted here, you will get c, which has the value: NaNNeither of these seem right to me.  In my own little world of coalesce logic, which may differ from your world, I consider undefined, null, and NaN as all being "null-ish".  So, I would expect to get back d (zero) from the coalesce method.If anyone\'s brain works like mine, and you want to exclude NaN, then this method will accomplish that:For those who want the code as short as possible, and don\'t mind a little lack of clarity, you can also use this as suggested by @impinball. This takes advantage of the fact that NaN is never equal to NaN.  You can read up more on that here: Why is NaN not equal to NaN?beware of the JavaScript specific definition of null. there are two definitions for "no value" in javascript.\n1. Null: when a variable is null, it means it contains no data in it, but the variable is already defined in the code. like this:in such case, the type of your variable is actually Object. test it.Undefined: when a variable has not been defined before in the code, and as expected, it does not contain any value. like this:if such case, the type of your variable is \'undefined\'.notice that if you use the type-converting comparison operator (==), JavaScript will act equally for both of these empty-values. to distinguish between them, always use the type-strict comparison operator (===).After reading your clarification, @Ates Goral\'s answer provides how to perform the same operation you\'re doing in C# in JavaScript.@Gumbo\'s answer provides the best way to check for null; however, it\'s important to note the difference in == versus === in JavaScript especially when it comes to issues of checking for undefined and/or null.There\'s a really good article about the difference in two terms here. Basically, understand that if you use == instead of ===, JavaScript will try to coalesce the values you\'re comparing and return what the result of the comparison after this coalescence. Currently no support, but the JS-standardization process is working on it: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining
