How can I determine whether a variable is a string or something else in JavaScript?You can use typeof operator:Example from this webpage. (Example was slightly modified though).Here\'s reference for typeof operator.This is what works for me:I recommend using the built-in functions from jQuery or lodash/Underscore.  They\'re simpler to use and easier to read.Either function will handle the case DRAX mentioned...  that is, they both check if (A) the variable is a string literal or (B) it\'s an instance of the String object.  In either case, these functions correctly identify the value as being a string.lodash / Underscore.jsjQuerySee lodash Documentation for _.isString() for more details.See jQuery Documentation for $.type() for more details.Since 580+ people have voted for an incorrect answer, and 800+ have voted for a working but shotgun-style answer, I thought it might be worth redoing my answer in a simpler form that everybody can understand.Or, inline (I have an UltiSnip setup for this):FYI, Pablo Santa Cruz\'s answer is wrong, because typeof new String("string") is objectDRAX\'s answer is accurate and functional, and should be the correct answer (since Pablo Santa Cruz is most definitely incorrect, and I won\'t argue against the popular vote.)However, this answer is also definitely correct, and actually the best answer (except, perhaps, for the suggestion of using lodash/underscore). disclaimer: I contributed to the lodash 4 codebase.My original answer (which obviously flew right over a lot of heads) follows: I transcoded this from underscore.js:That will define isString, isNumber, etc.PS. If someone could rewrite that to work in non-browser contexts (e.g. node.js)?I saw that here:http://perfectionkills.com/instanceof-considered-harmful-or-how-to-write-a-robust-isarray/You can use this open source reusable is-string component to check if a var is a string while avoiding copy-pasting it.Examples:Also, here is how isString was implemented in AngularJS:Best way:Each of these has been constructed by its appropriate class function, like "new Object()" etc.Also, Duck-Typing:\n"If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and smells like a duck - it must be an Array"\nMeaning, check its properties.Hope this helps.Remember, you can always use combinations of approaches too. Here\'s an example of using an inline map of actions with typeof:Here\'s a more \'real world\' example of using inline-maps:This function would use [ custom ] "type-casting" -- rather, "type-/-value-mapping" -- to figure out if a variable actually "exists". Now you can split that nasty hair between null & 0!Many times you don\'t even care about its type. Another way to circumvent typing is combining Duck-Type sets:Both Number.prototype and String.prototype have a .toString() method. You just made sure that the string-equivalent of the number was the same, and then you made sure that you passed it into the http function as a Number. In other words, we didn\'t even care what its type was.Hope that gives you more to work with :)A simple solution would be:Taken from lodash:If you work on the node.js environment, you can simply use the built-in function isString in utils.Edit: as @Jehy mentioned, this is deprecated since v4.I also found that this works fine too, and its a lot shorter than the other examples.By concatenating on empty quotes it turns the value into a string. If myVar is already a string then the if statement is successful.Just to expand on @DRAX\'s answer, I\'d do this:It will account also for nulls and undefined types, and it will take care of non-string types, such as 0.Here is the Complete solution which, not only gives you basic util function to find out if value is String object or anything else. \nPlus some other good to have functions.  this raw file is used in my this simple react redux project on github\nSimple React Redux The above code will Create a Object Sys = {}\n  this method has all the functions like getType, isDefined \n  To use them simply check call this method like this. This is a simple trick.\n"using charAt"you can use charAt to every string format and others are false. But null causes errors.I\'m not sure if you mean knowing if it\'s a type string regardless of its contents, or whether it\'s contents is a number or string, regardless of its type.\nSo to know if its type is a string, that\'s already been answered.\n\nBut to know based on its contents if its a string or a number, I would use this:And for some examples:
