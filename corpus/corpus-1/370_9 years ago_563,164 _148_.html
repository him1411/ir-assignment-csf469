What is the main difference between an inner class and a static nested class in Java? Does design / implementation play a role in choosing one of these?From the Java Tutorial:Nested classes are divided into two categories: static and non-static. Nested classes that are declared static are simply called static nested classes. Non-static nested classes are called inner classes. Static nested classes are accessed using the enclosing class name:For example, to create an object for the static nested class, use this syntax:Objects that are instances of an inner class exist within an instance of the outer class. Consider the following classes:An instance of InnerClass can exist only within an instance of OuterClass and has direct access to the methods and fields of its enclosing instance.To instantiate an inner class, you must first instantiate the outer class. Then, create the inner object within the outer object with this syntax:see: Java Tutorial - Nested ClassesFor completeness note that there is also such a thing as an inner class without an enclosing instance:Here, new A() { ... } is an inner class defined in a static context and does not have an enclosing instance.The Java tutorial says:Terminology: Nested classes are\n  divided into two categories: static\n  and non-static. Nested classes that\n  are declared static are simply called\n  static nested classes. Non-static\n  nested classes are called inner\n  classes.In common parlance, the terms "nested" and "inner" are used interchangeably by most programmers, but I\'ll use the correct term "nested class" which covers both inner and static.Classes can be nested ad infinitum, e.g. class A can contain class B which contains class C which contains class D, etc. However, more than one level of class nesting is rare, as it is generally bad design.There are three reasons you might create a nested class:There are four kinds of nested class in Java. In brief, they are:Let me elaborate in more details.Static classes are the easiest kind to understand because they have nothing to do with instances of the containing class.A static class is a class declared as a static member of another class. Just like other static members, such a class is really just a hanger on that uses the containing class as its namespace, e.g. the class Goat declared as a static member of class Rhino in the package pizza is known by the name pizza.Rhino.Goat.Frankly, static classes are a pretty worthless feature because classes are already divided into namespaces by packages. The only real conceivable reason to create a static class is that such a class has access to its containing class\'s private static members, but I find this to be a pretty lame justification for the static class feature to exist.An inner class is a class declared as a non-static member of another class:Like with a static class, the inner class is known as qualified by its containing class name, pizza.Rhino.Goat, but inside the containing class, it can be known by its simple name. However, every instance of an inner class is tied to a particular instance of its containing class: above, the Goat created in jerry, is implicitly tied to the Rhino instance this in jerry. Otherwise, we make the associated Rhino instance explicit when we instantiate Goat:(Notice you refer to the inner type as just Goat in the weird new syntax: Java infers the containing type from the rhino part. And, yes new rhino.Goat() would have made more sense to me too.)So what does this gain us? Well, the inner class instance has access to the instance members of the containing class instance. These enclosing instance members are referred to inside the inner class via just their simple names, not via this (this in the inner class refers to the inner class instance, not the associated containing class instance): In the inner class, you can refer to this of the containing class as Rhino.this, and you can use this to refer to its members, e.g. Rhino.this.barry.A local inner class is a class declared in the body of a method. Such a class is only known within its containing method, so it can only be instantiated and have its members accessed within its containing method. The gain is that a local inner class instance is tied to and can access the final local variables of its containing method. When the instance uses a final local of its containing method, the variable retains the value it held at the time of the instance\'s creation, even if the variable has gone out of scope (this is effectively Java\'s crude, limited version of closures).Because a local inner class is neither the member of a class or package, it is not declared with an access level. (Be clear, however, that its own members have access levels like in a normal class.)If a local inner class is declared in an instance method, an instantiation of the inner class is tied to the instance held by the containing method\'s this at the time of the instance\'s creation, and so the containing class\'s instance members are accessible like in an instance inner class. A local inner class is instantiated simply via its name, e.g. local inner class Cat is instantiated as new Cat(), not new this.Cat() as you might expect.An anonymous inner class is a syntactically convenient way of writing a local inner class. Most commonly, a local inner class is instantiated at most just once each time its containing method is run. It would be nice, then, if we could combine the local inner class definition and its single instantiation into one convenient syntax form, and it would also be nice if we didn\'t have to think up a name for the class (the fewer unhelpful names your code contains, the better). An anonymous inner class allows both these things:This is an expression returning a new instance of an unnamed class which extends ParentClassName. You cannot supply your own constructor; rather, one is implicitly supplied which simply calls the super constructor, so the arguments supplied must fit the super constructor. (If the parent contains multiple constructors, the \xe2\x80\x9csimplest\xe2\x80\x9d one is called, \xe2\x80\x9csimplest\xe2\x80\x9d as determined by a rather complex set of rules not worth bothering to learn in detail--just pay attention to what NetBeans or Eclipse tell you.)Alternatively, you can specify an interface to implement:Such a declaration creates a new instance of an unnamed class which extends Object and implements InterfaceName. Again, you cannot supply your own constructor; in this case, Java implicitly supplies a no-arg, do-nothing constructor (so there will never be constructor arguments in this case).Even though you can\'t give an anonymous inner class a constructor, you can still do any setup you want using an initializer block (a {} block placed outside any method).Be clear that an anonymous inner class is simply a less flexible way of creating a local inner class with one instance. If you want a local inner class which implements multiple interfaces or which implements interfaces while extending some class other than Object or which specifies its own constructor, you\'re stuck creating a regular named local inner class.I don\'t think the real difference became clear in the above answers. First to get the terms right: Martin\'s answer is right so far. However, the actual question is: What is the purpose of declaring a nested class static or not?You use static nested classes if you just want to keep your classes together if they belong topically together or if the nested class is exclusively used in the enclosing class. There is no semantic difference between a static nested class and every other class.Non-static nested classes are a different beast. Similar to anonymous inner classes, such nested classes are actually closures. That means they capture their surrounding scope and their enclosing instance and make that accessible. Perhaps an example will clarify that. See this stub of a Container:In this case you want to have a reference from a child item to the parent container. Using a non-static nested class, this works without some work. You can access the enclosing instance of Container with the syntax Container.this.More hardcore explanations following:If you look at the Java bytecodes the compiler generates for an (non-static) nested class it might become even clearer:As you can see the compiler creates a hidden field Container this$0. This is set in the constructor which has an additional parameter of type Container to specify the enclosing instance. You can\'t see this parameter in the source but the compiler implicitly generates it for a nested class. Martin\'s examplewould so be compiled to a call of something like (in bytecodes)For the sake of completeness:An anonymous class is a perfect example of a non-static nested class which just has no name associated with it and can\'t be referenced later.I think that none of the above answers explain to you the real difference between a nested class and a static nested class in term of application design : A nested class could be nonstatic or static and in each case is a class defined within another class. A nested class should exist only to serve is enclosing class, if a nested class is useful by other classes (not only the enclosing), should be declared as a top level class.Nonstatic Nested class : is implicitly associated with the enclosing instance of the containing class, this means that it is possible to invoke methods and access variables of the enclosing instance. One common use of a nonstatic nested class is to define an Adapter class.Static Nested Class : can\'t access enclosing class instance and invoke methods on it, so should be used when the nested class doesn\'t require access to an instance of the enclosing class . A common use of static nested class is to implement a components of the outer object.So the main difference between the two from a design standpoint is : nonstatic nested class can access instance of the container class, while static can\'t.In simple terms we need nested classes primarily because Java does not provide closures.Nested Classes are classes defined inside the body of another enclosing class. They are of two types - static and non-static.They are treated as members of the enclosing class, hence you can specify any of the four access specifiers - private, package, protected, public. We don\'t have this luxury with top-level classes, which can only be declared public or package-private.Inner classes aka Non-stack classes have access to other members of the top class, even if they are declared private while Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the top class.Inner1 is our static inner class and Inner2 is our inner class which is not static. The key difference between them, you can\'t create an Inner2 instance without an Outer where as you can create an Inner1 object independently.When would you use Inner class?Think of a situation where Class A and Class B are related, Class B needs to access Class A members, and Class B is related only to Class A. Inner classes comes into the picture.For creating an instance of inner class, you need to create an instance of your outer class.orWhen would you use static Inner class?You would define a static inner class when you know that it does not have any relationship with the instance of the enclosing class/top class. If your inner class doesn\'t use methods or fields of the outer class, it\'s just a waste of space, so make it static.For example, to create an object for the static nested class, use this syntax:The advantage of a static nested class is that it doesn\'t need an object of the containing class/top class to work. This can help you to reduce the number of objects your application creates at runtime.I think, the convention that is generally followed is this:However, few other points to remembers are:Top level classes and static nested class are semantically same except that in case of static nested class it can make static reference to private static fields/methods of its Outer [parent] class and vice versa.Inner classes have access to instance variables of the enclosing instance of the Outer [parent] class. However, not all inner classes have enclosing instances, for example inner classes in static contexts, like an anonymous class used in a static initializer block, do not.Anonymous class by default extends the parent class or implements the parent interface and there is no further clause to extend any other class or implement any more interfaces. So,I feel that the bigger question that remains open which one to use and when? Well that mostly depends on what scenario you are dealing with but reading the reply given by @jrudolph may help you making some decision.Here is key differences and similarities between Java inner class and static nested class.Hope it helps!Associated with instance of enclosing class so to instantiate it first needs an instance of outer class (note new keyword place):Cannot define any static members itselfCannot access outer class instance methods or fieldsNot associated with any instance of enclosing class So to instantiate it:According to Oracle documentation there\'re several reasons (full documentation):It is a way of logically grouping classes that are only used in one place: If a class is useful to only one other class, then it is logical to embed it in that class and keep the two together. Nesting such "helper classes" makes their package more streamlined.It increases encapsulation: Consider two top-level classes, A and B, where B needs access to members of A that would otherwise be declared private. By hiding class B within class A, A\'s members can be declared private and B can access them. In addition, B itself can be hidden from the outside world.It can lead to more readable and maintainable code: Nesting small classes within top-level classes places the code closer to where it is used.Nested class: class inside classTypes:Difference:Non-static nested class [Inner class]In non-static nested class object of inner class exist within object of outer class. So that data member of outer class is accessible to inner class. So to create object of inner class we must create object of outer class first.Static nested classIn static nested class object of inner class don\'t need object of outer class, because the word "static" indicate no need to create object.If you want to access x, then write the following inside methodThe instance of the inner class is created when instance of the outer class is created. Therefore the members and methods of the inner class have access to the members and methods of the instance (object) of the outer class. When the instance of the outer class goes out of scope, also the inner class instances cease to exist.The static nested class doesn\'t have a concrete instance. It\'s just loaded when it\'s used for the first time (just like the static methods). It\'s a completely independent entity, whose methods and variables doesn\'t have any access to the instances of the outer class.The static nested classes are not coupled with the outer object, they are faster, and they don\'t take heap/stack memory, because its not necessary to create instance of such class. Therefore the rule of thumb is to try to define static nested class, with as limited scope as possible (private >= class >= protected >= public), and then convert it to inner class (by removing "static" identifier) and loosen the scope, if it\'s really necessary.The terms are used interchangeably.  If you want to be really pedantic about it, then you could define "nested class" to refer to a static inner class, one which has no enclosing instance.  In code, you might have something like this:That\'s not really a widely accepted definition though.There is a subtlety about the use of nested static classes that might be useful in certain situations.Whereas static attributes get instantiated before the class gets instantiated via its constructor,\nstatic attributes inside of nested static classes don\'t seem to get instantiated until after the\nclass\'s constructor gets invoked, or at least not until after the attributes are first referenced,\neven if they are marked as \'final\'.Consider this example:Even though \'nested\' and \'innerItem\' are both declared as \'static final\'. the setting\nof nested.innerItem doesn\'t take place until after the class is instantiated (or at least\nnot until after the nested static item is first referenced), as you can see for yourself\nby commenting and uncommenting the lines that I refer to, above. The same does not hold\ntrue for \'outerItem\'.At least this is what I\'m seeing in Java 6.0.In the case of creating instance, the instance of non \nstatic inner class is created with the reference of\nobject of outer class in which it is defined. This\nmeans it have inclosing instance.\nBut the instance of static inner class\nis created with the reference of Outer class, not with\nthe reference of object of outer class. This means it\nhave not inclosing instance.For example:Nested class is a very general term: every class which is not top level is a nested class.\nAn inner class is a non-static nested class.\nJoseph Darcy wrote a very nice explanation about Nested, Inner, Member, and Top-Level Classes.Ummm... an inner class IS a nested class... do you mean anonymous class and inner class?Edit:  If you actually meant inner vs anonymous... an inner class is just a class defined within a class such as:Whereas an anonymous class is an extension of a class defined anonymously, so no actual "class is defined, as in:Further Edit:Wikipedia claims there is a difference in Java, but I\'ve been working with Java for 8 years, and it\'s the first I heard such a distinction... not to mention there are no references there to back up the claim... bottom line, an inner class is a class defined within a class (static or not), and nested is just another term to mean the same thing.There is a subtle difference between static and non-static nested class... basically non-static inner classes have implicit access to instance fields and methods of the enclosing class (thus they cannot be constructed in a static context, it will be a compiler error).  Static nested classes, on the other hand, don\'t have implicit access to instance fields and methods, and CAN be constructed in a static context.Targeting learner, who are novice to Java and/or Nested Classes Nested classes can be either:\n 1. Static Nested classes.\n 2. Non Static Nested classes. (also known as Inner classes) =>Please remember this\n1.Inner classes\nExample:Inner classes are subsets of nested classes:Specialty of Inner class:\n2.Static Nested Classes:\nExample:Case 1:Instantiating a static nested class from a non-enclosing classCase 2:Instantiating a static nested class from an enclosing classSpecialty of Static classes:Conclusion:\nQuestion: What is the main difference between a inner class and a static nested class in Java?\nAnswer: just go through specifics of each class mentioned above.I don\'t think there is much to add here, most of the answers perfectly explain the differences between static nested class and Inner classes. However, consider the following issue when using nested classes vs inner classes. \nAs mention in a couple of answers inner classes can not be instantiated without and instance of their enclosing class which mean that they HOLD a pointer to the instance of their enclosing class which can lead to memory overflow or stack overflow exception due to the fact the GC will not be able to garbage collect the enclosing classes even if they are not used any more. To make this clear check the following code out: If you remove the comment on // inner = null; The program will out put \n"I am destroyed !", but keeping this commented it will not.\nThe reason is that white inner instance is still referenced GC cannot collect it and because it references (has a pointer to) the outer instance it is not collected too. Having enough of these objects in your project and can run out of memory.\nCompared to static inner classes which does not hold a point to inner class instance because it is not instance related but class related. \nThe above program can print "I am destroyed !" if you make Inner class static and instantiated with Outer.Inner i = new Outer.Inner(); Inner class and nested static class in Java both are classes declared inside another class, known as top level class in Java. In Java terminology, If you declare a nested class static, it will called nested static class in Java while non static nested class are simply referred as Inner Class. What is Inner Class in Java?Any class which is not a top level or declared inside another class is known as nested class and out of those nested classes, class which are declared non static are known as Inner class in Java. there are three kinds of Inner class in Java:1) Local inner class    - is declared inside a code block or method.\n2) Anonymous inner class - is a class which doesn\'t have name to reference and initialized at same place where it gets created.\n3) Member inner class - is declared as non static member of outer class.What is nested static class in Java?Nested static class is another class which is declared inside a class as member and made static. Nested static class is also declared as member of outer class and can be make private, public or protected like any other member. One of the main benefit of nested static class over inner class is that instance of nested static class is not attached to any enclosing instance of Outer class. You also don\'t need any instance of Outer class to create instance of nested static class in Java.1) It can access static data members of outer class including private.\n2) Static nested class cannot access non-static (instance) data member or method.Ref: Inner class and nested Static Class in Java with ExampleI think people here should notice to Poster that : Static Nest Class just only the first inner class.\nFor example:So, summarize, static class doesn\'t depend which class its contains. So, they cannot in normal class. (because normal class need an instance).When we declare static member class inside a class, it is known as top level nested class or a static nested class. It can be demonstrated as below : When we declare non-static member class inside a class it is known as inner class. Inner class can be demonstrated as below : The following is an example of static nested class and inner class:OuterClass.javaOuterClassTest:The difference is that a nested class declaration that is also static can be instantiated outside of the enclosing class.When you have a nested class declaration that is not static, also known as an inner class, Java won\'t let you instantiate it except via the enclosing class. The object created out of the inner class is linked to the object created from the outer class, so the inner class can reference the fields of the outer.But if it\'s static, then the link does not exist, the outer fields cannot be accessed (except via an ordinary reference like any other object) and you can therefore instantiate the nested class by itself.First of all There is no such class called Static class.The Static modifier use with inner class (called as Nested Class) says that it is a static member of Outer Class which means we can access it as with other static members and without having any instance of Outer class. (Which is benefit of static originally.) Difference between using Nested class and regular Inner class is:First We can to instantiate Outerclass then we Can access Inner.But if Class is Nested then syntax is:Which uses the static Syntax as normal implementation of static keyword.
