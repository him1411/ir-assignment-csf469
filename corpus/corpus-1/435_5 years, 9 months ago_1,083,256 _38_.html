In Bash, tried this:But it doesn\'t print a newline, only \\n. How can I make it print the newline?I\'m using Ubuntu 11.04.You could use printf instead:printf has more consistent behavior than echo. The behavior of echo varies greatly between different versions.Are you sure you are in bash? Works for me, all three ways:prints$\'\' strings use ANSI C Quoting:Words of the form $\'string\' are treated specially. The word expands to string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard.You could always do echo "".e.g.In the off chance that someone finds themselves beating their head against the wall trying to figure out why a coworker\'s script won\'t print newlines, look out for this ->As in the above, the actual running of the method may itself be wrapped in an echo which supersedes any echos that may be in the method itself.  Obviously I watered this down for brevity, it was not so easy to spot!You can then inform your comrades that a better way to execute functions would be like so:This works for me in raspbian,echo -e "hello\\\\nworld"POSIX 7 on echohttp://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/echo.html-e is not defined and backslashes are implementation defined:If the first operand is -n, or if any of the operands contain a <backslash> character, the results are implementation-defined. unless you have an optional XSI extension.So use printf instead:format operand shall be used as the format string described in XBD File Format Notation [...]the File Format Notation:\\n <newline> Move the printing position to the start of the next line.Also keep in mind that Ubuntu 15.10 and most distros implement echo both as:which can lead to some confusion.One more entry here for those that didn\'t make it work with any of these solutions, and need to get a return value from their function:Only this trick worked in a linux I was working on with this bash:Hope it helps someone with similar problem.My script:Output:On my bash script I was getting mad as you until I\'ve just tried:Just hit enter where you want to insert that jump. Output now is:You could also use echo with braces,This could better be done as-e option will interpret backslahes for the escape sequence\n-n option will remove the trailing newline in the outputPS: the command echo has an effect of always including a trailing newline in the output so -n is required to turn that thing off (and make it less confusing)
