or Which is the standard way? And, conversely, how do you enable a disabled input?To change the disabled property you should use the .prop() function.The .prop() function doesn\'t exist, but .attr() does similar:Set the disabled attribute.To enable again, the proper method is to use .removeAttr()You can always rely on the actual DOM object and is probably a little faster than the other two options if you are only dealing with one element:The advantage to using the .prop() or .attr() methods is that you can set the property for a bunch of selected items.Note: In 1.6 there is a .removeProp() method that sounds a lot like removeAttr(), but it SHOULD NOT BE USED on native properties like \'disabled\'  Excerpt from the documentation:Note: Do not use this method to remove native properties such as checked, disabled, or selected. This will remove the property completely and, once removed, cannot be added again to element. Use .prop() to set these properties to false instead.In fact, I doubt there are many legitimate uses for this method, boolean props are done in such a way that you should set them to false instead of "removing" them like their "attribute" counterparts in 1.5Just for the sake of new conventions && making it adaptable going forward (unless things change drastically with ECMA6(????):andSometimes you need to disable/enable the form element like input or textarea. Jquery helps you to easily make this with setting disabled attribute to "disabled".\nFor e.g.:To enable disabled element you need to remove "disabled" attribute from this element or empty it\'s string.
