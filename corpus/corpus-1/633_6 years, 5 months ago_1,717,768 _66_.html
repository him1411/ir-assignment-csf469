What is the easiest way to convert from int to equivalent string in C++.  I am aware of two methods. Is there any easier way?1.2.C++11 introduces std::stoi (and variants for each numeric type) and std::to_string, the counterparts of the C atoi and itoa but expressed in term of std::string.is therefore the shortest way I can think of.Note: see [string.conversions] (21.5 in n3242)Since "converting ... to string" is a recurring problem, I always define the SSTR() macro in a central header of my C++ sources:Usage is as easy as could be:The above is C++98 compatible (if you cannot use C++11 std::to_string), and does not need any third-party includes (if you cannot use Boost lexical_cast<>); both these other solutions have a better performance though.I usually use the following method:described in details here.Probably the most common easy way wraps essentially your second choice into a template named lexical_cast, such as the one in Boost, so your code looks like this:One nicety of this is that it supports other casts as well (e.g., in the opposite direction works just as well).Also note that although Boost lexical_cast started out as just writing to a stringstream, then extracting back out of the stream, it now has a couple of additions. First of all, specializations for quite a few types have been added, so for many common types, it\'s substantially faster than using a stringstream. Second, it now checks the result, so (for example) if you convert from a string to an int, it can throw an exception if the string contains something that couldn\'t be converted to an int (e.g., 1234 would succeed, but 123abc would throw).As of C++11, there\'s a std::to_string function overloaded for integer types, so you can use code like:The standard defines these as being equivalent to doing the conversion with sprintf (using the conversion specifier that matches the supplied type of object, such as %d for int), into a buffer of sufficient size, then creating an std::string of the contents of that buffer.If you have Boost installed (which you should):Wouldn\'t it be easier using stringstreams?Or make a function:Not that I know of, in pure C++. But a little modification of what you mentionedshould work, and it\'s pretty short.sprintf() is pretty good for format conversion. You can then assign the resulting C string to the C++ string as you did in 1.First include:Second add the method:Use the method like this:orYou can use std::to_string available in C++11 as suggested by Matthieu M.:Or, if performance is critical (for example, if you do lots of conversions), you can use fmt::FormatInt from the C++ Format library to convert an integer to std::string:Or a C string:The latter doesn\'t do any dynamic memory allocations and is more than 10 times faster than std::to_string on Boost Karma benchmarks. See Fast integer to string conversion in C++ for more details.Unlike std::to_string, fmt::FormatInt doesn\'t require C++11 and works with any C++ compiler.Disclaimer: I\'m the author of the C++ Format library.you can now use to_string(5)For C++98, there\'s a few options:Boost is not a part of the C++ library, but contains many useful library extensions.The lexical_cast function template offers a convenient and consistent form for supporting common conversions to and from arbitrary types when they are represented as text.  \n  -- Boost\'s Documentation As for runtime, the lexical_cast operation takes about 80 microseconds (on my machine) on the first conversion, and then speeds up considerably afterwards if done redundantly.This function is not defined in ANSI-C and is not part of C++, but is supported by some compilers. \n  -- cplusplus.comThis means that gcc/g++ cannot compile code using itoa.No runtime to report. I don\'t have Visual Studio installed, which is reportedly able to compile itoa.sprintf is a C standard library function that works on C strings, and is a perfectly valid alternative.Composes a string with the same text that would be printed if format was used on printf, but instead of being printed, the content is stored as a C string in the buffer pointed by str. \n  -- cplusplus.comThe stdio.h header may not be necessary. As for runtime, the sprintf operation takes about 40 microseconds (on my machine) on the first conversion, and then speeds up considerably afterwards if done redundantly.This is the C++ library\'s main way of converting integers to strings, and vice versa. There are similar sister functions to stringstream that further limit the intended use of the stream, such as ostringstream. Using ostringstream specifically tells the reader of your code that you only intend to use the << operator, essentially. This function is all that\'s particularly necessary to convert an integer to a string. See this question for a more elaborate discussion.As for runtime, the ostringstream operation takes about 71 microseconds (on my machine), and then speeds up considerably afterwards if done redundantly, but not by as much as the previous functions.Of course there are other options, and you can even wrap one of these into your own function, but this offers an analytical look at some of the popular ones.I use:It works on my windows and linux g++ compilers. Using CString:Use:Using stringstream for number conversion is dangerous!See http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ostream/ostream/operator%3C%3C/ where it tells that operator<< inserts formatted output.Depending on your current locale an integer greater than 3 digits, could convert to a string of 4 digits, adding an extra thousands separator.E.g., int = 1000 could be convertet to a string 1.001. This could make comparison operations not work at all.So I would strongly recommend using the std::to_string way. It is easier and does what you expect.If you need fast conversion of an integer with a fixed number of digits to char* left-padded with \'0\', this is a convenient example:If you are converting a two-digit number:If you are converting a three-digit number:If you are converting a four-digit number:And so on up to seven-digit numbers :)You use a counter type of algorithm to convert to a string. I got this technique from programming Commodore 64 computers. It is also good for game programming.You take the integer and take each digit that is weighted by powers of 10. So assume the integer is 950.If the integer equals or is greater than 100,000 then subtract 100,000 and increase the counter in the string at ["000000"];  \nkeep doing it until no more numbers in position 100,000.\nDrop another power of tenIf the integer equals or is greater than 10,000 then subtract 10,000 and increase the counter in the string at ["000000"] + 1 position; \nkeep doing it until no more numbers in position 10,000.Drop another power of tenI know 950 is too small to use as an example but I hope you get the idea.
