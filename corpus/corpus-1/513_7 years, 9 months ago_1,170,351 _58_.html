I want to make a symbolic link in Linux.  I have written this bash command where the first path is the folder I want link into and the second path is the compiled source. Is this correct?To create a new symlink (will fail if symlink exists already):To create or update a symlink:Where the -s makes it symbolic.You can have a look at the man page here:http://linux.die.net/man/1/ln(Because an ascii picture is worth a thousand characters.) An arrow may be a helpful nmeumonic, especially since that\'s almost exactly how it looks in Emacs\' dired. And big picture so you don\'t get it confused with Windows\' versionLinux: Windows: You could also look at these as The from-here should not exist yet, it is to be created, while the to-here should already exist (IIRC). (I always get mixed up on whether various commands and arguments should involve a pre-existing location, or one to be made.) EDIT: It\'s still sinking in slowly for me; I have another way I\'ve written in my notes. http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?lnTo the original question:This will indeed create a symbolic link (-s) from the file/directory:to your new linkHere\'s a few ways to help you remember: First, there\'s the man page for ln. You can access this via searching "man ln" in google, or just open a terminal window and type man ln and you\'ll get the same information. The man page clearly states:ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME   (1st form)If having to search or read through a man page every time isn\'t for you, maybe you\'ll have an easier time remembering that all nix commands work the same way:cp copies a file that currently exists (the first argument) to a new file (the second argument).\nmv moves a file that currently exists (the first argument) to a new place (the second argument)\nLikewise ln links a file that currently exists (the first argument) to a new link (the second argument)*The final option I would like to suggest is you can create your own man pages that are easy to read and easy (for you) to find/remember. Just make a simple shell script that gives you the hint you need. For example\xe2\x99\xa6:In your .bash_aliases file you can place something like:Then when you need it, from the command line just type cmds and you\'ll get back the proper syntax in a way you can quickly read and understand it. You can make these functions as advanced as you\'d like to get what what information you need, it\'s up to you. You could even make them interactive so you just have to follow the prompts.. something like:* - well obviously they can all take different parameters and do different things and can work on files as well as directories... but the premise is the same\n\xe2\x99\xa6 - examples using the bash shell ln -s sourcepath linkpathname Note:-s makes symbolic links instead of hard linksIf you are in the directory where you want to create symlink, then ignore second path.It will create symlink of target inside myfolder. General syntaxI\'d like to present a plainer-English version of the descriptions already presented.The "ln" command creates a link-FILE, and the "-s" specifies that the type of link will be symbolic.  An example of a symbolic-link file can be found in a WINE installation (using "ls -la" to show one line of the directory contents):Standard file-info stuff is at left (although note the first character is an "l" for "link"); the file-name is "a:" and the "->" also indicates the file is a link.  It basically tells WINE how Windows "Drive A:" is to be associated with a floppy drive in Linux.  To actually create a symbolic link SIMILAR to that (in current directory, and to actually do this for WINE is more complicated; use the "winecfg" utility):Open Bash prompt and type the below mentioned command to make a symbolic link to your file:A) Goto the folder where you want to create a soft link and typeout the command as mentioned below:$ ln -s (path-to-file) (symbolic-link-to-file)$ ln -s /home/user/file new-fileB) Goto your new-file name path and type:$ ls -lrt (To see if the new-file is linked to the file or not)Example:ls -lrtlrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 24 Aug  6 23:40 new-file -> /home/user/fileNote: Where, A -> B Means, A is symbolically linked to BThere are two types of links: symbolic links: Refer to a symbolic path indicating the abstract location of another filehard links: Refer to the specific location of physical data.In your case symlinks:you can refer to http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/symlink.7.htmlyou can create too hard linksA hard link to a file is indistinguishable from the original directory entry; any changes to a file are effectively independent of the name used to reference the file. Hard links may not normally refer to directories and may not span file systems.for creating symbolic link /soft link  please use below methode.g. ln -s file1 link1How to create symlink in vagrant. \nSteps:
