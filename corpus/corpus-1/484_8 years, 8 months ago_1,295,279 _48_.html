Short and simple. I\'ve got a huge list of date-times like this as strings:I\'m going to be shoving these back into proper datetime fields in a database so I need to magic them into real datetime objects. Any help (even if it\'s just a kick in the right direction) would be appreciated.Edit: This is going through Django\'s ORM so I can\'t use SQL to do the conversion on insert.The resulting datetime object is timezone-naive.Links:Python documentation for strptime: Python 2, Python 3Python documentation for strftime format mask: Python 2, Python 3This is also a really nice reference for strftimeNotes:Use the third party dateutil library:It can handle most date formats, including the one you need to parse. It\'s more convenient than strptime as it can guess the correct format most of the time.It very useful for writing tests, where readability is more important than performance.You can install it with:Check out strptime in the time module.  It is the inverse of strftime.I have put together a project that can convert some really neat expressions. Check out timestring. Many timestamps have an implied timezone. To ensure that your code will work in every timezone, you should use UTC internally and attach a timezone each time a foreign object enters the system.Python 3.2+:Remember this and you didn\'t need to get confused in datetime conversion again.String to datetime object = strptimedatetime object to other formats = strftimeJun 1 2005  1:33PMis equals to%b %d %Y %I:%M%p%b    Month as locale\xe2\x80\x99s abbreviated name(Jun)%d    Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number(1)%Y    Year with century as a decimal number(2015)%I    Hour (12-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number(01)%M    Minute as a zero-padded decimal number(33)%p    Locale\xe2\x80\x99s equivalent of either AM or PM(PM)so you need strptime i-e converting string to OutputWhat if you have different format of dates you can use panda or dateutil.parseOutPutSomething that isn\'t mentioned here and is useful: adding a suffix to the day. I decoupled the suffix logic so you can use it for any number you like, not just dates.Here is a solution using Pandas to convert dates formatted as strings into datetime.date objects.And here is how to convert the OP\'s original date-time examples:There are many options for converting from the strings to Pandas Timestamps using to_datetime, so check the docs if you need anything special.Likewise, Timestamps have many properties and methods that can be accessed in addition to .dateDjango Timezone aware datetime object example.This conversion is very important for Django and Python when you have USE_TZ = True:Create a small utility function like:This is versatile enough:The datetime python module is good for get date time and convert date time formats.output :This question has been visited many times but arrow hasn\'t been mentioned, and it offers many useful functions for dates and times. This bit of code provides an answer to the question and shows that arrow is also capable of formatting dates easily and displaying information for other locales.See http://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for more.You can use easy_date to make it easy:
