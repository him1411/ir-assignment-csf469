How can you enumerate an enum in C#?E.g. the following code does not compile:And gives the following compile-time error:\'Suit\' is a \'type\' but is used like a \'variable\'It fails on the Suit keyword, the second one.It looks to me like you really want to print out the names of each enum, rather than the values. In which case Enum.GetNames() seems to be the right approach.By the way, incrementing the value is not a good way to enumerate the values of an enum. You should do this instead.I would use Enum.GetValues(typeof(Suit)) instead.I made some extensions for easy enum usage, maybe someone can use it...The enum itself must be decorated with the FlagsAttributeSome versions of the .NET framework do not support Enum.GetValues. Here\'s a good workaround from Ideas 2.0: Enum.GetValues in Compact Framework:As with any code that involves reflection, you should take steps to ensure it runs only once and results are cached.I think this is more efficient than other suggestions because GetValues() is not called each time you have a loop. It is also more concise. And you get a compile-time error not a runtime exception if Suit is not an enum.EnumLoop has this completely generic definition:Why is no one using Cast<T>?There you go IEnumerable<Suit>.You won\'t get Enum.GetValues() in Silverlight.Original Blog Post by Einar Ingebrigtsen:Just to add my solution, which works in compact framework (3.5) and supports type checking at compile time:- If anyone knows how to get rid of the T valueType = new T(), I\'d be happy to see a solution.A call would look like this:I think you can useI\'ve heard vague rumours that this is\n  terifically slow. Anyone know? \xe2\x80\x93 Orion\n  Edwards Oct 15 \'08 at 1:31 7   I think caching the array would speed it up considerably.  It looks like you\'re getting a new array (through reflection) every time.  Rather:That\'s at least a little faster, ja?What the hell I\'ll throw my two pence in, just by combining the top answers I through together a very simple extensionClean simple and by @Jeppe-Stig-Nielsen s comment fast.I use ToString() then split and parse the spit array in flags.Three ways:Not sure why was GetEnumValues introduced on type instance, it isn\'t very readable at all for me.Having a helper class like Enum<T> is what is most readable and memorable for me:Now you call:One can also use sort of caching if performance matters, but I don\'t expect this to be an issue at allThere are two ways to iterate an Enum:The first will give you values in form on a array of object, and the second will give you values in form of array of String.Use it in foreach loop as below:If enum values range strictly from 0 to n - 1, a generic alternative:If enum values are contiguous and you can provide the first and last element of the enum, then:but that\'s not strictly enumerating, just looping. The second method is much faster than any other approach though...If you need speed and type checking at build and run time, this helper method is better than using LINQ to cast each element:And you can use it like below:Of course you can return IEnumerable<T>, but that buys you nothing here.here is a working example of creating select options for a DDL(The current accepted answer has a cast that I don\'t think \nis needed (although I may be wrong).)This question appears in Chapter 10 of "C# Step by Step 2013"The author uses a double for-loop to iterate through a pair of Enumerators (to create a full deck of cards):In this case, Suit and Value are both enumerations:and PlayingCard is a card object with a defined Suit and Value:I know it is a bit messy but if you are fan of one-liners, here is one:A simple and generic way to convert an enum to something you can interact:And then:What if you know the type will be an enum, but you don\'t know what the exact type is at compile time?The method getListOfEnum uses reflection to take any enum type and returns an IEnumerable of all enum values.Usage:Also you can bind to the public static members of the enum directly by using reflection:Add method public static IEnumerable<T> GetValues<T>() to your class, likecall and pass your enum, now you can iterate through it using foreach
