Can I ignore files locally without polluting the global git config for everyone else? I have untracked files that are spam in my git status but I don\'t want to commit git config changes for every single little random untracked file I have in my local branches.From the relevant Git documentation:Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which do not need to be shared with other related repositories (e.g., auxiliary files that live inside the repository but are specific to one user\'s workflow) should go into the $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file.The .git/info/exclude file has the same format as any .gitignore file. Another option is to set core.excludesFile to the name of a file containing global patterns.Note, if you already have unstaged changes you must run the following after editing your ignore-patterns:Note on $GIT_DIR: This is a notation used all over the git manual simply to indicate the path to the git repository. If the environment variable is set, then it will override the location of whichever repo you\'re in, which probably isn\'t what you want.Update: Consider using git update-index --skip-worktree [<file>...] instead, thanks @danShumway! See Borealid\'s explanation on the difference of the two options.Old answer:If you need to ignore local changes to tracked files (we have that with local modifications to config files), use git update-index --assume-unchanged [<file>...].Add the following lines to the [alias] section of your .gitconfig fileNow you can use git ignore my_file to ignore changes to the local file, and git unignore my_file to stop ignoring the changes. git ignored lists the ignored files.This answer was gleaned from http://gitready.com/intermediate/2009/02/18/temporarily-ignoring-files.html.You have several options:Also, make sure you are using patterns and not explicitly enumerating files, when applicable.I think you are looking for:which ignore changes made localHere\'s http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/05/20/keep-local-modifications-in-git-tracked-files/ more explanation about these solution!You can simply add a .gitignore file to your home directory; i.e., $HOME/.gitignore or ~/.gitignore.This is a normal .gitignore file which git references when deciding what to ignore. Since it\'s in your home directory, it applies only to you and doesn\'t pollute any project .gitignore files.I\'ve been using this approach for years with great results.You can install some git aliases to make this process simpler. This edits the [alias] node of your .gitconfig file.The shortcuts this installs for you are as follows:I built these by referring to phatmann\'s answer \xe2\x80\x94 which presents an --assume-unchanged version of the same.The version I present uses --skip-worktree for ignoring local changes. See Borealid\'s answer for a full explanation of the difference, but essentially --skip-worktree\'s purpose is for developers to change files without the risk of committing their changes.The git ignored command presented here uses git ls-files -v, and filters the list to show just those entries beginning with the S tag. The S tag denotes a file whose status is "skip worktree". For a full list of the file statuses shown by git ls-files: see the documentation for the -t option on git ls-files.If your repo doesn\'t already have a .gitignore file, then a simple solution is to create a .gitignore file, and in it add .gitignore to the list of files to be ignored.
