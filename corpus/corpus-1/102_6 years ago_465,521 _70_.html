I recently forked a project and applied several fixes. I then created a pull request which was then accepted.A few days later another change was made by another contributor. So my fork doesn\'t contain that change... How can I get that change into my fork?Do I need to delete and re-create my fork when I have further changes to contribute? Or is there an update button?In your local clone of your forked repository, you can add the original GitHub repository as a "remote".  ("Remotes" are like nicknames for the URLs of repositories - origin is one, for example.)  Then you can fetch all the branches from that upstream repository, and rebase your work to continue working on the upstream version.  In terms of commands that might look like:If you don\'t want to rewrite the history of your master branch, (for example because other people may have cloned it) then you should replace the last command with git merge upstream/master.  However, for making further pull requests that are as clean as possible, it\'s probably better to rebase.If you\'ve rebased your branch onto upstream/master you may need to force the push in order to push it to your own forked repository on GitHub.  You\'d do that with:You only need to use the -f the first time after you\'ve rebased.Starting in May 2014, it is possible to update a fork directly from GitHub. This still works as of October 2016, BUT it will lead to a dirty commit history.Now you have three options, but each will lead to a less-than-clean commit history.So yes, you can keep your repo updated with its upstream using the GitHub web UI, but doing so will sully your commit history. Stick to the command line instead - it\'s easy.Here is GitHub\'s official document on Syncing a fork:Before you can sync, you need to add a remote that points to the upstream repository. You may have done this when you originally forked.Tip: Syncing your fork only updates your local copy of the repository; it does not update your repository on GitHub.There are two steps required to sync your repository with the upstream: first you must fetch from the remote, then you must merge the desired branch into your local branch.Fetching from the remote repository will bring in its branches and their respective commits. These are stored in your local repository under special branches.We now have the upstream\'s master branch stored in a local branch, upstream/masterNow that we have fetched the upstream repository, we want to merge its changes into our local branch. This will bring that branch into sync with the upstream, without losing our local changes.If your local branch didn\'t have any unique commits, git will instead perform a "fast-forward":Tip: If you want to update your repository on GitHub, follow the instructions hereA lot of answers end up moving your fork one commit ahead of the parent repository. This answer summarizes the steps found here which will move your fork to the same commit as the parent.Change directory to your local repository.Add the parent as a remote repository, git remote add upstream <repo-location>Issue git rebase upstream/masterIssue git push origin masterFor more information about these commands, refer to step 3.Since November 2013 there has been an unofficial feature request open with GitHub to ask them to add a very simple and intuitive method to keep a local fork in sync with upstream:https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/121Note: Since the feature request is unofficial it is also advisable to contact support@github.com to add your support for a feature like this to be implemented. The unofficial feature request above could be used as evidence of the amount of interest in this being implemented.Foreword: Your fork is the "origin" and the repository you forked from is the "upstream".Let\'s assume that you cloned already your fork to your computer with a command like this:If that is given then you need to continue in this order:Add the "upstream" to your cloned repository ("origin"):Fetch the commits (and branches) from the "upstream":Switch to the "master" branch of your fork ("origin"):Stash the changes of your "master" branch:Merge the changes from the "master" branch of the "upstream" into your the "master" branch of your "origin":Resolve merge conflicts if any and commit your mergePush the changes to your forkGet back your stashed changes (if any)You\'re done! Congratulations!GitHub also provides instructions for this topic: Syncing a forkAs of the date of this answer, GitHub has not (or shall I say no longer?) this feature in the web interface. You can, however, ask support@github.com to add your vote for that.In the meantime, GitHub user bardiharborow has created a tool to do just this:\nhttps://upriver.github.io/Source is here: https://github.com/upriver/upriver.github.ioIf, like me, you never commit anything directly to master, which you should really, you can do the following.From the local clone of your fork create your upstream remote, you only need to do that once:Then whenever you want to catch up with the upstream repository master branch you need to:Assuming you never committed anything on master yourself you should be done already. Now you can push your local master to your origin remote GitHub fork. You could also rebase your development branch on your now up-to-date local master.So past the initial upstream setup and master checkout, all you need to do is run the following command to sync your master with upstream: git pull upstream master.If you are using GitHub for Windows then now they have one click feature to update forks:Follow the below steps. I tried them and it helped me.Checkout to your branchSyntax: git branch yourDevelopmentBranch\n  Example: git checkout masterPull source repository branch for getting the latest codeSyntax: git pull https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas master\n  Example: git pull https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPO.git BRANCH_NAMEActually, it is possible to create branch in your fork from any commit of the upstream in browser:You can then fetch that branch to your local clone, and you won\'t have to push all that data back top github when you push edits on top of that commit. Or use web interface to change something in that branch.How it works (it is a guess, I don\'t know how exactly github does it): forks share object storage and use namespaces to separate users\' references. So you can access all commits through your fork, even if they did not exist by the time of forking.As a complement to this answer, I was looking for a way to update all remote tracking branches of my cloned repo from upstream in one go. This is how I did it.This assumes you have already configured an upstream remote pointing at the source repository and have synced it with git fetch upstream.Run:The first part of this command will list all heads in the remote repo upstream and remove the SHA-1 and /refs/heads/ prefix.Then for each of these branches, it will push the local copy of the remote branch (refs/remotes/upstream/<branch>) directly to the remote branch on origin (refs/heads/<branch>).Any of these branch sync commands may fail for one of two reasons: either the upstream branch have been rewritten or you have pushed commits on that branch to your fork. In the first case where you haven\'t committed anything to the branch on your fork it is safe to push forcefully (git push -f). In the other case this is normal as your fork branch have diverged and you can\'t expect the sync command to work until your commits have been merged back into upstream.I update my forked repos with this one line:Use this if you dont want to add another remote endpoint to your project, as other solutions posted here. That depends on the size of your repository and how you forked it.If it\'s quite a big repository you may have wanted to manage it in a special way (e.g. drop history). Basically you can get differences between current and upstream versions, commit them and then cherry pick back to master.Try reading this one. It describes how to handle big Git repositories and how to upstream them with latest changes.
