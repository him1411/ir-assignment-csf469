How can I loop through all members in a JavaScript object including values that are objects.For example, how could I loop through this (accessing the "your_name" and "your_message" for each)?Under ECMAScript 5, you can combine Object.keys() and Array.prototype.forEach():The problem with thisis that you\xe2\x80\x99ll also loop through the primitive object\'s prototype.With this one you will avoid it:Using Underscore.js\xe2\x80\x99s _.each:In ES6 you can loop through an object like this: (using arrow function)jsbinIn ES7 you can use Object.entries instead of Object.keys and loop through an object like this:The above would also work as a one-liner:jsbinIn case you want to loop through nested objects as well, you can use a recursive function (ES6):jsbinSame as function above, but with ES7 Object.entries instead of Object.keys:If you are into functional programming you can use Object.keys/Object.entries to enumerate the object, then process the values and then use reduce() to convert back to a new object.If you use recursion you can return object properties of any depth-I know it\'s waaay late, but it did take me 2 minutes to write this optimized and improved version of AgileJon\'s answer:In ES7 you can do:Here comes the improved and recursive version of AgileJon\'s solution (demo):This solution works for all kinds of different depths.Another option:I think it\'s worth pointing out that jQuery sorts this out nicely with $.each().See: https://api.jquery.com/each/For example:$(this) being the single item inside the object. Swap $(\'.foo\') to a variable if you don\'t want to use jQuery\'s selector engine.I couldn\'t get the above posts to do quite what I was after.After playing around with the other replies here, I made this. It\'s hacky, but it works!For this object:... this code:... produces this in the console:ECMAScript-2017, just finalized a month ago, introduces Object.values(). So now you can do this:In my case (on the basis of the preceding) is possible any number of levels.result:
