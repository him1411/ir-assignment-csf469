How can I recursively find all files in current and subfolders based on wildcard matching?Use find for that:find needs a starting point, and the . (dot) points to the current directory.Piping find into grep is often more convenient; it gives you the full power of regular expressions for arbitrary wildcard matching.For example, to find all files with case insensitive string "foo" in the filename:find will find all files that match a pattern:However, if you want a picture:Hope this helps!If you shell supports extended globbing (enable it by: shopt -s globstar), you can use:to find any files or folders recursively. This is supported by Bash, zsh and similar shells.In a few cases, I have needed the -L parameter to handle symbolic directory links.  By default symbolic links are ignored.  In those cases it was quite confusing as I would change directory to a sub-directory and see the file matching the pattern but find would not return the filename.  Using -L solves that issue.  The symbolic link options for find are -P -L -HIn the wildcard-match you can provide the string you wish to match e.g. *.c (for all c files) for file search\nfind / -xdev -name settings.xml   --> whole computer\nfind ./ -xdev -name settings.xml  --> current directory & its sub directory\nfor files with extension typeDefault way to search for recursive file, and available in most cases isIt starts recursive traversing for filename  or pattern from within current directory where you are positioned. With find command, you can use wildcards, and various switches, to see full list of options, typeor if man pages aren\'t available at your systemHowever, there are more modern and faster tools then find, which are traversing your whole filesystem and indexing your files, one such common tool is locate or slocate/mlocate, you should check manual of your OS on how to install it, and once it\'s installed it needs to initiate database, if install script don\'t do it for you, it can be done manually by typingAnd, to use it to look for some particular file typeOr, to look for filename or patter from within current directory, you can type:It will look through its database of files and quickly print out path names that match pattern that you have typed.\nTo see full list of locate\'s options, type:\nlocate --help or man locateAdditionally you can configure locate to update it\'s database on scheduled times via cron job, so sample cron which updates db at 1AM would look like:These cron jobs need to be configured by root, since updatedb needs root privilege to traverse whole filesystem.
