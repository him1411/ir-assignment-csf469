I like the Python list comprehension syntax.Can it be used to create dictionaries too? For example, by iterating over pairs of keys and values:In Python 2.6 and earlier, the dict constructor can receive an iterable of key/value pairs:From Python 2.7 and 3 onwards, you can just use the dict comprehension syntax directly:Of course, you can use the iterable in any way you want (tuples and lists literals, generator comprehensions, list comprehensions, generator functions, functional composition... feel creative) as long as each element is an iterable itself of two elements:In Python 3 / Python 2.7+ dict comprehensions works like this:For Python 2.6 and earlier, see fortran\'s answer.In fact, you don\'t even need to iterate over the iterable if it already comprehends some kind of mapping, the dict constructor doing it graciously for you:In Python 2.7, it goes like:Zip them!Use Python dict comprehensions. Here\'s the page to know more about it: Dict Comprehensions.To add onto @fortran\'s answer, if you want to iterate over a list of keys key_list as well as a list of values value_list:orSimple for older version < 2.7for version >= 2.7I like the Python list comprehension syntax.Can it be used to create dictionaries too? For example, by iterating\n  over pairs of keys and values:Assuming blah blah blah is an iterable of two-tuples - you\'re so close. Let\'s create some "blahs" like that:Now the syntax here is the mapping part. What makes this a dict comprehension instead of a set comprehension (which is what your pseudocode approximates) is the colon, :And now:Just like list comprehensions, you can add a filter part to the end:Here we test for if the last character is divisible by 2.Try this,Assume we have two lists country and capitalThen create dictionary from the two lists:The output is like this,
