Did you set the execution policy in both hosts?Running as administrator, you can set the execution policy by typing this into your PowerShell window:For more information, see Using the Set-ExecutionPolicy Cmdlet.You can bypass this policy by adding -ExecutionPolicy ByPass when running PowerShellI had a similar issue and noted that the default cmd on Windows Server 2012, was running the x64 one.For Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2012, run the following commands as Administrator:x86 (32 bit)\nOpen C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\cmd.exe\nRun the command powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSignedx64 (64 bit)\nOpen C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\nRun the command powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSignedYou can check mode using References:\nMSDN - Windows PowerShell execution policies\nWindows - 32bit vs 64bit directory explanationMost of the existing answers explain the How, but very few explain the Why. And before you go around executing code from strangers on the Internet, especially code that disables security measures, you should understand exactly what you\'re doing. So here\'s a little more detail on this problem.From the TechNet About Execution Policies Page:Windows PowerShell execution policies let you determine the conditions under which Windows PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts.The benefits of which, as enumerated by PowerShell Basics - Execution Policy and Code Signing, are:To check your current execution policy, you can run Get-ExecutionPolicy. But you\'re probably here because you want to change it.To do so you\'ll run the Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet.You\'ll have two major decisions to make when updating the execution policy.\xe2\x80\xa0 = DefaultFor example: if you wanted to change the policy to RemoteSigned for just the CurrentUser, you\'d run the following command:Note: In order to change the Execution policy, you must be running PowerShell As Adminstrator.\nIf you are in regular mode and try to change the execution policy, you\'ll get the following error:Access to the registry key \'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\\Microsoft.PowerShell\' is denied. To change the execution policy for the default (LocalMachine) scope, start Windows PowerShell with the "Run as administrator" option.If you want to tighten up the internal restrictions on your own scripts that have not been downloaded from the Internet (or at least don\'t contain the UNC metadata), you can force the policy to only run signed sripts.  To sign your own scripts, you can follow the instructions on Scott Hanselman\'s article on Signing PowerShell Scripts.Note: Most people are likely to get this error whenever they open Powershell because the first thing PS tries to do when it launches is execute your user profile script that sets up your environment however you like it.  The file is typically located in:You can find the exact location by running the powershell variableIf there\'s nothing that you care about in the profile, and don\'t want to fuss with your security settings, you can just delete it and powershell won\'t find anything that it cannot execute.Also running this command before the script also solves the issue:In Windows 7:Go to Start Menu and search for "Windows PowerShell ISE".Right click the x86 version and choose "Run as administrator".In the top part, paste Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned; run the script. Choose "Yes".Repeat these steps for the 64-bit version of Powershell ISE too (the non x86 version).I\'m just clarifying the steps that @Chad Miller hinted at.  Thanks Chad!If you are in an environment where you are not an administrator, you can set the Execution Policy just for you, and it will not require administrator.orYou can read all about it in the help entry.RemoteSigned: all scripts you created yourself will be run, and all scripts downloaded from the Internet will need to be signed by a trusted publisher.OK, change the policy by simply typing:I\'m using Windows 10 and was unable to run any command. The only command that gave me some clues was this: [x64]But this didn\'t work. It was limited. Probably new security policies for Windows10. I had this error: Set-ExecutionPolicy: Windows PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully, but the setting is overridden by a policy defined at a more specific scope. Due to the override, your shell will retain its current effective execution policy of...So I found another way (solution):Now open PowerShell and enjoy ;)Setting the execution policy is environment-specific. If you are trying to execute a script from the running x86 ISE you have to use the x86 PowerShell to set the execution policy. Likewise, if you are running the 64-bit ISE you have to set the policy with the 64-bit PowerShell.We can get the status of current ExecutionPolicy by the command below:By default it is Restricted. To allow the execution of PowerShell Scripts we need to set this ExecutionPolicy either as Bypass or Unrestricted.We can set the policy for Current User as Bypass or Unrestricted by using any of the below PowerShell command:Unrestricted policy loads all configuration files and runs all scripts. If you run an unsigned script that was downloaded from the Internet, you are prompted for permission before it runs.Whereas in Bypass policy, nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts during script execution. Bypass ExecutionPolicy is more relaxed than Unrestricted.You can also bypass this by using the following command:You can also read this article by Scott Sutherland that explains 15 different ways to bypass the Powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy if you don\'t have admin privileges.https://blog.netspi.com/15-ways-to-bypass-the-powershell-execution-policy/In the PowerShell ISE editor I found running the following line first allowed scripts.go to the registry path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\\Microsoft.PowerShelland set ExecutionPolicy : RemoteSignedIf you\'re here because of running it with Ruby or Chef and using `` system execution, execute as follows:That command is for getting "MyDocuments" Folder.-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted does the trick.I hope it\'s helpful for someone else.Several answers point to execution policy.  However some things require "runas administrator" also.  This is safest in that there is no permanent change to execution policy, and can get past administrator restriction. Use with schedtask to start a batch with:  from both Jack Edmonds above, and Peter Mortensen / Dhana of post How to run an application as "run as administrator" from the command prompt?I found this line worked best for one of my Windows Server 2008 R2 servers. A couple of others had no issues without this line in my PowerShell scripts:In PowerShell 2.0, the execution policy was set to disabled by default.From then on, the PowerShell team has made a lot of improvements, and they are confident that users will not break things much while running scripts. So from PowerShell 4.0 onward, it is enabled by default.In your case, type Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned from the PowerShell console and say yes.Open the Powershell as an Administrator. It will works
