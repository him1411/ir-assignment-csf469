Is there a JavaScript equivalent of Java\'s class.getName()?Is there a JavaScript equivalent of Java\'s class.getName()?No.But here are various hacks that all fall down in one way or another:Here is a hack that will do what you need - be aware that it modifies the Object\'s prototype, something people frown upon (usually for good reason)Now, all of your objects will have the function, getName(), that will return the name of the constructor as a string. I have tested this in FF3 and IE7, I can\'t speak for other implementations.If you don\'t want to do that, here is a discussion on the various ways of determining types in JavaScript...I recently updated this to be a bit more exhaustive, though it is hardly that. Corrections welcome...Every object has a value for its constructor property, but depending on how that object was constructed as well as what you want to do with that value, it may or may not be useful. Generally speaking, you can use the constructor property to test the type of the object like so:So, that works well enough for most needs. That said...Will not work AT ALL in many casesThis pattern, though broken, is quite common:Objects constructed via new Thingy will have a constructor property that points to Object, not Thingy. So we fall right at the outset; you simply cannot trust constructor in a codebase that you don\'t control.Multiple InheritanceAn example where it isn\'t as obvious is using multiple inheritance:Things now don\'t work as you might expect them to:So, you might get unexpected results if the object your testing has a different object set as its prototype. There are ways around this outside the scope of this discussion.There are other uses for the constructor property, some of them interesting, others not so much; for now we will not delve into those uses since it isn\'t relevant to this discussion.Will not work cross-frame and cross-windowUsing .constructor for type checking will break when you want to check the type of objects coming from different window objects, say that of an iframe or a popup window. This is because there\'s a different version of each core type constructor in each `window\', i.e.The instanceof operator is a clean way of testing object type as well, but has its own potential issues, just like the constructor property.But instanceof fails to work for literal values (because literals are not Objects)The literals need to be wrapped in an Object in order for instanceof to work, for exampleThe .constructor check works fine for literals because the . method invocation implicitly wraps the literals in their respective object typeWhy two dots for the 3? Because Javascript interprets the first dot as a decimal point ;)instanceof also will not work across different windows, for the same reason as the constructor property check.Again, see above; it\'s quite common for constructor to be utterly and completely wrong and useless.Using myObjectInstance.constructor.name will give you a string containing the name of the constructor function used, but is subject to the caveats about the constructor property that were mentioned earlier.For IE9 and above, you can monkey-patch in support:Updated version from the article in question. This was added 3 months after the article was published, this is the recommended version to use by the article\'s author Matthew Scharley. This change was inspired by comments pointing out potential pitfalls in the previous code.It turns out, as this post details, you can use Object.prototype.toString - the low level and generic implementation of toString - to get the type for all built-in typesOne could write a short helper function such asto remove the cruft and get at just the type nameHowever, it will return Object for all user-defined types.All of these are subject to one potential problem, and that is the question of how the object in question was constructed. Here are various ways of building objects and the values that the different methods of type checking will return:While not all permutations are present in this set of examples, hopefully there are enough to provide you with an idea about how messy things might get depending on your needs. Don\'t assume anything, if you don\'t understand exactly what you are after, you may end up with code breaking where you don\'t expect it to because of a lack of grokking the subtleties.Discussion of the typeof operator may appear to be a glaring omission, but it really isn\'t useful in helping to identify whether an object is a given type, since it is very simplistic. Understanding where typeof is useful is important, but I don\'t currently feel that it is terribly relevant to this discussion. My mind is open to change though. :)Jason Bunting\'s answer gave me enough of a clue to find what I needed:So, for example, in the following piece of code:myInstance.constructor.name would return "MyObject".A little trick I use:To be precise, I think OP asked for a function that retrieves the constructor name for a particular object. In terms of Javascript, object does not have a type but is a type of and in itself. However, different objects can have different constructors.Â Note: the below example is deprecated.A blog post linked by Christian Sciberras contains a good example on how to do it. Namely, by extending the Object prototype:Here is a solution that I have come up with that solves the shortcomings of instanceof. It can check an object\'s types from cross-windows and cross-frames and doesn\'t have problems with primitive types.isInstance requires two parameters: an object and a type. The real trick to how it works is that it checks if the object is from the same window and if not gets the object\'s window.Examples:The type argument can also be a callback function which returns a constructor. The callback function will receive one parameter which is the window of the provided object.Examples:One thing to keep in mind is that IE < 9 does not provide the constructor on all objects so the above test for NodeList would return false and also a isInstance(alert, "Function") would return false.You can use the instanceof operator to see if an object is an instance of another, but since there are no classes, you can\'t get a class name.Use constructor.name when you can, and regex function when I can\'t.The kind() function from Agave.JS will return:It works on all JS objects and primitives, regardless of how they were created, and doesn\'t have any surprises. Examples:Using Object.prototype.toStringIt turns out, as this post details, you can use Object.prototype.toString - the low level and generic implementation of toString - to get the type for all built-in typesOne could write a short helper function such asYou can use the "instanceof" operator to determine if an object is an instance of a certain class or not. If you do not know the name of an object\'s type, you can use its constructor property. The constructor property of objects, is a reference to the function that is used to initialize them. Example:Now c1.constructor is a reference to the Circle() function.\nYou can alsow use the typeof operator, but the typeof operator shows limited information. One solution is to use the toString() method of the Object global object. For example if you have an object, say myObject, you can use the toString() method of the global Object to determine the type of the class of myObject. Use this:I was actually looking for a similar thing and came across this question. Here is how I get types: jsfiddleThe closest you can get is typeof, but it only returns "object" for any sort of custom type. For those, see Jason Bunting.Edit, Jason\'s deleted his post for some reason, so just use Object\'s constructor property.Here is an implementation based on the accepted answer:We only use the constructor property when we have no other choice.If anyone was looking for a solution which is working with jQuery, here is the adjusted wiki code (the original breaks jQuery).Lodash has many isMethods so if you\'re using Lodash maybe a mixin like this can be useful:It adds a method to lodash called "identify" which works as follow:Plunker:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/Zdr0KDtQt76Ul3KTEDSNOk, folks I\'ve been slowly building a catch all method for this over some years lol!  The trick is to:For an example (or to see how I dealt with the problem) look at the following code on github: https://github.com/elycruz/sjljs/blob/master/src/sjl/sjl.js and search for:classOf =, \nclassOfIs =, and or\ndefineSubClass = (without the backticks (`)).  As you can see I have some mechanisms in place to force classOf to always give me the classes/constructors type name regardless of whether it is a primitive, a user defined class, a value created using a native constructor, Null, NaN, etc..  For every single javascript value I will get it\'s unique type name from the classOf function.  In addition I can pass in actual constructors into sjl.classOfIs to check a value\'s type in addition to being able to pass in it\'s type name as well!  So for example:```\n    // Please forgive long namespaces!  I had no idea on the impact until after using them for a while (they suck haha)```If you are interested in reading more on how I use the setup mentioned above take a look at the repo: https://github.com/elycruz/sjljs Also books with content on the subject:\n- "JavaScript Patterns" by Stoyan Stefanov.\n- "Javascript - The Definitive Guide." by David Flanagan.\n- and many others..
