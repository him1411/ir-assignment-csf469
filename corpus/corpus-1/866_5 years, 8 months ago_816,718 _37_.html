How can I reset the auto-increment of a field? I want it to start counting from 1 again.You can reset the counter with:For InnoDB you cannot set the auto_increment value lower or equal to the highest current index. (quote from ViralPatel):Note that you cannot reset the counter to a value less than or equal\n  to any that have already been used. For MyISAM, if the value is less\n  than or equal to the maximum value currently in the AUTO_INCREMENT\n  column, the value is reset to the current maximum plus one. For\n  InnoDB, if the value is less than the current maximum value in the\n  column, no error occurs and the current sequence value is not changed.See How to Reset an MySQL AutoIncrement using a MAX value from another table? on how to dynamically get an acceptable value.Simply like this:reference: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/alter-table.htmlThere is a very easy way with phpmyadmin under the "operations" tab, you can set, in the table options, autoincrement to the number you want.I think this will do itThe best solution that worked for me:Its fast, works with innoDB, and I don\'t need to know the current maximum value!\nThis way the auto increment counter will reset and it will start automatically from the maximum value exists.There are good options given in How To Reset MySQL Autoincrement ColumnNote that ALTER TABLE tablename AUTO_INCREMENT = value; does not work for InnoDBThe highest rated answers to this question all recommend "ALTER yourtable AUTO_INCREMENT= value".

According to the MySQL documentation:  You cannot reset the counter to a value less than or equal to any that\n  have already been used. For MyISAM, if the value is less than or equal\n  to the maximum value currently in the AUTO_INCREMENT column, the value\n  is reset to the current maximum plus one. For InnoDB, you can use\n  ALTER TABLE ... AUTO_INCREMENT = value as of MySQL 5.0.3, but if the\n  value is less than the current maximum value in the column, no error\n  occurs and the current sequence value is not changed.In essence, you can only alter AUTO_INCREMENT to increase the value of the autoincrement column, not reset it to 1, as the OP asks in the second part of the question.
