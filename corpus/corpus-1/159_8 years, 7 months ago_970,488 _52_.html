How do I access the index itself for a list like the following?When I loop through it using a for loop, how do I access the loop index, from 1 to 5 in this case?Using an additional state variable, such as an index variable (which you would normally use in languages such as C or PHP), is considered non-pythonic.The better option is to use the built-in function enumerate(), available in both Python 2 and 3:Check out PEP 279 for more.Use enumerate:And note that indexes start at zero, so you would get 0 to 4 with this. If you want the count, I explain that below.What you are asking for is the Pythonic equivalent of the following, which is the algorithm most programmers of lower-level languages would use:Or in languages that do not have a for-each loop:or sometimes more commonly (but unidiomatically) found in Python:Python\'s enumerate function reduces the visual clutter by hiding the accounting for the indexes, and encapsulating the iterable into another iterable (an enumerate object) that yields a two-item tuple of the index and the item that the original iterable would provide. That looks like this:This code sample is fairly well the canonical example of the difference between code that is idiomatic of Python and code that is not. Idiomatic code is sophisticated (but not complicated) Python, written in the way that it was intended to be used. Idiomatic code is expected by the designers of the language, which means that usually this code is not just more readable, but also more efficient.Even if you don\'t need indexes as you go, but you need a count of the iterations (sometimes desirable) you can start with 1 and the final number will be your count.The count seems to be more what you intend to ask for (as opposed to index) when you said you wanted from 1 to 5.To break these examples down, say we have a list of items that we want to iterate over with an index:Now we pass this iterable to enumerate, creating an enumerate object:We can pull the first item out of this iterable that we would get in a loop with the next function:And we see we get a tuple of 0, the first index, and \'a\', the first item:we can use what is referred to as "sequence unpacking" to extract the elements from this two-tuple:and when we inspect index, we find it refers to the first index, 0, and item refers to the first item, \'a\'.So do this:It\'s pretty simple to start it from 1 other than 0:Important hint, though a little misleading, since index will be a tuple (idx, item) here.\nGood to go.Old fashioned way:List comprehension:I don\'t know if the following is pythonic or not, but it uses the Python function enumerate and prints the enumerator and the value.First of all, the indexes will be from 0 to 4. Programming languages start counting from 0; don\'t forget that or you will come across an index out of bounds exception. All you need in the for loop is a variable counting from 0 to 4 like so:Keep in mind that I wrote 0 to 5 because the loop stops one number before the max. :)To get the value of an index useThis way you can extend a list. Extend means you can add multiple values at a time.To append this list you have to write the code given below:This way you can add a single value at a time. If you write ints.append([1]) so this will create a sub list for this element.According to this discussion: http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/464012-objects-list-indexLoop counter iterationThe current idiom for looping over the indices makes use of the built-in \'range\' function:Looping over both elements and indices can be achieved either by the old idiom or by using the new \'zip\' built-in function[2]:orvia http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0212/The fastest way to access indexes of list within loop in Python 2.7 is to use the range method for small lists and enumerate method for medium and huge size lists.Please see different approaches which can be used to iterate over list and access index value and their performance metrics (which I suppose would be useful for you) in code samples below:See performance metrics for each method below:As the result, using range method is the fastest one up to list with 1000 items. For list with size > 10 000 items enumerate is the winner.Adding some useful links below:What is the difference between range and xrange functions in Python 2.X?What is faster for loop using enumerate or for loop using xrange in Python?range(len(list)) or enumerate(list)?As is the norm in Python there are several ways to do this. In all examples assume: lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]This is also the safest option in my opinion because the chance of going into infinite recursion has been eliminated. Both the item and its index are held in variables and there is no need to write any further code\nto access the item.As explained before, there are other ways to do this that have not been explained here and they may even apply more in other situations. e.g using itertools.chain with for. It handles nested loops better than the other examples.You can do it with this code:Use this code if you need to reset the index value at the end of the loop:Best solution for this problem is use enumerate in-build python function. \nenumerate return tuple \nfirst value is index \nsecond value is element of array at that index
