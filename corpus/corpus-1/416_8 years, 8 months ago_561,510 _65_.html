I "accidentally" pushed a commit to GitHub.Is it possible to remove this commit?I want to revert my GitHub repository as it was before this commit.Note: please see alternative to git rebase -i in the comments below\xe2\x80\x94git reset --soft HEAD^First, remove the commit on your local repository. You can do this using git rebase -i. For example, if it\'s your last commit, you can do git rebase -i HEAD~2 and delete the second line within the editor window that pops up. Then, force push to GitHub by using git push origin +branchNameSee Git Magic Chapter 5: Lessons of History - And Then Some for more information (i.e. if you want to remove older commits).Oh, and if your working tree is dirty, you have to do a git stash first, and then a git stash apply after.That should "undo" the push.For an easy revert if it\'s just a mistake (perhaps you forked a repo, then ended up pushing to the original instead of to a new one) here\'s another possibility:Obviously swap in that number for the number of the commit you want to return to. Everything since then will be deleted once you push again. To do that, the next step would be:git log\nto find out the commit you want to revertgit push origin +7f6d03:master\nwhile 7f6d03 is the commit before the wrongly pushed commit.\n+ was for force pushAnd that\'s it.Here is a very good guide that solves your problem, easy and simple!You\'ll need to clear out your cache to have it completely wiped.\nthis help page from git will help you out. (it helped me)\nhttp://help.github.com/remove-sensitive-data/Use git revert for reverting your push.git-revert - Revert some existing commitsRevert the changes that the related patches introduce, and record some new commits that record them. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).This work for me.To delete the commit from the remote repository:In order delete the commit from your local repository:linkFind the ref spec of the commit you want to be the head of your branch on Github and use the following command:git push origin +[ref]:[branchName]In your case, if you just want to go back one commit, find the beginning of the ref for that commit, say for example it is 7f6d03, and the name of the branch you want to change, say for example it is master, and do the following:git push origin +7f6d03:masterThe plus character is interpreted as --force, which will be necessary since you are rewriting history.Note that any time you --force a commit you could potentially rewrite other peoples\' history who merge your branch. However, if you catch the problem quickly (before anyone else merges your branch), you won\'t have any issues.You need to know your commit hash from the commit you want to revert to. You can get it from a GitHub URL like: https://github.com/your-organization/your-project/commits/masterLet\'s say the hash from the commit (where you want to go back to) is "99fb454" (long version "99fb45413eb9ca4b3063e07b40402b136a8cf264"), then all you have to do is:1 - Copy the commit reference  you like to go back to from the log:2 - Reset git to the commit reference:3 - Stash/store the local changes from the wrong commit to use later after pushing to remote:4 - Push the changes to remote repository, (-f or --force):5 - Get back the stored changes to local repository:7 - In case you have untracked/new files in the changes, you need to add them to git before committing:6 - Add whatever extra changes you need, then commit the needed files, (or use a dot \'.\' instead of stating each file name, to commit all files in the local repository:or If you are doing this because you have sensitive data in a commit, using the other answers here is not safe (excepting subutux\'s, which I\'ll expand on).The github guide on this recommends using a external tool, but I prefer using the built-in one.Firstly, make a backup of your repository. Then:After this, make sure the repository is in the state you want. You might want to diff against the backup.If you\'re sure it\'s correct, then:You might want to keep the local backup for a while, just in case.To preserve the branching and merging structure is important to use the --preserve-merges option when doing the rebase:Save your local changes first somewhere on the side ( backup )You can browse your recent commits, then select a commit hash by clicking on\n"Copy the full SHA" button to send it to the clipboard.If your last commit hash is, let\'s say g0834hg304gh3084gh ( for example )You have to run:git push origin +g0834hg304gh3084gh:masterUsing the hash that you\'ve copied earlier to make it the "HEAD" revision.Add your desired local changes. Done ;)Run this command on your terminal.You can remove the last n commits from local repo e.g. HEAD~2.\nProceed with force git push on your repository.Hope this helps!For GitHub - Reset your commits (HARD) in your local repo and create a new branch. Push new . Delete OLD branch. (Make new one as the default branch if you are deleting the master branch)Add/remove files to get things the way you want:Then amend the commit:The previous, erroneous commit will be edited to reflect the new index state - in other words, it\'ll be like you never made the mistake in the first placeNote that you should only do this if you haven\'t pushed yet. If you have pushed, then you\'ll just have to commit a fix normally.It is not very good to re-write the history.  If we use git revert <commit_id>, it creates a clean reverse-commit of the said commit id.This way, the history is not re-written, instead, everyone knows that there has been a revert.
