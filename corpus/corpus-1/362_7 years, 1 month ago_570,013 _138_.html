I am trying to make a <ul> slide down using CSS transitions.The <ul> starts off at height: 0;. On hover, the height is set to height:auto;. However, this is causing it to simply appear, not transition,If I do it from height: 40px; to height: auto;, then it will slide up to height: 0;, and then suddenly jump to the correct height.How else could I do this without using JavaScript?Use max-height in the transformation and not height. And set a value on max-height to something bigger than your box will ever get.See JSFiddle demo provided by Chris Jordan in another answer here.You should use scaleY instead.HTML:CSS:I\'ve made a vendor prefixed version of the above code on jsfiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/dotnetCarpenter/PhyQc/9/ and changed your jsfiddle to use scaleY instead of height, http://jsfiddle.net/dotnetCarpenter/7cnfc/206/.You can\'t currently animate on height when one of the heights involved is auto, you have to set two explicit heights.You can, with a little bit of non-semantic jiggery-pokery. My usual approach is to animate the height of an outer DIV which has a single child which is a style-less DIV used only for measuring the content height.CSS:JS:HTML:One would like to just be able to dispense with the measuringWrapper and just set the DIV\'s height to auto and have that animate, but that doesn\'t seem to work (the height gets set, but no animation occurs).CSS:JS:HTML:My interpretation is that an explicit height is needed for the animation to run. You can\'t get an animation on height when either height (the start or end height) is auto.The solution that I\'ve always used was to first fade out, then shrink the font-size, padding and margin values. It doesn\'t look the same as a wipe, but it works without a static height or max-height.Working example: https://jsfiddle.net/vk4dvjuj/My workaround is to transition max-height to the exact content height for a nice smooth animation, then use a transitionEnd callback to set max-height to 9999px so the content can resize freely.A visual workaround to animating height using CSS3 transitions is to animate the padding instead. You don\'t quite get the full wipe effect, but playing around with the transition-duration and padding values should get you close enough. If you don\'t want to explicitly set height/max-height, this should be what you\'re looking for.http://jsfiddle.net/catharsis/n5XfG/17/ (riffed off stephband\'s above jsFiddle)The accepted answer works for most cases, but it doesn\'t work well when your div can vary greatly in height \xe2\x80\x94 the animation speed is not dependent on the actual height of the content, and it can look choppy.You can still perform the actual animation with CSS, but you need to use JavaScript to compute the height of the items, instead of trying to use auto. No jQuery is required, although you may have to modify this a bit if you want compatibility (works in the latest version of Chrome :)).I know this is the thirty-somethingth answer to this question, but I think it\'s worth it, so here goes. This is a CSS-only solution with the following properties:Here\'s a demo with three collapsible elements, all of different heights, that all use the same CSS. You might want to click "full page" after clicking "run snippet". Note that the JavaScript only toggles the collapsed CSS class, there\'s no measuring involved. (You could do this exact demo without any JavaScript at all by using a checkbox or :target). Also note that the part of the CSS that\'s responsible for the transition is pretty short, and the HTML only requires a single additional wrapper element.There are in fact two transitions involved in making this happen. One of them transitions the margin-bottom from 0px (in the expanded state) to -2000px in the collapsed state (similar to this answer). The 2000 here is the first magic number, it\'s based on the assumption that your box won\'t be higher than this (2000 pixels seems like a reasonable choice).Using the margin-bottom transition alone by itself has two issues:Fixing this second issue is where the second transition comes in, and this transition conceptually targets the wrapper\'s minimum height ("conceptually" because we\'re not actually using the min-height property for this; more on that later).Here\'s an animation that shows how combining the bottom margin transition with the minimum height transition, both of equal duration, gives us a combined transition from full height to zero height that has the same duration.The left bar shows how the negative bottom margin pushes the bottom upwards, reducing the visible height. The middle bar shows how the minimum height ensures that in the collapsing case, the transition doesn\'t end early, and in the expanding case, the transition doesn\'t start late. The right bar shows how the combination of the two causes the box to transition from full height to zero height in the correct amount of time.For my demo I\'ve settled on 50px as the upper minimum height value. This is the second magic number, and it should be lower than the box\' height would ever be. 50px seems reasonable as well; it seems unlikely that you\'d very often want to make an element collapsible that isn\'t even 50 pixels high in the first place.As you can see in the animation, the resulting transition is continuous, but it is not differentiable -- at the moment when the minimum height is equal to the full height adjusted by the bottom margin, there is a sudden change in speed. This is very noticeable in the animation because it uses a linear timing function for both transitions, and because the whole transition is very slow. In the actual case (my demo at the top), the transition only takes 300ms, and the bottom margin transition is not linear. I\'ve played around with a lot of different timing functions for both transitions, and the ones I ended up with felt like they worked best for the widest variety of cases.Two problems remain to fix:We solve the first problem by giving the container element a max-height: 0 in the collapsed case, with a 0s 0.3s transition. This means that it\'s not really a transition, but the max-height is applied with a delay; it only applies once the transition is over. For this to work correctly, we also need to pick a numerical max-height for the opposite, non-collapsed, state. But unlike in the 2000px case, where picking too large of a number affects the quality of the transition, in this case, it really doesn\'t matter. So we can just pick a number that is so high that we know that no height will ever come close to this. I picked a million pixels. If you feel you may need to support content of a height of more than a million pixels, then 1) I\'m sorry, and 2) just add a couple of zeros.The second problem is the reason why we\'re not actually using min-height for the minimum height transition. Instead, there is an ::after pseudo-element in the container with a height that transitions from 50px to zero. This has the same effect as a min-height: It won\'t let the container shrink below whatever height the pseudo-element currently has. But because we\'re using height, not min-height, we can now use max-height (once again applied with a delay) to set the pseudo-element\'s actual height to zero once the transition is over, ensuring that at least outside the transition, even small elements have the correct height. Because min-height is stronger than max-height, this wouldn\'t work if we used the container\'s min-height instead of the pseudo-element\'s height. Just like the max-height in the previous paragraph, this max-height also needs a value for the opposite end of the transition. But in this case we can just pick the 50px.Tested in Chrome (Win, Mac, Android, iOS), Firefox (Win, Mac, Android), Edge, IE11 (except for a flexbox layout issue with my demo that I didn\'t bother debugging), and Safari (Mac, iOS). Speaking of flexbox, it should be possible to make this work without using any flexbox; in fact I think you could make almost everything work in IE7 â€“ except for the fact that you won\'t have CSS transitions, making it a rather pointless exercise.Use max-height with different transition easing and delay for each state. HTML:CSS:See example: http://jsfiddle.net/0hnjehjc/1/Ok, so I think I came up with a super simple answer...\nno max-height, uses relative positioning, works on li elements, & is pure CSS.\nI have not tested in anything but Firefox, though judging by the CSS, it should work on all browsers.FIDDLE: http://jsfiddle.net/n5XfG/2596/CSSHTMLAs I post this there are over 30 answers already, but I feel my answer improves on the already accepted answer by jake.I was not content with the issue that arises from simply using max-height and CSS3 transitions, since as many commenters noted, you have to set your max-height value very close to the actual height or you\'ll get a delay. See this JSFiddle for an example of that problem.To get around this (while still using no JavaScript), I added another HTML element that transitions the transform: translateY CSS value.This means both max-height and translateY are used: max-height allows the element to push down elements below it, while translateY gives the "instant" effect we want. The issue with max-height still exists, but its effect is lessened.\nThis means you can set a much larger height for your max-height value and worry about it less.The overall benefit is that on the transition back in (the collapse), the user sees the translateY animation immediately, so it doesn\'t really matter how long the max-height takes.Solution as FiddleNo hard coded valuesNo javascriptNo approximationsThe trick is to use a hidden & duplicated div to get the browser to understand what 100% means. This method is suitable whenever you\'re able to duplicate the DOM of the element you wish to animate. You can transition from height:0 to height:auto providing that you also provide min-height and max-height.EDIT: Scroll down for updated answer \nI was making a drop down list and saw this Post ... many different answers but I decide to share my drop down list too, ... It\'s not perfect but at least it will using only css for drop down! I\'ve been using transform:translateY(y) to transform the list to the view ...\nYou can see more in the test \nhttp://fiddle.jshell.net/BVEpc/4/ \nI\'ve placed div behind every li because my drop down list are coming from up and to show them properly this was needed, my div code is:and hover is : and because ul height is set to the content it can get over your body content that\'s why I did this for ul:and hover:the second time after transition is delay and it will get hidden after my drop down list has been closed animately ... \nHope later someone get benefit of this one.\n\nEDIT: I just can\'t believe ppl actually using this prototype! this drop down menu is only for one sub menu and that\'s all!!\nI\'ve updated a better one that can have two sub menu for both ltr and rtl direction with IE 8 support. \nFiddle for LTR \nFiddle for RTL \nhopefully someone find this useful in future.I think I came up with a really solid solutionOK! I know this problem is as old as the internet but I think I have a solution which I turned into a plugin called mutant-transition. My solution sets the style="" attributes for tracked elements whenever theres a change in the DOM. the end result is that you can use good ole CSS for your transitions and not use hacky fixes or special javascript. The only thing you have to do is set what you want to track on the element in question using data-mutant-attributes="X". Thats it! This solution uses MutationObserver to follow changes in the DOM. Because of this, you don\'t really have to set anything up or use javascript to manually animate things. Changes are tracked automatically. However, because it uses MutationObserver, this will only transition in IE11+. \n\nFiddles!There was little mention of the Element.scrollHeight property which can be useful here and still may be used with a pure CSS transition. The property always contains the "full" height of an element, regardless of whether and how its content overflows as a result of collapsed height (e.g. height: 0).As such, for a height: 0 (effectively fully collapsed) element, its "normal" or "full" height is still readily available through its scrollHeight value (invariably a pixel length).For such an element, assuming it already has the transition set up like e.g. (using ul as per original question):We can trigger desired animated "expansion" of height, using CSS only, with something like the following (here assuming ul variable refers to the list):That\'s it. If you need to collapse the list, either of the two following statements will do:My particular use case revolved around animating lists of unknown and often considerable lengths, so I was not comfortable settling on an arbitrary "large enough" height or max-height specification and risking cut-off content or content that you suddenly need to scroll (if overflow: auto, for example). Additionally, the easing and timing is broken with max-height-based solutions, because the used height may reach its maximum value a lot sooner than it would take for max-height to reach 9999px. And as screen resolutions grow, pixel lengths like 9999px leave a bad taste in my mouth. This particular solution solves the problem in an elegant manner, in my opinion.Finally, here is hoping that future revisions of CSS address authors need to do these kind of things even more elegantly -- revisit the notion of "computed" vs "used" and "resolved" values, and consider whether transitions should apply to computed values, including transitions with width and height (which currently get a bit of a special treatment).Here\'s a way to transition from any starting height, including 0, to auto (full size and flexible) without requiring hard-set code on a per-node basis or any user-code to initialize: https://github.com/csuwildcat/transition-auto. This is basically the holy grail for what you want, I believe --> http://codepen.io/csuwldcat/pen/kwsdF. Just slap the following JS file into your page, and all you need to do after that is add/remove a single boolean attribute - reveal="" - from the nodes you want to expand and contract.Here\'s all you need to do as the user, once you include the code block found below the example code:Here\'s the code block to include in your page, after that, it\'s all gravy:Drop this JS file in your page - it all Just Works\xe2\x84\xa2/* Code for height: auto; transitioning *//* Code for DEMO */Jake\'s answer to animate the max-height is great, but I found the delay caused by setting a large max-height annoying.One could move the collapsable content into an inner div and calculate the max height by getting the height of the inner div (via JQuery it\'d be the outerHeight()).Here\'s a jsfiddle link: http://jsfiddle.net/pbatey/duZpTHere\'s a jsfiddle with the absolute minimal amount of code required: http://jsfiddle.net/8ncjjxh8/I realize this thread is getting old, but it ranks high on certain Google searches so I figure it\'s worth updating.You also just get/set the element\'s own height:You should dump this Javascript immediately after target_box\'s closing tag in an inline script tag.Here\'s a solution I just used in combination with jQuery. This works for the following HTML structure:and the function:You could then use a click function to set and remove the height using css()CSS:Expanding on @jake\'s answer, the transition will go all the way to the max height value, causing an extremely fast animation - if you set the transitions for both :hover and off you can then control the crazy speed a little bit more.So the li:hover is when the mouse enters the state and then the transition on the non-hovered property will be the mouse leave.Hopefully this will be of some help.e.g: Here\'s a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/BukwJ/I was able to do this. I have a .child & a .parent div. The child div fits perfectly within the parent\'s width/height with absolute positioning. I then animate the translate property to push it\'s Y value down 100%. Its very smooth animation, no glitches or down sides like any other solution here.Something like this, pseudo codeYou would specify a height on .parent, in px, %, or leave as auto. This div then masks out the .child div when it slides down.I\'ve recently been transitioning the max-height on the li elements rather than the wrapping ul.The reasoning is that the delay for small max-heights is far less noticeable (if at all) compared to large max-heights, and I can also set my max-height value relative to the font-size of the li rather than some arbitrary huge number by using ems or rems.If my font size is 1rem, I\'ll set my max-height to something like 3rem (to accommodate wrapped text). You can see an example here:http://codepen.io/mindfullsilence/pen/DtzjEI have not read everything in detail but I have had this problem recently and I did what follows:This allows you to have a div that at first shows content up to 200px height and on hover it\'s size becomes at least as high as the whole content of the div. The Div does not become 3000px but 3000px is the limit that I am imposing. Make sure to have the transition on the non :hover, otherwise you might get some strange rendering. In this way the :hover inherits from the non :hover. Transition does not work form px to % or to auto. You need to use same unit of measure.\nThis works fine for me. Using HTML5 makes it perfect....Remember that there is always a work around... ; )Hope someone finds this usefulI believe the height:auto/max-height solution will only work if you\'re expanding area is greater than the height you want to restrict.If you have a max-height of 300px, but a combo box dropdown, which can return 50px, then max-height won\'t help you, 50px is variable depending on the number of elements, you can arrive to an impossible situation where I can\'t fix it because the height is not fixed, height:auto was the solution, but I can\'t use transitions with this.Set the height to auto and transition the max-height.Tested on Chrome v17The max-height solution from Jake works well, if the hard-coded\nmax-height value supplied is not much bigger than the real height\n(because otherwise there are undesirable delays and timing problems).\nOn the other hand if the hard-coded value accidentially is \nnot bigger than the real height the element won\'t open up completely.The following CSS only solution also requires a hard-coded size that\nshould be bigger than most of the occurring real sizes.  However this\nsolution also works if the real size is in some situations bigger than\nthe hard-coded size. In that event the transition might jump a bit,\nbut it will never leave a partially visible element.\nSo this solution could also be used for unknown content, e.g. from\na database, where you just know that the content is usually not bigger\nthan x pixels, but there are exceptions.Idea is to use a negative value for margin-bottom (or margin-top for a\nslightly diffenrent animation) and to place the content element into a\nmiddle element with overflow:hidden. The negative margin of the content\nelement so reduces the height of the middle element.The following code uses a transition on margin-bottom from -150px to\n0px.  This alone works fine as long as the content element is not\nhigher than 150px. In addition it uses a transition on max-height for the\nmiddle element from 0px to 100%.  This finally hides the middle element\nif the content element is higher than 150px.\nFor max-height the transition is just used to delay its application\nby a second when closing, not for a smooth visiual effect (\nand therefore it can run from  0px to 100%).CSS:HTML:The value for margin bottom should be negative and as close as\npossible to the real height of the content element. If it(\'s absoute\nvalue) is bigger there are similar delay and timing problems as with\nthe max-height solutions, which however can be limited as long as the\nhard coded size is not much bigger than the real one. If the absolute\nvalue for margin-bottom is smaller than the real height the \ntansition jumps a bit. In any case after the transition the\ncontent element is either fully displayed or fully removed.For more details see my blog post http://www.taccgl.org/blog/css_transition_display.html#combined_heightThis isn\'t exactly a "solution" to the problem, but more of a workaround. It only works as written with text, but can be changed to work with other elements as needed I\'m sure.Here is an example: http://codepen.io/overthemike/pen/wzjRKaEssentially, you set the font-size to 0 and transition that instead of the height, or max-height, or scaleY() etc. at a quick enough pace to get the height to transform to what you want. To transform the actual height with CSS to auto isn\'t currently possible, but transforming the content within is, hence the font-size transition.There seems to be no proper solution. max-height approach is quite good but doesn\'t work well for the hide phase - there will be a noticeable delay unless you know the height of the content. I think the best way is to use max-height but only for the show phase. And not to use any animation on hiding. For most cases it shouldn\'t be crucial. max-height should be set to a quite huge value to ensure any content fits. Animation speed can be controlled using transition duration (speed = max-height / duration). Speed does not depend on the size of the content. The time it takes to show the whole content will depend on its size.
