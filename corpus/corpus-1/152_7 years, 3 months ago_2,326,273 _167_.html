In Java you can use a for loop to traverse objects in an array as follows:Can you do the same in JavaScript?Use a sequential for loop:@zipcodeman suggests the use of the for...in statement, but for iterating arrays for-in should be avoided, that statement is meant to enumerate object properties.It shouldn\'t be used for array-like objects because:The second point is that it can give you a lot of problems, for example, if you extend the Array.prototype object to include a method there, that property will be also enumerated.For example:The above code will alert, "a", "b", "c" and "foo!".That be particularly a problem if you use some library that relies heavily on native prototypes augmention (such as MooTools for example).The for-in statement as I said before is there to enumerate object properties, for example:In the above example the hasOwnProperty method allows you to enumerate only own properties, that\'s it, only the properties that the object physically has, no inherited properties.I would recommend you to read the following article:Yes, but only if your implementation includes the for...of feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (the "Harmony" release).It works like this:Or better yet, since ECMAScript 2015 also provides block-scoped variables via let and const:Many JavaScript developers are still working in an environment that\'s not there yet, however - especially if writing code to run in web browsers, where the site developers often can\'t be sure what browser/version their clients will be using.If you can assume the JavaScript interpreter is compliant with the previous edition of the ECMAScript specification (which rules out, for example, versions of Internet Explorer before 9), then you can use the forEach iterator method instead of a loop. In that case, you pass a function to be called on each item in the array:But if even that is too much to assume, and you want something that works in all versions of JavaScript, then you have to use an explicit counting loop.  The safest version, which handles sparse arrays properly, is something like this:Assigning the length value to the local variable (as opposed to including the full myStringArray.length expression in the loop condition) can make a significant difference in performance since it skips a property lookup each time through; using Rhino on my machine, the speedup is 43%. You will often see the length caching done in the loop initialization clause, like this:The for...in syntax mentioned by others is for looping over an object\'s properties; since an Array in JavaScript is just an object with numeric property names (and an automatically-updated length property), you can theoretically loop over an Array with it.  But the problem is that it doesn\'t restrict itself to the numeric property values (remember that even methods are actually just properties whose value is a closure), nor does it iterate over those in numeric order. Therefore, the for...in syntax should not be used for looping through Arrays. You can use map (also known as apply in other languages like Python, and probably Haskell too)The general syntax is:func should take one parameter.The return value of array.map is another array, so you can use it like this:And now x is [10,20,30,40].I must clarify: This concept is from the functional paradigm.You don\'t have to write the function inline; one might do so as a first sketch, but you could then extract it into its own function.which would be sort-of equivalent to:except you don\'t get the new_list.In JavaScript it\'s not advisable to loop through an Array with a for-in loop, but it\'s better using a for loop such as:It\'s optimized as well ("caching" the array length). If you\'d like to learn more, read my post on the subject.(Directly answering your question: now you can!)Most other answers are right, but they do not mention (as of this writing) that ECMA Script  6  2015 is bringing a new mechanism for doing iteration, the for..of loop. This new syntax is the most elegant way to iterate an array in javascript (as long you don\'t need the iteration index), but it is not yet widely supported by the browsers. It currently works with Firefox 13+, Chrome 37+ and it does not natively work with other browsers (see browser compatibility below). Luckily we have JS compilers (such as Babel) that allow us to use next-generation features today.It also works on Node (I tested it on version 0.12.0).Iterating an arrayIterating an array of objectsIterating a generator:(example extracted from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)Compatibility table:\nhttp://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/es6/#For..of loopsSpec: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:iteratorsOpera, Safari, Firefox and Chrome now all share a set of enhanced Array methods for optimizing many common loops.You may not need all of them, but they can be very useful, or would be if every browser supported them.Mozilla Labs published the algorithms they and WebKit both use, so that you can add them yourself.filter returns an array of items that satisfy some condition or test.every returns true if every array member passes the test.some returns true if any pass the test.forEach runs a function on each array member and doesn\'t return anything.map is like forEach, but it returns an array of the results of the operation for each element.These methods all take a function for their first argument and have an optional second argument, which is an object whose scope you want to impose on the array members as they loop through the function.Ignore it until you need it.indexOf and lastIndexOf find the appropriate position of the first or last element that matches its argument exactly.Use the while loop...logs: \'one\',\'two\',\'three\'And for the reverse order, an even more efficient looplogs: \'three\',\'two\',\'one\'Or the classical for looplogs: \'one\',\'two\',\'three\'Reference:\nhttp://www.sitepoint.com/google-closure-how-not-to-write-javascript/If you want a terse way to write a fast loop and you can iterate in reverse:This has the benefit of caching the length (similar to for (var i=0, len=myArray.length; i<len; ++i) and unlike for (var i=0; i<myArray.length; ++i)) while being fewer characters to type.There are even some times when you ought to iterate in reverse, such as when iterating over a live NodeList where you plan on removing items from the DOM during iteration.Since my time in college, I\'ve programmed in Java, JavaScript, Pascal, ABAP, PHP, Progress 4GL, C/C++ and possibly a few other languages I can\'t think of right now.While they all have their own linguistic idiosyncrasies, each of these languages share many of the same basic concepts. Such concepts include procedures / functions, IF-statements, FOR-loops, and WHILE-loops.A traditional for loop has three components:These three components are separated from each other by a ; symbol. Content for each of these three components is optional, which means that the following is the most minimal for loop possible:Of course, you will need to include an if(condition === true) { break; }  or an if(condition === true) { return; } somewhere inside that for-loop to get it to stop running.Usually, though, the initialization is used to declare an index, the condition is used to compare that index with a minimum or maximum value, and the afterthought is used to increment the index:The traditional way to loop through an array, is this:Or, if you prefer to loop backwards, you do this:There are, however, many variations possible, like for example this one:... or this one ...... or this one:Whichever works best is largely a matter of both personal taste and the specific use case you\'re implementing.Note that each of these variations is supported by all browsers, including very very old ones!One alternative to a for loop is a while loop. To loop through an array, you could do this:Like traditional for loops, while loops are supported by even the oldest of browsers.Also, note that every while loop can be rewritten as a for loop. For example, the while loop hereabove behaves the exact same way as this for-loop:In JavaScript, you can also do this:This should be used with care, however, as it doesn\'t behave the same as a traditional for loop in all cases, and there are potential side-effects that need to be considered. See Why is using "for...in" with array iteration a bad idea? for more details.As an alternative to for...in, there\'s now also for for...of. The following example shows the difference between a for...of loop and a for...in loop:Additionally, you need to consider that no version of Internet Explorer supports for...of (Edge 12+ does) and that for...in requires at least Internet Explorer 10.An alternative to for-loops is Array.prototype.forEach(), which uses the following syntax:Array.prototype.forEach() is supported by all modern browsers, as well as Internet Explorer 9 and later.Finally, many utility libraries also have their own foreach variation. AFAIK, the three most popular ones are these:jQuery.each(), in jQuery:_.each(), in Underscore.js:_.forEach(), in Lodash.js:I would thoroughly recommend making use of the underscore.js library. It provides you with various functions that you can use to iterate over arrays/collections.For instance:There is a way to do it where you have very little implicit scope in your loop and do away with extra variables.Or if you really want to get the id and have a really classical for loop:Modern browsers all support iterator methods forEach, map, reduce, filter and a host of other methods on the Array prototype. There are various way to loop through array in JavaScript.  Generic loop:ES5\'s forEach:jQuery.each:Have a look this for detailed information or you can also check MDN for looping through an array in JavaScript & using jQuery check jQuery for each.Array loop:Object loop:If you\'re using the jQuery library, consider using \nhttp://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/From the documentation:jQuery.each( collection, callback(indexInArray, valueOfElement) ) Returns: ObjectDescription: A generic iterator function, which can be used to\n  seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like\n  objects with a length property (such as a function\'s arguments object)\n  are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are\n  iterated via their named properties.The $.each() function is not the same as $(selector).each(), which is\n  used to iterate, exclusively, over a jQuery object. The $.each()\n  function can be used to iterate over any collection, whether it is a\n  map (JavaScript object) or an array. In the case of an array, the\n  callback is passed an array index and a corresponding array value each\n  time. (The value can also be accessed through the this keyword, but\n  Javascript will always wrap the this value as an Object even if it is\n  a simple string or number value.) The method returns its first\n  argument, the object that was iterated.I did not yet see this variation, which I personally like the best:Given an array:You can loop over it without ever accessing the length property:See this JsFiddle demonstrating that: http://jsfiddle.net/prvzk/This only works for arrays that are not sparse. Meaning that there actually is a value at each index in the array. However, I found that in practice I hardly ever use sparse arrays in Javascript... In such cases it\'s usually a lot easier to use an object as a map/hashtable. If you do have a sparse array, and want to loop over 0 .. length-1, you need the for (var i=0; i<someArray.length; ++i) construct, but you still need an if inside the loop to check whether the element at the current index is actually defined.Also, as CMS mentions in a comment below, you can only use this on arrays that don\'t contain any falsish values. The array of strings from the example works, but if you have empty strings, or numbers that are 0 or NaN, etc. the loop will break off prematurely. Again in practice this is hardly ever a problem for me, but it is something to keep in mind, which makes this a loop to think about before you use it... That may disqualify it for some people :)What I like about this loop is:The reason this works is that the array specification mandates that when you read an item from an index >= the array\'s length, it will return undefined. When you write to such a location it will actually update the length.For me, this construct most closely emulates the Java 5 syntax that I love:... with the added benefit of also knowing about the current index inside the loopThere are a couple of ways to do it in JavaScript. The first two examples are JavaScript samples. The third one makes use of a JavaScript library, that is, jQuery making use of the .each() function.http://jsperf.com/native-loop-performance/8Comparing methods for looping through an array of 100000 items and do a minimal operation with the new value each time.Preparation:Tests:There\'s a method to iterate over only own object properties, not including prototype\'s ones:but it still will iterate over custom-defined properties.In javascript any custom property could be assigned to any object including array.If one wants to iterate over sparsed array, for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) if (i in array) or array.forEach with es5shim should be used.In JavaScript, there are so many solutions to loop an array.The code below are popular onesThe optimized approach is to cache the length of array and using single var pattern initializing all variables with single var keyword.If order of iteration does not matter than you should try reversed loop, it is fastest as it reduce overhead condition testing and decrement is in one statement:or better and cleaner to use while loop:The best way in my opinion is to use the Array.forEach function. If you cannot use that I would suggest to get the polyfill from MDN to make i available, it is certainly the safest way to iterate over an array in JavaScript.https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEachSo as others has suggested, this is almost always what you want:This ensures that anything you need in the scope of processing the array stays within that scope, and that you are only processing the values of the array, not the object properties and other members, which is what for .. in does. using a regular c style for loop works in most cases, it is just important to remember that everything within the loop shares it\'s scope with the rest of your program, the { } does not create a new scope. Hence:will output "11" - which may or may not be what you want.

They may do things much faster and better than using while and for.This is good article if you like to learn more about the async functions over arrays in JavaScript.Functional programming has been making quite a splash in the\n  development world these days. And for good reason: Functional\n  techniques can help you write more declarative code that is easier to\n  understand at a glance, refactor, and test.One of the cornerstones of functional programming is its special use\n  of lists and list operations. And those things are exactly what the\n  sound like they are: arrays of things, and the stuff you do to them.\n  But the functional mindset treats them a bit differently than you\n  might expect.This article will take a close look at what I like to call the "big\n  three" list operations: map, filter, and reduce. Wrapping your head\n  around these three functions is an important step towards being able\n  to write clean functional code, and opens the doors to the vastly\n  powerful techniques of functional and reactive programming.It also means you\'ll never have to write a for loop again.Read more>> here:For example, I used in a Firefox console:Short answer: yes.
