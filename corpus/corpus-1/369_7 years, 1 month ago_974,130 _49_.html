How can I get windowWidth, windowHeight, pageWidth, pageHeight, screenWidth, screenHeight, pageX, pageY, screenX, screenY which will work in all major browsers?If you are using jQuery, you can get the size of the window or the document using jQuery methods:For screen size you can use the screen object in the following way:This is everything you need to know: http://andylangton.co.uk/articles/javascript/get-viewport-size-javascript/but in short:FiddleHere is a cross browser solution with pure JavaScript (Source): A non-jQuery way to get the available screen dimension. window.screen.width/height has already been put up, but for responsive webdesign and completeness sake I think its worth to mention those attributes:http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_cssom.html#t10 :availWidth and availHeight - The available width and height on the\n  screen (excluding OS taskbars and such).But when we talk about responsive screens and if we want to handle it using jQuery for some reason, gives the correct measurement. Even it removes the scroll-bar\'s extra space and we don\'t need to worry about adjusting that space :) You can also get the WINDOW width and height, avoiding browser toolbars and other stuff. It is the real usable area in browser\'s window.To do this, use:\nwindow.innerWidth  and  window.innerHeight properties (see doc at w3schools).In most cases it will be the best way, in example, to display a perfectly centred floating modal dialog. It allows you to calculate positions on window, no matter which resolution orientation or window size is using the browser.To check height and width of your current loaded page of any website using "console" or after clicking "Inspect".step 1:  Click the right button of mouse and click on \'Inspect\' and then click \'console\'step 2: Make sure that your browser screen should be not in \'maximize\' mode. If the browser screen is in \'maximize\' mode, you need to first click the maximize button (present either at right or left top corner) and un-maximize it. step 3: Now, write the following after the greater than sign (\'>\') i.e. If you need a truly bulletproof solution for the document width and height (the pageWidth and pageHeight in the picture), you might want to consider using a plugin of mine, jQuery.documentSize. It has just one purpose: to always return the correct document size, even in scenarios when jQuery and other methods fail. Despite its name, you don\'t necessarily have to use jQuery \xe2\x80\x93 it is written in vanilla Javascript and works without jQuery, too.Usage:for the global document. For other documents, e.g. in an embedded iframe you have access to, pass the document as a parameter:Update: now for window dimensions, tooEver since version 1.1.0, jQuery.documentSize also handles window dimensions.That is necessary because jQuery.documentSize provides $.windowWidth() and $.windowHeight(), which solve these issues. For more, please check out the documentation.I wrote a small javascript bookmarklet you can use to display the size. You can  easily add it to your browser and whenever you click it you will see the size in the right corner of your browser window.Here you find information how to use a bookmarklet \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet The original code is in coffee:Basically the code is prepending a small div which updates when you resize your window.I developed a library for knowing the real viewport size for desktops and mobiles browsers, because viewport sizes are inconsistents across devices and cannot rely on all the answers of that post (according to all the research I made about this) : https://github.com/pyrsmk/WSometimes you need to see the width/height changes while resizing the window and inner content.For that I\'ve written a little script that adds a log box that dynamicly monitors all the resizing and almost immediatly updates.It adds a valid HTML with fixed position and high z-index, but is small enough, so you can:Tested on: Chrome 40, IE11, but it is highly possible to work on other/older browsers too ... :)EDIT: Now styles are applied only to logger table element - not to all tables - also this is a jQuery-free solution :)In some cases related with responsive layout $(document).height() can return wrong data that displays view port height only. \nFor example when some div#wrapper has height:100%, that #wrapper can be stretched by some block inside it. But it\'s height still will be like viewport height. In such situation you might useThat represents actual size of wrapper.You can use the Screen object to get this.The following is an example of what it would return:To get your screenWidth variable, just use screen.width, same with screenHeight, you would just use screen.height.To get your window width and height, it would be screen.availWidth or screen.availHeight respectively.For the pageX and pageY variables, use window.screenX or Y. Note that this is from the VERY LEFT/TOP OF YOUR LEFT/TOP-est SCREEN. So if you have two screens of width 1920 then a window 500px from the left of the right screen would have an X value of 2420 (1920+500). screen.width/height, however, display the CURRENT screen\'s width or height.To get the width and height of your page, use jQuery\'s $(window).height() or $(window).width().Again using jQuery, use $("html").offset().top and $("html").offset().left for your pageX and pageY values.
