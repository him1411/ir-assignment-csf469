On git, how could I compare the same file between two different commits (not contiguous) on the same branch (master for example)?I\'m searching for a Compare feature like the one in VSS or TFS, is it possible in Git? From the git-diff manpage:For instance, to see the difference for a file "main.c" between now and two commits back, here are three equivalent commands:You can also compare two different files in two different revisions, like this:git diff <revision_1>:<file_1> <revision_2>:<file_2>If you have configured the "difftool" you can useExample: Comparing a file from its last commit to its previous commit on the same branch:\nAssuming that if you are in your project root folderYou should have the following entries in your ~/.gitconfig or in project/.git/config file. Install the p4merge [This is my preferred diff and merge tool]If you want to see all changes to the file between the two commits on a commit-by-commit basis, you can also dogit log -u $start_commit..$end_commit -- path/to/fileCheck $ git log, then copy SHA id of 2 different commits and then run git diff command with those ids, for example:Here is a perl script that prints out git diff commands for a given file as found in a git log command.e.g.Yields:which could then be cut N pasted in a shell window session or piped to /bin/sh.Notes:Code:If you want to make a diff with more than one file, with the method specified by @mipadi:E.g. diff between HEAD and your master, to find all .coffee files:This will recursively search your your_search_folder/ for all .coffee files and make a diff between them and their master versions.Just another way to use git\'s awesomeness ... If you have several files or directories and want to compare non continuous commits, you could do this:Make a temporal branchRewind to the first commit targetCherry picking on those commit interestedApply diffWhen you doneIf you want a simple visual comparison on Windows such as you can get in VSS or TFS, try this:The Git GUI tool will start, with a history of the file in the top left pane. Select one of the versions you would like to compare. Then right-click on the second version and choose either Diff this -> selected or Diff selected -> thisColour-coded differences will appear in the lower left-hand pane.
