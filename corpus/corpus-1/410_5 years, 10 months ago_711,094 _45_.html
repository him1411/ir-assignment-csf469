How does the variable propt represent the properties of the object? It\'s not a built-in method, or property. Then why does it come up with every property in the object?Iterating over properties requires this additional hasOwnProperty check: It\'s necessary because an object\'s prototype contains additional properties for the object which are technically part of the object. These additional properties are inherited from the base object class, but are still properties of object.hasOwnProperty simply checks to see if this is a property specific to this class, and not one inherited from the base class.As of JavaScript 1.8.5 you can use Object.keys(obj) to get an Array of properties defined on the object itself (the ones that return true for obj.hasOwnProperty(key)).This is better (and readable) than using for-in loop.Its supported on these browsers: See the Mozilla Developer Network Object.keys()\'s reference for futher information.It\'s the for...in statement (MDN, ECMAScript spec).You can read it as "FOR every property IN the obj object, assign each property to the PROPT variable in turn".Girls and guys we are in 2017 and we do not have that much time for typing... So lets do this cool new fancy ECMAScript 2016:It\'s just a for...in loop. Check out the documentation at Mozilla.In upcoming versions of ES, you can use Object.entries:orIf you just want to iterate over the values, then use Object.values:orjquery allows you to do this now:You can use Lodash. The documentation Nowadays you can convert a standard JS object into an iterable object just by adding a Symbol.iterator method. Then you can use a for of loop and acceess its values directly or even can use a spread operator on the object too. Cool. Let\'s see how we can make it:Your for loop is iterating over all of the properties of the object obj. propt is defined in the first line of your for loop. It is a string that is a name of a property of the obj object. In the first iteration of the loop, propt would be "name".Objects in JavaScript are collections of properties and can therefore be looped in a for each statement. You should think of obj as an key value collection.Also adding the recursive way:Usage:The for...in loop represents each property in an object because it is just like a for loop. You defined propt in the for...in loop by doing:A for...in loop iterates through the enumerable properties of an object. Whichever variable you define, or put in the for...in loop, changes each time it goes to the next property it iterates. The variable in the for...in loop iterates through the keys, but the value of it is the key\'s value. For example:You can see how the variable differs from the variable\'s value. In contrast, a for...of loop does the opposite.I hope this helps.I want to add to the answers above, because you might have different intentions from Javascript.  A JSON object and a Javascript object are different things, and you might want to iterate through the properties of a JSON object using the solutions proposed above, and then be surprised. Suppose that you have a JSON object like:The wrong way to iterate through its \'properties\':You might be surprised of seeing the console logging 0, 1, etc. when iterating through the properties of prop1 and prop2 and of prop3_1. Those objects are sequences, and the indexes of a sequence are properties of that object in Javascript.A better way to recursively iterate through a JSON object properties would be to first check if that object is a sequence or not:Here I am iterating each node and creating meaningful node names. If you notice, instanceOf Array and instanceOf Object pretty much does the same thing (in my application, i am giving different logic though)note - I am inspired by Ondrej Svejdar\'s answer. But this solution has better performance and less ambiguousYou basically want to loop through each property in the object.JSFiddleIf running Node I\'d recommend:To further refine the accepted answer it\'s worth noting that if you instantiate the object with a var object = Object.create(null) then object.hasOwnProperty(property) will trigger a TypeError. So to be on the safe side, you\'d need to call it from the prototype like this:You can use it to get or set value of object or array having objects. https://jsfiddle.net/narendra_globalsysinfo/yt97dbm5/It will return the same object with value set to defaultDefaults are:\n for int is 0, for string is \'\' and for boolean is falseNote: object having function as property will not be reset, you can make change as per requirements and thanks me.What for..in loop does is that it creates a new variable (var someVariable) and then stores each property of the given object in this new variable(someVariable) one by one. Therefore if you use block {}, you can iterate. Consider the following example.
