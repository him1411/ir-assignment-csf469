I have a project in which I ran git init.\nAfter several commits, I did git status which told me everything was up to date and there were no local changes. Then I made several consecutive changes and realized I wanted to throw everything away and get back to my original state. Will this command do it for me?If you want to revert changes made to your working copy, do this:If you want to revert changes made to the index (i.e., that you have added), do this. Warning this will reset all of your unpushed commits to master!:If you want to revert a change that you have committed, do this:If you want to remove untracked files (e.g., new files, generated files):Or untracked directories (e.g., new or automatically generated directories):  Note: You may also want to run aswill not remove untracked files, where as git-clean will remove any files from the tracked root directory that are not under git tracking. WARNING - BE CAREFUL WITH THIS! It is helpful to run a dry-run with git-clean first, to see what it will delete.This is also especially useful when you get the error messageWhich can occur when doing several things, one being updating a working copy when you and your friend have both added a new file of the same name, but he\'s committed it into source control first, and you don\'t care about deleting your untracked copy.In this situation, doing a dry run will also help show you a list of files that would be overwritten.Look into git-reflog.  It will list all the states it remembers (default is 30 days), and you can simply checkout the one you want.  For example:If you want to revert all changes AND be up-to-date with the current remote master (for example you find that the master HEAD has moved forward since you branched off it and your push is being \'rejected\') you can useDANGER AHEAD: (please read the comments. Executing the command proposed in my answer might delete more than you want)to completely remove all files including directories I had to runAfter reading a bunch of answers and trying them, I\'ve found various edge cases that mean sometimes they don\'t fully clean the working copy. Here\'s my current bash script for doing it, which works all the time.Run from working copy root directory.I met a similar problem.\nThe solution is to use git log to look up which version of the local commit is different from the remote. (E.g. the version is 3c74a11530697214cbcc4b7b98bf7a65952a34ec).Then use git reset --hard 3c74a11530697214cbcc4b7b98bf7a65952a34ec to revert the change.simply sayit will remove all your local chages. and you also can use later by sayingFollowing are other commands I forget daily.Test case for confirming all the above (use bash or sh):See alsoYou may not necessarily want/need to stash your work/files in your working directory but instead simply get rid of them completely. The command git clean will do this for you. Some common use cases for doing this would be to remove cruft that has been generated by merges or external tools or remove other files so that you can run a clean build. Keep in mind you will want to be very cautious of this command, since its designed to remove files from your local working directory that are NOT TRACKED. if you suddently change your mind after executing this command, there is no going back to see the content of the files that were removed. An alternative which is safer is to execute git stash --all which will remove everything but save it all in a stash. This stash can then later be used. However, if you truly DO want to remove all the files and clean your working directory, you should execute git clean -f -dThis will remove any files and also any sub-directories that don\'t have any items as a result of the command. A smart thing to do before executing the git clean -f -d command is to run which will show you a preview of what WILL be removed after executing git clean -f -dSo here is a summary of your options from most aggressive to least aggressiveOption 1: Remove all files locally(Most aggressive)Option 2: Preview the above impact(Preview most aggressive)Option 3: Stash all files (Least aggressive)Try this for revert all changes uncommited in local branchBut if you see a error like this:You can navigate to \'.git\' folder then delete index.lock file:Finaly, run again the command:I searched for a similar issue,  Wanted to throw away local commits:So did the below:  Check:  now local commits are lost, back to the initial cloned state, point 1 above.
