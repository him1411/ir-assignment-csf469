Is there a universal JavaScript function that checks that a variable has a value and ensures that it\'s not undefined or null? I\'ve got this code, but I\'m not sure if it covers all cases:You can just check if the variable has a truthy value or not. That meanswill evaluate to true if value is not:The above list represents all possible falsy values in ECMA-/Javascript. Find it in the specification at the ToBoolean section.Furthermore, if you do not know whether a variable exists (that means, if it was declared) you should check with the typeof operator. For instanceIf you can be sure that a variable is declared at least, you should directly check if it has a truthy value like shown above.Further read: http://typeofnan.blogspot.com/2011/01/typeof-is-fast.htmlJavaScript ninjas could use the == operator:This will return true forand zero argument functions since a function\'s length is the number of declared parameters it takes.To disallow the latter category, you might want to just check for blank stringsThe first answer with best rating is wrong. If value is undefined it will throw an exception in modern browsers. You have to use: or I know this is an old question, but this is the safest check and I haven\'t seen it posted here exactly like that:It will cover cases where value was never defined, and also any of these:P.S. no need for strict equality in typeof value != \'undefined\'You may find the following function useful: Or in ES7 (comment if further improvements)Results:! check for empty strings (""), null, undefined, false and the number 0 and NaN. Say, if a string is empty var name = "" then console.log(!name) returns true.this function will return true if val is empty, null, undefined, false, the number 0 or NaN.You are a bit overdoing it. To check if a variable is not given a value, you would only need to check against undefined and null.This is assuming 0, "", and objects(even empty object and array) are valid "values".Here\'s mine - returns true if value is null, undefined, etc or blank (ie contains only blank spaces):If you prefer plain javascript try this:Otherwise, if you are already using underscore or lodash, try:If the variable hasn\'t been declared, you wont be able to test for undefined using a function because you will get an error. Both will generate an error if foo has not been declared.If you want to test if a variable has been declared you can useif you want to test if foo has been declared and it has a value you can useyou can use:If clause to validate if the string or value is not empty.\nlike this:This is a very simple one.To check Default Valuecheck Result:I used @Vix function() to check the object of which type.using instansof \xc2\xabThis will check if variable of indeterminate nesting is undefinedThe above checks if the Google translate function TranslateElement exists.  This is equivalent to:This condition checkis all you need.This will never throw an error. If myObject, child, or myValue is null then myNewValue will be null. No errors will be thrownI think using the ? operator is slightly cleaner.Although an oldie, what forget is that they should wrap their code block and then catch the error and then test...So you really don\'t have to check for a potential problem before hand, you simply catch it and then deal with it how you want.but this solution is over-engineered, if you dont\'want to modify the function later for busines-model needings, then is cleaner to use it directly in code:For my case I tried with if null,\'\', !variable, But it did not work.See my code below to get the text from an html fieldif there was no value(no text) in the status variable ,I was trying to set the value \'novalue\' to status variable. the following code worked.when there was no text found for satus variable the above code assigned \'novalue\' to the status variable
