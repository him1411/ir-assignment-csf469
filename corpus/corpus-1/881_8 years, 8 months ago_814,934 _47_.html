Is there any method to generate MD5 hash of a string in Java?java.security.MessageDigest is your friend. Call getInstance("MD5") to get an MD5 message digest you can use.The MessageDigest class can provide you with an instance of the MD5 digest.When working with strings and the crypto classes be sure to always specify the encoding you want the byte representation in. If you just use string.getBytes() it will use the platform default. (Not all platforms use the same defaults)If you have a lot of data take a look at the .update(byte[]) method which can be called repeatedly. Then call .digest() to obtain the resulting hash.If you actually want the answer back as a string as opposed to a byte array, you could always do something like this:You might also want to look at the DigestUtils class of the apache commons codec project, which provides very convenient methods to create MD5 or SHA digests.Found this:on the site below, I take no credit for it, but its a solution that works!\nFor me lots of other code didnt work properly, I ended up missing 0s in the hash.\nThis one seems to be the same as PHP has.\nsource: http://m2tec.be/blog/2010/02/03/java-md5-hex-0093Here is how I use it:where Hex is: org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex from the Apache Commons project.I just downloaded commons-codec.jar and got perfect php like md5. Here is manual.Just import it to your project and useand there you have it.I\'ve found this to be the most clear and concise way to do it:Found this solution which is much cleaner in terms of getting a String representation back from an MD5 hash.The code was extracted from here.Another option is to use the Guava Hashing methods:Handy if you are already using Guava (which if you\'re not, you probably should be).I have a Class (Hash) to convert plain text in hash in formats: md5 or sha1, simillar that php functions (md5, sha1):https://github.com/fitorec/java-hashesAnother implementation:My not very revealing answer:Bombe\'s answer is correct, however note that unless you absolutely must use MD5 (e.g. forced on you for interoperability), a better choice is SHA1 as MD5 has weaknesses for long term use.I should add that SHA1 also has theoretical vulnerabilities, but not as severe. The current state of the art in hashing is that there are a number of candidate replacement hash functions but none have yet emerged as the standard best practice to replace SHA1. So, depending on your needs you would be well advised to make your hash algorithm configurable so it can be replaced in future.No need to make it too complicated. DigestUtils works fine and make you comfortable while working with md5 hashes.orEither you can use any other encryption methods such as sha or md.There is a DigestUtils class in Spring also:http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/DigestUtils.htmlThis class contains the method md5DigestAsHex() that does the job. You can try following. See details and download codes here: http://www.luyue.org/java-hashgenerator-md5-sha-1/Another implementation: Fast MD5 Implementation in JavaI do not know if this is relevant for anyone reading this, but I just had the problem that I wanted toI wanted to do it with JRE classes only (no Apache Commons or similar). A quick web search did not show me sample code snippets doing both at the same time, only each task separately. Because this requires to read the same file twice, I figured it might be worth the while to write some code which unifies both tasks, calculating the checksum on the fly while downloading the file. This is my result (sorry if it is not perfect Java, but I guess you get the idea anyway):MD5 is perfectly fine if you don\'t need the best security, and if you\'re doing something like checking file integrity then security is not a consideration.  In such as case you might want to consider something simpler and faster, such as Adler32, which is also supported by the Java libraries.For what it\'s worth, I stumbled upon this because I want to synthesize GUIDs from a natural key for a program that will install COM components; I want to syhthesize so as not to manage GUID lifecycle. I\'ll use MD5 and then use the UUID class to get a string out of it. (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2190890/how-can-i-generate-guid-for-a-string-values/12867439 raises this issue).In any case, java.util.UUID can get you a nice String from the MD5 bytes.Take a look at the following link, the Example gets an MD5 Hash of a supplied image:\nMD5 Hash of an Imagethis one gives the exact md5 as you get from mysql\'s md5 function or php\'s md5 functions etc. This is the one I use (you can change according to your needs)Unlike PHP where you can do an md5 encryption of your text by just calling md5 function ie md5($text), in java it was made little bit complicated. I usually implemented it by calling an function which return the md5 hash text. \nHere is how I implemented it , First create a function named md5encryption inside your main class as given below . Now call the function when ever you needed as given below.Here you can see that hashtext is appended with a zero to make it match with md5 encryption in PHP. try this:This is what I came here for- a handy scala function that returns string of MD5 hash: There is an article on Codingkit about that. Check out: http://codingkit.com/a/JAVA/2013/1020/2216.htmlI did this... Seems to work ok - I\'m sure somebody will point out mistakes though...
