How do I determine if variable is undefined or null?  My code is as follows:But if I do this, the JavaScript interpreter halts execution.You can use the qualities of the abstract equality operator to do this:Because null == undefined is true, the above code will catch both null and undefined.The standard way to catch null and undefined simultaneously is this:--which is 100% equivalent to the more explicit but less concise:When writing professional JS, it\'s taken for granted that [type equality and the behavior of == vs ===][1] is understood. Therefore we use == and only compare to null.The comments suggesting the use of typeof are simply wrong. Yes, my solution above will cause a ReferenceError if the variable doesn\'t exist. This is a good thing. This ReferenceError is desirable: it will help you find your mistakes and fix them before you ship your code, just like compiler errors would in other languages.You should not have any references to undeclared variables in your code.Combining the above answers, it seems the most complete answer would be:This should work for any variable that is either undeclared or declared and explicitly set to null or undefined.  The boolean expression should evaluate to false for any declared variable that has an actual non-null value.will evaluate to true if value is not:nullundefinedNaNempty string ("")0falseUpdate:Checking undefined brings more confidence jQuery attr() function returns either a blank string or the actual value (and never null or undefined). The only time it returns undefined is when your selector didn\'t return any element.So you may want to test against a blank string. Alternatively, since blank strings, null and undefined are false-y, you can just do this:I like using this : It catches both null and undefinedIf the variable you want to check is a global, doThis way to check will not throw an error even if the yourVarName variable doesn\'t exist.window is an object which holds all global variables as its properties, and in JavaScript it is legal to try to access a non-existing object property. If history doesn\'t exist then window.history returns undefined. undefined is falsey, so code in an if(undefined){} block won\'t run.I\'ve come to write my own function for this... javascript is weirdUsable on literally anything. (Note that this also checks if the variable contains any usable values. But since this information is usually also needed, I think it\'s worth posting). Please consider leaving a note.Typescript-compatible.edit. this function should do exactly the same thing like PHPs empty() function (see RETURN VALUES)Considers undefined, null, false, 0, 0.0, "0" {}, [] as empty."0.0", NaN, " ", true are considered non-empty.Since you are using jQuery, you can determine whether a variable is undefined or its value is null by using a single function.I\'ve just had this problem i.e. checking if an object is null.\nI simply use this:i.e.jQuery check element not nullBest way:i run this test on chrome console,   using (void 0) you can check undefined  You can check if the value is undefined or null by simply using typeof:Calling typeof null returns a value of \xe2\x80\x9cobject\xe2\x80\x9d, as the special value null is considered to be an empty object reference. Safari through version 5 and Chrome through version 7 have a quirk where calling typeof on a regular expression returns \xe2\x80\x9cfunction\xe2\x80\x9d while all other browsers return \xe2\x80\x9cobject\xe2\x80\x9d.You can only use second one: as it will check for both definition and declarationTo test if a variable is null or undefined I use the below code.This is a very old question, but I still think the best/safe way to test these 2 conditions are to cast the value to string:if(x==null) is bad idea in javascript,judge with "==" may cause unexpected type coercion, and can\'t be read by coffee-script, \n never use "==" or "!=" in condition judgment!if(x) will be better.but becareful 0 and "", it will be treat as false,not equal method with "!= null" is true.https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_best_practices.aspMy 5 cents contribution for a specific case:The property is undefided not the element!
