Given this HTML & CSS: \nas a result, there will be a 4px wide space between the SPAN elements.\nDemo: http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/ I understand why this happens, and I also know that I could get rid of that space by removing the white-space between the SPAN elements in the HTML source code, like so: However, I was hoping for a CSS solution that doesn\'t require the HTML source code to be tampered with.I know how to solve this with JavaScript - by removing the Text nodes from the container element (the paragraph), like so: Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/1/ But can this issue be solved with CSS alone?Since this answer has become rather popular, I\'m rewriting it significantly.Let\'s not forget the actual question that was asked:How to remove the space between inline-block elements? I was hoping\n  for a CSS solution that doesn\'t require the HTML source code to be\n  tampered with. Can this issue be solved with CSS alone?It is possible to solve this problem with CSS alone, but there are no completely robust CSS fixes.The solution I had in my initial answer was to add font-size: 0 to the parent element, and then declare a sensible font-size on the children.http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/dGHFV/1361/This works in recent versions of all modern browsers. It works in IE8. It does not work in Safari 5, but it does work in Safari 6. Safari 5 is nearly a dead browser (0.33%, August 2015).Most of the possible issues with relative font sizes are not complicated to fix.However, while this is a reasonable solution if you specifically need a CSS only fix, it\'s not what I recommend if you\'re free to change your HTML (as most of us are).This is what I, as a reasonably experienced web developer, actually do to solve this problem:Yes, that\'s right. I remove the whitespace in the HTML between the inline-block elements.It\'s easy. It\'s simple. It works everywhere. It\'s the pragmatic solution.You do sometimes have to carefully consider where whitespace will come from. Will appending another element with JavaScript add whitespace? No, not if you do it properly.Let\'s go on a magical journey of different ways to remove the whitespace, with some new HTML:You can do this, as I usually do:http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/dGHFV/1362/Or, this:Or, use comments:Or, you can even skip certain closing tags entirely (all browsers are fine with this):Now that I\'ve gone and bored you to death with "one thousand different ways to remove whitespace, by thirtydot", hopefully you\'ve forgotten all about font-size: 0.Alternatively, you can now use flexbox to achieve many of the layouts that you may previously have used inline-block for: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/For CSS3 conforming browsers there is white-space-collapsing:discard see: http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-css3-text-20101005/#white-space-collapsingOk, although I\'ve upvoted both the font-size: 0; and the not implemented CSS3 feature answers, \nafter trying I found out that none of them is a real solution.Actually, there is not even one workaround without strong side effects.Then I decided to remove the spaces (this answers is about this argument) between the inline-block divs from my HTML source (JSP),\nturning this:to thisthat is ugly, but working.But, wait a minute... what if I\'m generating my divs inside Taglibs loops (Struts2, JSTL, etc...) ? For example:It is absolutely not thinkable to inline all that stuff, it would meanthat is not readable, hard to mantain and understand, etc...The solution i found: use HTML comments to connect the end of one div to the begin of the next one!This way you will have a readable and correctly indented code.And, as a positive side effect, the HTML source, although infested by empty comments, \nwill result correctly indented; let\'s take the first example, imho this:is better than thisHope that helps...Add comments between elements to NOT have a white space. For me it is easier than resetting font size to zero and then setting it back.This is the same answer I gave over on the related: Display: Inline block - What is that space?There\xe2\x80\x99s actually a really simple way to remove whitespace from inline-block that\xe2\x80\x99s both easy and semantic. It\xe2\x80\x99s called a custom font with zero-width spaces, which allows you to collapse the whitespace (added by the browser for inline elements when they\'re on separate lines) at the font level using a very tiny font. Once you declare the font, you just change the font-family on the container and back again on the children, and voila. Like this:Suit to taste. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a download to the font I just cooked up in font-forge and converted with FontSquirrel webfont generator. Took me all of 5 minutes. The css @font-face declaration is included: zipped zero-width space font. It\'s in Google Drive so you\'ll need to click File > Download to save it to your computer. You\'ll probably need to change the font paths as well if you copy the declaration to your main css file.All the space elimination techniques for display:inline-block are nasty hacks...  Use Flexbox It\'s awesome, solves all this inline-block layout bs, and as of 2017 has 98% browser support (more if you don\'t care about old IEs). Two more options based on CSS Text Module Level 3 (instead of white-space-collapsing:discard which had been dropped from the spec draft):In theory, should do exactly what is needed \xe2\x80\x94 shorten whitespaces\n    between \'words\' by the 100% of the space character width, i.e. to\n    zero. But seems not to work anywhere, unfortunately, and this\n    feature is marked \'at risk\' (it can be dropped from the spec, too).Shortens the inter-word spaces by the width of the digit \'0\'. In monospace font it should be exactly equal to the width of the space character (and any other character as well). This works in Firefox 10+, Chrome 27+, and almost works in IE9+FiddleUnfortunately, it is 2015 and white-space-collapse is still not implemented.In the meantime, give the parent element font-size: 0; and set the font-size on the children. This should do the trickWhy not use flexbox and do a fallback (from suggestions above) for older browsers. Add display: flex; to the parent element. Here os the soution with prefix font-size:0; can be a bit trickier to manage...I think the following couple lines is a lot better and more re-usable, and time saver than any other methods. I personally use this:Then you can use it as following...As far I as I know (I may be wrong) but all browsers support this method.EXPLANATION:This works (maybe -3px may be better) exactly as you would anticipate it to work.You will NOT have the need to go back to the css, and add another css rule, for your new inline blocks.Solving two issues at once.Also note the > (greater than sign) this means that */all children should be inline-block.http://jsfiddle.net/fD5u3/NOTE: I have modified to accommodate to inherit letter-spacing when a wrapper has a child wrapper.simple:no need to touch parent element.Only condition here: the item\'s font-size must not be defined (must be equal to parent\'s font-size).0.25em is the default word-spacingw3schools - word-spacing propertyYou can try the flexbox and apply the code below and the space will be remove.You can learn more about it on this link: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/I had this problem right now and from font-size:0; i\'ve found that in IE7 the problem remains because IE thinks "Font Size 0?!?! WTF are you crazy man?" - So, in my case i\'ve Eric Meyer\'s CSS reset and with font-size:0.01em; I have a difference of 1px from IE7 to FF9, so, I think this can be a solution.Generally we use elements like this in different lines but in case of display:inline-block using tags in same line will remove the space but in different line will notExample with tags in different lineExample with tags in same lineAnother efficient method will is a css job is using font-size:0 to parent element and give font-size to child element as much as u wantAbove methods may not work somewhere depending on the whole application but the last method is full proof solution for this situation and can be used anywhere.I\'m no pretty sure if you want to make two blue span without a gap or wanna handle others white-space, but if you wanna remove the gap,  and done.\nhope it helps you.I\xe2\x80\x99ve been tackling this recently and instead of setting the parent font-size:0 then setting the child back to a reasonable value, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting consistent results by setting the parent container letter-spacing:-.25em then the child back to letter-spacing:normal.In an alternate thread I saw a commenter mention that font-size:0 isn\xe2\x80\x99t always ideal because people can control minimum font sizes in their browsers, completely negating the possibility of setting the font-size to zero.Using ems appears to work regardless of whether the font-size specified is 100%, 15pt or 36px.http://cdpn.io/dKIjoI\'m going to expand on user5609829\'s answer a little bit as I believe the other solutions here are too complicated/too much work.  Applying a margin-right: -4px to the inline block elements will remove the spacing and is supported by all browsers.  See the updated fiddle here.  For those concerned with using negative margins, try giving this a read. I think there is a very simple/old method for this which is supported by all browsers even IE 6/7. We could simply set letter-spacing to a large negative value in parent and then set it back to normal at child elements:With php brackets.Thats all. \nIn other lang by analogyI found a pure css solution that worked for me very good in all browsers:Add  white-space: nowrap to the container element ; Html  : Here is the PlunkerRemove the spaces from Inline Block Elements there are many method:Negative margindiv a {\ndisplay: inline - block;\nmargin - right: -4 px;\n}font size to zeronav {\nfont - size: 0;\n}\nnav a {\nfont - size: 16 px;\n}Skip the closing tag< ul >\n    < li > one\n    < li > two \n    < li > three \n< /ul>The CSS Text Module Level 4 specification defines a text-space-collapse property, which allow to control the how white space inside and around an element is processed.So, regarding your example, you would just have to write this:Unfortunately, no browser is implementing this property yet (as of September 2016) as mentioned in the comments to the answer of HBP.One another way I found is applying margin-left as negative values except the first element of the row.There is a easy solution in css for example :HTMLCSS In my opinion write font-size:0 it is not safe when you use in project like em so I prefer purecss solution.\n  You can check this framework in this link purecss enjoy :)Regards :)I tried out the font-size: 0 solution to a similar problem in React JS and SASS for a Free Code Camp project I am currently working through. And it works!First, the script:Then, the SASS:Every question, that try to remove the space between inline-blocks seems like a <table> to me...Try something like this:
