I\'m trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I\'m wrong:Questions:Webpack and Browserify do pretty much the same job, which is bundling your modules to be used in a browser environment (though you can target other environments, like bundling your server-side ES6 code for Node). For example the Node module is a feature, which doesn\'t exist in the browser, and ES 6 modules are not implemented in any browser yet, which is why things need to be bundled. However, they differ in many ways, Webpack offers many tools by default (e.g. code splitting), while Browserify can do this only after downloading plugins, but using both leads to very similar results. It comes down to personal preference (I am used to Webpack). Webpack is not a task runner, it is just processor of your files (it processes them by so called loaders) run directly from CLI or by a task runner.webpack-dev-server provides something like Browsersync - a server, where you can deploy your app and verify your FE developing progress immediately by dev-server automatically refreshing the browser or even propagating changes without it with hot deploy (e.g. React components).I\'ve been using Gulp for its conciseness and easy task writing, but have later found out I need neither Gulp nor Grunt at all. Everything I have ever needed could have been done using npm scripts to run 3rd-party tools through their API. Choosing between Gulp, Grunt or npm scripts depends on your taste, JS experience and experience of developers working with you.While tasks in Gulp (or Grunt maybe) are easy to read even for people not so familiar with JS, it is yet another tool to require and learn, and I personally prefer to narrow my dependencies and make things simple. On the other hand, replacing these tasks with combination of npm scripts and run files (where configuration and execution function of tools like Webpack lies) is more challenging. But in the majority of cases, those three are equal in terms of results.As for the examples, I suggest you have a look at this React starter project, which shows you nice combination of npm scripts, Webpack and Browsersync. You can find those npm scripts in package.json in the root folder, in a property named scripts. There you will mostly encounter commands like babel-node tools/run start. Babel-node is a CLI tool (not ment for production use), which at first compiles ES6 file tools/run (run.js file located in tools) - basically a runner utility. This runner takes a function as an argument and runs it, which in this case is start - another utility (start.js) responsible for bundling source files (both client and server), starting node-express server and subsequently Browsersync, which serves as a proxy for propagating development changes to browser.Speaking more precisely, start.js imports Webpack config for client, manipulates it to add hot module replacement capabilities, then creates both client and server side bundles, starts node server through yet another utility named runServer.js and after successful start inits Browsersync, which looks something like this.The important part is proxy.target, where you set server address you want to proxy, which could be http://localhost:3000, and Browsersync starts a server listening on http://localhost:3001, where the same app is deployed, but with hot module replacement, so you can experience propagation of source file changes to browser immediately with or even without reloading. As you can see, there is another configuration property files with individual files or patterns Browsersync watches for changes and reloads browser, if some occur, but as the comment says, Webpack takes care of watching js sources by itself with HMR, so they cooperate there.Now I don\'t have any equivalent example of such Grunt or Gulp configuration, but with Gulp (and somewhat similarly with Grunt) you would write individual tasks in gulpfile.js likewhere you would be doing essentially pretty much the same things as in the starter-kit, this time with task runner, which solves some problems for you, but presents its own issues and some difficulties during learning the usage, and as I say, the more dependencies you have, the more can go wrong. And that is the reason I like to get rid of such tools.I\'ve been also searching for this quite some time since there is a lot of tools out there and each of them benefits us in a different aspect. The community is divided across tools like Browserify, Webpack, jspm, Grunt and Gulp. You might also hear about Yeoman or Slush. That\xe2\x80\x99s not really a problem, it\xe2\x80\x99s just confusing for everyone trying to understand a clear path forward.Anyway, I would like to contribute something.1. Package Manager Package managers simplify installing and updating project dependencies, which are libraries such as: jQuery, Bootstrap, etc - everything that is used on your site and isn\'t written by you.Browsing all the library websites, downloading and unpacking the archives, copying files into the projects \xe2\x80\x94 all of this is replaced with a few commands in the terminal.NPM stands for: Node JS package manager helps you to manage all the libraries your software relies on. You would define your needs in a file called package.json and run npm install in the command line... then BANG, your packages are downloaded and ready to use. Could be used both for front-end and back-end libraries.Bower: for front-end package management, the concept is same with NPM. All your libraries are stored in a file named bower.json and then run bower install in the command line. The biggest difference between Bower and NPM is that NPM does nested\n  dependency tree while Bower requires a flat dependency tree as below.Quoting from What is the difference between Bower and npm?NPMBowerThere are some updates on npm 3 Duplication and Deduplication,\n  please open the doc for more detail.Yarn: A new package manager for JavaScript published by Facebook recently with some more advantages compared to NPM. And with Yarn, you still can use both NPMand Bower registry to fetch the package. If you\'ve installed a package before, yarn creates a cached copy which facilitates offline package installs.jspm: is a package manager for the SystemJS universal module loader, built on top of the dynamic ES6 module loader. It is not an entirely new package manager with its own set of rules, rather it works on top of existing package sources. Out of the box, it works with GitHub and npm. As most of the Bower based packages are based on GitHub, we can install the those packages using jspm as well. It has a registry that lists most of the commonly used front-end packages for easier installation.See the different between Bower and jspm:\n  Package Manager: Bower vs jspm2. Module Loader/BundlingMost projects of any scale will have their code split between a number of files. You can just include each file with an individual <script> tag, however, <script> establishes a new http connection, and for small files \xe2\x80\x93 which is a goal of modularity \xe2\x80\x93 the time to set up the connection can take significantly longer than transferring the data. While the scripts are downloading, no content can be changed on the page.E.gE.gComputers can do that better than you can, and that is why you should use a tool to automatically bundle everything into a single file.Then we heard about RequireJS, Browserify, Webpack and SystemJSE.g: myModule.jsIn main.js, we can import myModule.js as dependency and use it.And then in our HTML, we can refer to use with RequireJS.Read more about CommonJS and AMD to get understanding easily.\n  Relation between CommonJS, AMD and RequireJS?Start with a build machine that has node & npm installed, and get the package:Write your modules in CommonJS formatAnd when happy, issue the command to bundle:Browserify recursively finds all dependencies of entry-point and assembles them into a single file:Basic usage is beyond simple. Install Webpack like Browserify:And pass the command an entry point and an output file:Want to know what is the node module and why it is not well adapted to in-browser.More useful article: Why jspm and SystemJS?One of the main goals of ES6 modularity is to make it really simple\n  to install and use any Javascript library from anywhere on the\n  Internet (Github, npm, etc.). Only two things are needed:So with jspm, you can do it.display.jsThen you configure these things within System.config({ ... }) before\n  importing your module. Normally when run jspm init, there will be a file \n  named config.js for this purpose.To make these scripts run, we need to load system.js and config.js on the HTML page. After that we will load the display.js file using\n  the SystemJS module loader. index.htmlNoted: You can also use npm with Webpack as Angular 2 has applied it. Since jspm was developed to integrate with SystemJS and it works on top of existing npm source, so your answer is up to you.3. Task runnerTask runners and build tools are primarily command-line tools. Why we need to use them: In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting which previously cost us a lot of times to do with command line or even manually.Every task in Grunt is an array of different plugin configurations, that simply get executed one after another, in a strictly independent, and sequential fashion.This is a Gulp sample task declaration.See more: https://medium.com/@preslavrachev/gulp-vs-grunt-why-one-why-the-other-f5d3b398edc4#.fte0nahri4. Scaffolding toolsFind more here. See more: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-NPM-Bower-Grunt-Gulp-Webpack-Browserify-Slush-Yeoman-and-ExpressMy answer is not really matched with the content of the question but when I\'m searching for these knowledge on Google, I always see the question on topso I decided to answer it in summary as well as why we need to use those tool. Recently I found a really comprehensive guide from Grab team about how to approach front-end development in 2017. You can check it out as below.https://github.com/grab/front-end-guideA small note about npm: npm3 tries install dependencies in a flat wayhttps://docs.npmjs.com/how-npm-works/npm3#npm-v3-dependency-resolutionYou can find some technical comparison on npmcompareComparing browserify vs. grunt vs. gulp vs. webpackAs you can see webpack is very well maintained with a new version coming out every 4 days on average.\nBut Gulp seems to have the biggest community of them all (with over 20K stars on Github)\nGrunt seems a bit neglected (compared to the others)So if need to choose one over the other i would go with GulpOK, they all have some similarities, they do the same thing for you in different and similar ways, I divide them in 3 main groups as below:\nwebpack and browserify as popular ones, work like task runners but with more flexibility, aslo it will bundle everything together as your setting, so you can point to the result as bundle.js for example in one single file including the CSS and Javascript, for more details of each, look at the details below:webpackwebpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When\n  webpack processes your application, it recursively builds a dependency\n  graph that includes every module your application needs, then packages\n  all of those modules into a small number of bundles - often only one -\n  to be loaded by the browser.It is incredibly configurable, but to get started you only need to\n  understand Four Core Concepts: entry, output, loaders, and plugins.This document is intended to give a high-level overview of these\n  concepts, while providing links to detailed concept specific\n  use-cases.more herebrowserifyBrowserify is a development tool that allows us to write node.js-style\n  modules that compile for use in the browser. Just like node, we write\n  our modules in separate files, exporting external methods and\n  properties using the module.exports and exports variables. We can even\n  require other modules using the require function, and if we omit the\n  relative path it\xe2\x80\x99ll resolve to the module in the node_modules\n  directory.more here2) Task runners gulp and grunt are task runners, basically what they do, creating tasks and run them whenever you want, for example you install a plugin to minify your CSS and then run it each time to do minifying, more details about each: gulpgulp.js is an open-source JavaScript toolkit by Fractal Innovations\n  and the open source community at GitHub, used as a streaming build\n  system in front-end web development. It is a task runner built on\n  Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm), used for automation of\n  time-consuming and repetitive tasks involved in web development like\n  minification, concatenation, cache busting, unit testing, linting,\n  optimization etc. gulp uses a code-over-configuration approach to\n  define its tasks and relies on its small, single-purposed plugins to\n  carry them out. gulp ecosystem has 1000+ such plugins made available\n  to choose from.more heregruntGrunt is a JavaScript task runner, a tool used to automatically\n  perform frequently used tasks such as minification, compilation, unit\n  testing, linting, etc. It uses a command-line interface to run custom\n  tasks defined in a file (known as a Gruntfile). Grunt was created by\n  Ben Alman and is written in Node.js. It is distributed via npm.\n  Presently, there are more than five thousand plugins available in the\n  Grunt ecosystem.more here3) Package managers package managers, what they do is managing plugins you need in your application and install them for you through github etc using package.json, very handy to update you modules, install them and sharing your app across, more details for each:npmnpm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It\n  is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment\n  Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an\n  online database of public packages, called the npm registry. The\n  registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be\n  browsed and searched via the npm website.more herebowerBower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts\n  or even image files. Bower doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concatenate or minify code or do\n  anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages\n  you need and their dependencies.\n  To get started, Bower works by fetching and installing packages from\n  all over, taking care of hunting, finding, downloading, and saving the\n  stuff you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for. Bower keeps track of these packages in a\n  manifest file, bower.json.more hereand the most recent package manager that shouldn\'t be missed, it\'s young and fast in real work environment compare to npm which I was mostly using before, for reinstalling modules, it do double checks the node_modules folder to check the existence of the module, also seems installing the modules takes less time:yarnYarn is a package manager for your code. It allows you to use and\n  share code with other developers from around the world. Yarn does this\n  quickly, securely, and reliably so you don\xe2\x80\x99t ever have to worry.Yarn allows you to use other developers\xe2\x80\x99 solutions to different\n  problems, making it easier for you to develop your software. If you\n  have problems, you can report issues or contribute back, and when the\n  problem is fixed, you can use Yarn to keep it all up to date.Code is shared through something called a package (sometimes referred\n  to as a module). A package contains all the code being shared as well\n  as a package.json file which describes the package.more hereWhat is webpack & webpack-dev-server? Official documentation says it\'s a module bundler but for me it\'s just a task runner. What\'s the difference?webpack-dev-server is a live reloading web server that Webpack developers use to get immediate feedback what they do. It should only be used during development.This project is heavily inspired by the nof5 unit test tool. Webpack as the name implies will create a SINGLE package for the web. The package will be minimized, and combined into a single file (we still live in HTTP 1.1 age). Webpack does the magic of combining the resources (JavaScript, CSS, images) and injecting them like this: <script src="assets/bundle.js"></script>.It can also be called module bundler because it must understand module dependencies, and how to grab the dependencies and to bundle them together.Where would you use browserify? Can\'t we do the same with node/ES6 imports?You could use Browserify on the exact same tasks where you would use Webpack. \xe2\x80\x93 Webpack is more compact, though.Note that the ES6 module loader features in Webpack2 are using System.import, which not a single browser supports natively.When would you use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins?You can forget Gulp, Grunt, Brokoli, Brunch and Bower. Directly use npm command line scripts instead and you can eliminate extra packages like these here for Gulp:You can probably use Gulp and Grunt config file generators when creating config files for your project. This way you don\'t need to install Yeoman or similar tools.Yarn is a recent package manager that probably deserves to be mentioned. So, there : https://yarnpkg.com/Afaik, it can fetch both npm and bower dependencies and has other appreciated features.StackShare provides a side-by-side (or stack up) of three tools at one time. Here it is for npm vs. Bower vs. Browserify and for gulp vs. Webpack vs. GruntOn these comparison pages you can find the following:Webpack is a bundler. Like Browserfy it looks in the codebase for module requests (require or import) and resolves them recursively. What is more, you can configure Webpack to resolve not just JavaScript-like modules, but CSS, images, HTML, literally everything. What especially makes me excited about Webpack, you can combine both compiled and dynamically loaded modules in the same app. Thus one get a real performance boost, especially over HTTP/1.x. How exactly you you do it I described with examples here http://dsheiko.com/weblog/state-of-javascript-modules-2017/\nAs an alternative for bundler one can think of Rollup.js (https://rollupjs.org/), which optimizes the code during compilation, but stripping all the found unused chunks. For AMD, instead of RequireJS one can go with native ES2016 module system, but loaded with System.js (https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)Besides, I would point that npm is often used as an automating tool like grunt or gulp. Check out https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts. I personally  go now with npm scripts only avoiding other automation tools, though in past I was very much into grunt. With other tools you have to rely on countless plugins for packages, that often are not good written and not being actively maintained. npm knows its packages, so you call to any of locally installed packages by name like:Actually you as a rule do not need any plugin if the package supports CLI.
