I want to know how to get the X and Y position of HTML elements such as img and div in JavaScript.The correct approach is to use element.getBoundingClientRect():Internet Explorer has supported this since as long as you are likely to care about and it was finally standardized in CSSOM Views.\xe2\x80\x82All other browsers adopted it a long time ago.Some browsers also return height and width properties, though this is non-standard.  If you\'re worried about older browser compatibility, check this answer\'s revisions for an optimised degrading implementation.The values returned by element.getBoundingClientRect() are relative to the viewport.  If you need it relative to another element, simply subtract one rectangle from the other:The libraries go to some lengths to get accurate offsets for an element.\nhere\'s a simple function that does the job in every circumstances that I\'ve tried.This worked for me (modified from highest voted answer):Using this we can callorIf page includes - at least- any "DIV", the function given by meouw throws the "Y" value beyond current page limits. In order to find the exact position, you need to handle both "offsetParent"s and "parentNode"s.Try the code given below (it is checked for FF2):You can add two properties to Element.prototype to get the top/left of any element.This is called like this:Here\'s a demo comparing the results to jQuery\'s offset().top and .left: http://jsfiddle.net/ThinkingStiff/3G7EZ/To retrieve the position relative to the page efficiently, and without using a recursive function: (includes IE also)HTML elements on most browsers will have:-These specifiy the position of the element relative its nearest parent that has layout.  This parent can often be accessed bif the offsetParent property.IE and FF3 haveThese properties are less common, they specify an elements position with its parents client area (padded area is part of the client area but border and margin is not).You might be better served by using a JavaScript framework, that has functions to return such information (and so much more!) in a browser-independant fashion. Here are a few:With these frameworks, you could do something like:\n$(\'id-of-img\').top\nto get the y-pixel coordinate of the image.jQuery .offset() will get the current coordinates of the first element, or set the coordinates of every element, in the set of matched elements, relative to the document.How about something like this, by passing ID of the element and it will return the left or top, we can combine them:1) find left2) find topor 3) find left and top togetherif using jQuery, the dimensions plugin is excellent and allows you specify exactly what you want.e.g.Relative position, absolute position, absolute position without padding, with padding...It goes on, let\'s just say there is a lot you can do with it.Plus the bonus of using jQuery is it\'s lightweight file size and easy use, you won\'t go back to JavaScript without it afterwards.I\'ve taken @meouw\'s answer, added in the clientLeft that allows for the border, and then created three versions:getAbsoluteOffsetFromBody - similar to @meouw\'s, this gets the absolute position relative to the body or html element of the document (depending on quirks mode)getAbsoluteOffsetFromGivenElement - returns the absolute position relative to the given element (relativeEl). Note that the given element must contain the element el, or this will behave the same as getAbsoluteOffsetFromBody. This is useful if you have two elements contained within another (known) element (optionally several nodes up the node tree) and want to make them the same position.getAbsoluteOffsetFromRelative - returns the absolute position relative to the first parent element with position: relative. This is similar to getAbsoluteOffsetFromGivenElement, for the same reason but will only go as far as the first matching element.If you are still having problems, particularly relating to scrolling, you could try looking at http://www.greywyvern.com/?post=331 - I noticed at least one piece of questionable code in getStyle which should be fine assuming browsers behave, but haven\'t tested the rest at all.This is the best code I\'ve managed to create (works in iframes as well, unlike jQuery\'s offset()). Seems webkit has a bit of a different behavior.Based on meouw\'s comment:If you are using jQuery, this could be a simple solution:The cleanest approach I have found is a simplified version of the technique used by jQuery\'s offset.  Similar to some of the other answers it starts with getBoundingClientRect; it then uses the window and the documentElement to adjust for scroll position as well as things like the margin on the body (often the default).  Difference between small and littleLook a example coordinates:\nhttp://javascript.info/tutorial/coordinatesI did it like this so it was cross-compatible with old browsers.More about coordinates in JavaScript here: http://javascript.info/tutorial/coordinatesI successfully used Andy E\'s solution to position a bootstrap 2 modal depending on what link in a table row a user clicks on. The page is a Tapestry 5 page and javascript below is imported in the java page class.javascript:}My modal code:The link in the loop:And the java code in the page class:Hope this helps someone, this post helped out.Just thought I\'d throw this out there as well. \nI haven\'t been able to test it in older browsers, but it works in the latest of the top 3.  :)After much research and testing this seems to worksee http://jsbin.com/xuvovalifo/edit?html,js,output Since different browsers are rendering border, padding, margin and etc in different way. I wrote a little function to retrieve top and left positions of specific element in every root element that you want in precise dimension: For retrieve left position you must return:
