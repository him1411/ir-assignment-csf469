I know how to make a new branch that tracks remote branches, but how do I make an existing branch track a remote branch?I know I can just edit the .git/config file, but it seems there should be an easier way.Given a branch foo and a remote upstream:As of Git 1.8.0:Or, if local branch foo is not the current branch:Or, if you like to type longer commands, these are equivalent to the above two:As of Git 1.7.0:Notes:All of the above commands will cause local branch foo to track remote branch foo from remote upstream.  The old (1.7.x) syntax is deprecated in favor of the new (1.8+) syntax.  The new syntax is intended to be more intuitive and easier to remember.See also: Why do I need to do `--set-upstream` all the time?You can do the following (assuming you are checked out on master and want to push to a remote branch master):Set up the \'remote\' if you don\'t have it alreadyNow configure master to know to track:And push:I do this as a side-effect of pushing with the -u option as inThe equivalent long option is --set-upstream.The git-branch command also understands --set-upstream, but its use can be confusing. Version 1.8.0 modifies the interface.git branch --set-upstream is deprecated and may be removed in a relatively distant future.  git branch [-u|--set-upstream-to] has been introduced with a saner order of arguments.â€¦It was tempting to say git branch --set-upstream origin/master, but that tells Git to arrange the local branch "origin/master" to integrate with the currently checked out branch, which is highly unlikely what the user meant. The option is deprecated; use the new --set-upstream-to (with a short-and-sweet -u) option instead.Say you have a local foo branch and want it to treat the branch by the same name as its upstream. Make this happen withor justYou might find the git_remote_branch tool useful. It offers simple commands for creating, publishing, deleting, tracking & renaming remote branches. One nice feature is that you can ask a grb command to explain what git commands it would execute.Actually for the accepted answer to work:I believe that in as early as Git 1.5.x you could make a local branch $BRANCH track a remote branch origin/$BRANCH, like this.Given that $BRANCH and origin/$BRANCH exist, and you\'ve not currently checked out $BRANCH (switch away if you have), do:This recreates $BRANCH as a tracking branch. The -f forces the creation despite $BRANCH existing already. --track is optional if the usual defaults are in place (that is, the git-config parameter branch.autosetupmerge is true).Note, if origin/$BRANCH doesn\'t exist yet, you can create it by pushing your local $BRANCH into the remote repository with:Followed by the previous command to promote the local branch into a tracking branch.Make sure you run : to be able to push trouble free Editing .git/config is probably the easiest and fastest way. That\'s what the Git commands for handling remote branches are doing, anyway.If you don\'t want to muck with the file by hand (and it\'s not that hard to do), you can always use git config to do it...but again, that\'s just going to edit the .git/config file, anyway.There are, of course, ways to automatically track a remote branch when using git checkout (by passing the --track flag, for example), but these commands work with new branches, not existing ones.1- update your local meta-data using  : git fetch --all2- show your remote and local branches using : git branch -a\n, see the following Screenshot3- switch to target branch , that you want to linked with the remote: usinggit checkout branchNameexample :  4- Link your local branch to a remote branch using: git branch --set-upstream-to  nameOfRemoteBranchN.B  : nameOfRemoteBranch : to copy from the output of step 2 " git branch -r "Example of use: In very shortThis will make your yourLocalBranchName track the remote branch called develop.For 1.6.x, it can be done using the git_remote_branch tool:That will cause Git to make foo track upstream/foo.Here, using github and git version 2.1.4, just do:And remotes come by itelsef, even if not linked locally:But of course, still no local branch:See? Now if you just checkout develp, it will do the magic automatically:So easy!Summary. Just run this 2 commands:In a somewhat related way I was trying to add a remote tracking branch to an existing branch, but did not have access to that remote repository on the system where I wanted to add that remote tracking branch on (because I frequently export a copy of this repo via sneakernet to another system that has the access to push to that remote). I found that there was no way to force adding a remote branch on the local that hadn\'t been fetched yet (so local did not know that the branch existed on the remote and I would get the error: the requested upstream branch \'origin/remotebranchname\' does not exist). In the end I managed to add the new, previously unknown remote branch (without fetching) by adding a new head file at .git/refs/remotes/origin/remotebranchname and then copying the ref (eyeballing was quickest, lame as it was ;-) from the system with access to the origin repo to the workstation (with the local repo where I was adding the remote branch on).Once that was done, I could then use git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/remotebranchnameI use the following command (Suppose yout branch name is "branch-name"):After a git pull :git checkout --track <remote-branch-name>Or:git fetch && git checkout <branch-name>This isn\'t a direct answer to this question, but I wanted to leave a note here for anyone who may be having the same issue as me when trying to configure an upstream branch.Be wary of push.default. With older git versions, the default was matching, which would cause very undesirable behaviour if you have, for example:Local branch "master" tracking to origin/masterRemote branch "upstream" tracking to upstream/masterIf you tried to "git push" when on the "upstream" branch, with push.default matching git would automatically try to merge the local branch "master" into "upstream/master", causing a whole lot of chaos.This gives more sane behaviour:git config --global push.default upstreamFor creating new branch, we could use following command \n  This would work tooor simply by  : switch to the branch if you are not in it already:run and you ready to :You can alawys take a look at the config file to see what is tracking what by running:
