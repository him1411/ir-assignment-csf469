I have been reading online and some places say it isn\'t possible, some say it is and then give an example and others refute the example, etc. How do I declare a 2 dimensional array in JavaScript? (assuming it\'s possible) How would I access its members? (myArray[0][1] or myArray[0,1]?)You simply make each item within the array an array.Similar to activa\'s answer, here\'s a function to create an n-dimensional array:Javascript only has 1-dimensional arrays, but you can build arrays of arrays, as others pointed out.The following function can be used to construct a 2-d array of fixed dimensions:The number of columns is not really important, because it is not required to specify the size of an array before using it.Then you can just call:The easiest way:The reason some say that it isn\'t possible is because a two dimensional array is really just an array of arrays. The other comments here provide perfectly valid methods of creating two dimensional arrays in JavaScript, but the purest point of view would be that you have a one dimensional array of objects, each of those objects would be a one dimensional array consisting of two elements.So, that\'s the cause of the conflicting view points. Few people show the use of push:\nTo bring something new, I will show you how to initialize the matrix with some value, example: 0 or an empty string "".\nReminding that if you have a 10 elements array, in javascript the last index will be 9!usage examples: Two-liner:It will generate an array a of the length 10, filled with arrays.\n(Push adds an element to an array and returns the new length)This is what i achieved :This spelled me bineeshkumar The sanest answer seems to beCan\'t directly fill with the rows since fill uses shallow copy constructor, therefore all rows would share the same memory...Two dimensional arrays are created the same way single dimensional arrays are.  And you access them like array[0][1].I\'m not sure if anyone has answered this but I found this worked for me pretty well - eg: For a 2 dimensional array, for instance. The easiest way:To create a 2D array in javaScript we can create an Array first and then add Arrays as it\'s elements. This method will return a 2D array with the given number of rows and columns.     to create an Array use this method as below.In JavaScript 1.7 and higher you can use array comprehensions to create two dimensional arrays. You can also filter and/or manipulate the entries while filling the array and don\'t have to use loops.You can create any n x m array you want and fill it with a default value by callingMore examples and documentation can be found here.Please note that this is not a standard feature yet.I found below is the simplest way:I had to make a flexible array function to add "records" to it as i needed and to be able to update them and do whatever calculations e needed before i sent it to a database for further processing. Here\'s the code, hope it helps :).Feel free to optimize and / or point out any bugs :)Javascript does not support two dimensional arrays, instead we store an array inside another array and fetch the data from that array depending on what position of that array you want to access. Remember array numeration starts at ZERO.Code Example:Here\'s a quick way I\'ve found to make a two dimensional array.You can easily turn this function into an ES5 function as well.Why this works: the new Array(n) constructor creates an object with a prototype of Array.prototype and then assigns the object\'s length, resulting in an unpopulated array. Due to its lack of actual members we can\'t run the Array.prototype.map function on it.However, when you provide more than one argument to the constructor, such as when you do Array(1, 2, 3, 4), the constructor will use the arguments object to instantiate and populate an Array object correctly.For this reason, we can use Array.apply(null, Array(x)), because the apply function will spread the arguments into the constructor. For clarification, doing Array.apply(null, Array(3)) is equivalent to doing Array(null, null, null).Now that we\'ve created an actual populated array, all we need to do is call map and create the second layer (y).var md = [];\nfor(var i=0; i<5; i++) {\n    md.push(new Array(5).fill(null));\n}Creates a 5x5 matrix and fill them with nullYou could allocate an array of rows, where each row is an array of the same length. Or you could allocate a one-dimensional array with rows*columns elements and define methods to map row/column coordinates to element indices.Whichever implementation you pick, if you wrap it in an object you can define the accessor methods in a prototype to make the API easy to use. I found that this code works for me:...A simplified example:My approach is very similar to @Bineesh answer but with a more general approach.You can declare the double array as follows:And the storing and accessing the contents in the following manner:This will print the expected outputFor one liner lovers Array.from()Another one (from comment by dmitry_romanov) use Array().fill()I\'ve made a modification of Matthew Crumley\'s answer for creating a multidimensional array function. I\'ve added the dimensions of the array to be passed as array variable and there will be another variable - value, which will be used to set the values of the elements of the last arrays in the multidimensional array.Recursive function to create a multi-dimensional array:Build a 2x3x4x2 4D-Array:You can also create a function to create a 2D array like this:You can call it by using the following, which will give you a 10x10 2D array.You also can create a 3D array using this method.One liner to create a m*n 2 dimensional array filled with 0.If you are after 2D array for google charts, the best way to do it is referring to \nNot a valid 2d array google chart
