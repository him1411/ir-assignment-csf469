Is there a plugin-less way of retrieving query string values via jQuery (or without)? If so, how? If not, is there a plugin which can do so?You don\'t need jQuery for that purpose. You can use just some pure JavaScript:Usage:\nNote: If a parameter is present several times (?foo=lorem&foo=ipsum), you will get the first value (lorem). There is no standard about this and usages vary, see for example this question: Authoritative position of duplicate HTTP GET query keys.This is an update based on the new URLSearchParams specs to achieve the same with just two lines of code:Some of the solutions posted here are inefficient. Repeating the regular expression search every time the script needs to access a parameter is completely unnecessary, one single function to split up the parameters into an associative-array style object is enough. If you\'re not working with the HTML 5 History API, this is only necessary once per page load.  The other suggestions here also fail to decode the URL correctly.Example querystring: ?i=main&mode=front&sid=de8d49b78a85a322c4155015fdce22c4&enc=+Hello%20&emptyResult:This could easily be improved upon to handle array-style query strings too.  An example of this is here, but since array-style parameters aren\'t defined in RFC 3986 I won\'t pollute this answer with the source code. For those interested in a "polluted" version, look at campbeln\'s answer below.Also, as pointed out in the comments, ; is a legal delimiter for key=value pairs.  It would require a more complicated regex to handle ; or &, which I think is unnecessary because it\'s rare that ; is used and I would say even more unlikely that both would be used.  If you need to support ; instead of &, just swap them in the regex.Much simpler!With an URL like ?topic=123&name=query+string, the following will return:Tearing Google\'s code I found the method they use: getUrlParametersIt is obfuscated, but it is understandable.They start to look for parameters on the url from ? and also from the hash #. Then for each parameter they split in the equal sign b[f][p]("=") (which looks like indexOf, they use the position of the char to get the key/value). Having it split they check whether the parameter has a value or not, if it has they store the value of d, if not it just continue.In the end the object d is returned, handling escaping and the + sign. This object is just like mine, it has the same behavior.My method as a jQuery pluginUsagePreparation code: methods declarationTesting in Firefox 4.0 x86 on Windows Server 2008 R2 / 7 x64Improved version of Artem Barger\'s answer:For more information on improvement see: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/bujs-1-getparameterbyname/Just another recommendation. The plugin Purl allows to retrieve all parts of URL, including anchor, host, etc.It can be used with or without jQuery.Usage is very simple and cool:However, as of Nov 11, 2014, Purl is no longer maintained and the author recommends using URI.js instead.  The jQuery plugin is different in that it focuses on elements - for usage with strings, just use URI directly, with or without jQuery.  Similar code would look as such, fuller docs here:Firefox 44+, Opera 36+ and Chrome 49+ support the URLSearchParams API:Safari Nightly has implemented it, and it is in development for Microsoft Edge as well. There is a google-suggested URLSearchParams polyfill for the stable versions of Safari, Edge, and IE.It is not standardized by W3C, but it is a living standard by WhatWG.You can use it on location, but you need to remove the ? question mark (for example, with .slice(1)):orOr of course on any URL:You can get params also using a shorthand .searchParams property on the URL object, like this:You read/set parameters through the get(KEY), set(KEY, VALUE), append(KEY, VALUE) API. You can also iterate over all values for (let p of params) {}.A reference implementation and a sample page are available for auditing and testing.Roshambo on snipplr.com has a simple script to achieve this described in Get URL Parameters with jQuery | Improved. With his script you also easily get to pull out just the parameters you want.Here\'s the gist:Then just get your parameters from the query string.So if the URL/query string was xyz.com/index.html?lang=de.Just call var langval = $.urlParam(\'lang\');, and you\'ve got it.UZBEKJON has a great blog post on this as well, Get URL parameters & values with jQuery.A quick, complete solution, which handles multivalued keys and encoded characters.What is all this code...\n"null-coalescing", short-circuit evaluation\nES6 Destructuring assignments, Arrow functions, Template stringsTo access different parts of a URL use location.(search|hash)Simple key check (item in dict) ? dict.item.push(val) : dict.item = [val]Use decodeURIComponent() for the second or both splits.\n*!!! Please note, that decodeURIComponent(undefined) returns string "undefined". The solution lies in a simple usage of &&, which ensures that decodeURIComponent() is not called on undefined values. (See the "complete solution" at the top.)\nIf the querystring is empty (location.search == ""), the result is somewhat misleading qd == {"": undefined}. It is suggested to check the querystring before launching the parsing function likeso:If you\'re using jQuery, you can use a library, such as jQuery BBQ: Back Button & Query Library....jQuery BBQ provides a full .deparam() method, along with both hash state management, and fragment / query string parse and merge utility methods.Edit: Adding Deparam Example:If you want to just use plain JavaScript, you could use...Because of the new HTML History API and specifically history.pushState() and history.replaceState(), the URL can change which will invalidate the cache of parameters and their values.This version will update its internal cache of parameters each time the history changes.Here\'s my stab at making Andy E\'s excellent solution into a full fledged jQuery plugin:The syntax is:Best of both worlds!Just use two splits:I was reading all the previous and more complete answers. But I think that is the simplest and faster method. You can check in this jsPerf benchmarkTo solve the problem in Rup\'s comment, add a conditional split by changing the first line to the two below. But absolute accuracy means it\'s now slower than regexp (see jsPerf).So if you know you won\'t run into Rup\'s counter-case, this wins. Otherwise, regexp.If you\'re doing more URL manipulation than simply parsing the querystring, you may find URI.js helpful. It is a library for manipulating URLs - and comes with all the bells and whistles. (Sorry for self-advertising here)to convert your querystring into a map:(URI.js also "fixes" bad querystrings like ?&foo&&bar=baz& to ?foo&bar=baz)I like Ryan Phelan\'s solution. But I don\'t see any point of extending jQuery for that? There is no usage of jQuery functionality.On other hand I like the built-in function in Google Chrome: window.location.getParameter.So why not to use this? Okay, other browsers don\'t have. So let\'s create this function if it does not exist:This function is more or less from Ryan Phelan, but it is wrapped differently: clear name and no dependencies of other javascript libraries. More about this function on my blog.Here is a fast way to get an object similar to the PHP $_GET array:Usage:For the query string x=5&y&z=hello&x=6 this returns the object:Keep it simple in plain JavaScript code:Call it from anywhere in the JavaScript code:These are all great answers, but I needed something a bit more robust, and thought you all might like to have what I created.It is a simple library method that does dissection and manipulation of URL parameters. The static method has the following sub methods that can be called on the subject URL:Example:From the MDN:I use regular expressions a lot, but not for that.It seems easier and more efficient to me to read the query string once in my application, and build an object from all the key/value pairs like:For a URL like http://domain.com?param1=val1&param2=val2 you can get their value later in your code as search.param1 and search.param2.Code golf:Display it!On my Mac: test.htm?i=can&has=cheezburger displaysRoshambo jQuery method wasn\'t taking care of decode URLhttp://snipplr.com/view/26662/get-url-parameters-with-jquery--improved/Just added that capability also while adding in  the return statement Now you can find the updated gist:I like this one (taken from jquery-howto.blogspot.co.uk):Works great for me.Here\'s my edit to this excellent answer - with added ability to parse query strings with keys without values.IMPORTANT! The parameter for that function in the last line is different. It\'s just an example of how one can pass an arbitrary URL to it. You can use last line from Bruno\'s answer to parse the current URL.So what exactly changed? With url http://sb.com/reg/step1?param= results will be same. But with url http://sb.com/reg/step1?param Bruno\'s solution returns an object without keys, while mine returns an object with key param and undefined value.I needed an object from the query string, and I hate lots of code. It may not be the most robust in the universe, but it\'s just a few lines of code.A URL like this.htm?hello=world&foo=bar will create:This is a function I created a while back and I\'m quite happy with. It is not case sensitive - which is handy. Also, if the requested QS doesn\'t exist, it just returns an empty string.I use a compressed version of this. I\'m posting uncompressed for the novice types to better explain what\'s going on.I\'m sure this could be optimized or done differently to work faster, but it\'s always worked great for what I need.Enjoy.We\'ve just released arg.js, a project aimed at solving this problem once and for all.  It\'s traditionally been so difficult but now you can do:or getting the whole lot:and if you care about the difference between ?query=true and #hash=true then you can use the Arg.query() and Arg.hash() methods.The problem with the top answer on that question is that it\'s not-supported parameters placed after #, but sometimes it\'s needed to get this value also.I modified the answer to let it parse a full query string with a hash sign also:Here\'s an extended version of Andy E\'s linked "Handle array-style query strings"-version. Fixed a bug (?key=1&key[]=2&key[]=3; 1 is lost and replaced with [2,3]), made a few minor performance improvements (re-decoding of values, recalculating "[" position, etc.) and added a number of improvements (functionalized, support for ?key=1&key=2, support for ; delimiters). I left the variables annoyingly short, but added comments galore to make them readable (oh, and I reused v within the local functions, sorry if that is confusing ;).It will handle the following querystring...?test=Hello&person=neek&person[]=jeff&person[]=jim&person[extra]=john&test3&nocache=1398914891264...making it into an object that looks like...As you can see above, this version handles some measure of "malformed" arrays, i.e. - person=neek&person[]=jeff&person[]=jim or person=neek&person=jeff&person=jim as the key is identifiable and valid (at least in dotNet\'s NameValueCollection.Add):If the specified key already exists in the target NameValueCollection\n  instance, the specified value is added to the existing comma-separated\n  list of values in the form "value1,value2,value3".It seems the jury is somewhat out on repeated keys as there is no spec. In this case, multiple keys are stored as an (fake)array. But do note that I do not process values based on commas into arrays.The code:And this is how you can use this function assuming the URL ishttp://dummy.com/?stringtext=jquery&stringword=jquerybyexampleI developed a small library using techniques listed here to create an easy to use, drop-in solution to anyones troubles; It can be found here: https://github.com/Nijikokun/query-jsUsageFetching specific parameter/key:Using the builder to fetch the entire object:and tons more... check the github link for more examples.Features
