In PHP:There are require and include_once as well.So your question should be... The answer to 1 is described here.The require() function is identical to include(), except that it handles errors differently. If an error occurs, the include() function generates a warning, but the script will continue execution. The require() generates a fatal error, and the script will stop.The answer to 2 can be found here.The require_once() statement is identical to require() except PHP will check if the file has already been included, and if so, not include (require) it again.Userequire\nwhen the file is required by your application, e.g. an important message template or a file containing configuration variables without which the app would break.require_once\nwhen the file contains content that would produce an error on subsequent inclusion, e.g. \nfunction important() { /* important code */} is definitely needed in your application but since functions cannot be redeclared should not be included again.include\nwhen the file is not required and application flow should continue when not found, e.g.\ngreat for templates referencing variables from the current scope or somethinginclude_once\noptional dependencies that would produce errors on subsequent loading or maybe remote file inclusion that you do not want to happen twice due to the HTTP overheadBut basically, it\'s up to you when to use which.My suggestion is to just use require_once 99.9% of the time.Using require or include instead implies that your code is not reusable elsewhere, i.e. that the scripts you\'re pulling in actually execute code instead of making available a class or some function libraries.  If you are require/including code that executes on the spot, that\'s procedural code, and you need to get to know a new paradigm.  Like object oriented programming, function-based programming, or functional programming.If you\'re already doing OO or functional programming, using include_once is mostly going to be delaying where in the stack you find bugs/errors.  Do you want to know that the function do_cool_stuff() is not available when you go to call for it later, or the moment that you expect it to be available by requiring the library?  Generally, it\'s best to know immediately if something you need and expect isn\'t available, so just use require_once.Alternatively, in modern OOP, just autoload your classes upon use.Difference between _once functions and without _once functions:\nwithout _once code will be included again whereas with _once functions PHP keeps track of the included files and will include it only once.Difference between require and include:\nIf a required file is not found PHP will emit a fatal error whereas for include only a warning will be emitted.include() will throw a warning if it can\'t include the file, but the rest of the script will run.require() will throw an E_COMPILE_ERROR and halt the script if it can\'t include the file.The include_once() and require_once() functions will not include the file a second time if it has already been included.See the following documentation pages:Whenever you are using require_once() can be use in a file to include another file when you need the called file only a single time in the current file. \nHere in the example I have an test1.php.and in another file that I have named test2.phpas you are watching the m requiring the the test1 file twice but the file will include the test1 once and for calling at the second time this will be ignored.  And without halting will display the output a single time.Whenever you are using \'include_once()` can be used in a file to include another file when you need the called file more than once in the current file. \nHere in the example I have a file named test3.php.And in another file that I have named test4.phpas you are watching the m including the test3 file will include the file a single time but halt the further execution.Use "include" for reusable PHP templates. Use "require" for required libraries."*_once" is nice, because it checks whether the file is already loaded or not, but it only makes sense for me in "require_once".The difference is in the error the commands generate. With require, the file you want to use is really required and thus generates an E_ERROR if it is not found. require() is identical to include()  except upon failure it will also produce a fatal E_ERROR  level error.include only generates an E_WARNING error if it fails which is more or less silent.So use it if the file is required to make the remaining code work and you want the script to fail the file is not available.For *_once():include_once() may be used in cases where the same file might be included and evaluated more than once during a particular execution of a script, so in this case it may help avoid problems such as function redefinitions, variable value reassignments, etc.Same applies to require_once() of course.Reference: require(), include_once()With require the file must exist, if it doesn\'t then an error will display; whereas with include - if the file doesn\'t exist then then the page will continue loading.Require critical parts, like authorization and include all others.Multiple includes are just very bad design and must be avoided at all. So, *_once doesn\'t really matter.Include / Require you can include the same file more than once also:require() is identical to include() except upon failure it will also produce a fatal E_COMPILE_ERROR level error. In other words, it will halt the script whereas include() only emits a warning (E_WARNING) which allows the script to continue.require_once / include_onceis identical to include/require except PHP will check if the file has already been included, and if so, not include (require) it again.You should keep class and function definitions organized in files.Use require_once to load dependencies (classes, functions, constants).Use require to load template-like files.include()It includes a specified file.\nIt will produce a warning if it fail to find the file and execute the remaining scriptsrequire()It includes a specified file.\nIt will produce a fatal error if it fail to find the file and stops the executioninclude_once()It includes a specified file.\na file has already been included, it will not be included again.\nIt will produce a a warning if it fail to find the file and execute the remaining scripts.require_once()It includes a specified file.\na file has already been included, it will not be included again.\nIt will produce a a fatal error if it fail to find the file and stops the execution.From the manual:require() is identical to include() except upon failure it will also produce a fatal E_COMPILE_ERROR level error. In other words, it will halt the script whereas include() only emits a warning (E_WARNING) which allows the script to continue.The same is true for the _once() variants.include() will generate a warning when it doesn\'t find a file, but require_once() will generate a fatal error.Another thing is if file is included before. Then require_once() will not include it again.I was using function as below :There were constant values declared in xyz.php.I have to call this doSomething() function from other php script file.But I observed behavior while calling this function in a loop, for first iteration doSomething() was getting constant values within xyz.php, but later every iteration doSomething() was not able to get the constant values declared in xyz.php.I solved my problem by switching from require_once() to include(), updated doSomething() code is as below :Now every iteration call to doSomething() gets the constant values defined in xyz.php.require will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script.include will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continuerequire_once statement can be used to include a php file in another one, when you may need to include the called file more than once. If a.php is a php script calling b.php with require_once() statement, and does not find b.php, a.php stops executes causing a fatal error.Use require function when you need to load any class, function, or dependency.Use include function when you want to load template-styled fileIf you are still confused, just use require_once for all time.Require and include functions does the same task i.e. includes and evaluates specified file, but the difference is require will cause a fatal error when the specified file location is invalid or for any error where as include will generate a warning and continue the code execution.so you may use require function in the case where the file you are trying to include is the heart of the system and may cause a huge impact on rest of the code and you can use include function when the file you are trying to include is a simple file containing some less important code.And my personal recommendation(for less important code) is to go for require function everywhere in your code while it is in development phase such that you can debug code and later on replace all require functions by include function before moving it to production such that if you miss any bugs it will not affect end user and rest of code executes properly...The basic difference between require and require_once is require_once will check whether the file is already included or not if it is already included then it won\'t include the file where as require function will include the file irrespective of whether file is already included or notso in cases where you want to include some piece of code again and again use require function where as if you want to include some code only once in your code use require_once In the age of PSR-0 / PSR-4 autoloaders it may be completely unnecessary to use any of the statements if all you need is to make some functions / classes available to your code (of course you still need to require_once autoloader itself in your bootstrap file and include templates if you still use PHP as a template engine). require has greater overhead than include, since it has to parse the file first. Replacing requires with includes is often a good optimization technique.Basically, if you require a wrong path,  php throws a fatal error and the shutdown function is called, but when you include a wrong path, php will continue execution but will just display a warning that the file does not exist .From the English word require, php is told that the execution of the page or file depends on the file required.From my experience, it\'s norm to require important files such as configuration files,  database classes and other important utilities just using require and include. \ncause think how to work include_once or require_once\nthat is looking for log data which save included or required php files.\nso, that is slower than include n require.just using like this..
