If I make changes to .bashrc, how do I reload it without logging out and back in?You just have to enter the command:or you can use the shorter version of the command:or you could use;does the same thing.

Since special variable $BASH always contains the full path of the executable that started the current shell, exec "$BASH" is guaranteed to use the same executable.. .bashrc...Depending on your environment, just typingmay also work.With this, you won\'t even have to type "source ~/.bashrc":Include your bashrc file:Every time you want to edit your bashrc, just run the alias "rc". is a BASH shortcut for the "source" builtin command. \xe2\x80\x93 Brian Showaltertype: i use the following command on msysgit shorter version of This will also work..
