How can I refresh a page with jQuery?Use location.reload():The reload() function takes an optional parameter that can be set to true to force a reload from the server rather than the cache. The parameter defaults to false, so by default the page may reload from the browser\'s cache.This should work on all browsers even without jQuery:There are multiple unlimited ways to refresh a page with JavaScript:location.reload(false) If we needed to pull the document from\n   the web-server again (such as where the document contents\n   change dynamically) we would pass the argument as true.You can continue the list being creative:Lots of ways will work, I suppose:To reload a page with jQuery, do:The approach here that I used was Ajax jQuery. I tested it on Chrome 13. Then I put the code in the handler that will trigger the reload. The URL is "", which means this page.If the current page was loaded by a POST request, you may want to useinstead ofbecause window.location.reload() will prompt for confirmation if called on a page that was loaded by a POST request.The question should be,How to refresh a page with JavaScriptYou\'re spoiled for choice.You may want to useforceGet is a boolean and optional.The default is false which reloads the page from the cache.Set this parameter to true if you want to force the browser to get the page from the server to get rid of the cache as well.Or justif you want quick and easy with caching.Three approaches with different cache-related behaviours:In browsers that implement the forcedReload parameter of location.reload(), reloads by fetching a fresh copy of the page and all of its resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.). Will not serve any resources from the cache - gets fresh copies from the server without sending any if-modified-since or if-none-match headers in the request.Equivalent to the user doing a "hard reload" in browsers where that\'s possible.Note that passing true to location.reload() is supported in Firefox (see MDN) and Internet Explorer (see MSDN) but is not supported universally and is not part of the W3 HTML 5 spec, nor the W3 draft HTML 5.1 spec, nor the WHATWG HTML Living Standard.In unsupporting browsers, like Google Chrome, location.reload(true) behaves the same as location.reload().Reloads the page, fetching a fresh, non-cached copy of the page HTML itself, and performing RFC 7234 revalidation requests for any resources (like scripts) that the browser has cached, even if they are fresh are RFC 7234 permits the browser to serve them without revalidation.Exactly how the browser should utilise its cache when performing a location.reload() call isn\'t specified or documented as far as I can tell; I determined the behaviour above by experimentation.This is equivalent to the user simply pressing the "refresh" button in their browser.Only works if the page\'s URL doesn\'t contain a fragid/hashbang!Reloads the page without refetching or revalidating any fresh resources from the cache. If the page\'s HTML itself is fresh, this will reload the page without performing any HTTP requests at all.This is equivalent (from a caching perspective) to the user opening the page in a new tab.However, if the page\'s URL contains a hash, this will have no effect.Again, the caching behaviour here is unspecified as far as I know; I determined it by testing.So, in summary, you want to use:You can perform this task without using jQuery by window.location.reload();. As there are many ways to do this but I think it is the appropriate way to reload the same docuemnt with javascript. Here is the explainationJavascript window.location object can be used window -- The window object in java-script represents an open window in a browser. location -- The location object in java script holds information about the current URL.The location object is like a fragment of the window object and is called up through the window.location property.Location Objects has three methods -- So here we need to use reload() because it can help us in reloading  the same document.So use it like window.location.reload();Online Demo jsfiddleTo ask your browser to retrieve the page directly from the server not from the cache, you can pass a true parameter to location.reload(): window.location.reload() will reload from the server and will load all your data, scripts, images, etc. again.So if you just want to refresh the HTML, the window.location = document.URL will return much quicker and with less traffic. But it will not reload the page if there is a hash (#) in the URL.The jQuery Load function can also perform a page refresh:Here is a solution that asynchronously reloads a page using jQuery. It avoids the flicker caused by window.location = window.location. This example shows a page that reloads continuously, as in a dashboard. It is battle-tested and is running on an information display TV in Times Square.Notes:As the question is generic, let\'s try to sum up possible solutions for the answer:Simple plain JavaScript Solution:The easiest way is a one line solution placed in an appropriate way:What many people are missing here, because they hope to get some "points" is that the reload() function itself offers a Boolean as a parameter (details: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/reload).The Location.reload() method reloads the resource from the current\n  URL. Its optional unique parameter is a Boolean, which, when it is\n  true, causes the page to always be reloaded from the server. If it is\n  false or not specified, the browser may reload the page from its\n  cache.This means there are two ways:Solution1: Force reloading the current page from the serverSolution2: Reloading from cache or server (based on browser and your config)And if you want to combine it with jQuery an listening to an event, I would recommend using the ".on()" method instead of ".click" or other event wrappers, e.g. a more proper solution would be:I foundoralso makes a page refresh.This makes it very much easier to reload the page removing any hash.\nThis is very nice when I am using AngularJS in the iOS simulator, so that I don\'t have to rerun the app.
