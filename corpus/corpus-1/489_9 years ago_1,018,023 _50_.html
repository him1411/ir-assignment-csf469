I\'m trying to direct a browser to a different page. If I wanted a GET request, I might sayBut the resource I\'m trying to access won\'t respond properly unless I use a POST request. If this were not dynamically generated, I might use the HTMLThen I would just submit the form from the DOM.But really I would like JavaScript code that allows me to sayWhat\'s the best cross browser implementation?Edit I\'m sorry I was not clear. I need a solution that changes the location of the browser, just like submitting a form. If this is possible with XMLHttpRequest, it is not obvious. And this should not be asynchronous, nor use XML, so Ajax is not the answer.Example:EDIT: Since this has gotten upvoted so much, I\'m guessing people will be copy-pasting this a lot. So I added the hasOwnProperty check to fix any inadvertent bugs.This would be a version of the selected answer using jQuery.A simple quick-and-dirty implementation of @Aaron answer:Of course, you should rather use a JavaScript framework such as Prototype or jQuery...Using the createElement function provided in this answer, which is necessary due to IE\'s brokenness with the name attribute on elements created normally with document.createElement:Rakesh Pai\'s answer is amazing, but there is an issue that occurs for me (in Safari) when you try to post a form with a field called submit. For example, post_to_url("http://google.com/",{ submit: "submit" } );. I have patched the function slightly to walk around this variable space collision.If you have Prototype installed, you can tighten up the code to generate and submit the hidden form like this:No, you cant have the JavaScript post request like a form submit.What you can have is a form in HTML, then submit it with the JavaScript. (as explained many times on this page)You can create the HTML yourself, you don\'t need JavaScript to write the HTML. That would be silly if people suggested that.Your function would just configure the form the way you want it.Then, use it like.But I would just leave out the function and just do.Finally, the style decision goes in the ccs file.Personally I think forms should be addressed by name but that is not important right now.this is the answer of rakesh, but with support for arrays (which is quite common in forms): plain javascript: oh, and here\'s the jquery version: (slightly different code, but boils down to the same thing)Well, wish I had read all the other posts so I didn\'t lose time creating this from Rakesh Pai\'s answer. Here\'s a recursive solution that works with arrays and objects.  No dependency on jQuery.Added a segment to handle cases where the entire form should be submitted like an array. (ie. where there\'s no wrapper object around a list of items)One solution is to generate the form and submit it. One implementation isSo I can implement a URL shortening bookmarklet with a simpleThree options here.Standard JavaScript answer: Use a framework! Most Ajax frameworks will have abstracted you an easy way to make an XMLHTTPRequest POST.Make the XMLHTTPRequest request yourself, passing post into the open method instead of get. (More information in Using POST method in XMLHTTPRequest (Ajax).)Via JavaScript, dynamically create a form, add an action, add your inputs, and submit that.Here is how I wrote it using jQuery. Tested in Firefox and InternetÂ Explorer.I\'d go down the Ajax route as others suggested with something like:The easiest way is using Ajax Post Request:where:Then in the success handler redirect the browser with something like window.location.The Prototype library includes a Hashtable object, with a ".toQueryString()" method, which allows you to easily turn a JavaScript object/structure into a query-string style string. Since the post requires the "body" of the request to be a query-string formatted string, this allows your Ajax request to work properly as a post. Here\'s an example using Prototype:It works perfect in my case.you can use it in function also like,Using this you can post all the values of inputs.FormObject is an option. But FormObject is not supported by most browsers now.This is like Alan\'s option 2 (above). How to instantiate the httpobj is left as an excercise.This is based on beauSD\'s code using jQuery. It is improved so it works recursively on objects.You could dynamically add the form using DHTML and then submit.You could use a library like jQuery and its $.post method.Yet another recursive solution, since some of others seem to be broken (I didn\'t test all of them). This one depends on lodash 3.x and ES6 (jQuery not required):You could make an AJAX call (likely using a library such as using Prototype.js or JQuery). AJAX can handle both GET and POST options.
