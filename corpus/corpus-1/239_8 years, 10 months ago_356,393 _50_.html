As I sometimes have path problems, where one of my own cmd scripts is hidden (shadowed) by another program (earlier on the path), I would like to be able to find the full path to a program on the Windows command line, given just its name.Is there an equivalent to the UNIX command \'which\'?On UNIX, which command prints the full path of the given command to easily find and repair these shadowing problems.Windows Server 2003 and later (i.e. anything after Windows XP 32 bit) provide the where.exe program which does some of what which does, though it matches all types of files, not just executable commands.  (It does not match built-in shell commands like cd.)  It will even accept wildcards, so where nt* finds all files in your %PATH% and current directory whose names start with nt.Try where /? for help.Note that Windows PowerShell defines where as an alias for the Where-Object cmdlet, so if you want where.exe, you need to type the full name instead of omitting the .exe extension.While later versions of Windows have a where command, you can also do this with Windows XP by using the environment variable modifiers, as follows:You don\'t need any extra tools and it\'s not limited to PATH since you can substitute any environment variable (in the path format, of course) that you wish to use.And, if you want one that can handle all the extensions in PATHEXT (as Windows itself does), this one does the trick:It actually returns all possibilities but you can tweak it quite easily for specific search rules.Under PowerShell get-command will find executables anywhere in $Env:PATH.It also finds powershell cmdlets, functions, aliases, files with custom executables extensions via $Env:PATHEXT, etc defined for the current shell (quite akin to bash\'s \ntype -a foo) - making it a better go-to than other tools like where.exe, which.exe, etc which are unaware of these PowerShell commands.You can quickly set up an alias with sal which gcm (short form of \nset-alias which get-command).If you have PowerShell installed (which I recommend), you can use the following command as a rough equivalent (substitue programName for your executable\'s name):More here:\nhttp://www.codeassassin.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,fd1967d1-f844-4e29-82e2-f2d6424b4ef9.aspxIn windows powershell:The GnuWin32 tools have which, along with a whole slew of other Unix tools.In Windows CMD which calls where:Surprised that nobody has mentioned cygwin as a solution yet.  If you don\'t mind using a 3rd-party solution, then cygwin is the way to go.Cygwin gives you the comfort of *nix in the Windows environment (and you can use it in your Windows command shell, or use a *nix shell of your choice).  It gives you a whole host of *nix commands (like which) for Windows, and you can just include that directory in your PATH.In PowerShell, it is gcm, which gives formatted information about other commands. If you want to retrieve only path to executable, use .Source.For instance: gcm git or (gcm git).SourceTidbits:Not in stock Windows but it is provided by Services for Unix and there are several simple batch scripts floating around that accomplish the same thing such this this one.The best version of this I\'ve found on Windows is Joseph Newcomer\'s "whereis" utility, which is available (with source) from his site.The article about the development of "whereis" is worth reading.Go get unxutils from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/gold on windows platforms, puts all the nice unix utilities on a standard windows DOS. Been using it for years.It has a \'which\' included. Note that it\'s case sensitive though.NB: to install it explode the zip somewhere and add ...\\UnxUtils\\usr\\local\\wbin\\ to your system path env variable.Dunno if this helps. Posted as answer because I don\'t know how to format code in comments (help?)  If you can find a free pascal compiler, you can compile this, or email me & I can try to dig one out, or mail back the exe or post it somewhere. I post the code, bad as it is, because at least it works & shows the algorithm necessary.  I have a function in my PowerShell profile named \'which\'Here\'s what the output looks like:I have created tool similar to Ned Batchelder:Searching .dll and .exe files in PATHWhile my tool is primarly for searching of various dll versions it shows more info (date, size, version) but it do not use PATHEXT (I hope to update my tool soon).None of the Win32 ports of Unix which that I could find on the Internet are satistactory, because they all have one or more of these shortcomings:So I eventually wrote my own which, that suports all the above correctly.Available there:\nhttp://jf.larvoire.free.fr/progs/which.exeThis batch file uses CMD variable handling to find the command that would be executed in the path.
