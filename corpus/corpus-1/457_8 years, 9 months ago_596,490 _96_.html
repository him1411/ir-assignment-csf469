What is the main difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?\nIs there any performance issues when deciding on any one of these?StringBuffer is synchronized, StringBuilder is not. StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer because it\'s not synchronized.Here\'s a simple benchmark test:A test run gives the numbers of 2241 ms for StringBuffer vs 753 ms for StringBuilder.Basically, StringBuffer methods are synchronized while StringBuilder are not.The operations are "almost" the same, but using synchronized methods in a single thread is overkill.That\'s pretty much about it.Quote from StringBuilder API:This class [StringBuilder] provides an API compatible with StringBuffer, but with no guarantee of synchronization. This class is designed for use as a drop-in replacement for StringBuffer in places where the string buffer was being used by a single thread (as is generally the case). Where possible, it is recommended that this class be used in preference to StringBuffer as it will be faster under most implementations.So it was made to substitute it.The same happened with Vector and ArrayList.But needed to get the clear difference with the help of an example?StringBuffer or StringBuilderSimply use StringBuilder unless you really are trying to share a buffer between threads. StringBuilder is the unsynchronized (less overhead = more efficient) younger brother of the original synchronized StringBuffer class.StringBuffer came first.  Sun was concerned with correctness under all conditions, so they made it synchronized to make it thread-safe just in case.StringBuilder came later.  Most of the uses of StringBuffer were single-thread and unnecessarily paying the cost of the synchronization.Since StringBuilder is a drop-in replacement for StringBuffer without the synchronization, there would not be differences between any examples.If you are trying to share between threads, you can use StringBuffer, but consider whether higher-level synchronization is necessary, e.g. perhaps instead of using StringBuffer, should you synchronize the methods that use the StringBuilder.First lets see the similarities:\nBoth StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable. That means you can change the content of them, with in the same location.Differences:\nStringBuffer is mutable and synchronized as well. Where as StringBuilder is mutable but not synchronized by default.Meaning of synchronized (synchronization):\nWhen some thing is synchronized, then multiple threads can access, and modify it with out any problem or side effect.\nStringBuffer is synchronized, so you can use it with multiple threads with out any problem.Which one to use when?\nStringBuilder : When you need a string, which can be modifiable, and only one thread is accessing and modifying it.\nStringBuffer : When you need a string, which can be modifiable, and multiple threads are accessing and modifying it.Note : Don\'t use StringBuffer unnecessarily, i.e., don\'t use it if only one thread is modifying and accessing it because it has lot of locking and unlocking code for synchronization which will unnecessarily take up CPU time. Don\'t use locks unless it is required. In single threads, StringBuffer is not significantly slower than StringBuilder, thanks to JVM optimisations. And in multithreading, you can\'t use safely a StringBuilder.Here is my test : Results :\nstrings: 319740\nBuffers : 23\nBuilder : 7 !So Builders are faster than Buffers, and WAY faster than strings concatenation.\nNow let\'s use an Executor for multiple threads :Now StringBuffers take 157 ms for 100000 appends. It\'s not the same test, but compared to the previous 37 ms, you can safely assume that StringBuffers appends are slower with multithreading use. The reason is that the JIT/hotspot/compiler/something makes optimizations when it detects that there is no need for checking locks.But with StringBuilder, you have java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, because a concurrent thread tries to add something where it should not. Conclusion is that you don\'t have to chase StringBuffers. And where you have threads, think about what they are doing, before trying to gain a few nanoseconds.StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5 so it won\'t work with earlier JVMs.From the Javadocs:StringBuilder class provides an API compatible with StringBuffer, but with no guarantee of synchronization. This class is designed for use as a drop-in replacement for StringBuffer in places where the string buffer was being used by a single thread (as is generally the case). Where possible, it is recommended that this class be used in preference to StringBuffer as it will be faster under most implementations. Pretty Good QuestionHere are the differences, i have noticed :StringBuffer :-StringBuilder:-Common thing :-Both have same methods with same signatures. Both are mutable.StringBuilder is not thread safe. String Buffer is. More info here.EDIT: As for performance , after hotspot kicks in , StringBuilder is the winner. However , for small iterations , the performance difference is negligible.StringBuilder and StringBuffer are almost the same. The difference is that StringBuffer is synchronized and StringBuilder is not. Although, StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer, the difference in performance is very little. StringBuilder is a SUN\'s replacement of StringBuffer. It just avoids synchronization from all the public methods. Rather than that, their functionality is the same.Example of good usage:If your text is going to change and is used by multiple threads, then it is better to use StringBuffer. If your text is going to change but is used by a single thread, then use StringBuilder.StringBufferStringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object . The object created through StringBuffer is stored in the heap .  StringBuffer  has the same methods as the StringBuilder , but each method in StringBuffer is synchronized that is StringBuffer is thread safe .because of this it does not allow  two threads to simultaneously access the same method . Each method can be accessed by one thread at a time .But being thread safe has disadvantages too as the performance of the StringBuffer hits due to thread safe property . Thus  StringBuilder is faster than the StringBuffer when calling the same methods of each class.StringBuffer value can be changed , it means it can be assigned to the new value . Nowadays its a most common interview question ,the differences between the above classes .\nString Buffer can be converted to the string by using\ntoString() method.StringBuilderStringBuilder  is same as the StringBuffer , that is it stores the object in heap and it can also be modified . The main difference between the StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuilder is also not thread safe. \nStringBuilder is fast as it is not thread safe .Resource: String Vs StringBuffer Vs StringBuilderStringBuffer\n - Synchronized hence threadsafe\n - thread safe hence slow\n - StringBuilder\n - Introduced in java 5.0\n - Asynchronous hence fast & efficient\n - User explicitly need to synchronized it, if he wants\n - You can replace it will StringBuilder without a any other change The javadoc explains the difference:This class provides an API compatible with StringBuffer, but with no guarantee of synchronization. This class is designed for use as a drop-in replacement for StringBuffer in places where the string buffer was being used by a single thread (as is generally the case). Where possible, it is recommended that this class be used in preference to StringBuffer as it will be faster under most implementations.StringBuilder (introduced in Java 5) is identical to StringBuffer, except its methods are not synchronized.  This means it has better performance than the latter, but the drawback is that it is not thread-safe.Read tutorial for more details.String is an immutable.StringBuffer is a mutable and synchronized. StringBuilder is also mutable but its not synchronized.StringBuilder is  much faster than StringBuffer because It\'s non synchronized.Here you got more idea about the cost of synchronize Let take programmatically look how much StringBuilder faster than StringBufferOutPutTime taken by StringBuffer: 16msTime taken by StringBuilder: 0msA simple program illustrating the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder:StringBuffer is synchronized, but StringBuilder is not. As a result, StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer.StringBuffer\nis mutable. It can change in terms of length and content. StringBuffers are thread-safe, meaning that they have synchronized methods to control access so that only one thread can access a StringBuffer object\'s synchronized code at a time. Thus, StringBuffer objects are generally safe to use in a multi-threaded environment where multiple threads may be trying to access the same StringBuffer object at the same time.StringBuilder\nThe StringBuilder class is very similar to StringBuffer, except that its access is not synchronized so that it is not thread-safe. By not being synchronized, the performance of StringBuilder can be better than StringBuffer. Thus, if you are working in a single-threaded environment, using StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer may result in increased performance. This is also true of other situations such as a StringBuilder local variable (ie, a variable within a method) where only one thread will be accessing a StringBuilder object.StringBufferStringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object . The object created through StringBuffer is stored in the heap . StringBuffer  has the same methods as the StringBuilder , but each method in StringBuffer is synchronized that is StringBuffer is thread safe . StringBuilderStringBuilder  is same as the StringBuffer , that is it stores the object in heap and it can also be modified . The main difference between the StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuilder is not thread safe. \nStringBuilder is fast as it is not thread safe .  StringBuffer is used to store character strings that will be changed (String objects cannot be changed). It automatically expands as needed. Related classes: String, CharSequence.StringBuilder was added in Java 5. It is identical in all respects to StringBuffer except that it is not synchronized, which means that if multiple threads are accessing it at the same time, there could be trouble. For single-threaded programs, the most common case, avoiding the overhead of synchronization makes the StringBuilder very slightly faster.Better use StringBuilder since it is not synchronized and therefor better performance. StringBuilder is a drop-in replacement of the older StringBuffer.StringBuffer:StringBuilderThis link will make you understand the concepts of not only StringBuilder and StringBuffer but also their association and difference with String class. This will make you understand when to use which class.\nhttp://www.acquireandinspire.org/2013/01/string-string-builder-string-buffer.htmlThere are no basic differences between StringBuilder and StringBuffer, only a few differences exist between them. In StringBuffer the methods are synchronized. This means that at a time only one thread can operate on them. If there are more than one thread then the second thread will have to wait for the first one to finish and the third one will have to wait for the first and second one to finish and so on. This makes the process very slow and hence the performance in case of StringBuffer is low.On the other hand StringBuilder is non synchronized. This means that at a time multiple threads can operate on the same StrinBuilder object at the same time. This makes the process very fast and hence performance of StringBuilder is high.Check the internals of synchronized append method of StringBuffer and non-synchronized append method of StringBuilder.StringBuffer:StringBuilder:Since append is synchronized, StringBuffer has performance overhead compared to StrinbBuilder in multi-threading scenario. As long as you are not sharing buffer among multiple threads, use StringBuilder, which is fast due to absence of synchronized in append methods.Since StringBuffer is synchronized, it needs some extra effort, hence based on perforamance, its a bit slow than StringBuilder.String-Builder :String-BufferIt is recommended to use StringBuilder whenever possible because it is faster than StringBuffer. However, if the thread safety is necessary, the best option is StringBuffer objects.String is an immutable object which means the value cannot be changed where as StringBuffer is mutable.The StringBuffer is Synchronized hence thread safe where as StringBuilder is not and suitable for only single threaded instances.Every method present in StringBuffer is Synchronized.\nhence at a time only one thread is allowed to operate StringBuffer object.\nIt Increases waiting time of a Thread and Creates Performance problems\nto overcome this problem SUN People intoduced StringBuilder in 1.5 version.
