How would I write the equivalent of C#\'s String.StartsWith in JavaScript?Note: This is an old question, and as pointed out in the comments ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) introduced the .startsWith method. However, at the time of writing this update (2015) browser support is far from complete.You can use ECMAScript 6\'s String.prototype.startsWith() method, but it\'s not yet supported in all browsers. You\'ll want to use a shim/polyfill to add it on browsers that don\'t support it. Creating an implementation that complies with all the details laid out in the spec is a little complicated, and the version defined in this answer won\'t do; if you want a faithful shim, use either:Once you\'ve shimmed the method (or if you\'re only supporting browsers and JavaScript engines that already have it), you can use it like this:Another alternative with .lastIndexOf:This looks backwards through haystack for an occurrence of needle starting from index 0 of haystack. In other words, it only checks if haystack starts with needle.In principle, this should have performance advantages over some other approaches:Without a helper function, just using regex\'s .test method:To do this with a dynamic string rather than a hardcoded one (assuming that the string will not contain any regexp control characters):You should check out Is there a RegExp.escape function in Javascript? if the possibility exists that regexp control characters appear in the string.I just wanted to add my opinion about this.I think we can just use like this:Here is a minor improvement to CMS\'s solution:Checking whether the function already exists in case a future browser implements it in native code or if it is implemented by another library. For example, the Prototype Library implements this function already.Using ! is slightly faster and more concise than === 0 though not as readable.Best solution:And here is endsWith if you need that too: Also check out underscore.string.js. It comes with a bunch of useful string testing and manipulation methods, including a startsWith method. From the docs:startsWith _.startsWith(string, starts)This method checks whether string starts with starts.I recently asked myself the same question.\nThere are multiple possible solutions, here are 3 valid ones:using a loop:I haven\'t come across the last solution which makes uses of a loop.\nSurprisingly this solution outperforms the first 3 by a significant margin.\nHere is the jsperf test I performed to reach this conclusion: http://jsperf.com/startswith2/2Peaceps: ecmascript 6 (harmony) introduces a native startsWith method for strings.\nJust think how much time would have been saved if they had thought of including this much needed method in the initial version itself.UpdateAs Steve pointed out (the first comment on this answer), the above custom function will throw an error if the given prefix is shorter than the whole string. He has fixed that and added a loop optimization which can be viewed at http://jsperf.com/startswith2/4.Note that there are 2 loop optimizations which Steve included, the first of the two showed better performance, thus I will post that code below:Since this is so popular I think it is worth pointing out that there is an implementation for this method in ECMA 6 and in preparation for that one should use the \'official\' polyfill in order to prevent future problems and tears.Luckily the experts at Mozilla provide us with one:https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/startsWithPlease note that this has the advantage of getting gracefully ignored on transition to ECMA 6.The best performant solution is to stop using library calls and just recognize that you\'re working with two arrays. A hand-rolled implementation is both short and also faster than every other solution I\'ve seen here.For performance comparisons (success and failure), see http://jsperf.com/startswith2/4. (Make sure you check for later versions that may have trumped mine.)I just learned about this string library:http://stringjs.com/Include the js file and then use the S variable like this:It can also be used in NodeJS by installing it:Then requiring it as the S variable:The web page also has links to alternate string libraries, if this one doesn\'t take your fancy.Based on the answers here, this is the version I am now using, as it seems to give the best performance based on JSPerf testing (and is functionally complete as far as I can tell).This was based on startsWith2 from here: http://jsperf.com/startswith2/6. I added a small tweak for a tiny performance improvement, and have since also added a check for the comparison string being null or undefined, and converted it to add to the String prototype using the technique in CMS\'s answer.Note that this implementation doesn\'t support the "position" parameter which is mentioned in this Mozilla Developer Network page, but that doesn\'t seem to be part of the ECMAScript proposal anyway.I was looking for performance so I ran the functions through jsperf. I tested the functions against subject and search strings of various sizes and it appears that all methods exhibit different performance of different inputs; the general pattern is that performance degrades as length of search string increases.The overall winner turns out to be the substr(ing) method.https://jsperf.com/javascript-string-startswithYou can also return all members of an array that start with a string by creating your own prototype / extension to the the array prototype, akaAnd to use it:If you are working with startsWith() and endsWith() then you have to be careful about leading spaces. Were is the complete example:
