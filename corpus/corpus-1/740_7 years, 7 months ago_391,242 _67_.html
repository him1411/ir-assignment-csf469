How can I get the current absolute URL in my Ruby on Rails view?The request.request_uri only returns the relative URL.You should use request.original_url to get the current URL.This method is documented at original_url method, but if you\'re curious, the implementation is:You can write "#{request.protocol}#{request.host_with_port}#{request.fullpath}", since request.url is now deprecated.You  can write request.url instead of request.request_uri.  This combines the protocol (usually http://) with the host, and request_uri to give you the full address.I think that the Ruby on Rails 3.0 method is now request.fullpath.You could use url_for(:only_path => false)DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #request_uri is deprecated. Use fullpath instead. If you\'re using Rails 3.2 or Rails 4 you should use request.original_url to get the current URL.Documentation for the method is at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Request.html#method-i-original_url but if you\'re curious the implementation is:You can add this current_url method in the ApplicationController to return the current URL and allow merging in other parametersExample Usage:For Ruby on Rails 3:I fired up a debugger session and queried the request object:In Ruby on Rails 3.1.0.rc4:I needed the application URL but with the subdirectory. I used:And you can easily add some new parameter:I think request.domain would work, but what if you\'re in a sub directory like blah.blah.com? Something like this could work:Change the parameters based on your path structure. Hope that helps!It looks like request_uri is deprecated in Ruby on Rails 3.This works for Ruby on Rails 3.0 and should be supported by most versions of Ruby on Rails:Using Ruby 1.9.3-p194 and Ruby on Rails 3.2.6:If request.fullpath doesn\'t work for you, try request.env["HTTP_REFERER"]Here\'s my story below.I got similar problem with detecting current URL (which is shown in address bar for user in her browser) for cumulative pages which combines information from different controllers, for example, http://localhost:3002/users/1/history/issues.The user can switch to different lists of types of issues. All those lists are loaded via Ajax from different controllers/partials (without reloading).The problem was to set the correct path for the back button in each item of the list so the back button could work correctly both in its own page and in the cumulative page history.In case I use request.fullpath, it returns the path of last JavaScript request which is definitely not the URL I\'m looking for.So I used request.env["HTTP_REFERER"] which stores the URL of the last reloaded request.Here\'s an excerpt from the partial to make a decisionNone of the suggestions here in the thread helped me sadly, except the one where someone said he used the debugger to find what he looked for.I\'ve created some custom error pages instead of the standard 404 and 500, but request.url ended in /404 instead of the expected /non-existing-mumbo-jumbo.What I needed to use wasIf by relative, you mean just without the domain, then look into request.domain.You can use the ruby method:which will get the full path:\nlocalhost:3000/blaIn Rails 3 you can usehttp://apidock.com/rails/v3.2.8/ActionDispatch/Request/original_urlRails 4.0you can use request.original_url, output will be as given below exampleif you want to be specific, meaning, you know the path you need: For rails 3 :request.fullpathworks in rails 2.3.4 tested and do not know about other versions.you can use any one for rails 3.2:I think it will work every whereTo get the request URL without any query parameters.You can use:or Hopefully it will resolve your problem.CheersYou can either use    or    to get the current URL.To get the absolute URL which means that the from the root it can be displayed like this The users_url helper generates a URL that includes the protocol and host \nname.  The users_path helper generates only the path portion.Rails 4Controller:Action Mailer Notable changes in 4.2 release:link_to and url_for generate absolute URLs by default in templates, it is no longer needed to pass only_path: false. (Commit)View:If you use the _url suffix, the generated URL is absolute. Use _path to get a relative URL.For More Details, go to:http://blog.grepruby.com/2015/04/absolute-url-full-url-in-rails-4.htmlYou can set a variable to URI.parse(current_url), I don\'t see this proposal here yet and it works for me.
