How do you delete a git tag that has already been pushed?You just need to push an \'empty\' reference to the remote tag name:Or, more expressively, use the --delete option:If you also need to delete the local tag, use:Pushing a branch, tag, or other ref to a remote repository involves specifying "push where, what source, what destination?"A real world example where you push your master branch to the origin\'s master branch is:Which because of default paths, can be shortened to:Tags work the same way:Which can also be shortened to:By omitting the source ref (the part before the colon), you push \'nothing\' to the destination, deleting the ref on the remote end.A more straightforward way is IMO prefixing colon syntax is a little bit odd in this situationIf you have a remote tag v0.1.0 to delete, and your remote is origin, then simply:If you also need to delete the tag locally:See Adam Franco\'s answer for an explanation of Git\'s unusual : syntax for deletion.Delete all local tags and get the list of remote tags:Remove all remote tagsClean up local tagsTo remove the tag from the remote repository:You may also want to delete the tag locally:From your terminal, do this:Now go to Github.com and refresh, they disappear.Just notice that, if you have a remote branch named as a remote tag, these commands are ambiguous:So you must use this command to delete the tag:and this one to delete the branch:If not, you would get an error like this:If you have created a tag called release01 in a Git repository you would remove it from your repository by doing the following:To remove one from a Mercurial repository:Please reference https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=282175551The other answers point out how to accomplish this, but you should keep in mind the consequences since this is a remote repository.The git tag man page, in the On Retagging section, has a good explanation of how to courteously inform the remote repo\'s other users of the change. They even give a handy announcement template for communicating how others should get your changes.Simple script to remove given tag from both local and origin locations.\nWith a check if tag really exists.How to use:Seems like a lot of work for something xargs already does. Looking back through this thread, I\'m guessing the slowness with xargs that you experienced is because the original answer used xargs -n 1 when it didn\'t really need to.This is equivalent to your method one except that xargs automatically deals with the maximum command line length:xargs can run processes in parallel too. Method 2 with xargs:The above uses a maximum of 5 processes to handle a maximum of 100 arguments in each process. You can experiment with the arguments to find what works best for your needs.After reading through these answers while needing to delete over 11,000 tags, I learned these methods relying or xargs take far too long, unless you have hours to burn.Struggling, I found two much faster ways. For both, start with git tag or git ls-remote --tags to make a list of tags you want to delete on the remote. In the examples below you can omit or replace sorting_proccessing_etc with any greping, sorting, tailing or heading you want (e.g. grep -P "my_regex" | sort | head -n -200 etc) :How does this work?\nThe normal, line-separated list of tags is converted to a single line of space-separated tags, each prepended with : so . . .Using git push with this format tag pushes nothing into each remote ref, erasing it (the normal format for pushing this way is local_ref_path:remote_ref_path).After both of these methods, you\'ll probably want to delete your local tags too.\nThis is much faster so we can go back to using xargs and git tag -d, which is sufficient.OR similar to the remote delete:\nIf you\'re using PowerShell, and you want to delete a bunch of them:Of course, you can also filter them before deleting:As @CubanX suggested, I\'ve split this answer from my original:parallel has many operating modes, but generally parallelizes any command you give it while allowing you to set limits on the number of processes. You can alter the --jobs 2 parameter to allow faster operation, but I had problems with Github\'s rate limits, which are currently 5000/hr, but also seems to have an undocumented short-term limit as well.After this, you\'ll probably want to delete your local tags too.\nThis is much faster so we can go back to using xargs and git tag -d, which is sufficient.
