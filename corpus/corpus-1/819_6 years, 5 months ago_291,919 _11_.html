Possible Duplicate:\n  How to stash only one file out of multiple files that have changed How can I stash a specific file leaving the others currently modified out of the stash I am about to save?For example, if git status gives me this:and I only want to stash app/views/cart/welcome.thtml, how would I do that? Something like (but of course this does not work):EDIT: Since git 2.13, there is a command to save a specific path to the stash: git stash push <path>. For example: git stash push -m welcome_cart app/views/cart/welcome.thtml.OLD ANSWER:You can do that using git stash --patch (or git stash -p) -- you\'ll enter interactive mode where you\'ll be presented with each hunk that was changed. Use n to skip the files that you don\'t want to stash, y when you encounter the one that you want to stash, and q to quit and leave the remaining hunks unstashed.  a will stash the shown hunk and the rest of the hunks in that file.Not the most user-friendly approach, but it gets the work done if you really need it.I usually add to index changes I don\'t want to stash and then stash with --keep-index option.Last step is optional, but usually you want it.  It removes changes from index.Warning\nAs noted in the comments, this puts everything into the stash, both staged and unstaged. The --keep-index just leaves the index alone after the stash is done. This can cause merge conflicts when you later pop the stash.
