I would like to retain (for now) the ability to link Git changesets to workitems stored in TFS.I already wrote a tool (using a hook from Git) in which I can inject workitemidentifiers into the message of a Git changeset. However, I would also like to store the identifier of the Git commit (the hash) into a custom TFS workitem field. This way I can examine a workitem in TFS and see what Git changesets are associated with the workitem.How can I easily retrieve the hash from the current commit from Git?To turn arbitrary extended object reference into SHA-1, use simply git-rev-parse, for exampleorSidenote: If you want to turn references (branches and tags) into SHA-1, there is git show-ref and git for-each-ref.If you only want the shortened hash:Further, using %H is another way to get the long hash.Another one, using git log:It\'s very similar to the of @outofculture though a bit shorter.For completeness, since no-one has suggested it yet.  .git/refs/heads/master is a file that contains only one line: the hash of the latest commit on master.  So you could just read it from there.Or, as as command:Update:Note that git now supports storing some head refs in the pack-ref file instead of as a file in the /refs/heads/ folder.  https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pack-refs.htmlTo get the full SHA:To get the shortened version:There\'s always git describe as well. By default it gives you --Use git rev-list --max-count=1 HEADIf you need to store the hash in a variable during a script, you can useOr, if you only want the first 10 characters (like github.com does)Commit hashAbbreviated commit hashClick here for more git show examples.The most succinct way I know:If you want a specific number of digits of the hash you can add:If you want the super-hacky way to do it:Basically, git stores the location of HEAD in .git/HEAD, in the form ref: {path from .git}.  This command reads that out, slices off the "ref: ", and reads out whatever file it pointed to.This, of course, will fail in detached-head mode, as HEAD won\'t be "ref:...", but the hash itself - but you know, I don\'t think you expect that much smarts in your bash one-liners.  If you don\'t think semicolons are cheating, though...Perhaps you want an alias so you don\'t have to remember all the nifty details. After doing one of the below steps, you will be able to simply type:Following up on the accepted answer, here are two ways to set this up:1) Teach git the explicit way by editing the global config (my original answer):2) Or if you like a shortcut to teach git a shortcut, as recently commented by Adrien:From here on, use git lastcommit to show the last commit\'s hash.If you\'re going for speed though, the approach mentioned by Deestanis significantly faster than any other method listed here so far.in your home-dir  in file  ".gitconfig"  add the followingthen you will have an easier command to remember: Here is another way of doing it with :)Here is another direct-access implementation:This also works over http which is useful for local package archives (I know: for public web sites it\'s not recommended to make the .git directory accessable):
