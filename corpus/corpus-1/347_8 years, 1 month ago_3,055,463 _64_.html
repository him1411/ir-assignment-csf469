How do I declare and initialize an array in Java?You can either use array declaration or array literal (but only when you declare and affect the variable right away, array literals cannot be used for re-assigning an array). For primitive types: For classes, for example String, it\'s the same:The third way of initialising is useful when you declare the array first and then initialise it. Cast is necessary here.There are two types of array. Syntax for default values:Or (less preferred)Syntax with values given (variable/field initialization):Or (less preferred)Note: For convenience  int[] num is preferable because it clearly tells that you are talking here about array. Otherwise no difference. Not at all.OrOrOrSo here we are defining columns explicitly.\nAnother Way: Alternatively:Ragged arrays are multidimensional arrays.\nFor explanation see multidimensional array detail at the official java tutorialsis also valid, but I prefer the brackets after the type, because it\'s easier to see that the variable\'s type is actually an array.There are a various ways in which you can declare an array in Java:You can find more information on the Sun Tutorial site and the JavaDoc.I find it is helpful if you understand each part:Type[] is the type of the variable called name ("name" is called the identifier).  The literal "Type" is the base type, and the brackets mean this is the array type of that base. Array types are in turn types of their own, which allows you to make multidimensional arrays like Type[][] (the array type of Type[]). The keyword new says to allocate memory for the new array.  The number between the bracket says how large the new array will be and how much memory to allocate. For instance, if Java knows that the base type Type takes 32 bytes, and you want an array of size 5, it needs to internally allocate 32 * 5 = 160 bytes.You can also create arrays with the values already there, such aswhich not only creates the empty space but fills it with those values. Java can tell that the primitives are integers and that there are 5 of them, so the size of the array can be determined implicitly.The following shows the declaration of an array, but the array is not initialized:The following shows the declaration as well as initialization of the array:Now, the following also shows the declaration as well as initialization of the array:But this third one shows the property of anonymous array-object creation which is pointed by a reference variable "myIntArray", so if we write just "new int[]{1,2,3};" then this is how anonymous array-object can be created.If we just write:this is not declaration of array, but the following statement makes the above declaration complete:Also, in case you want something more dynamic there is the List interface.  This will not perform as well, but is more flexible:Alternatively,That declares an array called arrayName of size 10 (you have elements 0 through 9 to use).There are two main ways to make an array:This one, for an empty array:And this one, for an initialized array:You can also make multidimensional arrays, like this:Take the primitive type int for example. There are several ways to declare and int array:where in all of these, you can use int i[] instead of int[] i.With reflection, you can use (Type[]) Array.newInstance(Type.class, capacity);Note that in method parameters, ... indicates variable arguments. Essentially, any number of parameters is fine. It\'s easier to explain with code:Inside the method, varargs is treated as a normal int[]. Type... can only be used in method parameters, so int... i = new int[] {} will not compile.Note that when passing an int[] to a method (or any other Type[]), you cannot use the third way. In the statement int[] i = *{a, b, c, d, etc}*, the compiler assumes that the {...} means an int[]. But that is because you are declaring a variable. When passing an array to a method, the declaration must either be new Type[capacity] or new Type[] {...}.Multidimensional arrays are much harder to deal with. Essentially, a 2D array is an array of arrays. int[][] means an array of int[]s. The key is that if an int[][] is declared as int[x][y], the maximum index is i[x-1][y-1]. Essentially, a rectangular int[3][5] is:If you want to create arrays using reflections then you can do like this:Declaring an array of object references:Array is a sequential list of itemsIf it\'s an object, then it\'s the same conceptIn case of objects, you need to either assign it to null to initialize them using new Type(..), classes like String and Integer are special cases that will be handled as followingIn general you can create arrays that\'s M dimensionalIt\'s worthy to note that creating an M dimensional array is expensive in terms of Space. Since when you create an M dimensional array with N on all the dimensions, The total size of the array is bigger than N^M, since each array has a reference, and at the M-dimension there is an (M-1)-dimensional array of references. The total size is as followingFor creating arrays of class Objects you can use the java.util.ArrayList. to define an array:Assign values to the array:Read from the array:Note:variableName is a reference to the array meaning that manipulating variableName will manipulate arrayNamefor loops:for loop that allows you to edit arrayName (conventional for loop):Another way to declare and initialize ArrayList:Declare and initialize for Java 8 and later. Create simple integer array:Create random array for integer between [-50, 50) and for double (0, 1E17):power of two sequence:For String[] you must specify a constructorMultidimensional Arrays:
