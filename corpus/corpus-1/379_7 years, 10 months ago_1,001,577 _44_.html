How do I concatenate two lists in Python?Example:Expected outcome:Python makes this ridiculously easy.It\'s also possible to create a generator that simply iterates over the items in both lists.  This allows you to chain lists (or any iterable) together for processing without copying the items to a new list:You can use sets to obtain merged list of unique valuesYou could also use extend in order to add a list add the end of another one:This is quite simple, I think it was even shown in the tutorial:Python >= 3.5 alternative: [*l1, *l2]Even though this is an old answer, another alternative has been introduced via the acceptance of PEP 448 which deserves mentioning. The PEP, titled Additional Unpacking Generalizations, generally reduced some syntactic restrictions when using the starred * expression in Python; with it, joining two lists (applies to any iterable) can now also be done with:This functionality was defined for Python 3.5; from testing it in 3.4 I don\'t belive it has been backported to previous versions in the 3.x family. In unsupported versions a SyntaxError is going to be raised.The upside to this approach is that you really don\'t need lists in order to perform it, anything that is iterable will do. As stated in the PEP:This is also useful as a more readable way of summing iterables into a\n  list, such as my_list + list(my_tuple) + list(my_range) which is now\n  equivalent to just [*my_list, *my_tuple, *my_range].So while addition with + would raise a TypeError due to type mismatch:The following won\'t:because it will first unpack the contents of the iterables and then simply create a list from the contents.A nice little perk is that it\'s also faster than the other approaches:itertools.chain closes this gap when the sizes of the lists go (on my machine at-least) beyond 1m elements. (in which case you probably shouldn\'t be using Python lists :-) You could simply use the + or += operator as follows:Or:Also, if you want the values in the merged list to be unique you can do:This question directly asks about joining two lists. However it\'s pretty high in search even when you are looking for a way of joining many lists (including the case when you joining zero lists). Consider this more generic approach:Will output:Note, this also works correctly when a is [] or [[1,2,3]].UpdateConsider better alternative suggested by Patrick Collins in the comments:It\'s worth noting that the itertools.chain function accepts variable number of arguments:If an iterable (tuple, list, generator, etc.) is the input, the from_iterable class method may be used:With Python 3.3+ you can use yield from:Or, if you want to support an arbitrary number of iterators:If you want to merge the two lists in sorted form, you can use merge function from the heapq library.If you don\'t want to or can\'t use the plus operator (+), you can uses the  __add__ function:Joining two lists in Python:If you don\'t want any duplication:If you need to merge two ordered lists with complicated sorting rules, you might have to roll it yourself like in the following code (using a simple sorting rule for readability :-) ).As a more general way for more lists you can put them within a list and use itertools.chain.from_iterable()1 function which based on THIS answer is the best way for flatting a nested list :\n1. Note that chain.from_iterable() is available in python =>2.6.In other versions use chain(*l)\nYou could use the append() method defined on list objects: The above code, does not preserve order, removes duplicate from each list (but not from the concatenated list)As already pointed out by many, itertools.chain() is the way to go if one needs to apply exactly the same treatment to both lists. In my case, I had a label and a flag which were different from one list to the other, so I needed something slightly more complex. As it turns out, behind the scenes itertools.chain() simply does the following:(see https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html), so I took inspiration from here and wrote something along these lines:The main points to understand here are that lists are just a special case of iterable, which are objects like any other; and that for ... in loops in python can work with tuple variables, so it is simple to loop on multiple variables at the same time. If you wanted a new list whilst keeping the two old lists:
