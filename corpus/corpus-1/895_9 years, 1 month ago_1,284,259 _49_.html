I need to pass id and password to a cmd (or bat) file at the time of running rather than hardcoding them into the file.Here\'s what the command line looks like:Another useful tip is to use %* to mean "all". For example,When you run:the above batch file will run:I may have the syntax slightly wrong, but this is the general idea.Here\'s how I do it.Here\'s what the command line looks like:The %1 applies to the first parameter the %2 (and here\'s the tricky part) applies to the second. You can have up to 9 parameters passed in this way.If you want to intelligently handle missing parameters you can do something like:Accessing batch parameters can be simple with %1, %2, ... %9 or also %*,\nbut only if the content is simple.  There is no simple way for complex contents like "&"^&, as it`s not possible to access %1 without producing an error.  The lines expands to  And each line fails, as one of the & is outside of the quotes.It can be solved with reading from a temporary file a remarked version of the parameter.The trick is to enable echo on and expand the %1 after a rem statement (works also with %2 .. %*).\nSo even "&"& could be echoed without producing an error, as it is remarked.  But to be able to redirect the output of the echo on, you need the two FOR-LOOPS.The extra characters * # are used to be safe against contents like /? (would show the help for REM).\nOr a caret ^ at the line end could work as a multiline character, even in after a rem.  Then reading the rem parameter output from the file, but carefully.\nThe FOR /F should work with delayed expansion off, else contents with "!" would be destroyed.\nAfter removing the extra characters in param1, you got it.And to use param1 in a safe way, enable the delayed expansion.Yep, and just don\'t forget to use variables like %%1 when using if and for and the gang.If you forget the double %, then you will be substituting in (possibly null) command line arguments and you will receive some pretty confusing error messages.There is no need to complicate it. It is simply command %1 %2 parameters, for example,The "pause" displays what the batch file has done and waits for you to hit the ANY key. Save that as xx.bat in the Windows folder.To use it, type, for example:This batch file takes care of all the necessary parameters, like copying only files, that are newer, etc. I have used it since before Windows. If you like seeing the names of the files, as they are being copied, leave out the Q parameter.Note:   IF "%1"=="" will cause problems if %1 is enclosed in quotes itself.In that case, use IF [%1]==[] or, in NT 4 (SP6) and later only, IF "%~1"=="" instead.Let\'s keep this simple.Here is the .cmd file.Here are 3 calls from the command line.I wrote a simple read_params script that can be called as a function (or external .bat) and will put all variables into the current environment. It won\'t modify the original parameters because the function is being called with a copy of the original parameters.For example, given the following command:myscript.bat would be able to use the variables after calling the function:Here\'s the function:LimitationsChangelogThis loops over the batch parameters (%*) either they are quoted or not, then echos each parameter.  To refer to a set variable in command line you would need to use " %a% " so for example:Note: This works for Windows 7 pro.A friend was asking me about this subject recently, so I thought I\'d post how I handle command-line arguments in batch files.This technique has a bit of overhead as you\'ll see, but it makes my batch files very easy to understand and quick to implement. As well as supporting the following structures:The jist of it is having the :init, :parse, and :main functions.Example usagetemplate.batMake a new batch file (example: openclass.bat) and write this line in the file:Then place the batch file in, let\'s say, the system32 folder, go to your Java class file, right click, Properties, Open with..., then find your batch file, select it and that\'s that...It works for me.PS: I can\'t find a way to close the cmd window when I close the Java class. For now...
