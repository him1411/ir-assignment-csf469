I\'m trying to figure out how I can download a particular tag of a Git repository - it\'s one version behind the current version.I saw there was a tag for the previous version on the git web page, with object name of something long hex number. But the version name is "Tagged release 1.1.5" according the site.I tried a command like this (with names changed):And I did get something - a directory, a bunch of subdirectories, etc.  If it\'s the whole repository, how do I get at the version I\'m seeking? If not, how do I download that particular version? $ git clone will give you the whole repository.After the clone, you can list the tags with $ git tag -l and then checkout a specific tag:$ git checkout tags/<tag_name>Even better, checkout and create a branch (otherwise you will be on a branch named after the revision number of tag):$ git checkout tags/<tag_name> -b <branch_name>Will clone the repo and leave you on the tag you are interested in.Documentation for 1.8.5.2 of git clone states.--branch can also take tags and detaches the HEAD at that commit in the resulting repository.I\'m not a git expert, but I think this should work:ORThe second variation establishes a new branch based on the tag, which lets you avoid a \'detached HEAD\'. (git-checkout manual)Every git repo contains the entire revision history, so cloning the repo gives you access to the latest commit, plus everything that came before, including the tag you\'re looking for.You can use git archive to download a tar ball for a given tag or commit id:You can also export a zip archive of a tag.List tags:Export a tag:Notes:For checking out only a given tag for deployment, I use e.g.:This seems to be the fastest way to check out code from a remote repository if one has only interest in the most recent code instead of in a complete repository. In this way, it resembles the \'svn co\' command.Use the --single-branch switch (available as of Git 1.7.10). The syntax is:For example:The benefit: Git will receive objects and (need to) resolve deltas for the specified branch/tag only - while checking out the exact same amount of files! Depending on the source repository, this will save you a lot of disk space. (Plus, it\'ll be much quicker.)first fetch all the tags in that specific remote or just simply typeThen check for the available tags then switch to that specific tag using below commandHope this will helps you!If your tags are sortable using the linux sort command, use this:eg. if git tag returns:git tag | sort -n | tail -1 will output:git tag | sort -n | tail -2 | head -1 will output:(because you asked for the second most recent tag)to checkout the tag, first clone the repo, then type:..or whatever tag you need.I checked the git checkout documentation, it revealed one interesting thing:git checkout -b <new_branch_name> <start_point>\n  , where the <start_point> is the name of a commit\n  at which to start the new branch;\n  Defaults to HEADSo we can mention the tag name( as tag is nothing but a name of a commit) as, say:>> git checkout -b 1.0.2_branch 1.0.2 \n  later, modify some files \n  >> git push --tagsP.S: In Git, you can\'t update a tag directly(since tag is just a label to a commit), you need to checkout the same tag as a branch and then commit to it and then create a separate tag.===================================I just did this. First I made sure I knew the tag name spelling.This gave me a list of tags on my git server to choose from. \nThe original poster already knew his tag\'s name so this step is not necessary for everyone.\nThe output looked like this, though the real list was longer.I picked the tag I wanted and fetched that and nothing more as follows.I then tagged this on my local machine, giving my tag the same name.I didn\'t want to clone the remote repository as other people have suggested doing, as the project I am working on is large and I want to develop in a nice clean environment. I feel this is closer to the original questions "I\'m trying to figure out how do download A PARTICULAR TAG" than the solution which suggests cloning the whole repository. I don\'t see why anyone should have to have a copy of Windows NT and Windows 8.1 source code if they want to look at DOS 0.1 source code (for example).I also didn\'t want to use CHECKOUT as others have suggested. I had a branch checked out and didn\'t want to affect that. My intention was to fetch the software I wanted so that I could cherry-pick something and add that to my development.There is probably a way to fetch the tag itself rather than just a copy of the commit that was tagged. I had to tag the fetched commit myself. EDIT: Ah yes, I have found it now.Where you see the colon, that is remote-name:local-name and here they are the tag names. This runs without upsetting the working tree etc. It just seems to copy stuff from the remote to the local machine so you have your own copy.with the --dry-run option added will let you have a look at what the command would do, if you want to verify its what you want. So I guess a simpleis the real answer.=A separate note about tags ... When I start something new I usually tag the empty repository after git init, sincerequires a commit, and the question arises "how do you rebase changes that include your first software change?" So when I start working I do i.e. create a commit before my first real change and then later useif I want to rebase all my work, including the first change.Working off of Peter Johnson\'s answer, I created a nice little alias for myself:aka \'git checkout latest tag\'.This relies on the GNU version of sort, which appropriately handles situations like the one lOranger pointed out:If you\'re on a mac, brew install coreutils and then call gsort instead.try:I do this is via the github API:Clone with -b option also helps: \ngit clone https://git01.codeplex.com/aspnetwebstack.git -b v2.0The following post uses the above option to download asp.net mvc:\nhttp://vijayt.com/Post/Setting-up-aspnet-mvc-for-debugging-in-your-system
