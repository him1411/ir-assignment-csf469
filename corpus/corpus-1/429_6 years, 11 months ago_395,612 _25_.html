I\'m trying to put a submodule into a repo.  The problem is that when I clone the parent repo, the submodule folder is entirely empty.Is there any way to make it so that \'git clone parent\' actually puts data in the submodule folder?example: http://github.com/cwolves/sequelize/tree/master/lib/nodejs-mysql-native is pointing at an external git, but when I checkout the sequelize project, that folder is empty...With version 1.9 of Git and later, you can even download the submodules simultaneously:Editor\'s note: simultaneously in this case means: in parallel; that is,\n -j8 is an optional performance optimization that fetches up to 8 submodules at a time in parallel - see man git-clone.With version 1.6.5 of Git and later, you can use:For already cloned repos, or older Git versions, just use:You have to do two things before a submodule will be filled:Original answer 2010As joschi mentions in the comments, git submodule now supports the --recursive option (Git1.6.5 and more). If --recursive is specified, this command will recurse into the registered submodules, and update any nested submodules within.See Working with git submodules recursively for the init part.\nSee git submodule explained for more.With version 1.6.5 of git and later, you can do this automatically by cloning the super-project with the \xe2\x80\x93-recursive option:Update 2016, with git 2.8: see "How to speed up / parallelize downloads of git submodules using git clone --recursive?"You can initiate fetching the submodule using multiple threads, in parallel.\nFor instances:If your submodule was added in a branch be sure to include it in your clone command...Try this:It automatically pulls in the submodule data assuming you have already added the submodules to the parent project.late answerAs I just spent a whole hour fiddling around with a friend: Even if you have Admin rights on BitBucket, always clone the ORIGINAL repository and use the password of the one who owns the repo. Annoying to find out that you ran into this minetrap :PSubmodules parallel fetch aims at reducing the time required to fetch a repositories and all of its related submodules by enabling the fetching of multiple repositories at once. This can be accomplished by using the new --jobs option, e.g.:According to Git team, this can substantially speed up updating repositories that contain many submodules. When using --recurse-submodules without the new --jobs option, Git will fetch submodules one by one.Source: http://www.infoq.com/news/2016/03/git28-released
