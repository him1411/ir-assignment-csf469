Assume I have the following list:What is the simplest way to retrieve an item at random from this list?Use random.choice:For cryptographically secure random choices (e.g. for generating a passphrase from a wordlist), use random.SystemRandom class:In case you also need the index:If you want to randomly select more than one item from a list, or select an item from a set, I\'d recommend using random.sample instead.If you\'re only pulling a single item from a list though, choice is less clunky, as using sample would have the syntax random.sample(some_list, 1)[0] instead of random.choice(some_list).Unfortunately though, choice only works for a single output from sequences (such as lists or tuples).  Though random.choice(tuple(some_set)) may be an option for getting a single item from a set.I propose a script for removing randomly picked up items off a list until it is empty:Maintain a set and remove randomly picked up element (with choice) until list is empty.Three runs give three different answers:As of Python 3.6 you can use the secrets module, which is preferable to the random module for cryptography or security uses.To print a random element from a list:To print a random index:For details, see PEP 506.This is the code with a variable that defines the random index:This is the code without the variable:And this is the code in the shortest and smartest way to do it:(python 2.7)if you need the index just use:random.choice does the same:)We can also do this using randint.Assume I have the following list:What is the simplest way to retrieve an item at random from this list?If you want close to truly random, then I suggest using a SystemRandom object from the random module with the choice method:And now:If you want a deterministic pseudorandom selection, use the choice function (which is actually a bound method on a Random object):It seems random, but it\'s actually not, which we can see if we reseed it repeatedly:I did this to get it to work:I hope that you find this solution helpful.
