Is there a solid way to detect whether or not a user is using a mobile device in jQuery? Something similar to the CSS @media attribute? I would like to run a different script if the browser is on a handheld device.The jQuery $.browser function is not what I am looking for.Instead of using jquery you can use simple javascript to detect it:or you can combine them both to make it more accessible through jQuery...now $.browser will return "device" for all above devicesNote: $.browser removed on jQuery v1.9.1. But u can use this by using jQuery migration plugin CodeA more thorough version:For me small is beautiful so i\'m using this technique:In CSS file:In jQuery/Javascript file:  My objective was to have my site "mobile friendly". So i use CSS Media Queries do show/hide elements depending on the screen size.For example, in my mobile version i don\'t want to activate the Facebook Like Box, because it loads all those profile images and stuff. and that\'s not good for mobile visitors. So, besides hiding the container element, i also do this inside the jQuery code block (above):You can see it in action at http://lisboaautentica.comI\'m still working on the the mobile version, so it\'s still not looking as it should, as of writing this.Update by dekin88There is a JavaScript API built in for detecting media. \nRather than using the above solution simply use the following:Browser Supports : http://caniuse.com/#feat=matchmediaThe advantage to this method is that it\'s not only simpler and shorter, but you can conditionally target different devices such as smartphones and tablets separately if necessary without having to add any dummy elements into the DOM.According to Mozilla - Browser detection using the user agent:In summary, we recommend looking for the string \xe2\x80\x9cMobi\xe2\x80\x9d anywhere in the User Agent to detect a mobile device.Like this:This will match all common mobile browser user agents, including mobile Mozilla, Safari, IE, Opera, Chrome, etc.What you are doing by wanting to detect a mobile device is getting a little too close to a "browser sniffing" concept IMO. It would likely be much better to do some feature detection. Libraries like http://www.modernizr.com/ can help with that.For example, where is the line between mobile and non-mobile? It gets more and more blurry every day.It\'s not jQuery, but I found this: http://detectmobilebrowser.com/It provides scripts to detect mobile browsers in several languages, one of which is javascript.  That may help you with what you\'re looking for.However, since you are using jQuery, you might want to be aware of the jQuery.support collection.  It\'s a collection of properties for detecting the capabilities of the current browser.  Documentation is here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/Since I don\'t know what exactly what you\'re trying to accomplish, I don\'t know which of these will be the most useful.All that being said, I think your best bet is to either redirect or write a different script to the output using a server-side language (if that is an option).  Since you don\'t really know the capabilities of a mobile browser x, doing the detection and alteration logic on the server side would be the most reliable method.  Of course, all of that is a moot point if you can\'t use a server side language :)A simple and effective one-liner:However above code doesn\'t take into account the case for laptops with touchscreen.\nThus, I provide this second version, based on @Julian solution:Sometimes it is desired to know which brand device a client is using in order to show content specific to that device, like a link to the iPhone store or the Android market. Modernizer is great, but only shows you browser capabilities, like HTML5 or Flash.Here is my UserAgent solution in jQuery to display a different class for each device type:This solution is from Graphics Maniacs\nhttp://graphicmaniacs.com/note/detecting-iphone-ipod-ipad-android-and-blackberry-browser-with-javascript-and-php/Found a solution in: http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2011/11/detecting-mobile-devices-with-javascript/.And then to verify if its a Mobile, you can test using: If by "mobile" you mean "small screen," I use this:On iPhone you\'ll end up with a window.screen.width of 320. On Android you\'ll end up with a window.outerWidth of 480 (though that can depend on the Android). iPads and Android tablets will return numbers like 768 so they\'ll get the full view like you\'d want.If you use Modernizr, it is very easy to use Modernizr.touch as mentioned earlier.However, I prefer using a combination of Modernizr.touch and user agent testing, just to be safe.If you don\'t use Modernizr, you can simply replace the Modernizr.touch function above with (\'ontouchstart\' in document.documentElement)Also note that testing the user agent iemobile will give you broader range of detected Microsoft mobile devices than Windows Phone.Also see this SO questionIf you\'re not particularly worried about small displays you could use width/height detection. So that way if width is under a certain size, the mobile site is thrown up. It may not be the perfect way, but it will probably be the easiest to detect for multiple devices. You may need to put in a specific one for the iPhone 4 (large resolution). Here\'s good thing for some languages: http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/You can\'t rely on navigator.userAgent, not every device reveales its real OS. On my HTC for example, it depends on the settings ("using mobile version" on/off). \nOn http://my.clockodo.com, we simply used screen.width to detect small devices. Unfortunately, in some android versions there\'s a bug with screen.width. You can combine this way with the userAgent:I am surprised that no-one pointed out a nice site: http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ It has ready made code in different languages for mobile detection. And if you need to detect the tablets as well, just check About section for additional regex parameter.In one line of javascript:If the user agent contains \'Mobi\' (as per MDN) and ontouchstart is available then it is likely to be a mobile device. I know this question has a lot of answers, but from what i saw nobody approaches the answer the way i would solve this.CSS uses width (Media Queries) to determine which styles applied to the web document baseed on width. Why not use width in the JavaScript?For instance in Bootstrap\'s (Mobile First) Media Queries, there exist 4 snap/break points:We can use this to also solve our JavaScript issue as well.First we will create a function that gets the window size and returns a value that allows us to see what size device is viewing our application:Now that we have the function set up, we can call it ans store the value:Your question was I would like to run a different script if the browser is on a handheld device.Now that we have the device information all that is left is an if statement:here is an example on CodePen: http://codepen.io/jacob-king/pen/jWEeWGHere\'s a function you can use to get a true/false answer as to whether you\'re running on a mobile browser. Yes, it is browser-sniffing, but sometimes that is exactly what you need.Check out this post, it gives a really nice code snippet for what to do when touch devices are detected or what to do if touchstart event is called:I advise you check out http://wurfl.io/In a nutshell, if you import a tiny JS file:you will be left with a JSON object that looks like:(that\'s assuming you are using a Nexus 7, of course) and you will be able to do things like:This is what you are looking for.Disclaimer: I work for the company that offers this free service. Thanks.Great answer thanks. Small improvement to support windows phone and Zune:Use this:Then use this:Simple function based on http://detectmobilebrowser.com/All answers use user-agent to detect the browser but device detection based on user-agent is not very good solution, better is to detect features like touch device (in new jQuery they remove $.browser and use $.support instead).To detect mobile you can check for touch events:Taken from What's the best way to detect a 'touch screen' device using JavaScript?How about mobiledetect.net ?Other solutions seem too basic. This is a lightweight PHP class. It uses the User-Agent string combined with specific HTTP headers to detect the mobile environment. You can also benefit from Mobile Detect by using any of the 3rd party plugins available for: Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, etc.I would be suggesting to use following combo of strings, to check if device type being used.As per Mozilla documentation string Mobi is recommended. But, some of the old tablets doesn\'t return true if only Mobi is used, hence we should use Tablet string too.Similarly, for being on the safe side iPad and iPhone strings could also be used to check the device type.Most of the new devices would return true for Mobi string alone.You can also detect it like bellowTo add an extra layer of control I use the HTML5 storage to detect if it is using mobile storage or desktop storage. If the browser does not support storage I have an array of mobile browser names and I compare the user agent with the browsers in the array.It is pretty simple. Here is the function:User agent strings should not be trusted alone. Solution below will work in all situations.and call this function:You could also use server side script and set javascript variables from it. Example in phpdownload http://code.google.com/p/php-mobile-detect/ and then set javascript variables. This is my code i\'m using in my projects:
