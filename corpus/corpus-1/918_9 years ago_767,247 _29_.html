Using core jQuery, how do you remove all the options of a select box, then add one option and select it?My select box is the following.EDIT: The following code was helpful with chaining. However, (in InternetÂ Explorer) .val(\'whatever\') did not select the option that was added. (I did use the same \'value\' in both .append and .val.)EDIT: Trying to get it to mimic this code, I use the following code whenever the page/form is reset. This select box is populated by a set of radio buttons. .focus() was closer, but the option did not appear selected like it does with .selected= "true". Nothing is wrong with my existing code - I am just trying to learn jQuery.EDIT: selected answer was close to what I needed. This worked for me:But both answers led me to my final solution..why not just use plain javascript?I had a bug in IE7 (works fine in IE6) where using the above jQuery methods would clear the select in the DOM but not on screen. Using the IE Developer Toolbar I could confirm that the select had been cleared and had the new items, but visually the select still showed the old items - even though you could not select them.The fix was to use standard DOM methods/properites (as the poster original had) to clear rather than jQuery - still using jQuery to add options.If your goal is to remove all the options from the select except the first one (typically the \'Please pick an item\' option) you could use:Not sure exactly what you mean by "add one and select it", since it will be selected by default anyway. But, if you were to add more than one, it would make more sense. How about something like:Response to "EDIT": Can you clarify what you mean by "This select box is populated by a set of radio buttons"? A <select> element cannot (legally) contain <input type="radio"> elements.Thanks to the answers I received, I was able to create something like the following, which suits my needs. My question was somewhat ambiguous. Thanks for following up. My final problem was solved by including "selected" in the option that I wanted selected.How about just changing the html to new data.Another example:I\'ve found on the net something like below. With a thousands of options like in my situation this is a lot faster than .empty() or .find().remove() from jQuery.More info here.Building on mauretto\'s answer, this is a little easier to read and understand:To remove all the options except one with a specific value, you can use this:This would be better if the option to be added was already there.This will replace your existing mySelect with a new mySelect.You can do simply by replacing htmlUses the jquery prop() to clear the selected optionFirst clear all exisiting option execpt the first one(--Select--)Append new option values using loop one by oneHope it will workAnother way:Under this link, there are good practices https://api.jquery.com/select/
