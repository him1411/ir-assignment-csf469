What are the correct version numbers for C#? What came out when? Why can\'t I find any answers about C# 3.5?This question is primarily to aid those who are searching for an answer using an incorrect version number, e.g. "C# 3.5". The hope is that anyone failing to find an answer with the wrong version number will find this question and then search again with the right version number.These are the versions of C# known about at the time of this writing:There is no such thing as C# 3.5 - the cause of confusion here is that the C# 3.0 is present in .NET 3.5. The language and framework are versioned independently, however - as is the CLR, which is at version 2.0 for .NET 2.0 through 3.5, .NET 4 introducing CLR 4.0, service packs notwithstanding. The CLR in .NET 4.5 has various improvements, but the versioning is unclear: in some places it may be referred to as CLR 4.5 (this MSDN page used to refer to it that way, for example), but the Environment.Version property still reports 4.0.xxx.More detailed information about the relationship between the language, runtime and framework versions is available on the C# in Depth site. This includes information about which features of C# 3.0 you can use when targeting .NET 2.0. (If anyone wants to bring all of the content into this wiki answer, they\'re welcome to.)As of May 3, 2017, the C# Language Team created a history of C# versions and features on their github repo: Features Added in C# Language VersionsThe biggest problem when dealing with C#\'s version numbers is the fact that it is not tied to a version of the .NET Framework, which it appears to be due to the syncronized releases between Visual Studio and the .NET Framework.The version of C# is actually bound to the compiler, not the framework.  For instance, in VS2008 you can write C# 3.0 and target .NET Framework 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5.  The C# 3.0 nomenclature describes the version of the code syntax and supported features in the same way that ANSI C89, C90, C99 describe the code syntax/features for C.Take a look at Mono, you will see that Mono 2.0 (mostly implemented version 2.0 of the .NET Framework from the ECMA specs) supports the C# 3.0 syntax and features.C# 1.0 with Visual Studio.NETC# 2.0 with Visual Studio 2005C# 3.0 with Visual Studio 2008C# 4.0 with Visual Studio 2010C# 5.0 with Visual Studio 2012C# 6.0 with Visual Studio 2015C# 7.0 with Visual Studio 2017Same as most answers here but tabularized for ease, and added all VS and .NET versions for completeness.VERSION_____LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION______MICROSOFT COMPILERC# 1.0/1.2____December 2001?/2003?___________January 2002?C# 2.0_______September 2005________________November 2005?C# 3.0_______May 2006_____________________November 2006?C# 4.0_______March 2009 (draft)______________April 2010?C# 5.0; released with .NET 4.5 in August 2012C# 6.0; released with .NET  4.6   2015C# 7.0; released with .NET  4.7   2017You can check the latest C# versions here\nC# Version History:C# is a simple & powerful object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.C# has evolved much since its first release in 2002. C# was introduced with .NET Framework 1.0The following table lists important features introduced in each version of C#And the latest version of C# are available here C# VersionsVersion C# 6.0 released with .NET 4.6 and VS2015 (July 2015). Implemented by Roslyn. Features: Comparing the MSDN articles "What\'s New in the C# 2.0 Language and Compiler" and "What\'s New in Visual C# 2005", it is possible to deduce that "C# major_version.minor_version" is coined according to compiler\'s version numbering.  There is C# 1.2 corresponding to .NET  1.1 and VS 2003 and also named as Visual C# .NET 2003 But further on Microsoft stopped to increment minor version (after dot) numbers or to have them other than zero 0.\nThough it should be noted that C# corresponding to .NET 3.5 is named in msdn.microsoft.com as "Visual C# 2008 Service Pack 1" There are 2 parallel naming:  by major .NET/compiler version numbering and by Visual Studio numberingC# 2.0  is synonym for  Visual C# 2005\nC# 3.0  corresponds (or, more correctly, can target) to:  I\'ve summarised most of the versions in this table, the only ones missing should be ASP.NET Core versions. i\'ve also added different versions of MVC.Note that ASP.NET 5 has been rebranded as ASP.NET Core 1.0 and MVC 6 has been rebranded as ASP.NET Core MVC 1.0.0. I believe this change occured sometime around Jan 2016. I have included the release date of ASP.NET 5 RC1 in the table, but I\'ve yet to include ASP.NET core 1.0 and other core versions because i couldn\'t find the exact release dates. You can read more about the release dates regarding ASP.NET Core here: When is ASP.NET Core 1.0 (ASP.NET 5 / vNext) scheduled for release?
