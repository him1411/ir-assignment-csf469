I need to update this table in SQL Server 2005 with data from its \'parent\' table, see below:saleudsale.assid contains the correct value to update ud.assid. What query will do this? I\'m thinking a join but I\'m not sure if it\'s possible.It very much depends on which SQL DBMS you\'re using. Here are some ways to do it in ANSI/ISO (aka should work on any SQL DBMS), MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. Be advised that my suggested ANSI/ISO method will typically be much slower than the other two methods, but if you\'re using a SQL DBMS other than MySQL, SQL Server, or Oracle, then it may be the only way to go (e.g. if your SQL DBMS doesn\'t support MERGE):ANSI/ISO:MySQL:SQL Server:Oracle:This should work in SQL Server:postgresA standard SQL approach would be On SQL Server you can use a joinPostgreSQL:Simplified update query using JOIN-ing multiple tables.Note - first_table, second_table, third_table and some_column like 123456 are demo table names, column names and ids. Replace them with the valid names.Another example why SQL isn\'t really portable.For MySQL it would be:For more info read multiple table update:\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/update.htmlTeradata Aster offers another interesting way how to achieve the goal:I was thinking the SQL-Server one in the top post would work for Sybase since they are both T-SQL but unfortunately not.For Sybase I found the update needs to be on the table itself not the alias:The following statement with FROM keyword is used to update multiple rows with a join And in MS ACCESS:
