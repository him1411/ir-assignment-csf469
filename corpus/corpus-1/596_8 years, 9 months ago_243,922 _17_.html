Is there a command in git to see (either dumped to stdout, or in $PAGER or $EDITOR) a particular version of a particular file?You can use git show:For example, to show the 4th last commit of the file src/main.c, use:Note that the path is from the root of the repository unless it starts with ./ or ../ to indicate a relative path.  For more information, check out the man page for git-show.Doing this by date looks like this:Note that HEAD@{2013-02-25} means "where HEAD was on 2013-02-25" in this repository (using the reflog), not "the last commit before 2013-02-25 in this branch in history".If you like GUIs, you can use gitk:start gitk with:Choose the revision in the top part of the screen, e.g. by description or date. By default, the lower part of the screen shows the diff for that revision, (corresponding to the "patch" radio button).To see the file for the selected revision:You can also specify a commit hash (often also called commit ID) with the git show command.git show <commitHash>:/path/to/fileNote: adding the ./ when specifying a relative path seems important, i.e. git show b2f8be577166577c59b55e11cfff1404baf63a84:./flight-simulation/src/main/components/nav-horiz.html.In addition to Jim Hunziker\'s answer,you can export the file from the revision as,Hope this helps :)git log -p will show you not just the commit logs but also the diff of each commit (except merge commits). Then you can press /, enter filename and press enter. Press n or p to go to the next/previous occurrence. This way you will not just see the changes in the file but also the commit information.
