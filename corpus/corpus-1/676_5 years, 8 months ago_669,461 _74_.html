I\'d like to have my Bootstrap menu automatically drop down on hover, rather than having to click the menu title. I\'d also like to lose the little arrows next to the menu titles.I created a pure on hover dropdown menu based on the latest (v2.0.2) Bootstrap framework that has support for multiple submenus and thought I\'d post it for future users:DemoTo get the menu to automatically drop on hover then this can achieved using basic CSS. You need to work out the selector to the hidden menu option and then set it to display as block when the appropriate li tag is hovered over. Taking the example from the twitter bootstrap page, the selector would be as follows:However, if you are using Bootstrap\'s responsive features, you will not want this functionality on a collapsed navbar (on smaller screens). To avoid this, wrap the code above in a media query:To hide the arrow (caret) this is done in different ways depending on whether you are using Twitter Bootstrap version 2 and lower or version 3:Bootstrap 3To remove the caret in version 3 you just need to remove the HTML <b class="caret"></b> from the .dropdown-toggle anchor element:Bootstrap 2 & lowerTo remove the caret in version 2 you need a little more insight into CSS and I suggest looking at how the :after pseudo element works in more detail. To get you started on your way to understanding, to target and remove the arrows in the twitter bootstrap example, you would use the following CSS selector and code:It will work in your favour if you look further into how these work and not just use the answers that I have given you.Thanks to @CocaAkat for pointing out that we were missing the ">" child combinator to prevent sub menus being shown on the parent hoverIn addition to the answer from "My Head Hurts" (which was great):There are 2 lingering issues:The solution to (1) is removing the "class" and "data-toggle" elements from the nav linkThis also gives you the ability to create a link to your parent page - which wasn\'t possible with the default implementation. You can just replace the "#" with whatever page you want to send the user.The solution to (2) is removing the margin-top on the .dropdown-menu selectorI\'ve used a bit of jQuery:There are a lot of really good solutions here. But I thought that I would go ahead and put mine in here as another alternative. It\'s just a simple jQuery snippet that does it the way bootstrap would if it supported hover for dropdowns instead of just click. I\'ve only tested this with version 3 so I don\'t know if it would work with version 2. Save it as a snippet in your editor and have it at the stroke of a key.Basically, It\'s just saying when you hover on the dropdown class, it will add the open class to it. Then it just works. When you stop hovering on either the parent li with the dropdown class or the child ul/li\'s, it removes the open class. Obviously, this is only one of many solutions, and you can add to it to make it work on only specific instances of .dropdown. Or add a transition to either parent or child.Simply customize your CSS style in three lines of code[Update] The plugin is on GitHub and I am working on some improvements (like use only with data-attributes (no JS necessary). I\'ve leaving the code in below, but it\'s not the same as what\'s on GitHub.I liked the purely CSS version, but it\'s nice to have a delay before it closes, as it\'s usually a better user experience (i.e. not punished for a mouse slip that goes 1 px outside the dropdown, etc), and as mentioned in the comments, there\'s that 1px of margin you have to deal with or sometimes the nav closes unexpectedly when you\'re moving to the dropdown from the original button, etc.I created a quick little plugin that I\'ve used on a couple sites and it\'s worked nicely. Each nav item is independently handled, so they have their own delay timers, etc.JSThe delay parameter is pretty self explanatory, and the instantlyCloseOthers will instantly close all other dropdowns that are open when you hover over a new one.Not pure CSS, but hopefully will help someone else at this late hour (i.e. this is an old thread).If you want, you can see the different processes I went through (in a discussion on the #concrete5 IRC) to get it to work via the different steps in this gist: https://gist.github.com/3876924The plugin pattern approach is much cleaner to support individual timers, etc.See the blog post for more.If you have an element with a dropdown class like this (for example):Then you can have the dropdown menu to be automatically drop down on hover over, rather than having to click its title, by using this snippet of jQuery code:Here is a demoThis answer relied on @Michael answer, I have made some changes and added some additions to get the dropdown menu work properlyThis worked for me:You can use the default $().dropdown(\'toggle\') method to toggle the dropdown menu on hover:Even better with jQuery:Just want to add, that if you have multiple dropdowns (as I do) you should write:And it\'ll work properly.The best way of doing it is to just trigger Bootstrap\'s click event with a hover. This way, it should still remain touch device friendly.In my opinion the best way is like this:Sample markup:I\'ve managed it as follows: I hope this helps someone...Also added margin-top:0 to reset the bootstrap css margin for .dropdown-menu so the menu list dosen\'t dissapear when the user hovers slowly from drop down menu to the menu list.This is probably a stupid idea, but to just remove the arrow pointing down, you can delete theThis does nothing for the up pointing one, though...This will hide the up onesThis should hide the drop downs and their carets if they are smaller than a tablet.I have published a proper plugin for the Bootstrap 3 dropdown hover functionality, in which you can even define what happens when clicking on the dropdown-toggle element (the click can be disabled):https://github.com/istvan-ujjmeszaros/bootstrap-dropdown-hoverI had issues with all the previously existing solutions. The simple CSS ones are not using the .open class on the .dropdown, so there will be no feedback on the dropdown toggle element when the dropdown is visible.The js ones are interfering with clicking on .dropdown-toggle, so the dropdown shows up on hover, then hides it when clicking on an opened dropdown, and moving out the mouse will trigger the dropdown to show up again. Some of the js solutions are braking iOS compatibility, some plugins are not working on modern desktop browsers which are supporting the touch events.That\'s why I made the Bootstrap Dropdown Hover plugin which prevents all these issues by using only the standard Bootstrap javascript API, without any hack. Even the Aria attributes are working fine with this plugin.The jQuery solution is good, but it will need to either deal with on click events (for mobile or tablet) as hover won\'t work properly... Could maybe do some window re-size detection?Andres Ilich\'s answer seems to work well, but it should be wrapped in a media query:Overwrite bootstrap.js with this script.Here\'s my technique that adds a slight delay before the menu is closed after you stop hovering on the menu or the toggle button. The <button> that you would normally click to display the nav menu is #nav_dropdown.To enhance Sudharshan\'s answer, I wrap this in a media query to prevent the hover when on XS display widths...Also the caret in the markup is not required, just the dropdown class for the li.Use this code to open the submenu on mousehover (desktop only):And if you want the first level menu to be clickable, even on mobile add this:The submenu (dropdown-menu) will be opened with mousehover on desktop, and with click/touch on mobile and tablet.\nOnce the submenu was open, a second click will let you open the link.\nThanks to the if ($(window).width() > 767), the submenu will take the full screen width on mobile.This works for WordPress Bootstrap:So you have this code:Normally it works on a click event, and you want it work on a hover event. This is very simple, just use this JavaScript/jQuery code:This works very well and here is the explanation: we have a button, and a menu. When we hover the button we display the menu, and when we mouseout of the button we hide the menu after 100Â ms. If you wonder why I use that, is because you need time to drag the cursor from the button over the menu. When you are on the menu, the time is reset and you can stay there as many time as you want. When you exit the menu, we will hide the menu instantly without any timeout.I\'ve used this code in many projects, if you encounter any problem using it, feel free to ask me questions.For the caret... I haven\'t seen any one specifying simple CSS that totally blocks the caret.Here you go:Here is the JSFiddle -> https://jsfiddle.net/PRkonsult/mn31qf0p/1/The JavaScript bit at the bottom is what does the actual magic.Then the important bit of JavaScript code:
