How can I change a class of an HTML element in response to an onClick event using JavaScript?Modern browsers have added classList which provides methods to make it easier to manipulate classes without needing a library:Unfortunately, these do not work in Internet Explorer prior to v10, though there is a shim to add support for it to IE8 and IE9, available from this page. It is, though, getting more and more supported.The standard JavaScript way to select an element is using document.getElementById("Id"), which is what the following examples use - you can of course obtain elements in other ways, and in the right situation may simply use this instead - however, going into detail on this is beyond the scope of the answer.To replace all existing classes with one or more new classes, set the className attribute:(You can use a space-delimited list to apply multiple classes.)To add a class to an element, without removing/affecting existing values, append a space and the new classname, like so:To remove a single class to an element, without affecting other potential classes, a simple regex replace is required:An explanation of this regex is as follows:The g flag tells the replace to repeat as required, in case the class name has been added multiple times.The same regex used above for removing a class can also be used as a check as to whether a particular class exists:Whilst it is possible to write JavaScript directly inside the HTML event attributes (such as onclick="this.className+=\' MyClass\'") this is not recommended behaviour. Especially on larger applications, more maintainable code is achieved by separating HTML markup from JavaScript interaction logic.The first step to achieving this is by creating a function, and calling the function in the onclick attribute, for example:(It is not required to have this code in script tags, this is simply for brevity of example, and including the JavaScript in a distinct file may be more appropriate.)The second step is to move the onclick event out of the HTML and into JavaScript, for example using addEventListener(Note that the window.onload part is required so that the contents of that function are executed after the HTML has finished loading - without this, the MyElement might not exist when the JavaScript code is called, so that line would fail.)The above code is all in standard JavaScript, however it is common practise to use either a framework or a library to simplify common tasks, as well as benefit from fixed bugs and edge cases that you might not think of when writing your code.Whilst some people consider it overkill to add a ~50Â KB framework for simply changing a class, if you are doing any substantial amount of JavaScript work, or anything that might have unusual cross-browser behaviour, it is well worth considering.(Very roughly, a library is a set of tools designed for a specific task, whilst a framework generally contains multiple libraries and performs a complete set of duties.)The examples above have been reproduced below using jQuery, probably the most commonly used JavaScript library (though there are others worth investigating too).(Note that $ here is the jQuery object.)In addition, jQuery provides a shortcut for adding a class if it doesn\'t apply, or removing a class that does:or, without needing an id:You could also just do:And to toggle a class (remove if exists else add it):In one of my old projects that did not use jQuery, I built the following functions for adding, removing, and checking if element has class:So, for example, if I want onclick to add some class the the button I can use this:By now for sure it would just better to use jQuery.You can use node.className like so:This should work in IE5.5 and up according to PPK.Wow, surprised there are so many overkill answers here...Using pure JavaScript code:This is working for me:As well you could extend HTMLElement object, in order to add methods to add, remove, toggle and check classes (gist):And then just use like this (on click will add or remove class):Here is demo.Just to add on information from another popular framework, Google Closures, see their dom/classes class:One option for selecting the element is using goog.dom.query with a CSS3 selector:A couple of minor notes and tweaks on the previous regexes:You\'ll want to do it globally in case the class list has the class name more than once. And, you\'ll probably want to strip spaces from the ends of the class list and convert multiple spaces to one space to keep from getting runs of spaces. None of these things should be a problem if the only code dinking with the class names uses the regex below and removes a name before adding it. But. Well, who knows who might be dinking with the class name list.This regex is case insensitive so that bugs in class names may show up before the code is used on a browser that doesn\'t care about case in class names.Change an element\'s CSS class with JavaScript in ASP.NET:I would use jQuery and write something like this:This code adds a function to be called when an element of the id some-element is clicked. The function appends clicked to the element\'s class attribute if it\'s not already part of it, and removes it if it\'s there.Yes you do need to add a reference to the jQuery library in your page to use this code, but at least you can feel confident the most functions in the library would work on pretty much all the modern browsers, and it will save you time implementing your own code to do the same.ThanksThe lineshould be:Here\'s my version, fully working:Usage:You may try to use node attributes property to keep compatibility with old browsers even IE6:Here\'s a toggleClass to toggle/add/remove a class on an element:see jsfiddlealso see my answer here for creating a new class dynamicallyI use the following vanilla JavaScript functions in my code. They use regular expressions and indexOf but do not require quoting special characters in regular expressions.You can also use element.classList in modern browsers.It can be done.HTML:CSS:JavaScript:Fiddle.Just thought I\'d throw this in:This is nice one that I found helpful.Working JavaScript code:You can download a working code from this link.After a long search i found the best class management solution without the document.getElementById()The original place of solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8708944/1589669just say myElement.classList="new-class" unless you need to maintain other existing classes in which case you can use the classList.add, .remove methods.OK, I think in this case you should use jQuery or write your own Methods in pure javascript, my preference is adding my own methods rather than injecting all jQuery to my application if I don\'t need that for other reasons.I\'d like to do something like below as methods to my javascript framework to add few functionalities which handle adding classes, deleting classes, etc similar to jQuery, this is fully supported in IE9+, also my code is written in ES6, so you need to make sure your browser support it or you using something like babel, otherwise need to use ES5 syntax in your code, also in this way, we finding element via ID, which means the element needs to have an ID to be selected:and you can simply call use them as below, imagine your element has id of \'id\' and class of \'class\', make sure you pass them as a string, you can use the util as below:Here is simple jQuery code to do that.Here,Good Luck.This is easiest with a library like jQuery:No offense, but it\'s unclever to change class on-the-fly as it forces the CSS interpreter to recalculate the visual presentation of the entire web page.The reason is that it is nearly impossible for the CSS interpreter to know if any inheritance or cascading could be changed, so the short answer is:Never ever change className on-the-fly !-)But usually you\'ll only need to change a property or two, and that is easily implemented:
