I\'ve encountered an error deploying a site to a server.  When trying to load the home page, or access authentication on the new site in IIS, I get the error:Config Error: This configuration section cannot be used at this path.\n  This happens when the section is locked at a parent level. Locking is\n  either by default (overrideModeDefault="Deny"), or set explicitly by a\n  location tag with overrideMode="Deny" or the legacy\n  allowOverride="false".More detail can be found here, in Scenario 7 matches my hex error code.The solution given on the linked site above is to set Allow for overrideModeDefault in the section mentioned in my error, in the applicationHost.config file.  In my case,  under Security in system.webServer.  But if I look at the applicationHost.config on my local computer, where the site is properly deployed already, that section is set to Deny.If this solution is correct, how is my local instance running just fine with the same web.config?  According to my applicationHost.config, that section should be locked, but it\'s not.  I\'d prefer to not change the applicationHost.config file, because there are many other sites running on that server.  Is there another solution?I had the same problem. Don\'t remember where I found it on the web, but here is what I did:btw, I\'m using Windows 7.You could also use the IIS Manager to edit those settings.Care of this Learn IIS article:Using the Feature Delegation from the root of IIS:You can then control each of machine-level read/write permissions, which will otherwise give you the overrideMode="Deny" errors.For Windows Server 2012 and IIS 8, the procedure is similar.The Web Server (IIS) and Application Server should be installed, and you should also have the optional Web Server (IIS) Support under Application Server.Browse to \xe2\x80\x9cC:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\config\xe2\x80\x9d (you will need administrator rights here)\nOpen applicationHost.configNote: In IISExpress and Visual Studio 2015 the applicationHost.config is stored in $(solutionDir).vs\\config\\applicationhost.config Find the section that showed up in the \xe2\x80\x9cconfig source\xe2\x80\x9d part of the error message page.  For me this has typically been \xe2\x80\x9cmodules\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chandlers\xe2\x80\x9dChange the overrideModeDefault attribute to be \xe2\x80\x9cAllow\xe2\x80\x9dSo the whole line now looks like:After saving the file, the page loaded up fine in my browser.Warning:\nEditing applicationHost.config on 64-bit WindowsYou need to unlock handlers. This can be done using following cmd command:Maybe another info for people that are getting this error on IIS 8, in my case was on Microsoft Server 2012 platform. I had spend couple of hours battling with other errors that bubbled up after executing appcmd. In the end I was able to fix it by removing Web Server Role and installing it again. As per my answer to this similar issue;Try unlocking the relevant IIS configuration settings at server level, as follows:I needed to run these two commands from and elevated command prompt:On Windows Server 2012 with IIS 8 I have solved this by enabling ASP.NET 4.5 feature:and then following ken\'s answer.The best option is to Change Application Settings from the Custom Site Delegation\nOpen IIS and from the root select Feature Delegation and then select Application Settings and from the right sidebar select Read/Write\n\nIn my case it was that on server was not enabled "HTTP Activation" under .NET Framework Features. So for Windows Server 2012 the solution which worked for me was:Server Manager -> Add roles and features -> Features -> make sure that under .NET Framework  of version you want to use is checked "HTTP Activation"Seems that with IIS Express and VS 2015, there\'s a copy of the applicationHost.config file at $(solutionDir).vs\\config\\applicationhost.config so you\'ll need to make changes there.  See this link: http://digitaldrummerj.me/iis-express-windows-authentication/Make sure these lines are changed per below:For Win 10 (Probably will work on other windows versions as well.)1. Open "Turn windows features on or off" by: WinKey+ R => "optionalfeatures" => OKThe Powershell way of enabling the features (Windows Server 2012 +) - trim as needed:To fix this open up the IIS Express applicationhost.config. This file is stored at C:\\Users[your user name]\\Documents\\IISExpress\\config\\applicationhost.configUpdate for VS2015+: config file location is $(solutionDir).vs\\config\\applicationhost.configLook for the following linesChange those lines toSave it and refresh Asp.net Page.In my case, I got this error because I was operating on the wrong configuration file.I was doing this:instead of the correct code:in other words, I was trying to operate on the website\'s web.config instead of the global file C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\config\\applicationHost.config, which has a section (or can have a section) for the website.  The setting I was trying to change exists only in the applicationHost.config file.In our case on IIS 8 we found the error was produced when attempting to view Authentication" for a site, when:Marking the site Feature Delegation "Authentication - Windows" = "Read/Write", the error went away.  It appears that, with the feature marked "Read Only", the web.config is not allowed to reference it at all even to disable it, as this apparently constitutes a write.\nI needed to change the SSL settings on a subfolder when i got this nice message. In my case following action helped me out.Opened C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\config\\applicationHost.configAnd changed the value from overrideModeDefault="Deny" to "Allow"This Did the trick for me, for IIS 8 Windows server 2012 R2 Go to "Turn on Features"Then go to all default setting , Next, Next, Next etc.. Then, select as shown below,\nThen reset IIS (optional) but do it safer side. This is an additional solution as its a generic problem everyone have different of problem and thus different solution. Cheers!For Windows Server 2008 and IIS 7, the procedure is similar. \nplease refer to this:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb763178(v=vs.100).aspxin add role service, u will see "Application Development Features"Check (enable) the features. I checked all.Norwegian google ref:  Denne konfigurasjonsdelen kan ikke brukes i denne banen. Dette skjer n\xc3\xa5r delen er l\xc3\xa5st p\xc3\xa5 et overordnet niv\xc3\xa5. L\xc3\xa5sing skjer som standard (overrideModeDefault="Deny") eller angis eksplisitt av en stedskode med overrideMode="Deny" eller den eldre allowOverride="false".Turning on all Application development options fixed this for me. I probably don\'t need all, but now it works.Received this same issue after installing IIS 7 on Vista Home Premium.  To correct error I changed the following values located in the applicationHost.config file located in Windows\\system32\\inetsrv.Change all of the following values located in section  --> Can You try this:Go to application path where you\'re getting deny error, right click Properties->Security tabIn that, change the permissions and check the checkbox read and write. Then it will work without any error hopefully.I had the same issue. This worked for me\nAlso in IIS 8 you can solve this problem by changing the server to IIS Express. Goto debug->Properties \nIn the Web select the server as IIS Express from the dropdown and then rebuild the solutionTo make a change at Application Level (Web.Config):Please remove the Trust Level from the web.config:\nActually I was getting this error when I was trying to host my Website on the Hosting Server where I don\'t have control on their Server. Removing the above line from my Application web.config solved my issue.I had an issue where I was putting in the override = "Allow" values (mentioned here already)......but on a x64 bit system.......my 32 notepad++ was phantom saving them.  Switching to Notepad (which is a 64bit application on a x64 bit O/S) allowed me to save the settings.See :http://dpotter.net/technical/2009/11/editing-applicationhostconfig-on-64-bit-windows/The relevant text:One of the problems I\xe2\x80\x99m running down required that I view and possibly edit applicationHost.config.  This file is located at %SystemRoot%\\System32\\inetsrv\\config.  Seems simple enough.  I was able to find it from the command line easily, but when I went to load it in my favorite editor (Notepad++) I got a file not found error.  Turns out that the System32 folder is redirected for 32-bit applications to SysWOW64.  There appears to be no way to view the System32 folder using a 32-bit app.  Go figure.\nFortunately, 64-bit versions of Windows ship with a 64-bit version of Notepad.  As much as I dislike it, at least it works.In my case I was getting this error when attempting to update the authentication settings in IIS also in addition to browsing.  I was able to remove this error by removing the authentication setting from the web.config itself.  Removing a problematic configuration section may be less invasive and preferable in some cases than changing the server roles and features too much:Section Removed:The following worked for me:Go to project properties.  Web tab.  Set to Local IIS and set specific page.I have Windows 7 and Visual Studio 2013.i solved this issue go to cmd and execute  aspnet_regiis -ihope it helpful to someone.In my case, it was something else.When I loaded the solution in a new version of Visual Studio, VS apparently created a new project-specific applicationhost.config file:MySolutionDir\\.vs\\config\\applicationhost.configIt started using the settings from the new config, instead of my already customized global IIS Express settings.\n(\\Users\\%USER%\\Documents\\IISExpress\\config\\applicationhost.config)In my case this was the setting that needed to be set. Of course it could be something else for you:
