Does JavaScript have any built-in functionality that does this?The complexity of my method is O(n) and it would be really interesting to see better implementations.Use unshift. It\'s like push, except it adds elements to the beginning of the array instead of the end.A simple diagram...and chart:Check out the MDN Array documentation. Virtually every language that has the ability to push/pop elements from an array will also have the ability to unshift/shift (sometimes called push_front/pop_front) elements, you should never have to implement these yourself.Quick Cheatsheet: The terms shift/unshift and push/pop can be a bit confusing, at least to folks who may not be familiar with programming in C.If you are not familiar with the lingo, here is a quick translation of alternate terms, which may be easier to remember:Another way to do that through concatThe difference between concat and unshift is that concat returns a new array. The performance between them could be found here.    Here is the test resultyou have an array:  var arr = [23, 45, 12, 67];To add an item to the beginning, you want to use splice:
