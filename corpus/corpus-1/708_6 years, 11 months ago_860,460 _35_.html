How can I find all the files in a directory having the extension .txt in python?You can use glob:or simply os.listdir:or if you want to traverse directory, use os.walk:Use glob.Something like that should do the jobSomething like this will work: I like os.walk():Or with generators:Here\'s more versions of the same that produce slightly different results:path.py is another alternative: https://github.com/jaraco/path.pyThis code makes my life simpler.Python has all tools to do this: You can try this codeUse fnmatch: https://docs.python.org/2/library/fnmatch.htmlFor me. It\'s classic.You can simply use pathlibs glob 1:or in a loop:If you want it recursive you can use .glob(\'**/*.txt)1The pathlib module was included in the standard library in python 3.4. But you can install back-ports of that module even on older Python versions (i.e. using conda or pip): pathlib and pathlib2.Functional solution with sub-directories:In case the folder contains a lot of files or memory is an constraint, consider using generators:Option A: IterateOption B: Get allI suggest you to use fnmatch and the upper method. In this way you can find any of the following:.To get an array of ".txt" file names from a folder called "data" in the same directory I usually use this simple line of code:You can try this code:use Python OS module to find files with specific extension.the simple example is here :Try this this will find all your file inside folder or folder    A copy-pastable solution similar to the one of ghostdog:Many users have replied with os.walk answers, which includes all files but also all directories and subdirectories and their files.Or for a one off where you don\'t need a generator:If you are going to use matches for something else, you may want to make it a list rather than a generator expression:
