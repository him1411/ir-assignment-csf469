Are there any shortcuts to (stringByAppendingString:) string concatenation in Objective-C, or shortcuts for working with NSString in general?For example, I\'d like to make:something more like:Two answers I can think of... neither is particularly as pleasant as just having a concatenation operator.First, use an NSMutableString, which has an appendString method, removing some of the need for extra temp strings.Second, use an NSArray to concatenate via the componentsJoinedByString method.I\'m guessing you\'re not happy with multiple appends (a+b+c+d), in which case you could do:using something likeIf you have 2 NSString literals, you can also just do this:That\'s also useful for joining #defines:Enjoy. I keep returning to this post and always end up sorting through the answers to find this simple solution that works with as many variables as needed:For example:Well, as colon is kind of special symbol, but is part of method signature, it is possible to exted the NSString with category to add this non-idiomatic style of string concatenation:You can define as many colon separated arguments as you find useful... ;-)For a good measure, I\'ve also added concat: with variable arguments that takes nil terminated list of strings. create a method......Then, in whatever function you need it in, set your string or textfield or whatever to the return value of this function.Or what you can do to make a shortcut is convert the NSString into a c++ string and use the \'+\' there.Hope this helps!!!!!Use this way:ORWhen building requests for web services, I find doing something like the following is very easy and makes concatenation readable in Xcode:Macro:Test Cases:Alternate macro: (if you wanted to enforce a minimum number of arguments)Shortcut by creating AppendString (AS) macro ...Note:If using a macro, of course just do it with variadic arguments, see EthanB\'s answer below.Here\'s a simple way, using the new array literal syntax:The only way to make c = [a stringByAppendingString: b] any shorter is to use autocomplete at around the st point. The + operator is part of C, which doesn\'t know about Objective-C objects.After a couple of years now with Objective C I think this is the best way to work with Objective C to achieve what you are trying to achieve.Start keying in "N" in your Xcode application and it autocompletes to "NSString".\nkey in "str" and it autocompletes to "stringByAppendingString". So the keystrokes are quite limited.Once you get the hang of hitting the "@" key and tabbing the process of writing readable code no longer becomes a problem. It is just a matter of adapting.How about shortening stringByAppendingString and use a #define:Thus you would use:Problem is that it only works for two strings, you\'re required to wrap additional brackets for more appends:Was trying the following in the lldb pane which errors.instead use alloc and initWithFormat method:I tried this code. it\'s worked for me.This is for better logging, and logging only - based on dicius excellent multiple argument method. I define a Logger class, and call it like so:Almost good, except having to end the var args with "nil" but I suppose there\'s no way around that in Objective-C.Logger.hLogger.mIn order to only concat strings, I\'d define a Category on NSString and add a static (+) concatenate method to it that looks exactly like the log method above except it returns the string. It\'s on NSString because it\'s a string method, and it\'s static because you want to create a new string from 1-N strings, not call it on any one of the strings that are part of the append. Try stringWithFormat:When dealing with strings often I find it easier to make the source file ObjC++, then I can concatenate std::strings using the second method shown in the question.My preferred method is this:You can achieve it by adding the join method to NSArray with a category:@[] it\'s the short definition for NSArray, I think this is the fastest method to concatenate strings.If you don\'t want to use the category, use directly the componentsJoinedByString: method:You can use NSArray asoryou can use Either of these formats work in XCode7 when I tested:For some reason, you only need the @ operator character on the first string of the mix.However, it doesn\'t work with variable insertion. For that, you can use this extremely simple solution with the exception of using a macro on "cat" instead of "and".In Swift Also, you can use += operator for the same as below...Let\'s imagine that u don\'t know how many strings there.For all Objective C lovers that need this in a UI-Test:
