Is there a way to generate a random number in a specified range (e.g. from 1 to 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) in JavaScript?If you wanted to get between 1 and 6, you would calculate:Where:  What it does "extra" is it allows random intervals that do not start with 1.\nSo you can get a random number from 10 to 15 for example. Flexibility.From the Mozilla Developer Network documentation:Useful examples:Other solutions:Or, in UnderscoreMath is not my strong point, but I\'ve been working on a project where I needed to generate a lot of random numbers between both positive and negative.  E.g  Of course, you can also add some validation to make sure you don\'t do this with anything other than numbers. Also make sure that min is always less than or equal to max.jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/cyGwf/477/Random Integer: to get a random integer between min and max, use the following codeRandom Floating Point Number: to get a random floating point number between min and max, use the following codeReference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/randomMath.random() would always give between 0 and 1. Logic is to reduce the max randomly from 0 to max-minmax - 0 * (max-min) = maxmax - 1 * (max-min) = minmax - r * (max-min) = X, where X has range of min < X < maxgenerateRandomInteger(100, 200);The solution works for use-cases as below. I am listing them in detail as the accepted answer and other solutions failed in some of them.I wrote more flexible function which can give you random number but not only integer.Fixed version.I was searching random number generator written in TypeScript and I have written this after reading all of the answers, hope It would work for TypeScript coders.ExampleReturn a random number between 1 and 10:The result could be:\n    3Try yourself: here--or using lodash / undescore:_.random(min, max)Docs:\n- lodash\n- undescoreInspite of many answers and almost same result. I would like to add my answer and explain its working. Because it is important to understand its working rather than copy pasting one line code. Generating random numbers is nothing but simple maths. CODE:Sense you need to add 1 to the max number, and then subtract the minimum number for any of this to work, and I need to make a lot of random Integers, this function works.This works with both negative, and positive numbers, and I\'m working on decimals for a library.Instead of Math.random(), you can use crypto.getRandomValues() to generate evenly-distributed cryptographically-secure random numbers. Here\'s an example:This solution is to display random number from 0 to 1.if we use this we can get result like 0.6353540565013625I found Francisc\'s solution above did not include the min or max number in the results, so I altered it like this:
