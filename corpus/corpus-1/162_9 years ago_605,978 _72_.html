How can I check the existence of an element in jQuery?The current code that I have is this:Is there is a more elegant way to approach this? Perhaps a plugin or a function?In JavaScript, everything is \'truthy\' or \'falsy\', and for numbers 0 (and NaN) means false, everything else true. So you could write:You don\'t need that >0 part.Yes!This is in response to: Herding Code podcast with Jeff AtwoodIf you usedyou would imply that chaining was possible when it is not.This would be better:Alternatively, from the FAQ:You could also use the following. If there are no values in the jQuery object array then getting the first item in the array would return undefined.You can use this:The fastest and most semantically self explaining way to check for existence is actually by using plain JavaScript:It is a bit longer to write than the jQuery length alternative, but executes faster since it is a native JS method.And it is better than the alternative of writing your own jQuery function. That alternative is slower, for the reasons @snover stated. But it would also give other programmers the impression that the exists() function is something inherent to jQuery. JavaScript would/should be understood by others editing your code, without increased knowledge debt.NB: Notice the lack of an \'#\' before the element_id (since this is plain JS, not jQuery).You can save a few bytes by writing:This works because each jQuery object also masquerades as an array, so we can use the array dereferencing operator to get the first item from the array. It returns undefined if there is no item at the specified index.You can use:A little more elegant, perhaps.This plugin can be used in an if statement like if ($(ele).exist()) { /* DO WORK */ } or using a callback.jsFiddleYou may specify one or two callbacks. The first one will fire if the element exists, the second one will fire if the element does not exist. However, if you choose to pass only one function, it will only fire when the element exists. Thus, the chain will die if the selected element does not exist. Of course, if it does exist, the first function will fire and the chain will continue.Keep in mind that using the callback variant helps maintain chainability \xe2\x80\x93 the element is returned and you can continue chaining commands as with any other jQuery method!There\'s no need for jQuery really. With plain JavaScript it\'s easier and semantically correct to check for:If for any reason you don\'t want to put an id to the element, you can still use any other JavaScript method designed to access the DOM.jQuery is really cool, but don\'t let pure JavaScript fall into oblivion...The reason all of the previous answers require the .length parameter is that they are mostly using jquery\'s $() selector which has querySelectorAll behind the curtains (or they are using it directly).  This method is rather slow because it needs to parse the entire DOM tree looking for all matches to that selector and populating an array with them.The [\'length\'] parameter is not needed or useful and the code will be a lot faster if you directly use document.querySelector(selector) instead, because it returns the first element it matches or null if not found.However this method leaves us with the actual object being returned; which is fine if it isn\'t going to be saved as variable and used repeatedly (thus keeping the reference around if we forget).In some cases this may be desired.  It can be used in a for loop like this:If you don\'t actually need the element and want to get/store just a true/false, just double not it !!  It works for shoes that come untied, so why knot here?You could use this:I have found if ($(selector).length) {} to be insufficient. It will silently break your app when selector is an empty object {}.My only suggestion is to perform an additional check for {}.I\'m still looking for a better solution though as this one is a bit heavy.Edit: WARNING! This doesn\'t work in IE when selector is a string.Is $.contains() what you want?jQuery.contains( container, contained )The $.contains() method returns true if the DOM element provided by the second argument is a descendant of the DOM element provided by the first argument, whether it is a direct child or nested more deeply. Otherwise, it returns false. Only element nodes are supported; if the second argument is a text or comment node, $.contains() will return false.Note: The first argument must be a DOM element, not a jQuery object or plain JavaScript object.You can check element is present or not using length in java script.\n   If length is greater than zero then element is present if length is zero then\n   element is not present   this is very similar to all of the answers, but why not use the ! operator twice so you can get a boolean:Try testing for DOM elementInspired by hiway\'s answer I came up with the following:jQuery.contains takes two DOM elements and checks whether the first one contains the second one.Using document.documentElement as the first argument fulfills the semantics of the exists method when we want to apply it solely to check the existence of an element in the current document.Below, I\'ve put together a snippet that compares jQuery.exists() against the $(sel)[0] and $(sel).length approaches which both return truthy values for $(4) while $(4).exists() returns false. In the context of checking for existence of an element in the DOM this seems to be the desired result.I had a case where I wanted to see if an object exists inside of another so I added something to the first answer to check for a selector inside the selector..How about:It\'s very minimal and saves you having to enclose the selector with $() every time.I stumbled upon this question and i\'d like to share a snippet of code i currently use:And now i can write code like this - It might seem a lot of code, but when written in CoffeeScript it is quite small:I just like to use plain vanilla javascript to do this.I see most of the answers here are not accurate as they should be, they check element length, it can be correct in many cases, but not 100%, imagine if number pass to the function instead, so I prototype a function which check all conditions and return the answer as it should be:This will check both length and type, Now you can check it this way:I\'m using this:Execute the chain only if a jQuery element exist  - http://jsfiddle.net/andres_314/vbNM3/2/No need for jQueryChecking for existence of an element is documented neatly in the official jQuery website itself!Use the .length property of the jQuery collection returned by your\n  selector:Note that it isn\'t always necessary to test whether an element exists.\n  The following code will show the element if it exists, and do nothing\n  (with no errors) if it does not:size() counts the number of elements returned by the selectorHere is my favorite exist method in jQueryand other version which supports callback when selector does not existExample:$("selector") give an object which has length data. If there are elements as you define in selector, you will get them from the object. So if you check it\'s length you allready can find, is there any element exists. In javascript 0 == false also null == false . If you not get 0 your codes will run.Here is the complete example of different situations and way to check if element exists using direct if on jQuery selector may or may not work because it returns array or elements.FINAL SOLUTION
