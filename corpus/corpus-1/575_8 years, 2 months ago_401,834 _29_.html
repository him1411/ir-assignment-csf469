What is the easiest way to convert the result of Throwable.getStackTrace() to a string that depicts the stacktrace?One can use the following method to convert an Exception stack trace to String. This class is available in Apache commons-lang which is most common dependent library with many popular open sourcesorg.apache.commons.lang.exception.ExceptionUtils.getStackTrace(Throwable)Use Throwable.printStackTrace(PrintWriter pw) to send the stack trace to an appropriate writer.This should work:   If you are developing for Android, a far easier way is to use this:The format is the same as getStacktrace, for e.g.WARNING: Does not include cause (which is usually the useful bit!)If you have the actual Throwable instance, Google Guava provides Throwables.getStackTraceAsString().Example:For me the cleanest and easiest way was:Inspired by @Brian Agnew:The following code allows you to get the entire stackTrace with a String format, without using APIs like log4J or even java.util.Logger:Here is a version that is copy-pastable directly into code:Or, in a catch blockPrinting stack trace to stringIt\'s useful when you want to print the current thread stack trace without creating instance of Throwable - but note that creating new Throwable and getting stack trace from there is actually  faster and cheaper than calling Thread.getStackTrace.Without java.io.* it can be done like this.And then the trace variable holds your stack trace. Output also holds the initial cause, the output is identical to printStackTrace()Example, printStackTrace() yields:The trace String holds, when printed to stdoutCode from Apache Commons Lang 3.4 (JavaDoc):The difference with the other answers is that it uses autoFlush on the PrintWriter.Extending the Throwable class will give you the String property error.stackTraceString:The clever sniping in the first set of comments was very amusing, but it really depends on what you are trying to do. \nIf you don\'t already have the correct library, then 3 lines of code (as in D. Wroblewski\'s answer) is perfect.\nOTOH, if you already have the apache.commons library (as most large projects will), then Amar\'s answer is shorter.\nOK, it might take you ten minutes to get the library and install it correctly (less than one if you know what you\'re doing). But the clock is ticking, so you may not have the time to spare.\nJarek Przyg\xc3\xb3dzki had an interesting caveat--"If you don\'t need nested exceptions".But what if I do need the full stack traces, nested and all?  In that case, the secret is to use apache.common\'s getFullStackTrace (see http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-2.6/org/apache/commons/lang/exception/ExceptionUtils.html#getFullStackTrace%28java.lang.Throwable%29)It saved my bacon. Thanks, Amar, for the hint!an exapansion on Gala\'s answer that will also include the causes for the exception:If you don\'t want to use an external library and you\'re not developing for Android, you could create an \'extension\' method like this:
