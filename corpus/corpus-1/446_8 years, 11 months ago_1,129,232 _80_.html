I would like to format a price in JavaScript.\nI\'d like a function which takes a float as an argument and returns a string formatted like this:What\'s the best way to do this?You can use:Then you can add the sign of \'$\'.If you require \',\' for thousand you can use:And use it with:If you\'re always going to use \'.\' and \',\', you can leave them off your method call, and the method will default them for you.If your culture has the two symbols flipped (i.e. Europeans), just paste over the following two lines in the formatMoney method:TESTS:DEMO: http://jsfiddle.net/hAfMM/You can also extend the prototype of Number object to add additional support of any number of decimals [0 .. n] and the size of number groups [0 .. x]:DEMO / TESTS: http://jsfiddle.net/hAfMM/435/In this super extended version you may set different delimiter types:DEMO / TESTS: http://jsfiddle.net/hAfMM/612/Javascript has a number formatter, and it\'s part of the Internationalization API.JS fiddleA final note comparing this to the older .toLocaleString. They both offer essentially the same functionality. However, toLocaleString in its older incarnations (pre-Intl) does not actually support locales: it uses the system locale. Therefore, to be sure that you\'re using the correct version, MDN suggests to check for the existence of Intl. So if you need to check for Intl anyway, why not use it instead?\nHowever, if you choose to use the shim, that also patches toLocaleString, so in that case you can use it without any hassle:Below is the Patrick Desjardins (alias Daok) code with a bit of comments added and some minor changes:and here some tests:The minor changes are:moved a bit the Math.abs(decimals) to be done only when is not NaN.decimal_sep can not be empty string anymore (a some sort of decimal separator is a MUST)we use typeof thousands_sep === \'undefined\' as suggested in How best to determine if an argument is not sent to the JavaScript function(+n || 0) is not needed because this is a Number objectTake a look at the JavaScript Number object and see if it can help you.To use these at the same time the value must have its type changed back to a number because they both output a string. Example:accounting.js is a tiny JavaScript library for number, money and currency formatting.http://openexchangerates.github.io/accounting.js/Here\'s the best js money formatter I\'ve seen:It was re-formatted and borrowed from here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/149099/751484You\'ll have to supply your own currency designator (you used $ above).Call it like this (although note that the args default to 2, comma, & period, so you don\'t need to supply any args if that\'s your preference):I think what you want is f.nettotal.value = "$" + showValue.toFixed(2);If amount is a number, say -123, thenwill produce the string "-$123.00".Here\'s a complete working example.There are already some great answers here. Here\'s another attempt, just for fun:And some tests:Edited: now it will handle negative numbers as wellSo why hasn\'t anyone suggested the following? Works for most/some browsers:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString#Browser_CompatibilityOk, based on what you said, i\'m using this:I\'m open to improvement suggestions (i\'d prefer not to include YUI just to do this :-) )\nI already know I should be detecting the "." instead of just using it as the decimal separator...I use the library Globalize (from Microsoft): https://github.com/jquery/globalizeIt\'s a great project to localize numbers, currencies and dates and to have them automatically formatted the right way according to the user locale! ...and despite it should be a jQuery extension, it\'s currently a 100% independent library. I suggest you all to try it out! :)javascript-number-formatter (formerly at Google Code)(excerpt from its README)+1 to Jonathan M for providing the original method. Since this is explicitly a currency formatter, I went ahead and added the currency symbol (defaults to \'$\') to the output, and added a default comma as the thousands separator. If you don\'t actually want a currency symbol (or thousands separator), just use "" (empty string) as your argument for it.A shorter method (for inserting space, comma or point) with regular expression ?Numeral.js - a js library for easy number formatting by @adamwdraperThere is a javascript port of the PHP function "number_format".I find it very usefull as it is easy to use and recognisable for PHP developers.(Comment block from the original, included below for examples & credit where due)Patrick Desjardins\' answer looks good, but I prefer my javascript simple.  Here\'s a function I just wrote to take a number in and return it in currency format (minus the dollar sign)There is a built-in function toFixed in javascript I suggest the NumberFormat class from Google Visualization API.You can do something like this:I hope it helps.From WillMaster.The main part is inserting the thousand-separators, that could be done like this:This might be a little late, but here\'s a method I just worked up for a coworker to add a locale-aware .toCurrencyString() function to all numbers.  The internalization is for number grouping only, NOT the currency sign - if you\'re outputting dollars, use "$" as supplied, because $123 4567 in Japan or China is the same number of USD as $1,234,567 is here in the US.  If you\'re outputting euro/etc., then change the currency sign from "$".Declare this anywhere in your HEAD or wherever necessary, just before you need to use it:Then you\'re done!  Use (number).toCurrencyString() anywhere you need to output the number as currency.As usually, there are multiple ways of doing the same thing but I would avoid using Number.prototype.toLocaleString since it can return different values based on the user settings.I also don\'t recommend extending the Number.prototype - extending native objects prototypes is a bad practice since it can cause conflicts with other people code (e.g. libraries/frameworks/plugins) and may not be compatible with future JavaScript implementations/versions.I believe that Regular Expressions are the best approach for the problem, here is my implementation:edited on 2010/08/30: added option to set number of decimal digits.\nedited on 2011/08/23: added option to set number of decimal digits to zero.Here are some solutions, all pass the test suite, test suite and benchmark included, if you want copy and paste to test, try This Gist.Base on https://stackoverflow.com/a/14428340/1877620, but fix if there is no decimal point.If we want custom thousands separator or decimal separator, use replace():A simple option for proper comma placement by reversing the string first and basic regexp.Haven\'t seen this one. It\'s pretty concise and easy to understand.Here is a version with more options in the final output to allow formatting different currencies in different locality formats.Patrick Desjardins (ex Daok)\'s example worked well for me. I ported over to coffeescript if anyone is interested.I found this from: accounting.js . Its very easy and perfectly fits my need.
