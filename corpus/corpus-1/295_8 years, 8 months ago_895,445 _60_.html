How do I center the text horizontally and vertically in a TextView in Android, so that it appears exactly in the middle of the TextView?I\'m assuming you\'re using XML layout.and as @stealthcopter commented \nin java: .setGravity(Gravity.CENTER);This will do the trickYou can also set it up dynamically using:This works when used with a RelativeLayout where the layout\'s height & width are set to wrap_content.You can also use the combination:Then, if textview width is more than "fill_parent" the text will still be aligned to left (not centered as with gravity set only to "center").Apply gravity:      For vertical:      In XML:If you are using TableLayout make sure to set the gravity of the TableRows to center, too.\nOtherwise it will not work. At least it didn\'t work with me until I set the gravity of the TableRow to center.For example, like this:You need to set TextView Gravity (Center Horizontal & Center Vertical) like this:and        And dynamically using:In my opinion, is better than, which is better than,at least for formatting text.There are two ways of doing this.The first in the XML code. You need to pay attention at the Gravity Attribute. You also can find this attribute in the Graphic Editor; it may be easier than the XML EDITOR.For your specific scenario, the values of gravity will be: In the graphical editor you will find all the possible values, even see their results.For Linear Layout:\nIn XML use something like thisTo do this at run time use something like this in your activityFor Relative Layout: in XML use some thing like thisTo do this at run time use something like this in your activityUse in the XML file.Layout fileor:Use this inside the Java classUse this  for relative layout and for other layout While using gravity works for TextView, there\'s an alternate method implemented in API level 17 - Don\'t know the difference, but it works too. However only for API level 17 or higher.In RelativeLayout, it will be nice with it.And another Button and anything else you can add.The following works nicely for me.Easiest way (which is surprisingly only mentioned in comments, hence why I am posting as an answer) is:You can just set the gravity of your textview into CENTER.If you are trying to center text on a TableRow in a TableLayout, here is how I achieved this:Here is my answer that I had used in my app. It shows text in center of the screen.If you are using Relative Layout:If you are using LinearLayoutIf the TextView\'s height and width are wrap content then the text within the TextView always be centered. But if the TextView\'s width is match_parent and height is match_parent or wrap_content then you have to write the below code: For RelativeLayout:For LinearLayout:As many answers suggest above works fine.If you want to center it just vertically:or just horizontally:Simply, in your XML file, set the textview gravity to center:The TextView\'s height and width are wrap content then the text within the textview always be centered, then make center in its parent layout by using:For LinearLayout also the code is same :and pro-grammatically parent is RelativeLayout java code this at run time use something like this in your activityYou can do like this to get text centered   android:gravity="center_horizontal" for align text Center horizontally.\nandroid:gravity="center_vertical" for align text Center vertically.\nandroid:gravity="center" for align text Center both vertically and horizontally.Try this way, it will workuse the below code in xml it worked for me you can change the orientation it will be in the centreDid you try this way?
