I\'d like to do something like this to tick a checkbox using jQuery:or Does such a thing exist?Use the new .prop() method:The .prop() method is not available, so you need to use .attr().Note that this is the approach used by jQuery\'s unit tests prior to version 1.6 and is preferable to usingsince the latter will, if the box was initially checked, change the behaviour of a call to .reset() on any form that contains it - a subtle but probably unwelcome behaviour change.For more context, some incomplete discussion of the changes to the handling of the checked attribute/property in the transition from 1.5.x to 1.6 can be found in the version 1.6 release notes and the Attributes vs. Properties section of the .prop() documentation.If you\'re working with just one element, you can always just modify the HTMLInputElement\'s .checked property:The benefit to using the .prop() and .attr() methods instead of this is that they will operate on all matched elements.Use:And if you want to check if a checkbox is checked or not:This is the correct way of checking and unchecking checkboxes with jQuery, as it is cross-platform standard, and will allow form reposts.By doing this, you are using JavaScript standards for checking and unchecking checkboxes, so any browser that properly implements the "checked" property of the checkbox element will run this code flawlessly. This should be all major browsers, but I am unable to test previous to Internet Explorer 9.The Problem (jQuery 1.6):Once a user clicks on a checkbox, that checkbox stops responding to the "checked" attribute changes.Here is an example of the checkbox attribute failing to do the job after someone has clicked the checkbox (this happens in Chrome).FiddleThe Solution:By using JavaScript\'s "checked" property on the DOM elements, we are able to solve the problem directly, instead of trying to manipulate the DOM into doing what we want it to do.FiddleThis plugin will alter the checked property of any elements selected by jQuery, and successfully check and uncheck checkboxes under all circumstances. So, while this may seem like an over-bearing solution, it will make your site\'s user experience better, and help prevent user frustration.Alternatively, if you do not want to use a plugin, you can use the following code snippets:You can doorIf you have custom code in the onclick event for the checkbox that you want to fire, use this one instead:You can uncheck by removing the attribute entirely:You can check all checkboxes like this:You can also extend the $.fn object with new methods:Then you can just do:Or you may want to give them more unique names like mycheck() and myuncheck()  in case you use some other library that uses those names.The last one will fire the click event for the checkbox, the others will not.\nSo if you have custom code in the onclick event for the checkbox that you want to fire, use the last one.To check a checkbox you should useorand to uncheck a check box you should always set it to false:If you doit removes the attribute all together and therefore you will not be able to reset the form.BAD DEMO jQuery 1.6. I think this is broken. For 1.6 I am going to make a new post on that.NEW WORKING DEMO jQuery 1.5.2 works in Chrome.Both demos useI\'m missing the solution. I\'ll always use:Assuming that the question is...Remember that in a typical checkbox set, all input tags have the same name, they differ by the attribute value:  there are no ID for each input of the set.Xian\'s answer can be extended with a more specific selector, using the following line of code:This selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing the given substring:It will select all elements that contain ckbItem in its name attribute.Here is a way to do it without jQueryTry this:To check a checkbox using jQuery 1.6 or higher just do this:To uncheck, use:Here\' s what I like to use to toggle a checkbox using jQuery:If you\'re using jQuery 1.5 or lower:To uncheck, use:If you are using PhoneGap doing application development, and you have a value on the button that you want to show instantly, remember to do thisI found that without the span, the interface will not update no matter what you do.We can use elementObject with jQuery for getting the attribute checked:We can use this for all jQuery versions without any error.Update: Jquery 1.6+ has the new prop method which replaces attr, e.g.:Here is code for checked and unchecked with a button:Update: Here is the same code block using the newer Jquery 1.6+ prop method, which replaces attr:Another possible solution:Here is the code and demo for how to check multiple check boxes...http://jsfiddle.net/tamilmani/z8TTt/If using mobile and you want the interface to update and show the checkbox as unchecked, use the following:To check and uncheckBe aware of memory leaks in Internet Explorer prior to Internet Explorer 9, as the jQuery documentation states:In Internet Explorer prior to version 9, using .prop() to set a DOM\n  element property to anything other than a simple primitive value\n  (number, string, or boolean) can cause memory leaks if the property is\n  not removed (using .removeProp()) before the DOM element is removed\n  from the document. To safely set values on DOM objects without memory\n  leaks, use .data().For jQuery 1.6+For jQuery 1.5.x and belowTo check,This is probably the shortest and easiest solution:orEven shorter would be:Here is a jsFiddle as well.Plain JavaScript is very simple and much less overhead:Example hereI couldn\'t get it working using:Both true and false would check the checkbox. What worked for me was:When you checked a checkbox like;it might not be enough. You should also call the function below;Especially when you removed the checkbox checked attribute.Here\'s the complete answer\nusing jQueryI test it and it works 100% :DIn jQuery,or In JavaScript,In case you use ASP.NET MVC, generate many checkboxes and later have to select/unselect all using JavaScript you can do the following.HTMLJavaScript
