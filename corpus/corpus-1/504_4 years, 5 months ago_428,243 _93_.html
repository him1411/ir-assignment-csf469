I copied package.json from another project and now want to bump all of the dependencies to their latest versions since this is a fresh project and I don\'t mind fixing something if it breaks.What\'s the easiest way to do this?The best way I know of now is to run npm info express version then update package.json manually for each one. There must be a better way.I am now a collaborator on npm-check-updates, which is a great solution to this problem.I have been actively maintaining npm-check-updates for the last 8 months. v2 was released just a few weeks ago, containing a simplified output and many bug fixes and new options. Enjoy.Looks like npm-check-updates is the only way to make this happen now.On npm <3.11:Simply change every dependency\'s version to *, then run npm update --save.  (Note: broken in recent (3.11) versions of npm).Before:After:Of course, this is the blunt hammer of updating dependencies.  It\'s fine if—as you said—the project is empty and nothing can break.On the other hand, if you\'re working in a more mature project, you probably want to verify that there are no breaking changes in your dependencies before upgrading.To see which modules are outdated, just run npm outdated.  It will list any installed dependencies that have newer versions available.npm-check-updates is a utility that automatically adjusts a package.json with the \nlatest version of all dependenciessee https://www.npmjs.org/package/npm-check-updatesThings have changed a bit since these answers were originally written.Be sure to shrinkwrap your deps, or you may wind up with a dead project.  I pulled out a project the other day and it wouldn\'t run because my deps were all out of date/updated/a mess.  If I\'d shrinkwrapped, npm would have installed exactly what I needed.For the curious who make it this far, here is what I recommend:If you check npm-shrinkwrap.json into git, all installs will use the exact same versions.  This is a way to transition out of development (all updates, all the time) to production (nobody touch nothing).npm outdatednpm-check-updatesnpm shrinkwrapTo update one dependency to its lastest version without having to manually open the package.json and change it, you can runi.e.For reference, npm-installAs noted by user Vespakoen on a rejected edit, it\'s also possible to update multiple packages at once this way:He also apports a one-liner for the shell based on npm outdated. See the edit for code and explanation.PS: I also hate having to manually edit package.json for things like that ;)This works as of npm 1.3.15.Here is an example:The only caveat I have found with the best answer above is that it updates the modules to the latest version. This means it could update to an unstable alpha build.I would use that npm-check-updates utility.\nMy group used this tool and it worked effectively by installing the stable updates.As Etienne stated above: install and run with this:Here is a basic regex to match semantic version numbers so you can quickly replace them all with an asterisk.Select the package versions you want to replace in the JSON file.Input the regex above and verify it\'s matching the correct text.Replace all matches with an asterisk.Run npm update --saveIf you happen to be using Visual Studio Code as your IDE, this is a fun little extension to make updating package.json a one click process.I recently had to update several projects that were using npm and package.json for their gruntfile.js magic. The following bash command (multiline command) worked well for me:The idea here:\nTo pipe the npm outdated output as json, to jq\n(jq is a json command line parser/query tool)\n(notice the use of --depth argument for npm outdated)\njq will strip the output down to just the top level package name only.\nfinally xargs puts each LIBRARYNAME one at a time into a npm install LIBRARYNAME --save-dev commandThe above is what worked for me on a machine runnning:\nnode=v0.11.10 osx=10.9.2 npm=1.3.24this required:\nxargs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs (native to my machine I believe)\nand\njq http://stedolan.github.io/jq/ (I installed it with brew install jq)Note: I only save the updated libraries to package.json inside of the json key devDependancies by using --save-dev, that was a requirement of my projects, quite possible not yours.Afterward I check that everything is gravy with a simpleAlso, you can check the current toplevel installed library versions withUpdtr!Based on npm outdated, updtr installs the latest version and runs npm test for each dependency. If the test succeeds, updtr saves the new version number to your package.json. If the test fails, however, updtr rolls back its changes.https://github.com/peerigon/updtrThe above commands are unsafe because you might break your module when switching versions.\nInstead I recommend the followingI use npm-check to archive this.Another useful command list which will keep exact version numbers in package.json\nI really like how npm-upgrade works. It is a simple command line utility that goes through all of your dependencies and lets you see the current version compared to the latest version and update if you want. Here is a screenshot of what happens after running npm-upgade in the root of your project:For each dependency you can choose to upgrade, ignore, view the changelog, or finish the process. It has worked great for me so far.Alternative iseverytime you use npm update , it automatically update to the latest version.\nFor more version syntax, you may check here: https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/semver.htmlA very late reply. but may help someone. this feature has been introduced in npm v5. update to npm using npm install -g npm@latest and to update package.json delete /node_modules and package-lock.json (if you have any) run npm update. this will update package.json to the latest version with installed dependencies. Still npm5 is buggy and will be fixed soonto update to very latest version. you can go with npm-check-updatesTry following command if you using npm 5 and node 8npm update --saveSolution without additional packagesChange every dependency\'s version to *:Then run npm update --save.Some of your packages were updated, but some not?This is the tricky part, it means your local version of "react" was lower than the newest one. In this case npm downloaded and updated "react" package. However your local version of "react-google-maps" is the same as the newest one.If you still want to "update" unchanged *, you have to delete these modules from node_modules folder.e.g. delete node_modules/react-google-maps.Finally run again npm update --save.Do not forget to run  npm update --save-dev if you want to update development dependencies.Greenkeeper if you\'re using Github. https://greenkeeper.io/It\'s a Github integration and incredibly easy to set things up. When installed, it automatically creates pull requests in repositories you specify (or all if wanted) and keeps your code always up-to-date, without forcing you to do anything manually. PRs should then trigger a build on a CI service and depending on a successful or failed check you can keep figuring out what\'s triggering the issue or when CI passes simply merge the PR.\nAt the bottom, you can see that the first build failed at first and after a commit ("upgrade to node v6.9") the tests pass so I could finally merge the PR. Comes with a lot of emoji, too.Another alternative would be https://dependencyci.com/, however I didn\'t test it intensively. After a first look Greenkeeper looks better in general IMO and has better integration.If you are using yarn, yarn upgrade-interactive is a really sleek tool that can allow you to view your outdated dependencies and then select which ones you want to update.More reasons to use Yarn over npm. Heh.One easy step:Ncu is a new alias to check for updates. By doing so you do not have to manually update ur version numbers in package.json ncu does it for you . Follow the method below if you are in a Linux machine Should get you the latest wanted versions compatible for your app. But not the latest versions.This is what I did to update all the dependencies in package.json to latest:
