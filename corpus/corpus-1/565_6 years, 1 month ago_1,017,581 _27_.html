How do I delete a file or folder in Python?os.remove() will remove a file.os.rmdir() will remove an empty directory.shutil.rmtree() will delete a directory and all its contents.Use (see complete doc on shutil) and/orand(complete doc on os)You can use unlink or remove. OrThis functions removes (deletes) the file path. If path is a directory, OSError is raised.In Python 2, if the path does not exist, OSError with [Errno 2] (ENOENT) is raised. In Python 3, FileNotFoundError with [Errno 2] (ENOENT) is raised. In Python 3, because FileNotFoundError is a subclass of OSError, catching the latter will catch the former.rmdir Remove (delete) the directory path. Only works when the directory is empty, otherwise, OSError is raised. \nIn order to remove whole directory trees, shutil.rmtree() can be used.shutil.rmtree Delete an entire directory tree. Path must point to a directory (but not a symbolic link to a directory). If ignore_errors is true, errors resulting from failed removals will be ignored and if false or omitted, such errors are handled by calling a handler specified by onerror or, if that is omitted, they raise an exception.See also:os.removedirs(name) Remove directories recursively. Works like rmdir() except that, if the leaf directory is successfully removed, removedirs() tries to successively remove every parent directory mentioned in path until an error is raised (which is ignored, because it generally means that a parent directory is not empty). For example, os.removedirs(\'foo/bar/baz\') will first remove the directory \'foo/bar/baz\', and then remove \'foo/bar\' and \'foo\' if they are empty. ORBest Practice:\n1. First check whether the file or folder exits or not then only delete that file. This can be achieved in two ways :\na. os.path.isfile("/path/to/file")\nb. Use exception handling.EXAMPLE for os.path.isfileException HandlingRESPECTIVE OUTPUTExample for shutil.rmtree()Create a function for you guys.You can use the built-in pathlib module (requires Python 3.4) to remove a file (unlink):or an empty folder (rmdir):
