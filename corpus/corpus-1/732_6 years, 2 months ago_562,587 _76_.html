I cloned a git repository from my Github account to my PC. I want to work with both my PC and laptop, but with one Github account. When I try to push to or pull from Github using my PC, it requires username and password, but not when using the laptop!I don\'t want to type my username and password every time I interact with origin.\nWhat I am missing here? A common mistake is cloning using the default (HTTPS) instead of SSH. You can correct this by going to your repository, clicking the ssh button left to the URL field and updating the URL of your origin remote like this:I just came across the same problem, and the simplest solution I found was to use SSH URL instead of HTTPS one:And not this:You can now validate with just the SSH Key instead of the username and password. Apart from changing to SSH you can also keep using HTTPS, if you don\'t mind to put your password in clear text. Put this in your ~/.netrc and it won\'t ask for your username/password (at least on Linux and Mac):Addition (see VonC\'s 2nd comment): on Windows the file name is %HOME%\\_netrc.Also read VonC\'s first comment in case you want to encrypt.Another addition (see user137717\'s comment) which you can use if you have git 1.7.10 or newer. Cache your github password in git using a credential helper :If you\'re cloning GitHub repositories using HTTPS, you can use a\n  credential helper to tell Git to remember your GitHub username and\n  password every time it talks to GitHub.This also works on Linux, Mac and Windows.Run following command to enable credential caching:Use should also specify caching expire,After enabling credential caching, it will be cached for 7200 seconds (2 hour).For the uninitiated who are confused by the previous answers, you can do:git remote -vwhich will respond something likethen you can run the command many other have suggested, but now you know yourname and yourrepo from above, so you can just cut and paste yourname/yourrepo.git from above intoIf you\'re using ssh and your private key is encrypted with a passphrase, then you\'ll still be prompted to enter the passphrase/password for the private key when you do network operations with Git like push, pull, and fetch.If you want to avoid having to enter your passphrase every time, you can use ssh-agent to store your private key passphrase credentials once per terminal session, as I explain in my answer to Could not open a connection to your authentication agent:In a Windows msysgit Bash, you need to evaluate the output of ssh-agent, but I\'m not sure if you need to do the same in other development environments and operating systems.ssh-add looks for a private key in your home .ssh folder called id_rsa, which is the default name, but you can pass a filepath to a key with a different name.When you\'re done with your terminal session, you can shutdown ssh-agent with the kill flag -k:As explained in the ssh-agent manual:Kill the current agent (given by the SSH_AGENT_PID environment variable).Also, it can take an optional timeout parameter like so:where <timeout> is of the format <n>h for <n> hours, <n>m for <n> minutes, and so on.According to the ssh-agent manual:Set a default value for the maximum lifetime of identities added\n  to the agent.  The lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a\n  time format specified in sshd_config(5).  A lifetime specified\n  for an identity with ssh-add(1) overrides this value.  Without\n  this option the default maximum lifetime is forever.See this page for more time formats.Cygwin users should be aware of a potential security risk with using ssh-agent in Cygwin:people should be cognizant of the \n  potential dangers of ssh-agent under cygwin [1], though under a local \n  netstat and remote portscan it does not appear that the port specified in \n  /tmp/ssh-foo is accessible to anyone ...?And at the cited link:however,  note  that  cygwin\'s  unix domain sockets are FUNDAMENTALLY\n  INSECURE  and  so  i  strongly  DISCOURAGE usage of ssh-agent under\n  cygwin.when  you  run  ssh-agent  under  cygwin  it creates AF_UNIX socket in\n  /tmp/ssh-$USERNAME/  directory.  under  cygwin  AF_UNIX  sockets  are\n  emulated  via  AF_INET sockets. you can easily see that if you\'ll look\n  into  /tmp/ssh-$USERNAME/agent-socket-*  file  via notepad. you\'ll see\n  the something likethen run netstat -a and surprise! you have some program listening to\n  port  2080.  it\'s  ssh-agent.  when  ssh  receives  RSA challenge from\n  server,  it  refers to corresponding /tmp/ssh-$USERNAME/agent-socket-*\n  (under  cygwin,  in  our  case,  that  means  it\'ll open connection to\n  localhost:2080)  and  asks  ssh-agent  to  process  RSA challenge with\n  private  key  it has, and then it simply passes response received from\n  ssh-agent to server.under  unix, such scenario works without problems, because unix kernel\n  checks  permissions  when  program tries to access AF_UNIX socket. For\n  AF_INET    sockets,   however,   connections   are   anonymous  (read\n  "insecure").   Imagine,  that  you  have  cygwin  ssh-agent  running.\n  malicious  hacker  may  portscan  your  box,  locate open port used by\n  ssh-agent,  open  connection to your ssh server, receive RSA challenge\n  from it, send it to your ssh-agent via open port he found, receive RSA\n  response,  send  it to ssh server and voila, he successfully logged in\n  to your server as you.Source: Set Up GitThe following command will save your password in memory for sometime. \n(For git 1.7.10 or newer.)When you use https for git pull & push, just config remote.origin.url for your project, to avoid input username (or/and password) everytime you push.How to config remote.origin.url:I think using ssh protocol is a better solution than https, even though the setup step is a little more complex.Rough steps:Tips:Simply change remote.origin.url will be enough, or you can edit repo_home/.git/config directly to change the value (e.g using vi on linux).Usually I add a line for each protocol, and comment out one of them using #.e.gYou can cache your GitHub password in Git:Just follow the instructions from the github\'s official documentation.After following the instructions from the above link, you should be able to push/pull to/from your repo without typing your username/password every time. Update for HTTPS:Github has launched a new program for Windows that stores your credentials when you\'re using HTTPS:To use:Download the program from hereOnce you run the program it will edit your .gitconfig file. Recheck if it edited the correct .gitconfig in case you have several of them. If it didn\'t edit the correct one, add the following to your .gitconfigNOTE the line break after [credential]. It is required.Open up your command line client and try git push origin master once. If it asks you for a password, enter it and you\'re through. Password saved!You basically have two options.If you use the same user on both machines you need to copy the .pub key to your PC, so github knows that you are the same user.If you have created a new .pub file for your PC and want to treat the machines as different users, you need to register the new .pub file on the github website. If this still doesn\'t work it might be because ssh is not configured correctly and that ssh fail to find the location of your keys. TryTo get more information why SSH fails.What worked for me was to edit .git/config and useIt goes without saying that this is an insecure way of storing your password but there are environments/cases where this may not be a problem.I had the same same issue.so change the .git/config file from my projectto and add the ssh public key to the git profile which is in setting.for ssh public keyIf you are using git (ex. git bash) under Windows \n(and if you don\'t want to switch from https to ssh)you could also use http://gitcredentialstore.codeplex.com/ This application will keep username and password for you...
