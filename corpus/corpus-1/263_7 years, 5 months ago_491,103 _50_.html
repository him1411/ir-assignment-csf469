I would prefer to write my commit messages in Vim, but it is opening them in Emacs.How do I configure Git to always use Vim?  Note that I want to do this globally, not just for a single project.If you want to set the editor only for Git, do either (you don\xe2\x80\x99t need both):If you want to set the editor for Git and also other programs, set the standardized VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables*:* Setting both is not necessarily needed, but some programs may not use the more-correct VISUAL. See VISUAL vs. EDITOR.For Sublime Text:\nAdd this to the .gitconfig. The --wait is important. (it allows to type text in sublime and will wait for save/close event.\'subl\' can be replaced by the full path of the executable but is usually available when correctly installed.Copy paste this:In case you\'d like to know what you\'re doing. From man git-commit:The editor used to edit the commit log message will be chosen from the GIT_EDITOR environment variable, the core.editor configuration variable, the VISUAL environment variable, or the EDITOR environment variable (in that order).On Ubuntu and also Debian (thanks @MichielB) changing the default editor is also possible by running: Which will prompt the following:In windows 7, while adding the "Sublime" editor it was still giving me an error: Aborting commit due to empty commit message.Sublime was not able to keep the focus.To fix this I opened the .gitconfig file in c:/users/username/ folder and added the following line with --wait option outside the double quotes.Hope its helpful to somebody facing similar issue with Sublime.And if you are working with designers using the command line then Pico, and dont know short cuts ;)OrRun this command:Or just:To Make Visual Studio Code (vscode) your default git editorFor emacs users.emacs:shellrc:Atom needs to be configured to run from the command line for the above to work:OS X: install shell commands from Atom: menu bar > Atom >\n  Install Shell CommandsWindows: no action required - atom is configured to run from the command line by defaultHit Ctrl+S to save your commit message. To discard, just close the notepad window without saving.In case you hit the shortcut for save, then decide to abort, go to File->Save as, and in the dialog that opens, change "Save as type" to "All files (*.*)". You will see a file named "COMMIT_EDITMSG". Delete it, and close notepad window. Edit: Alternatively, and more easily, delete all the contents from the open notepad window and hit save. (thanks mwfearnley for the comment!)I think for small write-ups such as commit messages notepad serves best, because it is simple, is there with windows, opens up in no time. Even your sublime may take a second or two to get fired up when you have a load of plugins and stuff.Like all the other GUI applications, you have to launch mvim with the wait flag.Just try EDITOR=vim git commit. Or you can set your EDITOR to vim by export EDITOR=vim in your bashrc. Also, make sure your "TextWrangler > Preferences > Application > When TextWrangler becomes active:" setting is set to "Do nothing"This works for me on OS X 10.11.4 with TextWrangler 5.0.2 from the Mac app store.Explanation:The -n means open in a new instance.The -W means to wait until the application exits before using the contents of the edited file as the commit message.The -a TextWrangler means use the TextWrangler application to open the file.See man open in your Mac Terminal app for more details.For Windows users who want to use neovim with the Windows Subsystem for Linux:git config core.editor "C:/Windows/system32/bash.exe --login -c \'nvim .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG\'"\nThis is not a fool-proof solution as it doesn\'t handle interactive rebasing (for example). Improvements very welcome!This opens Textmate editor in when you want to edit your commits.\nRequires textmate command line tools to be installed.git config --global core.editor "mate -w"for users of mc:\ngit config --global core.editor "mcCreate a file called \'k.sh\', add the following text and place in your home directory (~):At the git prompt type:
