I\'d like to convert a float to a whole number in JavaScript. Actually, I\'d like to know how to do BOTH of the standard conversions: by truncating and by rounding. And efficiently, not via converting to a string and parsing.Math object referenceA bitwise or operator can be used to truncate floating point figures and it works for positives as well as negatives:ResultsI\'ve created a JSPerf test that compares performance between:that only works with positive numbers. In this case you\'re safe to use bitwise operations well as Math.floor function.But if you need your code to work with positives as well as negatives, then a bitwise operation is the fastest (OR being the preferred one). This other JSPerf test compares the same where it\'s pretty obvious that because of the additional sign checking Math is now the slowest of the four.As stated in comments, BITWISE operators operate on signed 32bit integers, therefore large numbers will be converted, example:Note: You cannot use Math.floor() as a replacement for truncate, because Math.floor(-3.1) = -4 and not -3 !!A correct replacement for truncate would be:A double bitwise not operator can be used to truncate floats.  The other operations you mentioned are available through Math.floor, Math.ceil, and Math.round.More details courtesy of James Padolsey.For truncate:For round:You can use the parseInt method for no rounding.  Be careful with user input due to the 0x (hex) and 0 (octal) prefix options.Bit shift by 0 which is equivalent to division by 1In your case, when you want a string in the end (in order to insert commas), you can also just  use the Number.toFixed() function, however, this will perform rounding.There are many suggestions here. The bitwise OR seems to be the simplest by far. Here is another short solution which works with negative numbers as well using the modulo operator. It is probably easier to understand than the bitwise OR:This method also works with high value numbers where neither \'|0\' nor \'~~\' nor \'>>0\' work correctly:One more possible way \xe2\x80\x94 use XOR operation:Priority of bitwise operations is less then priority of math operations, it\'s useful. Try on https://jsfiddle.net/au51uj3r/To truncate:To round:If you are using angularjs then simple solution as follows In HTML Template Binding\n{{val | number:0}} it will convert val into integergo through with this link docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/numberI just want to point out that monetarily you want to round, and not trunc. Being off by a penny is much less likely, since 4.999452 * 100 rounded will give you 5, a more representative answer.And on top of that, don\'t forget about banker\'s rounding, which is a way to counter the slightly positive bias that straight rounding gives -- your financial application may require it.Gaussian/banker's rounding in JavaScript
