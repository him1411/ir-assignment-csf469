After doing a search in Vim, I get all the occurrences highlighted. How can I disable that?  I now do another search for something gibberish that can\'t be found.Is there a way to just temporarily disable the highlight and then re-enable it when needed again?To turn off highlighting until the next search:Or turn off highlighting completely:Or, to toggle it:From the VIM DocumentationTo clear the last used search pattern:This will not set the pattern to an empty string, because that would match \neverywhere. The pattern is really cleared, like when starting Vim.You can door :nohlsearch to temporarily disable search highlighting until the next search.I found this answer years ago on vim.org:Add the following to your .vimrc:Thus, after your search, just hit return again in command mode, and the highlighting disappears. From http://twitter.com/jonbho/status/2194406821The second line is needed for mapping to the escape key since Vim internally uses escape to represent special keys.Search for an unlikely character sequence (mash the keys on the home row):/;alskdjf;This works in vim and less, and it\'s easier to remember/type than @ShaunBouckaert\'s logically cleaner solution "to clear the last used search pattern"::let @/ = ""A potential downside is that it adds junk to your search history.I generally map :noh to the backslash key.  To reenable the highlighting, just hit n, and it will highlight again.Remapped to  in my .vimrc.local file, quick and dirty but very functional:That way I get rid of :noh shown in the commandline, when hitting enter after the search.: is like starting entering a new command, Backspace clears it and puts the focus back into the editor window.  Matches won\'t be highlighted whenever you do a search using /or :nohlsearch (clears until n or N is pressed)Clear highlights on pressing \\ (backslash)Clear highlights on hitting ESC twiceThe answers proposing :noh or :nohlsearch (e.g., Matt McMinn\xe2\x80\x99s) are correct for temporarily disabling search highlighting \xe2\x80\x93 as asked in the original question.I thought I\'d contribute a mapping that I find useful in Normal mode:By default, CtrlL in Vim clears and redraws the screen. A number of command line programs (mostly those using the GNU Readline library, such as Bash) use the same key combination to clear the screen. This feature is useful in the situation where a process running in the background prints to the terminal, over-writing parts of the foreground process.This Normal mode mapping also clears the highlighting of most recent search term before redrawing the screen. I find the two features complement each other and it\xe2\x80\x99s convenient to use one CtrlL for both actions together rather than create a separate mapping for disabling search highlighting.NB: noremap is used rather than map as otherwise, the mapping would be recursive.Tip: I usually remap Caps Lock to Ctrl to make it easier to type such key combinations; the details for doing this depend on your choice of OS / windowing system (and are off-topic for this answer). Both the following tips include information on mapping  Caps Lock to Ctrl as well as Esc:This is what I use (extracted from a lot of different questions/answers):With "double" Esc you remove the highlighting, but as soon as you search again, the highlighting reappears.Another alternative:According to vim documentation:clearmatches() Janus for VIM and GVIM has a number of baked-in things for newbs like me, includingwhich is exactly what you need. Just type \\hs in normal mode. (The leader key is mapped to \\ by default.)HTH.To turn off highlighting until the next searchThis will clear the search highlight after updatetime milliseconds of inactivity.  updatetime defaults to 4000ms or 4s but I set mine to 10s.  It is important to note that updatetime does more than just this so read the docs before you change it.One more solution by combining 2 top answers:If you want to be able to enable/disable highlighting quickly, you can map a key toJust put the above snippet in you .vimrc file. That\'s the most convenient way for me to show and hide the search highlight with a sing key stroke For more information check the documentation http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Highlight_all_search_pattern_matchesThere are two \'must have\' plugins for this:If you have incsearch.vim plugin installed, then there is a setting to automatically clear highlight after searching:I think mixing @ShaunBouckaert and Mar 19 \'09 at 16:22 answers is a good compromise :Press Enter and the highlighted text is no longer highlighted, while search highlighting is still enabled.you can use :noremap to turn on/off  for the search result,like this:noremap <F3> :set hls! hls?<CR>I just use the simple nohl below and no plugins are needed.:nohlBased on @baruch-even answer, you can delete search term on ESC double press  while in normal mode with:My guess is that the original question concerned not disabling search highlighting but simply clearing the highlighting from the last search. The solution of searching for a gibberish string, which the original poster mentioned, is one I\'ve been using for some time to clear highlighting from a previous search, but it\'s ugly and cumbersome.Several suggestions I\'ve found to add nnoremap ... to ~/.vimrc have the effect here of putting vim into replace mode at startup, which isn\'t at all what I want. The simplest solution I\'ve found is to add the lineto my ~/.vimrc. This hews to the KISS principle and doesn\'t interfere with the arrow keys, which using a single <esc> does. A double-<esc> is required in command mode (or a triple-<esc> from insert or replace mode) to clear highlighting from a previous search, but from a UI perspective this makes the operation about as simple as possible.Rather than relying on some keymap programmed into your .vimrc file (which doesn\'t hold for other installations), just use this hack: re-search for something improbable:
