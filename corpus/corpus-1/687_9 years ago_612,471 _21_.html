I am using setInterval(fname, 10000); to call a function every 10 seconds in JavaScript. Is it possible to stop calling it on some event? I want the user to be able to stop the repeated refresh of data.setInterval() returns an interval ID, which you can pass to clearInterval():See the docs for setInterval() and clearInterval().If you set the return value of setInterval to a variable, you can use clearInterval to stop it.You can set a new variable and have it incremented by ++ (count up one) every time it runs, then I use a conditional statement to end it:I hope that it helps and it is right.The answers above have already explained how setInterval returns a handle, and how this handle is used to cancel the Interval timer.Some architectural considerations:Please do not use "scope-less" variables. The safest way is to use the attribute of a DOM object. The easiest place would be "document". If the refresher is started by a start/stop button, you can use the button itself:Since the function is defined inside the button click handler, you don\'t have to define it again. The timer can be resumed if the button is clicked on again.@cnu,You can stop interval, when try run code before look ur console browser (F12) ... try comment clearInterval(trigger) is look again a console, not beautifier? :PCheck example a source:Already answered... But if you need a featured, re-usable timer that also supports multiple tasks on different intervals, you can use my TaskTimer (for Node and browser).  In your case, when users click for disturbing the data-refresh; you can call timer.pause() then timer.resume() if they need to re-enable.See more here.Simply add a class that tells the interval not to do anything. For example: on hover.I\'ve been looking for this fast and easy approach for ages, so I\'m posting several versions to introduce as many people to it as possible.
