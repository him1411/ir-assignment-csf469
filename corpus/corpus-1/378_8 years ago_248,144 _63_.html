NOTE: This question was asked from the viewpoint of ECMAScript version 3 or 5. The answers might become outdated with the introduction of new features in the release of ECMAScript 6.What exactly is the function of the var keyword in Javascript, and what is the difference between:and:When would you use either one, and why/what does it do?If you\'re in the global scope then there\'s no difference.If you\'re in a function then var will create a local variable, "no var" will look up the scope chain until it finds the variable or hits the global scope (at which point it will create it):If you\'re not doing an assignment then you need to use var:There\'s a difference.var x = 1 declares variable x in current scope (aka execution context). If the declaration appears in a function - a local variable is declared; if it\'s in global scope - a global variable is declared.x = 1, on the other hand, is merely a property assignment. It first tries to resolve x against scope chain. If it finds it anywhere in that scope chain, it performs assignment; if it doesn\'t find x, only then does it creates x property on a global object (which is a top level object in a scope chain). Now, notice that it doesn\'t declare a global variable, it creates a global property.The difference between the two is subtle and might be confusing unless you understand that variable declarations also create properties (only on a Variable Object) and that every property in Javascript (well, ECMAScript) have certain flags that describe their properties - ReadOnly, DontEnum and DontDelete.Since variable declaration creates property with the DontDelete flag, the difference between var x = 1 and x = 1 (when executed in global scope) is that the former one - variable declaration - creates the DontDelete\'able property, and latter one doesn\'t. As a consequence, the property created via this implicit assignment can then be deleted from the global object, and the former one - the one created via variable declaration - cannot be deleted.But this is just theory of course, and in practice there are even more differences between the two, due to various bugs in implementations (such as those from IE).Hope it all makes sense : )[Update 2010/12/16]In ES5 (ECMAScript 5; recently standardized, 5th edition of the language) there\'s a so-called "strict mode" \xe2\x80\x94 an opt-in language mode, which slightly changes the behavior of undeclared assignments. In strict mode, assignment to an undeclared identifier is a ReferenceError. The rationale for this was to catch accidental assignments, preventing creation of undesired global properties. Some of the newer browsers have already started rolling support for strict mode. See, for example, my compat table.Saying it\'s the difference between "local and global" isn\'t entirely accurate.It might be better to think of it as the difference between "local and nearest". The nearest can surely be global, but that won\'t always be the case.When Javascript is executed in a browser, all your code is surrounded by a with statement, like so:More info on with - MDNSince var declares a variable in the current scope , there is no difference between declaring var inside window and not declaring it at all.The difference comes when you\'re not directly inside the window, e.g. inside a function or inside a block.Using var lets you hide external variables that have the same name. In this way you can simulate a "private" variable, but that\'s another topic.A rule of thumb is to always use var, because otherwise you run the risk of introducing subtle bugs.EDIT:\nAfter the critiques I received, I would like to emphasize the following:You should always use the var keyword to declare variables. Why? Good coding practice should be enough of a reason in itself, but declaring a variable without the var keyword means it is declared in the global scope (a variable like this is called an "implied" global). Douglas Crockford recommends never using implied globals, and according to the Apple JavaScript Coding Guidelines:Any variable created without the var\n  keyword is created at the global scope\n  and is not garbage collected when the\n  function returns (because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\n  go out of scope), presenting the\n  opportunity for a memory leak.So, in short, always declare variables using the var keyword.Here\'s quite a good example of how you can get caught out from not declaring local variables with var:(i is reset at every iteration of the loop, as it\'s not declared locally in the for loop but globally) eventually resulting in infinite loopI would say it\'s better to use var in most situations.Local variables are always faster than the variables in global scope.If you do not use var to declare a variable, the variable will be in global scope.For more information, you can search "scope chain JavaScript" in Google.another difference \ne.gwhile Using var is always a good idea to prevent variables from cluttering the global scope and variables from conflicting with each other, causing unwanted overwriting.Without var - global variable.Strongly recommended to ALWAYS use var statement, because init global variable in local context - is evil. But, if you need this dirty trick, you should write comment at start of page:var was the pre-ES6 way to declare a variable. We are now in the future, and you should be coding as such.const should be used for 95% of cases. It makes it so the variable reference can\'t change, thus array, object, and DOM node properties can change and should likely be const.let should be be used for any variable expecting to be reassigned. This includes within a for loop. If you ever write varName = beyond the initialization, use let.Both have block level scoping, as expected in most other languages.This is example code I have written for you to understand this concept:Inside a code you if you use a variable without using var, then what happens is the automatically var var_name is placed in the global scope eg:Without using "var" variables can only define when set a value. In example:cannot work in global scope or any other scope. It should be with value like:On the other hand you can define a vaiable like;Its value is undefined ( Its value is not null and it is not equal to null interestingly.).As someeone trying to learn this this is how I see it. The above examples were maybe a bit overly complicated for a beginner. If you run this code:The output will read as:  false, false, true, trueBecause it sees the variables in the function as seperate from those outside of it, hence the term local variable and this was because we used var in the assignment. If you take away the var in the function so it now reads like this:The output is false, false, false, falseThis is because rather than creating a new variable in the local scope or function it simply uses the global variables and reassigns them to false. I see people are confused when declaring variables with or without var and inside or outside the function. Here is a deep example that will walk you through these steps:See the script below in action here at jsfiddleConclusion You should use var keyword unless you intend to have the variable attached to window object in browser. Here\'s a link that explains scoping and difference between glocal scoping and local scoping with and wihtout var keyword.When variables get defined without the use of var keyword, what it looks like is a simple \xe2\x80\x9cassignment\xe2\x80\x9d operation.When the value is assigned to a variable in javascript, the interpreter first tries to find the \xe2\x80\x9cvariable declaration\xe2\x80\x9d in the same context/scope as that of assignment. When the interpreter executes dummyVariable = 20, it looks up for the declaration of dummyVariable at beginning of the function. \n(Since all Variable declarations are moved to the beginning of the context by javascript interpreter and this is called hoisting)You may also want to look at hoisting in javascript
