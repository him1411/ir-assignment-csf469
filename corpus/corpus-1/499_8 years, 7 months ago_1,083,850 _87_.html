Can someone suggest a way to compare the values of two dates greater than, less than, and not in the past using JavaScript? The values will be coming from text boxes...The Date object will do what you want - construct one for each date, then compare them using the >, <, <= or >=. The ==, !=, ===, and !== operators require you to use date.getTime() as in to be clear just checking for equality directly with the data objects won\'t workI suggest you use drop-downs or some similar constrained form of date entry rather than text boxes, though, lest you find yourself in input validation hell.The easiest way to compare dates in javascript is to first convert it to a Date object and then compare these date-objects.Below you find an object with three functions:dates.compare(a,b)Returns a number:dates.inRange (d,start,end)Returns a boolean or NaN:dates.convertUsed by the other functions to convert their input to a date object. The input can be.Compare < and > just as usual, but anything involving = should use a + prefix. Like so:Hope this helps!The relational operators < <= > >= can be used to compare JavaScript dates:However, the equality operators == != === !== cannot be used to compare (the value of) dates because:You can compare the value of dates for equality using any of these methods:Both Date.getTime() and Date.valueOf() return the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00 UTC. Both Number function and unary + operator call the valueOf() methods behind the scenes.By far the easiest method is to subtract one date from the other and compare the result.Compare day only (ignoring time component):Usage:what format?If you construct a Javascript Date object, you can just subtract them to get a milliseconds difference (edit: or just compare them) :you use this code,   And also check this link\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/js/js_obj_date.aspJust to add yet another possibility to the many existing options, you could try:...which seems to work for me.  Of course you do have to ensure that both dates are not undefined...This way we can ensure that a positive comparison is made if both are undefined also, or......if you prefer them not to be equal.SHORT ANSWERHere is a function that return {boolean} if the from dateTime > to dateTime Demo in actionExplanationjsFiddle since you are now having both datetime in number type\nyou can compare them with any Comparison operations ( >, < ,= ,!= ,== ,!== ,>= AND <=) Thenif you are familiar with C# Custom Date and Time Format String this library should do the exact same thing and help you format your date and time dtmFRM whether you are passing in date time string or unix format UsageDEMOall you have to do is passing any of these format pacified in the library js file To compare two date we can use date.js JavaScript library which can be found at : https://code.google.com/archive/p/datejs/downloadsand use the Date.compare( Date date1, Date date2 ) method and it return a number which mean the following result:-1 = date1 is lessthan date2.0 = values are equal. 1 = date1 is greaterthan date2.Subtract two date get the difference in millisecond, if you get 0 it\'s the same dateIn order to create dates from free text in Javascript you need to parse it into the Date() object.You could use Date.parse() which takes free text tries to convert it into a new date but if you have control over the page I would recommend using HTML select boxes instead or a date picker such as the YUI calendar control or the jQuery UI Datepicker.Once you have a date as other people have pointed out you can use simple arithmetic to subtract the dates and convert it back into a number of days by dividing the number (in seconds) by the number of seconds in a day (60*60*24 = 86400).Say you got the date objects A and B, get their EPOC time value, then subtract to get the difference in milliseconds.That\'s all.Via Moment.jsJsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/guhokemk/1/The method returns 1 if dateTimeA is greater than dateTimeBThe method returns 0 if dateTimeA equals dateTimeBThe method returns -1 if dateTimeA is less than dateTimeBAn Improved version of the code posted by "some" usage:Note - Compare Only Date Part:When we compare two date in javascript. It takes hours, minutes and seconds also into consideration.. So If we only need to compare date only, this is the approach: Now: if date1.valueOf()> date2.valueOf() will work like a charm.Comparing 2 dates in JavaScript is quite easy... JavaScript has built-in compression system for dates as well...Just follow these steps for comparing 2 dates value, for example you have 2 inputs which each has a Date value in String and you to compare them...1. you have 2 string values you get from an input and you\'d like to compare them, they are as below:2. They need to be Date Object to be compared as date values, so simply convert them to date, using new Date(), I just re-assign them for simplicity of explanation, but you can do it anyway you like:3. Now simply compare them,  using the > < >= <=If following is your date format, you can use this code:It will check whether 20121121 number is bigger than 20121103 or not.I usually store Dates as timestamps(Number) in databases.When I need to compare, I simply compare among those timestamps orconvert it to Date Object and then compare with > <if necessary.Note that == or === does not work properly unless your variables are references of the same Date Object.Convert those Date objects to timestamp(number) first and then compare equality of them.Use this code to compare the date using javascript.Thanks\nD.JeevaHere is what I did in one of my projects,calling this on form onsubmit.\nhope this helps.Before comparing the Dates object, try setting both of their milliseconds to zero like Date.setMilliseconds(0);.In some cases where the Date object is dynamically created in javascript, if you keep printing the Date.getTime(), you\'ll see the milliseconds changing, which will prevent the equality of both dates.Let\'s suppose that you deal with this 2014[:-/.]06[:-/.]06 or this 06[:-/.]06[:-/.]2014 date format, then you may compare dates this way As you can see, we strip separator(s) and then compare integers.Hi Here is my code to compare dates . In my case i am doing a check to not allow to select past dates.Another way to compare two dates, is through the toISOString() method. This is especially useful when comparing to a fixed date kept in a string, since you can avoid creating a short-lived object. By virtue of the ISO 8601 format, you can compare these strings lexicographically (at least when you\'re using the same timezone).I\'m not necessarily saying that it\'s better than using time objects or timestamps; just offering this as another option. There might be edge cases when this could fail, but I haven\'t stumbled upon them yet :)
