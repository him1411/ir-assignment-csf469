I would like to upload a file asynchronously with jQuery. This is my HTML:And here my Jquery code:Instead of the file being uploaded, I am only getting the filename. What can I do to fix this problem?I am using the jQuery Form Plugin to upload files.With HTML5 you can make file uploads with Ajax and jQuery. Not only that, you can do file validations (name, size, and MIME type) or handle the progress event with the HTML5 progress tag (or a div). Recently I had to make a file uploader, but I didn\'t want to use Flash nor Iframes or plugins and after some research I came up with the solution.The HTML:First, you can do some validation if you want. For example, in the onChange event of the file:Now the Ajax submit with the button\'s click:As you can see, with HTML5 (and some research) file uploading not only becomes possible but super easy. Try it with Google Chrome as some of the HTML5 components of the examples aren\'t available in every browser.There are various ready-made plugins on doing file upload for jQuery.Doing this kind of uploading hacks is not an enjoyable experience, so people enjoy using ready-made solutions.Here\'s few:You can search for more projects on NPM (using "jquery-plugin" as the keyword) or on Github.An important thing to understand with the "new" HTML5 file API is that is wasn\'t supported until IE\xc2\xa010. If the specific market you\'re aiming at has a higher-than-average prepensity toward older versions of Windows, you might not have access to it.Going into 2017, about 5% of browsers are one of IE 6, 7, 8 or 9. If you head into a big corporation (eg this is a B2B tool, or something you\'re delivering for training) that number can rocket. Just a few months ago \xe2\x80\x94in 2016\xe2\x80\x94 I dealt with a company using IE8 on over 60% of their machines.So before you do anything: check what browser your users use. If you don\'t, you\'ll learn a quick and painful lesson in why "works for me" isn\'t good enough in a deliverable to a client.My answer from 2008 follows.However, there are viable non-JS methods of file uploads. You can create an iframe on the page (that you hide with CSS) and then target your form to post to that iframe. The main page doesn\'t need to move.It\'s a "real" post so it\'s not wholly interactive. If you need status you need something server-side to process that. This varies massively depending on your server. ASP.NET has nicer mechanisms. PHP plain fails, but you can use Perl or Apache modifications to get around it.If you need multiple file-uploads, it\'s best to do each file one at a time (to overcome maximum file upload limits). Post the first form to the iframe, monitor its progress using the above and when it has finished, post the second form to the iframe, and so on.Or use a Java/Flash solution. They\'re a lot more flexible in what they can do with their posts...I recommend using the Fine Uploader plugin for this purpose. Your JavaScript code would be:This AJAX file upload jQuery plugin uploads the file somehwere, and passes the\nresponse to a callback, nothing else. -- Use as little as ---- or as much as --You cannot upload files using XMLHttpRequest (Ajax). You can simulate the effect using an iframe or Flash. Try the SWF (Flash) uploader SWFUpload.Or the excellent jQuery Form Plugin that posts your files through an iframe to get the effect.Wrapping up for future readers.You can upload files with jQuery using the $.ajax() method if FormData and the File API are supported (both HTML5 features). You can also send files without FormData but either way the File API must be present to process files in such a way that they can be sent with XMLHttpRequest (Ajax).For a quick, pure JavaScript (no jQuery) example see "Sending files using a FormData object".When HTML5 isn\'t supported (no File API) the only other pure JavaScript solution (no Flash or any other browser plugin) is the hidden iframe technique, which allows to emulate an asynchronous request without using the XMLHttpRequest object.It consists of setting an iframe as the target of the form with the file inputs. When the user submits a request is made and the files are uploaded but the response is displayed inside the iframe instead of re-rendering the main page. Hiding the iframe makes the whole process transparent to the user and emulates an asynchronous request.If done properly it should work virtually on any browser, but it has some caveats as how to obtain the response from the iframe. In this case you may prefer to use a wrapper plugin like Bifr\xc3\xb6st which uses the iframe technique but also provides a jQuery Ajax transport allowing to send files with just the $.ajax() method like this:Bifr\xc3\xb6st is just a small wrapper that adds fallback support to jQuery\'s ajax method, but many of the aforementioned plugins like jQuery Form Plugin or jQuery File Upload include the whole stack from HTML5 to different fallbacks and some useful features to ease out the process. Depending on your needs and requirements you might want to consider a bare implementation or either of this plugins.I have been using the below script to upload images which happens to work fine.I use response div to show the uploading animation and response after upload is done.Best part is you can send extra data such as ids & etc with the file when you use this script. I have mention it extra-data as in the script.At the PHP level this will work as normal file upload. extra-data can be retrieved as $_POST data.Here you are not using a plugin and stuff. You can change the code as you want. You are not blindly coding here. This is the core functionality of any jQuery file upload. Actually Javascript.I\'ve come across a few really powerful jQuery-based file upload libraries. Check these out:You can do it in vanilla JavaScript pretty easily. Here\'s a snippet from my current project:The simplest and most robust way I have done this in the past, is to simply target a hidden iFrame tag with your form - then it will submit within the iframe without reloading the page.That is if you don\'t want to use a plugin, JavaScript or any other forms of "magic" other than HTML.  Of course you can combine this with JavaScript or what have you...You can also read the contents of the iframe ( onLoad() ) for server error or success response and then output that to user.A wee update, if relying on the onload event of an iframe during a download don\'t count on it working in Chrome.  For this the only solution I found was to use a cookie, ugly but it worked.You can upload simply with AJAX.HTML:CSSJavascript:A solution I found was to have the <form> target a hidden iFrame. The iFrame can then run JS to display to the user that it\'s complete (on page load).I\'ve written this up in a Rails environment.  It\'s only about five lines of JavaScript, if you use the lightweight jQuery-form plugin.The challenge is in getting AJAX upload working as the standard remote_form_for doesn\'t understand multi-part form submission. It\'s not going to send the file data Rails seeks back with the AJAX request.   That\'s where the jQuery-form plugin comes into play.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s the Rails code for it:Here\xe2\x80\x99s the associated JavaScript:And here\xe2\x80\x99s the Rails controller action, pretty vanilla:I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using this for the past few weeks with Bloggity, and it\xe2\x80\x99s worked like a champ.Simple Ajax Uploader is another option:https://github.com/LPology/Simple-Ajax-UploaderExample usage:jQuery Uploadify is another good plugin which I have used before to upload files. The JavaScript code is as simple as the following: code. However, the new version does not work in InternetÂ Explorer.I have done a lot of searching and I have come to another solution for uploading files without any plugin and only with ajax. The solution is as below:Here\'s just another solution of how to upload file (without any plugin) Using simple Javascripts and AJAX (with progress-bar)HTML partJS partPHP partHere\'s the EXAMPLE applicationYou can use form data to post all your values including images.To upload file asynchronously with Jquery use below steps:step 1 In your project open Nuget manager and add package (jquery fileupload(only you need to write it in search box it will come up and install it.))\nURL: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Uploadstep 2 Add below scripts in the HTML files, which are already added to the project by running above package:jquery.ui.widget.jsjquery.iframe-transport.jsjquery.fileupload.jsstep 3  Write file upload control as per below code:step 4  write a js method as uploadFile as below: step 5 In ready function call element file upload to initiate the process as per below:step 6 Write MVC controller and Action as per below:You can useDemoConvert file to base64 using |HTML5\'s readAsDataURL() or some base64 encoder. \nFiddle hereThen to retrieve:You can see a solved solution with a working demo here that allows you to preview and submit form files to the server. For your case, you need to use Ajax to facilitate the file upload to the server:The data being submitted is a formdata. On your jQuery, use a form submit function instead of a button click to submit the form file as shown below.View more detailsSample: If you use jQuery, you can do easy to an upload file.
