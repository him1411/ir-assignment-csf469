After the last commit, I modified a bunch of files in my working copy, but I want to undo the changes to one of those files, as in reset it to the same state as the most recent commit.However, I only want to undo the working copy changes of just that one file alone, nothing else with it.How do I do that?You can useYou can do it without the -- (as suggested by nimrodm), but if the filename looks like a branch or tag (or other revision identifier), it may get confused, so using -- is best.You can also check out a particular version of a file:I used this today because I realized that my favicon had been overwritten a few commits ago when I upgrated to drupal 6.10, so I had to get it back. Here is what I did:Just useThis will replace filename with the latest version from the current branch.WARNING: your changes will be discarded â€” no backup is kept.If your file is already staged (happens when you do a git add etc after the file is edited) to unstage your changes.Use Then If not already staged, just useIf you want to just undo the previous commit\'s changes to that one file, you can try this:This will checkout the file as it was before the last commit. If you want to go a few more commits back, use the branchname~n notation.I restore my files using the SHA id, What i do is git checkout <sha hash id> <file name>I always get confused with this, so here is a reminder test case; let\'s say we have this bash script to test git:At this point, the change is not staged in the cache, so git status is:If from this point, we do git checkout, the result is this:If instead we do git reset, the result is:So, in this case - if the changes are not staged, git reset makes no difference, while git checkout overwrites the changes.Now, let\'s say that the last change from the script above is staged/cached, that is to say we also did git add b.txt at the end.In this case, git status at this point is:If from this point, we do git checkout, the result is this:If instead we do git reset, the result is:So, in this case - if the changes are staged, git reset will basically make staged changes into unstaged changes - while git checkout will overwrite the changes completely.If you have not yet pushed or otherwise shared your commit:This answers is for command needed for undoign local changes which are in multiple specific files in same or multiple folders(or directories). \nThis answers specifically addresses question where a user has more than one file but the user doesn\'t want to undo all local changes: if you have one or more files you could apply the samne command (git checkout -- file ) to\n  each of those files by listing each of their location separated by\n  space as in:mind the space abve between name1/name2/fileOne.ext nameA/subFolder/fileTwo.ext For multiple files in the same folder:If you happen to need to discard changes for all of the files in a\n  certain directory, use the git checkout as follows:The asterisk in the above does the trick of undoing all files at that location under name1/name2.And, similarly the following can undo changes in all files for\n  multiple folders:again mind the space between name1/name2/* nameA/subFolder/* in the\n  above.Note: name1, name2, nameA, subFolder - all of these example folder names indicate the folder or package where the file(s) in question may be residing.For me only this one workedIf it is already committed, you can revert the change for the file and commit again, then squash new commit with last commit.
