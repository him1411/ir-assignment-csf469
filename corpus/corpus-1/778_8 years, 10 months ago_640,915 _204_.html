Ok, after seeing this post by PJ Hyett, I have decided to skip to the end and go with Git.So what I need is a beginner\'s practical guide to Git.  "Beginner" being defined as someone who knows how to handle their compiler, understands to some level what a Makefile is, and has touched source control without understanding it very well."Practical" being defined as this person doesn\'t want to get into great detail regarding what Git is doing in the background, and doesn\'t even care (or know) that it\'s distributed.  Your answers might hint at the possibilities, but try to aim for the beginner that wants to keep a \'main\' repository on a \'server\' which is backed up and secure, and treat their local repository as merely a \'client\' resource.So:I will go through the entries from time to time and \'tidy\' them up so they have a consistent look/feel and it\'s easy to scan the list - feel free to follow a simple "header - brief explanation - list of instructions - gotchas and extra info" template.  I\'ll also link to the entries from the bullet list above so it\'s easy to find them later.A git repository is simply a directory containing a special .git directory.This is different from "centralised" version-control systems (like subversion), where a "repository" is hosted on a remote server, which you checkout into a "working copy" directory. With git, your working copy is the repository.Simply run git init in the directory which contains the files you wish to track.For example,This creates a .git (hidden) folder in the current directory.To make a new project, run git init with an additional argument (the name of the directory to be created):To check if the current current path is within a git repository, simply run git status - if it\'s not a repository, it will report "fatal: Not a git repository"You could also list the .git directory, and check it contains files/directories similar to the following:If for whatever reason you wish to "de-git" a repository (you wish to stop using git to track that project). Simply remove the .git directory at the base level of the repository.Caution: This will destroy all revision history, all your tags, everything git has done. It will not touch the "current" files (the files you can currently see), but previous changes, deleted files and so on will be unrecoverable!Included with git â€” Run git gui from the command line, and the Windows msysgit installer adds it to the Start menu.Git GUI can do a majority of what you\'d need to do with git. Including stage changes, configure git and repositories, push changes, create/checkout/delete branches, merge, and many other things.One of my favourite features is the "stage line" and "stage hunk" shortcuts in the right-click menu, which lets you commit specific parts of a file. You can achieve the same via git add -i, but I find it easier to use.It isn\'t the prettiest application, but it works on almost all platforms (being based upon Tcl/Tk)Screenshots | a screencastAlso included with git.

Mainly an equivalent of git log, but has some integration with github (like the "Network view").Looks pretty, and fits with Mac OS X. You can search repositories. The biggest critisism of Gitnub is that it shows history in a linear fashion (a single branch at a time) - it doesn\'t visualise branching and merging, which can be important with git, although this is a planned improvement.Download links, change log and screenshots | git repositoryIntends to be a "gitk clone for OS X".It can visualise non-linear branching history, perform commits, view and search commits, and it has some other nice features like being able to "Quicklook" any file in any revision (press space in the file-list view), export any file (via drag and drop).It is far better integrated into OS X than git-gui/gitk, and is fast and stable even with exceptionally large repositories.The original git repository pieter has not updated recently (over a year at time of writing).

Seriously, this 20+ questions in a question is going to be anything but concise and consistent.  The Git Community Book is available as both HTML and PDF and answers many of your questions with clear, well formatted and peer reviewed answers and in a format that allows you to jump straight to your problem at hand.Alas, if my post really upsets you then I\'ll delete it.  Just say so.The ability to have git ignore files you don\'t wish it to track is very useful. To ignore a file or set of files you supply a pattern.  The pattern syntax for git is fairly simple, but powerful. It is applicable to all three of the different files I will mention bellow.Great Example from the gitignore(5) man page:Generally there are three different ways to ignore untracked files. 1) Ignore for all users of the repository:Add a file named .gitignore to the root of your working copy.Edit .gitignore to match your preferences for which files should/shouldn\'t be ignored.and commit when you\'re done.  2) Ignore for only your copy of the repository:Add/Edit the file $GIT_DIR/info/exclude in your working copy, with your preferred patterns. Ex: My working copy is ~/src/project1 so I would edit ~/src/project1/.git/info/excludeYou\'re done!3) Ignore in all situations, on your system: Global ignore patterns for your system can go in a file named what ever you wish. Mine personally is called ~/.gitglobalignore I can then let git know of this file by editing my ~/.gitconfig file with the following line:You\'re done!I find the gitignore man page to be the best resource for more information. How do you \'mark\' \'tag\' or \'release\' a particular set of revisions for a particular set of files so you can always pull that one later?Using the git tag command.To simply "tag" the current revision, you would just run..To list the current tags, simply run git tag with no arguments, or -l (lower case L):To delete a tag, you use the -d flag:To tag a specific (previous) commit, you simply do..For example:Note: by default, git creates a "lightweight" tag (basically a reference to a specific revision). The "right" way is to use the -a flag. This will launch your editor asking for a tag message (identical to asking for a commit message, you can also use the -m flag to supply the tag message on the command line). Using an annotated tag creates an object with its own ID, date, tagger (author), and optionally a GPG signature (using the -s tag). \nFor further information on this, see this postAnd to list the tags with annotations, use the -n1 flag to show 1 line of each tag message (-n245 to show the first 245 lines of each annotation, and so on):For more information, see the git-tag(1) Manual PageWorkflow example with GIT.Git is extremely flexible and adapts good to any workflow, but not enforcing a particular workflow might have the negative effect of making it hard to understand what you can do with git beyond the linear "backup" workflow, and how useful branching can be for example.This blog post explains nicely a very simple but effective workflow that is really easy to setup using git.quoting from the blog post:\nWe consider origin/master to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state:The workflow has become popular enough to have made a project that implements this workflow: git-flow Nice illustration of a simple workflow, where you make all your changes in develop, and only push to master when the code is in a production state:Now let\'s say you want to work on a new feature, or on refactoring a module. You could create a new branch, what we could call a "feature" branch, something that will take some time and might break some code. Once your feature is "stable enough" and want to move it "closer" to production, you merge your feature branch into develop. When all the bugs are sorted out after the merge and your code passes all tests rock solid, you push your changes into master.During all this process, you find a terrible security bug, that has to be fixed right away. You could have a branch called hotfixes, that make changes that are pushed quicker back into production than the normal "develop" branch.Here you have an illustration of how this feature/hotfix/develop/production workflow might look like (well explained in the blog post, and I repeat, the blog post explains the whole process in a lot more detail and a lot better than I do.Here\'s a copy of PJ Hyett\'s post, as it is not available anymore:Nov 23, 2008When we tell people why they should\n  use Git over Subversion, the go-to\n  line is, \xe2\x80\x9cGit does Subversion better\n  than Subversion, but it does a lot\n  more than that.\xe2\x80\x9dThe \xe2\x80\x9clot more\xe2\x80\x9d is comprised of a bunch\n  of stuff that makes Git really shine,\n  but it can be pretty overwhelming for\n  those coming from other SCM\xe2\x80\x99s like\n  Subversion.That said, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing stopping\n  you from using Git just like you use\n  Subversion while you\xe2\x80\x99re making the\n  transition.Assuming you\xe2\x80\x99ve installed the\n  necessary software and have a remote\n  repository somewhere, this is how you\n  would grab the code and push your\n  changes back with Subversion:$ svn checkout svn://foo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk foo\n  # make your changes\n  $ svn commit -m "my first commit"And how would you do it in Git:$ git clone git@github.com:pjhyett/foo.git\n  # make your changes\n  $ git commit -a -m "my first commit"\n  $ git pushOne more command to make it happen in\n  Git. That extra command has large\n  implications, but for the purposes of\n  this post, that\xe2\x80\x99s all we\xe2\x80\x99re talking\n  about, one extra command.See, it really isn\xe2\x80\x99t that hard.Update: I\xe2\x80\x99d be remiss to not also mention that the equivalent of\n  updating your local copy in Subversion\n  compared to Git is svn update and\n  git pull, respectively. Only one\n  command in both cases.Install msysgitThere are several downloads:This also installs a Cygwin bash shell, so you can use the git in a nicer shell (than cmd.exe), and also includes git-gui (accessible via git gui command, or the Start > All Programs > Git menu)Use the git-osx-installer, or you can also install from sourceInstall git using your native package manager. For example, on Debian (or Ubuntu):Or on Mac OS X, via MacPorts:\xe2\x80\xa6or fink:\xe2\x80\xa6or Homebrew:On Red Hat based distributions, such as Fedora:In Cygwin the Git package can be found under the "devel" sectionIn Mac OS X, if you have the Developer Tools installed, you can compile Git from source very easily. Download the latest version of Git as a .tar.bz or .tar.gz from http://git-scm.com/, and extract it (double click in Finder)On Linux/BSD/etc. it should be much the same. For example, in Debian (and Ubuntu), you need to install the build-essential package via apt.Then in a Terminal, cd to where you extracted the files (Running cd ~/Downloads/git*/ should work), and then run..This will install Git into the default place (/usr/local - so git will be in /usr/local/bin/git)It will prompt you to enter your password (for sudo), this is so it can write to the /usr/local/ directory, which can only be accessed by the "root" user so sudo is required!If you with to install it somewhere separate (so Git\'s files aren\'t mixed in with other tools), use --prefix with the configure command:This will install the git binary into /usr/local/bin/gitpath/bin/git - so you don\'t have to type that every time you, you should add into your $PATH by adding the following line into your ~/.profile:If you do not have sudo access, you can use --prefix=/Users/myusername/bin and install into your home directory. Remember to add ~/bin/ to $PATHThe script x-git-update-to-latest-version automates a lot of this:This script updates my local clone of the git repo (localy at ~/work/track/git), and then configures, installs (at /usr/local/git-git describe) and updates the /usr/local/git symlink.This way, I can have /usr/local/git/bin in my PATH and I\'m always using the latest version.The latest version of this script also installs the man pages. You need to tweak your MANPATH to include the /usr/local/git/share/man directory.Say you make a pull, merge it into your code, and decide you don\'t like it.\nUse git-log, or tig, and find the hash of wherever you want to go back to (probably your last commit before the pull/merge) copy the hash, and do:Instead of the hash, you can use HEAD^ as a shortcut for the previous commit.How to set up a normal repository is described here -- but how do you set up a team repository that everybody can pull and push from and to?Assuming your team already has for instance a shared group membership that can be used.To start using this repository the easiest thing to do is start from a local repository you already have been using:Others can now clone this and start working:Set up a user account on the target server.  Whether you use an account with no password, an account with a password, or use authorized_keys really depend on your required level of security.  Take a look at Configuring Git over SSH for some more information.If all developers use the same account for accessing this shared repository, you do not need to use the --shared option as above.After initing the repository in the same way as above, you do the initial push like this:See the similarity with the above?  The only thing that might happen in addition is SSH asking for a password if the account has a password.  If you get this prompt on an account without a password the SSH server probably has disabled PermitEmptyPasswords.Cloning now looks like this:git status is your friend, use it often.  Good for answering questions like:Unlike, say svn status, git status runs nigh-instantly even on large projects.  I often found it reassuring while learning git to use it frequently, to make sure my mental model of what was going on was accurate.  Now I mostly just use it to remind myself what I\'ve changed since my last commit.Obviously, it\'s much more useful if your .gitignore is sanely configured.Once you\'ve edited a file, you need to commit your changes to git.  When you execute this command it will ask for a commit message - which is just a simple bit of text that tells everyone what you\'ve changed.Will commit the file main.c in the directory ./source/will commit all changed files (but not new files, those need to be added to the index with git-add). If you want to commit only certain files then you will need to stage them first with git-add and then commit without the -a flag.Commiting only changes your local repository though not the remote repositories. If you want to send the commits to the remote repository then you will need to do a push.For someone coming from CVS or SVN this is a change since the commit to the central repository now requires two steps.The default branch in a git repository is called master.   To create a new branch use  To see a list of all branches in the current repository typeIf you want to switch to another branch you can useTo create a new branch and switch to it in one stepTo delete a branch, useTo create a branch with the changes from the current branch, doThat pretty much covers every case for getting the latest copy of the code from the remote repository.The Pro Git free book is definitely my favorite, especially for beginners. Git Magic is all you\'ll ever need. Guaranteed or your money back!If you want to merge a branch (e.g. master to release), make sure your current branch is the target branch you\'d like to merge into (use git branch or git status to see your current branch).Then use(where master is the name of the branch you want to merge with the current branch).If there are any conflicts, you can useto see pending conflicts you have to resolve.I\'ve also found Git Internals to be very useful.  It is written by Scott Chacon (author of Pro Git, and maintainer of the Git Community Book).  What I like about Git Internals is it focuses on the concepts first and then the commands, and being that it is ~100 small pages it is quickly digestible.Assuming there is a remote repository that you cloned your local repository from and also assuming that there is a branch named \'some_branch\' on that remote repository, here is how to track it locally:A real good paper for understanding how Git works is The Git Parable. Very recommended!Compare command is git diff.To compare 2 revisions of a file:That diffs commit1 against commit2; if you change order then files are diffed the other way round, which may not be what you expect...To compare current staged file against the repository:To compare current unstaged file against the repository:Why yet another howto? There are really good ones on the net, like the git guide which is perfect to begin. It has good links including the git book to which one can contribute (hosted on git hub) and which is perfect for this collective task.On stackoverflow, I would really prefer to see your favorite tricks !Mine, which I discovered only lately, is git stash, explained here, which enables you to save your current job and go to another branchEDIT: as the previous post, if you really prefer stackoverlow format with posts as a wiki I will delete this answerWhile inside a git repo, type \'tig\', to view an interactive log, hit \'enter\' on any log to see more information about it. h for help, which lists the basic functionality."Tig" is "Git" backwards.Assuming that you have cloned your remote repository from some single remote repository.I got started with the official Git tutorial. I think it\'s practical enough for beginners (I was, and still am, a beginner, by your definition! I barely grasp makefiles, I\'ve only played a bit with Apache Subversion, etc.).Perform a push in your remote using : before the name of the branchbeing origin the name of your remote and mybranchname the name of the branch about to be deleted http://help.github.com/remotes/Push and pull changesIn an simplified way, just do git push and git pull. Changes are merged and if there\'s a conflict git will let you know and you can resolve it manually.When you first push to a remote repository you need to do a git push origin master (master being the master branch). From then on you just do the git push.Push tags with git push --tags.First go to an empty dir, use "git init" to make it a repository, then clone the remote repo into your own.Wherever you initially clone from is where "git pull" will pull from by default.Gity: http://macendeavor.com/gity
