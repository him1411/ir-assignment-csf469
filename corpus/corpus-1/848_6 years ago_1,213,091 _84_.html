When I try opening Eclipse, a pop-up dialog states:Failed to load the JNI shared library "C:/JDK/bin/client/jvm.dll"`.Following this, Eclipse force closes.Here\'s a few points I\'d like to make:  Downloading the 32-bit versions is something I only want to do as a very last resort.\nWhat would be suggested to solve this issue?You need a 64-bit trio: I had several JDKs and JREs installed.Each of them had their own entry in the PATH variable, all was working more or less.Judging from the PATH variables, some installations were completely useless, since they were never used. Of course, the "inactive" Javas could be referenced manually from within Eclipse if I needed, but I never did that, so I really did not need them. (At least I thought so at that time...)I cleaned up the mess, deinstalled all current Java\'s, installed only JDK + JRE 1.7 64-bit. One of the Eclipse \'installations\' failed afterwards with the Failed to Load the JNI shared Library and a given path relative to the fresh installed JDK where it thought the jvm.dll to be.The failing Eclipse was the only one of all my IDEs that was still a 32-bit version on my otherwise all-64-bit setup.Adding VM arguments, like so often mentioned, in the eclipse.ini was no use in my case (because I had only the wrong JDK/JRE to relate to.)I was also unable to find out how to check if this Eclipse was a 32-bit or 64-bit version (I could not look it up in the Task Manager, since this Eclipse \'installation\' would not start up. And since it had been a while since I had set it up, I could not remember its version either.)In case you use a newer JDK and a older JRE you might be in for trouble, too, but then it is more likely a java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError appears, IIRC.Make sure your eclipse.ini file includes the following lines.My eclipse.ini for example:Use OS and Eclipse both 64 bit or both 32 bit keep same and config eclipse.ini.Your eclipse.ini file can be found in your eclipse folder.I had same problemI resolved it by installing 64 bit JVM from http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jspAnother option is:Create a shortcut to the Eclipse.exe. Open the shortcut and change the target to:For your installation, make sure the locations point to the correct Eclipse installation directory and the correct javaw.exe installation directory. (The 64/32 bit versions of Eclipse and Java need to be the same, of course.)I have multiple versions of Java installed, both Sun JDK & JRockit, both 32 bit and 64-bit, etc. and ran into this problem with a fresh install of 64-bit Eclipse for Java EE (JUNO). 64-bit trio as suggested by Peter Rader: I\'m using 64-bit Eclipse on 64-bit OS (Windows 7). I ensured Sun JDK 7 64-bit was the default java version.  When I typed "java -version" from command line (cmd.exe), Sun JDK 7 64-bit was returned...This did not resolve the problem for me.Adding -vm option to eclipse.ini as suggested by Jayesh Kavathiya: I added the following to eclipse.ini:I did not have to uninstall any of the various versions of JDK or JRE I have on my machine.This error means that the architecture of Eclipse does not match the architecture of the Java runtime, i.e. if one is 32-bit the other must be the same, and not 64-bit.The most reliable fix is to specify the JVM location in eclipse.ini:Important: These two lines must come before -vmargs. Do not use quotes; spaces are allowed.For a missing jvm.dll file, we can provide the path of the dll file in eclipse.ini file asHere it is important to remove any space in the path and the double quotes.\nIt worked for me when i removed the quotes and space.I hope it helps someone.I had a similar problem. It was solved doing the following.I have both versions of Java installed, but Eclipse kept trying to use the 32-bit one.Sure, you need to have a compatible version of JDK and Eclipse, but you also need to add in the eclipse.ini file the below lines:Make them the first two lines of your eclipse.ini file.As many folks already alluded to, this is a 32 vs. 64 bit problem for both Eclipse and Java. You cannot mix up 32 and 64 bit. Since Eclipse doesn\'t use JAVA_HOME, you\'ll likely have to alter your PATH prior to launching Eclipse to ensure you are using not only the appropriate version of Java, but also if 32 or 64 bit (or modify the INI file as Jayath noted).  If you are installing Eclipse from a company-share, you should ensure you can tell which Eclipse version you are unzipping, and unzip to the appropriate Program Files directory to help keep track of which is which, then change the PATH (either permanently via (Windows) Control Panel -> System or set PATH=/path/to/32 or 64bit/java/bin;%PATH% (maybe create a batch file if you don\'t want to set it in your system and/or user environment variables). Remember, 32-bit is in Program files (x86).If unsure, just launch Eclipse, if you get the error, change your PATH to the other \'bit\' version of Java, and then try again. Then move the Eclipse directory to the appropriate Program Files directory.Alternatively, get the same "bit" version of JRE and Eclipse and then create a new shortcut with the below target (replace the installed JRE and Eclipse location/path):That should do the trick.You can solve that problem as many other replicated. You need that Eclipse and the JDK be 32-bits or both on 64-bits. The architecture of the OS doesn\'t matter while the others remains on the same type of arquitecture.The answers above me got me tempted so much, that I decided to dry run all the possible combinations with OS, Eclipse and JVM trio. Anyway, whoever is digging down and reading my post, check the following as a hot spot (I am WindowsÂ 7 user).You understand Program Files and Program File (x86) are two different folders... x86 stands for the 32-bit version of programs and the former is the 64-bit version.If you have multiple versions of Java installed with different bitness and release versions, which is bound to happen with so many open source IDEs, managers, administrative consoles, the best option is to set the VM argument directly in the eclipse.ini file. If you don\'t, Eclipse will go crazy and try searching itself which is not good.One of the easy ways to resolve it is to copy the jre folder from installed the JDK into the Eclipse installation folder. Make sure that JDK you copy from is the same architecture as your Eclipse installation.I had to configure my machine that way, because I run both Eclipse and Appcelerator Titanium Studio on my machine. The Studio needs 32-bit Java, while Eclipse needs 64-bit.Yes, just make sure your versions of Eclipse and JDK are both 64-bit. Just to make sure everything is correct uninstalled JDK and install it in Program Files and not in Program Files (x86). At least that resolved my problem.You should uninstall all old [JREs][1] and then install the newest one... I had the same problem and now I solve it. I\'ve:Better install Jre 6 32 bit. It really works.Downloaded 64 bit JVM from site and installed it manually and updated the system path variable. That solved the issue. Thank you misterfrb, I realised that Eclipse was giving this error, because I had just installed Oracle 10g Developer suite, and it was looking for the jvm.dll file in the C:\\DevSuiteHome_1 folder (I must have opted to install JDK again along with developer suite). After removing the DevSuiteHome lines from the paths variable and adding the correction location for 64-bit jvm.dll (not sure if this was necessary, didn\'t try without), Eclipse worked again, and Developer suite still does too.Just check the PATH environment variable. In My Computer - > Properties -> Advanced System settings -> Environment Variables -> (left upper window "User Variables for "some name of PC"" ) just check the PATH variable. If it doesn\'t exist create it with the following -- > C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7\\bin <--I was faced with the same problem after had updated my Eclipse. I\'ve found that the path asked 64-bit version, but I had the 32-bit in dif path. It was helpful for me. P.S.: I have a 64-bit OS, 32-bit JRE and 32-bit Eclipse. All works fine :)Simple, I have a 64-bit OS, 32-bit Eclipse and both JDK 32 & 64 installed... I just uninstalled the 64-bit JDK and Eclipse is working fine..I had the same issue after upgrading from Java 6 to Java 7. After I removed Java 6 (64 bit) and reinstalled Java 7 (64 bit), Eclipse worked. :)Make sure you are starting Eclipse with Administrator rights.You can install the 32-bit version of JDK on a 64-bit machine. See JDK 7 downloads.And for PDT users - avoid the Zend download page - it doesn\'t have any 64-bit downloads linked.Use the Elipse site itself.The above link had an older 3.6 Eclipse which then failed to update itself due to Eclipse Bug #317785.My solution was to just install 32-bit Java alongside 64-bit - this allowed the Zend installer to work.It\'s depressing that amount of Java / Eclipse cruft one has to go through to get a PHP IDE.If you use whole 64-bit trio and it still doesn\'t work (I\'ve come to this problem while launching Android Monitor in Intellij Idea), probably wrong jvm.dll is being used opposed to what your java expects. Just follow these steps:Find the jvm.dll in your JRE directory:\nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre7\\server\\bin\\jvm.dllFind the jvm.dll in your JDK directory:\nc:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_xx\\jre\\bin\\server\\Copy the jvm.dll from JRE drectory into your JDK directory and overwrite the jvm.dll in JDK.Don\'t forget to make a backup, just in case. No need to install or uninstall anything related to Java.The same occurred to me. I had 64-bit Eclipse, but my JDK was 32-bit. So I installed the 64-bit version and it\'s OK right now.It is crucial to add the -vm parameter and its value on 2 lines AT THE BEGINNING of the eclipse.ini-vm\nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_45\\bin\\javaw.exeI\'m not sure why but I had the jre installed into my c:\\windows directory and java.exe and javaw.exe inside my windows\\system32 directory.Obviously these directories were getting priority even AFTER adding the -vm flag to my eclipse.ini file.Delete them from here fixed the issue for me.You have change proper version of the JAVA_HOME and PATH in environmental variables.
