I have an array that is initialized like:I would like to convert this array into an object of the ArrayList class.Given:The simplest answer is to do:This will work fine.  But some caveats:(old thread, but just 2 cents as none mention Guava or other libs and some other details)It\'s worth pointing out the Guava way, which greatly simplifies these shenanigans:Use the ImmutableList class and its of() and copyOf() factory methods (elements can\'t be null):Use the Lists class and its newArrayList() factory methods:Please also note the similar methods for other data structures in other classes, for instance in Sets.The main attraction could be to reduce the clutter due to generics for type-safety, as the use of the Guava factory methods allow the types to be inferred most of the time. However, this argument holds less water since Java 7 arrived with the new diamond operator.But it\'s not the only reason (and Java 7 isn\'t everywhere yet): the shorthand syntax is also very handy, and the methods initializers, as seen above, allow to write more expressive code. You do in one Guava call what takes 2 with the current Java Collections.Use the JDK\'s Arrays class and its asList() factory method, wrapped with a Collections.unmodifiableList():Note that the returned type for asList() is a List using a concrete ArrayList implementation, but it is NOT java.util.ArrayList. It\'s an inner type, which emulates an ArrayList but actually directly references the passed array and makes it "write through" (modifications are reflected in the array).It forbids modifications through some of the List API\'s methods by way of simply extending an AbstractList (so, adding or removing elements is unsupported), however it allows calls to set() to override elements. Thus this list isn\'t truly immutable and a call to asList() should be wrapped with Collections.unmodifiableList().See the next step if you need a mutable list.Same as above, but wrapped with an actual java.util.ArrayList:Since this question is pretty old, it surprises me that nobody suggested the simplest form yet:As of Java 5, Arrays.asList() takes a varargs parameter and you don\'t have to construct the array explicitly.Make sure that myArray is the same type as T. You\'ll get a compiler error if you try to create a List<Integer> from an array of int, for example.Another way (although essentially equivalent to the new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(array)) solution performance-wise:You probably just need a List, not an ArrayList.  In that case you can just do:Another update, almost ending year 2014, you can do it with Java 8 too:A few characters would be saved, if this could be just a List To convert an array to an ArrayList, developers often do this:Arrays.asList() will return an ArrayList which is a private static class inside Arrays, it is not the java.util.ArrayList class. The java.util.Arrays.ArrayList class has set(), get(), contains() methods, but does not have any methods for adding elements, so its size is fixed. \nTo create a real ArrayList, you must do:The constructor of ArrayList can accept a Collection type, which is also a super type for java.util.Arrays.ArrayListIn Java 9, you can use List.of static factory method in order to create a List literal. Something like the following:This would return an immutable list containing three elements. If you want a mutable list, pass that list to the ArrayList constructor:JEP 269 provides some convenience factory methods for Collections API. This factory methods are not in current Java version, which is 8, but are planned for Java 9 release. You can try out this feature using JDK 9 Early Access.If you use :you may create and fill two lists ! Filling twice a big list is exactly what you don\'t want to do because it will create another Object[] array each time the capacity needs to be extended.Fortunately the JDK implementation is fast and Arrays.asList(a[]) is very well done. It create a kind of ArrayList named Arrays.ArrayList where the Object[] data points directly to the array.The dangerous side is that if you change the initial array, you change the List ! Are you sure you want that ? Maybe yes, maybe not.If not, the most understandable way is to do this :Or as said @glglgl, you can create another independant ArrayList with :I love to use Collections, Arrays, or Guava. But if it don\'t fit, or you don\'t feel it, just write another inelegant line instead.According with the question the answer using java 1.7 is:However it\'s better always use the interface:You can convert using different methodsList<Element> list = Arrays.asList(array);List<Element> list = new ArrayList();\nCollections.addAll(list, array);Arraylist list = new Arraylist();\nlist.addAll(Arrays.asList(array));For more detail you can refer to http://javarevisited.blogspot.in/2011/06/converting-array-to-arraylist-in-java.htmlYou also can do it with stream in Java 8.If we see the definition of Arrays.asList() method you will get something like this: So, you might initialize arraylist like this: Note : each new Element(int args) will be treated as Individual Object and can be passed as a var-args.There might be another answer for this question too.\nIf you see declaration for java.util.Collections.addAll() method you will get something like this:So, this code is also useful to do soIn Java 9 you can use:Since Java 8 there is easier way to transform:Another simple way is to add all elements from the array to a new ArrayList using a for-each loop.and the common newest way to create array is observableArraysthus the answer is that is according to Oracle DocsobservableArrayList()\n  Creates a new empty observable list that is backed by an arraylist.\n  observableArrayList(E... items)\n  Creates a new observable array list with items added to it.Given:Use:Even though there are many perfectly written answers to this question, I will add my inputs. Say you have Element[] array = { new Element(1), new Element(2), new Element(3) };New ArrayList can be created in the following waysAnd they very well support all operations of ArrayListBut the following operations returns just a List view of an ArrayList and not actual ArrayList.Therefore, they will give error when trying to make some ArrayList operationsMore on List representation of array link.Simplest way to do so is by adding following code. Tried and Tested.We can easily convert an array to ArrayList.\nWe use Collection interface\'s addAll() method for the purpose of copying content from one list to another. Already everyone has provided enough good answer for your problem. \nNow from the all suggestions, you need to decided which will fit your requirement. There are two types of collection which you need to know. One is unmodified collection and other one collection which will allow you to modify the object later.So, Here I will give short example for two use cases.Immutable collection creation :: When you don\'t want to modify the collection object after creationList<Element> elementList = Arrays.asList(array)Mutable collection creation :: When you may want to modify the created collection object after creation.List<Element> elementList = new ArrayList<Element>(Arrays.asList(array));You can do it in java 8 as followsAnother Java8 solution (I may have missed the answer among the large set. If so, my apologies). This creates an ArrayList (as opposed to a List) i.e. one can delete elementsOutput is... \nHello \nworldYou can create an ArrayList using Cactoos (I\'m one of the developers):There is no guarantee that the object will actually be of class ArrayList. If you need that guarantee, do this:If the array is of a primitive type, the given answers won\'t work. But since Java 8 you can use:
