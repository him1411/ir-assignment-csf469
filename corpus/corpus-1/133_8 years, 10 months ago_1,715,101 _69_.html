What\'s the difference between the list methods append() and extend()?append: Appends object at end.gives you: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]extend: Extends list by appending elements from the iterable.gives you: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]append adds an element to a list, extend concatenates the first list with another list (or another iterable not necessarily a list.)From Dive into Python.And in this context it can also be good to remember that strings are also iterable.The list.append method appends an object to the end of the list.Whatever the object is, whether a number, a string, another list, or something else, it gets added onto the end of my_list as a single entry on the list. So keep in mind that a list is an object. If you append another list onto a list, the first list will be a single object at the end of the list (which may not be what you want):The list.extend method extends a list by appending elements from an iterable:So with extend, each element of the iterable gets appended onto the list. For example:Keep in mind that a string is an iterable, so if you extend a list with a string, you\'ll append each character as you iterate over the string (which may not be what you want):Both + and += operators are defined for list. They are semantically similar to extend.my_list + another_list creates a third list in memory, so you can return the result of it, but it requires that the second iterable be a list. my_list += another_list modifies the list in-place (it is the in-place operator, and lists are mutable objects, as we\'ve seen) so it does not create a new list. It also works like extend, in that the second iterable can be any kind of iterable.Don\'t get confused - my_list = my_list + another_list is not equivalent to += - it gives you a brand new list assigned to my_list.Append has constant time complexity, O(1). Extend has time complexity, O(k). Iterating through the multiple calls to append adds to the complexity, making it equivalent to that of extend, and since extend\'s iteration is implemented in C, it will always be faster if you intend to append successive items from an iterable onto a listYou may wonder what is more performant, since append can be used to achieve the same outcome as extend. The following functions do the same thing:So let\'s time them:We see that extend can run much faster than append, and it is semantically clearer, so it is preferred when you intend to append each element in an iterable to a list. If you only have a single element to add to the list, use append.append appends a single element. extend appends a list of elements.Note that if you pass a list to append, it still adds one element:The following two snippets are semantically equivalent:andThe latter may be faster as the loop is implemented in C.You can use "+" for returning extend, instead of extending in place.Similarly += for in place behavior, but with slight differences from append & extend. One of the biggest differences of += from append and extend is when it is used in function scopes, see this blog post.The append() method adds a single item to the end of the list. The extend() method takes one argument, a list, and appends each of the items of the argument to the original list. (Lists are implemented as classes. \xe2\x80\x9cCreating\xe2\x80\x9d a list is really instantiating a class. As such, a list has methods that operate on it.)From Dive Into Pythonappend(object) - Updates the list by adding an object to the list.extend(list) - Essentially concatenates 2 lists.extend() can be used with an iterator argument. Here is an example. You wish to make a list out of a list of lists this way:fromyou wantYou may use itertools.chain.from_iterable() to do so. This method\'s output is an iterator. It\'s implementation is equivalent toBack to our example, we can do and get the wanted list.Here is how equivalently extend() can be used with an iterator argument:This is the equivalent of append and extend using the + operator:An interesting point that has been hinted, but not explained, is that extend is faster than append. For any loop that has append inside should be considered to be replaced by list.extend(processed_elements).Bear in mind that apprending new elements might result in the realloaction of the whole list to a better location in memory. If this is done several times because we are appending 1 element at a time, overall performance suffers. In this sense, list.extend is analogous to "".join(stringlist).append(): It is basically used in Python to add one element.Example 1:Example 2:extend(): Where extend(), is used to merge two lists or insert multiple elements in one list.Example 1:Example 2:Append adds the entire data at once. The whole data will be added to the newly created index. On the other hand, extend, as it name suggests, extends the current array. For exampleWith append we get:While on extend we get:append:output : [1,2,3,4,5,["a","b","c","d","e"]]extend :output : [1,2,3,4,5,"a","b","c","d","e"]I hope I can make a useful supplement to this question. If your list stores a specific type object, for example Info, here is a situation that extend method is not suitable: In a for loop and and generating an Info object every time and using extend to store it into your list, it will fail. The exception is like below:TypeError: \'Info\' object is not iterableBut if you use the append method, the result is OK. Because every time using the extend method, it will always treat it as a list or any other collection type, iterate it, and place it after the previous list. A specific object can not be iterated, obviously.The method "append" adds its parameter as a single element to the list, while "extend" gets a list and adds its content.for example,  extendappend extend(L) extends the list by appending all the items in the given list L.
