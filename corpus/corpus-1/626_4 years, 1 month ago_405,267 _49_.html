I\'m seeing error messages about a file, min.map, being not found:GET jQuery\'s jquery-1.10.2.min.map is triggering a 404 (Not Found)Where is this coming from?If Chrome DevTools is reporting a 404 for a .map file (maybe jquery-1.10.2.min.map, jquery.min.map or jquery-2.0.3.min.map, but can happen with anything) first thing to know is this is only requested when using the DevTools. \nYour users will not be hitting this 404.Now you can fix this or disable the sourcemap functionality. Next, it\'s an easy fix. Head to http://jquery.com/download/ and click the Download the map file link for your version, and you\'ll want the uncompressed file downloaded as well.Having the map file in place allows you do debug your minified jQuery via the original sources, which will save a lot of time and frustration if you don\'t like dealing with variable names like a and c. More about sourcemaps here: An Introduction to JavaScript Source MapsInstead of getting the files, you can alternatively disable JavaScript source maps completely for now, in your settings. This is a fine choice if you never plan on debugging JavaScript on this page.\nUse the cog icon in the bottom right of the DevTools, to open settings, then:\nYou can remove the 404 by removing the linefrom the top part of your jQuery file.The top part of the jQuery file will look like this.Just change that toBasically it\'s a way to map a combined/minified file back to an unbuilt state. When you build for production, along with minifying and combining your JavaScript files, you generate a source map which holds information about your original files. When you query a certain line and column number in your generated JavaScript you can do a lookup in the source map which returns the original location. Developer tools (currently WebKit nightly builds, Google Chrome, or Firefox 23+) can parse the source map automatically and make it appear as though you\'re running unminified and uncombined files. \n(Read more on this here)As it is announced in jQuery 1.11.0/2.1.0 Beta 2 Released the source map comment will be removed so the issue will not appear in newer  versions of jQuery.Here is the official announcement:One of the changes we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in this beta is to remove the sourcemap\n  comment. Sourcemaps have proven to be a very problematic and puzzling\n  thing to developers, generating scores of confused questions on forums\n  like StackOverflow and causing users to think jQuery itself was\n  broken.Anyway, if you need to use a source map, it still be available:We\xe2\x80\x99ll still be generating and distributing sourcemaps, but you will\n  need to add the appropriate sourcemap comment at the end of the\n  minified file if the browser does not support manually associating map\n  files (currently, none do). If you generate your own jQuery file using\n  the custom build process, the sourcemap comment will be present in the\n  minified file and the map is generated; you can either leave it in and\n  use sourcemaps or edit it out and ignore the map file entirely.Here you can find more details about the changes.Here you can find confirmation that with the jQuery 1.11.0/2.1.0 Released the source-map comment in the minified file is removed.Download the map file and the uncompressed version of jQuery. Put them with the minified version:\nInclude minified version into your HTML:\nCheck in Google Chrome:\nRead Introduction to JavaScript Source MapsGet familiar with Debugging JavaScriptThe new versions of jQuery require this file http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.mapThe usability of this file is described here http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/Update:jQuery 1.11.0/2.1.0// sourceMappingURL comment is not included in the compressed file.As I understand the browser, Chrome at least, it doesn\'t disable the source mapping by default. That means your application\'s users will trigger this source-mapping request by default.You can remove the source mapping by deleting the //@ sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map from your JavaScript file.After following the instructions in the other answers, I needed to strip the version from the map file for this to work for me.Example: Rename jquery-1.9.1.min.maptojquery.min.map If you want to get source map file different version, you can use this link \nhttp://code.jquery.com/jquery-x.xx.x.min.mapInstead x.xx.x put your version number.Note: Some links, which you get on this method, may be broken :)I was presented with the same issue. The cause for me was Grunt concatenating my JavaScript file.I was using a ;\\n as a separator which caused the path to the source map to 404.So dev tools was looking for jquery.min.map; instead of jquery.min.map.I know that isn\'t the answer to the original question, but I am sure there are others out there with a similar Grunt configuration.jQuery 1.11.0/2.1.0 the // sourceMappingURL comment is not included in the compressed file.Assuming you\'ve checked the file is actually present on the server, this could also be caused by your web server restricting which file types are served:
