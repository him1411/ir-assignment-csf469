When trying to delete a key from a dictionary, I write:Is there a one line way of doing this?Use dict.pop():This will return my_dict[key] if key exists in the dictionary, and None otherwise. If the second parameter is not specified (ie. my_dict.pop(\'key\')) and key does not exist, a KeyError is raised.Specifically to answer "is there a one line way of doing this?"...well, you asked ;-)You should consider, though, that this way of deleting an object from a dict is not atomic\xe2\x80\x94it is possible that \'key\' may be in myDict during the if statement, but may be deleted before del is executed, in which case del will fail with a KeyError.  Given this, it would be safest to either use dict.pop or something along the lines ofwhich, of course, is definitely not a one-liner.It took me some time to figure out what exactly my_dict.pop("key", None) is doing. So I\'ll add this as an answer to save others googling time:pop(key[, default])If key is in the dictionary, remove it and return its value, else\n  return default. If default is not given and key is not in the \n  dictionary, a KeyError is raisedDocumentationTiming of the three solutions described above.Small dictionary:Larger dictionary:If you need to remove a lot of keys from a dictionary in one line of code, I think using map() is quite succinct and pythonic readable: And if you need to catch errors where you pop a value that isn\'t in the dictionary, use lambda inside map() like this:Works. and \'e\' did not cause an error, even there myDict did not have an \'e\' key.Another way You can delete by conditions.\nNo error if key doesn\'t exist
