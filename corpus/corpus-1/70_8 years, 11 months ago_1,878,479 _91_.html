How can I get a timestamp in JavaScript?Something similar to Unix\'s timestamp, that is, a single number that represents the current time and date. Either as a number or a string.Short & Snazzy:A unary operator like plus triggers the valueOf method in the Date object and it returns the timestamp (without any alteration).Details:On almost all current browsers you can use Date.now() to get the UTC timestamp in milliseconds; a notable exception to this is IE8 and earlier (see compatibility table).You can easily make a shim for this, though:To get the timestamp in seconds, you can use:Or alternatively you could use:Which should be slightly faster, but also less readable (also see this answer).I would recommend using Date.now() (with compatibility shim). It\'s slightly better because it\'s shorter & doesn\'t create a new Date object. However, if you don\'t want a shim & maximum compatibility, you could use the "old" method to get the timestamp in milliseconds:Which you can then convert to seconds like this:And you can also use the valueOf method which we showed above:I like this, because it is small:I also like this, because it is just as short and is compatible with modern browsers, and over 357 people voted that it\'s better: JavaScript works with the number of milliseconds since the epoch whereas most other languages work with the seconds. You could work with milliseconds but as soon as you pass a value to say PHP, the PHP native functions will probably fail. So to be sure I always use the seconds, not milliseconds.This will give you a Unix timestamp (in seconds):This will give you the milliseconds since the epoch (not Unix timestamp):I provide multiple solutions with descriptions in this answer.\nfeel free to ask questions if anything is unclear\nps: sadly someone merged this to the top answer without giving credit.Quick and Dirty solution:Warning: it might break in 2038 and return negative numbers if you do the |0 magic.   use Math.floor() instead by that timeMath.floor() solution:some nerdy alternative by Derek \xe6\x9c\x95\xe6\x9c\x83\xe5\x8a\x9f\xe5\xa4\xab taken from the comments below this answer:Polyfill to get Date.now() working:to get it working in IE you could do this (Polyfill from MDN):if you do not care about the year / day of week / daylight saving time you could strip it away and use this after 2038: some output of how it will look:of course it will break daylight saving time but depending on what you\n  are building this might be usefull to you if you need to do binary\n  operations on timestamps after int32 will break in 2038this will also return negative values but only if the user of that pc\n  you are running your code on is changing his pc\'s clock at least to\n  31th of december of the previous year.if you just want to know the relative time from the point of when the code was run through first you could use something like this:in case you are using jQuery you could use $.now() as described in jQuery\'s Docs wich makes the Polyfill obsolete since they are doing the same: (new Date).getTime()if you are just happy about jQuery\'s version consider upvoting this answer since i did not find it myself.now a tiny explaination of what |0 does:by providing | you tell the interpreter to do a binary OR operation.\nbit operations require absolute numbers wich turns the decimal result from Date.now() / 1000 into an absolut number.\nduring that convertion, decimals are just removed, resulting in the same result as using Math.floor() but using less code.be warned though: it will convert a 64 bit double to a 32 bit integer.\n  this will result in informationloss when dealing with huge numbers.\n  timestamps will break after 2038 due to a int32 overflow.for further information about Date.now follow this Link: Date.now() @ MDNjQuery provides its own method to get the timestamp:(besides it just implements (new Date).getTime() expression)REF: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.now/Just to add up, here\'s a function to return a timestamp string in Javascript. \nExample: 15:06:38 PMone i haven\'t seen yet another one i haven\'t seen yet isorthen The Date.getTime() method can be used with a little tweak:The value returned by the getTime method is the number of milliseconds\n  since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC.Divide the result by 1000 to get the Unix timestamp, floor if necessary:The Date.valueOf() method is functionally equivalent to Date.getTime(), which makes it possible to use arithmetic operators on date object to achieve identical results. In my opinion, this approach affects readability.In addition to the other options, if you want a dateformat ISO, you get can get it directlyHere is a simple function to generate timestamp in the format: mm/dd/yy hh:mi:ss The code Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000) can be shortened to new Date / 1E3 | 0.Consider to skip direct getTime() invocation and use | 0 as a replacement for Math.floor() function.\nIt\'s also good to remember 1E3 is a shorter equivalent for 1000 (uppercase E is preferred than lowercase to indicate 1E3 as a constant).As a result you get the following:For a timestamp with microsecond resolution, there\'s performance.now:This could for example yield 1436140826653.139, while Date.now only gives 1436140826653.I highly recommend using moment.js. To get the number of milliseconds since UNIX epoch, do To get the number of seconds since UNIX epoch, doYou can also convert times like so:I do that all the time. No pun intended.To use moment.js in the browser:For more details, including other ways of installing and using MomentJS, see their docsYou can only use to get the current timestamp. No need to do anything extra.Any browsers not supported Date.now, you can use this for get current date time:This one has a solution : which converts unixtime stamp to tim in js try thisIf want a basic way to generate a timestamp in Node.js this works well.Our team is using this to bust cache in a localhost environment. The output is /dist/css/global.css?v=245521377 where 245521377 is the timestamp generated by hrtime(). Hopefully this helps, the methods above can work as well but I found this to be the simplest approach for our needs in Node.js.I learned a really cool way of converting a given Date object to a Unix timestamp from the source code of JQuery Cookie the other day.Here\'s an example:For lodash and underscore users, use _.now.This seems to work.Date native object in JavaScript is the way we get all data about time.\nJust be careful in JavaScript the timestamp is depends on the client computer setting, so it\'s not 100% accurate timestamp. For getting the best result, you need to get the timestamp from the server-side. Anyway, my preferred way is using vanilla. This is a common way of doing it in JavaScript:In MDN it\'s mentioned as below:The Date.now() method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since\n  1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC.\n  Because now() is a static method of Date, you always use it as Date.now().If you using a version below ES5, Date.now(); not works and you need to use:Moment.js can abstract away a lot of the pain in dealing with Javascript Dates. See: http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/unix-timestamp/more simpler way:The advised, proper way is Number(new Date()), \nin terms of code- readability,Also, UglifyJS and Google-Closure-Compiler will lower the complexity of the parsed code-logic-tree (relevant if you are using one of them to obscure/minify your code). for Unix timestamp, which has a lower time resolution,  just divide current number with 1000, keeping the whole. sometime I need it in objects for xmlhttp calls, so I do like this.var my_timestamp = ~~(Date.now()/1000);
