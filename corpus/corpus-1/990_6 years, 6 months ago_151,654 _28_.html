gives me : Key Error: Hello\\\\I want to print the output: {Hello} 42You need to double the {{ and }}:Here\'s the relevant part of the Python documentation for format string syntax:Format strings contain \xe2\x80\x9creplacement fields\xe2\x80\x9d surrounded by curly braces {}. Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal text, which is copied unchanged to the output. If you need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: {{ and }}.You escape it by doubling the braces.Eg:Try doing this:Try this:x = "{{ Hello }} {0}"The OP wrote this comment:It\'s pretty common that the "escaping braces" issue comes up when dealing with JSON.I suggest doing this:It\'s cleaner than the alternative, which is:Using the json library is definitely preferable when the JSON string gets more complicated than the example.Although not any better, just for the reference, you can also do this:It can be useful for example when someone wants to print {argument}. It is maybe more readable than \'{{{}}}\'.format(\'argument\')Note that you omit argument positions (e.g. {} instead of {0}) after Python 2.7If you are going to be doing this a lot, it might be good to define a utility function that will let you use arbitrary brace substitutes instead, likeNote that this will work either with brackets being a string of length 2 or an iterable of two strings (for multi-character delimiters). Reason is , {} is the syntax of .format() so in your case .format() doesn\'t recognize {Hello} so it threw an error.you can override it by using double curly braces {{}},  or try %s for text formatting,If you have to put braces around a value of a key of the parameter dictionaries or lists of the format method, try the following:Best solution for me is to use this\n\'{ob} Hello {cb} 42\'.format(ob=\'{\',cb=\'}\') The reason why because good luck using accepted answer to print something like below.Output:
