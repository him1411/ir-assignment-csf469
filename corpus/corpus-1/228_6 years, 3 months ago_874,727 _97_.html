I got an error while running my Android project for RssReader. Code:And it shows the below error:How can I fix this issue?This exception is thrown when an application attempts to perform a networking operation on its main thread. Run your code in AsyncTask:How to execute the task:In MainActivity.java file you can add this line within your oncreate() methodDon\'t forget to add this to AndroidManifest.xml file:You should almost always run network operations on a thread or as an asynchronous task. But if you know better and are willing to accept the consequences, and must do network operations on the main thread, you can override the default behavior:Add:In your class,andADD this permission in android manifest.xml file: \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Consequences:Your app will (in areas of spotty internet connection) become unresponsive and lock up, the user perceives slowness and has to do a force kill, and you risk the activity manager killing your app and telling the user that the app has stopped.Android has some good tips on good programming practices to design for responsiveness:\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/NetworkOnMainThreadException.htmlI solved this problem using a new Thread.You cannot perform network I/O on the UI thread on Honeycomb. Technically, it is possible on earlier versions of Android, but it is a really bad idea as it will cause your app to stop responding, and can result in the OS killing your app for being badly behaved. You\'ll need to run a background process or use AsyncTask to perform your network transaction on a background thread.There is an article about Painless Threading on the Android developer site which is a good introduction to this, and it will provide you with a much better depth of an answer than can be realistically provided here.The accepted answer has some significant down-sides. It is not advisable to use AsyncTask for networking unless you really know what you are doing. Some of the down-sides include:If you want to avoid short-term memory leaks, have well defined execution characteristics across all platforms, and have a base to build really robust network handling, you might want to consider:Down-sides:Up-sides:You can implement an IntentService to perform downloads on a single background thread quite easily.Step 1: Create an IntentService to perform the download. You can tell it what to download via Intent extra\'s, and pass it a PendingIntent to use to return the result to the Activity:Step 2: Register the service in the manifest:Step 3: Invoke the service from the Activity, passing a PendingResult object which the Service will use to return the result:Step 4: Handle the result in onActivityResult:A github project containing a complete working Android-Studio/gradle project is available here.Use Service or AsyncTaskSee also StackÂ Overflow question:android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException sending an email from AndroidDo the network actions on another threadFor Example:And add this to AndroidManifest.xml    You disable the strict mode using following code:This is not recommended: use the AsyncTask interface.Full code for both the methodsNetwork-based operations cannot be run on the main thread. You need to run all network-based tasks on a child thread or implement AsyncTask.This is how you run a task in a child thread:Put your code inside:Or:Using Android Annotations is an option. It will allow you to simply run any method in a background thread:Note, that although it provides benefits of simplicity and readability, it has its disadvantages. This happens in Android 3.0 and above. From Android 3.0 and above, they have restricted using network operations (functions that access the Internet) from running in the main thread/UI thread (what spawns from your on create and on resume methods in the activity).This is to encourage using separate threads for network operations. See AsyncTask for more details on how to perform network activities the right way.You should not do any time-consuming task on the main thread (UI thread), like any network operation, file I/O, or SQLite database operations. So for this kind of operation, you should create a worker thread, but the problem is that you can not directly perform any UI related operation from your worker thread. For that, you have to use Handler and pass the Message. To simplify all these things, Android provides various ways, like AsyncTask, AsyncTaskLoader, CursorLoader or IntentService. So you can use any of these according to your requirements.The top answer of spektom works perfect.If you are writing the AsyncTask inline and not extending as a class, and on top of this, if there is a need to get a response out of the AsyncTask, one can use the get() method as below.(From his example.)The error is due to executing long running operations in main thread,You can easily rectify the problem by using AsynTask or Thread. You can checkout this library AsyncHTTPClient for better handling. This is only thrown for applications targeting the Honeycomb SDK or higher. Applications targeting earlier SDK versions are allowed to do networking on their main event loop threads.The error is the SDK warning!For me it was this:The device I was testing my app on was 4.1.2 which is SDK Version 16!Make the sure the target version is the same as your Android Target Library. If you are unsure what your target library is, right click your Project -> Build Path -> Android, and it should be the one that is ticked.Also, as others have mentioned, include the correct permissions to access the Internet:Just to spell out something explicitly:The main thread is basically the UI thread.So saying that you cannot do networking operations in the main thread means you cannot do networking operations in the UI thread, which means you cannot do networking operations in a *runOnUiThread(new Runnable() { ... }* block inside some other thread, either.(I just had a long head-scratching moment trying to figure out why I was getting that error somewhere other than my main thread.  This was why; this thread helped; and hopefully this comment will help someone else.)This exception occurs due to any heavy task performed on the main thread if that performing task takes too much time.To avoid this, we can handle it using threads or executersIn simple words,DO NOT DO NETWORK WORK IN THE UI THREADFor example, if you do an HTTP request, that is a network action.Solution:Way:Put all your works insideBut:When you get something from Network response and want to show it on your view (like display response message in TextView), you need to return back to the UI thread.If you don\'t do it, you will get ViewRootImpl$CalledFromWrongThreadException.How to?Although above there is a huge solution pool, no one mentioned com.koushikdutta.ion: https://github.com/koush/ionIt\'s also asynchronous and very simple to use:This works. Just made Dr.Luiji\'s answer a little simpler.We can also use RxJava to move network operations to a background thread. And it\'s fairly simple as well.You can do a lot more stuff with RxJava.Here are some links for RxJava. Feel free to dig in. RxJava Async task in Androidhttp://blog.stablekernel.com/replace-asynctask-asynctaskloader-rx-observable-rxjava-android-patterns/On Android, network operations cannot be run on the main thread. You can use Thread, AsyncTask (short-running tasks), Service (long-running tasks) to do network operations.Accessing network resources from the main (UI) thread cause this exception. Use a separate thread or AsyncTask for accessing a network resource to avoid this problem.You can also resolve this issue by using Strict Mode using the below code. It\'s also an alternative to resolving this issue.But the best practice would be to use AsyncTask.I solved this problem in a simple way...I added after oncreate StrictMode.enableDefaults(); and solved this.Oruse Service or AsyncTask to solve thisNote:For more, check this.You are not allowed to implement network operations on the UI thread on Android. You will have to use AsyncTask class to perform network related operations like sending API request, downloading image from a URL, etc. and using callback methods of AsyncTask, you can get you result in onPostExecute menthod and you will be in the UI thread and you can populate UI with data from web service or something like that.Example: Suppose you want to download image from an URL: https://www.samplewebsite.com/sampleimage.jpgSolution using AsyncTask:\n are  respectively.Note: Do not forget to add the Internet permission in the Android manifest file. It will work like a charm. :)This exception is thrown when an application attempts to perform a networking operation on its main thread.\nIf your task took above five seconds, it takes a force close.Run your code in AsyncTask:
