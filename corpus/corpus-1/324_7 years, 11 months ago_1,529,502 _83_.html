How do I get current date in JavaScript?Use new Date() to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time.This will give you today\'s date in the format of mm/dd/yyyy.Simply change today = mm +\'/\'+ dd +\'/\'+ yyyy; to whatever format you wish.Use the replace option if you\'re going to reuse the utc variable, such as new Date(utc), as Firefox and Safari don\'t recognize a date with dashes.UPDATED!, Scroll DownIf you want something simple pretty to the end user ... Also, fixed a small suffix issue in the first version below. Now properly returns suffix.UBBER UPDATE After much procrastination, I\'ve finally GitHubbed and updated this with the final solution I\'ve been using for myself. It\'s even had some last minute edits to make it sweeter! If you\'re looking for the old jsFiddle, please see this.This update comes in 2 flavors, still relatively small, though not as small as my above, original answer. If you want extremely small, go with that.  Also Note: This is still less bloated than moment.js. While moment.js is nice, imo, it has to many secular methods, which require learning moment as if it were a language. Mine here uses the same common format as PHP:date.Flavor 1 new Date().format(String)\n  My Personal Fav. I know the taboo, but works great on the Date Object. Just be aware of any other mods you may have to the Date Object.Flavor 2 dateFormat(Date, String)\n  More traditional all-in-one method. Has all the ability of the previous, but is called via method with Date param.BONUS Flavor (requires jQuery) $.date(Date, String)\n  This contains much more than just a simple format option. It extends the base Date object and includes methods such as addDays. For more information, please see the Git.In this mod, the format characters are inspired by PHP:date. For a complete list, please see my READMEThis mod also has a much longer list of pre-made formats. To use a premade format, simply enter its key name. dateFormat(new Date(), \'pretty-a\');As you may notice, you can use double \\ to escape a character.If you just want a date without time info, use:Try this:The result will be likeIf you\'re looking for a lot more granular control over the date formats, I thoroughly recommend  checking out momentjs. Terrific library - and only 5KB.\nhttp://momentjs.com/You can use moment.js: http://momentjs.com/To break it down into steps:(new Date()).toString() gives "Fri Jun 28 2013 15:30:18 GMT-0700 (PDT)"(new Date()).toString().split(\' \') divides the above string on each space and returns an array as follows: ["Fri", "Jun", "28", "2013", "15:31:14", "GMT-0700", "(PDT)"](new Date()).toString().split(\' \').splice(1,3).join(\' \') takes the second, third and fourth values from the above array, joins them with spaces, and returns a string "Jun 28 2013"Also, you can call method toLocaleDateString with two parameters:Article on MSDN. More about this method on MDN.This works every time:The shortest possible:It returns "2016-03-10"You can use Date.js library which extens Date object, thus you can have .today() method.Cleaner, simpler version:Result varies according to the user\'s locale:2/27/2017, 9:15:41 AMYou can get the current date call the static method now like this:reference:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/nowVarun\'s answer does not account for TimezoneOffset. Here is a version that does:The TimezoneOffset is minutes, while the Date constructor takes milliseconds, thus the multiplication by 60000.If you want a simple DD/MM/YYYY format, I\'ve just come up with this simple solution, although it doesn\'t prefix missing zeros.Result:"Wed Feb 03 2016"would work tooYou can use thisThe HTML isIf you are using jQuery. Try this one liner :Here is the convention for formatting the date Here is the reference for jQuery datepickerYou can checkout thisAnd see the documentation for Date() constructor.\nlinkWhat\'s the big deal with this..   The cleanest way to do this is var currentDate=new Date().toLocaleString().slice(0,10);A one-line JS solution: tl;dr\n  var todaysDate =\xc2\xa0new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleString().slice(0,3).match(/[0-9]/i) ? new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleString().split(\' \')[0].split(\',\')[0] : new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleString().split(\' \')[1] + " " + new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleString().split(\' \')[2] + " " + new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleString().split(\' \')[3];\n  edge, ff latest, & chrome return todaysDate = "2/7/2017" "works"* in IE10+EDIT 2/7/2017I found out that IE10 and IE Edge do things a bit differently.. go figure.\nwith new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleString() as input,IE10 returns: I could write a big long function and FTFY. But you really ought to use moment.js for this stuff. My script merely cleans this up and gives you the expanded traditional US notation: > todaysDate = "March 06, 2017"IE EDGE returns:Of course it couldn\'t be that easy. Edge\'s date string has invisible "\xe2\x80\xa2" characters between each visible one. So not only will we now be checking if the first character is a number, but the first 3 characters, since it turns out that any single character in the whole date range\xc2\xa0will eventually be a dot or a slash at some point. So to keep things simple, just .slice() the first three chars (tiny buffer against future shenanigans) and then check for numbers. It should probably be noted that these invisible dots could potentially persist in your code. I\'d maybe dig into that if you\'ve got bigger plans than just printing this string to your view.\xe2\x88\xb4 updated one-liner:That sucks to read. How about:ORIGINAL ANSWERI\'ve got a one-liner for you:and [1] will give you the time of day.I think this is an old question but the easiest way would be the following:This will grab the current time, pass it to a string based on location and then you can call the function CurrentTime to display the time.  This would be, to me, the most effective way to get a time stamp for something.I don\'t know if it will help anyone, but I\'m using this to get today Date object.This may help youThis will print current date in dd/MM/yyyy formatPretty Print The Date Like This.June 1st, 2015 11:36:48 AMhttps://gist.github.com/Gerst20051/7d72693f722bbb0f6b582.39KB minified.
