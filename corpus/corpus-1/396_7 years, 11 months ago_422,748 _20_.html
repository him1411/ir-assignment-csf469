I have a bunch of commits in the repo. I want to see a list of files changed between two commits - from SHA1 to SHA2.What command should I use? where you only need to include enough of the SHA to identify the commits. You can also do, for exampleto see the differences between the tenth latest commit and the fifth latest (or so).is like --name-only, except you get a simple prefix telling you what happened to the file (modified, deleted, added...)is similar, but commits are listed after the commit message, so you can see when a file was changed.if you\'re interested in just what happened to certain files/folders you can append -- <filename> [<filename>...] to the git log version.if you want to see what happened for a single commit, call it SHA1, then do\ngit log --name-status --oneline [SHA1^..SHA1]File status flags:\nM modified   -   File has been modified\nC copy-edit -    File has been copied and modified\nR rename-edit -  File has been renamed and modified\nA added       -   File has been added\nD deleted -      File has been deleted\nU unmerged -     File has conflicts after a merge   But for seeing the files changed between your branch and its common ancestor with another branch (say origin/master):To supplement @artfulrobot\'s answer, if you want to show changed files between two branches:Be careful on precedence. If you place the newer branch first then it would show files as deleted rather than added.Adding a grep can refine things further:That will then show only files added in myotherbranch.This will show the changes in files:Add below alias to your ~/.bash_profile, then run, source ~/.bash_profile; now anytime you need to see the updated files in the last commit, run, showfiles from your git repository. Use\ngit log --pretty=oneline >C:\\filename.logwhich will log only a oneline (--pretty=oneline) thats the name of the changed file. Also will log all the details to your output file.Also note, if you just want to see the changed files between the last commit and the one before it. This works fine: git show --name-onlyBased on git diff --name-status I wrote the git-diffview git extension that renders a hierarchical tree view of what changed between two paths.
