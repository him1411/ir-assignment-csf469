I am getting this error when I am trying to upload a video in my site.  Can you tell me how to fix this?If you are using IIS for hosting your application, then the default upload file size if 4MB. To increase it, please use this below section in your web.config -For IIS7 and above, you also need to add the lines below:Note: maxAllowedContentLength is measured in bytes while maxRequestLength is measured in kilobytes, which is why the values differ in this config example. (Both are equivalent to 1 GB.)I don\'t think it\'s been mentioned here, but to get this working, I had to supply both of these values in the web.config:In system.webAnd in system.webServerIMPORTANT : Both of these values must match. In this case, my max upload is 1024 megabytes.maxRequestLength has 1048576 KILOBYTES, and maxAllowedContentLength has 1073741824 BYTES.I know it\'s obvious, but it\'s easy to overlook.It may be worth noting that you may want to limit this change to the URL you expect to be used for the upload rather then your entire site.And just in case someone\'s looking for a way to handle this exception and show a meaningful explanation to the user (something like "You\'re uploading a file that is too big"):(ASP.NET 4 or later required)The maximum request size is, by default, 4mb (4096 KB)This is explained here: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;295626The above article also explains how to fix this issue :)There\'s an element in web.config to configure the max size of the uploaded file:It bothered me for days too.\nI modified the Web.config file but it didn\'t work.\nIt turned out that there are two Web.config file in my project,\nand I should modified the one in the ROOT directory, not the others.\nHope this would be helpful.maxRequestLength (length in KB) Here as ex. I took 1024 (1MB)\n   maxAllowedContentLength (length in Bytes) should be same as your maxRequestLength (1048576 bytes = 1MB).If you have a request going to an application in the site, make sure you set maxRequestLength in the root web.config.  The maxRequestLength in the applications\'s web.config appears to be ignored.  If you can\'t update configuration files but control in full the code that handles uploaded files use HttpContext.Current.Request.GetBufferlessInputStream(true). The true value for disableMaxRequestLength parameter tells the framework to ignore  configured request limits.For detailed description visit https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh195568(v=vs.110).aspxI was tripped up by the fact that our web.config file has multiple system.web sections: it worked when I added < httpRuntime maxRequestLength="1048576" /> to the system.web section that at the configuration level.I had to edit the C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\config\\applicationHost.config file and add <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength="1073741824" /> to the end of the... section.As per This Microsoft Support ArticleI can add to config web uncompiled Please check this code demurrer to solve your problem.. copy it, it is a web.config file.\n.
