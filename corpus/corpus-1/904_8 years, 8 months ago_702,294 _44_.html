I really want to know more about the update, export and the values that could be given to hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto\nI need to know when to use the update and when not? And what is the alternative?These are changes that could happen over DB:In each case what is the best solution?From the community documentation:hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto    Automatically validates or exports schema DDL to the database when the SessionFactory is created. With create-drop, the database schema will be dropped when the SessionFactory is closed explicitly.e.g. validate | update | create | create-drop So the list of possible options are,These options seem intended to be developers tools and not to facilitate any production level databases, you may want to have a look at the following question; Hibernate: hbm2ddl.auto=update in production?There\'s also the undocumented value of "none" to disable it entirely.The configuration property is called hibernate.hbm2ddl.autoIn our development environment we set hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create-drop to drop and create a clean database each time we deploy, so that our database is in a known state.In theory, you can set hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update to update your database with changes to your model, but I would not trust that on a production database. An earlier version of the documentation said that this was experimental, at least; I do not know the current status.Therefore, for our production database, do not set hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto - the default is to make no database changes. Instead, we manually create an SQL DDL update script that applies changes from one version to the next.I would use liquibase for updating your db. hibernate\'s schema update feature is really only o.k. for a developer while they are developing new features. In a production situation, the db upgrade needs to be handled more carefully.If you don\'t want to use Strings in your app and are looking for predefined constants have a look at org.hibernate.cfg.AvailableSettings class included in the Hibernate JAR, where you\'ll find a constant for all possible settings. In your case for example:Although it is quite an old post but as i did some research on the topic so thought of sharing it.hibernate.hbm2ddl.autoAs per the documentation it can have four valid values:create  |  update  |  validate  |  create-dropFollowing is the explanation of the behaviour shown by these value:Following are the important points worth noting:In case if i give any value to this property(say abc, instead of above four values discussed above) or it is just left blank. It shows following behaviour:-If schema is not present in the DB:- It creates the schema-If schema is present in the DB:- update the schema.I dedicated a blog post for the most common Hibernate DDL generation strategies:The second approach is much more flexible, especially if you want to mix JPA Entity Model with jOOQ Table Model.Needless to say that this is only an Integration testing concern since for production environment we use Flyway.I Think you should have to concentrate on the this Class Makes Your Configuration Dynamic \nSo it allows you to choose whatever suites you best...Checkout [SchemaExport]hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto automatically validates and exports DDL to the schema when the sessionFactory is created.By default, it does not perform any creation or modification automatically on DB. If the user sets one of the below values then it is doing DDL schema changes automatically.create - doing creating a schemaupdate - updating existing schemavalidate - validate existing schemacreate-drop - create and drop the schema automatically when a session is starts and endsSince 5.0, you can now find those values in a dedicated Enum: org.hibernate.boot.SchemaAutoTooling (enhanced with value NONE since 5.2).Or even better, since 5.1, you can also use the org.hibernate.tool.schema.Action Enum which combines JPA 2 and "legacy" Hibernate DDL actions.But, you cannot yet configure a DataSource programmatically with this. It would be nicer to use this combined with org.hibernate.cfg.AvailableSettings#HBM2DDL_AUTO but the current code expect a String value (excerpt taken from SessionFactoryBuilderImpl):\xe2\x80\xa6 and internal enum values of both org.hibernate.boot.SchemaAutoToolingand org.hibernate.tool.schema.Action aren\'t exposed publicly.Hereunder, a sample programmatic DataSource configuration (used in ones of my Spring Boot applications) which use a gambit thanks to .name().toLowerCase() but it only works with values without dash (not create-drop for instance):validate: validate the schema, do not change happens to the database.\nupdate: update the schema with currently execute query.\ncreate: creates new schema every time, and destroy previous data.\ncreate-drop: drop the schema when the application is stopped or SessionFactory is closed explicitly.In theory, you can set hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update to update your database with changes to your model, but I would not trust that on a production database. An earlier version of the documentation said that this was experimental, at least; I do not know the current status.Therefore, for our production database, do not set hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto - the default is to make no database changes.
