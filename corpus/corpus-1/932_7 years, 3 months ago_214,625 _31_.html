What is the difference between Build Solution, Rebuild Solution, and Clean Solution in Visual Studio?When is the appropriate time to use each one of these?(The links are to the devenv.exe command line switches, but they do the same as the menu items.)Build solution: Compiles code files (DLL and EXE) which are changed.Rebuild: Deletes all compiled files and compiles them again irrespective if the code has changed or not.Clean solution: Deletes all compiled files (DLL and EXE file).You can see this YouTube video (Visual Studio Build vs. Rebuild vs. Clean (C# interview questions with answers)) where I have demonstrated the differences and below are visual representations which will help you to analyze the same in more detail.The difference between Rebuild vs. (Clean + Build), because there seems to be some confusion around this as well:The difference is the way the build and clean sequence happens for every project. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say your solution has two projects, \xe2\x80\x9cproj1\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproj2\xe2\x80\x9d. If you do a rebuild it will take \xe2\x80\x9cproj1\xe2\x80\x9d, clean (delete) the compiled files for \xe2\x80\x9cproj1\xe2\x80\x9d and build it. After that it will take the second project \xe2\x80\x9cproj2\xe2\x80\x9d, clean compiled files for \xe2\x80\x9cproj2\xe2\x80\x9d and compile \xe2\x80\x9cproj2\xe2\x80\x9d.But if you do a \xe2\x80\x9cclean\xe2\x80\x9d and build\xe2\x80\x9d, it will first delete all compiled files for \xe2\x80\x9cproj1\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproj2\xe2\x80\x9d and then it will build \xe2\x80\x9cproj1\xe2\x80\x9d first followed by \xe2\x80\x9cproj2\xe2\x80\x9d.Taken from this link:Build means compile and link only the source files that have changed\n  since the last build, while Rebuild\n  means compile and link all source\n  files regardless of whether they\n  changed or not. Build is the normal\n  thing to do and is faster. Sometimes\n  the versions of project target\n  components can get out of sync and\n  rebuild is necessary to make the build\n  successful. In practice, you never\n  need to Clean.Build Solution - Builds any assemblies which have changed files. If an assembly has no changes, it won\'t be re-built. Also will not delete any intermediate files.Used most commonly.Rebuild Solution - Rebuilds all assemblies regardless of changes but leaves intermediate files.Used when you notice that Visual Studio didn\'t incorporate your changes in the latest assembly. Sometimes Visual Studio does make mistakes.Clean Solution - Delete all intermediate files and rebuild all assemblies regardless of changesUsed when all else fails and you need to clean everything up and start fresh.I just think of Rebuild as performing the Clean first followed by the Build.  Perhaps I am wrong ... comments?Build Solution \xe2\x80\x93 Builds any assemblies which have changed files. If an assembly has no changes, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be re-built. Also will not delete any intermediate files.Rebuild solution will clean and then build the solution from scratch, ignoring anything it\xe2\x80\x99s done beforeClean Solution will delete all compiled files (i.e., EXE\xe2\x80\x99s and DLL\xe2\x80\x99s) from the bin/obj directory.Build solution will build any projects in the solution that have changed. Rebuild builds all projects no matter what, clean solution removes all temporary files ensuring that the next build is complete.Build Solution - Build solution will build your application with building the number of projects which are having any file change. And it does not clear any existing binary files and just replacing updated assemblies in bin or obj folder.Rebuild Solution - Rebuild solution will build your entire application with building all the projects are available in your solution with cleaning them. Before building it clears all the binary files from bin and obj folder.Clean Solution - Clean solution is just clears all the binary files from bin and obj folder.Build solution only builds those projects which have changed in the solution, and does not effect assemblies that have not changed,ReBuild first cleans, all the assemblies from the solution and then builds entire solution regardless of changes done.Clean, simply cleans the solution.
