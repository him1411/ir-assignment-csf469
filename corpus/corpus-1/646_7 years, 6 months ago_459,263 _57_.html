How do I use CSS3 gradients for my background-color and then apply a background-image to apply some sort of light transparent texture?Multiple backgrounds!These 2 lines are the fallback for any browser that doesn\'t do gradients.\n See notes for stacking images only IE < 9 below.The final line sets a background image and gradient for browsers that can handle them.Nearly all current browsers have support for multiple background images and css backgrounds. See http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-gradients for browser support. For a good post on why you don\'t need multiple browser prefixes, see http://codepen.io/thebabydino/full/pjxVWp/Layer StackIt should be noted that the first defined image will be topmost in the stack. In this case, the image is on TOP of the gradient.For more information about background layering see http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#layering.Stacking images ONLY (no gradients in the declaration) For IE < 9IE9 and up can stack images this same way. You could use this to create a gradient image for ie9, though personally, I wouldn\'t. However to be noted when using only images, ie < 9 will ignore the fallback statement and not show any image. This does not happen when a gradient is included. To use a single fallback image in this case I suggest using Paul Irish\'s wonderful Conditional HTML element along with your fallback code:Background position, sizing etc.Other properties that would apply to a single image may also be comma separated. If only 1 value is supplied, that will be applied to all stacked images including the gradient. background-size: 40px; will constrain both the image and the gradient to 40px height and width. However using background-size: 40px, cover; will make the image 40px and the gradient will cover the element. To only apply a setting to one image, set the default for the other: background-position: 50%, 0 0; or for browsers that support it use initial: background-position: 50%, initial;You may also use the background shorthand, however this removes the fallback color and image.The same applies to background-position, background-repeat, etc. If you also want to set background position for your image, than you can use this:or you can also create a LESS mixin (bootstrap style):One thing to realize is that the first defined background image is topmost in the stack. The last defined image will be bottommost. That means, to have a background gradient behind an image, you would need:You could also define background positions and background size for the images.\nI put together a blog post about some interesting things you can do with CSS3 gradientsI had an implementation where I needed to take this technique a step farther, and wanted to outline my work.  The below code does the same thing but uses SASS, Bourbon, and an image sprite.SASS and Bourbon take care of the cross browser code, and now all I have to declare is the sprite position per button.  It is easy to extend this principal for the buttons active and hover states.you could simply type :my solution:I always use the following code to make it work. There are some notes:This technique is just the same as we have multiple background images as describe hereI made an example with enjoycsshttp://enjoycss.com/5q#backgroundin enjoycss editor you can conbine any number of backgrounds,\nlinear, repeating-linear, radial, repeating-radial,images,colorsyou adjust your backgrounds with GUI and it automaticaly generates the codecode is here http://enjoycss.com/5q/code/0/background#backgroundI was trying to do the same thing. While background-color and background-image exist on separate layers within an object -- meaning they can co-exist -- CSS gradients seem to co-opt the background-image layer. From what I can tell, border-image seems to have wider support than multiple backgrounds, so maybe that\'s an alternative approach. http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/css3-border-imagesUPDATE: A bit more research. Seems Petra Gregorova has something working here --> http://petragregorova.com/demos/css-gradient-and-bg-image-final.htmlHere is a MIXIN that I created to handle everything that people might like to use:This can be used like so:Hope you guys find this helpful.credit to @Gidgidonihah for finding the initial solution.If you have strange errors with downloading background images use W3C Link checker: https://validator.w3.org/checklinkHere are modern mixins that I use (credits: PSA: don\'t use gradient generators):As a sure method way, you can just make a background image that is say 500x5 pixels, in your css use:Where xxxxxx corresponds with the color that matches the final gradient color.You could also fix this to the bottom of the screen and have it match the initial gradient color.If you have to get gradients and background images working together in IE 9 (HTML 5 & HTML 4.01 Strict), add the following attribute declaration to your css class and it should do the trick:Notice that you use the filter attribute and that there are two instances of progid:[val] separated by a comma before you close the attribute value with a semicolon. Here\'s the fiddle. Also notice that when you look at the fiddle the gradient extends beyond the rounded corners. I don\'t have a fix for that other not using rounded corners. Also note that when using a relative path in the src [IMAGE_URL] attribute, the path is relative to the document page and not the css file (See source).This article (http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/28/css3-solutions-for-internet-explorer/) is what lead me to this solution. It\'s pretty helpful for IE-specific CSS3.I wanted to make span button with background image, background gradient combination. http://enjoycss.com/ helped to do my work task. Only I have to remove some auto generated additional CSS. But it\'s really nice site build your scratch work.I resolve the problem in that way. I define Gradient in HTML and background image in the BodyFor my responsive design, my drop-box down-arrow on the right side of the box (vertical accordion), accepted percentage as position. Initially the down-arrow was "position: absolute; right: 13px;". With the 97% positioning it worked like charm as follows:\nP.S.  Sorry, don\'t know how to handle the filters.
