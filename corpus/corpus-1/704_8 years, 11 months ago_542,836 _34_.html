How do I make vi-Vim never use tabs (converting spaces to tabs, bad!), makes the tab key == 4 spaces, and automatically indent code after curly brace blocks like Emacs does?Also, how do I save these settings so I never have to input them again?I\'ve seen other questions related to this, but it always seems to be a little off from what I want.As has been pointed out in a couple of answers below, the preferred method now is NOT to use smartindent, but instead use the following (in your .vimrc):\nIn your .vimrc: file:The help files take a bit of time to get used to, but the more you read, the better Vim gets:Even better, you can embed these settings in your source for portability:To see your current settings:As graywh points out in the comments, smartindent has been replaced by cindent which "Works more cleverly", although still mainly for languages with C-like syntax:Related, if you open a file that uses both tabs and spaces, assuming you\'ve gotYou can replace all the tabs with spaces in the entire file withThe best way to get filetype-specific indentation is to use filetype plugin indent on in your vimrc.  Then you can specify things like set sw=4 sts=4 et in .vim/ftplugin/c.vim, for example, without having to make those global for all files being edited and other non-C type syntaxes will get indented correctly, too (even lisps).To have 4-space tabs in most files, real 8-wide tab char in Makefiles, and automatic indenting in various files including C/C++, put this in your ~/.vimrc file:The recommended way is to use filetype based indentation and only use smartindent and cindent if that doesn\'t suffice.Add the following to your .vimrcHope it helps as being a different answer.On many Linux systems, like Ubuntu, the .vimrc file doesn\'t exist by default, so it is recommended that you create it first.Don\'t use the .viminfo file that exist in the home directory. It is used for a different purpose.Step 1: Go to your home directorycd ~Step 2: Create the filevim .vimrcStep 3: Add the configuration stated aboveStep 3: Save file, by pressing Shift + ZZ.From the VIM wiki:edit your ~/.vimrcadd following lines :The auto-indent is based on the current syntax mode. I know that if you are editing Foo.java, then entering a { and hitting Enter indents the following line.As for tabs, there are two settings. Within Vim, type a colon and then "set tabstop=4" which will set the tabs to display as four spaces. Hit colon again and type "set expandtab" which will insert spaces for tabs. You can put these settings in a .vimrc (or _vimrc on Windows) in your home directory, so you only have to type them once.@netjeff had the best answer IMHO.It is dynamic and accomplishes the same thing in one line.Somewhat of an outside the box answer, but I use a fully programmable keyboard and have a 4 space macro set to fn+tab.
