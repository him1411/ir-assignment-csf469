How can I list all files of a directory in Python and add them to a list?os.listdir() will get you everything that\'s in a directory - files and directories.If you want just files, you could either filter this down using os.path:or you could use os.walk() which will yield two lists for each directory it visits - splitting into files and dirs for you. If you only want the top directory you can just break the first time it yieldsAnd lastly, as that example shows, adding one list to another you can either use .extend() or Personally, I prefer .extend()I prefer using the glob module, as it does pattern matching and expansion.Will return a list with the queried files:will return a list of all files and directories in "somedirectory".A one-line solution to get only list of files (no subdirectories):or absolute pathnames:\nupdated: 20/09/2017outputThere are only files here[\'a simple game.py\', \'data.txt\', \'decorator.py\', \'deep_reverse_list.py\', \'deep_reverse_list2.py\', \'hangman.py\', \'import pygame.py\', \'list_click_display.py\', \'os_path.py\']If you want to use list comprehensionTo include all the files in the subdirectory (in this example there are 11 files in the first directory and 3 in a subdirectory) I will use os.walk() that works sell in python 3.5 and newer versions:output[\'append_to_list.py\', \'data.txt\', \'data1.txt\', \'data2.txt\', \'data_180617\', \'os_walk.py\', \'READ2.py\', \'read_data.py\', \'somma_defaltdic.py\', \'substitute_words.py\', \'sum_data.py\', \'data.txt\', \'data1.txt\', \'data_180617\']you can also do something like this to get only filesWhen you use next(os.walk(\',\')), you have the same results of os.listdir(), but you have the root as the first item of the list, all the folders in the second item and all the files in the third, while in os.listdir() you have folders and files in the same list. In both case (next(os.walk(\'.\')) and os.listdir()) you just look in the current directory, leaving the subdirectory alone (you must use os.walk(\'-\') for that, as we showed before).Another example with scandir (a little variation from docs.python.org)\n  This one is more efficient than os.listdir. In this case, it shows the files only in the current directory where the script is executed.Use getcwd() to get the current work directory in python 2 (or (\'.\'))To go up in the directory tree, you got to code like this:list of files with absolute pathIt\'s the same as in Python 3 (except the print)5.1 - python 2 - os.walk(\'.\')Let\'s make an example for python 2.7 with walk (same as python 3).outputThis means that starting from the folder named "tool", there are 829\n  files in that dir and in the subdirs.Getting Full File Paths From a Directory and All Its Subdirectoriesprint full_file_paths which will print the list:If you\'d like, you can open and read the contents, or focus only on files with the extension ".dat" like in the code below:/Users/johnny/Desktop/TEST/SUBFOLDER/file3.datSince version 3.4 there are builtin iterators for this which are a lot more efficient than os.listdir():pathlib: New in version 3.4.According to PEP 428, the aim of the pathlib library is to provide a simple hierarchy of classes to handle filesystem paths and the common operations users do over them. os.scandir(): New in version 3.5.Note that os.walk() use os.scandir() instead of os.listdir() from version 3.5 and it\'s speed got increased by 2-20 times according to PEP 471.Let me also recommend reading ShadowRanger\'s comment below.I really liked adamk\'s answer, suggesting that you use glob(), from the module of the same name. This allows you to have pattern matching with *s.But as other people pointed out in the comments, glob() can get tripped up over inconsistent slash directions. To help with that, I suggest you use the join() and expanduser() functions in the os.path module, and perhaps the getcwd() function in the os module, as well.As examples:The above is terrible - the path has been hardcoded and will only ever work on Windows between the drive name and the \\s being hardcoded into the path.The above works better, but it relies on the folder name Users which is often found on Windows and not so often found on other OSs. It also relies on the user having a specific name, admin.This works perfectly across all platforms.Another great example that works perfectly across platforms and does something a bit different:Hope these examples help you see the power of a few of the functions you can find in the standard Python library modules.You should use os module for listing directory content.os.listdir(".") returns all the contents of the directory. We iterate over the result and append to the list.os.listdir returns a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by path. If you are looking for a Python implementation of find, this is a recipe I use rather frequently:So I made a PyPI package out of it and there is also a GitHub repository. I hope that someone finds it potentially useful for this code.Returning a list of absolute filepaths, does not recurse into subdirectoriesPython 3.5 introduced new, faster method for walking through the directory - os.scandir().Example:List all files in a directory:Here, you get list of all files in a directory.Using generatorsIf you care about performance, try scandir, for Python 2.x, you may need to install it manually. Examples:This save a lot of time when you need to scan a huge directory, you do not need to buffer a huge list, just fetch one by one. And also you can do it recursively:Use this function if you want to different file type or get full directory.By using os library.Here is a simple example:Note: Change . to your path value or variable.Here is the example returning list of files with absolute paths:Documentation: os and os.path for Python 2, os and os.path for Python 3.This will list even the hidden stuff.
