We\'re using git submodules to manage a couple of large projects that have dependencies on many other libraries we\'ve developed. Each library is a separate repo brought into the dependant project as a submodule. During development, we often want to just go grab the latest version of every dependant submodule.Does git have a built in command to do this?  If not, how about a Windows batch file or similar that can do it?For git 1.8.2 or above the option --remote was added to support updating to latest tips of remote branches:This has the added benefit of respecting any "non default" branches specified in the .gitmodules or .git/config files (if you happen to have any, default is origin/master, in which case some of the other answers here would work as well).For git 1.7.3 or above you can use (but the below gotchas around what update does still apply):or:if you want to pull your submodules to latest commits intead of what the repo points to.Note: If that\'s the first time you checkout a repo you need to use --init first:For older, git 1.6.1 or above you can use something similar to (modified to suit):See git-submodule(1) for detailsIf you need to pull stuff for submodules into your submodule repositories  usea feature git first learned in 1.7.3.But this will not checkout proper commits(the ones your master repository points to) in submodulesTo checkout proper commits in your submodules you should update them after pulling usingNote: This is from 2009 and may have been good then but there are better options now.We use this.  It\'s called git-pup:Just put it in a suitable bin directory (/usr/local/bin).  If on Windows, you may need to modify the syntax to get it to work :)Update:In response to the comment by the original author about pulling in all of the HEADs of all of the submodules -- that is a good question.I am pretty sure that git does not have a command for this internally.  In order to do so, you would need to identify what HEAD really is for a submodule.  That could be as simple as saying master is the most up to date branch, etc...Following this, create a simple script that does the following:I\'d like to mention that this style is not really what git submodules were designed for.  Typically, you want to say "LibraryX" is at version "2.32" and will stay that way until I tell it to "upgrade".That is, in a sense, what you are doing with the described script, but just more automatically.  Care is required!Update 2:If you are on a windows platform, you may want to look at using Python to implement the script as it is very capable in these areas.  If you are on unix/linux, then I suggest just a bash script.Need any clarifications?  Just post a comment.from within the git repo directory, works best for me.This will pull all latest including submodules.Henrik is on the right track.  The \'foreach\' command can execute any arbitrary shell script.  Two options to pull the very latest might be,and,That will iterate through all initialized submodules and run the given commands.The following worked for me on Windows.Edit:In the comments was pointed out (by philfreo ) that the latest version is required. If there is any nested submodules that need to be in their latest version :-----Outdated comment below-----Isn\'t this the official way to do it ?I use it every time. No problems so far.Edit:I just found that you can use:Which will also recursively pull all of the submodules, i.e. dependancies.As it may happens that the default branch of your submodules is not master, this is how I automate the full Git submodules upgrades:Clone and Init SubmoduleDuring development just pull and update submodulenote: last two commands have same behaviourI don\'t know since which version of git this is working, but that\'s what you\'re searching for:I use it with git pull to update the root repository, too:Look at http://lists.zerezo.com/git/msg674976.html which introduces a --track parameterGit for windows 2.6.3:git submodule update --rebase --remoteI did this by adapting gahooa\'s answer above:Integrate it with a git [alias] ... If your parent project has something like this in .gitmodules:Add something like this inside your .gitconfigThen to update your submodules, run:I have an example of it in my environment setup repo.Remark: not too easy way, but workable and it has its own unique pros.If one want to clone only HEAD revision of a repository and only HEADs of all the its submodules (i.e. to checkout "trunk"), then one can use following Lua script. Sometimes simple command git submodule update --init --recursive --remote --no-fetch --depth=1 can result in an unrecoverable git error. In this case one need to clean up subdirectory of .git/modules directory and clone submodule manually using git clone --separate-git-dir command. The only complexity is to find out URL, path of .git directory of submodule and path of submodule in superproject tree.Remark: the script is only tested against https://github.com/boostorg/boost.git repository. Its peculiarities: all the submodules hosted on the same host and .gitmodules contains only relative URLs.Here is the command-line to pull from all of your git repositories whether they\'re or not submodules:If you running it in your top git repository, you can replace "$ROOT" into ..I think you\'ll have to write a script to do this. To be honest, I might install python to do it so that you can use os.walk to cd to each directory and issue the appropriate commands. Using python or some other scripting language, other than batch, would allow you to easily add/remove subprojects with out having to modify the script.
