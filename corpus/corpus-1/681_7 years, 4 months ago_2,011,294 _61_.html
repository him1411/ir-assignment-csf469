What\'s the simplest way to create and write to a (text) file in Java?Creating a text file (note that this will overwrite the file if it already exists):Creating a binary file (will also overwrite the file):Java 7+ users can use the Files class to write to files:Creating a text file:Creating a binary file:In Java 7 and up:There are useful utilities for that though:Note also that you can use a FileWriter, but it uses the default encoding, which is often a bad idea - it\'s best to specify the encoding explicitly.Below is the original, prior-to-java-7 answerSee also: Reading, Writing, and Creating Files (includes NIO2).If you already have the content you want to write to the file (and not generated on the fly), the java.nio.file.Files addition in Java 7 as part of native I/O provides the simplest and most efficient way to achieve your goals.Basically creating and writing to a file is one line only, moreover one simple method call!The following example creates and writes to 6 different files to showcase how it can be used:Here\'s a little example program to create or overwrite a file. It\'s the long version so it can be understood more easily.Use:Using try() will close stream automatically. This version is short, fast (buffered) and enables choosing encoding.  This feature was introduced in Java 7.  A very simple way to create and write to a file in Java:Reference: File create Example in javaHere we are entering a string into a text file:We can easily create a new file and add content into it.If you wish to have a relatively pain-free experience you can also have a look at the Apache Commons IO package, more specifically the FileUtils class.Never forget to check third-party libraries. Joda-Time for date manipulation, Apache Commons Lang StringUtils for common string operations and such can make your code more readable. Java is a great language, but the standard library is sometimes a bit low-level. Powerful, but low-level nonetheless.Since the author did not specify whether they require a solution for Java versions that have been EoL\'d (by both Sun and IBM, and these are technically the most widespread JVMs), and due to the fact that most people seem to have answered the author\'s question before it was specified that it is a text (non-binary) file, I have decided to provide my answer.First of all, Java 6 has generally reached end of life, and since the author did not specify he needs legacy compatibility, I guess it automatically means J7 or above (J7 is not yet EoL\'d by IBM). So, we can look right at the file I/O tutorial: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/legacy.htmlPrior to the Java SE 7 release, the java.io.File class was the\n  mechanism used for file I/O, but it had several drawbacks.Oh well, that rules out java.io.File. If a file cannot be written/appended, you may not be able to even know why.We can continue looking at the tutorial: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/file.html#commonIf you have all lines you will write (append) to the text file in advance, the recommended approach is\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#write-java.nio.file.Path-java.lang.Iterable-java.nio.charset.Charset-java.nio.file.OpenOption...-Here\'s an example (simplified):Another example (append):If you want to write file content as you go:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#newBufferedWriter-java.nio.file.Path-java.nio.charset.Charset-java.nio.file.OpenOption...-Simplified example (J8 or up):Another example (append):These methods require minimal effort on the author\'s part and should be preferred to all others when writing to [text] files.Use:I think this is the shortest way:If you for some reason want to separate the act of creating and writing, the Java equivalent of touch iscreateNewFile() does an existence check and file create atomically.  This can be useful if you want to ensure you were the creator of the file before writing to it, for example.To create file without overwriting existing file:The simplest way I can find:It will probably only work for 1.7+.One line only !\npath and line are Strings If we are using Java 7 and above and also know the content to be added (appended) to the file we can make use of newBufferedWriter method in NIO package.There are few points to note:Though OP has not asked but just in case we want to search for lines having some specific keyword e.g. confidential we can make use of stream APIs in Java:File reading and writing using input and outputstream:Just include this package:And then you can use this code to write the file:There are some simple ways, like:It\'s worth a try for Java 7+:It looks promising...Using Google\'s Guava library, we can create and write to a file very \neasily.The example creates a new fruits.txt file in the project root directory.You can even create a temporary file using a system property, which will be independent of which OS you are using.For multiple files you can use:It\'s working great.Reading collection with customers and saving to file, with JFilechooser.Creating a sample file:
