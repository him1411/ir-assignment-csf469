I know we can set the following values to the android:gravity and  android:layout_gravity properties:But I am confused regarding both of these.What is the difference between the usage of android:gravity and android:layout_gravity?Their names should help you:And an example is here.android:layout_gravity is the Outside gravity of the View. That means, to specify the direction in which the View should touch it\'s parent\'s border.android:gravity is the Inside gravity of that View. This means, in which direction it\'s contents should align.HTML/CSS Equivalents:android:layout_gravity = float in CSSandroid:gravity = text-align in CSSEasy trick to remember: Take "layout-gravity" as "Lay-outside-gravity"Inside - OutsideSometimes it helps to see a picture, too. The green and blue are TextViews and the other two background colors are LinearLayouts.So remember, layout_gravity arranges a view in its layout. Gravity arranges the content inside the view. Here is the xml for the above image for your reference:Short Answer: use android:gravity or setGravity() to control gravity of all child views of a container; use android:layout_gravity or setLayoutParams() to control gravity of an individual view in a container.Long story: to control gravity in a linear layout container such as LinearLayout or RadioGroup, there are two approaches:1) To control the gravity of ALL child views of a LinearLayout container (as you did in your book), use android:gravity (not android:layout_gravity) in layout XML file or setGravity() method in code.2) To control the gravity of a child view in its container, use android:layout_gravity XML attribute. In code, one needs to get the LinearLayout.LayoutParams of the view and set its gravity. Here is a code example that set a button to bottom in a horizontally oriented container:For horizontal LinearLayout container, the horizontal gravity of its child view is left-aligned one after another and cannot be changed. Setting android:layout_gravity to center_horizontal has no effect.  The default vertical gravity is center (or center_vertical) and can be changed to top or bottom. Actually the default layout_gravity value is -1 but Android put it center vertically. To change the horizontal positions of child views in a horizontal linear container, one can use layout_weight, margin and padding of the child view. Similarly, for vertical View Group container, the vertical gravity of its child view is top-aligned one below another and cannot be changed. The default horizontal gravity is center (or center_horizontal) and can be changed to left or right.Actually, a child view such as a button also has android:gravity XML attribute and the setGravity() method to control its child views -- the text in it. The Button.setGravity(int) is linked to this developer.android.com entry.From what I can gather layout_gravity is the gravity of that view inside its parent, and gravity is the gravity of the children inside that view.I think this is right but the best way to find out is to play around.Look at the image to be clear about gravityThough the question is already answered I have some samples demonstrating the use of gravity, layout_gravity, and layout_weight. You can find the examples at http://juanpickselov.com/LayoutExamples.zip I created the files in Eclipse, removed the .svn subfolders and have included styles, strings, colors, etc. The layout files are the main point of the demos. Since I\'m a Java and Android development Newbie, one may find the Java inefficient. The files can be copied into an Eclipse Project or I\'ve also used them in Netbeans with the Android development plugin available for that IDE.If a we want to set the gravity of content inside a view then we will use "android:gravity", and if we want to set the gravity of this view (as a whole) within its parent view then we will use "android:layout_gravity". Just thought I\'d add my own explanation here - coming from a background on iOS, this is how I\'ve internalized the two in iOS terms: "Layout Gravity" affects your position in the superview. "Gravity" affects the position of your subviews within you. Said another way, Layout Gravity positions you yourself while gravity positions your children.Something I saw on Sandip\'s blog that I almost missed, fixed my problem. He said layout_gravity DOES NOT WORK WITH LinearLayout. If you\'re using a LinearLayout and the gravity settings are driving you nuts (like me), then switch to something else. I actually switched to a RelativeLayout then used layout_alignParentLeft and layout_alignParentRight on the 2 contained TextViews to get them on one line to go far left and far right.There is many difference in the gravity and layout-gravity. I am going to explain my experience about these 2 concepts(All information i got due to my observation and some websites).Use Of Gravity and Layout-gravity in FrameLayout .....Note:- Gravity is used inside the View Content as some User have answer and it is same for all ViewGroup Layout. Layout-gravity is used with the parent View as some User have answer.Gravity and Layout-gravity is work more useful with the FrameLayout childs . We can\'t use Gravity and Layout-gravity in FrameLayout\'s Tag ....We can set Child View any where in the FrameLayout using layout-gravity .We can use every single value of gravity inside the FrameLayout (eg:- center_vertical, center_horizontal, center,top, etc), but it is not possible with other ViewGroup Layouts . FrameLayout fully working on Layout-gravity.  Example:- If you work on FrameLayout then you don\'t need to change whole Layout for adding new View. You just add View as last in the FrameLayout and give him Layout-gravity with value.(This is adavantages of layout-gravity with FrameLayout).have look on example ...... Output:-Use Of Gravity and Layout-gravity in LinearLayout .....Gravity working same as above but here differnce is that we can use Gravity inside the LinearLayout View and RelativeLayout View which is not possible in FrameLayout View.LinearLayout with orientation vertical ....Note:- Here we can set only 3 values of layout_gravity that is (left | right | center (also called center_horizontal)).have look on example :- Output:-LinearLayout with orientation horizontal ....Note:- Here we can set also 3 values of layout_gravity that is (top | bottom | center (also called center_vertical)).have look on example :-output:- Note:- We can\'t use layout_gravity in the RelativeLayout Views but we can use gravity to set RelativeLayout childs to same position....android:gravity is used to specify how to place the content of the object within the object itself. In another word, android:gravity is used to specify the gravity of the content of the view.android:layout_gravity is an attribution the child can supply to its parent, to specify the gravity the view within its parents.For more details you can visit http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/LinearLayout.LayoutParams.htmlThe basic difference between the two is that-android:gravity is used for child elements of the view.android:layout_gravity is used for this element with respect to parent view.An easy trick to remember this is gravity applies to us inside earth. So, android:gravity is for inside the view.Rememeber the out in layout_gravity which would help you to remember that android:layout_gravity would refer to outside the viewGravity is used to set text alignment in views but layout_gravity is use to set views it self. Lets take an example if you want to align text written in editText then use gravity and you want align this editText or any button or any view then use layout_gravity, So its very simple.is used to adjust for content of the view relative to its specify position (allocated area). android:gravity="left"  would not do anything if layout_width is equal to the "wrap_content"is used for view itself relative to the parent or layout file.gravity: is used for simple views like textview, edittext etc.layout_gravity: is used for parent views like linear layout to make view in center of its parents. android:gravity -> Sets the gravity of the content of the View its used on.android:layout_gravity -> Sets the gravity of it\'s Parent\'s view or Layout
