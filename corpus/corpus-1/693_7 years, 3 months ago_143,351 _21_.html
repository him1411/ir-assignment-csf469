Will null instanceof SomeClass return false or throw a NullPointerException?No, a null check is not needed before using instanceof. The expression x instanceof SomeClass is false if x is null.From the Java Language Specification, at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.20.2"At run time, the result of the\n  instanceof operator is true  if the\n  value of the RelationalExpression is\n  not null and the reference could be\n  cast (\xc2\xa715.16)  to the ReferenceType\n  without raising a ClassCastException.\n  Otherwise the result is false."So if the operand is null, the result is false.Using a null reference as first operand with instanceof, returns false.(It takes 1 minute to try it)Very good question indeed. I just tried for myself.PrintsJLS / 15.20.2. Type Comparison Operator instanceofAt run time, the result of the instanceof operator is true if the value of the RelationalExpression is not null and the reference could be cast to the ReferenceType without raising a ClassCastException. Otherwise the result is false.API / Class#isInstance(Object)If this Class object represents an interface, this method returns true if the class or any superclass of the specified Object argument implements this interface; it returns false otherwise. If this Class object represents a primitive type, this method returns false.No, it\'s not. instanceof would return false if its first operand is null.Java literal null is not an instance of any class. Therefore it can not be an instanceof any class. instanceof will return either false or true therefore the <referenceVariable> instanceof <SomeClass> returns false when referenceVariable value is null.The instanceof operator does not need explicit null checks, as it does not throw a NullPointerException if the operand is null.At run time, the result of the instanceof operator is true if the value of the relational expression is not null and the reference could be cast to the reference type without raising a class cast exception.If the operand is null, the instanceof operator returns false and hence, explicit null checks are not required.Consider the below example,The correct usage of instanceof is as shown below,
