How can I remove those annoying Mac OS X .DS_Store files from a Git repository?Remove existing files from the repository:Add the lineto the file .gitignore, which can be found at the top level of your repository (or created if it isn\'t there already).  ThenCombining benzado and webmat\'s answers, updating with git rm, not failing on files found that aren\'t in repo, and making it paste-able generically for any user:The best solution to tackle this issue is to Globally ignore these files from all the git repos on your system. This can be done by creating a global gitignore file like:Adding Rules for ignoring files like:Now, add this file to your global git config:Edit:Removed Icons as they might need to be committed as application assets.In some situations you may also want to ignore some files globally. For me, .DS_Store is one of them. Here\'s how:(Or any file of your choice)Then edit the file just like a repo\'s .gitignore. Note that I think you have to use an absolute path.I had to change git-rm to git rm in the above to get it to work:delete them using git-rm, and then add .DS_Store to .gitignore to stop them getting added again. You can also use blueharvest to stop them getting created all togetherIf you are unable to remove the files because they have changes staged use:  Open terminal and type "cd < ProjectPath >"Remove existing files:\nfind . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatchnano .gitignoreAdd this .DS_Storetype "ctrl + x"Type "y"Enter to save filegit add .gitignoregit commit -m \'.DS_Store removed.\'I found that the following line from snipplr does best on wiping all .DS_Store, including one that has local modifications.--cached option, keeps your local .DS_Store since it gonna be reproduced anyway.And just like mentioned all above, add .DS_Store to .gitignore file on the root of your project. Then it will be no longer in your sight (of repos).The following worked best for me.  Handled unmatched files, and files with local modifications.  For reference, this was on a Mac 10.7 system running git 1.7.4.4.Find and remove:I also globally ignore .DS_Store across all repositories by setting a global core.excludesfile.First, create the file (if one doesn\'t already exist):Then add the following line and save:Now configure git to respect the file globally:Use this command to remove the existing files:Then add .DS_Store to .gitignoreThis will work:There are a few solutions to resolve this problem. \nTo avoid creating .DS_Store files, do not to use the OS X Finder to view folders. An alternative way to view folders is to use UNIX command line.\nTo remove the .DS_Store files a third-party product called DS_Store Terminator can be used.\nTo delete the .DS_Store files from the entire system a UNIX shell command can be used.\nLaunch Terminal from Applications:Utilities\nAt the UNIX shell prompt enter the following UNIX command:\nsudo find / -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \\;\nWhen prompted for a password enter the Mac OS X Administrator password.This command is to find and remove all occurrences of .DS_Store starting from the root (/) of the file system through the entire machine.\nTo configure this command to run as a scheduled task follow the steps below:\nLaunch Terminal from Applications:Utilities\nAt the UNIX shell prompt enter the following UNIX command:sudo crontab -e\nWhen prompted for a password enter the Mac OS X Administrator password.\nOnce in the vi editor press the letter I on your keyboard once and enter the following:15 1 * * * root find / -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \\;This is called crontab entry, which has the following format:Minute Hour DayOfMonth Month DayOfWeek User Command.The crontab entry means that the command will be executed by the system automatically at 1:15 AM everyday by the account called root.The command starts from find all the way to . If the system is not running this command will not get executed.To save the entry press the Esc key once, then simultaneously press Shift + z+ z.Note: Information in Step 4 is for the vi editor only.For some reason none of above worked on my mac.My solution is from terminal run ThenWhen initializing your repository, skip the git command that containsand it shouldn\'t be an issue.This worked for me, combo of two answers from above:add this to your file .gitignoresave this and make commit and now you ignore this for all your commits
