If I inherit from a base class and want to pass something from the constructor of the inherited class to the constructor of the base class, how do I do that?For example,If I inherit from the Exception class I want to do something like this:Basically what I want is to be able to pass the string message to the base Exception class.Modify your constructor to the following so that it calls the base class constructor properly:Note that a constructor is not something that you can call anytime within a method. That\'s the reason you\'re getting errors in your call in the constructor body.Note that you can use static methods within the call to the base constructor.If you need to call the base constructor but not right away because your new (derived) class needs to do some data manipulation, the best solution is to resort to factory method. What you need to do is to mark private your derived constructor, then make a static method in your class that will do all the necessary stuff and later call the constructor and return the object.You can pass inner exception to one of the constructors.It is true use the base (something) to call the base class constructor, but in case of overloading use the this keywordFrom Framework Design Guidelines and FxCop rules.:1. Custom Exception should have a name that ends with Exception2. Exception should be public3. CA1032: Exception should implements standard constructors.A serialization constructor protected if the type is not sealed and private if the type is sealed. \nBased on MSDN:orYou can also do a conditional check and pass in properties in the constructor, which allows some flexibility.orAs per some of the other answers listed here, you can pass parameters into the base class constructor.  It is advised to call your base class constructor at the beginning of the constructor for your inherited class.I note that in your example you never made use of the extraInfo parameter, so I assumed you might want to concatenate the extraInfo string parameter to the Message property of your exception (it seems that this is being ignored in the accepted answer and the code in your question).This is simply achieved by invoking the base class constructor, and then updating the Message property with the extra info.Alternatively, as the Message property is inherited from the base class, you don\'t even have to call the base class constructor explicitly.  You can just update the Message property directly from the constructor of your inherited class, like this:
