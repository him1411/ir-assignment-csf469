Say I create an object as follows:What is the best way to remove the property regex to end up with new myObject as follows?Like this:For anyone interested in reading more about it, Stack Overflow user kangax has written an incredibly in-depth blog post about the delete statement on their blog, Understanding delete. It is highly recommended.Look at the benchmark.Delete is the only true way to remove object\'s properties without any leftovers, but it works ~ 100 times slower, \ncompared to its "alternative", setting object[key] = undefined.This alternative is not the correct answer to this question! But, if you use it with care, you can dramatically speed up some algorithms. If you are using delete in loops and you have problems with performance, read the verbose explanation.An object may be seen as a set of key-value pairs. What I call a \'value\' is a primitive or a reference to other object, connected to that \'key\'. Use delete, when you are passing the result object to the code on which you don\'t have control (or when you are not sure about your team or yourself).It deletes the key from the hashmap.Use setting to undefined, when you care about performance. It can give a serious boost to your code. The key remains on its place in the hashmap, only the value is replaced with undefined. Understand, that for..in loop will still iterate over that key.Using this method, not all ways of determining property existence will work as expected. However, this code:object.field === undefinedwill behave equivalently for both methods.To summarize, differences are all about ways of determining the property existence, and about for..in loop.This works in Firefox and Internet Explorer, and I think it works in all others.As others have said, you can use delete. But JavaScript is an OOP Language, so everything is an object. Thus, I feel it necessary to point out a particular caveat.In arrays, unlike plain old objects, using delete leaves behind garbage in the form of null, creating a "hole" in the array.As you can see, delete doesn\'t always work as one might expect. The value is overwritten, but the memory is not reallocated.Ignoring the dangers and problems inherent in null, and the space wasted, this can be problematic if the array needs to be precise.For example, say you are creating a webapp that uses JSON-serialization to store an array used for \'tabs\' in a string (in this case, localStorage). Let\'s also say that the code uses the numerical indices of the array\'s members to "title" them when drawing to the screen. Why are you doing this rather than just storing the "title" as well? Because... reasons.Okay, let\'s just say that you\'re trying to save memory at the request of this one user who runs a PDP-11 minicomputer from the 1960\'s running UNIX, and wrote his own Elinks-based, JavaScript-compliant, line-printer-friendly browser because X11 is out of the question.Increasingly stupid edge-case scenario aside, using delete on said array will result in null polluting the array, and probably causing bugs in the app later on. And if you check for null, it would straight up skip the numbers resulting in the tabs being rendered like [1] [2] [4] [5] .... Yeah, that\'s definitely not what you wanted.Now, you could keep a second iterator, like j, to increment only when valid values are read from the array. But that wouldn\'t exactly solve the null issue, and you still have to please that troll PDP-11 user. Alas, his computer just doesn\'t have enough memory to hold that last integer (don\'t ask how he manages to handle a variable-width array...).So, he sends you an email in anger:About now, you\'re at your wit\'s end. This guy has been complaining non-stop about your app, and you want to tell him to shut up and go get a better computer.Luckily, arrays do have a specialized method for deleting indices and reallocating memory: Array.prototype.splice(). You could write something like this:And just like that, you\'ve pleased Mr. PDP-11. Hooray! (I\'d still tell him off, though...)Another alternative is to use the Underscore.js library. Note that _.pick() and _.omit() both return a copy of the object and don\'t directly modify the original object. Assigning the result to the original object should do the trick (not shown).Reference: link _.pick(object, *keys)Return a copy of the object, filtered to only have values for the \nwhitelisted keys (or array of valid keys).Reference: link _.omit(object, *keys)Return a copy of the object, filtered to omit the \nblacklisted keys (or array of keys).For arrays, _.filter() and _.reject() can be used in a similar manner. Old question, modern answer. Using object destructuring, an ECMAScript 6 feature, it\'s as simple as:Or with the questions sample:You can see it in action in the Babel try-out editor.Edit:To reassign to the same variable, use a let:The term you have used in your question title Remove a property from a JavaScript object, can be interpreted in some different ways. The one is to remove it for whole the memory and the list of object keys or the other is just to remove it from your object. As it has been mentioned in some other answers, the delete keyword is the main part. Let\'s say you have your object like:If you do:the result would be:You can delete that specific key from your object keys like:Then your objects key using Object.keys(myJSONObject) would be:But the point is if you care about memory and you want to whole the object gets removed from the memory, it is recommended to set it to null before you delete the key:The other important point here is to be careful about your other references to the same object. For instance, if you create a variable like:Or add it as a new pointer to another object like:Then even if you remove it from your object myJSONObject, that specific object won\'t get deleted from the memory, since the regex variable and myOtherObject["regex"] still have their values. Then how could we remove the object from the memory for sure?The answer would be to delete all the references you have in your code, pointed to that very object and also not use var statements to create new references to that object. This last point regarding var statements, is one of the most crucial issues that we are usually faced with, because using var statements would prevent the created object from getting removed.Which means in this case you won\'t be able to remove that object because you have created the regex variable via a var statement, and if you do:The result would be false, which means that your delete statement haven\'t been executed as you expected. But if you had not created that variable before, and you only had myOtherObject["regex"] as your last existing reference, you could have done this just by removing it like:In other words, a JavaScript object gets killed as soon as there is no reference left in your code pointed to that object.Update:\nThanks to @AgentME:Setting a property to null before deleting it doesn\'t accomplish\n  anything (unless the object has been sealed by Object.seal and the\n  delete fails. That\'s not usually the case unless you specifically\n  try).To get more info on Object.seal: Object.seal()Suppose you have an object that looks like this:If you want to use the entire staff array, the proper way to do this, would be to do this:Alternatively, you could also do this:Similarly, removing the entire students array would be done by calling delete Hogwarts.students; or delete Hogwarts[\'students\'];.Now, if you want to remove a single staff member or student, the procedure is a bit different, because both properties are arrays themselves.If you know the index of your staff member, you could simply do this:If you do not know the index, you\'ll also have to do an index search:While you technically can use delete for an array, using it would result in getting incorrect results when calling for example Hogwarts.staff.length later on. In other words, delete would remove the element, but it wouldn\'t update the value of length property. Using delete would also mess up your indexing.So, when deleting values from an object, always first consider whether you\'re dealing with object properties or whether you\'re dealing with array values, and choose the appropriate strategy based on that.If you want to experiment with this, you can use this Fiddle as a starting point.The delete operator is the best way to do so.A live example to show:ECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) came with built-in Reflect object. It is possible to delete object property by calling Reflect.deleteProperty() function with target object and property key as parameters:which is equivalent to:But if the property of the object is not configurable it cannot be deleted neither with deleteProperty function nor delete operator:Object.freeze() makes all properties of object not configurable (besides other things). deleteProperty function (as well as delete operator) returns false when tries to delete any of it\'s properties. If property is configurable it returns true, even if property does not exist.The difference between delete and deleteProperty is when using strict mode:I personally use Underscore.js for object and array manipulation:This post is very old and I find it very helpful so I decided to share the unset function I wrote in case someone else see this post and think why it\'s not so simple as it in PHP unset function.The reason for writing this new unset function, is to keep the index of all other variables in this hash_map. Look at the following example, and see how the index of "test2" did not change after removing a value from the hash_map.There are a lot of good answers here but I just want to chime in that when using delete to remove a property in JavaScript, it is often wise to first check if that property exists to prevent errors.E.gDue to the dynamic nature of JavaScript there are often cases where you simply don\'t know if the property exists or not. Checking if obj exists before the && also makes sure you don\'t throw an error due to calling the hasOwnProperty() function on an undefined object.Sorry if this didn\'t add to your specific use case but I believe this to be a good design to adapt when managing objects and their properties.If you want to delete a property deeply nested in the object then you can use the following recursive function with path to the property as the second argument:Example: Using ramda#dissoc you will get a new object without the attribute regex:You can also use other functions to achieve the same effect - omit, pick, ...Another solution, using Array#reduce.Using delete method is the best way to do that, as per MDN description, the delete operator removes a property from an object. so you can simply write:The delete operator removes a given property from an object. On\n  successful deletion, it will return true, else false will be returned.\n  However, it is important to consider the following scenarios:If the property which you are trying to delete does not exist, delete\n  will not have any effect and will return trueIf a property with the same name exists on the object\'s prototype\n  chain, then, after deletion, the object will use the property from the\n  prototype chain (in other words, delete only has an effect on own\n  properties).Any property declared with var cannot be deleted from the global scope\n  or from a function\'s scope.As such, delete cannot delete any functions in the global scope (whether this is part from a function definition or a function  (expression). Functions which are part of an object (apart from the\n  global scope) can be deleted with delete.Any property declared with let or const cannot be deleted from the scope  within which they were defined. Non-configurable properties cannot be removed. This includes properties of built-in objects like Math, Array, Object and properties that are created as non-configurable with methods like Object.defineProperty().The following snippet gives another simple example:For more info about and seeing more example, visit the link below:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/deleteTry the following method. Assign the Object property value to undefined. Then stringify the object and parse.You can simply delete any property of an object using the delete keyword.For example:To remove any property, say key1, use the delete keyword like this:Or you can also use array-like notation:Ref: MDN.Try thisHello You Can try this simple an sortDan\'s assertion that \'delete\' is very slow and the benchmark he posted were doubted. So I carried out the test myself in Chrome 59. It does seem that \'delete\' is about 30 times slower:Note that I purposedly carried out more than one \'delete\' operations in one loop cycle to minimize the effect caused by the other operations.Using lodashUsing RamdaVery simple:
