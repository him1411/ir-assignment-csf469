How do I display the content of a JavaScript object in a string format like when we alert a variable?The same formatted way I want to display an object.If you want to print the object for debugging purposes, I suggest instead installing Firebug for Firefox and using the code:Use native JSON.stringify method.\nWorks with nested objects and all major browsers support this method.Link to Mozilla API Reference and other examples.Edit (17/02/2014): Use a custom JSON.stringify replacer if you\n  encounter this Javascript errorWell, Firefox (thanks to @Bojangles for detailed information) has Object.toSource() method which prints objects as JSON and function(){}.That\'s enough for most debugging purposes, I guess.console.dir(object):Displays an interactive listing of the properties of a specified JavaScript object. This listing lets you use disclosure triangles to examine the contents of child objects.This will print the stringify version of object. So instead of [object] as an output you will get the content of object.If you want to use alert, to print your object, you can do this:alert("myObject is " + myObject.toSource());It should print each property and its corresponding value in string format.Function:Usage:Example:http://jsfiddle.net/WilsonPage/6eqMn/In NodeJS you can print an object by using util.inspect(obj). Be sure to state the depth or you\'ll only have a shallow print of the object. http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inspect_object_optionsIf you would like to see data in tabular format you can useTable can be sorted if you click on the table column.You can also select what columns to show:You can find more information about console.table hereAs it was said before best and most simply way i found was Use this:I needed a way to recursively print the object, which pagewil\'s answer provided (Thanks!). I updated it a little bit to include a way to print up to a certain level, and to add spacing so that it is properly indented based on the current level that we are in so that it is more readable.Usage:If you would like to print the object of its full length, can use console.log(require(\'util\').inspect(obj, {showHidden: false, depth: null})If you want to print the object by converting it to the string thenconsole.log(JSON.stringify(obj));Reinventing the wheel here! None of these solutions worked for my situation. So, I quickly doctored up pagewil\'s answer. This one is not for printing to screen (via console, or textfield or whatever). It is, however, for data transport. This version seems to return a very similar result as toSource(). I\'ve not tried JSON.stringify, but I assume this is about the same thing. The result of this function is a valid Javascript object declaration.I wouldn\'t doubt if something like this was already on SO somewhere, but it was just shorter to make it than to spend a while searching past answers. And since this question was my top hit on google when I started searching about this; I figured putting it here might help others.Anyhow, the result from this function will be a string representation of your object, even if your object has embedded objects and arrays, and even if those objects or arrays have even further embedded objects and arrays. (I heard you like to drink? So, I pimped your car with a cooler, and then I pimped your cooler a cooler so your cooler can drink while your being cool.)Arrays are stored with [] instead of {} and thus dont have key/value pairs, just values. Like regular arrays. Therefore, they get created like arrays do.Also, all string (including key names) are quoted, this is not necessary unless those strings have special characters (like a space or a slash). But, I didn\'t feel like detecting this just to remove some quotes that would otherwise still work fine.This resulting string can then be used with eval or just dumping it into a var thru string manipulation. Thus, re-creating your object again, from text.Let me know if I messed it all up, works fine in my testing. Also, the only way I could think of to detect type array was to check for the presence of length. Because Javascript really stores arrays as objects, I cant actually check for type array (there is no such type!). If anyone else knows a better way, I would love to hear it. Because, if your object also has a property named length then this function will mistakenly treat it as an array.EDIT: Added check for null valued objects. Thanks Brock AdamsEDIT: Below is the fixed function to be able to print infinitely recursive objects. This does not print the same as toSource from FF because toSource will print the infinite recursion one time, where as, this function will kill it immediately. This function runs slower, so I\'m adding it here instead of editing the above function, as its only needed if you plan to pass objects that link back to themselves, somewhere.Test:Result:NOTE: Trying to print document.body is a terrible example. For one, FF just prints an empty object string when using toSource. And when using the  function above, FF crashes on SecurityError: The operation is insecure.. And Chrome will crash on Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded. Clearly, document.body was not meant to be converted to string. Because its either too large, or against security policy to access certain properties. Unless,  I messed something up here, do tell!To print the full object with Node.js with colors as a bonus:Colors are of course optional, \'depth: null\' will print the full object.The options don\'t seem to be supported in browsers.References:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/dirhttps://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_dir_obj_optionsI always use console.log("object will be: ", obj, obj1).\nthis way I don\'t need to do the workaround with stringify with JSON.\nAll the properties of the object will be expanded nicely.where object is your objector you can use this in chrome dev tools, "console" tab:console.log(object);Assume object obj = {0:\'John\', 1:\'Foo\', 2:\'Bar\'}Print object\'s contentConsole output (Chrome DevTools) :Hope that helps!Javascript FunctionPrinting Objectvia print_r in JavascriptA little helper function I always use in my projects for simple, speedy debugging via the console. \n Inspiration taken from Laravel.Usagedd(123.55); outputs:\n One of the best and easy way is to use the console.dir();i used pagewil\'s print method, and it worked very nicely. here is my slightly extended version with (sloppy) indents and distinct prop/ob delimiters:Another modification of pagewils code... his doesn\'t print out anything other than strings and leaves the number and boolean fields blank and I fixed the typo on the second typeof just inside the function as created by megaboss.probably you are looking for this one console.dir()Here\'s function.It can show object using tab indent with readability.
