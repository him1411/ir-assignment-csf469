What status code should I set for UPDATE (PUT) and DELETE (e.g. product successfully updated)?For a PUT request: HTTP 200 or HTTP 204 should imply "resource updated successfully".For a DELETE request: HTTP 200 or HTTP 204 should imply "resource deleted successfully". HTTP 202 can also be returned which would imply that the instruction was accepted by the server and the "resource was marked for deletion".9.6 PUTIf an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes > SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.9.7 DELETEA successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted but the response does not include an entity. Source: w3.org: HTTP/1.1 Method DefinitionsHTTP 200 OK: Standard response for successful HTTP\n  requests. The actual response will\n  depend on the request method used.HTTP 204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any contentSource: List of HTTP status codes: 2xx SuccessShort answer: for both PUT and DELETE, you should send either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). Long answer: here\'s a complete decision diagram (click to magnify).Source: https://github.com/for-GET/http-decision-diagramHere are some Tips:DELETE200 (if your want send some additional data in the Response) or 204 (recommended).202 Operation deleted has not been committed yet.If there\'s nothing to delete, use 204 or 404 (DELETE operation is idempotent, delete an already deleted item is operation successful, so you can return 204, but it\'s true that idempotent doesn\'t necessarily imply the same response)Other errors:PUTIf you\'re updating an element of a collectionThe referenced element doesn\'t exists:404 If you don\'t want to create elements via PUT.400 Bad Request (Malformed syntax or a bad query more common than in case of DELETE).RFC 2616 describes which status codes to use.And no, it\'s not always 200.In addition to 200 and 204, 205 (Reset Content) could be a valid response.The server has fulfilled the request and the user agent SHOULD reset the document view which caused the request to be sent ... [e.g.] clearing of the form in which the input is given.Since the question delves into if DELETE "should" return 200 vs 204 it is worth considering that some people recommend returning an entity with links so the preference is for 200."Instead of returning 204 (No Content), the API should be helpful and\n  suggest places to go. In this example I think one obvious link to\n  provide is to" \'somewhere.com/container/\' (minus \'resource\') "- the container from which\n  the client just deleted a resource. Perhaps the client wishes to\n  delete more resources, so that would be a helpful link."http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/04/30/rest-lesson-learned-avoid-204-responses/If a client encounters a 204 response, it can either give up, go to\n  the entry point of the API, or go back to the previous resource it\n  visited. Neither option is particularly good.Personally I would not say 204 is wrong (neither does the author; he says "annoying") because good caching at the client side has many benefits. Best is to be consistent either way.In June 2014 RFC7231 obsoletes RFC2616.\nIf you are doing REST over HTTP then RFC7231 describes exactly what behaviour is expected from GET, PUT, POST and DELETE
