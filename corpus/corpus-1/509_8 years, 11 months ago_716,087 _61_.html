What is the best method for adding options to a select from a JSON object using jQuery?I\'m looking for something that I don\'t need a plugin to do, but would also be interested in the plugins that are out there.This is what I did:A clean/simple solution:This is a cleaned up and simplified version of matdumsa\'s:Changes from matdumsa\'s: (1) removed the close tag for the option inside append() and (2) moved the properties/attributes into an map as the second parameter of append().Same as other answers, in jQuery fashion:In this way you "touch the DOM" only one time. \nI\'m not sure if the latest line can be converted into $(\'#mySelect\').html(output.join(\'\')) because I don\'t know jquery internals (maybe it does some parsing in the html() method)\nThis is slightly faster and cleaner.jQuerypure javascriptUsing DOM Elements Creator plugin (my favorite):Using the Option constructor (not sure about browser support):Using document.createElement (avoiding extra work parsing HTML with $("<option></option>")):This looks nicer, provides readability, but is slower than other methods.If you want speed, the fastest (tested!) way is this, using array, not string concatenation, and using only one append call.All of these answers seem unnecessarily complicated.  All you need is:That is completely cross browser compatible.@joshperryIt seems that plain .append also works as expected,I\'ve done a few tests and this, I believe, does the job the fastest. :PBe forwarned... I am using jQuery Mobile 1.0b2 with PhoneGap 1.0.0 on an Android 2.2 (Cyanogen 7.0.1) phone (T-Mobile G2) and could not get the .append() method to work at all.  I had to use .html() like follows:There\'s an approach using the Microsoft Templating approach that\'s currently under proposal for inclusion into jQuery core. There\'s more power in using the templating so for the simplest scenario it may not be the best option. For more details see Scott Gu\'s post outlining the features.First include the templating js file, available from github.Next set-up a templateThen with your data call the .render() methodI\'ve blogged this approach in more detail.A compromise of sorts between the top two answers, in a "one-liner":Builds up an array of Option elements using map and then appends them all to the Select at once by using apply to send each Option as a separate argument on the append function.I have made something like this, loading a dropdown item via Ajax. The response above is also acceptable, but it is always good to have as little DOM modification as as possible for better performance.So rather than add each item inside a loop it is better to collect items within a loop and append it once it\'s completed.Append it,or even better The simple way is:It works well with jQuery 1.4.1.For complete article for using dynamic lists with ASP.NET MVC & jQuery visit:\nhttp://www.codecapers.com/post/Dynamic-Select-Lists-with-MVC-and-jQuery.aspxThere\'s a sorting problem with this solution in Chrome (jQuery 1.7.1) (Chrome sorts object properties by name/number?)\nSo to keep the order (yes, it\'s object abusing), I changed this:to thisand then the $.each will look like:Although the above are all valid answers - it might be advisable to append all these to a documentFragmnet first, then append that document fragment as an elemet after...see John Resig\'s thoughts on the matter..Something along the lines of:Yet another way of doing it:This manipulates the DOM only once after first building a giant string.Rather than repeating the same code everywhere, I would suggest it is more desirable to write your own JQuery function like:Then to add an option just do the following:You can just iterate over your json array with the following code$(\'<option/>\').attr("value","someValue").text("Option1").appendTo("#my-select-id");A jQuery plugin could be found here: http://remysharp.com/2007/01/20/auto-populating-select-boxes-using-jquery-ajax/.that\'s what i did with two-dimensional array: first column is item i add to innerHTML of the <option>, second column is record_id i add to the value of the <option>:PHPJS/AJAXI found that this is simple and works great.    So best solution is followingif json data resp isuse it asThe JSON Format:And the Jquery to populate the values to the Dropdown on ajax success: I combine the two best answers into a great answer.Using the $.map() function, you can do this in a more elegant way :
