I have a layout similar to this:and would like to use a jQuery selector to select the child img inside the div on click.To get the div, I\'ve got this selector:How can I get the child img using a selector?The jQuery constructor accepts a 2nd parameter called context which can be used to override the context of the selection. Which is the same as using .find() like this:If the imgs you desire are only direct descendants of the clicked element, you can also use .children():You could also usewhich would return all imgs that are descendants of the divIf you need to get the first img that\'s down exactly one level, you can do If your DIV tag is immediately followed by the IMG tag, you can also use:The direct children is You can find all img element of parent div like belowIf you want specific img element you can write like thisYour div contain only one img element. So for this below is rightBut if your div contain more img element like below then you can\'t use upper code to find alt value of second img element. So you can try this:This example shows a general idea that how you can find actual object within parent object.\nYou can use classes to differentiate your child object. That is easy and fun. i.e.You can do this as below :and more specific as:You can use find or children as above code.

I summarized it in the following jQuery: You can use either of the following methods:1 find(): 2 children(): jQuery\'s each is one option:You can use Child Selecor to reference the child elements available within the parent.And the below is if you don\'t have reference to $(this) and you want to reference img available within a div from other function.Also this should work:Here\'s a functional code, you can run it (it\'s a simple demonstration). When you click the DIV you get the image from some different methods, in this situation "this" s the DIV.Hope it helps!You may have 0 to many <img> tags inside of your <div>.  To find an element, use a .find().  To keep your code safe, use a .each().  Using .find() and .each() together prevents null reference errors in the case of 0 <img> elements while also allowing for handling of multiple <img> elements.
