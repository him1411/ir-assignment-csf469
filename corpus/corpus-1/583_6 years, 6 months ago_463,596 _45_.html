What is the command that is used to exit?Call the global process object\'s exit method:From the docs:Ends the process with the specified code. If omitted, exit uses the \'success\' code 0.To exit with a \'failure\' code:The shell that executed node should see the exit code as 1.From the official nodejs.org documentation:Ends the process with the specified code. If omitted, exit uses the \'success\' code 0.To exit with a \'failure\' code:If you\'re in a Unix terminal or Windows command line and want to exit the Node REPL, either...From the command line, .exit is what you want:It\'s documented in the REPL docs. REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) is what the Node command line is called.From a normal program, use process.exit([code]).Just a note that using process.exit([number]) is not recommended practice.The reason this is problematic is because writes to process.stdout in\n  Node.js are non-blocking and may occur over multiple ticks of the\n  Node.js event loop. Calling process.exit(), however, forces the\n  process to exit before those additional writes to stdout can be\n  performed.Rather than calling process.exit() directly, the code should set the\n  process.exitCode and allow the process to exit naturally by avoiding\n  scheduling any additional work for the event loop:If you can you should set the exit code and allow Node to exit gracefully:It depends on the reason why you\'re willing to exit node.js process, but in any case process.exit() is the last option to consider. A quote from documentation:It is important to note that calling process.exit() will force the\n  process to exit as quickly as possible even if there are still\n  asynchronous operations pending that have not yet completed fully,\n  including I/O operations to process.stdout and process.stderr.In most situations, it is not actually necessary to call\n  process.exit() explicitly. The Node.js process will exit on it\'s own\n  if there is no additional work pending in the event loop. The\n  process.exitCode property can be set to tell the process which exit\n  code to use when the process exits gracefully.Let\xe2\x80\x99s cover possible reasons why you might be willing to exit node.js process and why you should avoid process.exit():If script has reached its end and node interpreter doesn\'t exit, it indicates that some async operations are still pending. It\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to force process termination with process.exit() at this point. It\xe2\x80\x99s better to try to understand what is holding your script from exiting in expected way. And when you settle this, you can use process.exitCode to return any result to calling process.For example, if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to gracefully shut down an express app. Unlike command line script, express app keeps running infinitely, waiting for new requests. process.exit() will be a bad option here because it\xe2\x80\x99s going to interrupt all requests which are in pipeline. And some of them might be non-idempotent (UPDATE, DELETE). Client will never know if those requests are completed or not on server side and it might be the reason of data inconsistency between client and server. The only good solution is to tell http server to stop accepting new requests and wait for pending ones to finish with server.close():If it still doesn\'t exit - see Case 1.It\'s always better to throw an error, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a nicely formatted stack trace and error message. Upper levels of code can always decide if they can handle error (catch) or let it crash the process. On the other side, process.exit(1) will terminate process silently and there will be no chance to recover from this. It might be the only \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit\xe2\x80\x9d of process.exit(), you can be sure that process will be terminated.I have an application which I wanted to:I had to hook process.exit(code) to an exit event handler, or else the mail will not be sent since calling process.exit(code) directly kills asynchronous events.REPL(Command Line)Press ctrl + c twiceType .exit and press enterScript FileNode normally exits with code 0 when no more async operations are pending.process.exit(1) should be used to exit with a failure code.This will allow us to infer that node didn\'t close gracefully and was forced to close. There are other exit codes like3 - Internal JavaScript Parse Error ( very very rare)5 - Fatal error in v8 javascript engine9 - Invalid argumentFor full list see node exit codesFrom code you can use process.exit([errorcode]) where [errorcode] is an optional integer (0 is the default to indicate success).If you\'re using the Read Eval Print Loop (REPL), you can use Ctrl + D, or type .exitAlternatively, on Windows or Linux you can use Ctrl + C, Ctrl + COn Mac the command is Ctrl + Z, Ctrl + ZAs @Dominic pointed out, throwing an uncaught error is better practice instead of calling process.exit([code]):\nprocess.exitCode = 1;\nthrow new Error("my module xx condition failed");To exitUseful exit codes
