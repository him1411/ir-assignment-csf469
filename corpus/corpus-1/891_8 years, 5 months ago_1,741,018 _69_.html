Is it possible to redirect a user to a different page through the use of PHP?Say the user goes to www.example.com/page.php and I want to redirect them to www.example.com/index.php, how would I do so without the use of a meta refresh? Possible?This could even protect my pages from unauthorized users.Summary of existing answers plus my own two cents:You can use the header() function to send a new HTTP header, but this must be sent to the browser before any HTML or text (so before the <!DOCTYPE ...> declaration, for example).die() or exit()Why you should use die() or exit(): The Daily WTFAbsolute URLThe URL must be an absolute. See RFC 2616. But in most cases a relative URL will be accepted too.Status CodesPHP\'s "Location"-header still uses the HTTP 302-redirect code, but this is not the one you should use. You should consider either 301 (permanent redirect) or 303 (other).Note: W3C mentions that the 303-header is incompatible with "many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents. Currently used browsers are all HTTP/1.1 user agents. This is not true for many other user agents like spiders and robots.HTTP Headers and the header() function in PHPYou may use the alternative method of http_redirect($url); which needs the PECL package pecl to be installed.This function doesn\'t incorporate the 303 status code:This is more flexible:As mentioned header() redirects only work before anything is written out. They usually fail if invoked inmidst HTML output. Then you might use a HTML header workaround (not very professional!) like:Or a Javascript redirect even.Don\'t forget to die()/exit()!Output JavaScript from PHP using echo, which will do the job.You can\'t really do it in PHP unless you buffer the page output and then later check for redirect condition. That might be too much of a hassle. Remember that headers are the first thing that is sent from the page. Most of the redirect is usually required later in the page. For that you have to buffer all the output of the page and check for redirect condition later. At that point you can either redirect page user header() or simply echo the buffered output.For more about buffering (advantages)What is output buffering?Use header() function to send HTTP Location header:Contrary to some think, die() has nothing to do with redirection. Use it only if you want to redirect instead of normal execution. example.php:Result or 3 executions:Resuming â€” obligatory die()/exit() is some urban legend, that has nothing to do with actual PHP. Has nothing to do with client "respecting" Location: header. Sending header does not stop PHP execution, regardless of client used.Most of these answers are forgetting a very important step!Leaving that vital second line out might see you end up on The Daily WTF. The problem is that browsers do not have to respect the headers which your page return, so with headers being ignored, the rest of the page will be executed without a redirect.1.using header function with exit()but if you use header function then some times you will get "warning\n  like header already send" to resolve that do not echo or print before sending headers or you can simply use die() or exit() after header function. .2.without headerhere you will not face any problem 3.using header function with ob_start() and ob_end_flush()or if you have already opened php tags, use this: You can also redirect to external pages, eg: Make sure you include  exit() or  include die()Many of these answers are correct, but they assume you have an absolute URL, which may not be the case. If you want to use a relative URL and generate the rest, then you can do something like this...I\'ve already answered this question, but I\'ll do it again since in the meanwhile I\'ve learnt that there are special cases if you\'re running in CLI (redirects cannot happen and thus shouldn\'t exit()) or if your webserver is running PHP as a (F)CGI (it needs a previously set Status header to properly redirect).I\'ve also handled the issue of supporting the different HTTP redirection codes (301, 302, 303 and 307), as it was addressed in the comments of my previous answer, here are the descriptions:You can use session variables to control access to pages and authorize valid users as well.http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.session.phpheader( \'Location: http://www.yoursite.com/new_page.html\' );you can use some java script methods like belowLike others here said, sending the location header with:but you need to do it before you\'ve sent any other output to the browser.Also, if you\'re going to use this to block un-authenticated users from certain pages, like you mentioned, keep in mind that some user agents will ignore this and continue on the current page anyway, so you\'ll need to die() after you send it.In the eve of the semantic web, correctness is something to consider. Unfortunately, PHP\'s "Location"-header still uses the HTTP 302-redirect code, which, strictly, isn\'t the best one for redirection. The one it should use instead, is the 303 one.W3C is kind enough to mention that the 303-header is incompatible with "many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents," which would amount to no browser in current use. So, the 302 is a relic, which shouldn\'t be used....or you could just ignore it, as everyone else...Probably too late to answer this one. Nevertheless, here are my thoughts:IMHO, the best way to re-direct an incoming request would be by using location headers, which goesOnce this statement is executed, and output sent out, the browser will begin re-directing the user.\nHowever, ensure that there hasn\'t been any output (any echo / var_dump) before sending headers, else it will lead to errors.Although this is a quick and dirty way to achieve what was originally asked, yet it would eventually turn out to be an SEO disaster, as this kind of re-direct is always interpreted as a 301 / 302 re-direct, hence search engines will always see your index page as a re-directed page, and not something of a landing page / main page.\nHence it will affect the SEO settings of the website.The best way to Redirect with PHP is the following code...Make sure no code will work afterAll the codes must be executed before the above line.Suppose,Case 1: It will redirect properly to the location (index.php).Case 2:The above code will not redirect to the location(index.php).Hopefully, It is clear.Yes it\'s possible to use PHP, we will redirect to another page, try this one:you can update the header in php: headerThis is regular and normal PHP redirect but you can make a redirecting a page with few second wait below code:You can attempt to use the php header function to do the redirect. You will want to set the output buffer so your browser doesn\'t throw a redirect warning to the screen.
