I want to run a very simple HTTP server. Every GET request to example.com should get index.html served to it but as a regular HTML page (i.e., same experience as when you read normal web pages).Using the code below, I can read the content of index.html. How do I serve index.html as a regular web page?One suggestion below is complicated and requires me to write a get line for each resource (CSS, JavaScript, images) file I want to use. How can I serve a single HTML page with some images, CSS and JavaScript?You can use Connect and ServeStatic with Node.js for this:Install connect and serve-static with NPMCreate server.js file with this content:Run with Node.jsYou can now go to http://localhost:8080/yourfile.htmlSimplest Node.js server is just:Now you can run a server via the following commands:Or, you can try this, which opens your web browser and enables CORS requests:For more options, check out the documentation for http-server on GitHub, or run:Lots of other nice features and brain-dead-simple deployment to NodeJitsu.Feature ForksOf course you can easily top up the features with your own fork.  You might find it\'s already been done in one of the existing 400+ forks of this project:Light Server: An Auto Refreshing AlternativeA nice alternative to http-server is light-server. It supports file watching and auto refreshing and may other features. Add to your directory context menu in Windows ExplorerAuto Refreshing EditorsMost web page editors and IDE tools now include a web server that will watch your source files and auto refresh your web page when they change. The open source text editor Brackets also includes a NodeJS static web server. Just open any HTML file in Brackets, press "Live Preview" and it starts a static server and opens your browser at the page. The browser will **auto refresh whenever you edit and save the HTML file. This especially useful when testing adaptive web sites. Open your HTML page on multiple browsers/window sizes/devices. Save your HTML page and instantly see if your adaptive stuff is working as they all auto refresh.PhoneGap DevelopersIf you\'re coding a hybrid mobile app, you may be interested to know that the PhoneGap team took this auto refresh concept on board with their new PhoneGap App. This is a generic mobile app that can load the HTML5 files from a server during development. This is a very slick trick since now you can skip the slow compile/deploy steps in your development cycle for hybrid mobile apps if you\'re changing JS/CSS/HTML files \xe2\x80\x94 which is what you\'re doing most of the time. They also provide the static NodeJS web server (run phonegap serve) that detects file changes.PhoneGap + Sencha Touch DevelopersI\'ve now extensively adapted the PhoneGap static server & PhoneGap Developer App for Sencha Touch & jQuery Mobile developers. Check it out at Sencha Touch Live. Supports --qr QR Codes and --localtunnel that  proxies your static server from your desktop computer to a URL outside your firewall! Tons of uses.  Massive speed up for hybrid mobile devs.Cordova + Ionic Framework DevelopersLocal server and auto refresh features are baked into the ionic tool. Just run ionic serve from your app folder. Even better ... ionic serve --lab to view auto refreshing side by side views of both iOS and Android.  Check out this gist. I\'m reproducing it here for reference, but the gist has been regularly updated.Node.JS static file web server. Put it in your path to fire up servers in any directory, takes an optional port argument.UpdateThe gist does handle css and js files. I\'ve used it myself. Using read/write in "binary" mode isn\'t a problem. That just means that the file isn\'t interpreted as text by the file library and is unrelated to content-type returned in the response.The problem with your code is you\'re always returning a content-type of "text/plain". The above code does not return any content-type, but if you\'re just using it for HTML, CSS, and JS, a browser can infer those just fine. No content-type is better than a wrong one.Normally the content-type is a configuration of your web server. So I\'m sorry if this doesn\'t solve your problem, but it worked for me as a simple development server and thought it might help some other people. If you do need correct content-types in the response, you either need to explicitly define them as joeytwiddle has or use a library like Connect that has sensible defaults. The nice thing about this is that it\'s simple and self-contained (no dependencies).But I do feel your issue. So here is the combined solution.You don\'t need express. You don\'t need connect. Node.js does http NATIVELY. All you need to do is return a file dependent on the request:A more full example that ensures requests can\'t access files underneath a base-directory, and does proper error handling:I think the part you\'re missing right now is that you\'re sending:If you want a web browser to render the HTML, you should change this to:Step1 (inside command prompt [I hope you cd TO YOUR FOLDER]) : npm install expressStep 2: Create a file server.jsPlease note, you should add WATCHFILE (or use nodemon) too. Above code is only for a simple connection server.STEP 3: node server.js or nodemon server.jsThere is now more easy method if you just want host simple HTTP server.\nnpm install -g http-serverand open our directory and type http-serverhttps://www.npmjs.org/package/http-serverThe fast way:Your way:Rather than dealing with a switch statement, I think it\'s neater to lookup the content type from a dictionary:This is basically an updated version of the accepted answer for connect version 3:I also added a default option so that index.html is served as a default.You don\'t need to use any NPM modules to run a simple server, there\'s a very tiny library called "NPM Free Server" for Node:50 lines of code, outputs if you are requesting a file or a folder and gives it a red or green color if it failed for worked. Less than 1KB in size (minified).Node.js sample app Node Chat has the functionality you want.\nIn it\'s README.textfile\n3. Step is what you are looking for.step1step2step3step4Here is the server.js Here is the util.jsI found a interesting library on npm that might be of some use to you. It\'s called mime(npm install mime or https://github.com/broofa/node-mime) and it can determine the mime type of a file. Here\'s an example of a webserver I wrote using it:This will serve any regular text or image file (.html, .css, .js, .pdf, .jpg, .png, .m4a and .mp3 are the extensions I\'ve tested, but it theory it should work for everything)Here is an example of output that I got with it:Notice the unescape function in the path construction. This is to allow for filenames with spaces and encoded characters.I think you where searching for this.  In your index.html, simply fill it with normal html code - whatever you want to render on it, like:Basically copying the accepted answer, but avoiding creating a js file.Found it very convinient.As of latest version of Express, serve-static has become a separate middleware. Use this to serve: Install serve-static first.if you have node installed on you PC probably you have the NPM, if you don\'t need NodeJS stuff, you can use the serve package for this:1 - Install the package on your PC:2 - Serve your static folder:It will show you which port your static folder is being served, just navigate to the host like:I use below code to start a simple web server which render default html file if no file mentioned in Url.It will render all js, css and image file, along with all html content.Agree on statement "No content-type is better than a wrong one"The way I do it is to first of all install node static server globally via then navigate to the directory that contains your html files and start the static server with static.Go to the browser and type localhost:8080/"yourHtmlFile".I\'m not sure if this is exactly what you wanted, however, you can try changing:to this:This will have the browser client display the file as html instead of plain text.Crazy amount of complicated answers here. If you don\'t intend to process nodeJS files/database but just want to serve static html/css/js/images as your question suggest then simply install the pushstate-server module or similar;Here\'s a "one liner" that will create and launch a mini site. Simply paste that entire block in your terminal in the appropriate directory.Open browser and go to http://localhost:3000. Done.The server will use the app dir as the root to serve files from. To add additional assets just place them inside that directory.A slightly more verbose express 4.x version but that provides directory listing, compression, caching and requests logging in a minimal number of linesMost of the answers above describe very nicely how contents are being served. What I was looking as additional was listing of the directory so that other contents of the directory can be browsed. Here is my solution for further readers:This is one of the fastest solutions i use to quickly see web pages    From then on just enter the directory of your html files and runthen change the device to Nexus 7 landscape.There are already some great solutions for a simple nodejs server. \nThere is a one more solution if you need live-reloading as you made changes to your files.navigate your directory and do it will open browser for you with live-reloading.The simpler version which I\'ve came across is as following. For education purposes, it is best, because it does not use any abstract libraries. Now go to browser and open following:Here image.jpg should be in same directory as this file. \nHope this helps someone :)
