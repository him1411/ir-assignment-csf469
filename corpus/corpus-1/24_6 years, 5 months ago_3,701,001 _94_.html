I have an array of integers, and I\'m using the .push() method to add elements to it.Is there a simple way to remove a specific element from an array? The equivalent of something like array.remove(int);.I have to use core JavaScript - no frameworks are allowed.First, find the index of the element you want to remove:Note: browser support for indexOf is limited; it is not supported in Internet Explorer 7 and 8.Then remove it with splice:The second parameter of splice is the number of elements to remove. Note that splice modifies the array in place and returns a new array containing the elements that have been removed.If you need indexOf in an unsupported browser, try the following polyfill. Find more info about this polyfill here.I don\'t know how you are expecting array.remove(int) to behave. There are three possibilities I can think of that you might be wanting.To remove an element of an array at an index i:If you want to remove every element with value number from the array:If you just want to make the element at index i no longer exist, but you don\'t want the indexes of the other elements to change:In this code example I use "array.filter(...)" function to remove unwanted items from array, this function doesn\'t change the original array and creates a new one. If your browser don\'t support this function (e.g. IE before version 9, or Firefox before version 1.5), consider using the filter polyfill from Mozilla.IMPORTANT ES2015 "() => {}" arrow function syntax is not supported in IE at all, Chrome before 45 version, Firefox before 22 version, Safari before 10 version. To use ES2015 syntax in old browsers you can use BabelJSAn additional advantage of this method is that you can remove multiple itemsIMPORTANT "array.includes(...)" function is not supported in IE at all, Chrome before 47 version, Firefox before 43 version, Safari before 9 version and Edge before 14 version so here is polyfill from MozillaTry it yourself in BabelJS :)ReferenceDepends on whether you want to keep an empty spot or not.If you do want an empty slot, delete is fine:If you don\'t, you should use the splice method:And if you need the value of that item, you can just store the returned array\'s element:In case you want to do it in some order, you can use array.pop() for the last one or array.shift() for the first one (and both return the value of the item too).And if you don\'t know the index of the item, you can use array.indexOf( item ) to get it (in a if() to get one item or in a while() to get all of them). array.indexOf( item ) returns either the index or -1 if not found. A friend was having issues in Internet Explorer 8, and showed me what he did. I told him it was wrong, and he told me he got the answer here. The current top answer will not work in all browsers (Internet Explorer 8 for example), and it will only remove the first occurrence of the item.It loops through the array backwards (since indices and length will change as items are removed) and removes the item if it\'s found. It works in all browsers.There are two major approaches:splice(): anArray.splice(index, 1);delete: delete anArray[index];Be careful when you use delete for an array. It is good for deleting attributes of objects but not so good for arrays. It is better to use splice for arrays.Keep in mind that when you use delete for an array you could get wrong results for anArray.length. In other words, delete would remove the element but wouldn\'t update the value of length property.You can also expect to have holes in index numbers after using delete, e.g. you could end up with having indexes 1,3,4,8,9,11 and length as it was before using delete. \nIn that case, all indexed for loops would crash, since indexes are no longer sequential.If you are forced to use delete for some reason, then you should use for each loops when you need to loop through arrays.There is no need to use indexOf or splice. However, it performs better if you only want to remove one occurrence of an element. Find and move (move):Use indexOf and splice (indexof):Use only splice (splice):Run-times on nodejs for array with 1000 elements (average over 10000 runs):indexof is approximately 10x slower than move. Even if improved by removing the call to indexOf in splice it performs much worse than move. John Resig posted a good implementation:If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to extend a global object, you can do something like the following, instead:But the main reason I am posting this is to warn users against the alternative implementation suggested in the comments on that page (Dec 14, 2007):It seems to work well at first, but through a painful process I discovered it fails when trying to remove the second to last element in an array. For example, if you have a 10-element array and you try to remove the 9th element with this:You end up with an 8-element array. Don\'t know why but I confirmed John\'s original implementation doesn\'t have this problem.Too old to reply, but may it help someone, by providing a predicate instead of a value.NOTE: it will update the given array, and return affected rowsYou can do it easily with filter method:This removes all elements from the array and also works faster then combination of slice and indexOfUnderscore.js can be used to solve issues with multiple browsers. It uses in-build browser methods if present. If they are absent like in the case of older Internet Explorer versions it uses its own custom methods.A simple example to remove elements from array (from the website):If you want a new array with the deleted positions removed, you can always delete the specific element and filter out the array. It might need an extension of the array object for browsers that don\'t implement the filter method but in the long term its easier since all you do is this:Should display [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]Check out this code. It works in every major browser.Call this function You can use ES6. Output : You can use lodash _.pull (mutate array), _.pullAt (mutate array) or _.without (does\'t mutate array), I\'m pretty new to JavaScript and needed this functionality. I merely wrote this:Then when I want to use it:Output - As expected.\n["item1", "item1"]You may have different needs than I, so you can easily modify it to suit them. I hope this helps someone.If you have complex objects in the array you can use filters? \nIn situations where $.inArray or array.splice is not as easy to use. Especially if the objects are perhaps shallow in the array.E.g. if you have an object with an Id field and you want the object removed from an array:A more modern, ECMAScript 2015 (formerly known as Harmony or ES 6) approach. Given:Then:Yielding: You can use Babel and a polyfill service to ensure this is well supported across browsers.Then : Update: This method is recommended only if you cannot use ECMAScript 2015 (formerly known as ES6). If you can use it, other answers here provide much neater implementations.This gist here will solve your problem, and also deletes all occurrences of the argument instead of just 1 (or a specified value).Usage:I know there are a lot of answers already, but many of them seem to over complicate the problem.  Here is a simple, recursive way of removing all instances of a key - calls self until index isn\'t found.  Yes, it only works in browsers with indexOf, but it\'s simple and can be easily polyfilled.Stand-alone functionPrototype methodUse jQuery\'s InArray:Note: inArray will return -1, if the element was not found.Remove by IndexFunction that return a copy of array without the element at index.Remove by ValueFunction that return a copy of array without the Value.Create new array:Add elements to this array:The function indexOf (Returns index or -1 when not found) :Check index of this element (tested with firefox and IE8+):Remove 1 element located at index from the arrayYou can do a backward loop to make sure not to screw up the indexes, if there are multiple instances of the element.I also ran in the situation where I had to remove an element from Array. .indexOf was not working in IE* so sharing my working jQuery.inArray() solution.In CoffeeScript:I think many of the JavaScript instructions are not well thought out for functional programming. Splice returns the deleted element where most of the time you need the reduced array. This is bad.Imagine you are doing a recursive call and have to pass an array with one less item, probably without the current indexed item. Or imagine you are doing another recursive call and has to pass an array with an element pushed.In neither of these cases you can do myRecursiveFunction(myArr.push(c)) or myRecursiveFunction(myArr.splice(i,1)). The first idiot will in fact pass the length of the array and the second idiot will pass the deleted element as a parameter.So what I do in fact... For deleting an array element and passing the resulting to a function as a parameter at the same time I do as followsWhen it comes to push that\'s more silly... I do like,I believe in a proper functional language a method mutating the object it\'s called upon must return a reference to the very object as a result.
