Have a table column I\'m trying to expand and hide: jQuery seems to hide the td elements when I select it by class but not by element name.  For example, why does: Note the HTML below, the second column has the same name for all rows.  How could I create this collection using the name attribute?you can use the attribute selectorAny attribute can be selected using [attribute_name=value] way.\nSee the sample here:If you have something like:You can read all like this:The snippet:You could get the array of elements by name the old fashioned way and pass that array to jQuery.note: the only time you would have a reason to use the "name" attribute should be for checkbox or radio inputs.Or you could just add another class to the elements for selection.(This is what I would do)You can get the name value from an input field using name element in jQuery by:I\'ve done like this and it works:https://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/Frameworks usually use bracket names in forms, like:They can be accessed by:Here\'s a simple solution: $(\'td[name=tcol1]\')You can use any attribute as selector with [attribute_name=value].You can get the element in JQuery by using its ID attribute like this:Personally, what I\'ve done in the past is give them a common class id and used that to select them. It may not be ideal as they have a class specified that may not exist, but it makes the selection a hell of a lot easier. Just make sure you\'re unique in your classnames.i.e. for the example above I\'d use your selection by class. Better still would be to change the class name from bold to \'tcol1\', so you don\'t get any accidental inclusions into the jQuery results. If bold does actually refer to a css class, you can always specify both in the class property - i.e. \'class="tcol1 bold"\'.In summary, you can\'t select by Name, either use a complicated JQuery selector and accept any related performance hit or use Class selectors.You can always limit the JQuery scope by including the table name i.e.That should restrict JQuery from searching the "world". Its could still be classed as a complicated selector, but it quickly constrains any searching to within the table with the ID of \'#tableID\', so keeps the processing to a minimum.An alternative of this if you\'re looking for more than 1 element within #table1 would be to look this up seperately and then pass it to JQuery as this limits the scope, but saves a bit of processing to look it up each time.To hide all td which has name "tcol1"This is the Code which can be helpful.
