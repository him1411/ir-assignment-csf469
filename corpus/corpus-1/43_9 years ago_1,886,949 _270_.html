Also how do LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN and FULL JOIN fit in?Assuming you\'re joining on columns with no duplicates, which is a very common case:An inner join of A and B gives the result of A intersect B, i.e. the inner part of a Venn diagram intersection.An outer join of A and B gives the results of A union B, i.e. the outer parts of a Venn diagram union.ExamplesSuppose you have two tables, with a single column each, and data as follows:Note that (1,2) are unique to A, (3,4) are common, and (5,6) are unique to B.Inner joinAn inner join using either of the equivalent queries gives the intersection of the two tables, i.e. the two rows they have in common.Left outer joinA left outer join will give all rows in A, plus any common rows in B.Right outer joinA right outer join will give all rows in B, plus any common rows in A.Full outer joinA full outer join will give you the union of A and B, i.e. all the rows in A and all the rows in B. If something in A doesn\'t have a corresponding datum in B, then the B portion is null, and vice versa.Also you can consider the following schema for different join types;Source: Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins explained in detail by C.L. MoffattI recommend Jeff\'s blog article. The best description I\'ve ever seen, plus there is a visualization, e.g.:Inner Join:Full Outer Join:The Venn diagrams don\'t really do it for me. They don\'t show any distinction between a cross join and an inner join, for example, or more generally show any distinction between different types of join predicate or provide a framework for reasoning about how they will operate.There is no substitute for understanding the logical processing and it is relatively straightforward to grasp anyway. Source TablesFirst start with a CROSS JOIN (AKA Cartesian Product). This does not have an ON clause and simply returns every permutation of rows from the two tables.SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A CROSS JOIN BInner and Outer joins have an "ON" clause predicate. SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.ColourThe above is the classic equi join.The inner join condition need not necessarily be an equality condition and it need not reference columns from both (or even either) of the tables. Evaluating A.Colour NOT IN (\'Green\',\'Blue\') on each row of the cross join returns.SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON 1 =1The join condition evaluates to true for all rows in the cross join result so this is just the same as a cross join. I won\'t repeat the picture of the 16 rows again.Outer Joins are logically evaluated in the same way as inner joins except that if a row from the left table (for a left join) does not join with any rows from the right hand table at all it is preserved in the result with NULL values for the right hand columns.This simply restricts the previous result to only return the rows where B.Colour IS NULL. In this particular case these will be the rows that were preserved as they had no match in the right hand table and the query returns the single red row not matched in table B. This is known as an anti semi join.It is important to select a column for the IS NULL test that is either not nullable or for which the join condition ensures that any NULL values will be excluded in order for this pattern to work correctly and avoid just bringing back rows which happen to have a NULL value for that column in addition to the un matched rows.Right outer joins act similarly to left outer joins except they preserve non matching rows from the right table and null extend the left hand columns.Full outer joins combine the behaviour of left and right joins and preserve the non matching rows from both the left and the right tables.No rows in the cross join match the 1=0 predicate. All rows from both sides are preserved using normal outer join rules with NULL in the columns from the table on the other side. With a minor amend to the preceding query one could simulate a UNION ALL of the two tables. Note that the WHERE clause (if present) logically runs after the join. One common error is to perform a left outer join and then include a WHERE clause with a condition on the right table that ends up excluding the non matching rows. The above ends up performing the outer join...... And then the "Where" clause runs. NULL= \'Green\' does not evaluate to true so the row preserved by the outer join ends up discarded (along with the blue one) effectively converting the join back to an inner one. If the intention was to include only rows from B where Colour is Green and all rows from A regardless the correct syntax would beSee these examples run live at SQLFiddle.com.The following was taken from the article "MySQL - LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN, INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN" by Graham Ellis on his blog Horse\'s Mouth.In a database such as MySQL, data is divided into a number of tables which are then connected (Joined) together by JOIN in SELECT commands to read records from multiple tables. Read this example to see how it works.First, some sample data:REGULAR JOINIf we do a regular JOIN (with none of the keywords INNER, OUTER, LEFT or RIGHT), then we get all records that match in the appropriate way in the two tables, and records in both incoming tables that do not match are not reported:LEFT JOINIf we do a LEFT JOIN, we get all records that match in the same way and IN ADDITION we get an extra record for each unmatched record in the left table of the join - thus ensuring (in this example) that every PERSON gets a mention:RIGHT JOINIf we do a RIGHT JOIN, we get all the records that match and IN ADDITION  an extra record for each unmatched record in the right table of the join - in my example, that means that each property gets a mention even if we don\'t have seller details:An INNER JOIN does a full join, just like the first example, and the word OUTER may be added after the word LEFT or RIGHT in the last two examples - it\'s provided for ODBC compatibility and doesn\'t add an extra capabilities.Retrieve the matched rows only, that is, A intersect B.Select all records from the first table, and any records in the second\ntable that match the joined keys.Select all records from the second table, and any records in the first\ntable that match the joined keys.Inner and outer joins SQL examples and the Join blockSQL: JOINSIn simple words:An inner join retrieve the matched rows only.Whereas an outer join retrieve the matched rows from one table and all rows in other table ....the result depends on which one you are using:Left: Matched rows in the right table and all rows in the left tableRight: Matched rows in the left table and all rows in the right table or Full: All rows in all tables. It doesn\'t matter if there is a match or notA inner join only shows rows if there is a matching record on the other (right) side of the join.A (left) outer join shows rows for each record on the left hand side, even if there are no matching rows on the other (right) side of the join. If there is no matching row, the columns for the other (right) side would show NULLs.Joins are used to combine the data from two tables, with the result being a new, temporary table. Joins are performed based on something called a predicate, which specifies the condition to use in order to perform a join.  The difference between an inner join and an outer join is that an inner join will return only the rows that actually match based on the join predicate.\nLets consider Employee and Location table:Inner Join:\nInner join creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (Employee and Location) based upon the join-predicate. The query compares each row of Employee with each row of Location to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the join-predicate. When the join-predicate is satisfied by matching non-NULL values, column values for each matched pair of rows of Employee and Location are combined into a result row.\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what the SQL for an inner join will look like:Now, here is what the result of running that SQL would look like:\n\nOuter Join:\nAn outer join does not require each record in the two joined tables to have a matching record. The joined table retains each record\xe2\x80\x94even if no other matching record exists. Outer joins subdivide further into left outer joins and right outer joins, depending on which table\'s rows are retained (left or right).Left Outer Join\nThe result of a left outer join (or simply left join) for tables Employee and Location always contains all records of the "left" table (Employee), even if the join-condition does not find any matching record in the "right" table (Location).\nHere is what the SQL for a left outer join would look like, using the tables above:Now, here is what the result of running this SQL would look like:\n\nRight Outer Join\nA right outer join (or right join) closely resembles a left outer join, except with the treatment of the tables reversed. Every row from the "right" table (Location) will appear in the joined table at least once. If no matching row from the "left" table (Employee) exists, NULL will appear in columns from Employee for those records that have no match in Location.\nThis is what the SQL looks like:Using the tables above, we can show what the result set of a right outer join would look like:Full Outer Joins\nFull Outer Join or Full Join is to retain the nonmatching information by including nonmatching rows in the results of a join, use a full outer join. It includes all rows from both tables, regardless of whether or not the other table has a matching value.\nImage SourceInner joins require that a record with a related ID exist in the joined table.Outer joins will return records for the left side even if nothing exists for the right side.For instance, you have an Orders and an OrderDetails table. They are related by an "OrderID".OrdersOrderDetailsThe requestwill only return Orders that also have something in the OrderDetails table.If you change it to OUTER LEFT JOINthen it will return records from the Orders table even if they have no OrderDetails records.You can use this to find Orders that do not have any OrderDetails indicating a possible orphaned order by adding a where clause like WHERE OrderDetails.OrderID IS NULL.In simple words : Inner join -> Take ONLY common records from parent and child tables WHERE primary key of Parent table matches Foreign key in Child table.Left join -> pseudo codeRight join : Exactly opposite of left join . Put name of table in LEFT JOIN at right side in Right join , you get same output as LEFT JOIN.Outer join : Show all records in Both tables No matter what. If records in Left table are not matching to right table based on Primary , Forieign key , use NULL value as result of join . Example :Lets assume now for 2 tables 1.employees  , 2.phone_numbers_employeesHere , employees table is Master table , phone_numbers_employees is child table(it contains emp_id as foreign key which connects employee.id so its child table.)Inner joins Take the records of 2 tables ONLY IF Primary key of employees table(its id) matches Foreign key of Child table phone_numbers_employees(emp_id).So query would be :Here take only matching rows on primary key = foreign key as explained above.Here non matching rows on primary key = foreign key are skipped as result of join.Left joins :Left join retains all rows of the left table, regardless of whether there is a row that matches on the right table.Outer joins :Diagramatically it looks like :You use INNER JOIN to return all rows from both tables where there is a match. i.e. In the resulting table all the rows and columns will have values.In OUTER JOIN the resulting table may have empty columns. Outer join may be either LEFT or RIGHT.LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all the rows from the first table, even if there are no matches in the second table.RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns all the rows from the second table, even if there are no matches in the first table.This is a good diagrammatic explanation for all kind of joinssource: http://ssiddique.info/understanding-sql-joins-in-easy-way.htmlINNER JOIN requires there is at least a match in comparing the two tables. For example, table A and table B which implies A \xd9\xa8 B (A intersection B).LEFT OUTER JOIN and LEFT JOIN are the same. It gives all the records matching in both tables and all possibilities of the left table.Similarly, RIGHT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT JOIN are the same. It gives all the records matching in both tables and all possibilities of the right table.FULL JOIN is the combination of LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN without duplication.In SQL, A   join is used to compare and combine \xe2\x80\x94 literally join \xe2\x80\x94 and return specific rows of data from two or more tables in a database. An inner join finds and returns matching data from tables, while an outer join finds and returns matching data and some dissimilar data from tables.Inner JoinAn inner join focuses on the commonality between two tables. When using an inner join, there must be at least some matching data between two (or more) tables that are being compared. An inner join searches tables for matching or overlapping data. Upon finding it, the inner join combines and returns the information into one new table.Example of Inner JoinLet\'s consider a common scenario of two tables: product prices and quantities. The common information in the two tables is product name, so that is the logical column to join the tables on. There are some products that are common in the two tables; others are unique to one of the tables and don\'t have a match in the other table.An inner join on Products returns information about only those products that are common in both tables. Outer JoinAn outer join returns a set of records (or rows) that include what an inner join would return but also includes other rows for which no corresponding match is found in the other table.There are three types of outer joins:Left Outer JoinA left outer join will return all the data in Table 1 and all the shared data (so, the inner part of the Venn diagram example), but only corresponding data from Table 2, which is the right join.Left Join ExampleIn my example database, there are two products \xe2\x80\x94 oranges and tomatoes \xe2\x80\x94 on the \'left\' (Prices table) that do not have a corresponding entry on the \'right\' (Quantities table). In a left join, these rows are included in the result set with a NULL in the Quantity column. The other rows in the result are the same as the inner join.Right Outer JoinA right outer join returns Table 2\'s data and all the shared data, but only corresponding data from Table 1, which is the left join.Right Join ExampleSimilar to the left join example, the output of a right outer join includes all rows of the inner join and two rows \xe2\x80\x94 broccoli and squash \xe2\x80\x94 from the \'right\' (Quantities table) that do not have matching entries on the left.Full Outer JoinA full outer join, or full join, which is not supported by the popular MySQL database management system, combines and returns all data from two or more tables, regardless of whether there is shared information. Think of a full join as simply duplicating all the specified information, but in one table, rather than multiple tables. Where matching data is missing, nulls will be produced.The answer is in the meaning of each one, so in the results.Note :\n  In SQLite there is no RIGHT OUTER JOIN or FULL OUTER JOIN.\n  And also in MySQL there is no FULL OUTER JOIN.My answer is based on above Note.When you have two tables like these: CROSS JOIN / OUTER JOIN :\nYou can have all of those tables data with CROSS JOIN or just with , like this:INNER JOIN :\nWhen you want to add a filter to above results based on a relation like table1.id = table2.id you can use INNER JOIN:LEFT [OUTER] JOIN :\nWhen you want to have all rows of one of tables in the above result -with same relation- you can use LEFT JOIN:\n(For RIGHT JOIN just change place of tables)FULL OUTER JOIN :\nWhen you also want to have all rows of the other table in your results you can use FULL OUTER JOIN:Well, as your need you choose each one that covers your need ;).The difference is in the way tables are joined if there are no common records.JOIN is same as INNER JOIN and means to only show records common to both tables. Whether the records are common is determined by the fields in join clause. For example:means show only records where the same ID value exists in both tables.LEFT JOIN is same as LEFT OUTER JOIN and means to show all records from left table (i.e. the one that precedes in SQL statement) regardless of the existance of matching records in the right table.Source: What\'s the difference between LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, OUTER, JOIN?Inner join. A join is combining the rows from two tables. An inner join attempts to match up the two tables based on the criteria you specify in the query, and only returns the rows that match. If a row from the first table in the join matches two rows in the second table, then two rows will be returned in the results. If there\xe2\x80\x99s a row in the first table that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match a row in the second, it\xe2\x80\x99s not returned; likewise, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a row in the second table that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match a row in the first, it\xe2\x80\x99s not returned.Outer Join. A left join attempts to find match up the rows from the first table to rows in the second table. If it can\xe2\x80\x99t find a match, it will return the columns from the first table and leave the columns from the second table blank (null).I don\'t see much details about performance and optimizer in the other answers.Sometimes it is good to know that only INNER JOIN is associative which means the optimizer has the most option to play with it. It can reorder the join order to make it faster keeping the same result. The optimizer can use the most join modes.Generally it is a good practice to try to use INNER JOIN instead of the different kind of joins. (Of course if it is possible considering the expected result set.)There are a couple of good examples and explanation here about this strange associative behavior:The difference is in the way tables are joined if there are no common records.JOIN is same as INNER JOIN and means to only show records common to both tables. Whether the records are common is determined by the fields in join clause. For example:It means show only records where the same ID value exists in both tables.LEFT JOIN is same as LEFT OUTER JOIN and means to show all records from left table (i.e. the one that precedes in SQL statement) regardless of the existence of matching records in the right table.RIGHT JOIN is same as RIGHT OUTER JOIN and means opposite of LEFT JOIN, i.e. shows all records from the second (right) table and only matching records from first (left) table. Having criticized the much-loved red-shaded Venn diagram, I thought it only fair to post my own attempt.Although @Martin Smith\'s answer is the best of this bunch by a long way, his only shows the key column from each table, whereas I think ideally non-key columns should also be shown.The best I could do in the half hour allowed, I still don\'t think it adequately shows that the nulls are there due to absence of key values in TableB or that OUTER JOIN is actually a union rather than a join:Inner Join\nAn inner join focuses on the commonality between two tables. When using an inner join, there must be at least some matching data between two (or more) tables that are being compared. An inner join searches tables for matching or overlapping data. Upon finding it, the inner join combines and returns the information into one new table.Outer Join\nAn outer join returns a set of records (or rows) that include what an inner join would return but also includes other rows for which no corresponding match is found in the other table.There are three types of outer joins:Left Outer Join (or Left Join)\nRight Outer Join (or Right Join)\nFull Outer Join (or Full Join)\nEach of these outer joins refers to the part of the data that is being compared, combined, and returned. Sometimes nulls will be produced in this process as some data is shared while other data is not.The precise algorithm for INNER JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT OUTER JOIN are like as following: Note: the condition specified in ON clause could be anything, it is not required to use Primary Keys and you don\'t need to always refer to Columns from both tables! For example:You can see also this answer in current page for more samples.Simplest DefinitionsInner Join: Returns matched records from both tables.Full Outer Join: Returns matched and unmatched records from both tables with null for unmatched records from Both Tables.Left Outer Join: Returns matched and unmatched records only from table on Left Side.Right Outer Join: Returns matched and unmatched records only from table on Right Side.In-ShortMatched + Left Unmatched + Right Unmatched = Full Outer JoinMatched + Left Unmatched = Left Outer JoinMatched + Right Unmatched = Right Outer JoinMatched = Inner JoinINNER JOINAn inner join produces a result set that is limited to the rows where there is a match in both tables for what we\'re looking for.  If you don\'t know which kind of join you need, this will usually be your best bet.LEFT OUTER JOINA left outer join, or left join, results in a set where all of the rows from the first, or left hand side, table are preserved. The rows from the second, or right hand side table only show up if they have a match with the rows from the first table.  Where there are values from the left table but not from the right, the table will read null, which means that the value has not been set. RIGHT OUTER JOINA right outer join, or right join, is the same as a left join, except the roles are reversed.  All of the rows from the right hand side table show up in the result, but the rows from the table on the left are only there if they match the table on the right.  Empty spaces are null, just like with the the left join.  FULL OUTER JOINA full outer join, or just outer join, produces a result set with  all of the rows of both tables, regardless of whether there are any matches.  Similarly to the left and right joins, we call the empty spaces null.  For More ReferenceWhat is the difference between \xe2\x80\x9cINNER JOIN\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOUTER JOIN\xe2\x80\x9d?They are the most commonly used existential operators in SQL, where INNER JOIN is used for \'exists\' and LEFT OUTER JOIN is used for \'does not exist\'.Consider these queries:People who look for set-based solutions (an industry term) would recognise the respective queries as:Translating these into standard SQL:Others will think along similar lines of set inclusion:Translating these into standard SQL:Some will think in terms of \'existance\' within sets e.g. Translating these into standard SQL (note we now need to use range variables i.e. p, v, b):However, I\'ve found that the "industry standard" approach is to exclusively use joins. I don\'t know what the thinking is here (Law of the Instrument? Premature optimization?), so I\'ll go staight to the syntax:Things to note:Closing remarks:Sometimes joins are used in queries solely to determine whether values exist or do not exists in another set. Learn to look carefully at the attributes being projected (the columns in the SELECT clause): if there are none from the joined table then they are simply being used as existential operators. Additionally for outer join, look for instances of <key_column> IS NULL.Inner join - An inner join using either of the equivalent queries gives the intersection of the two tables, i.e. the two rows they have in common.Left outer join - A left outer join will give all rows in A, plus any common rows in B.Full outer join - A full outer join will give you the union of A and B, i.e. All the rows in A and all the rows in B. If something in A doesn\'t have a corresponding datum in B, then the B portion is null, and vice versayBoth inner and outer joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables into a single result.  This is done using a join condition.  The join condition specifies how columns from each table are matched to one another.  In most cases the aim is to find equal values between tables, and include those matches.The most common case for this is when you\xe2\x80\x99re matching the foreign key of one table to the primary key of another, such as when using and ID to lookup a value.Though both inner and outer joins include rows from both tables when the match condition is successful, they differ in how they handle a false match condition.Inner joins don\xe2\x80\x99t include non-matching rows; whereas, outer joins do include them. Let\xe2\x80\x99s dig a little deeper into the mechanics of eachInner Join MechanicsAn inner join is used to return results by combining rows from two or more tables.In its simplest case, where there is no join condition, an inner join would combine all rows from one table with those from another.  If the first table contained three rows, and the second, four, then the final result would contain twelve (3 x 4 = 12) !The purpose of the join condition is to limit which rows are combined.  In most cases we limit rows to those matching a column.\nIf a person has more than one phone number, then more than one match is made.  From this you can see we may get more rows returned than we have for each person.Tables to Join Conversely, if a person has no phone number, then there won\xe2\x80\x99t be an entry in PersonPhone, and no match made.  That particular person won\xe2\x80\x99t be included in the results, as only those with matches are included.\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s try an example.\nSuppose the HR Manager wants to create a phone directory.  They want the person\xe2\x80\x99s first name, last name, title, and phone numbers.  What query could you use to create this?\nHere is one that would do the trick:The INNER JOIN specifies which tables to join and the match condition for doing so.  The condition PH.Phone NumberTyeID = 3 limits the query to work numbers.\nIf you run the above, you get the following results:Inner Join Results Keep in mind the inner join only returns row where the match condition is true.  In this example, rows where the BusinessEntityID\xe2\x80\x99s don\xe2\x80\x99t match aren\xe2\x80\x99t included.  This could be an issue if a person doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a phone number as those employees wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on the list.\nIf you wish to include these employees you can use an Outer join.Outer Join MechanicsAn outer join is used to return results by combining rows from two or more tables.  But unlike an inner join, the outer join will return every row from one specified table, even if the join condition fails.\nTake the phone directory example above.  If the HR manager wanted to list every employee regardless of whether they had a work phone number, then using an outer join would make it so.You can learn more about left and right outer joins in this article, for now just understand that when a LEFT OUTER JOIN is used, all rows for the table in the FROM clause are included in the result, even if a match isn\xe2\x80\x99t found with the other table.\nWhen a match isn\xe2\x80\x99t found, then a NULL is place in the column.\nYou can see this in action below:\nOuter Join Results Notice in the example the PhoneNumber for Catherine Abel is NULL.  This is because Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s work number isn\xe2\x80\x99t listed, and no match was found during the join.\nIf this would have been an inner join, then this row wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been included in the results.1.Inner Join: Also called as Join. It returns the rows present in both the Left table, and right table only if there is a match. Otherwise, it returns zero records.Example:2.Full Outer Join: Also called as Full Join. It returns all the rows present in both the Left table, and right table.Example:3.Left Outer join: Or simply called as Left Join. It returns all the rows present in the Left table and matching rows from the right table (if any).4.Right Outer Join: Also called as Right Join. It returns matching rows from the left table (if any), and all the rows present in the Right table.Advantages of JoinsIn Simple Terms,1.INNER JOIN OR EQUI JOIN : Returns the resultset that matches only the condition in both the tables.2.OUTER JOIN : Returns the resultset of all the values from both the tables even if there is condition match or not. 3.LEFT JOIN : Returns the resultset of all the values from left table and only rows that match the condition in right table.4.RIGHT JOIN : Returns the resultset of all the values from right table and only rows that match the condition in left table.5.FULL JOIN : Full Join and Full outer Join are same.
