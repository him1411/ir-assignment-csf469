What is the syntax for storing a comment in a markdown file, e.g. a CVS $Id$ comment at the top of the file? I found nothing on the markdown project.I believe that all the previously proposed solutions (apart from those that require specific implementations) result in the comments being included in the output HTML, even if they are not displayed.If you want a comment that is strictly for yourself (readers of the converted document should not be able to see it, even with "view source") you could (ab)use the link labels (for use with reference style links) that are available in the core Markdown specification:http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#linkThat is:Or you could go further:To improve platform compatibility (and to save one keystroke) it is also possible to use # (which is a legitimate hyperlink target) instead of <>:It may also be prudent to insert a blank line before and after this type of comments, because some Markdown parsers may not like link definitions brushing up against regular text.This should work with most Markdown parsers, since it\'s part of the core specification. (even if the behavior when multiple links are defined, or when a link is defined but never used, is not strictly specified).I use standard HTML tags, likeNote the triple dash. The advantage is that it works with pandoc when generating TeX or HTML output. More information is available on the pandoc-discuss group.This small research proves and refines  the answer by MagnusThe most platform-independent syntax isBoth conditions are important:The strict Markdown specification CommonMark only works as intended with this syntax (and not with <> and/or an empty line)To prove this we shall use the Babelmark2, written by John MacFarlane. This tool checks the rendering of particular source code in 28 Markdown implementations.(+ \xe2\x80\x94 passed the test, - \xe2\x80\x94 didn\'t pass, ? \xe2\x80\x94 leaves some garbage which is not shown in rendered HTML).This proves the statements above. These implementations fail all 6 tests. There\'s no chance to use excluded-on-render comments with them.If you are using Jekyll or octopress following will also work.The Liquid tags {% comment %} are parsed first and removed before the MarkDown processor even gets to it. Visitors will not see when they try to view source from their browser.An alternative is to put comments within stylized HTML tags.  This way, you can toggle their visibility as needed.  For example, define a comment class in your CSS stylesheet.  .comment { display: none; }Then, the following enhanced MARKDOWNWe do <span class="comment">NOT</span> support commentsappears as follows in a BROWSERWe do support commentsThis works on GitHub:The resulting HTML looks like:Which is basically an empty link. Obviously you can read that in the source of the rendered text, but you can do that on GitHub anyway.Also see Critic Markup, supported by an increasing number of Markdown tools.http://criticmarkup.com/Disclosure: I wrote the plugin.Since the question doesn\'t specify a specific markdown implementation I\'d like to mention the Comments Plugin for python-markdown, which implements the same pandoc commenting style mentioned above.How about putting the comments in a non-eval, non-echo R block?  i.e.,Seems to work well for me.Does not work in Pandoc Markdown (Pandoc 1.12.2.1).  Comments still appeared in html.  The following did work:Then use the +footnote extension.  It is essentially a footnote that never gets referenced.Vim Instant-Markdown users need to usekramdown\xe2\x80\x94the Ruby-based markdown engine that is the default for Jekyll and thus GitHub Pages\xe2\x80\x94has built-in comment support through its extension syntax:This has the benefit of allowing in-line comments, but the downside of not being portable to other Markdown engines.You can try For pandoc, a good way to block comment is to use a yaml metablock, as suggested by the pandoc author. I have noticed that this gives more proper syntax highlighting of the comments compared to many of the other proposed solutions, at least in my environment (vim, vim-pandoc, and vim-pandoc-syntax).I use yaml block comments in combination with html-inline comments, since html-comments cannot be nested. Unfortunately, there is no way of block commenting within the yaml metablock, so every line has to be commented individually. Fortunately, there should only be one line in a softwrapped paragraph.In my ~/.vimrc, I have set up custom shortcuts for block comments:I use , as my <Leader>-key, so ,b and ,v comment and uncomment a paragraph, respectively. If I need to comment multiple paragraphs, I map j,b to a macro (usually Q) and run <number-of-paragraphs><name-of-macro> (e.g. (3Q). The same works for uncommenting.
