How do you auto-resize a large image so that it will fit into a smaller width div container whilst maintaining it\'s width:height ratio?Example: stackoverflow.com - when an image is inserted onto the editor panel and the image is too large to fit onto the page, the image is automatically resized. Do not apply an explicit width or height to the image tag. Instead, give it:Example: http://jsfiddle.net/xwrvxser/1/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fitturns out there\'s another way to do this.will do the work. It\'s CSS3 stuff.Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/mbHB4/7364/Currently there is no way to do this correctly in a deterministic way, with fixed-size images such as JPEGs or PNG files.To resize an image proportionally, you have to set either the height or width to "100%", but not both. If you set both to "100%", your image will be stretched.Choosing whether to do height or width depends on your image and container dimensions:If your image is an SVG, which is a variable-sized vector image format, you can have the expansion to fit the container happen automatically.You just have to ensure that the SVG file has none of these properties set in the <svg> tag:Most vector drawing programs out there will set these properties when exporting an SVG file, so you will have to manually edit your file every time you export, or write a script to do it.Here is a solution that will both vertically and horizontally align your img within a div without any stretching even if the image supplied is too small or too big to fit in the div.\nThe html:The CSS:The JQuery:I hope this helps you guys outMake it simple!Give the container a fixed height and then for the img tag inside it set width and max-height.Difference is that you set the width to be 100% not the max-width.Check out my solution: http://codepen.io/petethepig/pen/dvFsAIt\'s written in pure CSS, without any JS code.\nIt can handle images of any size and any orientation.Given such HTML:CSS code would be:You can set the image as the background to a div, then use the css background-size property and it will "Scale the background image to be as large as possible so that the background area is completely covered by the background image. Some parts of the background image may not be in view within the background positioning area" -w3schools.comThis solution doesn\'t stretch the image and fills the whole container, but it cuts some of the image.htmlCSSI just published a jQuery plugin that do exactly what you need with a lot of options : https://github.com/GestiXi/image-scaleUsage:HTMLJSThe accepted answer from Thorn007 doesn\'t work when the image is too small.\nTo solve this, I added a scale factor. This way, it makes the image bigger and it fills the div container.Example :notes:\n1/ for webkit you must add -webkit-transform:scale(4); -webkit-transform-origin:left top; in the style.\n2/ with a scale factor of 4, you have max-width = 400/4 = 100 and max-height = 200/4 = 50\n3/ an alternate solution is to set max-width and max-height at 25%, it\'s even simplerI have much better solution without need of any JS. It is fully responsive and I use it a lot. You often need to fit image of any aspect ratio to container element with specified aspect ratio. And having whole this thing fully responsive is a must.You can set max-width and max height independently, image will respect the smallest one (depending on the values and aspect ratio of the image). You can also set image to be aligned as you want (eg. for product picture on infinite white background you can position it to center bottom easily)Edit: Previous table based image positioning had issues in IE11 (max-height doesn\'t work in display:table elements). I\'ve replaced it with inline based positioning which not only works fine in both IE7 and IE11, but also requires less code.Here is my take on the subject. It\'ll only work if the container has specified size (max-width and max-height don\'t seem to get along with containers that don\'t have concrete size), but I wrote the css in a way that allows it to be reused (add picture-frame class and px125 size class to your existing container).In css:And in html:Edit: Possible further improvement using JS (upscaling images):The code below is adapted from above and tested by me using an image called storm.jpg\nThis is the complete HTML code for a simple page that displays the image. This works perfect and was tested by me with www.resizemybrowser.com.  Put the CSS code at the top of your HTML code, underneath your head section. Put the the picture code wherever you want the picture.I centered and scaled proportionally an image inside a hyperlink both horizontally and vertically this way:Tested in IE, Firefox, Safari.More info about centering is here.You have to tell the browser the height of where you are placing it.Give the height and width you need for your image to the div that contains the < img> tag.\ndon\'t forget to give the height/width in proper style tag.\nIn the < img> tag, give the max-height and max-width as 100%.you can add the details in appropriate classes after you got it right.A  simple solution ( 4-step fix !!) that seem to  work for  me , is   below.  Hope it helps.The example uses the  width to determine the overall size, but you can also flip it to use the height instead.  for exampleAs answered here, you can also use vh units instead of max-height: 100% if it doesn\'t work on your browser (like Chrome):A beautiful hack.You have two ways of making the image responsive.Run it hereRun it hereThe solution is easy with a bit of maths...Just put the image in a div and then in the html file where you specify the image set the width and height values in percentages using the pixel values of the image to calculate the exact ratio of width to height.For example, say you have an image that has a width of 200 pixels and a height of 160 pixels. You can safely say that the width value will be 100% because it is the larger value. To then calculate the height value you simply divide the height by the width which gives the percentage value of 80%. In the code it will look something like this...All the provided answers, including the accepted one, work only under the assumption that the div wrapper is of a fixed size. So this is how to do it whatever the size of the div wrapper is and this is very useful if you develop a responsive page:Write these declarations inside your DIV selector:Then put these declarations inside your IMG selector:VERY IMPORTANT:The value of maxHeight  must be the same for both the DIV and IMG selectors.check my ans https://stackoverflow.com/a/36712112/2439715Simplest way to do this isby using object-fitIf your using bootstrap just add the img-responsive class and changed toOr you can simply use:Now the image will take all the space of the div.Define div simply
