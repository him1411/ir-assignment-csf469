This question is related to Should I be concerned about excess, non-running, Docker containers?.I\'m wondering how to remove old containers. The docker rm 3e552code34a lets you remove a single one, but I have lots already. docker rm --help doesn\'t give a selection option (like all, or by image name).Maybe there is a directory in which these containers are stored where I can delete them easily manually?There is a new feature in Docker 1.13.x called Docker container prune:\ndocker container prune\nThis will do what you want and should work on all platforms the same way.There is also a Docker system prune, which will clean up containers, images, volumes, and networks all in one command.Original Answer:There has been some talk about a Docker cleanup command. You can find the information on this ticket: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/928Until that command is available, you can string Docker commands together with other Unix commands to get what you need. Here is an example on how to clean up old containers that are weeks old:To give credit, where it is due, this example is from https://twitter.com/jpetazzo/status/347431091415703552.Another method, which I got from Guillaume J. Charmes (credit where it is due):will remove all containers in an elegant way.And by Bartosz Bilicki, for Windows:For PowerShell:An update with Docker 1.13 (Q4 2016), credit to VonC (later in this thread):docker system prune will delete ALL unused data (i.e., in order: containers stopped, volumes without containers and images with no containers).See PR 26108 and commit 86de7c0, which are introducing a few new commands to help facilitate visualizing how much space the Docker daemon data is taking on disk and allowing for easily cleaning up "unneeded" excess.Updated Answer\nUse docker system prune or docker container prune now.  See VonC\'s updated answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/39860665/411229Previous Answer\nComposing several different hints above, the most elegant way to remove all non-running containers seems to be:docker rm $(docker ps -q -f status=exited)The official way is:The Docker maintainers have indicated there will be no command for this - and you compose the commands like that:We have discussed this before and prefer users to use the above line without having to add additional code to Docker.It is now possible to use filtering with docker ps:And for images:However, any of those will cause docker rm or docker rmi to throw an error when there are no matching containers. The older docker rm $(docker ps -aq) trick was even worse as it tried to remove any running container, failing at each one.Here\'s a cleaner script to add in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile :Edit: As noted below, original answer was for removing images, not containers. Updated to answer both, including new links to documentation. Thanks to Adrian (and Ryan\'s answer) for mentioning the new ps filtering.With Docker 1.13 (Q4 2016), you now have:docker system prune will delete ALL unused data (i.e., in order: containers stopped, volumes without containers and images with no containers).See PR 26108 and commit 86de7c0, which are introducing a few new commands to help facilitate visualizing how much space the Docker daemon data is taking on disk and allowing for easily cleaning up "unneeded" excess.As wjv comments, There is also docker {container,image,volume,network} prune, which may be used to remove unused instances of just one type of object.  Introduced in commit 913e5cb, only for Docker 1.13+.UPDATED 2017 (NEWEST)This - 2017 (OLD) wayTo remove ALL STOPPED CONTAINERS To remove ALL CONTAINERS (STOPPED AND NON STOPPED)Remove all stopped containers:From the comment by pauk960:Since version 1.3.0 you can use filters with docker ps, instead of grep Exited use docker ps -a -f status=exited. And if you use -q with it you can get container IDs only instead of full output, no need to use awk for that. If you do not like to remove all containers, you can select all containers created before or after a specific container with docker ps --before <container-ID> or with docker ps --since <container-ID>. This feature is at least in docker version 0.6.5.Let\'s say You have developed your system, now it is working but there are a number of containers left. You want to remove containers created before that working version. Determine the ID of the working container with docker ps.Remove containers created before an other containerAnother example. You have your database already running on a docker container. You have developed your application to run on an other container and now You have a number of unneeded containers.Remove containers created after a certain containerDocker stores containers in /var/lib/docker/containers in Ubuntu. I think extra containers do no other harm, but take up disk space.Update: As of Docker version 1.13 (released January 2017), you can issue the following command to clean up stopped containers, unused volumes, dangling images and unused networks:If you want to insure that you\'re only deleting containers which have an exited status, use this:Similarly, if you\'re cleaning up docker stuff, you can get rid of untagged, unnamed images in this way:Here is my docker-cleanup script, which removes untagged containers and images. Please check the source for any updates.Source: https://github.com/blueyed/dotfiles/blob/master/usr/bin/docker-cleanupFirst, stop running containers before attempting to remove them You could use kill instead of stop. In my case I prefer stop since I tend to rerun them vs creating a new one every time so I try to shut them down nicely.Note:  Trying to stop a container will give you an error:Error: Impossible to remove a running container, please stop it firstRemoving all containers from Windows shell:https://github.com/HardySimpson/docker-cleanupA tiny all-in-one shell, which removes:Intend to run as a crontab jobUse:It forcefully stops and removes all containers present locally.So, personally I recommend doing this as part of your deploy script for both images and containers keeping only the most recent n containers and images. I tag my docker images with the same versioning schema I use with git tag as well as always tagging the latest docker image with "latest." This means that without cleaning up anything, my docker images wind up looking like:Now, of course I don\'t want to keep all my images (or containers) going back to perpetuity on all my production boxes. I just want the last 3 or 4 for rollbacks and to get rid of everything else. Unix\'s tail is your best friend here. Since docker images and docker ps both order by date, we can just use tail to select all but the top 3 and remove them:Run that along with your deploy scripts (or locally) to always keep just enough images to comfortably roll back without taking up too much room or cluttering stuff up with old images.Personally, I only keep one container on my production box at any time, but you can do the same sort of thing with containers if you want more:Finally, in my simplified example we\'re only dealing with one repo at a time, but if you had more, you can just get a bit more sophisticated with the same idea. Say I just want to keep the last 3 images from some_repo/some_image. I can just mix in grep and awk and be on my way:Again, same idea applies to containers, but you get it by this point so I\'ll stop giving examples.Remove all stopped containers.sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q)This will remove all stopped containers by getting a list of all containers with docker ps -a -q and passing their ids to docker rm. This should not remove any running containers, and it will tell you it can\xe2\x80\x99t remove a running image.Remove all untagged imagesNow you want to clean up old images to save some space.sudo docker rmi $(sudo docker images -q --filter "dangling=true")Remove 5 oldest containers:See how many containers there are left:New way: \nspotify/docker-gc play the trick.It has supported environmental settingsForcing deletion of images that have multiple tagsForcing deletion of containersExcluding Recently Exited Containers and Images From Garbage CollectionThis setting also prevents the removal of images that have been created less than GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS seconds ago.Dry runCleaning up orphaned container volumes\n     CLEAN_UP_VOLUMES=1Reference: docker-gcOld way to do:delete old, non-running containersdelete all images associated with non-running docker containerscleanup orphaned docker volumes for docker version 1.10.x and aboveBased on time periodYou can use the following command to remove the exited containers:Here is the full gist to also remove the old images on docker: Gist to remove old Docker containers and images.I always use docker rmi $(docker ps -a -q) to remove all images.You can remove directory /var/lib/docker/graph when docker rmi failed.Remove all docker processes: Remove specific container:You can remove only stopped containers. Stop all of them in the beginningdocker stop $(docker ps -a -q)Then you can removedocker rm $(docker ps -a -q)To remove ALL containers without crying:For anyone interested, I took the example from qkrijger and turned it into a clear all (stop and remove all)On Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr):This is just a normal Bash command so it should work with EVERY Bash-compliant terminal.if you want to automatically/periodically clean up exited containers and remove images and volumes that aren\'t in use by a running container you can download this image meltwater/docker-cleanup.I use this on production since we deploy several times a day on multiple servers, and i don\'t want to go to every server to clean up ( that would be a pain).Just run:It will run every 30mins by default (or however long you set it using DELAY_TIME=1800 option) and clean up exited containers and images.More details: https://github.com/meltwater/docker-cleanup/blob/master/README.md
