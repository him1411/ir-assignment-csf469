I\'m trying to use the new Android Studio but I can\'t seem to get it working correctly.I\'m using the Gson library to serialize/deserialize JSON-objects. But the library somehow isn\'t included in the build.I created a new project with just a MainActivity. Copied gson-2.2.3.jar in the /libs folder and added it as a library (right click->Add as library). This includes the jar in android studio so it can be referenced from the source files.When I try to run the project it cannot compile so I added:to the dependencies in de .gradle file. After that it compiles correctly but when running the application I get a ClassDefNotFoundException.Does anyone know what I\'m doing wrong?I\'ve been struggling with the same thing for many hours, trying to get the Gson jar to work no less. I finally cracked it \xe2\x80\x93 here are the steps I took:After I did the above four, it started working fine. I think the \'Add as library\' step was the one I\'d previously missed, and it didn\'t work until I cleaned it either.[Edit - added the build.gradle step which is also necessary as others have pointed out]Here are the instructions for adding a local jar file as a library to a module:Create a \'libs\' folder in the top level of the module directory (the same directory that contains the \'src\' directory)In the build.gradle file add the following so that your dependencies closure has:Android Studio should have already setup a gradlew wrapper. From the command line, navigate to the top level of your project (the directory that has a gradlew file).Run ./gradlew assemble. This should compile the project with the library. You may need to fix errors in your build.gradle file as necessary.In order to have Android Studio recognize the local jar files as libraries for support while coding in the IDE, you need to take a few more steps:4.1. Right click on the module in the left hand panel and choose Open Library Settings.4.2.  On the left panel of the dialog, choose Libraries.4.3. Click the + sign above the panel second from the left -> Java4.4. Select your local jar and add it to the project.You may need to run the above ./gradlew command one more timeIn the project right click 1:2:3:You will see this:In Android Stuido, I like use Gradle to manage Gson lib.Add below dependency in your build.gradle file.Everything is OK.You can also see this post.\nThe best way to integrate third party library in Android studioIIRC, simply using "Add as library" isn\'t enough for it to compile with the project.Check Intellij\'s help about adding libraries to a projectThe part that should interest you the most is this:(In File > Project Structure) Open the module settings and select the Dependencies tab.On the Dependencies tab, click add and select Library.In the Choose Libraries dialog, select one or more libraries and click Add Selected.If the library doesn\'t show up in the dialog, add it in the Libraries settings, right below Modules.You shouldn\'t need to add compile files() anymore, and the library should be properly added to your project.All these solutions are outdated. It\'s really easy now in Android Studio:File > New Module...The next screen looks weird, like you are selecting some widget or something but keep it\non the first picture and below scroll and find "Import JAR or .AAR Package"Then take Project Structure from File menu.Select app from the opened window then select dependencies ,then press green plus button ,select module dependency then select module you imported then press OK\'compile files...\' used to work for me, but not any more. after much pain, I found that using this instead works:compile fileTree(dir: \'libs\', include: \'*.jar\')I have no idea why that made a difference, but, at least the damn thing is working now.Easy steps to add external library in Android StudioPlease Note : If you are using 3rd party libraries then it is better to use dependencies where Gradle script\n  automatically downloads the JAR and the dependency JAR when gradle\n  script run.Ex : compile \'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:9.4.0\'Read more about Gradle Dependency MangementThat solved my problem. Try, if anyone want more details let me know.I made it work by just adding one line to build.gradle:Do not forget to click "Sync now" in the top right corner.I\xc2\xb4m using Android Studio 1.0.1.1. Put the jar (in my case, gson-2.2.4.jar) into the libs folder.2. Ensure that compile files (libs/gson-2.2.4.jar) is in your build.gradle file.3. Now Click on the "Sync Project with Gradle files"(Left to AVD manager Button on the topbar).After I did the above three, it started working fine.I found Dependency Manager of Android Studio quite handy and powerful for managing 3rd party dependencies (like gson mentioned here). Providing step by step guide which worked for me (NOTE: These steps are tested for Android Studio 1.6 and onward versions on Windows platform).Step-1:\nGoto "Build > Edit Libraries and Dependencies..." it would open up the dialog "Project Structure"Step-2:\nSelect "app" and then select "Dependencies" tab. Then select "Add > 1 Library dependency"Step-3:\n"Choose Library Dependency" dialog would be shown, specify "gson" in search and press the "search button"Step-4:\nThe desired dependency would be shown in search list, select com.google.code.gson:gson:2.7 (this is the latest version at the time when I wrote the answer), press OKPress OK on "Project Structure" dialog. Gradle would update your build scripts accordingly.Hope this would help :)Download & Copy Your .jar file in libs folder then adding these line to build.gradle:Do not forget to click "Sync now"Android Studio 1.1.0Unlike Eclipse we don\'t need to download jar and put it in /libs folder. Gradle handles these things we only need to add Gradle dependencies, Gradle downloads it and puts in gradle cache.We need to add dependencies as:dependencies {compile \'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.2.4\'}thats it\nHowever we can also download jar & add that as library but the best practice is to add Gradle dependencies.You can do this with two options.first simple way.Copy the .jar file to clipboard then add it to libs folder. To see libs folder in the project, choose the project from combobox above the folders.then right click on the .jar file and click add as a library then choose a module then ok. \nYou can see the .jar file in build.gradle file within dependencies block.Second way is that: We can add a .jar file to a module by importing this .jar file as a .jar module then add this module to any module we want.import module ---> choose your .jar file --> than import as a .jar --\nThen CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+S --> project sturure -->choose the module you want ato add a jar -->Dependencendies --> Module Dependency. build.gradle of the module will updated automatically. \nJust put the .jar files in libs folder of the Android project.compile fileTree(dir: \'libs\', include: [\'*.jar\'])this line of code in the apps graddle file will do the rest.Happy Coding :)Ive done above 3 steps and its work charm for me.(I am using Android Studio 2.1.2)Step 1Step 2:\nRight click on app folder -> New -> ModuleStep 3: Click Import JAR/.AAR Package Then browse your package. as an example: OkHttp.jarCreate a folder libs. Add your .jar file. Right click on it and you will find add jar as dependency. Click on it. Its all you need to do.\nYou can find the dependencies added to your build.gradle file.1) create an \'your_libs\' folder inside the Project/app/src folder.2) Copy your jar file into this \'your_libs\' folder3) In Android Studio, go to File -> Project Structure -> Dependencies -> Add -> File Dependency and navigate to your jar file, which should be under \'src/your_libs\'3) Select your jar file and click \'Ok\'and then you can see on your build.gradle like this :  compile \nfiles(\'src/your_libs/your.jar\')In android Studio 1.1.0 .\nI solved this question by following steps:1: Put jar file into libs directory. (in Finder)2: Open module settings , go to Dependencies ,at left-bottom corner there is a plus button. Click plus button then choose "File Dependency" .Here you can see you jar file. Select it and it\'s resolved.Step 1 : Now under your app folder you should see libs, if you don\'t see it, then create it .Step 2 : Drag & Drop the .jar file here, you may be get a prompt "This file does not belong to the project", just click OK Button .Step 3 : Now you should see the jar file under libs folder, right click on the jar file and select "Add as library", Click OK for prompt "Create Library"Step 4 : Now this jar has been added.On Mac OS X: Add jar as library (drag jar to libs, right click add as lib) Add compile statement to build.gradeInstall gradle v1.6 (use homebrew)gradle clean (rebuild android did not work) This sorted me out. Like many before pointed out you shall add to your build.gradle file. However I have a project in Android Studio that was migrated from Eclipse and in this case the "libs" folder is named "lib" so for me removing the "s" solved the problem. compile fileTree(dir: \'libs\', include: \'*.jar\') works fine but not compile files(...) have tested with Studio Beta 0.8.1My answer is basically gathering some of the right but incomplete answers provided above.Add the following:This will allow support for two different ways of adding dependencies. The compile fileTree(dir: \'libs\', include: [\'*.jar\']) (as @Binod mentioned) tells the compiler to look under the folder libs for ANY jar. It is a good practice to create such a folder \'libs\' which will contain the jar packages that our application needs to use.But this will also allow support for Maven dependency. The compile \'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.3\' (as mentioned by @saneryee) it is another recommended way to add dependencies that are in a central remote repository and not in our /libs "local repository". It is basically telling gradle to look for that version of that package and it\'s telling the compiler to consider it when compiling the project (having it in the classpath)PS: I use bothFor newer Android 1.0.2 the following is already there in your build.gradle filecompile fileTree(include: [\'*.jar\'], dir: \'libs\')Add the library jar to your libs folder -> right click the library -> click add as a library -> it asks you for the project to add it for -> select your project-> click ok\nThe following line is automatically added to build.gradlecompile files(\'libs/android-query.jar\')That did it for me. nothing more was required. i have shown this for android aquery another third party library for android.I observed "CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+S --> project structure --> app-module -->Dependencies" already had an entry as "(dir: \'libs\', include: \'*.jar\')" under "compile-option", initially. And after adding the jar\'s as per the steps stated above, the "build.gradle" got the entries for the new added jar\'s, itself.In Android Studio 2.1 I follow the this way,Goto app -> src-> main -> assets folder (If not available create it) -> put your JAR filesIn your build.gradle add dependency like this,Sync now. \nNow your JAR files ready to use.I have read all the answers here and they all seem to cover old versions of Android Studio!With a project created with Android Studio 2.2.3 I just needed to create a libs directory under app and place my jar there.\nI did that with my file manager, no need to click or edit anything in Android Studio.Why it works? Open Build / Edit Libraries and Dependencies and you will see:
