I want to package my project in a single executable JAR for distribution.How can I make Maven package all dependency JARs into my JAR?and you run it withCompile goal should be added before assembly:single or otherwise the code on your own project is not included.See more details in comments.Commonly this goal is tied to a build phase to execute automatically. This ensures the JAR is built when executing mvn install or performing a deployment/release.You can use the dependency-plugin to generate all dependencies in a separate directory before the package phase and then include that in the classpath of the manifest:Alternatively use ${project.build.directory}/classes/lib as OutputDirectory to integrate all jar-files into the main jar, but then you will need to add custom classloading code to load the jars.Taking Unanswered\'s answer and reformatting it, we have:Next, I would recommend making this a natural part of your build, rather than something to call explicitly.  To make this a integral part of your build, add this plugin to your pom.xml and bind it to the package lifecycle event.  However, a gotcha is that you need to call the assembly:single goal if putting this in your pom.xml, while you would call \'assembly:assembly\' if executing it manually from the command line.I blogged about some different ways to do this.See Executable Jar with Apache Maven (WordPress)or executable-jar-with-maven-example (GitHub)Those pros and cons are provided by Stephan.At this point the jar is actually executable with external classpath elements.The jar file is only executable with the sibling ...lib/ directory. We need to make archives to deploy with the directory and its content.\nNow you have target/${project.build.finalName}.(zip|tar|tar.bz2|tar.gz) which each contains the jar and lib/*.You have target/${project.bulid.finalName}-jar-with-dependencies.jar.You have target/${project.build.finalName}-shaded.jar.You have target/${project.bulid.finalName}-spring-boot.jar.Use the maven-shade-plugin to package all dependencies into one uber-jar. It can also be used to build an executable jar by specifying the main class. After trying to use maven-assembly and maven-jar , I found that this plugin best suited my needs. I found this plugin particularly useful as it merges content of specific files instead of overwriting them. This is needed when there are resource files that are have the same name across the jars and the plugin tries to package all the resource filesSee example below You can use maven-dependency-plugin, but the question was how to create an executable JAR. To do that requires the following alteration to Matthew Franglen\'s response (btw, using the dependency plugin takes longer to build when starting from a clean target):Long used the maven assembly plugin, but I could not find a solution to the problem with "already added, skipping". Now, I\'m using another plugin - onejar-maven-plugin. Example below (mvn package build jar):You need to add repository for that plugin:Another option if you really want to repackage the other JARs contents inside your single resultant JAR is the Maven Assembly plugin.  It unpacks and then repacks everything into a directory via <unpack>true</unpack>. Then you\'d have a second pass that built it into one massive JAR.Another option is the OneJar plugin.  This performs the above repackaging actions all in one step.You can add the following to your pom.xml:Afterwards you have to switch via the console to the directory, where the pom.xml is located. Then you have to execute mvn assembly:single and then your executable JAR file with dependencies will be hopefully build. You can check it when switching to the output (target) directory with cd ./target and starting your jar with a command similiar to java -jar mavenproject1-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar. I tested this with Apache Maven 3.0.3.You could combine the maven-shade-plugin and maven-jar-plugin.Example POM configuration for maven-jar-plugin:Finally create the executable jar by invoking:Here\'s an executable jar plugin for Maven that we use at Credit Karma. It creates a jar of jars with a classloader capable of loading classes from nested jars.  This allows you to have the same classpath in dev and prod and still keep all classes in a single signed jar file.https://github.com/creditkarma/maven-exec-jar-pluginAnd here\'s a blog post with details about the plugin and why we made it: \nhttps://engineering.creditkarma.com/general-engineering/new-executable-jar-plugin-available-apache-maven/Ken Liu has it right in my opinion. The maven dependency plugin allows you to expand all the dependencies, which you can then treat as resources. This allows you to include them in the main artifact. The use of the assembly plugin creates a secondary artifact which can be difficult to modify - in my case I wanted to add custom manifest entries. My pom ended up as:I went through every one of these responses looking to make a fat executable jar containing all dependencies and none of them worked right.  The answer is the shade plugin, its very easy and straightforward.Be aware that your dependencies need to have a scope of compile or runtime for this to work properly.This example came from mkyong.comit should be like thatunpacking have to be in generate-resources phase because, if in package phase, will not be included as resources.\nTry clean package and you\'ll seeUse onejar plugin to build it as one executable jar file which packages all the dependancy jars in it. That solved my problem which was similar to this. When assembly plugin was used, it unpacked all the dependancy jars into source folder and repackage them as a jar, it had over written all the similar implementations I had inside my code which were having the same class names. onejar is an easy solution in here.Problem with locating shared assembly file with maven-assembly-plugin-2.2.1?Try using descriptorId configuration parameter instead of descriptors/descriptor or descriptorRefs/descriptorRef parameters.Neither of them do what you need: look for the file on classpath.\nOf course you need adding the package where the shared assembly resides on maven-assembly-plugin\'s classpath (see below).\nIf you\'re using Maven 2.x (not Maven 3.x), you may need adding this dependency in top-most parent pom.xml in pluginManagement section.See this for more details.Class: org.apache.maven.plugin.assembly.io.DefaultAssemblyReaderExample:I won\'t answer directly the question as other have already done that before, but I really wonder if it\'s a good idea to embed all the dependencies in the project\'s jar itself.I see the point (ease of deployment / usage) but it depends of the use case of your poject (and there may be alternatives (see below)).If you use it fully standalone, why not.But if you use your project in other contexts (like in a webapp, or dropped in a folder where other jars are sitting), you may have jar duplicates in your classpath (the ones in the folder, the one in the jars). Maybe not a bid deal but i usually avoid this.A good alternative :Like this, with in the end just a manifest and a "special dynamic classloader main", you can start your project with :If you want if from command Line itself . Just run the below command from the project path mvn assembly:assemblyYou can also use this plug-in, it is pretty good and I use it for packaging my jars http://sonatype.github.io/jarjar-maven-plugin/Something that have worked for me was:I had extraordinary case because my dependency was system one:I have changed the code provided by @user189057 with changes:\n1) maven-dependency-plugin is executed in "prepare-package" phase\n2) I am extracting unpacked classess directly to "target/classes"This is the best way i found:With this configuration, all dependencies will be located in /dependency-jars. My application has no Main class, just context ones, but one of my dependencies do have a Main class (com.myDomain.etc.MainClassName) that starts the JMX server, and receives a start or a stop parameter. So with this i was able to start my application like this:I wait it be useful for you all.The maven-assembly-plugin worked great for me.\nI spent hours with the maven-dependency-plugin and couldn\'t make it work. The main reason was that I had to define in the configuration section explicitly the artifact items which should be included as it is described in the documentation. \nThere is an example there for the cases when you want to use it like: mvn dependency:copy, where there are not included any artifactItems but it doesn\'t work.I tried the most up-voted answer here, and was able to get the jar runnable. But the program didn\'t run correctly. I do not know what the reason was. When I try to run from Eclipse, I get a different result but when I run the jar from command-line I get a different result (it crashes with a program-specific runtime error).I had a similar requirement as the OP just that I had too many (Maven) dependencies for my project. Fortunately, the only solution that worked for me was that using Eclipse. Very simple and very straightforward. This is not a solution to the OP but is a solution for someone who has a similar requirement but with many Maven dependencies,1) Just right-click on your project folder (in Eclipse) and select Export2) Then select Java -> Runnable Jar3) You will be asked to choose the location of the jar file4) Finally, select the class that has the Main method that you want to run and choose Package dependencies with the Jar file and click FinishThis could also be an option,You will be able to build your jar fileI compared the tree plugins mentioned in this post. I generated 2 jars and a directory with all the jars. I compared the results and definitely the maven-shade-plugin is the best. My challenge was that I have multiple spring resources that needed to be merged, as well as jax-rs, and JDBC services. They were all merged properly by the shade plugin in comparison with the maven-assembly-plugin. In which case the spring will fail unless you copy them to your own resources folder and merge them manually one time. Both plugins output the correct dependency tree. I had multiple scopes like test,provide, compile, etc the test and provided were skipped by both plugins. They both produced the same manifest but I was able to consolidate licenses with the shade plugin using their transformer.\nWith the maven-dependency-plugin of course you don\'t have those problems because the jars are not extracted. But like some other have pointed you need to carry one extra file(s) to work properly.\nHere is a snip of the pom.xmlTo resolve this issue we will use Maven Assembly Plugin that will create the JAR together with its dependency JARs into a single executable JAR file. Just add below plugin configuration in your pom.xml file.After doing this don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to run MAVEN tool with this command mvn clean compile assembly:singlehttp://jkoder.com/maven-creating-a-jar-together-with-its-dependency-jars-into-a-single-executable-jar-file/Add to pom.xml:andThats it. Next mvn package will also create one fat jar additionally, including all dependency jars.This blog post shows another approach with combining the maven-jar and maven-assembly plugins. With the assembly configuration xml from the blog post it can also be controlled if dependencies will be expanded or just be collected in a folder and referenced by a classpath entry in the manifest:The ideal solution is to include the jars in a lib folder and the manifest.mf file of the main jar include all the jars in classpath.And exactly that one is described here: https://caffebig.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/executable-jar-file-with-dependent-jars-using-maven/Okay, so this is my solution. I know it\'s not using the pom.xml file. But I had the problem my programmme compiling and running on Netbeans but it failing when I tried Java -jar MyJarFile.jar. Now, I don\'t fully understand Maven and I think this why was having trouble getting Netbeans 8.0.2 to include my jar file in a library to put them into a jar file. I was thinking about how I used to use jar files with no Maven in Eclipse. It\'s Maven that can compile all the dependanices and plugins. Not Netbeans. (If you can get Netbeans and be able to use java .jar to do this please tell me how (^.^)v )[Solved - for Linux] by opening a terminal. ThenNextNextThis will create jar file in the target directory.Now(You may need to run: chmod +x MyJarFile-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar)And finallyPlease see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/LifecyclePhaseNotFoundExceptionI\'ll post this solution in on a couple of other pages with a similar problem. Hopefully I can save somebody from a week of frustration.Please check this answer with pictorial demo https://stackoverflow.com/a/35359756/5678086 for creating full pack with all dependencies
