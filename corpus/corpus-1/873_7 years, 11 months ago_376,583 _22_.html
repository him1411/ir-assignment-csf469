I make changes to several files, open Git and add these files to my staging area with "git add ."Question: How do I remove one of those files from the staging area but not remove it from the index or undo the changes to the file itself?If I understand the question correctly, you simply want to "undo" the git add that was done for that file.If that is the case, then git reset HEAD -- <file> will do the job.\nIf you need to remove a whole directory (folder) from the staging area use git reset HEAD -- <directoryName>Your modifications will be kept.
