What is the difference between proxy server and reverse proxy server? The previous answers were accurate, but perhaps too terse.\nI will try to add some examples.First of all, the word "proxy" describes someone or something acting on behalf of someone else.In the computer realm, we are talking about one server acting on the behalf of another computer.For the purposes of accessibility, I will limit my discussion to web proxies - however, the idea of a proxy is not limited to web sites.Most discussion of web proxies refers to the type of proxy known as a "forward proxy."The proxy event in this case is that the "forward proxy" retrieves data from another web site on behalf of the original requestee.For an example, I will list three computers connected to the internet.Normally, one would connect directly from X --> Z.However, in some scenarios, it is better for Y --> Z on behalf of X,\nwhich chains as follows: X --> Y --> Z.Here is a (very) partial list of uses of a forward proxy server.1) X is unable to access Z directly\nbecausea) Someone with administration authority over X\'s internet connection has decided to block all access to site Z. Examples:The Storm Worm virus is spreading by tricking people into visiting familypostcards2008.com, so the system administrator has blocked access to the site to prevent users from inadvertently infecting themselves.Employees at a large company have been wasting too much time on facebook.com, so management wants access blocked during business hours.A local elementary school disallows internet access to the playboy.com web site.A government is unable to control the publishing of news, so it controls access to news instead, by blocking sites such as wikipedia.org. See TOR or FreeNet.b) The administrator of Z has blocked X.Examples:The administrator of Z has noticed hacking attempts coming from X, so the administrator has decided to block X\'s ip address (and/or netrange).Z is a forum web site.  X is spamming the forum. Z blocks X.For this example, I will list three computers connected to the internet.Normally, one would connect directly from X --> Z.However, in some scenarios, it is better for the administrator of Z to restrict or disallow direct access, and force visitors to go through Y first.\nSo, as before, we have data being retrieved by Y --> Z on behalf of X, which chains as follows: X --> Y --> Z.What is different this time compared to a "forward proxy," is that this time the user X does not know he is accessing Z, because the user X only sees he is communicating with Y.\nThe server Z is invisible to clients and only the reverse proxy Y is visible externally. A reverse proxy requires no (proxy) configuration on the client side. The client X thinks he is only communicating with Y (X --> Y), but the reality is that Y forwarding all communication (X --> Y --> Z again).In the above scenarios, Z has the ability to choose Y.A pair of simple definition would  beForward Proxy: Acting on behalf of a requestor (or service consumer)Reverse Proxy: Acting on behalf of  service/content producer.qyb2zm302\'s answer nicely details applications of proxies but slips up on the fundamental concept between forward and reverse proxies. For the reverse proxy, X -> Y -> Z, X knows about Y and not Z, rather than vice versa.http://www.jscape.com/blog/bid/87783/Forward-Proxy-vs-Reverse-Proxy explains the difference between forward and reverse proxies very clearly. A proxy is simply a middleman for communication(requests+responses). Client <-> Proxy <-> ServerClient proxy: ( Client <-> Proxy ) <-> ServerThe proxy acts on behalf of the client. Client knows about all 3\nmachines involved in chain. Server doesn\'t. Server proxy: Client <-> ( Proxy <-> Server )The proxy acts on behalf of the server. Client only knows about proxy. Server knows whole chain.Seems to me that forward and reverse are simply confusing, perspective-dependent names for client and server proxy. I suggest abandoning the former for the latter, for explicit communication.Of course, to further complicate the matter, not every machine is exclusively a  client or a server. If there is an ambiguity in context, it\'s best to explicitly specify where the proxy lies, and the communications that it tunnels.Some diagrams might help:Forward proxyReverse proxyI found this diagram to be very helpful. It just shows the Architecture of a Forward vs Reverse proxy setup with a complete perspective i.e from My Computer to Internet. This image will help you to understand qyb2zm302\'s post better.It reminds you of the classic proverb:A picture is worth 1000 words.Source: https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-a-reverse-proxy-and-forward-proxy. All credits to the person who created this diagram.The difference is primarily in deployment. Web forward and reverse proxies all have the same underlying features, they accept requests for HTTP requests in various formats and provide a response, usually by accessing the origin or contact server. Fully featured servers usually have access control, caching, and some link-mapping features.A forward proxy is a proxy that is accessed by configuring the client machine. The client needs protocol support for proxy features (redirection, proxy auth, etc.). The proxy is transparent to the user experience, but not to the application.A reverse proxy is a proxy that is deployed as a web server and behaves like a web server, with the exception that instead of locally composing the content from programs and disk, it forwards the request to an origin server. From the client perspective it IS a web server, so the user experience is completely transparent. In fact, a single proxy instance can run as a forward and reverse proxy at the same time for different client populations.That\'s the short version, I can clarify if people want to comment.A proxy server proxies (and optionally caches) outgoing network requests to various not-necessarily-related public resources across the Internet. A reverse proxy captures (and optionally caches) incoming requests from the Internet and distributes them to various internal private resources, usually for HA purposes.Proxy : It is making the request on behalf of the client. So, the server will return the response to the proxy and the proxy will forward the response to the client. In fact, the server will never "learn" who the client was (client\'s IP), it will only know the proxy. However, the client definitely knows the server, since it essentially formats the HTTP request destined for the server, but it just hands it to the proxy.Reverse Proxy : It is receiving the request on behalf of the server. It forwards the request to the server, receives the response and then returns the response to the client. In this case, the client will never "learn" who was the actual server (server\'s IP) (with some exceptions), it will only know the proxy. The server will or won\'t know the actual client, depending on the configurations of the reverse proxy.Best explanation here with diagrams:While a forward proxy proxies in behalf of clients ( or requesting hosts ), a reverse proxy proxies in behalf of serversIn effect, whereas a forward proxy hides the identities of clients, a reverse proxy hides the identities of serversAn ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client and the origin server. In order to get content from the origin server, the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server as the target and the proxy then requests the content from the origin server and returns it to the client. The client must be specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other sites.A reverse proxy (or gateway), by contrast, appears to the client just like an ordinary web server. No special configuration on the client is necessary. The client makes ordinary requests for content in the name-space of the reverse proxy. The reverse proxy then decides where to send those requests, and returns the content as if it was itself the origin.A typical usage of a reverse proxy is to provide Internet users access to a server that is behind a firewall. Reverse proxies can also be used to balance load among several back-end servers, or to provide caching for a slower back-end server. In addition, reverse proxies can be used simply to bring several servers into the same URL space.for more info visit : Apache DocsThis is a great read to understand the differences between a Forward and Reverse PROXY\nhttp://www.jscape.com/blog/bid/87783/Forward-Proxy-vs-Reverse-ProxyA forward proxy hides the identities of clients(users) whereas a reverse proxy hides the identities of your servers.As per my understanding..........To start with, as everyone knows proxy means "The authority to represent someone else".\nNow there are two things Forward and Reverse proxy. FORWARD PROXY\nSuppose you want to access "google" and "google" in turn will have n number of servers to respond to that particular request.Now in this case while you are requesting for something from google and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want google to see your IP address then you will use a forward proxy, as explained below.A----->B----->CNow here you are A sending a request through B, So C will think that the request is coming from B, not A. In this way you can prevent your clients IP not to be exposed to outer world.REVERSE PROXY.\nNow in this case, to make you understand we will take the same case of forward proxy. Here you have requested for something to google which in turn going to send the one request to the app server or another proxy server to get the response. So these things will happen as explained below.A----->B----->CA<-----B<-----C\nFrom the above diagram you can see that a request has been sent to C from B not from A.Then from C there will be one Request send to D. Similarly the response will go to C from D and then to B and A.The above diagram says its only the context which matters although both the proxies are acting the same way but client side proxy is hiding client information whereas server side proxy will hide server side information.Please comment if you feel the above explanation is wrong.Heres an example of a reverse proxy (as a load balancer).A client surfs to website.com and the server it hits has a reverse proxy running on it. The reverse proxy happens to be pound. Pound takes the request and sends it to one of the three application servers sitting behind it. In this example Pound is a load balancer. ie. it is balancing load between three application servers.\nThe application servers serve up the website content back to the client.Although my understanding from an apache perspective is that Proxy means that if site x proxies for site y, then requests for x return y.The reverse proxy means that the response from y is adjusted so that all references to y become x.So that the user cannot tell that a proxy is involved...Forward proxies grant the client anonymity (i.e, think Tor).Reverse proxies grant back end servers anonymity (i.e, think servers behind a DMZ).
