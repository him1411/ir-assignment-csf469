I want to pause input in a shell script, and prompt the user for choices. The standard \'Yes, No, or Cancel\' type question. How do I accomplish this in a typical bash prompt?The simplest and most widely available method to get user input at a shell prompt is the read command. The best way to illustrate its use is a simple demonstration:Another method, pointed out by Steven Huwig, is Bash\'s select command. Here is the same example using select:With select you don\'t need to sanitize the input â€“ it displays the available choices, and you type a number corresponding to your choice. It also loops automatically, so there\'s no need for a while true loop to retry if they give invalid input.Also, please check out the excellent answer by F. Hauri.Depending onand if you wantYou could use the read command, followed by if ... then ... else:But if you don\'t want the user to have to hit Return, you could write:(Edited: As @JonathanLeffler rightly suggest, saving stty\'s configuration could be better than simply force them to sane.)Note: This was tested under sh, bash, ksh, dash and busybox!Same, but waiting explicitly for y or n:There are many tools which were built using libncurses, libgtk, libqt\' or other graphical libraries. For example, usingwhiptail`:Depending on your system, you may need to replace whiptail with another siliar tool:where 20 is height of dialog box in number of lines and 60 is width of  the dialog box. These tools all have similar syntax.I prefer to use case so I could even test for yes | ja | si | oui if needed...Under bash, we can specify the length of intended input for for the read command:Under bash, read command accepts a timeout parameter, which could be useful.More sophisticated dialog boxes, beyond simple yes - no purposes:Progress bar:Little demo:Example:This will create a file .myscript.history in your $HOME directory, than you could use readline\'s history commands, like Up,  Down, Ctrl+r and others.You can use the built-in read command. Use the -p option to prompt the user with a question.Since BASH4, you can now use -i to suggest an answer, so the user only have to press return to enter it :(But remember to use the "readline" option -e to allow line editing with arrow keys)Bash has select for this purpose.Here\'s something I put together:I\'m a beginner, so take this with a grain of salt, but it seems to work.The easiest way to achieve this with the least number of lines is as follows:The if is just an example: it is up to you how to handle this variable.Use the read command:and then all of the other stuff you needThis solution reads a single character and calls a function on a yes response.The -e option enables the user to edit the input using arrow keys.If you want to use a suggestion as input:-i option prints a suggestive input.Sorry for posting on such an old post. Some weeks ago I was facing a similar problem, in my case I needed a solution which also worked within an online installer-script, eg: curl -Ss https://raw.github.com/_____/installer.sh | bash Using read yesno < /dev/tty works fine for me: Hope this helps someone.To get a nice ncurses-like inputbox use the command dialog like this:The dialog package is installed by default at least with SUSE Linux.Multiple choice version:Example:It will set REPLY to y (inside the script).Inspired by the answers of @Mark and @Myrddin I created this function for a universal promptuse it like this:One simple way to do this is with xargs -p or gnu parallel --interactive.I like the behavior of xargs a little better for this because it executes each command immediately after the prompt like other interactive unix commands, rather than collecting the yesses to run at the end.  (You can Ctrl-C after you get through the ones you wanted.)e.g., more generic would be:I suggest you use dialog... The dialog command enables the use of window boxes in shell scripts to make their use more interactive.it\'s simple and easy to use, there\'s also a gnome version called gdialog that takes the exact same parameters, but shows it GUI style on X.As a friend of a one line command I used the following:Written longform, it works like this:I noticed that no one posted an answer showing multi-line echo menu for such simple user input so here is my go at it:This method was posted in the hopes that someone may find it useful and time-saving.I\'ve used the case statement a couple of times in such a scenario, using the case statment is a good way to go about it. A while loop, that ecapsulates the case block, that utilizes a boolean condition can be implemented in order to hold even more control of the program, and fulfill many other requirements. After the all the conditions have been met, a break can be used which will pass control back to the main part of the program. Also, to meet other conditions, of course conditional statements can be added to accompany the control structures: case statement and possible while loop.Example of using a case statement to fulfill your requestFunction:Usage:With php, this is powerful for shell scripts:The php-cli package only is mandatory for this.
