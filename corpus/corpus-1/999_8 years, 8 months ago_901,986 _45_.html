This question already has an answer here:I use the following for a jQuery link in my <script> tags:Is there a link to the "latest" version? Something like the following (which doesn\'t work):(Obviously not necessarily a great plan to link your code to potentially changing libraries but useful in development.)Up until jQuery 1.11.1, you could use the following URLs to get the latest version of jQuery:For example:However, since jQuery 1.11.1, both jQuery and Google stopped updating these URL\'s; they will forever be fixed at 1.11.1. There is no supported alternative URL to use. For an explanation of why this is the case, see this blog post; Don\'t use jquery-latest.js.Both hosts support https as well as http, so change the protocol as you see fit (or use a protocol relative URI)See also: https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguideDO NOT USE THIS ANSWER. The URL is pointing at jQuery 1.11 (and always will).Credits to Basic for above snippethttp://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js is the minified version, always up-to-date.Be aware that caching headers are different when you use "direct" vs. "latest" link from google.When using http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.1/jquery.min.jsWhen using http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.jsDon\xe2\x80\x99t Use jquery-latest.jsThis file is no longer updated (it\'ll be on v1.11.1 forever). Furthermore it has a very short cache life, (wiping out the benefits of using a CDN) so you\'d be better of selecting a version of jQuery instead.More details on the jQuery blog:\nhttp://blog.jquery.com/2014/07/03/dont-use-jquery-latest-js/Not for nothing, but you shouldn\'t just automatically use the latest library. If they release the newest library tomorrow and it breaks some of your scripts, you are SOL, but if you use the library you used to develop the scripts, you will ensure they will work.Use:Note: The above snippet will stick to 1.7.1 or 1.11.1.My advice for production is to hard code the CDN jQuery version: <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></script>You can find the latest Libraries of Google CDN here:\nhttps://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/Or use the jQuery CDN:\nhttps://code.jquery.com/jQuery also doesn\'t allow you to call their latest file over SSL, a consideration if you want to use jQuery in a shopping cart etc.e.g.will give you a security error.Google\'s API will let you call over SSL:No.  There isn\'t..But, for development there is such a link on the jQuery code site.Yes there is.http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.jsWhat about this one?http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.jsI think this is always the latest version - Correct me, if I\'m wrong.http://lab.abhinayrathore.com/jquery_cdn/ is a page where you can find links to the latest versions of jQuery, jQuery UI and Themes for Google and Microsoft CDN\'s.This page automatically updates with the latest links from the CDN.You can use the latest version of the jQuery library by any of the following.Google Ajax API CDN (also supports SSL via HTTPS)/jquery.min.js\n    Microsoft CDN (also aupports SSL via HTTPS)Ajax CDN Announcement, Microsoft Ajax CDN DocumentationjQuery CDN (via Media Temple)** Minified version** Development (Full) version
