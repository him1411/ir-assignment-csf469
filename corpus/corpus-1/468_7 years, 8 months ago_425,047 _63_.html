How can I view any local commits I\'ve made, that haven\'t yet been pushed to the remote repository? Occasionally, git status will print out that my branch is X commits ahead of origin/master, but not always.Is this a bug with my install of Git, or am I missing something?You can also view the diff using the same syntaxIf you want to see all commits on all branches that aren\'t pushed yet, you might be looking for something like this:And if you only want to see the most recent commit on each branch, and the branch names, this:You can show all commits that you have locally but not upstream with@{u} or @{upstream} means the upstream branch of the current branch (see git rev-parse --help or git help revisions for details).This worked for me:As indicated at Git: See all unpushed commits or commits that are not in another branch.You can do this with git log:Assuming that origin is the name of your upstream, leaving off any revision name after .. implies HEAD, which lists the new commits that haven\'t been pushed.Handy git alias for looking for unpushed commits in current branch:What this basically does:but also determines current branch name.You could try.... I know it is not a pure command line option but if you have it installed and are on a GUI system it\'s a great way to see exactly what you are looking for plus a whole lot more.(I\'m actually kind of surprised no one mentioned it so far.)All the other answers talk about "upstream" (the branch you pull from).\nBut a local branch can push to a different branch than the one it pulls from.master might not push to the remote tracking branch "origin/master".\nThe upstream branch for master might be origin/master, but it could push to the remote tracking branch origin/xxx or even anotherUpstreamRepo/yyy.\nThose are set by branch.*.pushremote for the current branch along with the global remote.pushDefault value.It is that remote-tracking branch which counts when seeking unpushed commits: the one that tracks the branch at the remote where the local branch would be pushed to.\nThe branch at the remote can be, again, origin/xxx or even anotherUpstreamRepo/yyy.  See commit 29bc885, commit 3dbe9db, commit adfe5d0, commit 48c5847, commit a1ad0eb, commit e291c75, commit 979cb24, commit 1ca41a1, commit 3a429d0, commit a9f9f8c, commit 8770e6f, commit da66b27, commit f052154, commit 9e3751d, commit ee2499f [all from 21 May 2015], and commit e41bf35 [01 May 2015] by Jeff King (peff).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit c4a8354, 05 Jun 2015) Commit adfe5d0  explains:In a triangular workflow, each branch may have two distinct points of interest: the @{upstream} that you normally pull from, and the destination that you normally push to. There isn\'t a shorthand for the latter, but it\'s useful to have.For instance, you may want to know which commits you haven\'t\n  pushed yet:Or as a more complicated example, imagine that you normally pull changes from origin/master (which you set as your @{upstream}), and push changes to your own personal fork (e.g., as myfork/topic).\n  You may push to your fork from multiple machines, requiring you to integrate the changes from the push destination, rather than upstream.\n  With this patch, you can just do:rather than typing out the full name.Commit 29bc885 adds:Just as we have "%(upstream)" to report the "@{upstream}" for each ref, this patch adds "%(push)" to match "@{push}".\n  It supports the same tracking format modifiers as upstream (because you may want to know, for example, which branches have commits to push). If you want to see how many commit your local branches are ahead/behind compared to the branch you are pushing to:I use the following alias to get just the list of files (and the status) that have been committed but haven\'t been pushed (for the current branch)then just do:git branch -v will show, for each local branch, whether it\'s "ahead" or not.I believe the most typical way of doing this is to run something like:However, I personally prefer running:which shows the commits from all branches which are not merged upstream, plus the last commit in upstream (which shows up as a root node for all the other commits). I use it so often that I have created alias noup for it.I suggest you go see the script https://github.com/badele/gitcheck, i have coded this script for check in one pass all your git repositories, and it show who has not commited and who has not pushed/pulled.Here a sample result It is not a bug. What you probably seeing is git status after a failed auto-merge where the changes from the remote are fetched but not yet merged.To see the commits between local repo and remote do this:This is 100% safe and will not mock up your working copy. If there were changes git status wil show X commits ahead of origin/master.You can now show log of commits that are in the remote but not in the local:There is tool named unpushed that scans all Git, Mercurial and Subversion repos in specified working directory and shows list of ucommited files and unpushed commits.\nInstallation is simple under Linux:orto install system-wide.Usage is simple too:See unpushed --help or official description for more information. It also has a cronjob script unpushed-notify for on-screen notification of uncommited and unpushed changes.This will list out your local comment history (not yet pushed) with corresponding messageThis worked better for me:or:If the number of commits that have not been pushed out is a single-digit number, which it often is, the easiest way is:git responds by telling you that you are "ahead N commits" relative your origin.  So now just keep that number in mind when viewing logs. If you\'re "ahead by 3 commits", the top 3 commits in the history are still private.Similar: To view unmerged branches:Those can be suspect but I recommend the answer by cxregTo list all unpushed commit in all branches easily you can use this command:one way of doing things is to list commits that are available on one branch but not another.I had a commit done previously, not pushed to any branch, nor remote nor local. Just the commit. Nothing from other answers worked for me, but with:\ngit reflog \nThere I found my commit.Here\'s my portable solution (shell script which works on Windows too without additional install) which shows the differences from origin for all branches: git-fetch-logAn example output:Parameters passed for log, e.g. --oneline or --patch can be used.will show all the diffs in your local commits.will show the local commit id and the name of commit.Assuming your branch is set up to track the origin, then that should show you the differences.Will give you a summary of the commits.
