This question already has an answer here:I want to parse a JSON string in JavaScript. The response is something likeHow can I get the values result and count from this?Most browsers support JSON.parse(), which is defined in ECMA-262 5th Edition (the specification that JavaScript is based on). Its usage is simple:For the browsers that don\'t you can implement it using json2.js.As noted in the comments, if you\'re already using jQuery, there is a $.parseJSON function that maps to JSON.parse if available or a form of eval in older browsers.\xe2\x80\x82However, this performs additional, unnecessary checks that are also performed by JSON.parse, so for the best all round performance I\'d recommend using it like so:This will ensure you use native JSON.parse immediately, rather than having jQuery perform sanity checks on the string before passing it to the native parsing function.First of all, you have to make sure that the JSON code is valid.After that, I would recommend using a JavaScript library such as jQuery or Prototype if you can because these things are handled well in those libraries.  On the other hand, if you don\'t want to use a library and you can vouch for the validity of the JSON object, I would simply wrap the string in an anonymous function and use the eval function. This is not recommended if you are getting the JSON object from another source that isn\'t absolutely trusted because the eval function allows for renegade code if you will.  Here is an example of using the eval function:If you control what browser is being used or you are not worried people with an older browser, you can always use the JSON.parse method. This is really the ideal solution for the future.If you are getting this from an outside site it might be helpful to use jquery\'s getJSON.  If it\'s a list you can iterate through it with $.eachIf you want to use JSON 3 for older browsers, you can load it conditionally with:Now the standard window.JSON object is available to you no matter what browser a client is running.The following example will make it clear:ORYou can also use the eval function. The following example is using the eval function:Since the JSON.parse function is more secure and executes faster than the eval function, I recommend you to use JSON.parse function.You can either use the eval function as in some other answers. (Don\'t forget the extra braces.) You will know why when you dig deeper), or simply use the jQuery function parseJSON:OR You can use this below code.And you can access the fields using jsonObject.result and jsonObject.count.If you pass a string variable (a well-formed JSON string) to JSON.parse from MVC @Viewbag that has doublequote, \'"\', as quotes, you need to process it before JSON.parse (jsonstring)The easiest way using parse() method:this is an example of how to get values:Without using a library you can use eval - the only time you should use. It\'s safer to use a library though.eg...JSON.parse() converts any JSON String passed into the function, to a JSON object.For better understanding, press F12 to open the Inspect Element of your browser, and go to the console to write the following commands:Now run the command:You\'ll get output as Object {result: true, count: 1}.In order to use that object, you can assign it to the variable, let\'s say obj:Now by using obj and the dot(.) operator you can access properties of the JSON Object.Try to run the commandIf you likeyou can access the JSON elements by JsonObject with (.) dot:I thought JSON.parse(myObject) would work. But depending on the browsers, it might be worth using eval(\'(\'+myObject+\')\'). The only issue I can recommend watching out for is the multi-level list in JSON. An easy way to do it:If you use Dojo Toolkit:As mentioned by numerous others, most browsers support JSON.parse and JSON.stringify.Now, I\'d also like to add that if you are using AngularJS (which I highly recommend), then it also provides the functionality that you require:I just wanted to add the stuff about AngularJS to provide another option. NOTE that AngularJS doesn\'t officially support Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions, for that matter), though through experience most of the stuff seems to work pretty well.If you use jQuery, it is simple:
