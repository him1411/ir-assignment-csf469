I have a class called Questions (plural). In this class there is an enum called Question (singular) which looks like this.In the Questions class I have a get(int foo) function that returns a Questions object for that foo. Is there an easy way to get the integer value off the enum so I can do something like this Questions.Get(Question.Role)?Just cast the enum eg.The above will work for the vast majority of enums you see in the wild, as the default underlying type for an enum is int.However as cecilphillip  points out, enums can have different underlying types.\nIf an enum is declared as an uint, long or ulong then it should be cast to the type of the enum.e.g. foryou should useSince Enums can be any integral type (short, byte, int, etc.), a more robust way to get the underlying integral value of the enum would be to make use of the GetTypeCode method in conjunction with the Convert classThis should work regardless of the underlying integral type type.Declare it as a static class with constants in it.And then you can reference it as Question.Role and it always evaluates to an int or whatever you define it as.Will result in value == 2.On a related note, if you want to get the int value from System.Enum, then given e here:You can use:The last two are plain ugly. I prefer the first one.It\'s easier than you think - your enum is already an int.  It just needs to be reminded:EDIT: Every enumeration type has an underlying type, which can be any integral type except char.Example:And in the code behind to get enum value:orEnums will increment by 1, and you can set the start value. Else it will be assigned as 0 initially.I was recently converted away from using Enums in my code, in favour of instead using classes with protected constructors and predefined static instances (thanks to Roelof - C# Ensure Valid Enum Values - Futureproof Method).In light of that, below\'s how I\'d now approach this issue (including implicit conversion to/from int).The advantage of this approach is you get everything you would have from the enum, but your code\'s now much more flexible, so should you need to perform different actions based on the value of Question you can put logic into Question itself (i.e. in the preferred OO fashion) as opposed to putting lots of case statements throughout your code to tackle each scenario.If you want to get an integer for the enum value that is stored in a variable, wich the type would be "Question", to use for example in a method, you can simply do this I wrote in this example: This will change the window title to 4, because the variable "Geselecteerd" is "Talen.Nederlands". If I change it to "Talen.Portugees" and call the method again, the text will change to 3.I had a hard time finding this simple solution on the internet and I couldn\'t find it, so I was testing somtehings and found this out. Hope this helps. ;)To ensure an enum value exists and then parse it, you can also do the following.I hope this helps.One more way to do it:Will result in:Maybe I missed it but has anyone tried a simple generic extension method. This works great for me. You can avoid the type cast in your API this way but ultimately it results in a change type operation. This is a good case for programming Roselyn to have the compiler make a GetValue method for you. You can do this by implementing an Extension Method to your defined enum type:This simplify getting int value of current enum value:or...is a fine declaration.You do have to cast the result to int like so:If you don\'t then it\'s type is still QuestionType.I\'m afraid it\'s the C# way to have this level of strictness. An alternative is to use a class declaration instead:It\'s a bit less elegant to declare, but you don\'t need to cast it in code:Alternatively, you may feel more comfortable with Visual Basic, which caters for this type of expectation in many areas.How about a extension method instead:And the usage is slightly prettier:number should have the value 2.The easiest solution I can think of is overloading the Get(int) method like this:where [modifiers] can generally be same as for Get(int) method. If You can\'t edit the Questions class or for some reason don\'t want to, You can overload the method by writing an extension:Try this one instead of convert enum to int:My fav hack with int or smaller enums:For a enum thisoutputs Disclaimer:\nDoesn\'t work for enums based on longThe example I would like to suggest \'to get \'int\' value from enum is,\'now the answer will be 1.I hope this might help someone.In Vb. It should beFollowing is the extension methodTry this :
