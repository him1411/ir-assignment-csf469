How do I get the number of elements in the list?The len() function can be used with a lot of types in Python - both built-in types and library types.To find the size of a list, use the builtin function, len:And now:returns 3.len(s)Return the length (the number of items) of an object. The argument may be a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or\n  a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set).len is implemented with __len__, from the data model docs:object.__len__(self)Called to implement the built-in function len(). Should return the length of the object, an integer >= 0. Also, an object that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\n  define a __nonzero__() [in Python 2 or __bool__() in Python 3] method and whose __len__() method returns zero\n  is considered to be false in a Boolean context.And we can also see that __len__ is a method of lists:returns 3.And in fact we see we can get this information for all of the described types:While this may not be useful due to the fact that it\'d make a lot more sense as being "out of the box" functionality, a fairly simple hack would be to build a class with a length property:You can use it like so:Essentially, it\'s exactly identical to a list object, with the added benefit of having an OOP-friendly length property.As always, your mileage may vary.Answering your question as the examples also given previously:Besides len you can also use operator.length_hint (requires python 3.4+). For normal list both are equivalent but length_hint makes it possible to get the length of a list-iterator, which could be useful in certain circumstances:But length_hint is by definition only a "hint", so most of the time len is better.I\'ve seen several answers suggesting accessing __len__. This is alright when dealing with built-in classes like list but it could lead to problems with custom classes because len (and length_hint) implement some safety checks. For example both do not allow negative lengths or lengths that exceed a certain value (the sys.maxsize value). So it\'s always safer to use the len function instead of the __len__ method!If you need to know MEMORY USAGE of a given type, you can use the function sys.getsizeofThis function works fine for native python types\nhttps://docs.python.org/dev/library/sys.html#sys.getsizeofBut if you need to analyse complex structures, have a look at this recipe.
