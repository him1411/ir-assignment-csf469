I can never remember the number. I need a memory rule.It\'s 2,147,483,647. The easiest way to memorize it is via a tattoo.The most correct answer I can think of is Int32.MaxValue.If you think the value is too hard to remember in base 10, try base 2:\n1111111111111111111111111111111It\'s 10 digits, so pretend it\'s a phone number (assuming you\'re in the US). 214-748-3647. I don\'t recommend calling it. Rather than think of it as one big number, try breaking it down and looking for associated ideas eg:The above applies to the biggest negative number; positive is that minus one.Maybe the above breakdown will be no more memorable for you (it\'s hardly exciting is it!), but hopefully you can come up with some ideas that are!if you can remember the entire Pi number, then the number you are looking for is at the position 1,867,996,680 till 1,867,996,689 of the decimal digits of Pi The numeric string 2147483647 appears at the 1,867,996,680 decimal digit of Pi. 3.14......86181221809936452346214748364710527835665425671614...source: http://www.subidiom.com/pi/Largest negative (32bit) value : -2147483648\n(1 << 31)Largest positive (32bit) value : 2147483647\n~(1 << 31)Mnemonic: "drunk AKA horny"Anyway, take this regex (it determines if the string contains a non-negative Integer in  decimal form that is also not greater than Int32.MaxValue) [0-9]{1,9}|[0-1][0-9]{1,8}|20[0-9]{1,8}|21[0-3][0-9]{1,7}|214[0-6][0-9]{1,7}|2147[0-3][0-9]{1,6}|21474[0-7][0-9]{1,5}|214748[0-2][0-9]{1,4}|2147483[0-5][0-9]{1,3}|21474836[0-3][0-9]{1,2}|214748364[0-7]Maybe it would help you to remember.That\'s how I remembered 2147483647:Write these horizontally:Now you\'ve got 2147483647.Hope this helps at least a bit.So, 2^31 (signed int max) is 2^30 (about 1 billion) times 2^1 (2), or about 2 billion. And 2^32 is 2^30 * 2^2 or about 4 billion. This method of approximation is accurate enough even out to around 2^64 (where the error grows to about 15%).If you need an exact answer then you should pull up a calculator.Handy word-aligned capacity approximations:Just take any decent calculator and type in "7FFFFFFF" in hex mode, then switch to decimal.2147483647.32 bits, one for the sign, 31 bits of information:Why -1?\nBecause the first is zero, so the greatest is the count minus one.EDIT for cantfindaname88The count is 2^31 but the greatest can\'t be 2147483648 (2^31) because we count from 0, not 1.Another explanation with only 3 bits : 1 for the sign, 2 for the informationBelow all the possible values with 3 bits: (2^3 = 8 values)Here\'s a mnemonic for remembering 2**31, subtract one to get the maximum integer value.a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4,e=5,f=6,g=7,h=8,i=9I\'ve used the powers of two up to 18 often enough to remember them, but even I haven\'t bothered memorizing 2**31. It\'s too easy to calculate as needed or use a constant, or estimate as 2G.It\'s about 2.1 * 10^9. No need to know the exact 2^{31} - 1 = 2,147,483,647.You can find it in C like that:gives (well, without the ,)You can get this with Java, too:But keep in mind that Java integers are always signed.Python has arbitrary precision integers. But in Python 2, they are mapped to C integers. So you can do this:So Python switches to long when the integer gets bigger than 2^31 -1Well, it has 32 bits and hence can store 2^32 different values. Half of those are negative.The solution is 2,147,483,647And the lowest is \xe2\x88\x922,147,483,648.(Notice that there is one more negative value.)At this point, I\'d say the easiest mnemonic is to type "stackoverflow.com" TAB "maximum int32" into Chrome.There is a recursion --> stack overflow joke in there somewhere. I\'m just not that geeky.The easiest way to do this for integers is to use hexadecimal, provided that there isn\'t something like Int.maxInt(). The reason is this:Max unsigned valuesSigned values, using 7F as the max signed valueSigned values, using 80 as the max signed valueHow does this work? This is very similar to the binary tactic, and each hex digit is exactly 4 bits. Also, a lot of compilers support hex a lot better than they support binary. So 7F is equal to 01111111 / 7FFF is equal to 0111111111111111. Also, if you are using this for "insanely-high constant", 7F... is safe hex, but it\'s easy enough to try out 7F and 80 and just print them to your screen to see which one it is.0x7FFF + 0x0001 = 0x8000, so your loss is only one number, so using 0x7F... usually isn\'t a bad tradeoff for more reliable code, especially once you start using 32-bits or more2GB(is there a minimum length for answers?)Assuming .NET -First write out 47 twice, (you like Agent 47, right?), keeping spaces as shown (each dash is a slot for a single digit. First 2 slots, then 4)Think you have 12 in hand (because 12 = a dozen). Multiply it by 4, first digit of Agent 47\'s number, i.e. 47, and place the result to the right of first pair you already haveThen multiply 12 by 3 (in order to make second digit of Agent 47\'s number, which is 7, you need 7 - 4 = 3) and put the result to the right of the first 2 pairs, the last pair-slotFinally drag digits one by one from your hand staring from right-most digit (2 in this case) and place them in the first empty slot you getThere you have it! For negative limit, you can think of that as 1 more in absolute value than the positive limit.Practise a few times, and you will get the hang of it!The easiest way to remember is to look at  std::numeric_limits< int >::max()For example (from MSDN),If you happen to know your ASCII table off by heart and not MaxInt :\n!GH6G = 21 47 48 36 47The best rule to memorize it is:\n21 (magic number!)\n47 (just remember it)\n48 (sequential!)\n36 (21 + 15, both magics!)\n47 againAlso it is easier to remember 5 pairs than 10 digits.Just remember that 2^(10*x) is approximately 10^(3*x) - you\'re probably already used to this with kilobytes/kibibytes etc.  That is:Since an int uses 31 bits (+ ~1 bit for the sign), just double 2^30 to get approximately 2 billion.  For an unsigned int using 32 bits, double again for 4 billion.  The error factor gets higher the larger you go of course, but you don\'t need the exact value memorised (If you need it, you should be using a pre-defined constant for it anyway).  The approximate value is good enough for noticing when something might be a dangerously close to overflowing.Interestingly, Int32.MaxValue has more characters than 2,147,486,647.But then again, we do have code completion,So I guess all we really have to memorize is Int3<period>M<enter>, which is only 6 characters to type in visual studio.UPDATE\nFor some reason I was downvoted. The only reason I can think of is that they didn\'t understand my first statement."Int32.MaxValue" takes at most 14 characters to type.\n2,147,486,647 takes either 10 or 13 characters to type depending on if you put the commas in or not.What do you mean? It should be easy enough to remember that it is 2^32.\nIf you want a rule to memorize the value of that number, a handy rule of thumb is for converting between binary and decimal in general:2^10 ~ 1000which means 2^20 ~ 1,000,000and 2^30 ~ 1,000,000,000Double that (2^31) is rounghly 2 billion, and doubling that again (2^32) is 4 billion.It\'s an easy way to get a rough estimate of any binary number. 10 zeroes in binary becomes 3 zeroes in decimal.In Objective-C (iOS & OSX), just remember these macros:Int32 means you have 32 bits available to store your number. The highest bit is the sign-bit, this indicates if the number is positive or negative. So you have 2^31 bits for positive and negative numbers. With zero being a positive number you get the logical range of (mentioned before)+2147483647 to -2147483648If you think that is to small, use Int64:+9223372036854775807 to -9223372036854775808And why the hell you want to remember this number? To use in your code? You should always use Int32.MaxValue or Int32.MinValue in your code since these are static values (within the .net core) and thus faster in use than creating a new int with code.My statement: if know this number by memory.. you\'re just showing off!this is how i do it to remember 2,147,483,647Remember this:\n21 IQ ITEM 47It can be de-encoded with any phone pad, or you can just write one down yourself on a paper.In order to remember "21 IQ ITEM 47", I would go with "Hitman:Codename 47 had 21 missions, which were each IQ ITEM\'s by themselves".Or "I clean teeth at 21:47 every day, because I have high IQ and don\'t like items in my mouth".
