I have a div element which contains text, and I want to align the contents of this div vertically center.Here is my div style:What is the best way to do this?You can try this basic approach:It only works for a single line of text though, because we set the line\'s height to the same height as the containing box element.This is another way to align text vertically. This solution will work for a single line and multiple lines of text, but it still requires a fixed height container:The CSS just sizes the <div>, vertically center aligns the <span> by setting the <div>\'s line-height equal to its height, and makes the <span> an inline-block with vertical-align: middle. Then it sets the line-height back to normal for the <span>, so its contents will flow naturally inside the block.And here is another option, which may not work on older browsers that don\'t support display: table and display: table-cell (basically just Internet Explorer 7). Using CSS we simulate table behavior (since tables support vertical alignment), and the HTML is the same as the second example:This technique uses an absolutely positioned element setting top, bottom, left and right to 0. It is described in more detail in an article in Smashing Magazine, Absolute Horizontal And Vertical Centering In CSS.Another way (not mentioned here yet) is with Flexbox.Just add the following code to the container element:Alternatively, instead of aligning the content via the container, flexbox can also center the a flex item with an auto margin when there is only one flex-item in the flex container (like the example given in the question above).So to center the flex item both horizontally and vertically just set it with margin:autoNB: All the above applies to centering items while laying them out in horizontal rows. This is also the default behavior, because by default the value for flex-direction is row. If, however flex-items need to be laid out in vertical columns, then flex-direction: column should be set on the container to set the main-axis as column and additionally the justify-content and align-items properties now work the other way around with justify-content: center centering vertically and  align-items: center centering horizontally)A good place to start with Flexbox to see some of it\'s features and get syntax for maximum browser support is flexyboxes Also, browser support nowadays is very good: caniuseFor cross-browser compatibility for display: flex and align-items, you can use the following:You can easily do this by adding the following piece of CSS code:That means your CSS finally looks like:For reference and to add a simpler answer:Pure CSS:Or as a SASS/SCSS Mixin:Use by:By Sebastian Ekstr\xc3\xb6m\'s blog post Vertical align anything with just 3 lines of CSS:This method can cause elements to be blurry due to the element being placed on a \xe2\x80\x9chalf pixel\xe2\x80\x9d. A solution for this is to set its parent element to preserve-3d. Like following:We live in 2015+ and Flex Box is supported by every major modern browser.It will be the way websites are made from here on out.Learn it!All credit goes to this link owner @Sebastian Ekstr\xc3\xb6m Link; please go through this. See it in action codepen. By reading the above article I also created a demo fiddle.With just three lines of CSS (excluding vendor prefixes) we can do it with the help of a transform: translateY vertically centers whatever we want, even if we don\xe2\x80\x99t know its height.The CSS property transform is usually used for rotating and scaling elements, but with its translateY function we can now vertically align elements. Usually this must be done with absolute positioning or setting line-heights, but these require you to either know the height of the element or only works on single-line text, etc.So, to do this we write:That\xe2\x80\x99s all you need. It is a similar technique to the absolute-position method, but with the upside that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to set any height on the element or position-property on the parent. It works straight out of the box, even in Internet Explorer 9!To make it even more simple, we can write it as a mixin with its vendor prefixes.The solution accepted as the answer is perfect to use line-height the same as the height of div, but this solution does not work perfectly when text is wrapped OR is in two lines.Try this one if text is wrapped or is on multiple lines inside a div.For more reference, see:Vertically Center Multi-Lined Text6 Methods For Vertical Centering With CSSFlexible approachFlexboxes that introduced in CSS3, is the solution:Another way:Don\'t set the height attribute of the div, but instead use padding: to achieve the effect.  Similarly to line-height, it only works if you have one line of text.  Although this way, if you have more content, the text will still be centered, but the div itself will be slightly larger.So instead of going with:You can say:This will set the top and bottom padding of the div to 60px, and the left and right padding to zero, making the div 120px (plus the height of your font) high, and placing the text vertically centered in the div.You can also use below properties.Try this solution:Built using CSS+.You can use the following code snippet as the reference. It is working like a charm for me:The OutPut of the above code snippet is as follow:Source Code Credit: How do I vertically center text with CSS? - Code PuranFor all your vertical alignment needs!Declare this Mixin:Then include it in your element:I\'m not sure anyone has gone the writing-mode route, but I think it solves the problem cleanly and has a broad support:This will, of course, work with any dimensions you need (besides 100% of the parent). If you uncomment the border lines, it\'ll be helpful to familiarize yourself.JSFiddle demo for you to fiddle.Caniuse support: 85.22% + 6.26% = 91.48% (even IE is in!)Try the transform property:I would just like to extend the answer from @michielvoo in order to release need for line-height and breathing of div height. It is basically just simplified version like this:NOTE: commented out part of cssis needed for fixed-height of enclosing div.For a single line of text (or a single character) you can use this technique:It can be used when #box has non-fixed, relative height in %.<div id="box"></div>See live demo at JsBin (easier to edit CSS) or JsFiddle (easier to change height of result frame).If you want to place inner text in HTML, not in CSS, then you need to wrap text content in additional inline element and edit #box::after to match it. (And, of course, content: property should be removed.)\nFor example,\n<div id="box"><span>TextContent</span></div>\nIn this case #box::after should be replaced to #box span.For IE8 support you must replace :: with :.The simple and versatile way is (as michielvoo table approach):Using this attribute (or a equivalent class) on a parent tag works even for many childs to align:A better, easier, responsive approach is to set margin-top in CSS to around 45%:You might have to play with that number, but it will be in the center of the surrounding div.Add this small code in the CSS property of your element. It is awesome. Try it!A very simple & most powerful solution to vertically align center:Set it within button instead of div if you don\'t care about its little visually 3d effect. Wherever you want vertically center style means you can try display:table-cell and vertical-align:middle.Example:I needed a row of clickable elephants, vertically centered, but without using a table to get around some Internet Explorer 9 weirdness. I eventually found the nicest CSS (for my needs) and it\'s great in Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer 11 .. sadly Internet Explorer 9 is still laughing at me :( Someone might find this handy...(Obviously you don\'t need the borders, but they can help you see how it works!)Here is working code:ResultNewer browsers now support the CSS calc function. If you are targeting these browsers you may want to look into doing something like this:The key is to use style = "top: calc(50% - [innerFixedHeightInPX/2]px); height: [innerFixedHeightInPX]px;" inside an absolute or relatively positioned parent div.Try this:
