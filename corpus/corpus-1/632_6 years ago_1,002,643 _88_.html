How can you align an image inside of a containing div?In my example, I need to vertically center the <img> in the <div> with class ="frame"` :.frame\'s height is fixed and image\'s height is unknown. I can add new elements in .frame if that\'s the only solution. I\'m trying to do this on IE\xe2\x89\xa57, Webkit, Gecko.See the jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/4RPFa/61/The only (and the best cross-browser) way as I know is to use an inline-block helper with height: 100% and vertical-align: middle on both elements.So there is a solution: http://jsfiddle.net/kizu/4RPFa/4570/Or, if you don\'t want to have an extra element in modern browsers and don\'t mind using IE expressions, you can use a pseudo-element and add it to IE using a convenient Expression, that runs only once per element, so there won\'t be any performance issues:The solution with :before and expression() for IE: http://jsfiddle.net/kizu/4RPFa/4571/How it works:When you have two inline-block elements near each other, you can align each to other\'s side, so with vertical-align: middle you\'ll get something like this:When you have a block with fixed height (in px, em or other absolute unit), you can set the height of inner blocks in %.This might be useful: Reference : http://www.student.oulu.fi/~laurirai/www/css/middle/matejkramny\'s solution is a good start, but oversized images have a wrong ratio.\nHere\'s my fork:demo: https://jsbin.com/lidebapomi/edit?html,css,outputCSS:A PURE CSS Solution:http://jsfiddle.net/3MVPM/ The CSS: Key stuff  3 line solution:This applies to anything.From here.This way you can center an image vertically (demo):For those that landed on this post and are interested in a more modern solution, and that have no need to support legacy browsers, you can do this:Here\'s a Pen: http://codepen.io/ricardozea/pen/aa0ee8e6021087b6e2460664a0fa3f3eYou could try setting the CSS of PI to display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle;http://jsfiddle.net/MBs64/The key property is display: table-cell; for .frame. Div.frame is displayed as inline with this, so you need to wrap it in a block element.This works in FF, Opera, Chrome, Safari and IE8+.UPDATEFor IE7 we need to add a css expression:Background image solution\nI removed the image element all together and set it as background of the div with a class of .framehttp://jsfiddle.net/URVKa/2/this at least works fine on IE8, FF6 and Chrome13I checked, this solution will not work to shrink images larger then 25px height. There is a property called background-size which does set the size of the element, but it is CSS3 which would conflict with IE7 requirement.I wouldd advice you to either redo your browser priorities and design for the best available browsers, or get some serverside code to resize the images if you\'d want to use this solutionYou could do this:http://jsfiddle.net/DZ8vW/1Not sure about IE, but under Firefox and Chrome, if you have a img in a div container, the following css should work. At least for me works well:You can try below code Try this solution with with pure css http://jsfiddle.net/sandeep/4RPFa/72/\nMay be the main problem with your html. Your not use quote when you define class & image height in your html. CSS:EDIT :When i work around with the img tag it\'s leave 3px to 2px space from top. Now i decrease line-height & it\'s work.\n css:the line-height property is render differently in different browsers. So; we have to define different line-height property browsers Check this example http://jsfiddle.net/sandeep/4be8t/11/Check this example about line-height different in different browsers input height differences in Firefox and ChromeMy solution: http://jsfiddle.net/XNAj6/2/There is a super easy solution with flexbox!This works for modern browsers (2016 at time of edit) as shown in this demo on codepenIt is very important that you either give the images a class or use inheritance to target the images that you need centered. In this example we used .frame img {} so that only images wrapped by a div with a class of .frame would be targeted.If you can live with pixel-sized margins, just add font-size: 1px; to the .frame. But remember, that now on the .frame 1em = 1px, which means, you need to set the margin in pixels too.http://jsfiddle.net/feeela/4RPFa/96/EDIT: now its not centered anymore in Opera\xe2\x80\xa6Easy way which work for me:Works for Google Chrome very well. Try this one out on different browser.Sometimes it should be solved by displaying as table/table-cell. For example a fast title screen. It is a recommended way by W3 also. I recommend you check this link called Centering things from W3C.orgThe tips used here are:Personally I actually disagree about use helpers for this purposeI had the same problem. This works for me:Want to align a image wich have after a text / title and both are inside a div?See on JSfiddle or Run Code Snippet.Just be sure to have an ID or a class at all your elements(div, img, title, etc).For me works this solution on all browsers(for mobile devices you must to adapt your code with: @media).The best solution is thatI have been playing around with using padding for center alignment. You will need to define the top level outer-container size, but the inner container should resize, and you can set the padding at different percentage values.jsfiddlehow about this one?and you can vary font-sizeYou can use table structure inside a divUsing table and table-cell method do the job, specially because you targeting some old browsers as well, I create a snippet for you which you can run it and check the result:\nFor centering an image inside a container (it could be a logo) besides some text like this:Basically you wrap the image The old JSFiddle link I posted here didnt work anymore, thats probably the reason for the downvote. Just for the sake of this being a valid answer i still want to post the jQuery solution again. This works for every element that has the v_align class applied to it. It will be vertical centered in the parent and on resizing of the window it will be recalculated.Link to the JSFiddle
