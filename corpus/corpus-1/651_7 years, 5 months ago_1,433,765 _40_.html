It\'s easy to find duplicates with one field:So if we have a tableThis query will give us John, Sam, Tom, Tom because they all have the same email.However, what I want is to get duplicates with the same email and name.That is, I want to get "Tom", "Tom".The reason I need this: I made a mistake, and allowed to insert duplicate name and email values. Now I need to remove/change the duplicates, so I need to find them first.Simply group on both of the columns.Note: the ANSI standard is to have all non aggregated columns in the GROUP BY.\nMySQL allows you to avoid this, but results are unpredictable:In MySQL you need sql_mode=only_full_group_bytry this:OUTPUT:if you want the IDs of the dups use this:OUTPUT:to delete the duplicates try:OUTPUT: Try this:If you want to delete the duplicates, here\'s a much simpler way to do it than having to find even/odd rows into a triple sub-select:And so to delete:Much more easier to read and understand IMHONote: The only issue is that you have to execute the request until there is no rows deleted, since you delete only 1 of each duplicate each timeTry the following:A little late to the party but I found a really cool workaround to finding all duplicate IDs:In case you work with Oracle, this way would be preferable:try this codeIf you wish to see if there is any duplicate rows in your table, I used below Query:How we can count the duplicated values??\neither it is repeated 2 times or greater than 2.\njust count them, not group wise.as simple as This selects/deletes all duplicate records except one record from each group of duplicities. So, the delete leaves all unique records + one record from each group of the duplicities.Select duplicities:Delete duplicities:Be aware of larger amounts of records, it can cause performance problems. This should also work, maybe give it try.Especially good in your case If you search for duplicates who have some kind of prefix or general change like e.g.  new domain in mail. then you can use replace() at these columnsThis is the easy thing I\'ve come up with.  It uses a common table expression (CTE) and a partition window (I think these features are in SQL 2008 and later).This example finds all students with duplicate name and dob.  The fields you want to check for duplication go in the OVER clause.  You can include any other fields you want in the projection.If you want to find duplicate data (by one or several criterias) and select the actual rows.http://developer.azurewebsites.net/2014/09/better-sql-group-by-find-duplicate-data/SELECT id, COUNT(id) FROM table1 GROUP BY id HAVING COUNT(id)>1;I think this will work properly to search repeated values in a particular column.By Using CTE also we can find duplicate value like this
