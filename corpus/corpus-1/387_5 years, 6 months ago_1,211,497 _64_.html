My colleague and I are working on the same repository we\'ve branched it into two branches each technically for different projects, but they have similarities so we\'ll sometimes want to commit back to the *master from the branch.However, I have the branch, how can my colleague pull that branch specifically. A git clone of the repo does not seem to create the branches locally for him, though I can see them live on unfuddle after a push my end.Also, when I originally made the branch I did -b checkout. Not sure if that makes much difference?This is the commands I ran. But definitely not working. I want to be able to check out that branch and then push and commit back just that branches changes from various collaborators or workstations.You need to create a local branch that tracks a remote branch. The following command will create a local branch named daves_branch, tracking the remote branch origin/daves_branch. When you push your changes the remote branch will be updated.For most versions of git:--track is shorthand for git checkout -b [branch] [remotename]/[branch] where [remotename] is origin in this case and [branch] is twice the same, daves_branch in this case.For git 1.5.6.5 you needed this: For git 1.7.2.3 and higher this is enough (might have started earlier but this is the earliest confirmation I could find quickly):Note that with recent git versions, this will command not create a local branch and will put you in a \'detached HEAD\' state. If you want a local branch, use the --track option.\nFull details here: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches#Tracking-BranchesI have used fetch followed by checkout ...... where <rbranch> is the remote branch or source ref and <lbranch> is the as yet non-existent local branch or destination ref you want to track and which you probably want to name the same as the remote branch or source ref. This is explained under options in the explanation of <refspec>.Git is so smart it auto completes the first command if I tab after the first few letters of the remote branch. IE: I don\'t even have to name the local branch, Git automatically copies the name of the remote branch for me. Thanks Git!Also as the answer in this similar SO post shows, if you don\'t name the local branch in fetch, you can still create it when you check it out by using the -b flag. IE: git fetch <remote> <branch> followed by git checkout -b <branch> <remote>/<branch> does exactly the same as my initial answer. And evidently if your repo has only one remote, then you can just do git checkout <branch> after fetch and it will create a local branch for you. EG: You just cloned a repo and want to check out additional branches from the remote.I believe that some of the documentation for fetch may have been copied verbatim from pull. In particular the section on <refspec> in options is the same. However, I do not believe that fetch will ever merge, so that if you leave the destination side of the colon empty fetch should do nothing.NOTE: That git fetch <remote> <refspec> is short for git fetch <remote> <refspec>: which would therefore do nothing, but git fetch <remote> <tag> is the same as git fetch <remote> <tag>:<tag> which should copy the remote <tag> locally.I guess this is only helpful if you want to copy a remote branch locally, but not necessarily check it out right away. Otherwise I now would use the accepted answer above, which is explained in detail in the first section of the checkout description and later in the options section under the explanation of --track, since it\'s a 1-liner. Well... sort of a 1-liner, because you would still have to run git fetch <remote> first.FYI: The order of the <refspecs> (source:destination) explains the bizarre pre Git-1.7 method for deleting remote branches. IE: Push nothing into the destination refspec.If you are trying to "checkout" a new remote branch (that exists only on the remote, but not locally), here\'s what you\'ll need:This assumes you want to fetch from origin. If not, replace origin by your remote name.To checkout myBranch that exists remotely and not a locally - This worked for me:I got this message:The title and the question are confused:If the question is how can I get a remote branch to work with or how to git checkout a remote branch, a simpler solution is:With git (>= 1.6.6) you are able to use:If local <branch_name> is not found but there does exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote with a matching name, treat as equivalent to:see documentation for git checkoutFor your friend:Use git branch -a (both local and remote branches) or git branch -r (only remote branches) to see all the remotes and their branches. You can then do a git checkout -t remotes/repo/branch to the remote and create a local branch.There is also a git ls-remote command to see all the refs and tags for that remote.This is a common enough operation that git provides the --track shorthand:In fact, this is so common that there\xe2\x80\x99s even a shortcut for that shortcut. If the branch name you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to checkout (a) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist and (b) exactly matches a name on only one remote, Git will create a tracking branch for you:To set up a local branch with a different name than the remote branch, you can easily use the first version with a different local branch name:Now, your local branch sf will automatically pull from origin/serverfix.Source: Pro Git 2nd Edition, written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub (cut for readability)You can fetch and checkout the remote branch in one shot too:-I typedand gotAt times you are asked not to fiddle with the master branch and work only the remote branch (as I was asked to). So all you need is the remote branch.So to clone the remote branch alone (without the master), do thiswhere,\nremote_branch_name is the name of the remote branchFor example,This will make sure that you clone the remote branch to your local branch with the name of the remote branch.Now if you commit your code and push, the code will be submitted to that branch alone.The steps are as follows;git fetch origin or git fetch --all , this will fetch all the remote branches to your local and then this the second option you can proced with.git checkout --track origin/<The_remote_branch you want to switch over>Then work on this branch and you can verify whether you are on that branch or not by  typing It displayes the branch you currently in.If you already know your remote branch like so...and you know the branch name you wish to checkout ex. br1.2.3.4 then do all that is left is to checkout the branchThen make any new branches off of it.You use \'git pull\' to keep your branches separate. I will use actual repo and branch names to help since \'lbranch\' and \'rbranch\' is tough to decipher.  Let\'s use:\nYou, or any colleague, can run this to pull only your branch, no matter how many branches there are:Simple command:git checkout -b \'your_branch\' origin/\'remote branch\'Check your .git/config, particulary what tracking is present on fetch for that remote.If it has heads/* pointing to randomRemote/*, when you run git fetch randomRemote, it will fetch all branches.\nThen you can just checkout that branch.Otherwise,You need to add remote branches to the tracking using this. Check your .git/config after running this. You will understand. \ngit remote set-branches --add randomRemote randomBranchRun git fetch randomRemote. This will fetch the remote branch.Now you can run git checkout randomBranch
