I understand that a .gitignore file cloaks specified files from Git\'s version\ncontrol. I have a project (LaTeX) that generates lots of extra files (.auth,\n.dvi, .pdf, logs, etc) as it runs, but I don\'t want those to be tracked.I\'m aware that I could (maybe should) make it so all those files are put in an\nseparate subfolder in the project, since I could then just ignore the folder.However, is there any feasible way to keep the output files in the root of the\nproject tree and use .gitignore to ignore everything except the files I\'m\ntracking with Git? Something likeAn optional prefix ! which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by\n  a previous pattern will become included again. If a negated pattern matches,\n  this will override lower precedence patterns sources.If you want to ignore the whole content of a directory except one file inside it, you could write a pair of rules for each directory in the file path.\nEg .gitignore to ignore the pippo folder except from pippo/pluto/paperino.xmlYou want to use /* instead of * or */ in most casesUsing * is valid, but it works recursively.  It won\'t look into directories from then on out.  People recommend using !*/ to whitelist directories again, but it\'s actually better to blacklist the highest level folder with /*The above code would ignore all files except for .gitignore, README.md, folder/a/b1/ and folder/a/b2/ and everything contained in those two folders. (And .DS_Store files would be ignored in those folders.)Obviously I could do e.g. !/folder or !/.gitignore too.More info: http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignoreA little more specific: Example: Ignore everything in webroot/cache - but keep webroot/cache/.htaccess. Notice the slash (/) after the cache folder:FAILSWORKSTo ignore some files in a directory, you have to do this in the correct order:For example, ignore everything in folder "application" except index.php and folder "config" pay attention to the order. You must negate want you want first.FAILSapplication/*!application/config/*!application/index.phpWORKS!application/config/*!application/index.phpapplication/*You can use git config status.showUntrackedFiles no and all untracked files will be hidden from you. See man git-config for details.To exclude folder from .gitignore, the following can be done.This will ignore all files/subfolders inside bower_components except for /highcharts.There are a bunch of similar questions about this, so I\'ll post what I wrote before:The only way I got this to work on my machine was to do it this way:Notice how you have to explicitly allow content for each level you want to include. So if I have subdirectories 5 deep under themes, I still need to spell that out.This is from @Yarin\'s comment here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5250314/1696153These were useful topics:I also tried and **/wp-content/themes/**or /wp-content/themes/**/*None of that worked for me, either. Lots of trail and error!That\'s what have worked for me, I wanted to commit only one Cordova plugin to the repo:I have Jquery and Angular from bower. Bower installed them in The minimized jquery is inside the dist directory and angular is inside angular directory. I only needed minimized files to be commited to github. Some tampering with .gitignore and this is what I managed to conjure...Hope someone could find this useful.
