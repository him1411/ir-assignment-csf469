I\'m refactoring some old JavaScript code and there\'s a lot of DOM manipulation going on.I would like to know if there is a better way to do this using jQuery. I\'ve been experimenting with:But I\'m not sure if this is any better.here\'s your example in "one" line.Update: I thought I\'d update this post since it still gets quite a bit of traffic. In the comments below there\'s some discussion about $("<div>") vs $("<div></div>") vs $(document.createElement(\'div\')) as a way of creating new elements, and which is "best".I put together a small benchmark, and here\'s roughly the results of repeating the above options 100,000 times:jQuery 1.4, 1.5, 1.6jQuery 1.3jQuery 1.2I think it\'s no big surprise, but document.createElement is the fastest method. Of course, before you go off and start refactoring your entire codebase, remember that the differences we\'re talking about here (in all but the archaic versions of jQuery) equate to about an extra 3 milliseconds per thousand elements. Update 2Updated for jQuery 1.7.2 and put the benchmark on JSBen.ch which is probably a bit more scientific than my primitive benchmarks, plus it can be crowdsourced now!http://jsben.ch/#/ARUtzSimply supplying the HTML of elements you want to add to a jQuery constructor $() will return a jQuery object from newly built HTML, suitable for being appended into the DOM using jQuery\'s append() method.For example:You could then populate this table programmatically, if you wished.This gives you the ability to specify any arbitrary HTML you like, including class names or other attributes, which you might find more concise than using createElement and then setting attributes like cellSpacing and className via JS.  Creating new DOM elements is a core feature of the jQuery() method, see:Cheers.since jQuery1.8, using $.parseHTML() to create elements is a better choice.there are two benefits:1.if you use the old way, which may be something like $(string), jQuery will examine the string to make sure you want to select a html tag or create a new element. By using $.parseHTML(), you tell jQuery that you want to create a new element explicitly, so the performance may be a little better.2.much more important thing is that you may suffer from cross site attack (more info) if you use the old way. if you have something like:a bad guy can input <script src="xss-attach.js"></script> to tease you. fortunately, $.parseHTML() avoid this embarrassment for you:However, please notice that a is a jQuery object while b is a html element:I feel using document.createElement(\'div\') together with jQuery is faster:I\'m doing like that:Though this is a very old question, I thought it would be nice to update it with the recent information;Since jQuery 1.8 there is a jQuery.parseHTML() function which is now a preferred way of creating elements. Also, there are some issues with parsing HTML via $(\'(html code goes here)\'), fo example official jQuery website mentions the following in one of their release notes:Relaxed HTML parsing: You can once again have leading spaces or\n  newlines before tags in $(htmlString). We still strongly advise that\n  you use $.parseHTML() when parsing HTML obtained from external\n  sources, and may be making further changes to HTML parsing in the\n  future.To relate to the actual question, provided example could be translated to:which is unfortunately less convenient than using just $(), but it gives you more control, for example you may choose to exclude script tags (it will leave inline scripts like onclick though):Also, here\'s a benchmark from the top answer adjusted to the new reality:JSbin LinkjQuery 1.9.1It looks like parseHTML is much closer to createElement than $(), but all the boost is gone after wrapping the results in a new jQuery objectIs the shortest/easiest way to create a DIV element in jQuery.It\'s all pretty straight forward! Heres a couple quick examples...I\'ve just made a small jQuery plugin for that: https://github.com/ern0/jquery.createIt follows your syntax:DOM node ID can be specified as second parameter:Is it serious? No. But this syntax is better than $("<div></div>"), and it\'s a very good value for that money.I\'m a new jQuery user, switching from DOMAssistant, which has a similar function: http://www.domassistant.com/documentation/DOMAssistantContent-module.phpMy plugin is simpler, I think attrs and content is better to add by chaining methods:Also, it\'s a good example for a simple jQuery-plugin (the 100th one).It seems that element creation will only get you so far. Once you start chaining, the performance difference is negligible.http://jsperf.com/jquery-dom-node-creationAm I missing something?jQuery out of the box doesn\'t have the equivalent of a createElement.  In fact the majority of jQuery\'s work is done internally using innerHTML over pure DOM manipulation.  As Adam mentioned above this is how you can achieve similar results.There are also plugins available that make use of the DOM over innerHTML like appendDOM, DOMEC and FlyDOM just to name a few.  Performance wise the native jquery is still the most performant (mainly becasue it uses innerHTML)
