What I am looking for:A way to style one HALF of a character. (In this case, half the letter being transparent)What I have currently searched for and tried (With no luck):Below is an example of what I am trying to obtain.Does a CSS or JavaScript solution exist for this, or am I going to have to resort to images? I would prefer not to go the image route as this text will end up being generated dynamically.UPDATE:Since many have asked why I would ever want to style half of a character, this is why. My city had recently spent $250,000 to define a new "brand" for itself. This logo is what they came up with. Many people have complained about the simplicity and lack of creativity and continue to do so. My goal was to come up with this website as a joke. Type in \'Halifax\' and you will see what I mean. :) Feel free to fork and improve.Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/arbel/pd9yB/1362/This works on any dynamic text, or a single character, and is all automated. All you need to do is add a class on the target text and the rest is taken care of.Also, the accessibility of the original text is preserved for screen readers for the blind or visually impaired.Explanation for a single character:Pure CSS. All you need to do is to apply .halfStyle class to each element that contains the character you want to be half-styled.For each span element containing the character, you can create a data attribute, for example here data-content="X", and on the pseudo element use content: attr(data-content); so the .halfStyle:before class will be dynamic and you won\'t need to hard code it for every instance.Explanation for any text:Simply add textToHalfStyle class to the element containing the text.CSS:HTMLTo make it automated, simply add textToHalfStyle class to the element containing the text.jQuery for automated mode:Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/arbel/pd9yB/1363/With this solution you can style left and right parts, individually and independently.Everything is the same, only more advanced CSS does the magic.Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/arbel/pd9yB/1363/Now that we know what is possible, let\'s create some variations.Customized different Half-Style style-sets can be used on desired elements on the same page.\nYou can define multiple style-sets and tell the plugin which one to use.The plugin uses data attribute data-halfstyle="[-CustomClassName-]" on the target .textToHalfStyle elements and makes all the necessary changes automatically.So, simply on the element containing the text add textToHalfStyle class and data attribute data-halfstyle="[-CustomClassName-]". The plugin will do the rest of the job.Also the CSS style-sets\' class definitions match the [-CustomClassName-] part mentioned above and is chained to .halfStyle, so we will have .halfStyle.[-CustomClassName-]HTML:I\'ve just finished developing the plugin and it is available for everyone to use! Hope you will enjoy it. First of all, make sure you have the jQuery library is included. The best way to get the latest jQuery version is to update your head tag with:After downloading the files, make sure you include them in your project:All you have to do is to asign the class splitchar , followed by the desired style to the element wrapping your text. e.gAfter all this is done, just make sure you call the jQuery function in your document ready file like this:In order to make the text look exactly as you want it to, all you have to do is apply your design like this:\nThat\'s it! Now you have the Splitchar plugin all set. More info about it at http://razvanbalosin.com/Splitchar.js/.Yes, you can do this with only one character and only CSS. Webkit (and Chrome) only, though:http://jsbin.com/rexoyice/1/Visually, all the examples that use two characters (be it via JS, CSS pseudo elements, or just HTML) look fine, but note that that all adds content to the DOM which may cause accessibility--as well as text selection/cut/paste issues. We\'ll do it using just CSS pseudo selectors! This technique will work with dynamically generated content and different font sizes and widths.HTML:CSS:To wrap the dynamically generated string, you could use a function like this:It may be irrelevant, maybe not, but sometime ago, I created a jQuery function that does the same thing, but horizontally.I called it "Strippex" For \'stripe\'+\'text\', demo : http://cdpn.io/FcIBgI\'m not saying this is the solution of any problems, but I already tried to apply css to half of a character, but horizontally, So the idea is the same, the realisation may be horrible, but it works.Ah, and the most important, I had fun creating it !Here an ugly implementation in canvas. I tried this solution, but the results are worse than I expected, so here it is anyway.http://jsfiddle.net/kLXmL/2/If you are interested in this, then Lucas Bebber\'s Glitch is a very similar and super cool effect:Created using a simple SASS Mixin such asMore details at Chris Coyer\'s CSS Tricks and Lucas Bebber\'s Codepen pageClosest I can get:Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/9wxfY/2/Heres a version that just uses one span: http://jsfiddle.net/9wxfY/4/Nice trick, CSS is everything :)I just played with @Arbel\'s solution:Another CSS-only solution (though data-attribute is needed if you don\'t want to write letter-specific CSS). This one works more across the board (Tested IE 9/10, Chrome latest & FF latest)Limited CSS and jQuery SolutionI am not sure how elegant this solution is, but it cuts everything exactly in half: http://jsfiddle.net/9wxfY/11/Otherwise, I have created a nice solution for you... All you need to do is have this for your HTML:Take a look at this most recent, and accurate, edit as of 6/13/2016 : http://jsfiddle.net/9wxfY/43/As for the CSS, it is very limited... You only need to apply it to :nth-child(even)http://experimental.samtremaine.co.uk/half-style/You can crowbar this code into doing all sorts of interesting things - this is just one implementation my associate and I came up with last night.A nice WebKit-only solution that takes advantage of the background-clip: text support: http://jsfiddle.net/sandro_paganotti/wLkVt/FWIW, here\'s my take on this doing it only with CSS: http://codepen.io/ricardozea/pen/uFbts/Several notes:The main reason I did this was to test myself and see if I was able to accomplish styling half of a character while actually providing a meaningful answer to the OP.I am aware that this is not an ideal or the most scalable solution and the solutions proposed by the people here are far better for "real world" scenarios.The CSS code I created is based on the first thoughts that came to my mind and my own personal approach to the problem.My solution only works on symmetrical characters, like X, A, O, M. **It does not work on asymmetric characters like B, C, F, K or lower case letters.** HOWEVER, this approach creates very interesting \'shapes\' with asymmetric characters. Try changing the X to a K or to a lower case letter like an h or a p in the CSS :)HTMLSCSSYou can also do it using SVG, if you wish:http://codepen.io/nicbell/pen/jGcbqThis can be achieved with just CSS :before selector and content property value.>> See on jsFiddleYou can use below code. Here in this example I have used h1 tag and added an attribute data-title-text="Display Text" which will appear with different color text on h1 tag text element ,which gives effect halfcolored text as shown in below example How about something like this for shorter text? It could even works for longer characters if you do something loop and repeating over the characters with javascript, anyway the result is something like this:
