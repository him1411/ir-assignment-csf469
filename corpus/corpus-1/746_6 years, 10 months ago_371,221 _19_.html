I have a script that works fine in one branch and is broken in another. I want to look at the two versions side-by-side and see what\'s different. Are there any ways to do this?To be clear I\'m not looking for a compare tool (I use Beyond Compare). I\'m looking for a git diff command that will allow me to compare the master version to my current branch version to see what has changed. I\'m not in the middle of a merge or anything. I just want to say something like git diff can show you the difference between two commits:Or, equivalently:Using the latter syntax, if either side is HEAD it may be omitted (e.g. master.. compares master to HEAD).You may also be interested in mybranch...master (from git diff docs):This form is to view the changes on the branch containing and up to the second <commit>, starting at a common ancestor of both <commit>. git diff A...B is equivalent to git diff $(git-merge-base A B) B.In other words, this will give a diff of changes in master since it diverged from mybranch (but without new changes since then in mybranch).In all cases, the -- separator before the file name indicates the end of command line flags. This is optional unless Git will get confused if the argument refers to a commit or a file, but including it is not a bad habit to get into. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/13321491/54249 for a few examples.The same arguments can be passed to git difftool if you have one configured.You can do this:\ngit diff branch1:file branch2:fileIf you have difftool configured, then you can also:\ngit difftool branch1:file branch2:fileRelated question:\nHow do I view git diff output with visual diff programMore modern syntax:git diff ..master path/to/fileThe double-dot prefix means "from the current working directory to".  You can also say:I simply do git diff branch1 branch2 path/to/fileThis checks for differences between the files. Changes in branch1 would be in red. Changes in branch2 would be in green.It\'s assumed that branch1 is the past and branch2 is the future. You can reverse this by reversing the order of the branches in the diff: git diff branch2 branch1
