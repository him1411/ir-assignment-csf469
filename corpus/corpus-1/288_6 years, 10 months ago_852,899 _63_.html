I cloned my repository with:but after I changed some files and add and commit them I want to push them to server:But the error I get back is:Maybe you just need to commit. I ran into this when I did:Oops! Never committed!All I had to do was:Success!Try git show-ref to see what refs do you have. Is there refs/heads/master?You can try git push origin HEAD:master as more local-reference-independent solution.I also had a similar error after deleting all files in my local computer and I have to cleanup all files on the repository.My error message was something like this:and it solved by executing the following commands:That\'s it, hope this helps.So I tried Vi\'s solution:This worked for me.For me I had to make sure the public key is properly configured in the server (appended in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys) and in github/bitbucket (added to my SSH keys on github or bitbucket) - they need to match.Then:Worked for me in the end. Missing or skipping git add . or git commit may cause this error:To fix it, reinitialize and follow the proper sequence:To fix it, re-initialize and follow the proper code sequence:I found this happened in a brand new repository after I git added only a directory. As soon as I added a file (e.g. a README), git push worked great.This happens too when you are in a specific branch and try to push another branch that does not exist yet, like:git push -u origin master\nerror: src refspec master does not match any.For that you need to enter commit message as follow and then push the codegit commit -m "initial commit"git push origin masterSuccesfully pushed to masterThis just mean you forgot to do the initial commit, tryMy issue was that the \'master\' branch hadn\'t been created locally yet.A quick created the master branch, at which point, a quick:Pushed the work up to the git repo.I have same problem. I do it by following stepsHope it will help anyonegit add .is all you need that code track all untrack files in your dir This will also happen if you have a typo in the branch name you\'re trying to push.I had the same problem when I missed to run:(You must have at least one file, or you will get the error again)This happens when you have added your file, forgot to commit and pushing. \nSo commit the files and then push. You need to config your git if is the first time that you use it with:This worked for me resetting to remote master the repoI was forgot to do a "git pull origin master" after commit and before push and it cause the same problem: "src refspec master does not match any when pushing commits in git".\nSo, what you should to do is:I think its because you pushed an invalid branch. Generally because the repository does not have common master branch(maybe development branch). You can use\n    git branch\nto see branches.Another possible cause of this problem is if you misspell the branch name. So if you did what I did then the problem would be fixed by correcting:to I was getting this error because my local branchname did not match the new remote branch I was trying to create with git push origin <<branchname>>.In case if you are facing this problem even after doing git init and pushing your initial commit. You can the try the following,Your code will be pushed as new branch.If you want to create new branch remotely in the origin, you need to create the same branch locally first:I have the same issue, and fix mine in the following step : hope it helpsThis happened to me when I did not refer to the master branch of the origin. So, you can try the following:This creates a reference to the master branch of the origin in the local repository. Then you can push the local repository to the origin.I had a similar error. But git tells me:RunOr to set your account\'s default identity.Then the error goes away.Old topic, but I had this issue and wanted to share my experience.  I had already created a commit.  Make sure you are pushing to the right branchI was typing git push origin master but when I typed git branch I was on a v1 branch, so I had to type git push origin v1
