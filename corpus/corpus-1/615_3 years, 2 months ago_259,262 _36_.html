What is the difference between the COPY and ADD commands in a Dockerfile, and when would I use one over the other?The COPY instruction will copy new files from <src> and add them to\n  the container\'s filesystem at path <dest>The ADD instruction will copy new files from <src> and add them to the\n  container\'s filesystem at path <dest>.You should check the ADD and COPY documentation for an exhaustive description of their behaviours, but in a nutshell the major difference is that ADD can do more than COPY:Same as \'ADD\', but without the tar and remote URL handling.Reference straight from the source code.There is some official documentation on that point: Best Practices for Writing Dockerfiles Because image size matters, using ADD to fetch packages from remote URLs is strongly discouraged; you should use curl or wget instead. That way you can delete the files you no longer need after they\'ve been extracted and you won\'t have to add another layer in your image.For other items (files, directories) that do not require ADD\xe2\x80\x99s tar auto-extraction capability, you should always use COPY.From Docker docs:ADD or COPY Although ADD and COPY are functionally similar, generally speaking, COPY is preferred. That\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s more transparent than ADD. COPY only supports the basic copying of local files into the container, while ADD has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support) that are not immediately obvious. Consequently, the best use for ADD is local tar file auto-extraction into the image, as in ADD rootfs.tar.xz /.More: Best practices for writing DockerfilesIf you want to add a xx.tar.gz to a /usr/local in container, unzip it, and then remove the useless compressed package.For COPY:For ADD:ADD supports local-only tar extraction. Besides it, COPY will use three layers, but ADD only uses one layer.From Docker docs:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy"Although ADD and COPY are functionally similar, generally speaking, COPY is preferred.

This will ensure that each step\xe2\x80\x99s build cache is only invalidated (forcing the step to be re-run) if the specifically required files change.For example:Results in fewer cache invalidations for the RUN step, than if you put the COPY . /tmp/ before it.Because image size matters, using ADD to fetch packages from remote URLs is strongly discouraged; you should use curl or wget instead.

For example, you should avoid doing things like:And instead, do something like:For other items (files, directories) that do not require ADD\xe2\x80\x99s tar auto-extraction capability, you should always use COPY."COPY will work for most of the cases.ADD has all the capabilities of COPY and has the following additional features: Allows tar file auto-extraction in the image, for example, Allows files to be downloaded from a remote URL. However, the downloaded files will become part of the image. This causes the image size to bloat. So it\'s recommended to use cURL or Wget to download the archive explicitly, extract, and remove the archive.This is another way to copy files into an image. The -v option temporarily creates a volume that us used during the build process.  This is different that other volumes because it mounts a host directory for the build only.  Files can be copied using a standard cp command.  Also, like the curl and wget, it can be run in a command stack (runs in a single container) and not multiply the image size.  ADD and COPY are not stackable because they run in a standalone container and subsequent commands on those files that execute in additional containers will multiply the image size:With the options set thus:The following will execute in one container:I had to copy and untar java package in my docker image.\nWhen I compared the docker image size created using ADD it was 180MB bigger then the one created using COPY, tar -xzf *.tar.gz and rm *.tar.gzThis means that although ADD removes the tar file, it is still kept somewhere.\nAnd its making the image big!!
