I have a repo (origin) on a USB key that I cloned on my hard drive (local). I moved "origin" to a NAS and successfully tested cloning it from here.I would like to know if I can change the URI of "origin" in the settings of "local" so it will now pull from the NAS, and not from the USB key.For now, I can see two solutions:push everything to the usb-orign, and copy it to the NAS again (implies a lot of work due to new commits to nas-origin);add a new remote to "local" and delete the old one (I fear I\'ll break my history).You can(see git help remote) or you can just edit .git/config and change the URLs there. You\'re not in any danger of losing history unless you do something very silly (and if you\'re worried, just make a copy of your repo, since your repo is your history.)Changing a remote\'s URLChange Host for a Git Origin Serverfrom: http://pseudofish.com/blog/2010/06/28/change-host-for-a-git-origin-server/Hopefully this isn\xe2\x80\x99t something you need to do. The server that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using to collaborate on a few git projects with had the domain name expire. This meant finding a way of migrating the local repositories to get back in sync.Update: Thanks to @mawolf for pointing out there is an easy way with recent git versions (post Feb, 2010):See the man page for details.If you\xe2\x80\x99re on an older version, then try this:As a caveat, this works only as it is the same server, just with different names.Assuming that the new hostname is newhost.com, and the old one was oldhost.com, the change is quite simple.Edit the .git/config file in your working directory. You should see something like:Change oldhost.com to newhost.com, save the file and you\xe2\x80\x99re done.From my limited testing (git pull origin; git push origin; gitx) everything seems in order. And yes, I know it is bad form to mess with git internals.(alternatively, open .git/config, look for [remote "origin"], and edit the url = line.You can check it worked by examining the remotes:Next time you push, you\'ll have to specify the new upstream branch, e.g.:See also: GitHub: Changing a remote\'s URLgit remote set-url {name} {url}ex) git remote set-url origin https://github.com/myName/GitTest.gitIn the Git Bash, enter the command:git remote set-url origin https://NewRepoLink.gitEnter the CredentialsDoneif you cloned your local will automatically consist,remote URL where it gets  cloned.you can check  it using git remote -vif you want to made change in it,here,origin - your branch if you want to overwrite existing branch you can still use it.. it will override your existing ... it will do,for you...If you\'re using TortoiseGit then follow the below steps:Your branch and all your local commits will remain intact and you can keep working as you were before.
