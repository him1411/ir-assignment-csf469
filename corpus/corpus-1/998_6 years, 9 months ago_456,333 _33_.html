On Linux, I can use netstat -pntl | grep $PORT or fuser -n tcp $PORT to find out which process (PID) is listening on the specified TCP port. How do I get the same information on Mac OS X?Depending on your version of Mac OS X, use one of these:Substitute $PORT with the port number or a comma-separated list of port numbers.Prepend sudo (followed by a space) if you need information on ports below #1024.The -n flag is for displaying IP addresses instead of host names. This makes the command execute much faster, because DNS lookups to get the host names can be slow (several seconds or a minute for many hosts).See the comments for more options.You can also use: This works in Mavericks.For Yosemite (10.10) and El Capitan (10.11) and macOS Sierra (10.12):Update January 2016Really surprised no-one has suggested:to get the basic information required. For instance, checking on port 1337:Other variations, depending on circumstances:You can easily build on this to extract the PID itself. For example:which is also equivalent (in result) to this command:Quick illustration:For completeness, because frequently used together:To kill the PID:or as a one liner:This works in Mavericks (OSX 10.9.2).on OS X you can use the -v option for netstat to give the associated pid.type:the output will look like this:The PID is the number before the last column, 3105 for this caseOn Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.8), running \'man lsof\' yields:(actual manual entry is \'lsof -i 4 -a -p 1234\')The previous answers didn\'t work on Snow Leopard, but I was trying to use \'netstat -nlp\' until I saw the use of \'lsof\' in the answer by pts.This displays who\'s doing what. Remove -n to see hostnames (a bit slower).I am a Linux guy. In Linux it is extremely easy with netstat -ltpn or any combination of those letters. But in Mac OS X netstat -an | grep LISTEN is the most humane. Others are very ugly and very difficult to remember when troubleshooting.This did what I needed.I made a small script to see not only who is listening where but also to display established connections and to which countries. Works on OSX SieraThis may be useful to check if you are connected to north-korea! ;-)
