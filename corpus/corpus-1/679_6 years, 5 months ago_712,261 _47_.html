This question already has an answer here:What\'s the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN and FULL JOIN \nin MySQL?Reading this original article on The Code Project will help you a lot: Visual Representation of SQL Joins.Also check this post: SQL SERVER \xe2\x80\x93 Better Performance \xe2\x80\x93 LEFT JOIN or NOT IN?.Find original one at: Difference between JOIN and OUTER JOIN in MySQL.INNER JOIN gets all records that are common between both tablesLEFT JOIN gets all records from the LEFT linked table but if you have selected some columns from the RIGHT table, if there is no related records, these columns will contain NULLRIGHT JOIN is like the above but gets all records in the RIGHT tableFULL JOIN gets all records from both tables and puts NULL in the columns where related records do not exist in the opposite tableAn SQL JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables,\n  based on a common field between them.There are different types of joins available in SQL:INNER JOIN: returns rows when there is a match in both tables.LEFT JOIN: returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.RIGHT JOIN: returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table.FULL JOIN: returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.SELF JOIN: is used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.CARTESIAN JOIN: returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from the two or more joined tables.WE can take each first four joins in Details :We have two tables with the following values.TableATableB....................................................................INNER JOINNote :it gives the intersection of the two tables, i.e.  rows they have common in TableA and TableBSyntaxApply it in our sample table :Result Will Be LEFT JOINNote : will give all selected rows in TableA, plus any common selected rows in TableB.Syntax Apply it in our sample table :ResultRIGHT JOINNote : will give all selected rows in TableB, plus any common selected rows in TableA.Syntax Apply it in our sample table :Result FULL JOINNote : It is same as union operation, it will return all selected values from both tables.Syntax Apply it in our sample table :Result Interesting FactFor INNER joins the order doesn\'t matterFor (LEFT, RIGHT or FULL) OUTER joins,the order matterBetter to go check this Link it will give you interesting details about join order
