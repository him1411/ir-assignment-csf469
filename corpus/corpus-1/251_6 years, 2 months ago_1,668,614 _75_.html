I have this input element:Then I have some other elements, like other text inputs, textareas, etc.When the user clicks on that input with #subject, the page should scroll to the last element of the page with a nice animation. It should be a scroll to bottom and not to top.The last item of the page is a submit button with #submit:The animation should not be too fast and should be fluid.I am running the latest jQuery version. I prefer to not install any plugin but to use the default jQuery features to achieve this.Assuming you have a button with the id button, try this example:I got the code from the article Smoothly scroll to an element without a jQuery plugin. And I have tested it on the example below.  jQuery .scrollTo():  View - Demo, API, Source I wrote this lightweight plugin to make page/element scrolling much easier. It\'s flexible where you could pass in a target element or specified value. Perhaps this could be part of jQuery\'s next official release, what do you think?Examples Usage:Options:scrollTarget: A element, string, or number which indicates desired scroll position.offsetTop: A number that defines additional spacing above scroll target.duration: A string or number determining how long the animation will run.easing: A string indicating which easing function to use for the transition.complete: A function to call once the animation is complete.If you are not much interested in the smooth scroll effect and just interested in scrolling to a particular element, you don\'t require some jQuery function for this. Javascript has got your case covered:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.scrollIntoViewSo all you need to do is: $("selector").get(0).scrollIntoView(); .get(0) is used because we want to retrieve the JavaScript\'s DOM element and not the JQuery\'s DOM element.Check out the ScrollTo plugin. You can see the demo here.I hope it helps.Using this simple scriptWould make in sort that if a hash tag is found in the url, the scrollTo animate to the ID. If not hash tag found, then ignore the script.The solution by Steve and Peter works very well.But in some cases, you may have to convert the value to an integer. Strangely, the returned value from $("...").offset().top is sometimes in float.\nUse: parseInt($("....").offset().top)For example:A compact version of "animate" solution.Basic usage: $(\'#your_element\').scrollTo();If you are only handling scrolling to an input element, you can use focus().  For example, if you wanted to scroll to the first visible input:Or the first visible input in an container with class .error:Thanks to Tricia Ball for pointing this out!With this solution you do not need any plugin and there\'s no setup required besides placing the script before your closing </body> tag.On load, if there is a hash in the address, we scroll to it.And - whenever you click an a link with an href hash e.g. #top, we scroll to it.In most cases, it would be best to use a plugin. Seriously. I\'m going to tout mine here. Of course there are others, too. But please check if they really avoid the pitfalls for which you\'d want a plugin in the first place - not all of them do.I have written about the reasons for using a plugin elsewhere. In a nutshell, the one liner underpinning most answers here is bad UX.The animation doesn\'t respond to user actions. It carries on even if the user clicks, taps, or tries to scroll.If the starting point of the animation is close to the target element, the animation is painfully slow. If the target element is placed near the bottom of the page, it can\'t be scrolled to the top of the window. The scroll animation stops abruptly then, in mid motion.To handle these issues (and a bunch of others), you can use a plugin of mine, jQuery.scrollable. The call then becomesand that\'s it. Of course, there are more options.With regard to the target position, $target.offset().top does the job in most cases. But please be aware that the returned value doesn\'t take a border on the html element into account (see this demo). If you need the target position to be accurate under any circumstances, it is better to useThat works even if a border on the html element is set.This is my approach abstracting the ID\'s and href\'s, using a generic class selectorVery simple and easy to use jQuery custom plugin. Just set add attribut "scroll" to your clickable element and set it value to selector you want to scroll to. Like so: < a **scroll="#product"**>Click me < /a>. It can be used on any element. To show the full element (if it\'s possible with the current window size):I wrote a general purpose function that scrolls to either a jQuery object, a CSS selector, or a numeric value.Example usage:The function\'s code:When the user clicks on that input with #subject, the page should\n  scroll to the last element of the page with a nice animation. It\n  should be a scroll to bottom and not to top.The last item of the page is a submit button with #submitThis will first scroll down to #submit then restore the cursor back to the input that was clicked, which mimics a scroll down, and works on most browsers. It also doesn\'t require jQuery as it can be written in pure JavaScript.Can this fashion of using focus function mimic animation in a better way, through chaining focus calls. I haven\'t tested this theory, but it would look something like this:For what it\'s worth, this is how I managed to achieve such behavior for a general element which can be inside a DIV with scrolling. In our case we don\'t scroll the full body, but just particular elements with overflow: auto; within a larger layout.It creates a fake input of the height of the target element, and then puts a focus to it, and the browser will take care about the rest no matter how deep within the scrollable hierarchy you are. Works like a charm.$(\'html, body\').animate(...) does not for me on iphone, android chrome safari browser.  I had to target root content element of the page.$(\'#cotnent\').animate(...)Here is what I have ended up withAll body content wired up with a #content divAnimations:I set up a module scroll-element npm install scroll-element. It works like this:Written with help from the following SO posts:offset-top-of-an-element-without-jqueryscrolltop-animation-without-jqueryHere is the code:If you want to scroll within an overflow container (instead of $(\'html, body\') answered above), working also with absolute positioning, this is the way to do :
