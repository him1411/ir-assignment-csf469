Can someone provide a simple explanation of methods vs. functions in OOP context?A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:(this is a simplified explanation, ignoring issues of scope etc.)A method is on an object.\nA function is independent of an object. For Java, there are only methods.\nFor C, there are only functions.For C++ it would depend on whether or not you\'re in a class.\'method\' is the object-oriented word for \'function\'.  That\'s pretty much all there is to it (ie., no real difference).Unfortunately, I think a lot of the answers here are perpetuating or advancing the idea that there\'s some complex, meaningful difference.Really - there isn\'t all that much to it, just different words for the same thing.[late addition]In fact, as Brian Neal pointed out in a comment to this question, the C++ standard never uses the term \'method\' when refering to member functions. Some people may take that as an indication that C++ isn\'t really an object-oriented language; however, I prefer to take it as an indication that a pretty smart group of people didn\'t think there was a particularly strong reason to use a different term.In general: methods are functions that belong to a class, functions can be on any other scope of the code so you could state that all methods are functions, but not all functions are methods:Take the following python example:The example given shows you a class called "Door" which has a method or action called "open", it is called a method because it was declared inside a class. There is another portion of code with "def" just below which defines a function, it is a function because it is not declared inside a class, this function calls the method we defined inside our class as you can see and finally the function is being called by itself.As you can see you can call a function anywhere but if you want to call a method either you have to pass a new object of the same type as the class the method is declared (Class.method(object)) or you have to invoke the method inside the object (object.Method()), at least in python.Think of methods as things only one entity can do, so if you have a Dog class it would make sense to have a bark function only inside that class and that would be a method, if you have also a Person class it could make sense to write a function "feed" for that doesn\'t belong to any class since both humans and dogs can be fed and you could call that a function since it does not belong to any class in particular.A very general definition of the main difference between a Function and a Method:Functions are defined outside of classes, while Methods are defined inside of and part of classes.If you feel like reading here is "My introduction to OO methods"The idea behind Object Oriented paradigm is to "threat" the software is composed of .. well "objects". Objects in real world have properties, for instance if you have an Employee, the employee has a name, an employee id, a position, he belongs to a department etc. etc. The object also know how to deal with its attributes and perform some operations on them. Let say if we want to know what an employee is doing right now we would ask him.That "whatAreYouDoing" is a "message" sent to the object. The object knows how to answer to that questions, it is said it has a "method" to resolve the question.So, the way objects have to expose its behavior are called  methods. Methods thus are the artifact object have to "do" something. Other possible methods are etc.Functions in the other hand are ways a programming language has to compute some data, for instance you might have the function addValues( 8 , 8 ) that returns 16Since first popular programming languages ( such as fortran, c, pascal ) didn\'t cover the OO paradigm, they only call to these artifacts "functions".for instance the previous function in C would be:It is not "natural" to say an object has a "function" to perform some action, because functions are more related to mathematical stuff while an Employee has little mathematic on it, but you can have methods that do exactly the same as functions, for instance in Java this would be the equivalent addValues function.Looks familiar? That\xc2\xb4s because Java  have its roots on C++ and C++ on C.At the end is just a concept, in implementation they might look the same, but in the OO documentation these are called method.Here\xc2\xb4s an example of the previously Employee object in Java.The difference then, is on the "domain" where it is applied.AppleScript have the idea of "natural language" matphor , that at some point OO had. For instance Smalltalk. I hope it may be reasonable easier for you to understand methods in objects after reading  this.NOTE: The code is not to be compiled, just to serve as an example. Feel free to modify the post and add Python example.Let\'s say a function is a block of code (usually with its own scope, and sometimes with its own closure) that may receive some arguments and may also return a result.A method is a function that is owned by an object (in some object oriented systems, it is more correct to say it is owned by a class).  Being "owned" by a object/class means that you refer to the method through the object/class; for example, in Java if you want to invoke a method "open()" owned by an object "door" you need to write "door.open()".  Usually methods also gain some extra attributes describing their behaviour within the object/class, for example: visibility (related to the object oriented concept of encapsulation) which defines from which objects (or classes) the method can be invoked.In many object oriented languages, all "functions" belong to some object (or class) and so in these languages there are no functions that are not methods.In OO world, the two are commonly used to mean the same thing. From a pure Math and CS perspective, a function will always return the same result when called with the same arguments ( f(x,y) = (x + y) ).  A method on the other hand, is typically associated with an instance of a class.  Again though, most modern OO languages no longer use the term "function" for the most part.  Many static methods can be quite like functions, as they typically have no state (not always true).A function is a mathematical concept.  For example:says that function f() will return the sin of the first parameter added to the cosine of the second parameter.  It\'s just math.  As it happens sin() and cos() are also functions.  A function has another property: all calls to a function with the same parameters, should return the same result.A method, on the other hand, is a function that is related to an object in an object-oriented language.  It has one implicit parameter: the object being acted upon (and it\'s state).So, if you have an object Z with a method g(x), you might see the following:In this case, the parameter x is passed in, the same as in the function example earlier.  However, the parameter to cos() is a value that lives inside the object Z.  Z and the data that lives inside it (Z.y) are implicit parameters to Z\'s g() method.Function or a method is a named callable piece of code which performs some operations and optionally returns a value. In C language the term function is used. Java & C# people would say it a method (and a function in this case is defined within a class/object).A C++ programmer might call it a function or sometimes method (depending on if they are writing procedural style c++ code or are doing object oriented way of C++, also a C/C++ only programmer would likely call it a function because term \'method\' is less often used in C/C++ literature).You use a function by just calling it\'s name like,\nYou would call a method by referencing its object first like,Methods are functions of classes. In normal jargon, people interchange method and function all over. Basically you can think of them as the same thing (not sure if global functions are called methods).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_science)Function is a set of logic that can be used to manipulate data.While, Method is function that is used to manipulate the data of the object where it belongs.\nSo technically, if you have a function that is not completely related to your class but was declared in the class, its not a method; It\'s called a bad design.Methods on a class act on the instance of the class, called the object. In OO languages such as Object Pascal or C++, a "method" is a function associated with an object.  So, for example, a "Dog" object might have a "bark" function and this would be considered a "Method".  In contrast, the "StrLen" function stands alone (it provides the length of a string provided as an argument).  It is thus just a "function."  Javascript is technically Object Oriented as well but faces many limitations compared to a full-blown language like C++, C# or Pascal.  Nonetheless, the distinction should still hold.A couple of additional facts: C# is fully object oriented so you cannot create standalone "functions."  In C# every function is bound to an object and is thus, technically, a "method."  The kicker is that few people in C# refer to them as "methods" - they just use the term "functions" because there isn\'t any real distinction to be made.Finally - just so any Pascal gurus don\'t jump on me here - Pascal also differentiates between "functions" (which return a value) and "procedures" which do not.  C# does not make this distinction explicitly although you can, of course, choose to return a value or not.  Since you mentioned Python, the following might be a useful illustration of the relationship between methods and objects in most modern object-oriented languages.  In a nutshell what they call a "method" is just a function that gets passed an extra argument (as other answers have pointed out), but Python makes that more explicit than most languages.Now compare the function greet_with_greeter and the method greet: the only difference is the name of the first parameter (in the function I called it "greeter", in the method I called it "self").  So I can use the greet method in exactly the same way as I use the greet_with_greeter function (using the "dot" syntax to get at it, since I defined it inside a class):So I\'ve effectively turned a method into a function.  Can I turn a function into a method?  Well, as Python lets you mess with classes after they\'re defined, let\'s try:Yes, the function greet_with_greeter is now also known as the method greet2.  This shows the only real difference between a method and a function: when you call a method "on" an object by calling object.method(args), the language magically turns it into method(object, args).(OO purists might argue a method is something different from a function, and if you get into advanced Python or Ruby - or Smalltalk! - you will start to see their point.  Also some languages give methods special access to bits of an object.  But the main conceptual difference is still the hidden extra parameter.)Function is a set of logic that can be used to manipulate data. While, Method is function that is used to manipulate the data of the object where it belongs. So technically, if you have a function that is not completely related to your class but was declared in the class, its not a method; It\'s called a bad design.Historically, there may have been a subtle difference with a "method" being something which does not return a value, and a "function" one which does.Each language has its own lexicon of terms with special meaning. In "C", the word "function" means a program routine.In Java, the term "function" does not have any special meaning. Whereas "method" means one of the routines that forms the implementation of a class.In C# that would translate as:But really, I re-iterate that there is really no difference in the 2 concepts.\nIf you use the term "function" in informal discussions about Java, people will assume you meant "method" and carry on. Don\'t use it in proper documents or presentations about Java, or you will look silly.for me:\nthe function of a method and a function is the same if I agree that:Just like any piece of code you may have objects you put in and you may have an object that comes as a result. During doing that they might change the state of an object but that would not change their basic functioning for me.There might be a definition differencing in calling functions of objects or other codes. But isn\'t that something for a verbal differenciations and that\'s why people interchange them? The mentions example of computation I would be careful with. because I hire employes to do my calculations:By doing it that way I can rely on an employer being responsible for calculations. If he wants more money I free him and let the carbage collector\'s function of disposing unused employees do the rest and get a new employee.Even arguing that a method is an objects function and a function is unconnected computation will not help me. The function descriptor itself and ideally the function\'s documentation will tell me what it needs and what it may return. The rest, like manipulating some object\'s state is not really transparent to me. I do expect both functions and methods to deliver and manipulate what they claim to without needing to know in detail how they do it.\nEven a pure computational function might change the console\'s state or append to a logfile.From my understanding a method is any operation which can be performed on a class. It is a general term used in programming. In many languages methods are represented by functions and subroutines. The main distinction that most languages use for these is that functions may return a value back to the caller and a subroutine may not. However many modern languages only have functions, but these can optionally not return any value.For example, lets say you want to describe a cat and you would like that to be able to yawn. You would create a Cat class, with a Yawn method, which would most likely be a function without any return value.To a first order approximation, a method (in C++ style OO) is another word for a member function, that is a function that is part of a class.In languages like C/C++ you can have functions which are not members of a class; you don\'t call a function not associated with a class a method.IMHO people just wanted to invent new word for easier communication between programmers when they wanted to refer to functions inside objects. If you are saying methods you mean functions inside the class.\nIf you are saying functions you mean simply functions outside the class.The truth is that both words are used to describe functions. Even if you used it wrongly nothing wrong happens. Both words describe well what you want to achieve in your code.Function is a code that has to play a role (a function) of doing something.\nMethod is a method to resolve the problem.It does the same thing. It is the same thing. If you want to be super precise and go along with the convention you can call methods as the functions inside objects.Function is the concept mainly belonging to Procedure oriented programming where a function is an an entity which can process data and returns you valueMethod is the concept of Object Oriented programming where a method is a member of a class which mostly does processing on the class members.I am not an expert, but this is what I know:Function is C language term, it refers to a piece of code and the function name will be the identifier to use this function.Method is the OO term, typically it has a this pointer in the function parameter. You can not invoke this piece of code like C, you need to use object to invoke it.The invoke methods are also different. Here invoke meaning to find the address of this piece of code. C/C++, the linking time will use the function symbol to locate.Objecive-C is different. Invoke meaning a C function to use data structure to find the address. It means everything is known at run time.I know many others have already answered, but I found following is a simple, yet effective single line answer. Though it doesn\'t look a lot better than others answers here, but if you read it carefully, it has everything you need to know about the method vs function. A method is a function that has a defined receiver, in OOP terms, a method is a function on an instance of an object.Functions and methods are the same thingMember functions inside classes are called methods in some programming languages like Java.In C++, you can\'t differentiate between methods and functions. Most, if not all, C++ programmers don\'t use the name "method".Differentiating between "functions" and "methods" is as hard as differentiating between "functions" and "functions".Believe that "function" and "method" are only two different names of the same thing and you will be fine.In C++, sometimes, method is used to reflect the notion of member function of a class. However, recently I found a statement in the book \xc2\xabThe C++ Programming Language 4th Edition\xc2\xbb, on page 586 "Derived Classes"A virtual function is sometimes called a method.This is a little bit confusing, but he said sometimes, so it roughly makes sense, C++ creator tends to see methods as functions can be invoked on objects and can behave polymorphic.
