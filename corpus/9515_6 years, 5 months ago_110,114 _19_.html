Is there a way I can configure maven to always download sources and javadocs? Specifying -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true everytime (which usually goes along with running mvn compile twice because I forgot the first time) becomes rather tedious.Open your settings.xml file ~/.m2/settings.xml  (create it if it doesn\'t exist). Add a section with the properties added. Then make sure the activeProfiles includes the new profile.In my case the "settings.xml" solution didn\'t work so I use this command in order to download all the sources:You also can use it with other maven commands, for example:To download all documentation, use the following command:Answer for people from GoogleIn Eclipse you can automatically download javadoc and sources.To do that, right click on the project and useI am using Maven 3.3.3 and cannot get the default profile to work in a user or global settings.xml file.As a workaround, you may also add an additional build plugin to your pom.xml file.Just consolidating and prepared the single command to address source and docs download...mvn dependency:sources dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadocAs @xecaps12 said, the simplest/efficient approach is to change your Maven settings file (~/.m2/settings.xml) but if it is a default settings for you, you can also set it like that I think it can be done per plugin. See this chapter from the Maven book.You might be able to configure the dependency plugin to download sources (even though I haven\'t tried it myself :-).On NetBeans : \nopen your project explorer->Dependencies->[file.jar] rightclick->Download JavadocNot sure, but you should be able to do something by setting a default active profile in your settings.xmlSeeSee http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html
