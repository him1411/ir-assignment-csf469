Let\'s say I have defined a function abc() that will handle all the logic related to analising the arguments passed to my script.How can I pass all arguments my bash script has received to it? The number of params is variable, so I can\'t just hardcode the arguments passed like this:edit: Better yet, is there any way for my function to have access to the script arguments\' variables?Pet peeve: when using $@, you should (almost) always put it in double-quotes to avoid misparsing of argument with spaces in them:I needed a variation on this, which I expect will be useful to others:The "${@:3}" part means all the members of the array starting at 3.  So this function implements a sorted diff by passing the first two arguments to diff through sort and then passing all other arguments to diff, so you can call it similarly to diff:Use the $@ variable, which expands to all command-line parameters separated by spaces.Here\'s a simple script:$# is the number of arguments received by the script. I find easier to access them using an array: the args=("$@") line puts all the arguments in the args array. To access them use ${args[index]}.It\'s worth mentioning that you can specify argument ranges with this syntax.I hadn\'t seen it mentioned.$@ represents all the parameters given to your bash script.
