If a dict is not empty, I access an arbitrary element as:Is there any better way to do this?Non-destructively you can:On Python 3 this becomesIf you want it to work in both Python 2 & 3, you can use the six library:though at this point it is quite cryptic and I\'d rather prefer your code.If you want to remove any item, do:Note that "first" is not an appropriate term here.  This is "any" item, because dict is not an ordered type.If you only need to access one element (being the first by chance, since dicts do not guarantee ordering) you can simply do this in Python 2:Please note that (at best of my knowledge) Python does not guarantee that 2 successive calls to any of these methods will return list with the same ordering. This is not supported with Python3.In python3, The way :return a value in type : dict_keys(), we\'ll got an error when got 1st member of keys of dict by this way:Finally, I convert dict.keys() to list @1st, and got 1st member by list splice method:As others mentioned, there is no "first item", since dictionaries have no guaranteed order (they\'re implemented as hash tables).  If you want, for example, the value corresponding to the smallest key, thedict[min(thedict)] will do that.  If you care about the order in which the keys were inserted, i.e., by "first" you mean "inserted earliest", then in Python 3.1 you can use collections.OrderedDict, which is also in the forthcoming Python 2.7; for older versions of Python, download, install, and use the ordered dict backport (2.4 and later) which you can find here.Ignoring issues surrounding dict ordering, this might be better:This way we avoid item lookup and generating a list of keys that we don\'t use.a[list(a)[0]] # the first element is hereshort, Python 2 and Python 3 valid code:You can always do:This will give you a consistently sorted (with respect to builtin.hash() I guess) set of keys you can process on if the sorting has any meaning to you. That means for example numeric types are sorted consistently even if you expand the dictionary.EXAMPLENote that the dictionary is sorted when printed. But the key set is essentially a hashmap!In python3 For both Python 2 and 3:
