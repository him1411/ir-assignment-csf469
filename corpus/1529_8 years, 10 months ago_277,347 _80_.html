What\'s the difference between <b> and <strong>, <i> and <em> in HTML/XHTML? When should you use each?They have the same effect on normal web browser rendering engines, but there is a fundamental difference between them.As the author writes in a discussion list post:Think of three different situations:"Bold" is a style - when you say "bold a word", people basically know that \nit means to add more, let\'s say "ink", around the letters until they stand out \nmore amongst the rest of the letters.That, unfortunately, means nothing to a blind person. On mobile phones\nand other PDAs, text is already bold because screen resolution is very small. You can\'t bold a bold without screwing something up.<b> is a style - we know what "bold" is supposed to look like.<strong> however is an indication of how something should be understood. "Strong" could (and often does) mean "bold" in a browser, but it could also mean a lower tone for a speaking program like Jaws (for blind people) or be represented by an underline (since you can\'t bold a bold) on a Palm Pilot.HTML was never meant to be about styles. Do some searches for "Tim Berners-Lee" and "the semantic web." <strong> is semantic—it describes the text it surrounds (e.g., "this text should be stronger than the rest of the text you\'ve displayed") as opposed to describing how the text it surrounds should be displayed (e.g., "this text should be bold").<b> and <i> are explicit - they specify bold and italic respectively.<strong> and <em> are semantic - they specify that the enclosed text should be "strong" or "emphasised" in some way, usually bold and italic, but allow for the actual styling to be controlled via CSS.  Hence these are preferred in modern web pages.<strong> and <em> add extra semantic meaning to your document. It just so happens that they also give a bold and italic style to your text.You could of course override their styling with CSS.<b> and <i> on the other hand only apply font styling and should no longer be used. (Because you\'re supposed to format with CSS, and if the text was actually important then you would probably make it "strong" or "emphasised" anyway!)Hope that makes sense.<b> and <i> are both related to style, whereas <em> and <strong> are semantic. In HTML 4, the first are classified as font style elements, and the latter as phrase elements.As you indicated correctly, <i> and <em> are often considered similar, because browsers often render both in italics. But according to the specifications, <em> indicates emphasis and <strong> indicates stronger emphasis, which is quite clear, but often misinterpreted. On the other hand, the distinction between when to use <i> or <b> is really a matter of style.While <strong> and <em> are of course more semantically correct, there seem definite legitimate reasons to use the <b> and <i> tags for customer-written content. In such content, words or phrases may be bolded or italicized and it is generally  not up to us to analyze the semantic reasoning for such bolding or italicizing. Further, such content may refer to bolded and italicized words and phrases to convey a specific meaning. An example would be an english exam question which instructs a student to replace the bolded word.Here\'s a summary of definitions together with suggested usage:<b> ...a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate voice or mood, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, actionable words in interactive text-driven software, or an article lede.<strong> ...now represents importance rather than strong emphasis.<i> ...a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a manner indicating a different quality of text, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought, or a ship name in Western texts.<em> ...indicates emphasis.(These are all direct quotes from W3C sources, with my emphasis added. See: https://rawgithub.com/whatwg/html-differences/master/Overview.html#changed-elements and http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#h-9.2.1 for the originals)As others have said <b> and <i> are explicit (i.e. "make this text bold"), whereas <strong> and <em> are semantic (i.e. "this text should be emphasised").In the context of a modern web-browser, it\'s difficult to see the difference (they both appear to produce the same result, right?), but think about screen readers for the visually impaired. If a screen-reader came across an <i> tag, it wouldn\'t know what to do. But if it comes across a <em> tag, it knows that whatever is within should be emphasised to the listener. And therein you get the practical difference.As the others have stated, the difference is that <b> and <i> hardcode font styles, whereas <strong> and <em> dictate semantic meaning, with the font style (or speaking browser intonation, or what-have-you) to be determined at the time the text is rendered (or spoken).You can think of this as a difference between a “physical” font style and a “logical” style, if you will.  At some later time, you may wish to change the way <strong> and <em> text are displayed, say, by altering properties in a style sheet to add color and size changes, or even to use different font faces entirely.  If you\'ve used “logical” markup instead of hardcoded “physical” markup, then you can simply change the display properties in one place each in your style sheet, and then all of the pages that reference that style sheet get changed automatically, without ever having to edit them.Pretty slick, huh?This is also the rationale behind defining sub-styles (referenced using the style= property in text tags) for paragraphs, table cells, header text, captions, etc., and using <div> tags.  You can define physical representation for your logical styles in the style sheet, and the changes are automatically reflected in the web pages that reference that style sheet.  Want a different representation for source code?  Redefine the font, size, weight, spacing, etc. for your "code" style.If you use XHTML, you can even define your own semantic tags, and your style sheet would do the conversions to physical font styles and layouts for you.<b> and <i> should be avoided because they describe the style of the text. Instead, use <strong> and <em> because that describes the semantics (the meaning) of the text.As with all things in HTML, you should be thinking not about how you want it to look, but what you actually mean. Sure, it might just be bold and italics to you, but not to a screen reader.Use them only if using CSS style classes is for any reason unconvinient or impossible (like blog systems, allow only some tags to use in posts and eventually embedded styles). Another reason is support for very old browsers (some mobile devices?) or primitive search engines (that give points for <b> or <strong> tags, instead of analysing CSS styles).If you can define CSS styles, use them.<em> and <strong> consume more bandwidth than <i> and <b>.They also require more typing (if not auto-generated).They also clutter the editor screen with more text. I seem to recall that programmers like smaller source files if they are the same. (And let\'s be real, they are the same. Yes, there are "technical" (<i>cough</i>, ahem, excuse me) differences, but that\'s mostly phony to begin with.)With any of the above tags, you can use style sheets to customize how they appear to however you want if you need them to appear different than their defaults renderings.HTML Formatting Elements:HTML also defines special elements for defining text with a special meaning.\nHTML uses elements like  and  for formatting output, like bold or italic text.HTML Bold and Strong Formatting:The HTML  element defines bold text, without any extra importance.The HTML  element defines strong text, with added semantic\n  "strong" importance.HTML Italic and Emphasized Formatting:The HTML  element defines italic text, without any extra\n  importance.The HTML  element defines emphasized text, with added semantic\n  importance.b or i means you want the text to be rendered as bold or italics. strong or em means you want the text to be rendered in a way that the user understands as "important". The default is to render strong as bold and em as italics, but some other cultures might use a different mapping.Like strings in a program, b and i would be "hard coded" while strong and em would be "localized"."They have the same effect. However, XHTML, a cleaner, newer version of HTML, recommends the use of the <strong> tag. Strong is better because it is easier to read - its meaning is clearer. Additionally, <strong> conveys a meaning - showing the text strongly - while <b> (for bold) conveys a method - bolding the text. With strong, your code still makes sense if you use CSS stylesheets to change what the methods of making the text strong is.The same goes for the difference between <i> and <em> ".Google dixit:http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_difference_between_HTML_tags_b_and_strongI use both <strong> and <b>, actually, for exactly the reasons mentioned in this thread of responses. There are times when bold-facing some text simply looks better, but it isn\'t,  necessarily, semantically more important than the rest of the sentence. Here\'s an example from a page I\'m working on right now:"Retrieves <strong>all</strong> books about <b>lacrosse</b>."In that sentence, the word "all" is very important, and "lacrosse" less so--I merely wanted it bold because it represents a search term, so I wanted some visual separation. If you\'re viewing the page with a screen reader, I really don\'t think it needs to go out of the way to emphasize the word "lacrosse".I would tend to imagine that most web developers use one of the other, but both are fine--<b> is most definitely not deprecated, as some people have claimed. For me, it\'s just a fine line between visual appeal and meaning.You should try to avoid <b> and <i>. They were introduced for "layouting" the page (like the meanwhile removed font tag) and layout is nothing that should be done in HTML, it should be done in CSS (HTM == Structure, CSS == Layout). These tags may as well vanish in the future, after all you can just use CSS and span tags to make text bold/italic.<em> and <strong> on the other hand only says that something is "emphasized" or "strongly emphasized", it leaves it completely open to the brother how to render it. Most browsers will render em italic and strong bold, but they are not forced to do that (they may use different colors, font sizes, fonts, whatever). You can use CSS to change the behavior the way you desire. You can make em bold if you like and strong bold and red for example.i,b,em and strong tags are traditionally representational. But they have been given new semantic meaning in html5. i and b was used for font style in html4. i was used for italic and b for bold. In html5. i tag has new semantic meaning of \'alternate voice or mood\' and b tag has the meaning of stylistically offset. Example uses of i tag are - taxonomic designation, technical term, idiomatic phrase from another language, transliteration, a thought, ship names in western texts. Such as -Example uses of b tag are keywords in a document extract, product names in a review, actionable words in an interactive text driven software, article lead.The following example paragraph is stylistically offset from the paragraphs that follow it.em and strong had the meaning of emphasis and strong emphasis in html4. But in html5 em means stressed emphasis and strong means strong importance.In the following example there should be a linguistic change while reading the word before ...In the same example we can use the strong tag as follows ..to give importance on the event date.MDN Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong<strong> and <em> are abstract (which is what people mean when they say it\'s semantic).\n<b> and <i> are specific ways of making something "strong" or "emphasized"<strong> : <b> :: vehicle :: jeepWe use the <strong> tag for text which has high priority for SEO purposes like product name, company name etc, while <b> simple makes it bold.Similarly, we use <em> for text which has high priority for SEO, while <i> to make the text simply italic.
