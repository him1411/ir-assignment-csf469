I\'m using Notepad++ and I can\'t figure this out :I have numerous lines all starting with http. I need to add some text in front of it in every line.  Also, I need to add different text to the end of each line. Each line ends differently.What is the fastest way to add text to the start and end of each line?STEP 1. Press CTRL-H to bring up the Find/Replace Dialog.  STEP 2. Choose the "Regular expressions" checkbox near the bottom of the dialog.STEP 3.a To add "test" to the beginning of each line, STEP 3.b This allows you to type on every line simultaneously.I found the solution above here.I think this is much easier than using regex.Notepad++ has a very powerful editing capability.\n(Today I\'m searching for the similar function in Sublime Text), but for Notepad++, just hold Alt when you drag the mouse. What you type will then replace the selected column on every line. To insert without replacing existing text, use Alt-Shift.Press Ctrl+H\nSelect Regular ExpressionTry this to place any character on the beginning of each lineFind what: ^() or just this ^Replace with: any character you want to place.Try this to place any character on the end of each lineFind what: ()$  or just this $Replace with: any character you want to place.You can automatically do it in Notepad++ (add text at the beginning and/or end of each line) by using one regular expression in Replace (Ctrl+H):Explanation: Expression $1 in Replace with input denotes all the characters that include the round brackets (.*) in Find what regular expressin.Tested, it works.Hope that helps.Open Notepad++, then click Ctrl+ F. Choose Regular Expression*Find What: "^" (which represents index of the each line).Replace with : "anyText"*Well, I am posting this after such a long time but this will the easiest of all.To add text at the beginning/a-certain-place-from-start for all lines, just click there and do ALT+C and you will get the below box. Type in your text and click OK and it\'s done.To add a certain text at end of all lines, do CTRL+F, and choose REPLACE. You will get the below box. Put in \'$\' in \'find what\' and in \'replace with\' type in your text.Make sure you choose \'regular expression\' in the search mode (left down). Finally click \'replace all\' and you are done. Simply in the "Find what:" field, type \\r. This means "Ends of the Row". In the "Replace with:" field, you put what you want for instance .xmlif you have several lines, and you are aiming to add that text to the end of the each line, you need to markup the option ". matches newline" in the "Search Mode" group box.Example:You have a file name list, but you want to add an extension like .xml. \nThis would be what you need to do and Bang!
