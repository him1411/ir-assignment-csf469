I have a SVG file which has a defined size of 16x16. When I use Image Magick\'s convert program to convert it into a PNG then I get a 16x16 pixel PNG which is way too small:I need to specify the pixel size of the output PNG. -size parameter seems to be ignored, -scale parameter scales the PNG after it has been converted to PNG. The best result up to now I got by using the -density parameter:But I\'m not satisfied because I want to specify the output size in pixels without doing math to calculate the density value. So I want to do something like this:So what is the magic parameter I have to use here? I haven\'t been able to get good results from ImageMagick in this instance, but Inkscape does a nice job of it on Linux and Windows:Here\'s the result of scaling a 16x16 SVG to a 200x200 PNG using this command:Just for reference, my Inkscape version (on Ubuntu 12.04) is:and on Windows 7, it is:Try svgexport:svgexport is a simple cross-platform command line tool that I have made for exporting svg files to jpg and png, see here for more options. To install svgexport install npm, then run:Edit: If you find an issue with the library, please submit it on GitHub, thanks!This is not perfect but it does the job.Basically it increases the DPI high enough (just use an educated/safe guess) that resizing is done with adequate quality. I was trying to find a proper solution to this but after a while decided this was good enough for my current need.Note: Use 200x200! to force the given resolutionIf you are on MacOS X and having problems with Imagemagick\'s convert, you might try reinstalling it with RSVG lib.\nUsing HomeBrew:Verify that it\'s delegating correctly:It should display rsvg.Inkscape doesn\'t seem to work when svg units are not px (e.g. cm).  I got a blank image.  Maybe, it could be fixed by twiddling the dpi, but it was too troublesome.Svgexport is a node.js program and so not generally useful.Imagemagick\'s convert works ok with:If you use -resize, the image is fuzzy and the file is much larger.BESTIt is fastest, has the fewest dependencies, and the output is about 30% smaller than convert.  Install librsvg2-bin to get it. There does not appear to be a man page but you can type:to get some assistance.  Simple is good.In order to rescale the image, the option -density should be used. As far as I know the standard density is 72 and maps the size 1:1. If you want the output png to be as double as big as the original svg set density to 72*2=144convert -density 144 source.svg target.pngwhy don\'t you give a try to inkscape command line, this is my bat file to convert all svg in this dir to png:FOR %%x IN (*.svg)  DO   C:\\Ink\\App\\Inkscape\\inkscape.exe  %%x  -z --export-dpi=500 --export-area-drawing --export-png="%%~nx.png" After following the steps in Jose Alban\'s answer, I was able to get ImageMagick to work just fine using the following command: The number 1536 comes from a ballpark estimate of density, see this answer for more information.I came to this post - but I just wanted to do the conversion by batch and quick without the usage of any parameters (due to several files with different sizes). For me the requirements were probably a bit easier than for the original author. (Wanted to use SVGs in MS PowerPoint, but it doesn\'t allow)I\'ve solved this issue through changing the width and height attributes of the <svg> tag to match my intended output size and then converting it using ImageMagick. Works like a charm.Here\'s my Python code, a function that will return the JPG file\'s content:The top answer by @808sound did not work for me. I wanted to resize\nand got\nSo instead I opened up Inkscape, then went to File, Export as PNG fileand a GUI box popped up that allowed me to set the exact dimensions I needed.Version on Ubuntu 16.04 Linux: \nInkscape 0.91 (September 2016)(This image is from Kenney.nl\'s asset packs by the way)
