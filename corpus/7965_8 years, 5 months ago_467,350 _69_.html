Can I disable right click on my web page without using JavaScript? I ask this because most browsers allow user to disable JavaScript.If not, how do I use JavaScript to disable right click?You can do that with JavaScript by adding an event listener for the "contextmenu" event and calling the preventDefault() method:That being said: DON\'T DO IT.Why? Because it achieves nothing other than annoying users. Also many browsers have a security option to disallow disabling of the right click (context) menu anyway.Not sure why you\'d want to. If it\'s out of some misplaced belief that you can protect your source code or images that way, think again: you can\'t.DON\'TJust, don\'t.No matter what you do, you can\'t prevent users from having full access to every bit of data on your website. Any Javascript you code can be rendered moot by simply turning off Javascript on the browser (or using a plugin like NoScript). Additionally, there\'s no way to disable the ability of any user to simply "view source" or "view page info" (or use wget) for your site.It\'s not worth the effort. It won\'t actually work. It will make your site actively hostile to users. They will notice this and stop visiting. There is no benefit to doing this, only wasted effort and lost traffic.Don\'t.Update: It seems this little topic has proven quite controversial over time. Even so, I stand by this answer to this question. Sometimes the correct answer is advice instead of a literal response.People who stumble on this question in hopes of finding out how to create custom context menus should look elsewhere, such as these questions:The original question was about how to stop right-click given that the user can disable JavaScript: which sound nefarious and evil (hence the negative responses) - but all duplicates redirect here, even though many of the duplicates are asking for less evil purposes.Like using the right-click button in HTML5 games, for example. This can be done with the inline code above, or a bit nicer is something like this:But if you are making a game, then remember that the right-click button fires the contextmenu event - but it also fires the regular mousedown and mouseup events too. So you need to check the event\'s which property to see if it was the left (which === 1), middle (which === 2), or right (which === 3) mouse button that is firing the event.Here\'s an example in jQuery - note that the pressing the right mouse button will fire three events: the mousedown event, the contextmenu event, and the mouseup event.So if you\'re using the left and right mouse buttons in a game, you\'ll have to do some conditional logic in the mouse handlers.If you are a jquery fan,use thisIf your aim is to prevent people being able to download your images, as most people have said, disabling right click is pretty much ineffective.Assuming you are trying to protect images the alternative methods are -Using a flash player, users can\'t download them as such, but they could easily do a screen capture.If you want to be more akward, make the image the background of a div, containing a transparent image, \xc3\xa0 la -will be enough to deter the casual theft of your images (see below for a sample), but as with all these techniques, is trivial to defeat with a basic understanding of html.If you don\'t care about alerting the user with a message every time they try to right click, try adding this to your body tagThis will block all access to the context menu (not just from the right mouse button but from the keyboard as well). However, as mentioned in the other answers, there really is no point adding a right click disabler. Anyone with basic browser knowledge can view the source and extract the information they need.First, you cannot achieve this without using a client side capability. This is where the javascript runs. Secondly, if you are trying to control what an end user can consume from your site, then you need to rethink how you display that information. An image has a public url that can be fetched via HTTP without the need for a browser.Authentication can control who has access to what resources. Embedded watermarking in images can prove that the image was from a specific person/company.At the end of the day, resource management is really user/guest managment.The first rule of the Internet, if you dont want it taken, dont make it public! The second rule of the Internet, if you dont want it taken, dont put it on the Internet!You cannot accomplish what you\'re asking without using Javascript. Any other technology you may choose to use can only help to compose the web page on the server side to be sent to the browser.There simply is no good solution, and there is no solution period without Javascript.If your goal is to disallow users to simply save your images, you can also check if the clicked target is an image, only disable right click in that case. So right click can be used for other purposes. Taken from the code above:This is just to take away the easiest way of saving your images, but it can still be done.Do it like below (It works on firefox too): Put this code into your <head> tag of your page.This will disable right click on your whole web page, but only when JavaScript is enabled.Of course, as per all other comments here, this simply doesn\'t work.I did once construct a simple java applet for a client which forced any capture of of an image to be done via screen capture and you might like to consider a similar technique.  It worked, within the limitations, but I still think it was a waste of time.Try ThisI know I am late, but I want to create some assumptions and explainations for the answer I am going to provide.Can I disable right click on my web page without using Javascript?Yes, by using JavaScript you can disable any event that happens and you can do that mostly only by javaScript. How, all you need is:A working hardwareA website or somewhere from which you can learn about the keycodes. Because you\'re gonna need them.Now lets say you wanna block the enter key press here is the code: For the right click use this: in the place of event.keyCode. And you\'ll block it. I want to ask this because most browsers allow users to disable it by Javascript.You\'re right, browsers allow you to use JavaScript and javascript does the whole job for you. You donot need to setup anything, just need the script attribute in the head. The main and the fast answer to that would be, users won\'t like it. Everyone needs freedom, no-one I mean no-one wants to be blocked or disabled, a few minutes ago I was at a site, which had blocked me from right clicking and I felt why? Do you need to secure your source code? Then here ctrl+shift+J I have opened the Console and now I can go to HTML-code tab. Go ahead and stop me. This won\'t add any of the security layer to your app.There are alot of userful menus in the Right Click, like Copy, Paste, Search Google for \'text\' (In Chrome) and many more. So user would like to get ease of access instead of remembering alot of keyboard shortcuts. Anyone can still copy the context, save the image or do whatever he wants. Browsers use Mouse Navigation: Some browsers such as Opera uses mouse navigation, so if you disable it, user would definitely hate your User Interface and the scripts.So that was the basic, I was going to write some more about saving the source code hehehe but, let it be the answer to your question.Key and mouse button code:http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_button.asphttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.button (would be appreciated by the users too).Why not to disable right click:http://www.sitepoint.com/dont-disable-right-click/If you are using jquery, you can try this code:Check this out: http://www.landcoder.com/4-dynamic-interactive-code-snippets-jquery-705#disablerightclickJavascript:Disable  right click in site :or next method is :
