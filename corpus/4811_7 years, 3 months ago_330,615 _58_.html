I have two divs side by side. I\'d like the height of them to be the same, and stay the same if one of them resizes. I can\'t figure this one out though. Ideas?To clarify my confusing question, I\'d like both boxes to always be the same size, so if one grows because text is placed into it, the other one should grow to match the height.With flexbox it\'s a single declaration:Prefixes may be required for older browsers, see browser support.This is a common problem which many have encountered, but luckily some smart minds like Ed Eliot\'s on his blog have posted their solutions online.Basically what you do is make both divs/columns very tall by adding a padding-bottom: 100% and then "trick the browser" into thinking they aren\'t that tall using margin-bottom: -100%. It is better explained by Ed Eliot on his blog, which also includes many examples.This is an area where CSS has never really had any solutions \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99re down to using <table> tags (or faking them using the CSS display:table* values), as that\xe2\x80\x99s the only place where a \xe2\x80\x9ckeep a bunch of elements the same height\xe2\x80\x9d was implemented.This works in all versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari, Opera from at least version 8, and in IE from version 8.using jQuery you can do it in a super simple one-line-script.This is a bit more interesting.  The technique is called Faux Columns.  More or less you don\'t actually set the actual height to be the same, but you rig up some graphical elements so they look the same height.I\'m surprised that nobody has mentioned the (very old but reliable) Absolute Columns technique:\nhttp://24ways.org/2008/absolute-columns/In my opinion, it is far superior to both Faux Columns and One True Layout\'s technique.The general idea is that an element with position: absolute; will position against the nearest parent element that has position: relative;. You then stretch a column to fill 100% height by assigning both a top: 0px; and bottom: 0px; (or whatever pixels/percentages you actually need.) Here\'s an example:You can use Jquery\'s Equal Heights Plugin to accomplish, this plugins makes all the div of exact same height as other. If one of them grows and other will also grow.Here a sample of implementationHere is the linkhttp://www.cssnewbie.com/equalheights-jquery-plugin/ You could use Faux Columns. Basically it uses a background image in a containing DIV to simulate the two equal-height-DIVs. Using this technique also allowes you to add shadows, rounded corners, custom borders or other funky patterns to your containers.Only works with fixed-width boxes though.Well tested out and properly working in every browser.Just spotted this thread while searching for this very answer. I just made a small jQuery function, hope this helps, works like a charm:JAVASCRIPTHTMLIf you don\'t mind one of the divs being a master and dictating the height for both divs there is this:FiddleNo matter what, the div on the right will expand or squish&overflow to match the height of the div on the left.Both divs must be immediate children of a container, and have to specify their widths within it.Relevant CSS:I like to use pseudo elements to achieve this. You can use it as background of the content and let them fill the space.With these approach you can set margins between columns, borders, etc.you can use jQuery to achieve this easily.CSSjQueryHTMLYou\'ll need to include jQueryI know its been a long time but I share my solution anyway.\nThis is a jQuery trick.--- HTML ---- CSS--- JQUERYThe FiddleHTMLCSSThis is a jQuery plugin which sets the equal height for all elements on the same row(by checking the element\'s offset.top). So if your jQuery array contains elements from more than one row(different offset.top), each row will have a separated height, based on element with maximum height on that row.};This question was asked 6 years ago, but it\'s still worthy to give a simple answer with flexbox layout nowadays.Just add the following CSS to the father <div>, it will work.The first two lines declare it will be displayed as flexbox. And flex-direction: row tells browsers that its children will be display in columns. And align-items: stretch will meet the requirement that all the children elements will stretch to the same height it one of them become higher.I was having the same problem so i created this small function using jquery as jquery is part of every web application nowadays.You can call this function on page ready eventI hope this works for you.I recently came across this and didn\'t really like the solutions so I tried experimenting..mydivclass {inline-block; vertical-align: middle; width: 33%;}What I did here is to change the height to min-height and gave it a fixed value. if one of them is getting resized the other one will stay the same height. not sure if this is what you want
