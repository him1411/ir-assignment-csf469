I\'m using asp.net mvc 4 webapi beta to build a rest service.  I need to be able to accept POSTed images/files from client applications.  Is this possible using the webapi?  Below is how action I am currently using.  Does anyone know of an example how this should work?see http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/working-with-http/sending-html-form-data,-part-2, although I think the article makes it seem a bit more complicated than it really is.Basically, I\'m surprised that a lot of you seem to want to save files on the server. Solution to keep everything in memory is as follows:See the code below, adapted from this article, which demonstrates the simplest example code I could find.  It includes both file and memory (faster) uploads.Here is a quick and dirty solution which takes uploaded file contents from the HTTP body and writes it to a file. I included a "bare bones" HTML/JS snippet for the file upload.Web API Method:HTML File Upload:I used Mike Wasson\'s answer before I updated all the NuGets in my webapi mvc4 project.  Once I did, I had to re-write the file upload action:Apparently BodyPartFileNames is no longer available within the MultipartFormDataStreamProvider.Toward this same directions, I\'m posting a client and server snipets that send Excel Files using WebApi, c# 4:And the server webapi controller:And the Custom MyMultipartFormDataStreamProvider, needed to customize the Filename:\n\nPS: I took this code from another post http://www.codeguru.com/csharp/.net/uploading-files-asynchronously-using-asp.net-web-api.htmI had a similar problem for the preview Web API. Did not port that part to the new MVC 4 Web API yet, but maybe this helps:REST file upload with HttpRequestMessage or Stream?Please let me know, can sit down tomorrow and try to implement it again.
