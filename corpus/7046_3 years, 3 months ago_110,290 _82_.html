What is the difference between let and var in Apple\'s Swift language?In my understanding, it is a compiled language but it does not check the type at compile time. It makes me confused. How does the compiler know about the type error? If the compiler doesn\'t check the type, isn\'t it a problem with production environment?The let keyword defines a constant:The theAnswer cannot be changed afterwards.  This is why anything weak can\'t be written using let. They need to change during runtime and you must be using var instead.The var defines an ordinary variable.What is interesting:The value of a constant doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be known at compile time, but you must assign the value exactly once.Another strange feature:You can use almost any character you like for constant and variable\n  names, including Unicode characters:Excerpts From: Apple Inc. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Swift Programming Language.\xe2\x80\x9d iBooks. https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=881256329Because comments asking for adding other facts to the answer, converting this to community wiki answer. Feel free edit the answer to make it better.According to The Swift Programming Language BookLike C, Swift uses variables to store and refer to values by an\n  identifying name. Swift also makes extensive use of variables whose\n  values cannot be changed. These are known as constants, and are much\n  more powerful than constants in C.Both var and let are references, therefore let is a const reference.\nUsing fundamental types doesn\'t really show how let is different than const.\nThe difference comes when using it with class instances (reference types):let is used to define constants and var to define variables.TheDeclaring Constants and Variables section of The Swift Programming Language documentation specifies the following:You declare constants with the let keyword and variables with the var keyword.Make sure to understand how this works for Reference types.  Unlike Value Types, the object\'s underlying properties can change despite an instance of a reference type being declared as a constant.  See the Classes are Reference Types section of the documentation, and look at the example where they change the frameRate property.It\'s maybe better to state this difference by the Mutability / Unmutability notion that is the correct paradigm of values and instances changeability in Objects space which is larger than the only "constant / variable" usual notions.\nAnd furthermore this is closer to Objective C approach.define a value and an instance UNMUTABLEdefine changeable / MUTABLE value and instanceVery simple:Bit of description:let creates a constant. (sort of like an NSString). You can\'t change its value once you have set it. You can still add it to other things and create new variables though.var creates a variable. (sort of like NSMutableString) so you can change the value of it. But this has been answered several times.let defines a "constant". Its value is set once and only once, though not necessarily when you declare it. For example, you use let to define a property in a class that must be set during initialization:With this setup, it\'s invalid to assign to firstName or lastName after calling (e.g.) Person(first:"Malcolm", last:"Reynolds") to create a Person instance.You must define a type for all variables (let or var) at compile time, and any code that attempts to set a variable may only use that type (or a subtype). You can assign a value at run time, but its type must be known at compile time.One more difference, which I\'ve encountered in other languages for Constants is : can\'t initialise the constant(let) for later , should initialise as you\'re about to declare the constant.For instance :Variable let is used to declare a constant value that means you won\'t change it after give it an initial value.\nvar is used to decalre a variable value that means you could change it\'s value as you wish.let is used to define constants and var to define variables.\nYou define the string using var then particular String can be modified (or mutated) by assigning it to a variable (in which case it can be modified), and if you define the string using let its a constant (in which case it cannot be modified):Like Luc-Oliver, NullData, and a few others have said here, let defines immutable data while var defines mutable data. Any func that can be called on the variable that is marked mutating can only be called if it is a var variable (compiler will throw error). This also applies to func\'s that take in an inout variable.However, let and var also mean that the variable cannot be reassigned. It has two meanings, both with very similar purposesvar value can be change, after initialize. But let value is not be change, when it is intilize once.In case of varIn case of letThe keyword var is used to define a variable whose value you can easily change like this:However, the let keyword is only to create a constant used when you do not want to change the value of the constant again. If you were to try changing the value of the constant, you will get an error:\xe2\x80\x9cUse let to make a constant and var to make a variable\xe2\x80\x9dExcerpt From: Apple Inc. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Swift Programming Language.\xe2\x80\x9d iBooks. https://itun.es/us/jEUH0.llet keyword defines a constantso myNum can\'t be changed afterwards;But var defines an ordinary variable.The value of a constant doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be known at compile time, but you must assign it a value exactly once.You can use almost any character you like for constant and variable names, including Unicode characters;e.g.But if we take let then...Everyone has pretty much answered this but here\'s a way you can remember what\'s what Let will always say the same think of "let" as let this work for once and always as for "var" variable\'s can always change hence them being called variable\'s Let is an immutable variable, meaning that it cannot be changed, other languages call this a constant. In C++ it you can define it as const.Var is a mutable variable, meaning that it can be changed. In C++ (2011 version update), it is the same as using auto, though swift allows for more flexibility in the usage. This is the more well-known variable type to beginners.let is a constant value, so it can never be changed.Var is a variable, and can change (but after it is defined not to a different data type.)If you try changing the variable to a different dataType, it will not workvar is the only way to create a variables in swift. var doesn\'t mean dynamic variable as in the case of interpreted languages like javascript. For example,In this case, the type of variable name is inferred that name is of type String, we can also create variables by explicitly defining type, for exampleNow if you assign a string to age, then the compiler gives the error. let is used to declare constants. For exampleOr we can also do,If you try to change the value of city, it gives error at compile time.The main difference is that var variable value can change, and let can\'t. If you want to have a user input data, you would use var so the value can be changed and use let datatype variable so the value can not be changed. A value can be reassigned in case of var** the newAge constant cannot be reassigned to a new value. Trying to do so will give a compile time error**In swift we have two types of variablesboth of these job are same , contain objects(copy value ,reference value and etc).In var variable I can change containing object to another one while program executingIn let variable I cannot change containing object to another one while program executing instead I have to initialize it first.It is like constant or final in another languages like Java,C++.Though currently I am still reading the manual, but I think this is very close to C/C++ const pointer. In other words, something like difference between char const* and char*. Compiler also refuses to update content, not only reference reassignment (pointer).For example, let\'s say you have this struct. Take care that this is a struct, not a class. AFAIK, classes don\'t have a concept of immutable state.Because the structs are immutable by default, you need to mark a mutator method with mutating. And because the name aaa1 is constant, you can\'t call any mutator method on it. This is exactly what we expected on C/C++ pointers.I believe this is a mechanism to support a kind of const-correctness stuff.Declare constants with the let keyword and variables with the var keyword.Declare multiple constants or multiple variables on a single line, separated by commas:Printing Constants and VariablesYou can print the current value of a constant or variable with the println function:Swift uses string interpolation to include the name of a constant or variable as a placeholder in a longer stringWrap the name in parentheses and escape it with a backslash before the opening parenthesis:Reference : http://iosswift.com.au/?p=17Found a good answer hope it can help :)
