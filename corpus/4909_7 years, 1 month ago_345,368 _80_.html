Currently we are using the following commands in PHP to set the character set to UTF-8 in our application. Since this is a bit of overhead, we\'d like to set this as the default setting in MySQL. Can we do this in /etc/my.cnf or in another location?I\'ve looked for a default charset in /etc/my.cnf, but there\'s nothing there about charsets.At this point, I did the following to set the MySQL charset and collation variables to UTF-8:Is that a correct way to handle this?To set the default to UTF-8, you want to add the following to my.cnfIf you want to change the character set for an existing DB, let me know... your question didn\'t specify it directly so I am not sure if that\'s what you want to do.For the recent version of MySQL,causes a problem. It\'s deprecated I think.As Justin Ball says in "Upgrade to MySQL 5.5.12 and now MySQL won\xe2\x80\x99t start, you should:Remove that directive and you should be good. Then your configuration file (\'/etc/my.cnf\' for example) should look like that:Restart MySQL.For making sure, your MySQL is UTF-8, run the following queries in your MySQL prompt:First query:The output should look like:Second query:And the query output is:On MySQL 5.5 I have in my.cnfResult is This question already has a lot of answers, but Mathias Bynens mentioned that \'utf8mb4\' should be used instead of \'utf8\' in order to have better UTF-8 support (\'utf8\' does not support 4 byte characters, fields are truncated on insert). I consider this to be an important difference. So here is yet another answer on how to set the default character set and collation. One that\'ll allow you to insert a pile of poo (\xf0\x9f\x92\xa9).This works on MySQL 5.5.35.Note, that some of the settings may be optional. As I\'m not entirely sure that I haven\'t forgotten anything, I\'ll make this answer a community wiki.character_set_system is always utf8.This won\'t affect existing tables, it\'s just the default setting (used for new tables).\nThe following ALTER code can be used to convert an existing table (without the dump-restore workaround):Edit:On a MySQL 5.0 server: character_set_client, character_set_connection, character_set_results, collation_connection remain at latin1. Issuing SET NAMES utf8 (utf8mb4 not available in that version) sets those to utf8 as well.Caveat:\nIf you had a utf8 table with an index column of type VARCHAR(255), it can\'t be converted in some cases, because the maximum key length is exceeded (Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes.). If possible, reduce the column size from 255 to 191 (because 191 * 4 = 764 < 767 < 192 * 4 = 768). After that, the table can be converted.NijaCat was close, but specified overkill:To set the default to UTF-8, you want to add the following to my.cnfThen, to verify:I also have found out that after setting default-character-set = utf8 under [mysqld] title, MySQL 5.5.x would not start under UbuntuÂ 12.04 (Precise Pangolin).MySQL v5.5.3 and greater:Just add three lines only in the [mysqld] section:Note: Including skip-character-set-client-handshake here obviates the need to include both init-connect in [mysqld] and default-character-set in the [client] and [mysql] sections.Note:\nmy.cnf file is located at /etc/mysql/ After adding therse lines:Don\'t forget to restart server:Under Xubuntu 12.04 I simply addedto /etc/mysql/my.cnfAnd the result isAlso take a look at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/charset-server.htmlAll settings listed here are correct, but here are the most optimal and sufficient solution:Add these to /etc/mysql/my.cnf.Please note, I choose utf8_unicode_ci type of collation due to the performance issue.The result is:And this is when you connect as non-SUPER user!For example, the difference between connection as SUPER and non-SUPER user (of course in case of utf8_unicode_ci collation):user with SUPER priv.:  user with non-SUPER priv.:I wrote a comprehensive article (rus) explaining in details why you should use one or the other option. All types of Character Sets and Collations are considered: for server, for database, for connection, for table and even for column.I hope this and the article will help to clarify unclear moments.The directive has changed to character-set-system=utf8http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/charset-configuration.htmlMySQL versions and Linux distributions may matter when making configurations.However, the changes under [mysqld] section is encouraged.I want to give a short explanation of tomazzlender\'s answer:[mysqld] This will change collation_connection to utf8_unicode_ciUsing SET NAMES:The SET NAMES will influence three characters, that is: This will set character_set_database & character_set_serverThis will only affect collation_database & collation_serverSorry, I\'m not so sure what is this for. I don\'t use it however:On Fedora 21Add follow:Save and exit. Final remember restart service mysqld with service mysqld restart.MySQL 5.5, all you need is:collation_server is optional.If you\'re having trouble confirming the client\'s character-set support using MySQL Workbench, then keep the following note in mind:Important\nAll connections opened by MySQL Workbench automatically set the client character\nset to utf8. Manually changing the client character set, such as using SET NAMES\n..., may cause MySQL Workbench to not correctly display the characters. For\nadditional information about client character sets, see Connection Character Sets\nand Collations.Thus I was unable to override MySQL Workbench\'s character sets with my.cnf changes. e.g. \'set names utf8mb4\'If you are confused by your setting for client and conn is reseted after restart mysql service. Try these steps (which worked for me):Check the reference for more info.You can do it the way it does, and if it doesn\'t work, you need to restart mysql.Change MySQL character:We should not write default-character-set=utf8 in mysqld, because that could result in an error like:start: Job failed to startAt last:
