I have "Hello World" kept in a String variable named hi.I need to print it, but reversed.How can I do this? I understand there is some kind of a function already built-in into Java that does that.Related: Reverse each individual word of \xe2\x80\x9cHello World\xe2\x80\x9d string with JavaYou can use this:Or, for versions earlier than JDK 1.5, use java.util.StringBuffer instead of StringBuilder \xe2\x80\x94 they have the same API. Thanks commentators for pointing out that StringBuilder is preferred nowadays.For Online Judges problems that does not allow StringBuilder or StringBuffer, you can do it in place using char[] as following:http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Language-Basics/ReverseStringTest.htmI am doing this using following two ways:Reverse string by CHARACTERS:Reverse string by WORDS:Here is an example using recursion:Take a look at the Java 6 API under StringBufferHere is a low level solution:I tried, just for fun, by using a Stack. Here my code:Since the below method (using XOR) to reverse a string is not listed, I am attaching this method to reverse a string.The Algorithm is based on :1.(A XOR B) XOR B = A 2.(A XOR B) XOR A = BCode snippet:Output:keetarpIt is very simple in minimum code of linesAs others have pointed out the preferred way is to use:new StringBuilder(hi).reverse().toString()but if you want to implement this by youself, i\'am afraid that the rest of responses have flaws.The reason is that String represent a list of Unicode points, encoded in a char[] array according to the variable-length encoding: UTF-16. This means some code points use a single element of the array (one code unit) but others use two of them, so there might be pairs of characters that must be treated as a single unit (consecutive "high" and "low" surrogates)This did the trick for meI used this method to turn names backwards and into lower case.If you want to use a simple for loop!One natural way to reverse a String is to use a StringTokenizer and a stack. Stack is a class that implements an easy-to-use last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack of objects.Put it in the stack frontwardsPrint the stack backwardsAll above solution is too good but here I am making reverse string using recursive programming. This is helpful for who is looking recursive way of doing reverse string. It gets the value you typed and returns it reversed ;)}public String reverseWords(String s) {You can also try this:1. Using Character Array:2. Using StringBuilder:ORReversing a String by Character:Reversing a String by Word:public class Main {We can use split() to split the string .Then use reverse loop and add the characters.
