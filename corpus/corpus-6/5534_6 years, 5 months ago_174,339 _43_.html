I want to transfer a list object via Google Gson, but I don\'t know how to deserialize generic types. What I tried after looking at this (BalusC\'s answer):but then I get an error in eclipse saying "The type new List(){} must implement the inherited abstract method..." and if I use a quick fix I get a monster of over 20 method stubs. I am pretty sure that there is an easier solution, but I seem unable to find it!Edit:Now I have However, I do get the following exception at the "fromJson" line:I do catch JsonParseExceptions and "result" is not null.I checked listType with the debugger and got the following:so it seems the "getClass" invocation didn\'t work properly. Any suggestions...?Edit2:\nI\'v checked on the Gson User Guide. It mentions a Runtime Exception that should happen during parsing a generic type to Json. I did it "wrong" (not shown above), just as in the example, but didn\'t get that exception at all. So I changed the serialization as in the user guide suggested. Didn\'t help, though.Edit3: \nSolved, see my answer below.Method to deserialize generic collection:Import : import java.lang.reflect.Type;Another way is to use an array as a type, e.g.:This way you avoid all the hassle with the Type object, and if you really need a list you can always convert the array to a list by:IMHO this is much more readable.And to make it be an actual list (that can be modified, see limitations of Arrays.asList()) then just do the following:For those getting ambiguous Type import suggestions this is the one you want.Refer to this post.\nJava Type Generic as Argument for GSONI have better solution for this. Here\'s the wrapper class for list so the wrapper can store the exactly type of list.And then, the code can be simple:Wep, another way to achieve the same result. We use it for its readability.Instead of doing this hard-to-read sentence:Create a empty class that extends a List of your object:And use it when parsing the JSON:Example:As it answers my original question, I have accepted doc_180\'s answer, but if someone runs into this problem again, I will answer the 2nd half of my question as well:The NullPointerError I described had nothing to do with the List itself, but with its content! The "MyClass" class didn\'t have a "no args" constructor, and neither had its superclass one. Once I added a simple "MyClass()" constructor to MyClass and its superclass, everything worked fine, including the List serialization and deserialization as suggested by doc_180.Here is a solution that works with a dynamically defined type.  The trick is creating the proper type of of array using Array.newInstance().I want to add for one more possibility. If you don\'t want to use TypeToken and want to convert json objects array to an ArrayList, then you can proceed like this:If your json structure is like:}and your class structure is like:then you can parse it like:Now you can access each element of className object.I liked the answer from kays1 but I couldn\'t implement it. So I built my own version using his concept.Usage:In My case @uncaught_exceptions\'s answer didn\'t work, I had to use List.class instead of java.lang.reflect.Type:Refer to example 2 for \'Type\' class understanding of Gson.Example 1: In this deserilizeResturant we used Employee[] array and get the detailsExample 2:
