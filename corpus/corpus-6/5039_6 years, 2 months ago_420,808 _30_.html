And this is my App.config: But when my project runs this is my error:Object reference not set to an instance of an object.Can\'t you just do the following: Your assembly also needs a reference to System.Configuration.dllSince this is very common question I have prepared some screen shots from Visual Studio to make it easy to follow in 4 simple steps.Also check that you\'ve included the System.Configuration dll under your references. Without it, you won\'t have access to the ConfigurationManager class in the System.Configuration namespace.First Add a reference of System.Configuration to your page.Then According to your app.config get the connection string as follow.That\'s it now you have your connection string in your hand and you can use it.Try this out 1) Create a new form and add this:then when you want to use the connection do this in ur form:and thats it. You will be connected to the DB and can do stuff. This is for vb.net but the logic is the same. Have you tried:You can fetch the connection string by using below line of code -Here is a reference : \nConnection String from App.configI had the same Issue. my solution was built up from two projects. A Class library and a website referencing to the class library project. the problem was that i was trying to access the App.config in my Class library project but the system was searching in Web.config of the website. I put the connection string inside Web.config and ... problem solved!The main reason was that despite ConfigurationManager was used in another assembly it was searching inside the runnig project .It seems like problem is not with reference, you are getting connectionstring as null so please make sure you have added the value to the config file your running project meaning the main program/library that gets started/executed first.It is possible that the OP in this question is trying to use an App.Config within a dll.In this case, the code is actually trying to access the App.Config of the executable and not the dll.  Since the name is not found, you get a Null returned, hence the exception shown.The following post may be helpful:\nConnectionString from app.config of a DLL is nullI referenced System.Configuration library and I have the same error.\nThe debug files had not their app.config, create manually this file.\nThe error is, I solved this copying the file "appname.exe.config" in debug folder. The IDE was not create the file.First you have to add System.Configuration reference to your project and then use below code to get connection string.This worked for me:Outputs:Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=OmidPayamak;IntegratedSecurity=True"
