I\'m using Android Studio and when I add compile "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.0"\n to my Gradle file, I\'m getting a ton of errors:All of these seem to be showing up in:and AppCompat v21 builds themes that require the new APIs provided in API 21 (Android 5.0). To compile your application with AppCompat, you must also compile against API 21. The recommended setup for compiling/building with API 21 is a compileSdkVersion of 21 and a buildToolsVersion of 21.0.1 (which is the highest at this time - you always want to use the latest build tools).Make sure the value for target (which tells the target android version) in project.properties file of both your project folder and appcompat_v7 folder is same (preferably the latest).: inside \'your_project\'/project.properties target=android-21\nandroid.library.reference.1=../appcompat_v7and: inside appcompat_v7/project.propertiestarget=android-21\nandroid.library=trueand after this don\'t forget to clean your project .Changing compile \'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.0\' into compile \'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:20.0.0\' in gradle.build works for me.If you are using android studio goto \nFile --> Project Structure \nIn the Properties tab change Compile Sdk Version to AP1 21 and Build Tools Version to highest available version.\nAnd then Refresh Gradlechanging the complie SDk version to API level 21 fixed it for me. then i ran into others issues of deploying the app to my device. i changed the minimun API level to target to what i want and that fixed it.incase someone is experiencing this again.Just select target api level to 21 for compiling, click Apply -> click OK, clean and build project and run it.my solucion is compile with other versionbuild.gradle (app)Good LuckChange your compile sdk to 23.This fixed it for me.I vote whoever can solve like me.\nI had this same problem as u , I spent many hours to get correct .\nPlease test .Upgrade entire SDK , the update 21.0.2 build also has updates from Google Services play .\nUpgrade everything.\nIn your workspace delete folders ( android -support- v7 - AppCompat ) and ( google -play - services_lib )Re-import these projects into the IDE and select to copy them to your workspace again.The project ( google -play - services_lib ) to perform the action of Refresh and Build**** ***** Problem\nThe project ( android -support- v7 - AppCompat ) mark the 5.0 API then Refresh and Build .In his project , in properties , android , import libraries ( android -support- v7 - AppCompat ) and ( google -play - services_lib ) then Refresh and Build .If you don\'t want to use API 21 you can use the older version of appcompact library, use older app compact library without updating it.you can achieve this by simply following steps:1) Extract the downloaded version of complete sdk and eclipse bundle.2) Simply import appCompact library from sdk\\extras\\android\\support\\v7\\appcompactnow you are done.Quoting from here:To resolve this issue,I have updated the build.gradle(Module: app):\nOld Code:New Code:Works for me in android studio.Resource for android will be a option available when you go to your sdk manager and select Android 5.0. Download and install that. This will fix the problem of resource not found.Hi there I was having the same error involving the appcompatv7 library and I did as @ianhanniballake suggested and check the build version of the library, by selecting it and giving a click with the secondary button of the mouse then:Properties -> Android -> Android 5.0.1 api level 21then clean all projects but I had no luck, so after loosing all my hopes I decided to upgrade from Eclipse Kepler to Eclipse Luna.While I was waiting for the download to complete. I decided to try another thing, so I went and delete from eclipse the appcompatv7 library and checked theDelete project contents on disk.Opened the Android SDK to check if there were any updates, then I removed all library references from my project by selecting my project and under Project -> Properties -> Android -> Library sectionremoved all libraries including the one that started all this problem Google_Play_Services_Libthen restarted Eclipse and copied from the Android SDK.The folder appcompat from:android-sdk-linux/extras/android/support/v7To my eclpse workspace, then imported it agan in to Eclipse from Import exsting project in workspace then choose the propper build tool version Android 5.0.1 api 21and added all my reference libraries, cleaned all projects and done everything was working again.I choose for all my reference libraries the same build tool. Hope this helps!!!!By the way I tried to give a vote but I haven\'t had enough rep to do it.Check adding google play services  here as i was facing the same problem and removed everything then followed the steps and got everything working.I ran into the same issue and had the right API level values in my build.gradle compileSdkVersion 21, targetSdkVersion 21 and a buildToolsVersion of 21.0.1However, I was including this as a module in my project so I had to make sure the other module gradle settings matched API 21. After that it all worked for me.I changed into in build.gradle and after sync I didn\'t get any errorsIn my case with Eclipse IDE, I had the same problem and the solution was: \n1- Install the latest available API (SDK Platform & Google APIs) \n2- Create the project with the following settings:For me works this:I modified: \ncompileSdkVersion 21\nbuildToolsVersion \'23.0\'\nappcompat-v7:22.2.0\'I was facing this problem when I imported google-services.json file to implement Analytics. I already had global_tracker.xml file in the xml folder. During build, while merging contents from google-services.json file, the error was started occurring. For time being, the error is resolved after removing the goolgle-services.json file. And using the older Analytics solution. Check the last XML or Json file that you edited/imported and maybe you will file error there. That\'s what helped in my case.THIS HELPED MEUpdate app/build.gradle with latest components:Hope this solves your problemThis works very well for me. Go to the android-support-v7-appcompat project and open the file "project.properties" and insert this lines if missing:
