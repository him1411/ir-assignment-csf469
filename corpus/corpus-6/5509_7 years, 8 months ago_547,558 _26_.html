Can anyone show me how to do a php curl with an HTTP POST?I want to send data like this:To www.domain.comI expect the curl to return a response like result=OK.  Are there any examples?Because this thread is high in Google\'s results for sending post with curl in php, I would like to provide most valid answer as all others above and below do unnecessary work, while the answer is pretty straightforward:ProceduralObject orientedSide note here: it would be best to create some kind of interface called AdapterInterface for example with getResponse() method and let the class above implement it. Then you can always swap this implementation with another adapter of your like, without any side effects to your application.Using HTTPS / encrypting trafficUsually there\'s a problem with cURL in PHP under the Windows operating system. While trying to connect to a https protected endpoint, you will get an error telling you that certificate verify failed.What most people do here is to tell the cURL library to simply ignore certificate errors and continue (curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);). As this will make your code work, you introduce huge security hole and enable malicious users to perform various attacks on your app like Man In The Middle attack or such.Never, ever do that. Instead, you simply need to modify your php.ini and tell PHP where your CA Certificate file is to let it verify certificates correctly:The latest cacert.pem can be downloaded from the Internet or extracted from your favorite browser. When changing any php.ini related settings remember to restart your webserver.Put this in a file called foobar.php:Then run it with the command php foobar.php, it dumps this kind of output to screen:So you did a PHP POST to www.google.com and sent it some data.Had the server been programmed to read in the post variables, it could decide to do something different based upon that.It\'s can be easily reached with:If the form is using redirects, authentication, cookies, SSL (https), or anything else other than a totally open script expecting POST variables, you are going to start nashing your teeth really quick.

Begin php page with:If at some point there is information you want to generate in PHP and pass to the next page in the session, instead of using a POST variable, assign it to a SESSION variable.  Example:Then on the next page you simply reference this SESSION variable.
