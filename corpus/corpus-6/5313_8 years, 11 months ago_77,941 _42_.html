Emacs puts backup files named foo~ everywhere and I don\'t like having to remember to delete them.  Also, if I edit a file that has a hard link somewhere else in the file system, the hard link points to the backup when I\'m done editing, and that\'s confusing and awful.  How can I either eliminate these backup files, or have them go somewhere other than the same directory?If you\'ve ever been saved by an Emacs backup file, you\nprobably want more of them, not less of them.  It is annoying\nthat they go in the same directory as the file you\'re editing,\nbut that is easy to change.  You can make all backup files go\ninto a directory by putting something like the following in your\n.emacs.There are a number of arcane details associated with how Emacs\nmight create your backup files.  Should it rename the original\nand write out the edited buffer?  What if the original is linked?\nIn general, the safest but slowest bet is to always make backups\nby copying.If that\'s too slow for some reason you might also have a look at\nbackup-by-copying-when-linked.Since your backups are all in their own place now, you might want\nmore of them, rather than less of them.  Have a look at the Emacs\ndocumentation for these variables (with C-h v).Finally, if you absolutely must have no backup files:It makes me sick to think of it though.Emacs backup/auto-save files can be very helpful. But these features are confusing. Backup filesBackup files have tildes (~ or ~9~) at the end and shall be written to the user home directory. When make-backup-files is non-nil Emacs automatically creates a backup of the original file the first time the file is saved from a buffer. If you\'re editing a new file Emacs will create a backup the second time you save the file. No matter how many times you save the file the backup remains unchanged. If you kill the buffer and then visit the file again, or the next time you start a new Emacs session, a new backup file will be made.  The new backup reflects the file\'s content after reopened, or at the start of editing sessions. But an existing backup is never touched again. Therefore I find it useful to created numbered backups (see the configuration below). To create backups explicitly use save-buffer (C-x C-s) with prefix arguments. diff-backup and dired-diff-backup compares a file with its backup or vice versa. But there is no function to restore backup files. For example, under Windows, to restore a backup fileit has to be manually copied asAuto-save filesAuto-save files use hashmarks (#) and shall be written locally within the project directory (along with the actual files). The reason is that auto-save files are just temporary files that Emacs creates until a file is saved again (like with hurrying obedience).  When the user saves the file, the auto-saved version is deleted. But when the user exits the file without saving it, Emacs or the X session crashes, the auto-saved files still exist. Use revert-buffer or recover-file to restore auto-save files. Note that Emacs records interrupted sessions for later recovery in files named ~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list. The recover-session function will use this information.The preferred method to recover from an auto-saved filed is M-x revert-buffer RET. Emacs will ask either "Buffer has been auto-saved recently. Revert from auto-save file?" or "Revert buffer from file FILENAME?". In case of the latter there is no auto-save file. For example, because you have saved before typing another auto-save-intervall keystrokes, in which case Emacs had deleted the auto-save file.Auto-save is nowadays disabled by default because it can slow down editing when connected to a slow machine, and because many files contain sensitive data.ConfigurationHere is a configuration that IMHO works best:Sensitive dataAnother problem is that you don\'t want to have Emacs spread copies of files with sensitive data. Use this mode on a per-file basis.  As this is a minor mode, for my purposes I renamed it sensitive-minor-mode.To enable it for all .vcf and .gpg files, in your .emacs use something like:Alternatively, to protect only some files, like some .txt files, use a line likein the file.The accepted answer is\ngood, but it can be greatly improved by additionally backing up on\nevery save and backing up versioned files.First, basic settings as described in the accepted\nanswer:Next, also backup versioned files, which Emacs does not do by default\n(you don\'t commit on every save, right?):Finally, make a backup on each save, not just the first. We make two\nkinds of backups:per-session backups: once on the first save of the buffer in each\nEmacs session. These simulate Emac\'s default backup behavior.per-save backups: once on every save. Emacs does not do this by\ndefault, but it\'s very useful if you leave Emacs running for a long\ntime.The backups go in different\nplaces and Emacs\ncreates the backup dirs automatically if they don\'t exist:I became very interested in this topic after I wrote $< instead of\n$@ in my Makefile, about three hours after my previous commit :PThe above is based on an Emacs Wiki page I heavily\nedited.Another way of configuring backup options is via the Customize interface.  Enter:And then at the Customize group: prompt enter backup.If you scroll to the bottom of the buffer you\'ll see Backup Directory Alist.  Click Show Value and set the first entry of the list as follows:Alternatively, you can turn backups off my setting Make Backup Files to off.If you don\'t want Emacs to automatically edit your .emacs file you\'ll want to set up a customisations file.You can disable them altogether by
