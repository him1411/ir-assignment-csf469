I have searched Google and can\'t find anything on this.I have this code.With some data like this And the output is something like this.How is it possible to set the first option in the data as the default value so you would get a result like this.You can simply use ng-init like thisIf you want to make sure your $scope.somethingHere value doesn\'t get overwritten when your view initializes, you\'ll want to coalesce (somethingHere = somethingHere || options[0].value) the value in your ng-init like so:Try this:HTMLJavascriptPlunker here.If you really want to set the value that will be bound to the model, then change the ng-options attribute toand the Javascript toAnother Plunker here considering the above.I think, after the inclusion of \'track by\', you can use it in ng-options to get what you wanted, like the followingThis way of doing it is better because when you want to replace the list of strings with list of objects you will just change this to where somethingHere is an object with the properties name and id, of course. Please note, \'as\' is not used in this way of expressing the ng-options, because it will only set the value and you will not be able to change it when you are using track byOnly one answer by Srivathsa Harish Venkataramana mentioned track by which is indeed a solution for this!Here is an example along with Plunker (link below) of how to use track by in select ng-options:If selectedCity is defined on angular scope, and it has id property with the same value as any id of any city on the cities list, it\'ll be auto selected on load.Here is Plunker for this:\n  http://plnkr.co/edit/1EVs7R20pCffewrG0EmI?p=previewSee source documentation for more details:\nhttps://code.angularjs.org/1.3.15/docs/api/ng/directive/selectThe accepted answer use ng-init, but document says to avoid ng-init if possible. The only appropriate use of ngInit is for aliasing special properties\n  of ngRepeat, as seen in the demo below. Besides this case, you should\n  use controllers rather than ngInit to initialize values on a scope.You also can use ng-repeat  instead of ng-options for your options. With ng-repeat, you can use ng-selected with ng-repeat special properties. i.e. $index, $odd, $even to make this work without any coding. $first is one of the ng-repeat special properties.---------------------- EDIT ----------------\nAlthough this works, I would prefer @mik-t\'s answer when you know what value to select, https://stackoverflow.com/a/29564802/454252, which uses track-by and ng-options without using ng-init or ng-repeat.This answer should only be used when you must select the first item without knowing what value to choose. e.g., I am using this for auto completion which requires to choose the FIRST item all the time.My solution to this was use html to hardcode my default option. Like so:In HAML:In HTML:I want my default option to return all values from my api, that\'s why I have a blank value. Also excuse my haml. I know this isn\'t directly an answer to the OP\'s question, but people find this on Google. Hope this helps someone else.Use below code to populate selected option from your model.Depending on how many options you have, you could put your values in an array and auto-populate your options like thisIn my case, I was need to insert a initial value only to tell to user to select an option, so, I do like the code below:When I tryed an option with the value != of an empty string (null) the option was substituted by angular, but, when put an option like that (with null value), the select apear with this option.Sorry by my bad english and I hope that I help in something with this.See the ngOptions documentation for more ngOptions usage examples.plnkr.coOfficial documentation about HTML SELECT element with angular data-binding.plnkr.cojsfiddleThis worked for me.In my case since the default varies from case to case in the form.\nI add a custom attribute in the select tag.in the directives I created a script that checks the value and when angular fills it in sets the option with that value to selected.}) just translated this from coffescript on the fly at least the jist of it is correct if not the hole thing.It\'s not the simplest way but get it done when the value variesIn response to Ben Lesh\'s answer, there should be this lineinstead ofThat is,Simply use ng-selected="true" as follows:I would set the model in the controller. Then the select will default to that value. Ex: \nhtml:Angular controller (using resource):If you are using ng-options to render you drop down than option having same value as of ng-modal is default selected.\nConsider the example:So option having same value of  list.key and selectedItem, is default selected.If you have some thing instead of just init the date part, you can use ng-init() by declare it in your controller, and use it in the top of your HTML.\nThis function will work like a constructor for your controller, and you can initiate your variables there.I think the easiest way isThis working for meI needed the default \xe2\x80\x9cPlease Select\xe2\x80\x9d to be unselectable.  I also needed to be able to conditionally set a default selected option. I achieved this the following simplistic way:\nJS code:\n    // Flip these 2 to test selected default or no default with default \xe2\x80\x9cPlease Select\xe2\x80\x9d text\n    //$scope.defaultOption = 0;\n    $scope.defaultOption = { key: \'3\', value: \'Option 3\' };HTML:I hope this helps someone else that has similar requirements.The "Please Select" was accomplished through Joffrey Outtier\'s answer here. try this in your angular controller...$somethingHere = {name: \'Something Cool\'};You can set a value, but you are using a complex type and the angular will search key/value to set in your view.And, if does not work, try this :\nng-options="option.value as option.name for option in options track by option.name"
