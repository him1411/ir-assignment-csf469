I am using Twitter bootstrap, I have specified a modalAnd the links When I click on any of these link for the first time, I see the correct content, but when I click on other links it shows the same content loaded for the first time, it doesn\'t update the content.I want it to be updated every time its clicked.P.S : I can easily make it work via custom jQuery function, but I want to know if it\'s possible with native Bootstrap modal remote function, as it should be easy enough and I guess I am just complicating things.The problem is two-fold.First, once a Modal object is instantiated, it is persistently attached to the element specified by data-target and subsequent calls to show that modal will only call toggle() on it, but will not update the values in the options.  So, even though the href attributes are different on your different links, when the modal is toggled, the value for remote is not getting updated.  For most options, one can get around this by directly editing the object.  For instance:Second, the Modal plugin is designed to load the remote resource in the constructor of the Modal object, which unfortunately means that even if a change is made to the options.remote, it will never be reloaded.A simple remedy is to destroy the Modal object before subsequent toggles. One option is to just destroy it after it finishes hiding:Note: Adjust the selectors as needed. This is the most general.Or you could try coming up with a more complicated scheme to do something like check whether the link launching the modal is different from the previous one.  If it is, destroy; if it isn\'t, then no need to reload.For bootstrap 3 you should use:For Bootstrap 3.1 you\'ll want to remove data and empty the modal-content rather than the whole dialog (3.0) to avoid the flicker while waiting for remote content to load.If you are using non-remote modals then the above code will, of course, remove their content once closed (bad). You may need to add something to those modals (like a .local-modal class) so they aren\'t affected. Then modify the above code to:Thanks merv. I started tinkering around boostrap.js but your answer is a quick and clean workaround. Here\'s what I ended up using in my code.The accepted answer didn\'t work for me, so I went with JavaScript to do it.This works with Bootstrap 3 FYIMy project is built in Yii & uses the Bootstrap-Yii plugin, so this answer is only relevant if you\'re using Yii.The above fix did work but only after the first time the modal was shown. The first time it came up empty. I think that\'s because after my initiation of the code Yii calls the hide function of the modal thereby clearing out my initiation variables. I found that putting the removeData call immediately before the code that launched the modal did the trick. So my code is structured like this...In Bootstrap 3.2.0 the "on" event has to be on the document and you have to empty the modal :In Bootstrap 3.1.0 the "on" event can be on the body :Why not make it more general with BS 3? Just use "[something]modal" as the ID of the modal DIV.Only working option for me is: I use Bootstrap 3 and I have a function called\npopup(\'popup content\')\nwhich appends the modal box html. Adding an $(this).html(\'\'); to clear visible data as well, and it works pretty fineIf a remote URL is provided, content will be loaded one time via jQuery\'s load method and injected into the .modal-content div. If you\'re using the data-api, you may alternatively use the href attribute to specify the remote source. An example of this is shown belowI\'ve added something like this, because the older content is shown until the new one appears, with .html(\'\') inside the .modal-content will clear the HTML inside, hope it helpsI wrote a simple snippet handling the refreshing of the modal.\nBasically it stores the clicked link in the modal\'s data and check if it\'s the same link that has been clicked, removing or not the modal data.For Bootstrap 3, in modal.js I changed:to(extra spacing added for clarity)This prevents any unwanted flash of old modal content by calling empty() on the modal container as well as removing the data. This one works for me.This other approach works well for me:Which html element you want to empty like(div,span whatever).This one works for me:modalscriptlinks-area is area where i put the data and need to clearExpanded version of accepted answer by @merv. It also checks if modal being hidden is loaded from remote source and clears old content to prevent it from flashing.https://gist.github.com/WojtekKruszewski/ae86d7fb59879715ae1e6dd623f743c5Tested on Bootstrap version 3.3.2Good luck with this one:
