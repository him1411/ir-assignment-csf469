I have a maven program, it compiles fine.  When I run mvn test it does not run any tests (under TESTs header says There are no tests to run.).  I\'ve recreated this problem with a super simple setup which I will include below as well as the output when run with -X.The unit tests run fine from eclipse (both with its default junit package and when I instead include the junit.jar downloaded by maven).  Also mvn test-compile correctly creates the class under test-classes.  I am running this on OSX 10.6.7 with Maven 3.0.2 and java 1.6.0_24.Here is the directory structure:pom.xml:ClassUnderTest.java:ClassUnderTestTests.java:End of mvn -X test:By default Maven uses the following naming conventions when looking for tests to run:Your test class doesn\'t follow these conventions. You should rename it or configure Maven Surefire Plugin to use another pattern for test classes.I also found that the unit test code should put under the test folder, it can not be recognized as test class if you put it under the main folder.\neg.WrongRightAnother thing that can cause Maven to not find the tests if if the module\'s packaging is not declared correctly.In a recent case, someone had <packaging>pom</packaging> and my tests never ran. I changed it to <packaging>jar</packaging> and now it works fine.Also, check if your test classes directory (e.g. src/test/java) corresponds to directory listed in property <testSourceDirectory> in your pom.xml under <build> property. Took me a while to find that.Check that (for jUnit - 4.12 and Eclipse surefire plugin)If you have a shared Java / Groovy application and all you have are Groovy unit tests, then Maven won\'t find any tests.  This can be fixed by adding one unit test under src/test/java.Discovered if you prefix a test with \'Abstract\' it will be ignored by default aswell.Maven will not run your tests if the project has <packaging>pom</packaging>You need to set the packaging to jar (or some other java artefact type) for the tests to run: <packaging>jar</packaging>I also had similar issue, after exploring found that testng dependency is causing this issue. After removing the testng dependency from pom (as I dont need it anymore), it started to work fine for me.junitArtifactName might also be the case if the JUnit in use isn\'t the standard (junit:junit) but for instance...Another reason for not running the test cases happened to me - I had a property named "test" for completely different purposes, but it interfered with the surefire plugin. Thus, please check your POMs for:and remove it.
