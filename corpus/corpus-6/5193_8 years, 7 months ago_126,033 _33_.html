I have a Unicode string in Python, and I would like to remove all the accents (diacritics).I found on the Web an elegant way to do this in Java:Do I need to install a library such as pyICU or is this possible with just the python standard library?  And what about python 3?Important note: I would like to avoid code with an explicit mapping from accented characters to their non-accented counterpart.Unidecode is the correct answer for this. It transliterates any unicode string into the closest possible representation in ascii text.Example:How about this:This works on greek letters, too:The character category "Mn" stands for Nonspacing_Mark, which is similar to unicodedata.combining in MiniQuark\'s answer (I didn\'t think of unicodedata.combining, but it is probably the better solution, because it\'s more explicit).And keep in mind, these manipulations may significantly alter the meaning of the text. Accents, Umlauts etc. are not "decoration".I just found this answer on the Web:It works fine (for French, for example), but I think the second step (removing the accents) could be handled better than dropping the non-ASCII characters, because this will fail for some languages (Greek, for example).  The best solution would probably be to explicitly remove the unicode characters that are tagged as being diacritics.Edit: this does the trick:unicodedata.combining(c) will return true if the character c can be combined with the preceding character, that is mainly if it\'s a diacritic.Edit 2: remove_accents expects a unicode string, not a byte string.  If you have a byte string, then you must decode it into a unicode string like this:I\'m surprised no one suggested a simple: You can download unidecode lib here.This handles not only accents, but also "strokes" (as in \xc3\xb8 etc.):This is the most elegant way I can think of (and it has been mentioned by alexis in a comment on this page), although I don\'t think it is very elegant indeed.There are still special letters that are not handled by this, such as turned and inverted letters, since their unicode name does not contain \'WITH\'. It depends on what you want to do anyway. I sometimes needed accent stripping for achieving dictionary sort order.Actually I work on project compatible python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.4 and I have to create IDs from free user entries. Thanks to you, I have created this function that works wonders.result:In response to @MiniQuark\'s answer:I was trying to read in a csv file that was half-French (containing accents) and also some strings which would eventually become integers and floats.\nAs a test, I created a test.txt file that looked like this:Montr\xc3\xa9al, \xc3\xbcber, 12.89, M\xc3\xa8re, Fran\xc3\xa7oise, no\xc3\xabl, 889I had to include lines 2 and 3 to get it to work (which I found in a python ticket), as well as incorporate @Jabba\'s comment:The result:(Note: I am on Mac OS X 10.8.4 and using Python 2.7.3)For Python 3.XFor Python 2.XSome languages have combining diacritics as language letters and accent diacritics to specify accent.I think it is more safe to specify explicitly what diactrics you want to strip:
