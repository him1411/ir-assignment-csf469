In a project where some of the files contains ^M as newline separators. Diffing these files are apparently impossible, since git-diff sees it as the entire file is just a single line.How does one diff with the previous version?Is there an option like "treat ^M as newline when diffing" ?UPDATE:now I have written a script that checks out the latest 10 revisions and converts CR to LF.GitHub suggests that you should make sure to only use \\n as a newline character in git-handled repos. There\'s an option to auto-convert:Of course, this is said to convert crlf to lf, while you want to convert cr to lf. I hope this still works \xe2\x80\xa6And then convert your files:core.autocrlf is described on the man page.Developing on Windows, I ran into this problem when using git tfs.  I solved it this way:This basically tells Git that an end-of-line CR is not an error.  As a result, those annoying ^M characters no longer appear at the end of lines in git diff, git show, etc.It appears to leave other settings as-is; for instance, extra spaces at the end of a line still show as errors (highlighted in red) in the diff.(Other answers have alluded to this, but the above is exactly how to set the setting.  To set the setting for only one project, omit the --global.)EDIT:After many line-ending travails, I\'ve had the best luck, when working on a .NET team, with these settings:If you need to use the whitespace setting, you should probably enable it only on a per-project basis if you need to interact with TFS.  Just omit the --global:If you need to remove some core.* settings, the easiest way is to run this command:This opens your global .gitconfig file in a text editor, and you can easily delete the lines you want to remove.  (Or you can put \'#\' in front of them to comment them out.)Also see:or equivalently,where whitespace is preceded by a tab character.Try git diff --ignore-space-at-eol, or git diff --ignore-space-change, or git diff --ignore-all-space.In my case I was working on a project which was developed in Windows and I used OS X. When I changed some code, I saw ^M at the end of the lines I added in git diff. I think the ^M were showing up because they were different line endings than the rest of the file. Because the rest of the file was developed in Windows it used CR line endings, and in OS X it uses LF line endings.Apparently, the Windows developer didn\'t use the option "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" during the installation of Git.You can have the Windows users reinstall git and use the "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" option. This is what I would prefer, because I see Windows as an exception in it\'s line ending characters and Windows fixes it\'s own issue this way.If you go for this option, you should however fix the current files (because they\'re still using the CR line endings). I did this by following these steps:Remove all files from the repository, but not from your filesystem.Add a .gitattributes file that enforces certain files to use a LF as line endings. Put this in the file:Replace .ext with the file extensions you want to match.Add all the files again.This will show messages like this:You could remove the .gitattributes file unless you have stubborn Windows users that don\'t want to use the "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" option.Commit and push it all.Remove and checkout the applicable files on all the systems where they\'re used. On the Windows systems, make sure they now use the "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" option. You should also do this on the system where you executed these tasks because when you added the files git said:You can do something like this to remove the files:And then this to get them back with the correct line endings:Of course replacing .ext with the extension you want.Now your project only uses LF characters for the line endings, and the nasty CR characters won\'t ever come back :).The other option is to enforce windows style line endings. You can also use the .gitattributes file for this.More info:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/#platform-allI struggled with this problem for a long time. By far the easiest solution is to not worry about the ^M characters and just use a visual diff tool that can handle them.Instead of typing:try:If you are using Eclipse, you can make the ^M disappear from git diff by setting File > Convert Line Delimiter To > Unix (LF, \\n, 0A, \xc2\xb6)TL;DRChange the core.pager to "tr -d \'\\r\' | less -REX", not the source codeThis is whyThose pesky ^M shown are an artifact of the colorization and the pager. \nIt is caused by less -R, a default git pager option. (git\'s default pager is less -REX)The first thing to note is that git diff -b will not show changes in white space (e.g. the \\r\\n vs \\n)setup:A quick test to create a unix file and change the line endings will show no changes with git diff -b:We note that forcing a pipe to less does not show the ^M, but enabling color and less -R does:The fix is shown by using a pipe to strip the \\r (^M) from the output:An unwise alternative is to use less -r, because it will pass through all control codes, not just the color codes.If you want to just edit your git config file directly, this is the entry to update/add:
