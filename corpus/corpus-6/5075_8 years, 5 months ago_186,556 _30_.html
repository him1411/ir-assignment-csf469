I\'d like to create a user in PostgreSQL that can only do SELECTs from a particular database. In MySQL the command would be:What is the equivalent command or series of commands in PostgreSQL?I tried...But it appears that the only things you can grant on a database are CREATE, CONNECT, TEMPORARY, and TEMP.If you only grant CONNECT to a database, the user can connect but has no other privileges. You have to grant USAGE on namespaces (schemas) and SELECT on tables and views individually like so:In the latest versions of PostgreSQL, you can grant permissions on all tables/views/etc in the schema using a single command rather than having to type them one by one:This only affects tables that have already been created. More powerfully, you can automatically have default roles assigned to new objects in future:Note that by default this will only affect objects (tables) created by the user that issued this command: although it can also be set on any role that the issuing user is a member of. However, you don\'t pick up default privileges for all roles you\'re a member of when creating new objects... so there\'s still some faffing around. If you adopt the approach that a database has an owning role, and schema changes are performed as that owning role, then you should assign default privileges to that owning role. IMHO this is all a bit confusing and you may need to experiment to come up with a functional workflow.To avoid errors in lengthy, multi-table changes, it is recommended to use the following \'automatic\' process to generate the required GRANT SELECT to each table/view:This should output the relevant GRANT commands to GRANT SELECT on all tables, views, and sequences in public, for copy-n-paste love. Naturally, this will only be applied to tables that have already been created.Do note that PostgreSQL 9.0 (today in beta testing) will have a simple way to do that:Here is the best way I\'ve found to add read-only users (using PostgreSQL 9.0 or newer):Then log in to all related machines (master + read-slave(s)/hot-standby(s), etc..) and run:I\xe2\x80\x99ve created a convenient script for that; pg_grant_read_to_db.sh. This script grants read-only privileges to a specified role on all tables, views and sequences in a database schema and sets them as default.By default new users will have permission to create tables. If you are planning to create a read-only user, this is probably not what you want.To create a true read-only user with PostgreSQL 9.0+, run the following steps:If your read-only user doesn\'t have permission to list tables (i.e. \\d returns no results), it\'s probably because you don\'t have USAGE permissions for the schema. USAGE is a permission that allows users to actually use the permissions they have been assigned. What\'s the point of this? I\'m not sure. To fix:Reference taken from this blog:Script to Create Read-Only user:Assign permission to this read only user:The not straightforward way of doing it would be granting select on each table of the database:You could automate that by generating your grant statements from the database metadata.If your database is in the public schema, it is easy (this assumes you have already created the readonlyuser)If your database is using customschema, execute the above but add one more command:Taken from a link posted in response to despesz\' link.Postgres 9.x appears to have the capability to do what is requested.  See the Grant On Database Objects paragraph of:http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/sql-grant.htmlWhere it says: "There is also an option to grant privileges on all objects of the same type within one or more schemas. This functionality is currently supported only for tables, sequences, and functions (but note that ALL TABLES is considered to include views and foreign tables)."This page also discusses use of ROLEs and a PRIVILEGE called "ALL PRIVILEGES".Also present is information about how GRANT functionalities compare to SQL standards.
