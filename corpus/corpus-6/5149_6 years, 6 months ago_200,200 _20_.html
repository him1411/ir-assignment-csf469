Is there a way to get a color-int from a color resource?\nI am trying to get the individual red, blue and green components of a color defined in the resource (R.color.myColor) so that I can set the values of three seekbars to a specific level.For more information on another use-case that may help surface this question in search results, I wanted to apply alpha to a color defined in my resources. Using @sat\'s correct answer:You can use:Check here on how to define custom colors:http://sree.cc/google/android/defining-custom-colors-using-xml-in-androidEDIT(1):\nSince getColor(int id) is deprecated now, this must be used :(added in support library 23)EDIT(2):Below code can be used for both pre and post Marshmallow (API 23)Based on the new Android Support Library (and this update), now you should call:ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.name.color);According to the documentation:This method was deprecated in API level 23.\nUse getColor(int, Theme) insteadIt is the same solution for getResources().getColorStateList(id):You have to change it like this: ContextCompat.getColorStateList(getContext(),id);Here is a somewhat fuller example (and updated for API 24 and below) :values/color.xmlI updated to use ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.your_color); but sometimes (On some devices/Android versions. I\'m not sure) that causes a NullPointerExcepiton.So to make it work on all devices/versions, I fall back on the old way of doing it, in the case of a null pointer.
