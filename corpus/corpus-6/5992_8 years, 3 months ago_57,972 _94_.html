What does the following code mean in Ruby?Does it have any meaning or reason for the syntax?This question has been discussed so often on the Ruby mailing-lists and Ruby blogs that there are now even threads on the Ruby mailing-list whose only purpose is to collect links to all the other threads on the Ruby mailing-list that discuss this issue.Here\'s one: The definitive list of ||= (OR Equal) threads and pagesIf you really want to know what is going on, take a look at Section 11.3.1.2 "Abbreviated assignments" of the Ruby Language Draft Specification.As a first approximation, is equivalent to and not equivalent to However, that is only a first approximation, especially if a is undefined. The semantics also differ depending on whether it is a simple variable assignment, a method assignment or an indexing assignment:are all treated differently.a ||= b is a "conditional assignment operator". It is sort-of-but-not-quite(*) shorthand for a || a = b.It means "if a is undefined or falsey (false or nil), then evaluate b and set a to the result".For example:Ruby\'s short circuit evaluation means that if a is defined and evaluates to true, then the right hand side of the operator is not evaluated, and no assignment takes place. This distinction is unimportant if a and b are both local variables, but is significant if either is a getter/setter method of a class.Confusingly, it looks similar to other assignment operators (such as +=) but behaves differently.a += b   →   a = a + ba ||= b   →   a || a = bThere are apparently nuances, exceptions, special cases - but that\'s the essence of it.As pointed out by ajedi32:a ||= b \xe2\x87\x94 a || a = b?The behavior of these statements differs when a is an undefined local variable. In that case, a ||= b will set a to b (and evaluate to b), whereas a || a = b will raise NameError: undefined local variable or method \'a\' for main:Object.Further reading:evaluates the same way as each of the following lines-On the other hand,evaluates the same way as each of the following lines-Edit: As AJedi32 pointed out in the comments, this only holds true if: 1. a is a defined variable. 2. Evaluating a one time and two times does not result in a difference in program or system state.In short, a||=b means: If a is undefined, nil or false, assign b to a. Otherwise, keep a intact.\nx ||= y means if x has any value leave it alone and do not change the value, otherwise\nset x to y.It means or-equals to. It checks to see if the value on the left is defined, then use that. If it\'s not, use the value on the right. You can use it in Rails to cache instance variables in models.A quick Rails-based example, where we create a function to fetch the currently logged in user:It checks to see if the @current_user instance variable is set. If it is, it will return it, thereby saving a database call. If it\'s not set however, we make the call and then set the @current_user variable to that. It\'s a really simple caching technique but is great for when you\'re fetching the same instance variable across the application multiple times.is"if x is false or undefined, then x point to y"To be precise, a ||= b means "if a is undefined or falsy (false or nil), set a to b and evaluate to (i.e. return) b, otherwise evaluate to a".Others often try to illustrate this by saying that a ||= b is equivalent to a || a = b or a = a || b. These equivalencies can be helpful for understanding the concept, but be aware that they are not accurate under all conditions. Allow me to explain:a ||= b \xe2\x87\x94 a || a = b?The behavior of these statements differs when a is an undefined local variable. In that case, a ||= b will set a to b (and evaluate to b), whereas a || a = b will raise NameError: undefined local variable or method \'a\' for main:Object.a ||= b \xe2\x87\x94 a = a || b?The equivalency of these statements are often assumed, since a similar equivalence is true for other abbreviated assignment operators (i.e. +=,-=,*=,/=,%=,**=,&=,|=,^=,<<=, and >>=). However, for ||= the behavior of these statements may differ when a= is a method on an object and a is truthy. In that case, a ||= b will do nothing (other than evaluate to a), whereas a = a || b will call a=(a) on a\'s receiver. As others have pointed out, this can make a difference when calling a=a has side effects, such as adding keys to a hash.a ||= b \xe2\x87\x94 a = b unless a??The behavior of these statements differs only in what they evaluate to when a is truthy. In that case, a = b unless a will evaluate to nil (though a will still not be set, as expected), whereas a ||= b will evaluate to a.a ||= b \xe2\x87\x94 defined?(a) ? (a || a = b) : (a = b)????Still no. These statements can differ when a method_missing method exists which returns a truthy value for a. In this case, a ||= b will evaluate to whatever method_missing returns, and not attempt to set a, whereas defined?(a) ? (a || a = b) : (a = b) will set a to b and evaluate to b.Okay, okay, so what is a ||= b equivalent to? Is there a way to express this in Ruby?Well, assuming that I\'m not overlooking anything, I believe a ||= b is functionally equivalent to... (drumroll)Hold on! Isn\'t that just the first example with a noop before it? Well, not quite. Remember how I said before that a ||= b is only not equivalent to a || a = b when a is an undefined local variable? Well, a = nil if false ensures that a is never undefined, even though that line is never executed. Local variables in Ruby are lexically scoped.unless x\n  x = y\nendunless x has a value (it\'s not nil or false), set it equal to yis equivalent to x ||= ySuppose  a = 2 and b = 3THEN, a ||= b  will be resulted to a\'s value i.e. 2.As when a evaluates to some value not resulted to false or nil.. That\'s why it ll not evaluate b\'s value.Now Suppose  a = nil and b = 3.Then a ||= b will be resulted to  3 i.e. b\'s value.As it first try to evaluates a\'s value which resulted to nil.. so it evaluated b\'s value.The best example used in ror app is :Where, User.find_by_id(session[:user_id]) is fired if and only if @current_user is not initialized before.is equivalent toand notbecause of the situation where you define a hash with a default (the hash will return the default for any undefined keys)if you use:a is still:but when you write it like so:a becomes:because you\'ve assigned the value of itself at key 10, which defaults to true, so now the hash is defined for the key 10, rather than never performing the assignment in the first place.It\'s like lazy instantiation.\nIf the variable is already defined it will take that value instead of creating the value again.This the default assignment notationfor example: x ||= 1 \nthis will check to see if x is nil or not. If x is indeed nil it will then assign it that new value (1 in our example)more explicit: \nif x == nil \nx = 1\nendBecause a was already set to 1Because a was nilThis translates to:which will beso finallyNow if you call this again:Now if you call this again:If you observe, b value will not be assigned to a. a will still have 5.Its a Memoization Pattern that is being used in Ruby to speed up accessors.This basically translates to:So you will make a call to database for the first time you call this method.Future calls to this method will just return the value of @users instance variable.Please also remember that ||= isn\'t an atomic operation and so, it isn\'t thread safe. As rule of thumb, don\'t use it for class methods.as a common misconception a||=b is not  equivalent to a = a||b  but it is  but it behaves like a || a = bBut here comes a tricky caseIf a is not defined, a || a = 42 raises NameError, while a ||= 42 returns 42. So, they don\'t seem to be equivalent expressions.        ||= is called a conditional assignment operator. It basically works as = but with the exception that if a variable has already been assigned it will do nothing. First example:Second example:In the first example x is now equal to 10. However, in the second example x is already defined as 20. So the conditional operator has no effect. x is still 20 after running x ||= 10.
