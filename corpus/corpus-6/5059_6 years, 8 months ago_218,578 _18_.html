I am writing a very simple script that calls another script, and I need to propagate the parameters from my current script to the script I am executing.For instance, my script name is foo.sh and calls bar.shfoo.sh:How can I do this without explicitly specifying each parameter?Use "$@" instead of plain $@ if you actually wish your parameters to be passed the same.Observe:For bash and other Bourne-like shells:Use "$@" (works for all POSIX compatibles).[...] , bash features the "$@" variable, which expands to all command-line parameters separated by spaces.From Bash by example.Just thought this may be a bit more useful when trying to test how args come into your scriptMy SUN Unix has a lot of limitations, even "$@" was not interpreted as desired. My workaround is ${@}.  For example,By the way, I had to have this particular script because my Unix also does not support grep -rWorks fine, except if you have spaces or escaped characters. I don\'t find the way to capture arguments in this case and send to a ssh inside of script.This could be useful but is so uglyI realize this has been well answered but here\'s a comparison between "$@" $@ "$*" and $*Contents of test script:Now, run the test script with various arguments:
