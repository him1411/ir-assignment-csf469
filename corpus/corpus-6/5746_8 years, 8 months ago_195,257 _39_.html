If you have  a circle with center (center_x, center_y) and radius radius, how do you test if a given point with coordinates (x, y) is inside the circle?In general, x and y must satisfy (x - center_x)^2 + (y - center_y)^2 < radius^2.Please note that points that satisfy the above equation with < replaced by == are considered the points on the circle, and the points that satisfy the above equation with < replaced by > are considered the outside the circle.Mathematically, Pythagoras is probably a simple method as many have already mentioned.Computationally, there are quicker ways. Define:If a point is more likely to be outside this circle then imagine a square drawn around it such that it\'s sides are tangents to this circle:  Now imagine a square diamond drawn inside this circle such that it\'s vertices touch this circle:Now we have covered most of our space and only a small area of this circle remains in between our square and diamond to be tested. Here we revert to Pythagoras as above.If a point is more likely to be inside this circle then reverse order of first 3 steps:Alternate methods imagine a square inside this circle instead of a diamond but this requires slightly more tests and calculations with no computational advantage (inner square and diamonds have identical areas):Update:For those interested in performance I implemented this method in c, and compiled with -O3.I obtained execution times by time ./a.outI implemented this method, a normal method and a dummy method to determine timing overhead.Normal: 21.3s\nThis: 19.1s\nOverhead: 16.5sSo, it seems this method is more efficient in this implementation.You can use Pythagoras to measure the distance between your point and the centre and see if it\'s lower than the radius:EDIT (hat tip to Paul)In practice, squaring is often much cheaper than taking the square root and since we\'re only interested in an ordering, we can of course forego taking the square root:Also, Jason noted that <= should be replaced by < and depending on usage this may actually make sense even though I believe that it\'s not true in the strict mathematical sense. I stand corrected.This is more efficient, and readable. It avoids the costly square root operation.  I also added a check to determine if the point is within the bounding rectangle of the circle.The rectangle check is unnecessary except with many points or many circles.  If most points are inside circles, the bounding rectangle check will actually make things slower!As always, be sure to consider your use case.Calculate the Distancethat\'s in C#...convert for use in python...You should check whether the distance from the center of the circle to the point is smaller than the radius, i.e.As said above -- use Euclidean distance.This is the same solution as mentioned by Jason Punyon, but it contains a pseudo-code example and some more details. I saw his answer after writing this, but I didn\'t want to remove mine.I think the most easily understandable way is to first calculate the distance between the circle\'s center and the point. I would use this formula:Then, simply compare the result of that formula, the distance (d), with the radius. If the distance (d) is less than or equal to the radius (r), the point is inside the circle (on the edge of the circle if d and r are equal).Here is a pseudo-code example which can easily be converted to any programming language:Where circle_x and circle_y is the center coordinates of the circle, r is the radius of the circle, and x and y is the coordinates of the point.Find the distance between the center of the circle and the the points given. If the distance between them is less than radius then the point is inside the circle.\nif the distance between them is equal to the radius of the circle then the point is on the circumference of the circle.\nif the distance is greater than the radius then the point is outside the circle.My answer in C# as a complete cut & paste (not optimized) solution:Usage:I used the code below for beginners like me :).public class incirkel {As stated previously, to show if the point is in the circle we can use the followingTo represent it graphically we can use:
