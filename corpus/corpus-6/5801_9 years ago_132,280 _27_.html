Can\'t find anything relevant about Entity Framework/MySQL on Google so I\'m hoping someone knows about it.It\'s been released - Get the MySQL connector for .Net v6.5 - this has support for\n    [Entity Framework]I was waiting for this the whole time, although the support is basic, works for most basic scenarios of db interaction. It also has basic Visual Studio integration.UPDATE\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/\nStarting with version 6.7, Connector/Net will no longer include the MySQL for Visual Studio integration. That functionality is now available in a separate product called MySQL for Visual Studio available using the MySQL Installer for Windows (see http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/mysql-installer-for-windows.html).Check out my post on this subject. http://pattersonc.com/blog/index.php/2009/04/01/using-mysql-with-entity-framework-and-aspnet-mvc-\xe2\x80\x93-part-i/MySQL is hosting a webinar about EF in a few days... \nLook here: http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/display-204.htmledit: That webinar is now at http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/on-demand-webinars/display-od-204.htmlThis isn\'t about MS and what they want.  They have created an *open system for others to plug-in \'providers\' - postgres and sqlite have it - mysql is just laggin...  but, good news for those interested, i too was looking for this and found that the MySql Connector/Net 6.0 will have it...  you can check it out here: http://www.upfromthesky.com/blog/post/2009/03/24/MySql-Supports-the-Entity-Framework.aspxYou would need a mapping provider for MySQL. That is an extra thing the Entity Framework needs to make the magic happen. This blog talks about other mapping providers besides the one Microsoft is supplying. I haven\'t found any mentionings of MySQL.Vintana,Od course there\'s something ready now. http://www.devart.com/products.html - it\'s commercial although (you have a 30days trial IIRC). They make a living writing providers, so I guess it should be fast and stable. I know really big companies using their Oracle provider instead of Orace and MS ones.This MySQL tutorial shows how to generate and use EF entities as a datasource for a control.You might also look at \nhttp://www.devart.com/They have commercial provider ($$) that supports EF.Be careful using connector .net, Connector 6.6.5 have a bug, it is not working for inserting tinyint values as identity, for example:if you try to insert an object like this:You will get a Null Reference Exception:Until now I haven\'t found a solution, I had to change my tinyint identity to unsigned int identity, this solved the problem but this is not the right solution.If you use an older version of Connector.net (I used 6.4.4) you won\'t have this problem.If someone knows about the solution, please contact me.Cheers!OwareI didn\'t see the link here, but there\'s a beta .NET Connector for MySql.  Click "Development Releases" to download 6.3.2 beta, which has EF4/VS2010 integration:http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/5.0.html#downloadsIf you interested in running Entity Framework with MySql on mono/linux/macos, this might be helpful \nhttps://iyalovoi.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/entity-framework-with-mysql-on-mac-os/
