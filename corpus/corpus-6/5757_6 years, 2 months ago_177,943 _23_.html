This question already has an answer here:I\'m looking for some good comprehensive reading material on when Javascript passes something by value and when by reference and when modifying a passed item affects the value outside a function and when not.  I\'m also interested in when assigning to another variable is by reference vs. by value and whether that follows any different rules than passing as a function parameter.I\'ve done a lot of searching and find lots of specific examples (many of them here on SO) from which I can start to piece together pieces of the real rules, but I haven\'t yet found a single, well written document that describes it all.Also, are there ways in the language to control whether something is passed by reference or by value?Here are some of the types of questions I want to understand.  These are just examples - I\'m actually looking to understand the rules the language goes by, not just the answers to specific examples.  But, here are some examples:When are the contents of x, y and z changed outside the scope of f for all the different types?If I want to make a fully independent copy of an object (no references whatsoever), what\'s the best practice way to do that?My understanding is that this is actually very simple:So, to work through some of  your examples:Example 2:Javascript always passes by value. However, if you pass an object to a function, the "value" is really a reference to that object, so the function can modify that object\'s properties but not cause the variable outside the function to point to some other object.An example:Yes, Javascript always passes by value, but in an array or object, the value is a reference to it, so you can \'change\' the contents.But, I think you already read it on SO; here you have the documentation you want:http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/javascript_passArray and Object is passed as  pass by reference or  pass by value based on these two condition.if you are changing value of that Object or array with new Object or Array then it is pass by Value.object1 = {item: "car"};\n  array1=[1,2,3];here you are assigning new object or array to old one.you are not changing the value of property \nof old object.so it is pass by value.if you are changing a property value of an object or array then it is pass by Reference.object1.item= "car";\n  array1[0]=9;here you are changing a property value of old object.you are not assigning new object or array to old one.so it is pass by reference.Code
