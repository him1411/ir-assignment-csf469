Say I have classes Foo and Bar set up like this:As annotated in the code, I\'d like to be able to call the base class\'s function that I\'m overriding. In Java there\'s the super.funcname() syntax. Is this possible in C++?The C++ syntax is like this:Yes,It is the same as super in Java, except it allows calling implementations from different bases when you have multiple inheritance.Sometimes you need to call the base class\' implementation, when you aren\'t in the derived function...It still works:Just in case you do this for a lot of functions in your class:This might save a bit of writing if you want to rename Foo.If you want to call a function of base class from its derived class you can simply call inside the overridden function with mentioning base class name(like Foo::printStuff()).code goes hereAgain you can determine at runtime which function to call using the object of that class(derived or base).But this requires your function at base class must be marked as virtual.code belowcheck this...outputthe best way is using the base::function as say @sth
