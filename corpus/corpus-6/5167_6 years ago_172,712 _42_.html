Is there a way to get a list of all installed color schemes in Vim? That would make very easy to select one without looking at the .vim directory.Type :colorscheme then Space followed by TAB.or as Peter said,:colorscheme then Space followed by CTRLdThe short version of the command is :colo so you can use it in the two previous commands, instead of using the "long form".If you want to find and preview more themes, there are various websites like Vim colorsYou can see the list of color schemes under /usr/share/vim/vimNN/colors (with NN being the version, e.g. vim74 for vim 7.4).This is explained here.On the linux servers I use via ssh, TAB prints ^I and CTRLd prints ^D.If you are willing to install a plugin, I recommend https://github.com/vim-scripts/CycleColor. to cycle through all installed colorschemes. Nice way to easily choose a colorscheme.If you have your vim compiled with +menu, you can follow menus with the :help of console-menu. From there, you can navigate to Edit.Color\\ Scheme to get the same list as with in gvim.Other method is to use a cool script ScrollColors that previews the colorschemes while you scroll the schemes with j/k.Here is a small function I wrote to try all the colorschemes in $VIMRUNTIME/colors directory. Add the below function to your vimrc, then open your source file and call the function from command.A great solution, and my thanks to your contributors. For years I\'ve been struggling with a totally crappy color scheme -- using SSH under Windows Vista to a Redhat system, terminal type xterm.\nThe editor would come up with a black background and weird colors for various keywords. \nWorse -- that weird color scheme sticks in the xterm terminal after leaving Vim.Really confusing.Also, Backspace failed during an insert mode, which was nasty to remember -- though Delete did the same thing.The cure --In the SSH monitor, select Edit/Settings.a. Choose Profile Settings/Colorsb. check \'enable ANSI colors\'c. The standard Text colors are probably OKAdd these lines to $HOME/.vimrc:colorscheme defaultif &term == "xterm"set t_kb=^HfixdelendifNOTE: the ^H MUST be typed as ctrl-V ctrl-H.  Seems peculiar, but this seems to work.Try in your ~/.vimrc. The first two lines make possible matches appear as lists. You can use either or both. The fourth line makes leader , instead of the default \\. The last line allows you to simply type ,c to get a list and a prompt to change your colorscheme. The third line effectively allows for Tabs to appear in key maps. (Of course, all of these strategies I\'ve learned from the internet, and mostly SO, very recently.) Looking at my system\'s menu.vim (look for \'Color Scheme submenu\') and @chappar\'s answer, I came up with the following function:It does the following:Then to use the function I do something like this:Which means I prefer the \'solarized\' and then the \'darkblue\' schemes; if none of them is available, do nothing.
