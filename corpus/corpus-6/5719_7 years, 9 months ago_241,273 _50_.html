How can I change the time alone in DateTime variable?I need to the change only the time part in s.You can\'t change a DateTime value - it\'s immutable. However, you can change the variable to have a new value. The easiest way of doing that to change just the time is to create a TimeSpan with the relevant time, and use the DateTime.Date property:s will now be the same date, but at 10.30am.Note that DateTime disregards daylight saving time transitions, representing "naive" Gregorian time in both directions (see Remarks section in the DateTime docs). The only exceptions are .Now and .Today: they retrieve current system time which reflects these events as they occur.This is the kind of thing which motivated me to start the Noda Time project, which is now production-ready. Its ZonedDateTime type is made "aware" by linking it to a tz database entry.Alright I\'m diving in with my suggestion, an extension method:Then call:It\'s important to note that this extension returns a new date object, so you can\'t do this:But you can do this:In this way you preserve your date, while inserting a new hours, minutes and seconds part to your liking.DateTime is an immutable type, so you can\'t change it.However, you can create a new DateTime instance based on your previous instance. In your case, it sounds like you need the Date property, and you can then add a TimeSpan that represents the time of day.Something like this:one linerwould bring back todays date with a time of 4:30:00, replace DateTime.Now with any date objectIf you already have the time stored in another DateTime object you can use the Add method.\nThe TimeOfDay property is a TimeSpan object and can be passed to the Add method. And since we use the Date property of the dateToUse variable we get just the date and add the time span.Happened upon this post as I was looking for the same functionality this could possibly do what the guy wanted. Take the original date and replace the time partExecuted:\n    Today = 9/04/15 00:00:00If you have a DateTime like 2014/02/05 18:19:51 and want just 2014/02/05, you can do that:Use Date.Add and add a New TimeSpan with the new time you want to addAdding .Date to your date sets it to midnight (00:00).Note The equivavalent SQL is CONVERT(DATETIME, CONVERT(DATE, @MyDate))What makes this method so good is that it\'s both quick to type and easy to read. A bonus is that there is no conversion from strings.I.e. To set today\'s date to 23:30, use:You can of course replace DateTime.Now or MyDate with any date of your choice.Here is a method you could use to do it for you, use it like thisHere is the method, there is probably a better way, but I just whipped this up:I have just come across this post because I had a similar issue whereby I wanted to set the time for an Entity Framework object in MVC that gets the date from a view (datepicker) so the time component is 00:00:00 but I need it to be the current time. Based on the answers in this post I came up with:What\'s wrong with DateTime.AddSeconds method where you can add or substract seconds?When you construct your DateTime object, use a constructor that allows you to specify time:If you already have a DateTime object and wish to change the time, uou can add minutes, hours or seconds to your DateTime using simple methods:Notice how we have to "save" the result from each method call to the myDateTime variable. This is because the DateTime is immutable, and its methods simply create new instances with the extra hours/minutes/seconds added.If you need to add both hours and minutes (and/or seconds) and the same time, you can simplify the code by adding a TimeSpan to the original DateTime instead:If you want to set absolute hours/minues/seconds, rather than adding to the existing values, you can use the aforementioned DateTime constructor, and reuse values for year/month/day from earlier:Doesn\'t that fix your problems??I prefer this:Use like this:Console.WriteLine (DateTime.Now.ClearTimeFrom(eTimeFragment.hours))this has to return:\n2016-06-06 00:00:00.000Since DateTime is immutable, a new instance has to be created when a date component needs to be changed. Unfortunately, there is no built-in functionality to set individual components of a DateTime instance.Using the following extension methodsyou can set individual DateTime components likeSimplest solution :And if you need a specific Date and Time Format :you could add +ve/-ve values in parameter.The best solution is:Try this onehere is a ghetto way, but it works :)
