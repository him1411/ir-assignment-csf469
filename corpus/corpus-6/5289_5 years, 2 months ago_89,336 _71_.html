My question is similar to this:ASP.NET MVC 4 Minification & Background ImagesExcept that I want to stick with MVC\'s own bundling if I can. I\'m having a brain crash trying to figure out what the correct pattern is for specifying style bundles such that standalone css and image sets such as jQuery UI work.I have a typical MVC site structure with /Content/css/ which contains my base CSS such as styles.css. Within that css folder I also have subfolders such as /jquery-ui which contains its CSS file plus an /images folder. Image paths in the jQuery UI CSS are relative to that folder and I don\'t want to mess with them.As I understand it, when I specify a StyleBundle I need to specify a virtual path which does not also match a real content path, because (assuming I\'m ignoring routes to Content) IIS would then try to resolve that path as a physical file. So I\'m specifying:rendered using:I can see the request going out to:This is returning the correct, minified CSS response. \nBut then the browser sends a request for a relatively linked image as:Which is a 404.I understand that the last part of my URL jquery-ui is an extensionless URL, a handler for my bundle, so I can see why the relative request for the image is simply /styles/images/. So my question is what is the correct way of handling this situation? According to this thread on MVC4 css bundling and image references, if you define your bundle as:Where you define the bundle on the same path as the source files that made up the bundle, the relative image paths will still work. The last part of the bundle path is really the file name for that specific bundle (i.e., /bundle can be any name you like).This will only work if you are bundling together CSS from the same folder (which I think makes sense from a bundling perspective).UpdateAs per the comment below by @Hao Kung, alternatively this may now be achieved by applying a CssRewriteUrlTransformation (Change relative URL references to CSS files when bundled). NOTE: I have not confirmed comments regarding issues with rewriting to absolute paths within a virtual directory, so this may not work for everyone (?).Grinn / ThePirat solution works well. I did not like that it new\'d the Include method on bundle, and that it created temporary files in the content directory.  (they ended up getting checked in, deployed, then the service wouldn\'t start!)So to follow the design of Bundling, I elected to perform essentially the same code, but in an IBundleTransform implementation::And then wrapped this up in a Bundle Implemetation:Sample Usage:Here is my extension method for RelativeFromAbsolutePath:Better yet (IMHO) implement a custom Bundle that fixes the image paths. I wrote one for my app. ...To use it, do:...instead of...What it does is (when not in debug mode) looks for url(<something>) and replaces it with url(<absolute\\path\\to\\something>). I wrote the thing about 10 seconds ago so it might need a little tweaking. I\'ve taken into account fully-qualified URLs and base64 DataURIs by making sure there\'s no colons (:) in the URL path. In our environment, images normally reside in the same folder as their css files, but I\'ve tested it with both parent folders (url(../someFile.png)) and child folders (url(someFolder/someFile.png).It is not necessary to specify a transform or have crazy subdirectory paths. After much troubleshooting I isolated it to this "simple" rule (is it a bug?)...If your bundle path does not start with relative root of the items being included, then the web application root will not be taken into account.Sounds like more of a bug to me, but anyway that\'s how you fix it with the current .NET 4.51 version. Perhaps the other answers were necessary on older ASP.NET builds, can\'t say don\'t have time to retrospectively test all that.To clarify, here is an example:I have these files...Then setup the bundle like...And render it like...And get the "behaviour" (bug), the CSS files themselves have the application root (e.g. "http://localhost:1234/MySite/Content/Site.css") but the CSS image within all start "/Content/Images/..." or "/Images/..." depending on whether I add the transform or not.Even tried creating the "Bundles" folder to see if it was to do with the path existing or not, but that didn\'t change anything. The solution to the problem is really the requirement that the name of the bundle must start with the path root.Meaning this example is fixed by registering and rendering the bundle path like..So of course you could say this is RTFM, but I am quite sure me and others picked-up this "~/Bundles/..." path from the default template or somewhere in documentation at MSDN or ASP.NET web site, or just stumbled upon it because actually it\'s a quite logical name for a virtual path and makes sense to choose such virtual paths which do not conflict with real directories.Anyway, that\'s the way it is. Microsoft see no bug. I don\'t agree with this, either it should work as expected or some exception should be thrown, or an additional override to adding the bundle path which opts to include the application root or not. I can\'t imagine why anyone would not want the application root included when there was one (normally unless you installed your web site with a DNS alias/default web site root). So actually that should be the default anyway.Although Chris Baxter\'s answer helps with original problem, it doesn\'t work in my case when application is hosted in virtual directory. After investigating the options, I finished with DIY solution.ProperStyleBundle class includes code borrowed from original CssRewriteUrlTransform to properly transform relative paths within virtual directory. It also throws if file doesn\'t exist and prevents reordering of files in the bundle (code taken from BetterStyleBundle).Use it like StyleBundle:I found that CssRewriteUrlTransform fails to run if you\'re referencing a *.css file and you have the associated *.min.css file in the same folder. To fix this, either delete the *.min.css file or reference it directly in your bundle:After that you do that, your URLs will be transformed correctly and your images should be correctly resolved.As of v1.1.0-alpha1 (pre release package) the framework uses the VirtualPathProvider to access files rather than touching the physical file system.The updated transformer can be seen below:Here is a Bundle Transform that will replace css urls with urls relative to that css file. Just add it to your bundle and it should fix the issue.Maybe I am biased, but I quite like my solution as it doesn\'t do any transforming, regex\'s etc and it\'s has the least amount of code :)This works for a site hosted as a Virtual Directory in a IIS Web Site and as a root website on IISSo I created an Implentation of IItemTransform encapsulated the CssRewriteUrlTransform and used VirtualPathUtility to fix the path and call the existing code:Seems to work fine for me?Another option would be to use the IIS URL Rewrite module to map the virtual bundle image folder to the physical image folder.  Below is an example of a rewrite rule from that you could use for a bundle called "~/bundles/yourpage/styles" - note the regex matches on alphanumeric characters as well as hyphens, underscores and periods, which are common in image file names.This approach creates a little extra overhead, but allows you to have more control over your bundle names, and also reduces the number of bundles you may have to reference on one page.  Of course, if you have to reference multiple 3rd party css files that contain relative image path references, you still can\'t get around creating multiple bundles.Grinn solution is great.However it doesn\'t work for me when there are parent folder relative references in the url.\ni.e. url(\'../../images/car.png\') So, I slightly changed the Include method in order to resolve the paths for each regex match, allowing relative paths and also to optionally embed the images in the css.I also changed the IF DEBUG to check BundleTable.EnableOptimizations instead of HttpContext.Current.IsDebuggingEnabled.Hope it helps, regards.You can simply add another level of depth to your virtual bundle pathThis is a super low-tech answer and kind of a hack but it works and won\'t require any pre-processing.  Given the length and complexity of some of these answers I prefer doing it this way.  I had this problem with bundles having incorrect path\'s to images and CssRewriteUrlTransform not resolving relative parent paths .. correctly (there was also problem with external resources like webfonts). That\'s why I wrote this custom transform (appears to do all of the above correctly):Edit: I didn\'t realize it, but I used some custom extension methods in the code. The source code of those is:Of course it should be possible to replace String.StartsWith(char) with String.StartsWith(string).After little investigation I concluded the followings:\nYou have 2 options:go with transformations. Very usefull package for this: https://bundletransformer.codeplex.com/\nyou need following transformation for every problematic bundle:Advantages: of this solution, you can name your bundle whatever you want => you can combine css files into one bundle from different directories. \nDisadvantages: You need to transform every problematic bundleCssRewriteUrlTransform fixed my problem. \nIf your code still not loading images after using CssRewriteUrlTransform, then\nchange your css filename\'s from:To:Someway .(dots) are not recognizing in url.
