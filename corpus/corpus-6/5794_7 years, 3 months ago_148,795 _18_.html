This question already has an answer here:I was looking over some code the other day and I came across:Coming from C++, I had no idea why that was there. Its not an error because the code compiled fine. What is this "static" block of code?It\'s a static initializer. It\'s executed when the class is loaded (or initialized, to be precise, but you usually don\'t notice the difference).It can be thought of as a "class constructor".Note that there are also instance initializers, which look the same, except that they don\'t have the static keyword. Those are run in addition to the code in the constructor when a new instance of the object is created.It is a static initializer. It\'s executed when the class is loaded and a good place to put initialization of static variables.From http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/initial.htmlA class can have any number of static initialization blocks, and they can appear anywhere in the class body. The runtime system guarantees that static initialization blocks are called in the order that they appear in the source code. If you have a class with a static look-up map it could look like thisIt\'s useful since the above static field could not have been initialized using labels = .... It needs to call the put-method somehow.It\'s a block of code which is executed when the class gets loaded by a classloader. It is meant to do initialization of static members of the class.It is also possible to write non-static initializers, which look even stranger:Static block can be used to show that a program can run without main function also.A static block executes once in the life cycle of any program, \nanother property of static block is that it executes before the main method.Static blocks are used for initializaing the code and  will be executed when JVM loads the class.Refer to the below link which gives the detailed explanation.\nhttp://www.jusfortechies.com/java/core-java/static-blocks.phpyes, static block is used for initialize the code and it will load at the time JVM start for execution.static block is used in previous versions of java but in latest version it doesn\'t work.
