I can\'t wrap my mind around this quirk.I know [1,2,3] + [1,2] = "1,2,31,2", but I can\'t find what type or operation is being performed.The second [...] cannot be an array, so it\xe2\x80\x99s an array subscript operation. And the contents of a subscript operation are not a delimited list of operands, but a single expression.Read more about the comma operator here.Because (1,2) == 2.  You\'ve stumbled across the comma operator (or simpler explanation here).Unless commas appear in a declaration list, parameter list, object or array literal, they act like any other binary operator.  x, y evaluates x, then evaluates y and yields that as the result.Here the second box i.e. [1,2,3] becomes [3] i.e. the last item so the result will be 4\nfor example if you keep [1,2,3,4,5,6] in an array similarly But when you place a + operator in between then the second square bracket is not for mentioning index. It is rather another array\nThat\'s why you geti.e. Basically in the first case it is used as index of array and in the second case it is itself an array.The second array is a pointer to the first array. It will get value for each item in the first array. For example: lets call \nfirstArray = ["a","b","c","d","e"] the second array will first point b because firstArray[1] = "b". Then the second pointer will point at c because of firstArray[2] = "c". Then the last pointer will point at d because of firstArray[3] = "d". Therefore, it takes the final value, which is "d". You can look at it this way: Or if you change your sequence like this
