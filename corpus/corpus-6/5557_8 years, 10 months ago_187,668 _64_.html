I am trying to write a C++ program that takes the following inputs from the user to construct rectangles (between 2 and 5): height, width, x-pos, y-pos. All of these rectangles will exist parallel to the x and the y axis, that is all of their edges will have slopes of 0 or infinity.I\'ve tried to implement what is mentioned in this question but I am not having very much luck.My current implementation does the following:However I\'m not quite sure if (a) I\'ve implemented the algorithm I linked to correctly, or if I did exactly how to interpret this?Any suggestions?or, using Cartesian coordinates     (With X1 being left coord, X2 being right coord, increasing from left to right and   Y1 being Top coord, and Y2 being Bottom coord, increasing from bottom to top) ...NOTE: TO ALL SO USERS WITH EDIT AUTHORITY.  PLEASE STOP FIDDLING WITH THIS.Say you have Rect A, and Rect B. \nProof is by contradiction. Any one of four conditions guarantees that no overlap can exist:So condition for Non-Overlap is Therefore, a sufficient condition for Overlap is the opposite.  De Morgan\'s law says\nNot (A or B or C or D) is the same as Not A And Not B And Not C And Not D\nso using De Morgan, we haveThis is equivalent to:Note 1:  It is fairly obvious this same principle can be extended to any number of dimensions.\nNote 2:  It should also be fairly obvious to count overlaps of just one pixel, change the < and/or the > on that boundary to a <= or a >=.\nNote 3: This answer, when utilizing Cartesian coordinates (X, Y) is based on standard algebraic Cartesian coordinates (x increases left to right, and Y increases bottom to top). Obviously, where a computer system might mechanize screen coordinates differently, (e.g., increasing Y from top to bottom, or X From right to left), the syntax will need to be adjusted accordingly/ It is easier to check if a rectangle is completly outside the other, so if it is either on the left... or on the right... or on top... or on the bottom... of the second rectangle, it cannot possibly collide with it. So to have a function that returns a Boolean saying weather the rectangles collide, we simply combine the conditions by logical ORs and negate the result:To already receive a positive result when touching only, we can change the "<" and ">" by "<=" and ">=".Ask yourself the opposite question: How can I determine if two rectangles do not intersect at all?  Obviously, a rectangle A completely to the left of rectangle B does not intersect.  Also if A is completely to the right.  And similarly if A is completely above B or completely below B.  In any other case A and B intersect.What follows may have bugs, but I am pretty confident about the algorithm:Here\'s how it\'s done in the Java API:Suppose that you have defined the positions and sizes of the rectangles like this:My C++ implementation is like this:An example function call according to the given figure above:The comparisons inside the if block will look like below:In the question, you link to the maths for when rectangles are at arbitrary angles of rotation.  If I understand the bit about angles in the question however, I interpret that all rectangles are perpendicular to one another.A general knowing the area of overlap formula is:Using the example:1) collect all the x coordinates (both left and right) into a list, then sort it and remove duplicates2) collect all the y coordinates (both top and bottom) into a list, then sort it and remove duplicates3) create a 2D array by number of gaps between the unique x coordinates * number of gaps between the unique y coordinates.4) paint all the rectangles into this grid, incrementing the count of each cell it occurs over:5) As you paint the rectangles, its easy to intercept the overlaps.Easiest way isfirst of all put it in to your mind that in computers the coordinates system is upside down. x-axis is same as in mathematics but y-axis increases downwards and decrease on going upward..\nif rectangle are drawn from center.\nif x1 coordinates is greater than x2 plus its its half of widht.  then it means going half they will touch each other. and in the same manner going downward + half of its height. it will collide..I have implemented a C# version, it is easily converted to C++.Don\'t think of coordinates as indicating where pixels are. Think of them as being between the pixels. That way, the area of a 2x2 rectangle should be 4, not 9.Lets say the two rectangles are rectangle A and rectangle B. Let there centers be A1 and B1 (coordinates of A1 and B1 can be easily found out), let the heights be Ha and Hb, width be Wa and Wb, let dx be the width(x) distance between A1 and B1 and dy be the height(y) distance between A1 and B1.\nNow we can say we can say A and B overlap: when\n\nif(!(dx > Wa+Wb)||!(dy > Ha+Hb)) returns trueI have a very easy solutionlet x1,y1 x2,y2 ,l1,b1,l2,be cordinates and lengths and breadths of them respectivelyconsider the condition ((x2\n\nnow the only way these rectangle will overlap is if the point diagonal to x1,y1 will lie inside the other rectangle or similarly the point diagonal to x2,y2 will lie inside the other rectangle. which is exactly the above condition implies.A and B be two rectangle. C be their covering rectangle. It takes care all possible cases.This is from exercise 3.28 from the book Introduction to Java Programming- Comprehensive Edition. The code tests whether the two rectangles are indenticle, whether one is inside the other and whether one is outside the other. If none of these condition are met then the two overlap.**3.28 (Geometry: two rectangles) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the \ncenter x-, y-coordinates, width, and height of two rectangles and determines \nwhether the second rectangle is inside the first or overlaps with the first, as shown \nin Figure\xc2\xa03.9. Test your program to cover all cases.\nHere are the sample runs:Enter r1\'s center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 2.5 4 2.5 43\nEnter r2\'s center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1.5 5 0.5 3\nr2 is inside r1 Enter r1\'s center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1 2 3 5.5\nEnter r2\'s center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 3 4 4.5 5\nr2 overlaps r1Enter r1\'s center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1 2 3 3\nEnter r2\'s center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 40 45 3 2\nr2 does not overlap r1Java code to figure out if Rectangles are contacting or overlapping each other\n......For those of you who are using center points and half sizes for their rectangle data, instead of the typical x,y,w,h, or x0,y0,x1,x1, here\'s how you can do it:"If you perform subtraction x or y coordinates corresponding to the vertices of the two facing each rectangle, if the results are the same sign, the two rectangle do not overlap axes that" (i am sorry, i am not sure my translation is correct)Source: http://www.ieev.org/2009/05/kiem-tra-hai-hinh-chu-nhat-chong-nhau.htmlThis answer should be the top answer:if the rectangles overlap then the overlap area will be greater than zero. Now let us find the overlap area:if they overlap then the left edge of overlap-rect will be the max(r1.x1,r2.x1) and right edge will be min(r1.x2,r2.x2). so the length of the overlap will be min(r1.x2,r2.x2)-max(r1.x1,r2.x1)so the area will be: area = (max(r1.x1, r2.x1) - min(r1.x2, r2.x2)) * (max(r1.y1, r2.y1) - min(r1.y2, r2.y2))if area = 0 then they dont overlap. Simple isn\'t it?
