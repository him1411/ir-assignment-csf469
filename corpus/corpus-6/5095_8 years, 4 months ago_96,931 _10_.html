When I ssh into my ubuntu-box running Hardy 8.04, the environment variables in my .bashrc are not set.If I do a source .bashrc, the variables are properly set, and all is well.How come .bashrc isn\'t run at login?.bashrc is not sourced when you log in using SSH. You need to source it in your .bash_profile like this:I had similar situation like Hobhouse. I wanted to use command and \'some_command\' exists in \'/var/some_location\' \nso I tried to append \'/var/some_location\' in PATH environment \nby editing \'$HOME/.bashrc\'but that wasn\'t working. because default .bashrc(Ubuntu 10.4 LTS) prevent from sourcing by code like belowso If you want to change environment for ssh non-login shell.\nyou should add code above that line.For an excellent resource on how bash invocation works, what dotfiles do what, and how you should use/configure them, read this:If ayman\'s solution doesn\'t work, try naming your file .profile instead of .bash_profile. That worked for me.
