I am trying to append a string to a log file. However writeFile will erase the content each time before writing the string.Any idea how to do this the easy way?DanielAsynchronously:Synchronously:Your code using createWriteStream creates a file descriptor for every write. log.end is better because it asks node to close immediatelly after the write.You need to open it, then write to it.Here\'s a few links that will help explain the parameters  open\nwrite\ncloseEDIT: This answer is no longer valid, look into the new fs.appendFile method for appending.Node 0.8 has fs.appendFile:Docs: http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_fs_appendfile_filename_data_encoding_utf8_callbackBesides appendFile, you can also pass a flag in writeFile to append data to an existing file.By passing flag \'a\', data will be appended at the end of the file.When you want to write in a log file, i.e. appending data to the end of a file, never uses appendFile, appendFile opens a file handle to each data you add to your file and after some openings, you get an beautiful EMFILE.I can add that Appendfile is not easier to use than a WriteStream.Example with appendFile:Up to 8000 on my computer, you can append data to the file, then you obtain this:Moreover Appendfile will write when it is enable, so your logs will not be written by timestamp.\nYou can test with example, set 1000 in place of 100000, order will be random, depends on access to file.If you want to append to a file, you must use a writable stream like this:You ends it when you want. You are not even required to use stream.end(), default option is AutoClose:true, so your file will end when your process ends and you avoid opening too many files.Here\'s a full script. Fill in your file names and run it and it should work!\nHere\'s a video tutorial on the logic behind the script. I offer this suggestion only because control over open flags is sometimes useful, for example, you may want to truncate it an existing file first and then append a series of writes to it - in which case use the \'w\' flag when opening the file and don\'t close it until all the writes are done. Of course appendFile may be what you\'re after :-)Using jfile package :
