I\'m developing a web page in which I\'m using Twitter\'s Bootstrap Framework and their Bootstrap Tabs JS. It works great except for a few minor issues, one of which is I do not know how go directly to  a specific tab from an external link. For example:should go to the Home tab and the Notes tab respectively when clicked on the links from an external pageHere is my solution to the problem, a bit late perhaps. But it could maybe help others:UPDATEFor Bootstrap 3, change .on(\'shown\', ...) to .on(\'shown.bs.tab\', ....)This is based off of @dubbe answer and this SO accepted answer.  It handles the issue with window.scrollTo(0,0) not working correctly. The problem is that when you replace the url hash on tab shown, the browser will scroll to that hash since its an element on the page. To get around this, add a prefix so the hash doesn\'t reference an actual page elementExample of useIf you have tab-pane with id="mytab" you need to put your link like this:you could trigger a click event on the corresponding tab link:This is an improved implementation of dubbe\'s solution which prevent scrolling.While the JavaScript solution provided may work, I went a slightly different way that requires no additional JavaScript, but does require logic in your view.  You create a link with a standard URL parameter, like:Then you simply detect the value of activeTab to write \'class="active"\' in the appropriate <li>Pseudocode (implement accordingly in your language).  Note I\'ve set \'home\' tab as a default active if no parameter provided in this example.For Bootstrap 3:https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/6638/This works in Bootstrap 3 and improves dubbe and flynfish \'s 2 top answers by integrating GarciaWebDev \'s answer as well (which allows for url parameters after the hash and is straight from Bootstrap authors on the github issue tracker):I am not a big fan of if...else; so I took a simpler approach.Doesn\'t address scrolling to requested hash; but should it?This code selects the right tab depending on the #hash and adds the right #hash when a tab is clicked. (this uses jquery)In Coffeescript :or in JS :@flynfish + @Ztyx solution that I use for nested tabs:childrens should have class="nested"This code from http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2415#issuecomment-4450768 worked for me perfectly.I would suggest you use the code provided by Bootstrap authors on their issue tracker on GitHub:You can find on the link to the issue more information about why they didn\'t choose to support that.Here is what i did, really simple, and provided your tab links have an ID associated with them you can get the href attribute and pass that over to the function that shows the tab contents:Then in your url you can add the hash as something like: #tab_tab1, the \'tab_\' part is removed from the hash itself so the ID of the actual tab link in the nav-tabs (tabid1) is placed after this, so your url would look something like: www.mydomain.com/index.php#tab_tabid1.This works perfect for me and hope it helps someone else :-)Building on Demircan Celebi\'s solution; I wanted the tab to open when modifying the url and open tab without having to reload the page from the server.Thanks for sharing your views.By reading all the solutions. I came up with a solution that uses the url hash or localStorage depending on the availability of the latter with below code:This is my solution to handle nested tabs. \nI just added a function to check if the active tab has a parent tab to be activated.\nThis is the function:And can be called like this (Based on @flynfish\'s solution):This solution works pretty fine to me at the moment.\nHope this can be useful for someone else ;)I had to modify some bits for this to work for me.\nI am using Bootstrap 3 and jQuery 2Tried couple of ways discussed above and end up with following working solution, just copy and paste in your editor to try. To test just change hash to inbox, outbox, compose in url and hit enter key.Hope this will save your time.I just had this issue, but needed to handle multiple tab levels. The code is rather ugly (see comments), but does its job: https://gist.github.com/JensRantil/4721860 Hopefully someone else will find it useful (and feel free to propose better solutions!).Combining peices from other answers, here is a solution that can open many levels of nested tabs:
