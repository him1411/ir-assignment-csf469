How can I customize a scroll bar via CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for one div and not the whole page?I thought it would be helpful to consolidate the latest information on scroll bars, CSS, and browser compatibility. Currently, there exists no cross-browser scroll bar CSS styling definitions. The W3C article I mention at the end has the following statement and was recently updated (Fri 10 Oct 2014 03:09:48 PM CEST):Some browsers (IE, Konqueror) support the non-standard properties\n  \'scrollbar-shadow-color\', \'scrollbar-track-color\' and others. These\n  properties are illegal: they are neither defined in any CSS\n  specification nor are they marked as proprietary (by prefixing them\n  with "-vendor-")As others have mentioned, Microsoft supports scroll bar styling (example) but, only for IE8 and above.Example:Similarly, webkit now has its own version:From Custom Scrollbars in WebKit, relevant CSS:Firefox does not have its own version of scroll bar styles according to this SO answer from Custom CSS Scrollbar for Firefox.There\'s no Gecko equivalent to ::-webkit-scrollbar and friends.You\'ll have to stick with jQuery.Plenty of people would like this feature, see:\n  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77790This report is asking for the exact same thing you\'re asking for:\n  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=547260JavaScript libraries and plug-ins can provide a cross-browser solution.

I am sure you will be able to find something that will fit your needs.Just in case you want to prevent scroll bar styling that hasn\'t been properly prefixed with "-vendor", this article over at W3C provides some basic instructions. Basically, you\'ll need to add the following CSS to a user style sheet associated with your browser. These definitions will override invalid scroll bar styling on any page you visit.Note: This answer contains information from various sources. If a source was used, then it is also linked in this answer.Custom scroll bars aren\'t possible with CSS, you\'ll need some JavaScript magic.  Some browsers support non-spec CSS rules, such as ::-webkit-scrollbar in Webkit but is not ideal since it\'ll only work in Webkit. IE had something like that too, but I don\'t think they support it anymore.
