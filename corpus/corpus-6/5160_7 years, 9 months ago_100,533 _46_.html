I have a bunch of unannotated tags in the repository and I want to work out which commit they point to. Is there a command that that will just list the tags and their commit SHAs? Checking out the tag and looking at the HEAD seems a bit too labourious to me.I realised after I went through the responses that what I actually wanted was to simply look at the history leading up to the tag, for which git log <tagname> is sufficient. The answer that is marked as answer is useful for getting a list of tags and their commits, which is what I asked. With a bit of shell hackery i\'m sure it\'s possible to transform those into SHA+Commit message.One way to do this would be with git rev-list. The following will output the commit to which a tag points:You could add it as an alias in ~/.gitconfig if you use it a lot:And then call it with:For example, git show-ref --abbrev=7 --tags will show you something like the following:Why make things so complicated?Just use git show <tag>UPDATE: While git show <tag> shows commit hash on the first line, it also dumps diff in command line in some situation (e.g. non-merge commits). To ignore those unwanted diff in the result, use git log -1 <tag> instead. (Thanks to @DolphinDream and @demisx !)Use(which would return SHA-1 of a commit even for annotated tag).git show-ref <tag> would also work if <tag> is not annotated.  And there is always git for-each-ref (see documentation for details).On my repository, git show-ref TAG shows the tag\'s hash, not the hash of the commit it points to.git show-ref --dereference TAG shows, additionally, the commit being pointed at.From Igor Zevaka:Since there are about 4 almost equally acceptable yet different answers I will summarise all the different ways to skin a tag.git rev-list -1 $TAG (answer). git rev-list outputs the commits that lead up to the $TAG similar to git log but only showing the SHA1 of the commit. The -1 limits the output to the commit it points at.git show-ref --tags (answer) will show all tags (local and fetched from remote) and their SHA1s.git show-ref $TAG (answer) will show the tag and its path along with the SHA1.git rev-parse $TAG (answer) will show the SHA1 of an unannotated tag.git rev-parse --verify $TAG^{commit} (answer) will show a SHA1 of both annotated and unannotated tags. On Windows use git rev-parse --verify %TAG%^^^^{commit} (four hats).cat .git/refs/tags/* or cat .git/packed-refs (answer) depending on whether or not the tag is local or fetched from remote.How about this:OR In order to get the sha/hash of the commit that a tag refers to (not the sha of the tag):git rev-list -1 <tag>I\'d also like to know the "right" way, but in the meantime, you can do this:You could as well get more easy-to-interpret picture of where tags point to usingand then scroll to the tag you\'re looking for via /.More compact view (--pretty=oneline) plus all heads (-a) could also help:Looks a bit terrifying, but could also be aliased in ~/.gitconfig if necessary.This will get you the current SHA1 hash Abbreviated Commit HashCommit Hash Even though this is pretty old, I thought I would point out a cool feature I just found for listing tags with commits:It will show the branches which end/start at a commit, and the tags for commits.i\'d also like to know the right way, but you can always peek either into:or:If you would like to see the details of the tag SOMETAG (tagger, date, etc), the hash of the commit it points to and a bit of info about the commit but without the full diff, tryExample output:This doesn\'t show the filenames, but at least you get a feel of the repository.Each file in that directory contains a commit SHA pointing to a commit.So I have a load of release folders, where those folders may be checked out from one of a few different repos, and may be dev, qa or master branches or may be production releases, checked out from a tag, and the tag may be annotated or not.  I have a script that will look at the target folder and get be back an answer in the form -.  The problem is different versions of git return different status\' for a tag checkout.  So I found git show-ref --tags worked initially, except for the annotated tags.  However adding -d added a separate entry to the list of tags, one for the tag, the other for the annotation (the annotation commit was identified as ^{} which I stripped out with sed).  So this is the core of my script, for anyone that wants it:-
