I want to find out the following:\ngiven a date (datetime object), what is the corresponding day of the week.For instance Sunday is the first day, Monday: second day.. and so onAnd then if the input is something like Today\'s date.\nThe output is maybe 6 (since its Friday)Use weekday() (docs):From the documentation:Return the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.If you\'d like to have the date in English:Use date.weekday() or date.isoweekday().A solution whithout imports for dates after 1700/1/1 I solved this for a codechef question.This is a solution if the date is a datetime object.datetime library sometimes gives errors with strptime() so I switched to dateutil library. Here\'s an example of how you can use it :The output that you get from this is \'Mon\'. If you want the output as \'Monday\', use the following :This worked for me pretty quickly. I was having problems while using the datetime library because I wanted to store the weekday name instead of weekday number and the format from using the datetime library was causing problems. If you\'re not having problems with this, great! If you are, you cand efinitely go for this as it has a simpler syntax as well. Hope this helps.Assuming you are given the day, month, and year, you could do:If you have reason to avoid the use of the datetime module, then this function will work.Note: The change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar is assumed to have occurred in 1582. If this is not true for your calendar of interest then change the line if year > 1582: accordingly.To get Sunday as 1 through Saturday as 7, this is the simplest solution to your question:All of them:Output:here is how to convert a listof dates to date:)
