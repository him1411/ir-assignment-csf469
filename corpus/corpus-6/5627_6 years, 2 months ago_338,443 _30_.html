You also need version 4.0 of Oracle SQL Developer, in which you access Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler through the Data Modeler submenu [...] Alternatively, you can use the standalone Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler. The modeling functionality is identical in the two implementations, and both are available as free downloads from Oracle Technology Network.In Oracle SQL Developer, select View -> Data Modeler \xe2\x80\x93> Browser.

As the Data Modeler tutorial states: Figure 4: Relational model and diagram for HRThe diagram you\xe2\x80\x99ve generated is not an ERD. Logical models are higher abstractions. An ERD represents entities and their attributes and relations, whereas a relational or physical model represents tables, columns, and foreign keys."
