I am downloading a JSON file from an online source and and when it runs through the loop I am getting this error:Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in C:\\wamp\\www\\temp\\fetch.php on line 24Your loop might be endless. If it is not, you could extend the maximum execution time like this:I had the same problem and solved it by changing the value for the param max_execution_time in php.ini, like this:I hope this could help you.All the answers above are correct, but I use a simple way to avoid it in some cases.Just put this command in the begining of your script:Your script is timing out. Take a look at the set_time_limit() function to up the execution time. Or profile the script to make it run faster :)I ran into this problem while upgrading to WordPress 4.0. By default WordPress limits the maximum execution time to 30 seconds. Add the following code to your .htaccess file on your root directory of your WordPress Installation to over-ride the default. Edit php.iniFind this line:Change its value to 300:300 means 5 minutes of execution time for the http request.if all the above didn\'t work for you then add an .htaccess file to the directory where your script is located and put this insidethis was the way I solved my problem , neither ini_set(\'max_execution_time\', 86400); nor set_time_limit(86400) solved my problem , but the .htaccess method did. We can solve this problem in 3 different ways.1) Using php.ini file2) Using .htaccess file3) Using Wp-config.php file ( for Wordpress )For more details -> steptoinstallFollow the path /etc/php5(your php version)/apache2/php.ini. Open it and set the value of max_execution_time to a desired one.Maybe check for any thing that you have changed under the php.ini file.\nFor example I changed the ";intl.default_locale =" to ";intl.default_locale = en_utf8" in order to enable the "Internationalization extension (Intl)" without adding the "extension=php_intl.dll" then this same error occurred. So I suggest to check for similar mistakes.you cando it easily with whm . jusst got to whm----->service configuration---------->php configuration editor-------max_execution_time----->30(it is default change it to whatever value u want)You can remove the restriction by seting it to zero by adding this line at the top of your script:Increase your script execution time by adding the following line at top of the PHP script.Reference has taken from Increase the PHP Script Execution TimeTo extend your max_execution_time you can use either ini_set or set_time_limit.so if you want to set exact maximum amount of time script can run, your command must be very first.Differences between those two functions areI have same problem in WordPress site, \nI added in .htaccess file then working fine for me.
