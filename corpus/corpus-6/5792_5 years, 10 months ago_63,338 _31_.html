Can some one please describe the usage of the following characters which is used in ERB file:what\'s the usage of each one ? Executes the ruby code within the brackets.Prints something into erb file.Avoids line break after expression.Comments out code within brackets; not sent to client (as opposed to HTML comments).Visit Ruby Doc for more infos about ERB.<% %> and <%- and -%> are for any Ruby code, but doesn\'t output the results (e.g. if statements). the two are the same.<%= %> is for outputting the results of Ruby code<%# %> is an ERB commentHere\'s a good guide:\nhttp://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Base.htmlRails does not use the stdlib\'s ERB by default, it uses erubis. Sources: this dev\'s comment, ActionView\'s gemspec, accepted merge request I did while writing this.There are behavior differences between them, in particular on how the hyphen operators %- and -% work.Documentation is scarce, Where is Ruby's ERB format "officially" defined? so what follows are empirical conclusions.All tests suppose:When you can use -Examples:What -% does:ERB: remove the next character if it is a newline.erubis:in <% %> (without =), - is useless because <% %> and <% -%> are the same. <% %> removes the current line if it only contains whitespaces, and does nothing otherwise.in <%= -%> (with =):Examples:What %- does:ERB: remove whitespaces before tag and after previous newlines, but only if there are only whitespaces before.erubis: useless because <%- %> is the same as <% %> (without =), and this cannot be used with = which is the only case where -% can be useful. So never use this.Examples:What %- and -% do togetherThe exact combination of both effects separately. I\'ve added the <%% literal tag delimiter as an answer to this because of its obscurity.  This will tell erb not to interpret the <% part of the tag which is necessary for js apps like displaying chart.js tooltips etc.Everything about ERB can be found here:\nhttps://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_template_erb.html#tags
