What\'s a good technique for validating an e-mail address (e.g. from a user input field) in Android? org.apache.commons.validator.routines.EmailValidator doesn\'t seem to be available. Are there any other libraries doing this which are included in Android already or would I have to use RegExp?Don\'t use a reg-ex.  Apparently the following is a reg-ex that correctly validates most e-mails addresses that conform to RFC 2822, (and will still fail on things like "user@gmail.com.nospam", as will org.apache.commons.validator.routines.EmailValidator)Possibly the easiest way to validate an e-mail to just send a confirmation e-mail to the address provided and it it bounces then it\'s not valid.If you want to perform some basic checks you could just check that it\'s in the form *@*If you have some business logic specific validation then you could perform that using a regex, e.g. must be a gmail.com account or something.Another option is the built in Patterns starting with API Level 8:Patterns viewable sourceOROne line solution from @AdamvandenHoven:Next pattern is used in K-9 mail:You can use functionSince API 8 (android 2.2) there is a pattern: android.util.Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Patterns.htmlSo you can use it to validate yourEmailString:returns true if the email is validUPD:\nThis pattern source code is:refer to: http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/2.2_r1.1/android/util/Patterns.javaSo you can build it yourself for compatibility with API < 8.We have simple Email pattern matcher nowThis is Android Studio suggestions:use android:inputType="textEmailAddress" as below:and:You can use regular expression to do so. Something like the following.Note: Check the regular expression given above, don\'t use it as it is.Use simple one line code for email Validationuse like...Call This Method where you want to validate email ID. For an Email validation android provide some InBuilt Pattern.But it only support API level 8 and above.Here is code for use that pattern to check email validation.Make sure that after execute this method you should check that if this method return true then you allow to save email and if this method return false then display message that email is "Invalid".Hope you get your answer,\nThanks you.Validate your email address format. Ex-virag@gmail.comCan I STRONGLY recommend you don\'t try to \'validate\' email addresses, you\'ll just get yourself into a lot of work for no good reason.Just make sure what is entered won\'t break your own code - e.g. no spaces or illegal characters which might cause an Exception.Anything else will just cause you a lot of work for minimal return...Try this code.. Its really works..Note that most of the regular expressions are not valid for international domain names (IDN) and new top level domains like .mobi or .info (if you check for country codes or .org, .com, .gov and so on).A valid check should separate the local part (before the at-sign) and the domain part. You should also consider the max length of the local part and domain (in sum 255 chars including the at-sign).The best approach is to transform the address in an IDN compatible format (if required), validate the local part (RFC), check the length of the address and the check the availability of the domain (DNS MX lookup) or simply send an email.Try this simple method which can not accept the email address beginning with digits:The Linkify class has some pretty useful helper methods that might be relevant, including regular expressions designed to pick up phone numbers and email addresses and such:http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/util/Linkify.htmlI have used follwing code.This works grate.I hope this will help you.and use follwing method.This returns true if email is valid.email is your email-is.For regex lovers, the very best (e.g. consistant with RFC 822) email\'s pattern I ever found since now is the following (before PHP supplied filters). I guess it\'s easy to translate this into Java - for those playing with API < 8  :You can do any type of validation in android very easily by the oval.jar file. OVal is a pragmatic and extensible general purpose validation framework for any kind of Java objects.follow this link: http://oval.sourceforge.net/userguide.htmlYou can downlaod this from here: http://oval.sourceforge.net/userguide.html#downloadYou can use validation by setting tags in variablesYou could also useIf the email is not valid it will throw an AddressException.Unfortunately Android doesn\'t support jndi-dns, but just to give you an idea of a more powerful email validation, you could use it to validate the email domain. Maybe an Android guru could help and show if there are similar alternatives... An example implementation with "regular" java is available here.EDITI just realized that javax.mail isn\'t support neither... But this post shows a workaround.I know that It\'s very too late, still I will give my answer.I used this line of code to check the inputted Email format:The problem is, it will only check for the FORMAT not the SPELLING.When I entered @gmal.com missing i ,and @yaho.com missing another o .\nIt return true. Since it satisfies the condition for Email Format.What I did is, I used the code above. Since it will give / return true if\nthe if the user inputted @gmail.com ONLY, no text at the start.FORMAT CHECKERIf I enter this email it will give me: true but the spelling is wrong. In\nmy textInputLayout error EMAIL ADDRESS @yahoo.com , @gmail.com, @outlook.com  CHECKERRETURN: falseRETURN:trueXML:Note: I tried to get the value from EditText and used split on it and even StringTokenizer. Both return false to me.  If you are using API 8 or above, you can use the readily available Patterns class to validate email. Sample code:By chance if you are even supporting API level less than 8, then you can simply copy the Patterns.java file into your project and reference it. You can get the source code for Patterns.java from this linkSimplest way of Email Validation.
