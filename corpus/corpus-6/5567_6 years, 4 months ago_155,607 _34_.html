Can you explain what is wrong with this workflow?Doesn\'t git push always push to the repository I cloned from?Yes, the problem is that there are no commits in "bare".  This is a problem with the first commit only, if you create the repos in the order (bare,alice).  Try doing:This would only be required the first time.  Afterwards it should work normally.As Chris Johnsen pointed out, you would not have this problem if your push.default was customized.  I like upstream/tracking.If you:it will push to the bare repo.It sounds like your alice repo isn\'t tracking correctly.This will show the default remote and branch.If youYou should start tracking that remote and branch. I\'m not sure if that option has always been in git.This related question\'s answer provided the solution for me... it was just a dumb mistake: Remember to commit first!https://stackoverflow.com/a/7572252If you have not yet committed to your local repo, there is nothing to push, but the Git error message you get back doesn\'t help you too much. is the canonical way to push everything to a new bare repository.Another way to do the same thing is to create your new, non-bare repository and then make a bare clone withthen usein the original (non-bare) repository.Try this in your alice repository (before pushing):Or, configure it as the default for your user with git config --global \xe2\x80\xa6.git push does default to the origin repository (which is normally the repository from which you cloned the current repository), but it does not default to pushing the current branch\xe2\x80\x94it defaults to pushing only branches that exist in both the source repository and the destination repository.The push.default configuration variable (see git-config(1)) controls what git push will push when it is not given any \xe2\x80\x9crefspec\xe2\x80\x9d arguments (i.e. something after a repository name). The default value gives the behavior described above.Here are possible values for push.default:nothing\nThis forces you to supply a \xe2\x80\x9crefspec\xe2\x80\x9d.matching (the default)\nThis pushes all branches that exist in both the source repository and the destination repository.\nThis is completely independent of the branch that is currently checked out.upstream or tracking\n(Both values mean the same thing. The later was deprecated to avoid confusion with \xe2\x80\x9cremote-tracking\xe2\x80\x9d branches. The former was introduced in 1.7.4.2, so you will have to use the latter if you are using Git 1.7.3.1.)\nThese push the current branch to the branch specified by its \xe2\x80\x9cupstream\xe2\x80\x9d configuration.  current\nThis pushes the current branch to the branch of the same name at the destination repository.  These last two end up being the same for common cases (e.g. working on local master which uses origin/master as its upstream), but they are different when the local branch has a different name from its \xe2\x80\x9cupstream\xe2\x80\x9d branch:With push.default equal to upstream (or tracking), the push would go to origin\xe2\x80\x99s master branch. When it is equal to current, the push would go to origin\xe2\x80\x99s quickfix branch.The matching setting will update bare\xe2\x80\x99s master in your scenario once it has been established. To establish it, you could use git push origin master once.However, the upstream setting (or maybe current) seems like it might be a better match for what you expect to happen, so you might want to try it:(Again, if you are still using a Git before 1.7.4.2, you will need to use tracking instead of upstream).I use SourceTree git client, and I see that their initial commit/push command is:
