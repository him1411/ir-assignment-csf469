When you have to loop through a collection and make a string of each data separated by a delimiter, you always end up with an extra delimiter at the end, e.g.Gives something like : serverId_1, serverId_2, serverId_3,I would like to delete the last character in the StringBuilder (without converting it because I still need it after this loop).Others have pointed out the deleteCharAt method, but here\'s another alternative approach:Alternatively, use the Joiner class from Guava :)As of Java 8, StringJoiner is part of the standard JRE.Another simple solution is:A more complicated solution:The above solution assumes that sb.length() > 0 ... i.e. there is a "last character" to remove.  If you can\'t make that assumption, and/or you can\'t deal with the exception that would ensue if the assumption is incorrect, then check the StringBuilder\'s length first; e.g.or As of Java 8, there\'s a new StringJoiner class built in.In this case,is preferable as it just assign the last value to \'\\0\' whereas deleting last character does System.arraycopyJust get the position of the last character occurrence.Since lastIndexOf will perform a reverse search, and you know that it will find at the first try, performance won\'t be an issue here.Another alternativeAlternatively,With Java-8 you can use static method of String class,String#join(CharSequence delimiter,Iterable<? extends CharSequence> elements).OUTPUTYet another alternative:To avoid reinit(affect performance) of  prefix use TextUtils.isEmpty:I am doing something like this:You may try to use \'Joiner\' class instead of removing the last character from your generated text;Here is another solution:
