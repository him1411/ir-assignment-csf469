Is there a way to find out what version of jQuery is being used by inspecting the jQuery object? jQuery is dynamically getting added to my page and I cannot see any reference to it in my markup. If I inspect it in my browser\'s console, its there.You can use either $().jquery; or $.fn.jquery which will return a string containing the version number, e.g. 1.6.2.FYI, for the cases where your page is loading with other javascript libraries like mootools that are conflicting with the $ symbol, you can use jQuery instead.For instance, jQuery.fn.jquery or jQuery().jquery would work just fine:$().jquery will give you its version as a string.Invoke console.log($()) and take note about jquery  object fields : For older versions of jQueryFor newer versions of jQueryalert( \'You are running jQuery version: \' + $.fn.jquery );$.jquery should tell you version numberEDIT: reference: http://api.jquery.com/jquery-2/You can get the version of the jquery by simply printing object.jquery, the object can be any object created by you using $. For Eg: if you have created a  element as following\nvar divObj = $("div");then by printing Obj.jquery will show you the version like 1.7.1 Basically divObj inherits all the property of $() or jQuery() i.e if you try to print jQuery.fn.jquery will also print the same version like 1.7.1
