This seems to occur a lot, and was wondering if this was a requirement in the Python language, or merely a matter of convention?Also, could someone name and explain which functions tend to have the underscores, and why (__init__, for instance)?From the Python PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/):the following special forms using leading or trailing underscores are\n  recognized (these can generally be combined with any case convention):_single_leading_underscore: weak "internal use" indicator.  E.g. "from M import *" does not import objects whose name starts with an\n  underscore.single_trailing_underscore_: used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword, e.g.Tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_=\'ClassName\')__double_leading_underscore: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, __boo becomes _FooBar__boo; see below).  __double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__: "magic" objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces.  E.g. __init__,\n  __import__ or __file__.  Never invent such names; only use them as documented.Note that names with double leading and trailing underscores are essentially reserved for Python itself: "Never invent such names; only use them as documented".The other respondents are correct in describing the double leading and trailing underscores as a naming convention for "special" or "magic" methods.While you can call these methods directly ([10, 20].__len__() for example), the presence of the underscores is a hint that these methods are intended to be invoked indirectly (len([10, 20]) for example).  Most python operators have an associated "magic" method (for example, a[x] is the usual way of invoking a.__getitem__(x)).Names surrounded by double underscores are "special" to Python. They\'re listed in the Python Language Reference, section 3, "Data model".Actually I use _ method names when I need to differ between parent and child class names. I\'ve read some codes that used this way of creating parent-child classes. As an example I can provide this code: ...and the child that have a _worker method ...
