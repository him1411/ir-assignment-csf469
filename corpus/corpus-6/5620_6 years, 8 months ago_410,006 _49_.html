I am introducing myself to Git by following this tutorial:Everything works fine up until the part where the repo is added to my local machine:(After replacing USERNAME, NFSNSERVER, and REPOAME with the correct names) I receive the error:Can you help me get past this step?Did you init a local Git repository, into which this remote is supposed to be added?Does your local directory have a .git folder?Try git init.You\'ll get this error if you try to use a Git command when your current working directory is not within a Git repository. That is because, by default, Git will look for a .git repository directory (inside of the project root?), as pointed out by my answer to "Git won\'t show log unless I am in the project directory":According to the official Linux Kernel Git documentation,\n  GIT_DIR is [an environment variable] set to look for a .git directory (in the current\n  working directory?) by default:If the GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of the default .git for the base of the\n    repository.You\'ll either need to cd into the repository/working copy, or you didn\'t initialize or clone a repository in the first place, in which case you need to initialize a repo in the directory where you want to place the repo:or clone a repositoryNOTE: this does not answer to the common problem, which was OP\xe2\x80\x99s problem, but to different problem where this error message may come up. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like doing new question just to write this answer down, tell me if I should do that instead :PI got to situation, most likely due to some corruption of certain crash I had, that I got this error even when .git did exist.Since I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything that really needed preserving, I just went with dummy way, and did...Still not working though, as for example git log returns fatal: bad default revision \'HEAD\'. Remotes were there though, so I did git fetch --all and then just git reset --hard origin/master to get myself to the state the repo was previously.Note that if there is some uncommitted changes, you can see them with git status, git diff and so on. Then just git diff yourfile > patch before running the reset.At least for me reflog (git reflog) disappeared completely. Hence, if you do the reset, and there was some changes you wanted to prevent, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure you can get them back after reset anymore. So, make sure that you have all changes you can\xe2\x80\x99t lose backed up, ultimately by just copying the clone before trying this.In command line/CLI, you will get this error if your current directory is NOT the repository. So, you have to first CD into the repo.This issue occurred to me after I moved the location of a git project on the filesystem. When I ran some git commands the error occurred, e.g.:I found in /home/rospasta/path_old/gitprojecta/.travis/.git the absolute path of the old location of the project was written. Manually updating this path of the new location resolved the problem for me.So my issue may or may not be a git problem, but HTH.Probably too late but Another solution that might help future visitors.\nFirst delete the old .git directory -Then initialize the git repo againIt seems like you are not going to your specific folder. For example, if I am working on a project  named bugsBunny and it is saved in the folder d:/work:code , so first you have to go to that folder using cd d:/work/code/bugsBunny , then after that you can continue using your git commands.In my case I used Tortoise SVN and made the mistake to also use the Visual Studio GIT functions at the same time. That made Visual Studio lock the HEAD file inside the .git folder so neither VS or Tortoise could access the repo and i got the "fatal: Not a git repo..." error from both applications.Solution:in my case, i had the same problem while i try any git -- commands (eg git status) using windows cmd. so what i do is after installing git for window https://windows.github.com/ in the environmental variables, add the class path of the git on the "PATH" varaiable. usually the git will installed on C:/user/"username"/appdata/local/git/bin add this on the PATH in the environmental variableand one more thing on the cmd go to your git repository or cd to where your clone are on your window usually they will be stored on the documents under github cd Document/Github/yourproject after that you can have any git commandsthank youBelow error seems like Gits didn\'t find .git file in current directory so throwing error message. Therefore change to directory to repository directory where you have checkout the code from git and then run this command.Go to your source folder where local repo is stored , example mine is found in c:/GitSource , right click while in the folder , click git bash here , then git status.... Even i had the same problem. i wrote a shell script which will backup all my codes to my git repo on working days of a week at 17:55 by using crontab. by seeing the logs of cron i found the above mentioned problem.the above problem comes only when you are trying to execute git commands from a non-gir dir(ie from other dir which is not the working copy). to fix this add -C <git dir> in the git command you are executing such that\ngit status will be git -C /dir/to/git status and git add -A will be git -C /dir/to/git -A.My problem was that for some hiccups with my OS any command on my local repository ended with "fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git", with fsck command included.The problem was empty HEAD file.I was able to find actual branch name I\'ve worked on in .git/refs/heads and then I did this:It worked.For me, this was related to malformed ownership in my .git/ path.  root owned .git/HEAD and .git/index, preventing the jenkins user from running the job.  Just type the following in your cmd or git shell or any other terminal:GIT_DIR should be unset: unset GIT_DIRIn my case I found that git in windows became case sensitive for the drive letter from some point.After upgrading git binary in windows cli commands that used to work stopped.\nfor example the path in the script was D:\\bla\\file.txt while git command accepted only d:\\bla\\file.txtgit was working fine for be and all of sudden it started showing this fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git message. For me not sure what was corrupted in .git folder, I did git clone ** newfolder and copied the entire .git folder to my corrupted/old folder where I was making changes before git started showing error message.. Everything got back to normal and git also recognized my changed/un-staged files. For that you need to enter one command that is missing from bitbucket commandsPlease try git init.
