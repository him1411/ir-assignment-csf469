Can anyone tell me if the following CSS is valid?You probably want transparent as none is not a valid background-color value.The CSS 2.1 spec states the following for the background-color property:Value:   <color> | transparent | inherit<color> can be either a keyword or a numerical representation of a colour. Valid color keywords are:aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive,\n  orange, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellowtransparent and inherit are valid keywords in their own right, but none is not.No, use transparent instead none . See working example here  in this example if you will change transparent to none it will not workuse like .class { background-color:transparent; }The answer is no.background-color: transparent accomplishes the same thing what you wanted to do with background-color: none.This is not a valid property. W3C validator will display following error:Value Error : background-color none is not a background-color value : nonetransparent may have been selected as better term instead of 0 or none values during the development of specification of CSS.CSS Level 3 specifies the unset property value. From MDN:The unset CSS keyword is the combination of the initial and inherit\n  keywords. Like these two other CSS-wide keywords, it can be applied to\n  any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand all. This keyword resets\n  the property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent or\n  to its initial value if not. In other words, it behaves like the\n  inherit keyword in the first case and like the initial keyword in the\n  second case.Unfortunately this value is currently not supported in all browsers, including IE, Safari and Opera. I suggest using transparent for the time being.
