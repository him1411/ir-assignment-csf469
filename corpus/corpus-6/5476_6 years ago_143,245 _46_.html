I tried to serialize POCO class that was automatically generated from Entity Data Model .edmx and when I usedI got the following error:Error Self referencing loop detected for type System.data.entity occurs .How do I solve this problem?Use JsonSerializerSettingsExample:Should you have to serialize an object that is nested indefinitely you can use PreserveObjectReferences to avoid a StackOverflowException.Example:Pick what makes sense for the object you are serializing. Reference http://james.newtonking.com/json/help/That was the best solution \nhttp://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Loop-Reference-handling-in-caaffaf7Fix 1: Ignoring circular reference globally (I have chosen/tried this one)json.net serializer supports to ignore circular reference on global setting. A quick fix is to put following code in WebApiConfig.cs file:The simple fix will make serializer to ignore the reference which will cause a loop. However, it has limitations:The data loses the looping reference information\nThe fix only applies to JSON.net\nThe level of references can\'t be controlled if there is a deep reference chainFix 2: Preserving circular reference globallyThis second fix is similar to the first. Just change the code to:The data shape will be changed after applying this setting.The $id and $ref keeps the all the references and makes the object graph level flat, but the client code needs to know the shape change to consume the data and it only applies to JSON.NET serializer as well.Fix 3: Ignore and preserve reference attributesThis fix is decorate attributes on model class to control the serialization behavior on model or property level. To ignore the property:JsonIgnore is for JSON.NET and IgnoreDataMember is for XmlDCSerializer. \nTo preserve reference:JsonObject(IsReference = true)]is for JSON.NET and [DataContract(IsReference = true)] is for XmlDCSerializer. Note that: after applying DataContract on class, you need to add DataMember to properties that you want to serialize.The attributes can be applied on both json and xml serializer and gives more controls on model class.The fix is to ignore loop references and not to serialize them. This behaviour is specified in JsonSerializerSettings.Single JsonConvert with an overload:Global Setting with code in Application_Start() in Global.asax.cs:Reference: https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/issues/78Simplest way to do this is to add [JsonIgnore] to the virtual property in the class, for example:Although these days, I create a model with only the properties I want passed through so it\'s lighter, doesn\'t include unwanted collections, and I don\'t lose my changes when I rebuild the generated files...In .NET Core 1.0, you can set this as a global setting in your Startup.cs file:We can add these two lines into DbContext class constructor to disable Self referencing loop, likeYou can apply an attribute to the property too. \nThe [JsonProperty( ReferenceLoopHandling = ... )] attribute is well suited to this.For example:Hope that helps,\nJaansTo ignore loop references and not to serialize them globally in MVC 6 use the following in startup.cs:Use this in WebApiConfig.cs class : For me I had to go a different route.  Instead of trying to fix the JSON.Net serializer I had to go after the Lazy Loading on my datacontext.  I just added this to my base repository:The "context" object is a constructor parameter I use in my base repository because I use dependency injection.  You could change the ProxyCreationEnabled property anywhere you instantiate your datacontext instead.http://techie-tid-bits.blogspot.com/2015/09/jsonnet-serializer-and-error-self.htmlSimply place Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled = false; inside the context file; this will solve the problem.I liked the solution that does it from Application_Start() as in the answer hereApparently I could not access the json objects in JavaScript using the configuration within my function  as in DalSoft\'s answer as the object returned had "\\n \\r" all over the (key, val) of the object.Anyway whatever works is great (because different approaches work in different scenario based on the comments and questions asked) though a standard way of doing it would be preferable with some good documentation supporting the approach.To serialize usin NEWTONSOFTJSON when you have loop issue, in my case I did not need modify global.asax or either apiconfig. I just use JsonSerializesSettings ignoring Looping handling.
