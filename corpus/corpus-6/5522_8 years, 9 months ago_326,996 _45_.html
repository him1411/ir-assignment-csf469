How do I calculate distance between two GPS coordinates (using latitude and longitude)?Calculate the distance between two coordinates by latitude and longitude, including a Javascript implementation.West and South locations are negative.\n  Remember minutes and seconds are out of 60 so S31 30\' is -31.50 degrees.Don\'t forget to convert degrees to radians.  Many languages have this function.  Or its a simple calculation: radians = degrees * PI / 180.Here are some examples of usage:Look for haversine with Google; here is my solution:C# Version of HaversineHere\'s a .NET Fiddle of this, so you can test it out with your own Lat/Longs.Java Version of Haversine Algorithm based on Roman Makarov`s reply to this threadThis is very easy to do with geography type in SQL Server 2008.4326 is SRID for WGS84 elipsoidal Earth modelIt depends on how accurate you need it to be, if you need pinpoint accuracy, is best to look at an algorithm with uses an ellipsoid, rather than a sphere, such as Vincenty\'s algorithm, which is accurate to the mm. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty%27s_algorithmHere it is in C# (lat and long in radians):If your lat and long are in degrees then divide by 180/PI to convert to radians.Here\'s a Haversine function in Python that I use:PHP version:(Remove all deg2rad() if your coordinates are already in radians.)A T-SQL function, that I use to select records by distance for a centerIf you need something more accurate then have a look at this.Vincenty\'s formulae are two related iterative methods used in geodesy\n  to calculate the distance between two points on the surface of a\n  spheroid, developed by Thaddeus Vincenty (1975a) They are based on the\n  assumption that the figure of the Earth is an oblate spheroid, and\n  hence are more accurate than methods such as great-circle distance\n  which assume a spherical Earth.The first (direct) method computes the location of a point which is a\n  given distance and azimuth (direction) from another point. The second\n  (inverse) method computes the geographical distance and azimuth\n  between two given points. They have been widely used in geodesy\n  because they are accurate to within 0.5 mm (0.020\xe2\x80\xb3) on the Earth\n  ellipsoid.I. Regarding "Breadcrumbs" methodBelow see the function in C which takes #1 and #2 into account:II. There is an easier way which gives pretty good results.By Average Speed.Trip_distance = Trip_average_speed * Trip_timeSince GPS Speed is detected by Doppler effect and is not directly related to [Lon,Lat] it can be  at least considered as secondary (backup or correction) if not as main distance calculation method.I needed to calculate a lot of distances between the points for my project, so I went ahead and tried to optimize the code, I have found here. On average in different browsers my new implementation runs 2 times faster than the most upvoted answer.You can play with my jsPerf and see the results here.Recently I needed to do the same in python, so here is a python implementation:And for the sake of completeness: Haversine on wiki.This Lua code is adapted from stuff found on Wikipedia and in Robert Lipe\'s GPSbabel tool:I recently had to do the same thing.  I found this website to be very helpful explaining spherical trig with examples that were easy to follow along with.you can find a implementation of this (with some good explanation) in F# on fssniphere are the important parts:This is version from "Henry Vilinskiy" adapted for MySQL and Kilometers:I needed to implement this in PowerShell, hope it can help someone else.\nSome notes about this methodI\'m using Haversine, as other posts have pointed out Vincenty\'s formulae is much more accurateI guess you want it along the curvature of the earth. Your two points and the center of the earth are on a plane. The center of the earth is the center of a circle on that plane and the two points are (roughly) on the perimeter of that circle. From that you can calculate the distance by finding out what the angle from one point to the other is.If the points are not the same heights, or if you need to take into account that the earth is not a perfect sphere it gets a little more difficult.// Maybe a typo error ?\nWe have an unused variable dlon in GetDirection,\nI assume should be Scala versionIf you\'re using .NET don\'t reivent the wheel.
