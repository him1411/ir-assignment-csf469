I\'m new to jQuery and was wondering how to use it to validate email addresses.You can use regular old javascript for that:jQuery Function to Validate EmailI really don\xe2\x80\x99t like to use plugins, especially when my form only has one field that needs to be validated. I use this function and call it whenever I need to validate an email form field.and now to use this Cheers!I would use the jQuery validation plugin for a few reasons.You validated, ok great, now what?  You need to display the error, handle erasing it when it is valid, displaying how many errors total perhaps?  There are lots of things it can handle for you, no need to re-invent the wheel.Also, another huge benefit is it\'s hosted on a CDN, the current version at the time of this answer can be found here: http://www.asp.net/ajaxLibrary/CDNjQueryValidate16.ashx  This means faster load times for the client.Look at http: //bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/. It is nice jQuery plugin, which allow to build powerfull validation system for forms.\nThere are some usefull samples here. So, email field validation in form will look so: See Email method documentation for details and samples.I would recommend Verimail.js, it also has a JQuery plugin.Why? Verimail supports the following:So besides validation, Verimail.js also gives you suggestions. So if you type an email with the wrong TLD or domain that is very similar to a common email domain (hotmail.com, gmail.com, etc), it can detect this and suggest a correction.Examples:And so on..To use it with jQuery, just include verimail.jquery.js on your site and run the function below:The message element is an element in which a message will be shown. This can be everything from "Your email is invalid" to "Did you mean ...?". If you have a form and want to restrict it so that it cannot be submitted unless the email is valid, then you can check the status using the getVerimailStatus-function as shown below:This function returns an integer status code according to the object Comfirm.AlphaMail.Verimail.Status. But the general rule of thumb is that any codes below 0 is codes indicating errors.\n    : www.htmldrive.net \n    \nSource:htmldrive.comthis was provided by user Luca Filosofi in this answer this answerThis performs a more thorough validation, for example it checks against successive dots in the username such as john..doe@example.com See validate email address using regular expression in JavaScript.If you have a basic form, just make the input type of email:\n    <input type="email" required>This will work for browsers that use HTML5 attributes and then you do not even need JS. Just using email validation even with some of the scripts above will not do much since:some@email.com\nso@em.co\nmy@fakemail.netetc... Will all validate as "real" emails. So you would be better off ensuring that the user has to enter their email address twice to make sure that they put the same one in. But to guarantee that the email address is real would be very difficult but very interesting to see if there was a way. But if you are just making sure that it is an email, stick to the HTML5 input.FIDDLE EXAMPLEThis works in FireFox and Chrome. It may not work in Internet Explorer... But internet explorer sucks. So then there\'s that...Use Like This :Landed here.....ended up here:\nhttps://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address...which provided the following regex:...which I found thanks to a note on the jQuery Validation plugin readme: \nhttps://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/master/README.md#reporting-an-issueSo, the updated version of @Fabian\'s answer would be:Hope that helpsFor thoose who want to use a better maintainable solution than disruptive lightyear-long RegEx matches, I wrote up a few lines of code. Thoose who want to save bytes, stick to the RegEx variant :)This restricts:Anyways, it\'s still possible to leak through, so be sure you combine this with a server-side validation + email-link verification.Here\'s the JSFiddleRefernce : JQUERY UI WEBSITEuse this you should see this:jquery.validate.js,add it to your projectusing it like this:Another simple and complete option:Bug is in Jquery Validation Validation Plugin Only validates with @ to change this change the code to this A simplified one I\'ve just made, does what I need it to.\nHave limited it to just alphanumeric, period, underscore and @.Made with help from othersThis regexp prevents duplicate domain names like abc@abc.com.com.com.com, it will allow only domain two time like abc@abc.co.in. It also does not allow statring from number like 123abc@abc.com  All The Best !!!!!Use jquery.validate.js,it have Microsoft ajax CDN.Validate email while typing, with button state handling. As mentioned above, this one is good enough if you ask me.But if you don\'t want the domain ending (.com, .nu, .net etc) to contain numbers (which is my prefered choice) the edited version would be : if you are using jquery validationI created a method emailCustomFormat that used  regex for my custm format you can change it to meet your requirments  then you can use it like thisthis regex acceptabc@abc.abc, abc@abc.abcd\nbut not this abc@abc , abc@abc.a, abc@abc.abcdehope this helps youI take this code from jqvalidate version 1.11.0 and implemented in the version 1.16.0 as aditional method. It worksAnd and in the email ruleA very simple solution is to use html5 validation:http://jsfiddle.net/du676/56/The problem I came across while using Fabian\'s answer, is implementing it in an MVC view because of the Razor @ symbol. You have to include an additional @ symbol to escape it, like so: @@I didn\'t see it elsewhere on this page, so I thought it might be helpful.Here\'s a link from Microsoft describing it\'s usage. \nI just tested the code above and got the following js:Which is doing exactly what it\'s supposed to do.
