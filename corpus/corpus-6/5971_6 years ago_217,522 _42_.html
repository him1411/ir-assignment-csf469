I\'m using the Python bindings to run Selenium WebDriver.I know I can grab a webelement like so...And I know I can get the full page source with...But is there anyway to get the "element source"?The selenium webdriver docs for Python are basically non-existent and I don\'t see anything in the code that seems to enable that functionality.Any thoughts on the best way to access the HTML of an element (and its children)?You can read innerHTML attribute to get source of the content of the element or outerHTML for source with the current element.Python:Java:C#:Ruby:JS:Tested and works with the ChromeDriver.There is not really a straight-forward way of getting the html source code of a webelement. You will have to use JS. I am not too sure about python bindings but you can easily do like this in Java. I am sure there must be something similar to JavascriptExecutor class in Python.Sure we can get all HTML source code with this script below in Selenium Python:If you you want to save it to file:I suggest saving to a file because source code is very very long.In Ruby, using selenium-webdriver (2.32.1), there is a page_source method that contains the entire page source.Looks outdated, but let it be here anyway. The correct way to do it in your case:orBoth are working for me (selenium-server-standalone-2.35.0)Using the attribute method is, in fact, easier and more straight forward.  Using Ruby with the Selenium and PageObject gems, to get the class associated with a certain element, the line would be element.attribute(Class). The same concept applies if you wanted to get other attributes tied to the element. For example, if I wanted the String of an element, element.attribute(String). Java with Selenium 2.53.0I hope this could help:\nhttp://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.htmlHere is described Java method:But unfortunately it\'s not available in Python. So you can translate the method names to Python from Java and try another logic using present methods without getting the whole page source...E.g.And in PHPUnit selenium test it\'s like this:If you are interested in a solution for Remote Control in Python, here is how to get innerHTML:InnerHTML will return element inside the selected element and outerHTML will return inside HTML along with the element you have selectedExample :-\nNow suppose your Element is as below innerHTML element Output outerHTML element Output Live Example :-http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/JavascriptDemo/f/find_out_the_difference_between_innerhtml_and_outerhtml_in_javascript_example.htmBelow you will find the syntax which require as per different binding. Change the innerHTML to outerHTML as per required.Python:Java:If you want whole page HTML use below code :-This code really works to get JavaScript from source as well!
