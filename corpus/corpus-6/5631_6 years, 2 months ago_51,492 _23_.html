Both seem to be used in web development circles, see e.g. HTML5 Cross Browser Polyfills, which says:So here we\'re collecting all the shims, fallbacks, and polyfills...Or, there\'s the es5-shim project.In my current project we\'re using a number of these, and I want to stick them all in the same directory. So, what should I call this directory---shims, or polyfills?Call it shims if you want to keep the directory generic. A polyfill is a type of shim that retrofits legacy browsers with modern HTML5/CSS3 features usually using Javascript or Flash. A shim, on the other hand, refers to any piece of code that performs interception of an API call and provides a layer of abstraction. It isn\'t necessarily restricted to a web application or HTML5/CSS3.From what I understand:A polyfill is code that detects if a certain "expected" API is missing and manually implements it. E.g. A shim is code that intercepts existing API calls and implements different behavior. The idea here is to normalize certain APIs across different environments. So, if two browsers implement the same API differently, you could intercept the API calls in one of those browsers and make its behavior align with the other browser. Or, if a browser has a bug in one of its APIs, you could again intercept calls to that API, and then circumvent the bug.Shim If you are familiar with the adapter pattern, then you know what a shim is. Shims intercepts API calls and creates an abstract layer between the caller and the target. Typically shims are used for backward compability. For instance the es5-shim npm package will let you write ECMAScript 5 (ES5) syntax and not care if the browser is running ES5 or not. Take Date.now as an example. This is a new function in ES5 where the syntax in ES3 would be new Date().getTime(). If you use the es5-shim you can write Date.now and if the browser you\xe2\x80\x99re running in supports ES5 it will just run. However, if the browser is running the ES3 engine es5-shim will intercept the call to Date.now and just return new Date().getTime() instead. This interception is called shimming. The relevant source code from es5-shim looks like this:PolyfillPolyfilling is really just a specialized version of shimming. Polyfill is about implementing missing features in an API, whereas a shim wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be as much about implementing missing features as it is about correcting features. I know these seems overly vague, but where shims are used as a more broader term, polyfill is used to describe shims that provide backward compability for older browsers. So while shims are used for covering up old sins, polyfills are used for bringing future enhancements back in time. \nAs an example there is no support for sessionStorage in IE7, but the polyfill in the sessionstorage npm package will add this feature in IE7 (and older) by using techniques like storing data in the name property of the window or by using cookies. Citing Axel Rauschmayer from his book Speaking JavaScript:Polyfilla is a UK product known as Spackling Paste in the US. With that in mind: think of the browsers as a wall with cracks in it. These\n    [polyfills] help smooth out the cracks and give us a nice smooth wall\n    of browsers to work with.Shim. A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment.Polyfill. In October 2010, Remy Sharp blogged about the term \xe2\x80\x9cpolyfill\xe2\x80\x9d [via Rick Waldron]:A polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively. Flattening the API landscape if you will.A fantastic article written about this from a few years back that explains this well:What is a Polyfill?In the article the (2) are simply contrasted as such:Shim: a piece of code that you could add (i.e. JavaScript) that would fix some functionality, but it would most often have it\'s own API.Polyfill: something you could drop in (i.e. JavaScript) and it would silently work to mimic existing browser APIs that are otherwise unsupported.
