I\'m trying to map a list into hex, and then use the list elsewhere. In python 2.6, this was easy:A: Python 2.6:However, on Python 3.1, the above returns a map object.B: Python 3.1:How do I retrieve the mapped list (as in A above) on Python 3.x? Alternatively, is there a better way of doing this? My initial list object has around 45 items and id like to convert them to hex.Do this:In Python 3+, many processes that iterate over iterables return iterators themselves.  In most cases, this ends up saving memory, and should make things go faster.   If all you\'re going to do is iterate over this list eventually, there\'s no need to even convert it to a list, because you can still iterate over the map object like so:Why aren\'t you doing this:It\'s called a list comprehension.  You can find plenty of information on Google, but here\'s the link to the Python (2.6) documentation on list comprehensions.  You might be more interested in the Python 3 documenation, though.New and neat in Python 3.5:Thanks to Additional Unpacking GeneralizationsList-returning map function has the advantage of saving typing, especially during interactive sessions. You can define lmap function (on the analogy of python2\'s imap) that returns list:Then calling lmap instead of map will do the job: \nlmap(str, x) is shorter by 5 characters (30% in this case) than list(map(str, x)) and is certainly shorter than [str(v) for v in x].  You may create similar functions for filter too.There was a comment to the original question:I would suggest a rename to Getting map() to return a list in Python 3.* as it applies to all Python3 versions. Is there a way to do this? \xe2\x80\x93  meawoppl Jan 24 at 17:58It is possible to do that, but it is a very bad idea. Just for fun, here\'s how you may (but should not) do it:I\'m not familiar with Python 3.1, but will this work?
