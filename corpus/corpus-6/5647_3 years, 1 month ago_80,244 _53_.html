After deleting/adding some png files to project, i have got messages when building project."file ProjectPath\\aaa\\xxx.png is missing from working copy."All these files are in the project, and the application is running. However, these messages are annoying. Looked .plist file, but there is no mention of these files.\nWhat should I do to remove these messages?The warning will disappear as soon as you commit your changes (Xcode 8).It seems that this problem may have different causes, but it\'s often in relation with source control software.In my case, I solved it by going to Git, and adding the files again. I mean running the following command:You can also disable source control by unchecking Xcode -> Preferences -> Source Control -> Enable Source Controlif you\'re managing it via command line or any other app. In XCode -> SoureControl:Update + Refresh Status did it for me.In my case, the file was missing from the source control.\nTo fix, I had to discard this file (be careful only discard the missing file not all your project):Disable Source Control, clean build folder (Alt+Shift+Cmd+K), then Enable Source Control again. Xcode -> Preferences -> Source Control -> Enable Source ControlIn my case, Xcode had somehow found old .svn directories that referenced the missing files. I had to go up a level above my project folder to find those .svn files. Once deleted, I restarted Xcode and everything was fine.I had a similar issue with a handful of files that had long since been deleted from my Xcode project while I was still using Xcode 7.My solution was to:This got rid of the warnings for me.To add onto Alexander Vasenin\'s answer...First I Committed and Pushed my changesXcode Main Menu > Source Control > CommitThen I Discarded All Changes to get rid of the errorsXcode Main Menu > Source Control > Discard All ChangesAfter that, the errors stating "file xxx.png is missing from working copy" disappeared.This is occurred when you delete file on Xcode, but didnt tell svn server about it.Go to command line tool, and delete file directly.and commit itnote that if you delete .svn folder, the warning is disappear but you will lost communication with svn server. I worked it out.just open your third-party SVN tool, find the miss files, Revert;\nthat\'s all.Show on target->build phases -> copy Bundle Resources.\nand\nclean build folder command+shift+alt+kI had same problem and solved it by add git .\nOpen Command Line ToolLater,restart Xcode project and open your project again.I had to manually go into Terminal and remove the files with git rm ProjectPath\\aaa\\xxx.png and then commit. After that everything worked fine.Got this for every project after moving on to XCode 8. This solved it:With Option Key pressed, Product (in title menu) -> Clean Build Folder.In my case, I had wrong data from my old projects in the simulator. Solved by reset content and settings in the simulator:Simulator -> Reset content and settings...I had the warnings, and also could not commit changes under XCode (using svn).  All I had to do was restart XCode and the problem went away.This works for me:\nXcode -> ("option + click") Product -> Clean Build Folder...\nThan restart xCodeFor me the following worked:Since I do not and did never use Git, I created a new project (XCode 8, I could not see the usual "use Git" or however the checkmark was labeled). Then I bluntly deleted all the files in this new project; went to the old messed up project, copied everything in the project folder, came back to the newly created project, pasted the old stuff, opened that - all the warnings about files that have not been existing for months are gone. Fingers crossed.I had the same issue and solved it by simply dragging the specified files from finder into the project navigator (ensuring that "copy files" is selected in the dialog) and committing the files.These warnings are not build warnings, they are about your SVN repository.It is correct that the directories shown no longer exist, CocoaPods stores the headers in Pods/Headers/{Private,Public} now. You have to update your working copy to reflect those changes.In my case I drag & dropped a number of files on my Xcode project window to add them.  It made copies into my source directory but didn\'t put them where I wanted them to go (it put them at the root of my directory, I wanted them in a sub-directory).  Without thinking I just grabbed them in the Finder and moved them to the directory I wanted them in.  After going back into the project window it of course could not find them so I deleted them in the window and re added them.  After compiling I started getting these errors.I thought, as some mention above that it was a git issue but when I ran "git ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD" I didn\'t see the files at all??Anyway to fix it all I did was use the "Add File..." menu command to add each of the files to the default location, do a clean build, and then delete them from the project window (using move to trash) and it got rid of all the errors.In my case it was a problem with git and a case-insensitive file system.I had inadvertently submitted the same file twice, using file paths that differed only in case:Xcode was complaining about one of the missing files.Fixed by deleting the offending files, and re-adding.This is definitely related to source control. I renamed and moved a couple of non-committed plist files and got this error. I am using svn. I was able to fix this via Source Control - Commit by removing old referenced files.
