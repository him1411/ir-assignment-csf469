Yes, I know there\'s AlertDialog.Builder, but I\'m shocked to know how difficult (well, at least not programmer-friendly) to display a dialog in Android.I used to be a .NET developer, and I\'m wondering is there any Android-equivalent of the following?AlertDialog.Builder really isn\'t that hard to use. It\'s a bit intimidating at first for sure, but once you\'ve used it a bit it\'s both simple and powerful. I know you\'ve said you know how to use it, but here\'s just a simple example anyway:You can also reuse that DialogInterface.OnClickListener if you have other yes/no boxes that should do the same thing.If you\'re creating the Dialog from within a View.OnClickListener, you can use view.getContext() to get the Context. Alternatively you can use yourFragmentName.getActivity().Try this:Steve H\'s answer is spot on, but here\'s a bit more information: the reason that dialogs work the way they do is because dialogs in Android are asynchronous (execution does not stop when the dialog is displayed).  Because of this, you have to use a callback to handle the user\'s selection.Check out this question for a longer discussion between the differences in Android and .NET (as it relates to dialogs):\nDialogs / AlertDialogs: How to "block execution" while dialog is up (.NET-style)This is working for me:Steves answer is correct though outdated with fragments. Here is an example with FragmentDialog.The class:To start dialog:You could also let the class implement onClickListener and use that instead of embedded listeners.Thanks nikki your answer has helped me improve an existing simply by adding my desired action as follows Asking a Person whether he wants to call or not Dialog..Thanks. I use the API Level 2 (Android 1.1) and instead of BUTTON_POSITIVE and BUTTON_NEGATIVE i have to use BUTTON1 and BUTTON2.you can implement a generic solution for decisions and use in another case not just for yes/no and custom the alert with animations or layout:Something like this; first create your class for transfer datas:after a interface for return the resultNow you can create an utils for access easily (in this class you can implement different animation or custom layout for the alert):and the last call in activity or fragment; you can use this in you case or for other task:All the answers here boil down to lengthy and not reader-friendly code: just what the person asking was trying to avoid. To me, was the easiest approach is to employ lambdas here:Lambdas in Android require the retrolambda plugin (https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda), but it\'s hugely helpful in writing cleaner code anyways.
