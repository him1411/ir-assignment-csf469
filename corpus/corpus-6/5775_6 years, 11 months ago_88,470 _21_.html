What is the simplest way to obtain an instance of new Date() but set the time at midnight?The setHours method can take optional minutes, seconds and ms arguments, for example:That will set the time to 00:00:00.000 of your current timezone, if you want to work in UTC time, you can use the setUTCHours method.Just wanted to clarify that the snippet from accepted answer gives the nearest midnight in the past:If you want to get the nearest midnight in future, use the following code:Just going to add this here because I landed on this page looking for how to do this in moment.js and others may do too. [Rationale: the word "moment" already appears elsewhere on this page so search engines direct here, and moment.js is widespread enough to warrant to being covered going on how often it is mentioned in other date-related SO questions]So, in version 2.0.0 and above:For earlier versions:Docs:http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/start-of/A one-liner for object configs:When creating an element:Adding usefulness to @Dan\'s example, I had the need to find the next midday or midnight.This allowed me to set a frequency cap for an event, only allowing it to happen once in the morning and once in the afternoon for any visitor to my site. The date captured was used to set the expiration of the cookie.If calculating with dates summertime will cause often 1 uur more or one hour less than midnight (CEST). This causes 1 day difference when dates return. So the dates have to round to the nearest midnight. So the code will be (ths to jamisOn):You can probably use if you need the value only once.In case you already have d3.js as a dependency in your project, or don\'t mind bringing it in, d3-time (d3.js library is modular as of v4.0.0) has got Intervals. They might prove useful when setting dates to "default" values, e.g. midnight, 0.00 seconds, the first of the month, etc.
