Well I am trying to submit a form by pressing enter but not displaying a submit button. I don\'t want to get into JavaScript if possible since I want everything to work on all browsers (the only JS way I know is with events).Right now the form looks like this:Which works pretty well. The submit button works when the user presses enter, and the button doesn\'t show in Firefox, IE, Safari, Opera and Chrome. However, I still don\'t like the solution since it is hard to know whether it will work on all platforms with all browsers.Can anyone suggest a better method? Or is this about as good as it gets?Try:That will push the button waaay to the left, out of the screen. The nice thing with this is, you\'d get graceful degradation when CSS is disabled.Update - Workaround for IE7As suggested by Bryan Downing + with tabindex to prevent tab reach this button (by Ates Goral):I think you should go the Javascript route, or at least I would:Have you tried this ?Since most browsers understand visibility:hidden and it doesn\'t really work like display:none, I\'m guessing that it should be fine, though. Haven\'t really tested it myself, so CMIIW.Another solution without the submit button:HTMLjQueryUse following code, this fixed my problem in all 3 browsers (FF, IE and Chrome):Add above line as a first line in your code with appropriate value of name and value.Instead of the hack you currently use to hide the button, it would be much simpler to set visibility: collapse; in the style attribute. However, I would still recommend using a bit of simple Javascript to submit the form. As far as I understand, support for such things is ubiquitous nowadays.Just set the hidden attribute to true:IE doesn\'t allow pressing the ENTER key for form submission if the submit button is not visible, and the form has more than one field.  Give it what it wants by providing a 1x1 pixel transparent image as a submit button. Of course it will take up a pixel of the layout, but look what you have to do to hide it.This is my solution, tested in Chrome, Firefox 6 and IE7+:The most elegant way of doing this is to keep the submit-button, but set it\'s border, padding and font-size to 0. This will make the button dimensions 0x0.You can try this yourself, and by setting an outline to the element you will see a dot, which is the outside border "surrounding" the 0x0 px element.No need for visibility:hidden, but if it makes you sleep at night, you can throw that in the mix as well.JS Fiddlethe simplest wayFor those who have problems with IE and for others too.You could try also thisYou could include an image with width/height = 0 pxFor anyone looking at this answer in future, HTML5 implements a new attribute for form elements, hidden, which will automatically apply display:none to your element.e.g.I added it to a function on document ready. If there is no submit button on the form (all of my Jquery Dialog Forms don\'t have submit buttons), append it.This works fine and it is the most explicit version of what you\'re trying to achieve.Note that there is a difference between display:none and visibility:hidden for other form elements.I\'ve usedand  in the .css file.\nIt worked magically for me too. :)
