It appears that there is no concept of AUTO_INCREMENT in Oracle, up until and including version 11g.How can I create a column that behaves like auto increment in Oracle 11g?There is no such thing as "auto_increment" or "identity" columns in Oracle as of Oracle 11g. However, you can model it easily with a sequence and a trigger:Table definition:Trigger definition:IDENTITY column is now available on Oracle 12c:or specify starting and increment values, also preventing any insert into the identity column (GENERATED ALWAYS) (again, Oracle 12c+ only)SYS_GUID returns a GUID-- a globally unique ID.  A SYS_GUID is a RAW(16).  It does not generate an incrementing numeric value.If you want to create an incrementing numeric key, you\'ll want to create a sequence.  You would then either use that sequence in your INSERT statementOr you can define a trigger that automatically populates the primary key value using the sequenceIf you are using Oracle 11.1 or later, you can simplify the trigger a bitIf you really want to use SYS_GUIDIn Oracle 12c onward you could do something like,And in Oracle (Pre 12c).Here are three flavors:x is the identity column.  Substitute FOO with your table name in each of the examples.update:Oracle 12c introduces these two variants that don\'t depend on triggers:The first one uses a sequence in the traditional way; the second manages the value internally.Assuming you mean a column like the SQL Server identity column?In Oracle, you use a SEQUENCE to achieve the same functionality.  I\'ll see if I can find a good link and post it here.Update: looks like you found it yourself.  Here is the link anyway:\nhttp://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/sequences.phpOracle Database 12c introduced Identity, an auto-incremental (system-generated) column.\nIn the previous database versions (until 11g), you usually implement an Identity by creating a Sequence and a Trigger.\nFrom 12c onward, you can create your own Table and define the column that has to be generated as an Identity.The following article explains how to use it:Identity columns - A new entry in Oracle Database 12cTrigger and Sequence can be used when you want serialized number that anyone can easily read/remember/understand. But if you don\'t want to manage ID Column (like emp_id) by this way, and value of this column is not much considerable, you can use SYS_GUID() at Table Creation to get Auto Increment like this.Now your emp_id column will accept "globally unique identifier value".\nyou can insert value in table by ignoring emp_id column like this.So, it will insert unique value to your emp_id Column.Starting with Oracle 12c there is support for Identity columns in one of two ways:Sequence + Table - In this solution you still create a sequence as you normally would, then you use the following DDL:CREATE TABLE MyTable\n(ID NUMBER DEFAULT MyTable_Seq.NEXTVAL, \n...)Table Only - In this solution no sequence is explicitly specified. You would use the following DDL:CREATE TABLE MyTable (ID NUMBER GENERATED AS IDENTITY, ...)If you use the first way it is backward compatible with the existing way of doing things. The second is a little more straightforward and is more inline with the rest of the RDMS systems out there. Here is complete solution w.r.t exception/error handling for auto increment, this solution is backward compatible and will work on 11g & 12c, specifically if application is in production.Please replace \'TABLE_NAME\' with your appropriate table nameit is called Identity Columns and it is available only from oracle Oracle 12cexample of insert into Identity Columns as below 1 row created.you can NOT do insert like below ERROR at line 1: ORA-32795: cannot insert into a generated always\n  identity columnERROR at line 1: ORA-32795: cannot insert into a generated always\n  identity columnuseful linkoracle has sequences AND identity columns in 12chttp://www.oracle-base.com/articles/12c/identity-columns-in-oracle-12cr1.php#identity-columnsI found this but not sure what rdb 7 is\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/rdb/0307-identity-columns-128126.pdfThis is how I did this on an existing table and column (named id):only I have to just change the table name (AUDITLOGS) with your table name and new.id with new.column_nameMaybe just try this simple script:http://www.hlavaj.sk/ai.phpResult is:
