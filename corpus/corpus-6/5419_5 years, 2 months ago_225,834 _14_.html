Using jQuery, how can I get the input element that has the caret\'s (cursor\'s) focus?   Or in other words, how to determine if an input has the caret\'s focus?Which one should you use? quoting the jQuery docs:As with other pseudo-class selectors (those that begin with a ":"), it is recommended to precede :focus with a tag name or some other selector; otherwise, the universal selector ("*") is implied. In other words, the bare $(\':focus\') is equivalent to $(\'*:focus\'). If you are looking for the currently focused element, $( document.activeElement ) will retrieve it without having to search the whole DOM tree.The answer is:And if you want a jQuery object wrapping the element:Will retrieve it without having to search the whole DOM tree as recommended on the jQuery documentationTry this:I\'ve tested two ways in Firefox, Chrome, IE9 and Safari.(1). $(document.activeElement) works as expected in Firefox, Chrome and Safari.(2). $(\':focus\') works as expected in Firefox and Safari.I moved into the mouse to input \'name\' and pressed Enter on keyboard, then I tried to get the focused element. (1). $(document.activeElement) returns the input:text:name as expected in Firefox, Chrome and Safari, but it returns input:submit:addPassword in IE9(2). $(\':focus\') returns input:text:name as expected in Firefox and Safari, but nothing in IE
