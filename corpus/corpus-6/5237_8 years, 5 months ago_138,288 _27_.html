Is there a tool that will run a command-line and report how much RAM was used total?I\'m imagining something analogous to /usr/bin/time(This is an already answered, old question.. but just for the record :)I was inspired by Yang\'s script, and came up with this small tool, named memusg.  I simply increased the sampling rate to 0.1 to handle much short living processes.  Instead of monitoring a single process, I made it measure rss sum of the process group. (Yeah, I write lots of separate programs that work together)  It currently works on Mac OS X and Linux.  The usage had to be similar to that of time:It only shows the peak for the moment, but I\'m interested in slight extensions for recording other (rough) statistics.It\'s good to have such simple tool for just taking a look before we start any serious profiling.[Edit: Works on Ubuntu 14.04: /usr/bin/time -v command  Make sure to use the full path.]Looks like /usr/bin/time does give you that info, if you pass -v (this is on Ubuntu 8.10).  See, e.g., Maximum resident set size below:Valgrind one-liner:valgrind --tool=massif --pages-as-heap=yes --massif-out-file=massif.out ./test.sh; grep mem_heap_B massif.out | sed -e \'s/mem_heap_B=\\(.*\\)/\\1/\' | sort -g | tail -n 1Note use of --pages-as-heap to measure all memory in a process. More info here: http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/ms-manual.htmlPerhaps (gnu) time(1) already does what you want.  For instance:But other profiling tools may give more accurate results depending on what you are looking for./usr/bin/time maybe does what you want, actually.  Something like.See time(1) for details...If the process runs for at least a couple seconds, then you can use the following bash script, which will run the given command line then print to stderr the peak RSS (substitute for rss any other attribute you\'re interested in).  It\'s somewhat lightweight, and it works for me with the ps included in Ubuntu 9.04 (which I can\'t say for time).On MacOS Sierra use:You can use grep to take what you want maybe.Well, if you really want to show the memory peak and some more in-depth statistics i recommend using a profiler such as valgrind. A nice valgrind front-end is alleyoop.You can use a tool like Valgrind to do this.Here is (based on the other answers) a very simple script that watches an already running process. You just run it with the pid of the process you want to watch as the argument:Example usage:Use Massif: http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/ms-manual.html\'htop\' is best command for see which process is using how much RAM..... for more detail \nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/htop.1.htmlHeaptrack is KDE tool that has a GUI and text interface. I find it more suitable than valgrind to understand the memory usage of a process because it provides more details and flamegraphs. It\'s also faster because it does less checking that valgrind. And it gives you the peak memory usage.Anyway, tracking rss and vss is misleading because pages could be shared, that\'s why that memusg. What you should really do is track the sum of Pss in /proc/[pid]/smaps or use pmap. GNOME system-monitor used to do so but it was too expensive.
