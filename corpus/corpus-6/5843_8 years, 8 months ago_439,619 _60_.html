I have a tag in my html like this:Using css I want to replace the text with my actual logo. I\'ve got the logo there no problem via resizing the tag and putting a background image in via css. However, I can\'t figure out how to get rid of the text. I\'ve seen it done before basically by pushing the text off the screen. The problem is I can\'t remember where I saw it. This is one way:Here is another way to hide the text while avoiding the huge 9999 pixel box that the browser will create:Why not simply use:Just add font-size: 0; to your element that contains text.The most cross-browser friendly way is to write the HTML asthen use CSS to hide the span and replace the imageIf you can use CSS2, then there are some better ways using the content property, but unfortunately the web isn\'t 100% there yet.See mezzoblue for a nice summary of each technique, with strengths and weaknesses, plus example html and css.In addition to the other answers, here is another useful approach for hiding text.This method effectively hides the text, yet allows it to remain visible for screen readers. This is an option to consider if accessibility is a concern.It\'s worth pointing out that this class is currently used in Bootstrap 3.If you\'re interested in reading about accessibility:Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)MDN Accessibility documentationJeffrey Zeldman suggests the following solution:It should be less resource intensive than -9999px;Please read all about it here: http://www.zeldman.com/2012/03/01/replacing-the-9999px-hack-new-image-replacement/Do not use { display:none; } It makes the content inaccessible.

It is important that you select/develop a technique that meets your needs including: screen readers, images/css/scripting on/off combinations, seo, etc.Here are some good resources to get started down the road of standardista image replacement techniques:http://faq.css-standards.org/Image_Replacementhttp://www.alistapart.com/articles/firhttp://veerle.duoh.com/blog/links/#l-10you can use the css background-image property and z-index to ensure the image stays in front of the text.Why don\'t you use: If you haven\'t any span or div element, it works perfectly for links.The answer is to create a span with the property {display:none;}You can find an example at this siteThe above works well in latest Thunderbird also.Use Condition tag for different browser and using css you have to place \nheight:0px and width:0px also you have to place font-size:0px.If the point is simply to make the text inside the element invisible, set the color attribute to have 0 opacity using a rgba value such as color:rgba(0,0,0,0); clean and simple.Try this code to shorten and hide textor to hide use in your css class .hidetxt { visibility: hidden; }repalce content with the CSSI usually use:If we can edit the markup, life can be easier, just remove text and be happy.

I want to prevent box to be enlarged.Using zero value for font-size and line-height in the element does the trick for me:To hide text from html use text-indent property in css/* for dynamic text you need to add white-space, so your applied css will not disturb. nowrap means text will never wrap to the next line, the text continues on the same line until a <br> tag is encounteredThis worked for me with span (knockout validation).A solution that works for me :HTMLCSS The best answer works for short text, but if the text wraps it just shows up in the image.
