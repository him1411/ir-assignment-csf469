My code works fine for normal devices but creates blurry images on retina devices.Does anybody know a solution for my issue?Switch from use of UIGraphicsBeginImageContext to UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions (as documented on this page). Pass 0.0 for scale (the third argument) and you\'ll get a context with a scale factor equal to that of the screen.UIGraphicsBeginImageContext uses a fixed scale factor of 1.0, so you\'re actually getting exactly the same image on an iPhone 4 as on the other iPhones. I\'ll bet either the iPhone 4 is applying a filter when you implicitly scale it up or just your brain is picking up on it being less sharp than everything around it.So, I guess:The current accepted answer is now out of date, at least if you are supporting iOS 7.Here is what you should be using if you are only supporting iOS7+:As per this article, you can see that the new iOS7 method drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates: is many times faster than renderInContext:. benchmark http://f.cl.ly/items/323c000h013V2f3R2p3b/Screen%20Shot%202013-09-16%20at%2001.12.37%20.pngI have created a Swift extension based on @Dima solution:The usageTo improve answers by @Tommy and @Dima, use the following category to render UIView into UIImage with transparent background and without loss of quality. Working on iOS7. (Or just reuse that method in implementation, replacing self reference with your image)The Swift 3 solution (based on Dima\'s answer) with UIView extension should be like this:\nSwift 2.0:Using extension method:Usage:All Swift 3 answers did not worked for me so I have translated the most accepted answer:Drop-in Swift 3.0 extension that supports the new iOS 10.0 API & the previous method.Note:Some times drawRect Method makes problem so I got these answers more appropriate. You too may have a look on it\nCapture UIImage of UIView stuck in DrawRect method In this method just pass a view object and it will returns a UIImage object.Add this to method to UIView Category
