Say I\'ve forked a node module with a bugfix and I want to use my fixed version, on a feature branch of course, until the bugfix is merged and released. What would I scribble into the dependencies of my package.json?From the npm docs:per @dantheta\'s comment:As of npm 1.1.65, Github URL can be more concise user/project. npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html You can attach the branch like user/project#branchSoOr for tag v1.12.0 on jscs:Note, if you use npm --save, you\'ll get the longer git From https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#git-urls-as-dependenciesGit URLs as DependenciesGit urls can be of the form:git://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish\n  git+ssh://user@hostname:project.git#commit-ish\n  git+ssh://user@hostname/project.git#commit-ish\n  git+http://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish\n  git+https://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish The commit-ish\n  can be any tag, sha, or branch which can be supplied as an argument to\n  git checkout. The default is master.GitHub URLsAs of version 1.1.65, you can refer to GitHub urls as just "foo":\n  "user/foo-project". Just as with git URLs, a commit-ish suffix can be\n  included. For example:{   "name": "foo",\n      "version": "0.0.0",\n      "dependencies": {\n        "express": "visionmedia/express",\n        "mocha": "visionmedia/mocha#4727d357ea"\n    } }If you want to use devel or feature branch, or you haven\xe2\x80\x99t published a certain package to the NPM registry, or you can\xe2\x80\x99t because it\xe2\x80\x99s a private module, then you can point to a git:// URI instead of a version number in your package.json:The #ref portion is optional, and it can be a branch (like master), tag (like 0.0.1) or a partial or full commit id.On latest version of NPM you can just do:npm install gitAuthor/gitRepo#tagIf the repo is a valid NPM package it will be auto-aliased in package.json as:{\n  "NPMPackageName": "gitAuthor/gitRepo#tag"\n}If you could add this to @justingordon \'s answer there is no need for manual aliasing now !
