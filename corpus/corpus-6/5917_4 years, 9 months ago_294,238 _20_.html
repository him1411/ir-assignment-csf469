Is there a built-in IsNullOrEmpty-like function in order to check if a string is null or empty, in PowerShell?I could not find it so far and if there is a built-in way, I do not want to write a function for this.You can use the IsNullOrEmpty static method:You guys are making this too hard.  PowerShell handles this quite elegantly e.g.:In addition to [string]::IsNullOrEmpty in order to check for null or empty you can cast a string to a Boolean explicitly or in Boolean expressions:Output:If it is a parameter in a function, you can validate it with ValidateNotNullOrEmpty as you can see in this example:Personally, I do not accept a whitespace ($STR3) as being \'not empty\'.When a variable that only contains whitespaces is passed onto a parameter, it will often error that the parameters value may not be \'$null\', instead of saying it may not be a whitespace, some remove commands might remove a root folder instead of a subfolder if the subfolder name is a "white space", all the reason not to accept a string containing whitespaces in many cases.I find this is the best way to accomplish it:EmptyEmptyEmpty!! :-)Not emptyI have a PowerShell script I have to run on a computer so out of date that it doesn\'t have [String]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace(), so I wrote my own.Check the length. If the object exists, it will have a length. Null objects have no length, do not exist, and cannot be checked.String object have a length.The question was: IsNull or IsEmpty, NOT IsNull or IsEmpty or IsWhiteSpaceNote that the "if($str)" and "IsNullOrEmpty" tests don\'t work comparably in all instances: an assignment of $str=0 produces false for both, and depending on intended program semantics, this could yield a surprise.
