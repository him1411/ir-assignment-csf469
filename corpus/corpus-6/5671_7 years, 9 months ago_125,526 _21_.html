I\'m looking for some good tools/scripts that allow me to generate a few statistics from a git repository. I\'ve seen this feature on some code hosting sites, and they contained information like...Basically I just want to get an idea how much my project grows over time, which developer commits most code, and so on.Beside GitStats (git history statistics generator) mentioned by xyld, written in Python and requiring Gnuplot for graphs, there is also commits per authorI\'m doing a git repository statistics generator in ruby, it\'s called git_stats.You can find examples generated for some repositories on project page.Here is a list of what it can do:If you have any idea what to add or improve please let me know, I would appreciate any feedback.I tried http://gitstats.sourceforge.net/, starts are very interesting.Once git clone git://repo.or.cz/gitstats.git is done, go to that folder and say gitstats <git repo location> <report output folder> (create a new folder for report as this generates lots of files)Here is a quick list of stats from this:A quick google search lead me to: http://gitstats.sourceforge.net/Have you tried this project?  I\'m sure there are similar projects.If your project is on GitHub, you now (April 2013) have Pulse (see "Get up to speed with Pulse"):It is more limited, and won\'t display all the stats you might need, but is readily available for any GitHub project.Pulse is a great way to discover recent activity on projects.\n  Pulse will show you who has been actively committing and what has changed in a project\'s default branch:You can find the link to the left of the nav bar.Note that there isn\'t (yet) an API to extract that information.And if you prefer hosted solution, you should check out Open Hub (formerly Ohloh.net). It is nice, but don\'t expect large statistics.
