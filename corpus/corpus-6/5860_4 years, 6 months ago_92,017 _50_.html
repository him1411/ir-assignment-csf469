Once I change the DEBUG = False, my site will generate 500 (using wsgi & manage.py runserver), and there is no error info in Apache error log and it will run normally when I change debug to True .I\'m using Django 1.5 & Python 2.7.3\nhere is Apache access log and without any log in apache error logHere is my settings file:Django 1.5 introduced the allowed hosts setting that is required for security reasons. A settings file created with Django 1.5 has this new section which you need to add:Add your host here like [\'www.beta800.net\'] or [\'*\'] for a quick test, but don\'t use [\'*\'] for production.In my case, reading docs of third party apps properly saved me. The culprit? django_compressorI had DEBUG = True always gave me 500. To fix it, I needed a line in my settings to get it runningRight, in Django 1.5 if DEBUG = False, configure ALLOWED_HOSTS, adding domains without the port number. example: You must also check your URLs all over the place. When the DEBUG is set to False, all URLs without trailing / are treated as a bug, unlike when you have DEBUG = True, in which case Django will append / everywhere it is missing. So, in short, make sure all links end with a slash EVERYWHERE.I know this is late but I ended up here with a search for my error 500 with DEBUG=False, in my case it did turn out to be the ALLOWED_HOSTS but I was using os.environ.get(\'variable\') to populate the hosts, I did not notice this until I enabled logging, you can log all errors to file with the below and it will log even when DEBUG=False:I have a hilarious story for all. After reaching this page I said "Eureka! I\'m saved. That MUST be my problem." So I inserted the required ALLOWED_HOSTS list in setting.py and... nothing. Same old 500 error. And no, it wasn\'t for lack of a 404.html file.So for 2 days I busied myself with wild theories, such as that it had something to do with serving static files (understand that I am a noob and noobs don\'t know what they\'re doing).So what was it? It is now Mr. Moderator that we come to a useful tip. Whereas my development Django is version 1.5.something, my production server version is 1.5.something+1... or maybe plus 2. Whatever. And so after I added the ALLOWED_HOSTS to the desktop version of settings.py, which lacked what hwjp requested--- a "default value in settings.py, perhaps with an explanatory comment"--- I did the same on the production server with the proper domain for it.But I failed to notice that on the production server with the later version of Django there WAS a default value in settings.py with an explanatory comment. It was well below where I made my entry, out of sight on the monitor. And of course the list was empty. Hence my waste of time.I faced the same problem when I did DEBUG = FALSE. Here is a consolidated solution as scattered in answers above and other posts.By default, in settings.py we have ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] . Here are possible changes you will have to make in ALLOWED_HOSTS value as per scenario to get rid of the error:1: Your domain name:2: Your deployed server IP if you don\'t have domain name yet (which was my case and worked like a charm):3: If you are testing on local server, you can edit your settings.py or settings_local.py as:4: You can also provide \'*\' in the ALLOWED_HOSTS value but its not recommended in the production environment due to security reasons: I have also posted a detailed solution on my blog which you may want to refer.ALLOWED_HOSTS is NOT the only issue, for me I had to make a 404.html and put it in the base level of my templates (not app level) - Also, you can make a 404 view and add a 404handler url but I think thats optional. 404.html fixed itin mainproject.urlsin app.viewsthen make a templates/404.html templategot this from another S/O post that I cannot find itEDITalso, I get 500 errors when I serve assets with whitenoise. Could not figure that out for the life of me, error was ValueError from whitenoise not being able to find an asset that I also could not find, had to go with default django serving for nowFor what it\'s worth - I was getting a 500 with DEBUG = False on some pages only. Tracing back the exception with pdb revealed a missing asset (I suspect the {% static ... %} template tag was the culprit for the 500.Complementing the main answer\nIt is annoying to change the ALLOWED_HOSTS and DEBUG settings when working in production or development\nI am using this code to set these setting automaticallyI know that this is a super old question, but maybe I could help some one else.  If you are having a 500 error after setting DEBUG=False, you can always run the manage.py runserver in the command line to see any errors that wont appear in any web error logs.I think it could also be the http server settings. Mine is still broken and had ALLOWED_HOSTS the entire time. I can access it locally (i use gunicorn), but not via the domain name when DEBUG=False. when I try using the domain name it then gives me the error, so makes me think its a nginx related issue.Here is my conf file for nginx:I have the similar issue, in my case it was caused by having a Commented script inside the body tag. I was searching and testing more about this issue and I realized that static files direcotiries specified in settings.py can be a cause of this, so fist, we need to run this commandin settings.py, the code should look something like this:I know this is an old question, but I was also getting a 500 error when DEBUG=False. After several hours, I realized I had forgot to end some of the links in my base.html with a trailing slash. This is old and my problem ended up being related to the problem but not for the OP but my solution is for anyone else who tried the above to no avail. I had a setting in a modified version of Django to minify CSS and JS files that only ran when DEBUG was off. My server did not have the CSS minifier installed and threw the error. If you are using Django-Mako-Plus, this might be your issue.One small thing to note, If the array has None in it, then all the subsequent allowed hosts are ignored.Django version 1.8.4A bit late to the party, and off course there could be a legion of issues but I\'ve had a similar issue and it turned out that I had {% %} special characters inside my html remark...I had one view that threw a 500 error in debug=false but worked in debug=true. For anyone who is getting this kind of thing and Allowed Hosts is not the problem, I fixed my view by updating a template\'s static tag that was pointing to the wrong location. So I\'d suggest just checking links and tags are airtight in any templates used, maybe certain things slip through the net in debug but give errors in production.I ran into this issue. Turns out I was including in the template, using the static template tag, a file that did not exist anymore. A look in the logs showed me the problem.I guess this is just one of many possible reasons for this kind of error. Moral of the story: always log errors and always check logs.If you want to allow for all hosts. \nUse ALLOWED_HOSTS = [\'*\',] \ninstead of \nALLOWED_HOSTS = [\'*\']
