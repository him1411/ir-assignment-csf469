With javascript how can I add a query string parameter to the url if not present or if it present, update the current value? I am using jquery for my client side development.I wrote the following function which accomplishes what I want to achieve:I have expanded the solution and combined it with another that I found to replace/update/remove the querystring parameters based on the users input and taking the urls anchor into consideration.Not supplying a value will remove the parameter, supplying one will add/update the parameter. If no URL is supplied, it will be grabbed from window.locationUPDATEThere was a bug when removing the first parameter in the querystring, I have reworked the regex and test to include a fix.Second UpdateAs suggested by @Jar\xc3\xb3nBarends - Tweak value check to check against undefined and null to allow setting 0 valuesThird UpdateThere was a bug where removing a querystring variable directly before a hashtag would lose the hashtag symbol which has been fixedFourth UpdateThanks @rooby for pointing out a regex optimization in the first RegExp object.\nSet initial regex to ([?&]) due to issue with using (\\?|&) found by @YonatanKarniFifth UpdateRemoving declaring hash var in if/else statementBased on @amateur\'s answer (and now incorporating the fix from @j_walker_dev comment), but taking into account the comment about hash tags in the url I use the following:Edited to fix [?|&] in regex which should of course be [?&] as pointed out in the commentsEdit: Alternative version to support removing URL params as well.  I have used value === undefined as the way to indicate removal.  Could use value === false or even a separate input param as wanted.See it in action at https://jsfiddle.net/bp3tmuxh/1/Here is my library to do that: https://github.com/Mikhus/jsurlThe URLSearchParams utility can be useful for this in combination with window.location.search. For example:Now foo has been set to bar regardless of whether or not it already existed. However, the above assignment to window.location.search will cause a page load, so if that\'s not desirable use the History API as follows:Now you don\'t need to write your own regex or logic to handle the possible existence of query strings. However, browser support is poor as it\'s currently experimental and only in use in recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, iOS Safari, Android Browser, Android Chrome and Opera. Use with a polyfill if you do decide to use it.Update: Browser support has improved since my original answer.window.location.search is read/write.However - modifying the query string will redirect the page you\'re on and cause a refresh from the server.If what you\'re attempting to do is maintain client side state (and potentially make it bookmark-able), you\'ll want to modify the URL hash instead of the query string, which keeps you on the same page (window.location.hash is read/write). This is how web sites like twitter.com do this.You\'ll also want the back button to work, you\'ll have to bind javascript events to the hash change event, a good plugin for that is http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/Here\'s my approach: The location.params() function (shown below) can be used as a getter or setter.  Examples:Given the URL is http://example.com/?foo=bar&baz#some-hash,Here is the params() function, which can optionally be assigned to the window.location object.If it\'s not set or want to update with a new value you can use:This is in simple Javascript, by the way.EDITYou may want to try using the jquery query-object pluginwindow.location.search =\n  jQuery.query.set("param", 5);I know this is quite old but i want to fires my working version in here.NOTE This is a modified version of @elreimundoThis is my preference, and it covers the cases I can think of. Can anyone think of a way to reduce it to a single replace?I realize this question is old and has been answered to death, but here\'s my stab at it. I\'m trying to reinvent the wheel here because I was using the currently accepted answer and the mishandling of URL fragments recently bit me in a project.The function is below. It\'s quite long, but it was made to be as resilient as possible. I would love suggestions for shortening/improving it. I put together a small jsFiddle test suite for it (or other similar functions). If a function can pass every one of the tests there, I say it\'s probably good to go.Update: I came across a cool function for using the DOM to parse URLs, so I incorporated that technique here. It makes the function shorter and more reliable. Props to the author of that function.My take from here (compatible with "use strict"; does not really use jQuery):Example usage:Based on the answer @ellemayo gave, I came up with the following solution that allows for disabling of the hash tag if desired:Call it like this:Results in:Here is a shorter version that takes care of Code:The regex description can be found here.NOTE: This solution is based on @amateur answer, but with many improvements.To give an code example for modifying window.location.search as suggested by Gal and tradyblix:Java script code to find a specific query string and replace its value *Yeah I had an issue where my querystring would overflow and duplicate, but this was due to my own sluggishness. so I played a bit and worked up some js jquery(actualy sizzle) and C# magick.So i just realized that after the server has done with the passed values, the values doesn\'t matter anymore, there is no reuse, if the client wanted to do the same thing evidently it will always be a new request, even if its the same parameters being passed. And thats all clientside, so some caching/cookies etc could be cool in that regards.JS:HTML:C#:Okay criticism is welcome (this was a nightly concoction so feel free to note adjustments). If this helped at all, thumb it up, Happy Coding.No duplicates, each request as unique as you modified it, and due to how this is structured,easy to add more queries dynamicaly from wthin the dom.Here\'s an alternative method using the inbuilt properties of the anchor HTML element:if you want to set multiple parameters at once:same function as @amateur\'sif jslint gives you an error add this after the for loopThere are a lot of awkward and unnecessarily complicated answers on this page. The highest rated one, @amateur\'s, is quite good, although it has a bit of unnecessary fluff in the RegExp. Here is a slightly more optimal solution with cleaner RegExp and a cleaner replace call:As an added bonus, if uri is not a string, you won\'t get errors for trying to call match or replace on something that may not implement those methods.And if you want to handle the case of a hash (and you\'ve already done a check for properly formatted HTML), you can leverage the existing function instead of writing a new function containing the same logic:Or you can make some slight changes to @Adam\'s otherwise excellent answer:This should serve the purpose: A different approach without using regular expressions. Supports \'hash\' anchors at the end of the url as well as multiple question mark charcters (?). Should be slightly faster than the regular expression approach.
