Below is how I would have previously truncated a float to two decimal placesI checked the docs and the eBook but haven\'t been able to figure it out. Thanks!My best solution so far, following from David\'s response:I think this is the most Swift-like solution, tying the formatting operations directly to the data type. It may well be that there is a built-in library of formatting operations somewhere, or maybe it will be released soon. Keep in mind that the language is still in beta.a simple way is:I found String.localizedStringWithFormat to work quite well:Example:This is a very fast and simple way who doesn\'t need complex solution.Most answers here are valid. However, in case you will format the number often, consider extending the Float class to add a method that returns a formatted string. See example code below. This one achieves the same goal by using a number formatter and extension.The console shows:You can\'t do it (yet) with string interpolation.  Your best bet is still going to be NSString formatting:Extrapolating from python, it seems like a reasonable syntax might be:Which then allows you to use them as:You can define similar operators for all of the numeric types, unfortunately I haven\'t found a way to do it with generics.A more elegant and generic solution is to rewrite ruby / python % operator:Why make it so complicated? You can use this instead:See it work in Playground.PS: Solution from: http://rrike.sh/xcode/rounding-various-decimal-places-swift/You can still use NSLog in Swift as in Objective-C just without the @ sign.Edit: After working with Swift since a while I would like to add also this variationOutput:here a "pure" swift solutionThe answers given so far that have received the most votes are relying on NSString methods and are going to require that you have imported Foundation.Having done that, though, you still have access to NSLog.So I think the answer to the question, if you are asking how to continue using NSLog in Swift, is simply:import FoundationPower of extensionOutput:\nThe velocity is 12.3less typing way:Also with rounding:use below methodA version of Vincent Guerci\'s ruby / python % operator, updated for Swift 2.1:You can also create an operator in this way I don\'t know about two decimal places, but here\'s how you can print floats with zero decimal places, so I\'d imagine that can be 2 place, 3, places ... (Note: you must convert CGFloat to Double to pass to String(format:) or it will see a value of zero)Swift2 example: Screen width of iOS device formatting the Float removing the decimalPlenty of good answers above, but sometimes a pattern is more appropriate than the "%.3f" sort of gobbledygook. Here\'s my take using a NumberFormatter in Swift 3.Here I wanted 2 decimals to be always shown, but the third only if it wasn\'t zero.@Christian Dietrich:instead of:it could also be:[correction:]\nSorry for confusion* - Of course this works with Doubles. I think, most practical (if you want digits to be rounded, not cut off) it would be something like that:For Float only, simply replace Double with Float, pow with powf and round with roundf.\nUpdate: I found that it is most practical to use return type Double instead of String. It works the same for String output, i.e.:  prints: Pi is roughly 3.142\nSo you can use it the same way for Strings (you can even still write: println(d ~> 2)), but additionally you can also use it to round values directly, i.e.:  or whatever you need \xe2\x80\xa6
