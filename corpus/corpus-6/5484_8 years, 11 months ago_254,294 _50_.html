I am trying to use the Directory.GetFiles() method to retrieve a list of files of multiple types, such as mp3\'s and jpg\'s.  I have tried both of the following with no luck:Is there a way to do this in one call?For .NET 4.0 and later, For earlier versions of .NET,edit: Please read the comments. The improvement that Paul Farry suggests, and the memory/performance issue that Christian.K points out are both very important.How about this:I found it here (in the comments): http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wz42302f.aspxIf you have a large list of extensions to check you can use the following. I didn\'t want to create a lot of OR statements so i modified what lette wrote.forYou could:But the real benefit of EnumerateFiles shows up when you split up the filters and merge the results:It gets a bit faster if you don\'t have to turn them into globs (i.e. exts = new[] {"*.mp3", "*.jpg"} already).Performance evaluation based on the following LinqPad test (note: Perf just repeats the delegate 10000 times)\nhttps://gist.github.com/zaus/7454021( reposted and extended from \'duplicate\' since that question specifically requested no LINQ: Multiple file-extensions searchPattern for System.IO.Directory.GetFiles )I know it\'s old question but LINQ:  (.NET40+)Another way to use Linq, but without having to return everything and filter on that in memory.It\'s actually 2 calls to GetFiles(), but I think it\'s consistent with the spirit of the question and returns them in one enumerable.Nope. Try the following:Taken from: http://blogs.msdn.com/markda/archive/2006/04/20/580075.aspxLetThenorI can\'t use .Where method because I\'m programming in .NET Framework 2.0 (Linq is only supported in .NET Framework 3.5+). Code below is not case sensitive (so .CaB or .cab will be listed too).There is also a descent solution which seems not to have any memory or performance overhead and be quite elegant:The following function searches on multiple patterns, separated by commas.  You can also specify an exclusion, eg: "!web.config" will search for all files and exclude "web.config".  Patterns can be mixed.Usage:Just found an another way to do it.  Still not one operation, but throwing it out to see what other people think about it.Make the extensions you want one string i.e ".mp3.jpg.wma.wmf" and then check if each file contains the extension you want.\nThis works with .net 2.0 as it does not use LINQ.The advantage with this approach is you can add or remove extensions without editing the code i.e to add png images, just write myExtensions=".jpg.mp3.png".Nop... I believe you have to make as many calls as the file types you want. I would create a function myself taking an array on strings with the extensions I need and then iterate on that array making all the necessary calls. That function would return a generic list of the files matching the extensions I\'d sent.Hope it helps.in .NET 2.0 (no Linq):Then use it:What aboutI had the same problem and couldn\'t find the right solution so I wrote a function called GetFiles:This function will call Directory.Getfiles() only one time.For example call the function like this:EDIT: To get one file with multiple extensions use this one:For example call the function like this:I wonder why there are so many "solutions" posted?If my rookie-understanding on how GetFiles works is right, there are only two options and any of the solutions above can be brought down to these:GetFiles, then filter: Fast, but a memory killer due to storing overhead untill the filters are appliedFilter while GetFiles: Slower the more filters are set, but low memory usage as no overhead is stored.This is explained in one of the above posts with an impressive benchmark: Each filter option causes a seperate GetFile-operation so the same part of the harddrive gets read several times.In my opinion Option 1) is better, but using the SearchOption.AllDirectories on folders like C:\\ would use huge amounts of memory.\nTherefor i would just make a recursive sub-method that goes through all subfolders using option 1)This should cause only 1 GetFiles-operation on each folder and therefor be fast (Option 1), but use only a small amount of memory as the filters are applied afters each subfolders\' reading -> overhead is deleted after each subfolder.Please correct me if I am wrong. I am as i said quite new to programming but want to gain deeper understanding of things to eventually become good at this :)Or you can just convert the string of extensions to String^i don t know what solution is better, but i use this:
