I have an application that I just would like to use in portrait mode, so I have defined\nandroid:screenOrientation="portrait" in the manifest XML. This works OK for the HTC Magic phone (and prevents orientation changes on other phones as well).But I have a problem with the HTC G1 phone as I open the hardware QWERTY keyboard (not the virtual keyboard). My activity stays in portrait mode, but it seems to get restarted and loses all its states. This does not happen with the HTC Hero version.My application is quite big, so I don\'t want it to restart and lose all its states when the keyboard is opened. How can I prevent that?Update April 2013: Don\'t do this. It wasn\'t a good idea in 2009 when I first answered the question and it really isn\'t a good idea now. See this answer by hackbod for reasons: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5336057/84021Add android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation" to your AndroidManifest.xml. This tells the system what configuration changes you are going to handle yourself - in this case by doing nothing.See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#configChanges for more details.However, your application can be interrupted at any time, e.g. by a phone call, so you really should add code to save the state of your application when it is paused.Update: As of Android 3.2, you also need to add "screenSize":From http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html#HandlingTheChange:Caution: Beginning with Android 3.2 (API level 13), the "screen size"\n  also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape\n  orientation. Thus, if you want to prevent runtime restarts due to\n  orientation change when developing for API level 13 or higher (as\n  declared by the minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion attributes), you\n  must include the "screenSize" value in addition to the "orientation"\n  value. That is, you must declare\n  android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize". However, if your\n  application targets API level 12 or lower, then your activity always\n  handles this configuration change itself (this configuration change\n  does not restart your activity, even when running on an Android 3.2 or\n  higher device).You need to modify AndroidManifest.xml as Intrications (previously Ashton) mentioned and make sure the activity handles the onConfigurationChanged event as you want it handled. This is how it should look:I\'ve always found you need both As said, set android:configChanges of your Activity (in manifest file) to keyboardHidden|orientation and then:1) Override onConfigurationChanged()2) Add this line to your activity\'s onCreate()It\'s better than add same line to onConfigurationChanged, because your app will turn to portrait mode and then back to landscape (it will happen only one time, but it\'s annoying). Also you can set android:screenOrientation="nosensor" for your activity (in manifest). But using this way you\'re a not able to handle orientation changes at all.Use this..In OnCreate method of your activity use this code:Now your orientation will be set to portrait and will never change.In the AndroidManifest.xml file, for each activity you want to lock add the last screenOrientation line:Or android:screenOrientation="landscape".In your androidmanifest.xml file:orTo lock the screen by code you have to use the actual rotation of the screen (0, 90, 180, 270) and you have to know the natural position of it, in a smartphone the natural position will be portrait and in a tablet, it will be landscape.Here\'s the code (lock and unlock methods), it has been tested in some devices (smartphones and tablets) and it works great.In Visual Studio Xamarin:using Android.Content.PM; to you activity namespace list.[Activity(ScreenOrientation = Android.Content.PM.ScreenOrientation.Portrait)]as an attribute to you class, like that:Addto your manifest.Please note, none of the methods seems to work now!In Android Studio 1 one simple way is to add\nandroid:screenOrientation="nosensor".This effectively locks the screen orientation.
