I have a rather involved Visual Studio solution (2010, but it shouldn\'t matter) that I need to rename.I want to rename the folders to match the new solution name, but I can\'t figure out a way to refactor the folder names automatically, and going through every single project file will be painful.Is there an official way to do this? Alternatively (and much less preferably), are there free tools to accomplish this?Manually edit .sln fileThis method is entirely aimed at renaming the directory for the project, as viewed in Windows Explorer.This method does not suffer from the problems in the Remove/add project file method below (references disappearing), but it can result in problems if your project is under source control (see notes below). This is why step 2 (backup) is so important.You can also see renaming solution manually or post which describes this manual process.AdvantagesWarningsUpdate 2014-11-02ReSharper has added an automated method for achieving the same result as the manual method above. If the namespace is underlined with a squiggly blue line, click on the action pyramid icon to either:In the second case, the final word defines the new directory name in Windows Explorer, e.g. if we changed the namespace to ViewModel2, it would offer to move the file to folder ViewModel2.However, this will not necessarily update files in source control, so you may still have to use the manual method.Update 2017-01-10Tested with Visual Studio 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2015 Update 1, 2, 3.Here are steps you need to follow to rename a solution:Change the AssemblyTitle and AssemblyProduct in\nProperties/AssemblyInfo.cs.Delete bin and obj directories physically.Rename the project physical folder directory.Open the SLN file (within notepad or any editor) and change the path\nto the project.Clean and Rebuild the project. The Rename operations in visual studio only change the filename, i.e. for a project, *.prj and for a solution *.sln.  You will need to rename folders seperately using the filesystem, and you will need to remove and readd the projects since they will have new foldernames.  However, note that the solution and project files are respectively texst and xml files.  You could write your own program that parses them and renames both the folder names, filenames, and fixes the project/solution files internally.You can also export template and then create a new project from the exported template changing the name as you preferDelete your bin and obj subfolders to remove a load of incorrect reference then use windows to search for old name.Edit any code or xml files found and rebuild, should be ok now.Below is a step-by-step way of renaming your entire solution in Visual Studio 2013Assuming we\'re changing a project named "HelloWorld.ui" to "Section1to5.ui"Right click on the Project that you have just renamed, and click on "Properties". Under the Application tab, change the "Assembly name" and "Default namespace".In the main Program.cs file (or any other code files that you may have created), rename the namespace declaration to use the new name. For this right-click the namespace and select Refactor > Rename enter a new name. For example:namespace HelloWorld.ui ----> namespace Section1to5.uiNext, expand the "Properties" and double click on AssemblyInfo.cs file. You will notice the below code fragment:You need to change the AssemblyTitle and AssemblyProduct in Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs to the new name, in this example from "HelloWorld.ui" to "Section1to5.ui". Once you\'re done changing the name, save and close Visual Studio.In the project directory, go inside the folder "HelloWorld.ui" and delete the "bin" and "obj" directories.Once you\'re done, rename the folder "HelloWorld.ui" to the new project name.Open the renamed solutions file with a text editor such as Notepad or Notepad++ and edit the following line:Project("{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}") = "HelloWorld.ui", "HelloWorld.ui\\HelloWorld.ui.csproj", "{39FC65A3-3AE7-4EC9-B8F7-74F971636C70}"Replace all the instances of "HelloWorld.ui" the new name that you\'ve selected for your project, in this case "Section1to5.ui". This changes the path of the project to the renamed directory in step 6.Open the solutions file with visual studio, and clean and rebuild the project.You may notice that the "Debug/Run" button has been replaced by the "Attach" button. If this happens, simply right click on the project and choose the "Set as StartUp project" option. Alternatively, click on  Tools>Customize>Commands>Add command>Debug and add the button.You\'re done renaming the project, if you have any doubts feel free to post and I\'d be glad to help out!Using the "Find in Files" function of Notepad++ worked fine for me (ctrl +  H, Find in Files).http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.2.2.htmlI tried the Visual Studio Project Renamer, but, it threw exceptions in the few cases where I tried it.I have had good success with CopyWiz.I am in no way affiliated with them, and I have not yet paid for it, but I may have to soon, as it is the only tool that seems to work for both my C# and C++ projects. I do hope they make a little money, and continue to improve it, though.Remove/add project file methodThis method is entirely aimed at renaming the directory for the project, as viewed in Windows Explorer.AdvantagesDisadvantagesRight clicking on a project and selecting "Open Folder in Windows Explorer" is useful to keep track of where the project is stored while you are performing this process.If you are Creating a Website in Visual Studio 2010. You can change the project name as follows.Step 1: In Visual Studio 2010 the SLN file will be stored under project folder within Visual studio 2010 and Source files are stored under Website folder within Visual Studio 2010.Step 2: Rename the folder by right click on that folder forward by Rename which contains your SLN project.Step 3: Rename the SLN file name by right click on that SLN file forward by Rename.Step 4: Rename the folder that contains Source of that SLN file under Website in Visual Studio 2010.Step 5: Then finally Double click Your SLN file and change the root of your SLN source folder.The only solution which works for me on Visual Studio 2013 in a WEB project:Lets say I want to rename "project1" to be "project2".\nLets say the physical path to my .sln file is:\nc:\\my\\path\\project1\\project1.slnso the path to my .csproj file as well as the bin and the obj folders should be:\nc:\\my\\path\\project1\\project1\\Open the solution in VS by double clicking the project1.sln file.In Solution Explorer, right-click the project (NOT the solution!!!), select Rename, and enter a new name.In Solution Explorer, right-click the project and select Properties. On the Application tab, change the "Assembly name" and "Default namespace".In the main CS file (or any other code files like Global.asax for example), rename the namespace declaration to use the new name. For this right-click the namespace and select Refactor > Rename enter a new name. For example:namespace project14.1 In Solution Explorer, right-click the project (NOT the solution!!!), select Rename, and enter a new name.1\n[assembly: AssemblyTitle("New Name Here")]\n2\n[assembly: AssemblyDescription("")]\n3\n[assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("")]\n4\n[assembly: AssemblyCompany("")]\n5\n[assembly: AssemblyProduct("New Name Here")]\n6\n[assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright \xc2\xa9  2013")]\n7\n[assembly: AssemblyTrademark("")]\n8\n[assembly: AssemblyCulture("")]Close the Visual Studio.Delete bin and obj directories physically.Rename the parent folder and the source folder to the new name (project2):In the example:\nc:\\my\\path\\project1\\project1will be:\nc:\\my\\path\\project2\\project2Rename the SLN file name by right click on that SLN file forward by Rename.Then finally open the SLN file (within notepad or any editor) and copy and replace (Ctrl+h) any old name to the new name.Open VS and click BUILD -> Clean Solution click Build -> Build solution and then F5 to run...Note1: If you get something like this: Compilation Error\nCS0246: The type or namespace name \'project2\' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)Source File: c:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Temporary ASP.NET Files\\root\\78dd917f\\d0836ce4\\App_Web_index.cshtml.a8d08dba.b0mwjmih.0.csThen go to the "Temporary ASP.NET Files" folder and delete everything.I\'m new to VS. I just had that same problem: Needed to rename an started project after a couple weeks work. This what I did and it worked. Maybe more steps but less or no typing at all, just some mouse clicks.
