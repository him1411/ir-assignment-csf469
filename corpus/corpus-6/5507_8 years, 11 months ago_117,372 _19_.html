I\'m testing the speed of some queries in MySQL. The database is caching these queries making it difficult for me to get reliable results when testing how fast these queries are.Is there a way to disable caching for a query?System: MySQL 4 on Linux webhosting, I have access to PHPMyAdmin.ThanksTry using the SQL_NO_CACHE (MySQL 5.7) option in your query.\n(MySQL 5.6 users click HERE )eg.This will stop MySQL caching the results, however be aware that other OS and disk caches may also impact performance. These are harder to get around.Another alternative that only affects the current connection:Any reference to current date/time will disable the query cache for that selection:See "Prerequisites and Notes for MySQL Query Cache Use" @ http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/mysql-query-cache.htmlThere is also configuration option: query_cache_size=0To disable the query cache at server startup, set the query_cache_size system variable to 0. By disabling the query cache code, there is no noticeable overhead. If you build MySQL from source, query cache capabilities can be excluded from the server entirely by invoking configure with the --without-query-cache option.See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/query-cache.htmlYou can also run the follow command to reset the query cache.One problem with the method is that it seems to only prevent the result of your query from being cached.  However, if you\'re querying a database that is actively being used with the query you want to test, then other clients may cache your query, affecting your results.  I am continuing to research ways around this, will edit this post if I figure one out.I\'d Use the following:If you want to disable the Query cache set the \'query_cache_size\' to 0 in your mysql configuration file . If its set 0 mysql wont use the query cache.Using a user-defined variable within a query makes the query resuts uncacheable. I found it a much better indicator than using SQL_NO_CACHE. But you should put the variable in a place where the variable setting would not seriously affect the performance:
