Is there a way to simply uninstall all unused(undeclared) dependencies from a Node.js project (ones that are no longer defined in my package.json.) When I update my application I like to have the unreferenced packages removed automatically.Run npm prune to unbuild modules not listed in package.json.From npm help prune:This command removes "extraneous" packages.  If a package name is provided, then only packages matching one of the supplied names are removed.Extraneous packages are packages that are not listed on the parent package\'s dependencies list.If the --production flag is specified, this command will remove the packages specified in your devDependencies.If you\'re not worried about a couple minutes time to do so, a solution would be to rm -rf node_modules and npm install again to rebuild the local modules.
