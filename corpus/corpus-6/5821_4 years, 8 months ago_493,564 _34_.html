Given the following select elementIs there a way to get MAGIC_THING to be equal to the currently selected size, so I have access to size.name and size.code in my controller?size.code affects a lot of the other parts of the app (image urls, etc), but when the ng-model of item.size.code is updated, item.size.name needs to be updated as well for the user facing stuff. I assume that the correct way to do this is capturing the change event and setting the values inside of my controller, but I\'m not sure what I can pass into update to get the proper values.If this is completely the wrong way to go about it, I\'d love to know the right way.Instead of setting the ng-model to item.size.code, how about setting it to size:Then in your update() method, $scope.item will be set to the currently selected item.And whatever code needed item.size.code, can get that property via $scope.item.code.Fiddle.Update based on more info in comments:Use some other $scope property for your select ng-model then:Controller:You can also directly get selected value using following codescript.jsyou also coud try this:If Divyesh Rupawala\'s answer doesn\'t work (passing the current item as the parameter), then please see the onChanged() function in this Plunker.  It\'s using this:http://plnkr.co/edit/B5TDQJThis might give you some ideas  .NET C# View Model .NET C# Web Api ControllerAngular Controller:Angular Template:\xc4\xb0f you want to write, name, id, class, multiple, required , You can write in this way.AngularJS\'s Filter worked out for me.Assuming the code/id is unique, we can filter out that particular object with AngularJS\'s filter and work with the selected objects properties. Considering the example above:Now, there are 3 important aspects to this:ng-init="search.code = item.size.code" - on initializing h1 element outside select box, set the filter query to the selected option.ng-change="update(MAGIC_THING); search.code = item.size.code" - when you change the select input, we\'ll run one more line which will set the "search" query to the currently selected item.size.code.filter:search:true - Pass true to filter to enable strict matching.That\'s it.  If the size.code is uniqueID, we\'ll have only one h1 element with the text of size.name.I\'ve tested this in my project and it works.Good LuckYou need to use "track by" so that the objects can be compared correctly. Otherwise Angular will use the native js way of comparing objects.So your example code would change to -
