I\'m looking at some Python code which used the @ symbol, but I have no idea what it does. I also do not know what to search for as searching Python docs or Google does not return relevant results when the @ symbol is included.The @ symbol is used for class, function and method decorators.Read more here:PEP 318: DecoratorsPython DecoratorsThe most common Python decorators you\'ll run into are:@property@classmethod@staticmethodI admit it took more than a few moments to fully grasp this concept for me, so I\'ll share what I\'ve learned to save others the trouble.The name decorator - the thing we define using the @ syntax before a function definition - was probably the main culprit here.What this shows is that the function/method/class you\'re defining after a decorator is just basically passed on as an argument to the function/method immediatelly after the @ sign.The microframework Flask introduces decorators from the very beginning in the following format:This in turn translates to:Realizing this finally allowed me to feel at peace with flask.This code snippet:Is equivalent to this code:In the definition of decorator you can add some modified things that wouldn\'t be returned by function normally.In python3.5 you can overload @ as an operator. It is named as __matmul__ because It is designed to do matrix multiplication, but It can be anything you want. see PEP465 for details.This is a simple implementation of matrix multiplication.  This code yields When I began to answer I didn\'t saw the first answer, is exactly that than you need, respectly in java is a different concept and as you can read for example here java, annotation tutorialIn java this is an annotation and as you can read is used is completely different than in python sorry for the trouble.Edit: Original post and as said in the comments I made a mistake with the option I choose.\nIt is a decorator like in the Java language you use it with for the declaration and use of abstract methods. The difference is than in Python the abstract method could have an implementation.Definition from docs.python.orgStarting with Python 3.5, the \'@\' is used as a dedicated infix symbol for MATRIX MULTIPLICATION (PEP 0465 -- see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/)It indicates that you are using a decorator. Here is Bruce Eckel\'s example from 2008.To say what others have in a different way:  yes, it is a decorator.In Python, it\'s like:This can be used for all kinds of useful things, made possible because functions are objects and just necessary just instructions.In short, it is used in decorator syntax and for matrix multiplication.I also do not know what to search for as searching Python docs or Google does not return relevant results when the @ symbol is included.If you want to have a rather complete view of what a particular piece of python syntax does, look directly at the grammar file. For the Python 3 branch:We can see here that @ is used in three contexts:A google search for "decorator python docs" gives as one of the top results, the "Compound Statements" section of the "Python Language Reference." Scrolling down to the section on function definitions, which we can find by searching for the word, "decorator", we see that... there\'s a lot to read. But the word, "decorator" is a link to the glossary, which tells us:A function returning another function, usually applied as a function transformation using the @wrapper syntax. Common\n  examples for decorators are classmethod() and staticmethod().The decorator syntax is merely syntactic sugar, the following two\n  function definitions are semantically equivalent:The same concept exists for classes, but is less commonly used there.\n  See the documentation for function definitions and class definitions\n  for more about decorators.So, we see thatis semantically the same as:They are not exactly the same because Python evaluates the foo expression (which could be a dotted lookup and a function call) before bar with the decorator (@) syntax, but evaluates the foo expression after bar in the other case.(If this difference makes a difference in the meaning of your code, you should reconsider what you\'re doing with your life, because that would be pathological.)If we go back to the function definition syntax documentation, we see:is roughly equivalent toThis is a demonstration that we can call a function that\'s a decorator first, as well as stack decorators. Functions, in Python, are first class objects - which means you can pass a function as an argument to another function, and return functions. Decorators do both of these things.If we stack decorators, the function, as defined, gets passed first to the decorator immediately above it, then the next, and so on.That about sums up the usage for @ in the context of decorators.In the lexical analysis section of the language reference, we have a section on operators, which includes @, which makes it also an operator:The following tokens are operators:and in the next page, the Data Model, we have the section, emulating numeric types, [...]\n  These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic operations (+, -, *, @, /, //, [...]And we see that __matmul__ corresponds to @. If we search the documentation for "matmul" we get a link to What\'s new in Python 3.5 with "matmul" under a heading "PEP 465 - A dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication".it can be implemented by defining __matmul__(), __rmatmul__(), and\n  __imatmul__() for regular, reflected, and in-place matrix multiplication.(So now we learn that @= is the in-place version). It further explains:Matrix multiplication is a notably common operation in many fields of\n  mathematics, science, engineering, and the addition of @ allows\n  writing cleaner code:instead of:While this operator can be overloaded to do almost anything, in numpy, for example, we would use this syntax to calculate the inner and outer product of arrays and matrices:While researching the prior usage, we learn that there is also the inplace matrix multiplication. If we attempt to use it, we may find it is not yet implemented for numpy:When it is implemented, I would expect the result to look like this:
