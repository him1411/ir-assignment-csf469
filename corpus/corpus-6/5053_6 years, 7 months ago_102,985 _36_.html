Other than the obvious fact that the first form could use a variable and not just a string literal, is there any reason to use one over the other, and if so under which cases?In code:Context: I\'ve written a code generator which produces these expressions and I\'m wondering which is preferable.(Sourced from here.)Square bracket notation allows the use of characters that can\'t be used with dot notation:Secondly, square bracket notation is useful when dealing with\n property names which vary in a predictable way:Roundup:Another example of characters that can\'t be used with dot notation is property names that themselves contain a dot.For example a json response could contain a property called bar.Baz.The bracket notation allows you to access properties by name stored in a variable:obj.x would not work in this case.Generally speaking, they do the same job.\nNevertheless, the bracket notation gives you the opportunity to do stuff that you can\'t do with dot notation, likeThis can be extended to any property containing special characters.Dot notation does not work with some keywords (like new and class) in internet explorer 8.I had this code:And this triggers the dreaded "expected indentifier" (at least on IE8 on windows xp, I havn\'t tried other environments). The simple fix for that is to switch to bracket notation:Be careful while using these notations:\nFor eg. if we want to access a function present in the parent of a window.\nIn IE :is not equivalent to We may either use: or to access itBracket notation can use variables, so it is useful in two instances where dot notation will not work:1) When the property names are dynamically determined (when the exact names are not known until runtime).2) When using a for..in loop to go through all the properties of an object. source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_ObjectsYou need to use brackets if the property names has special characters:Other than that, I suppose it\'s just a matter of taste. IMHO, the dot notation is shorter and it makes it more obvious that it\'s a property rather than an array element (although of course JavaScript does not have associative arrays anyway).The two most common ways to access properties in JavaScript are with a dot and with square brackets. Both value.x and value[x] access a property on value\xe2\x80\x94but not necessarily the same property. The difference is in how x is interpreted. When using a dot, the part after the dot must be a valid variable name, and it directly names the property. When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is evaluated to get the property name. Whereas value.x fetches the property of value named \xe2\x80\x9cx\xe2\x80\x9d, value[x] tries to evaluate the expression x and uses the result as the property name.So if you know that the property you are interested in is called \xe2\x80\x9clength\xe2\x80\x9d, you say value.length. If you want to extract the property named by the value held in the variable i, you say value[i]. And because property names can be any string, if you want to access a property named \xe2\x80\x9c2\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Doe\xe2\x80\x9d, you must use square brackets: value[2] or value["John Doe"]. This is the case even though you know the precise name of the property in advance, because neither \xe2\x80\x9c2\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Doe\xe2\x80\x9d is a valid variable name and so cannot be accessed through dot notation.In case of ArraysThe elements in an array are stored in properties. Because the names of these properties are numbers and we often need to get their name from a variable, we have to use the bracket syntax to access them. The length property of an array tells us how many elements it contains. This property name is a valid variable name, and we know its name in advance, so to find the length of an array, you typically write array.length because that is easier to write than array["length"].Case where [] notation is helpful :If your object is dynamic and there could be some random values in keys like number and []or any other special character, for example -var a = { 1 : 3 };Now if you try to access in like a.1 it will through an error, because it is expecting an string over there.Let me add some more use case of the square-bracket notation. If you want to access a property say x-proxy in a object, then - will be interpreted wrongly. Their are some other cases too like space, dot, etc., where dot operation will not help you. Also if u have the key in a variable then only way to access the value of the key in a object is by bracket notation. Hope you get some more context.
