I followed this guide to create a new JS to flash communication:So my code looks like:Now sometimes, my onChange does not load, but currently, firebug displays a me.onChange is not a functionerror and completely stops. I want it to degrade gracefully because this is not the most important feature in my program. I tried typeof but that still gives the same error.Any suggestions on how to make sure that it exists and then only execute onChange?(None of the methods below except try catch one work)Try something like this:or better yet (as per UpTheCreek upvoted comment)I had this problem.kept throwing a reference error if obj happened to be undefined.In the end I did the following:A colleague pointed out to me that checking if it\'s !== \'undefined\' and then === \'function\' is redundant of course.Simpler:Much cleaner and works great.Edit: I do not pretend to know the reason(s) why this answer is the accepted one. Please instead use the solution proposed in Andrew Hare\'s answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1042154/42346Here is one way to handle this kind of situation:If you\'re using eval to convert a string to function, and you want to check if this eval\'d method exists, you\'ll want to use typeof and your function string inside an eval:Don\'t reverse this and try a typeof on eval. If you do a ReferenceError will be thrown:Try typeof -- Look for \'undefined\' to say it doesn\'t exist, \'function\' for a function. JSFiddle for this codeOr as an if:Or with a return value, on a single line:I\'ll go 1 step further to make sure the property is indeed a functionHow about:e.g. or as for your case:See MDN docs.I like using this method:Usage:Didn\'t see this suggested:\n    me.onChange && me.onChange(str);Basically if me.onChange is undefined (which it will be if it hasn\'t been initiated) then it won\'t execute the latter part. If me.onChange is a function, it will execute me.onChange(str).You can even go further and do:in case me is async as well.With no conditionsI would suspect that me is not getting correctly assigned onload.Moving the get_ID call into the onclick event should take care of it.Obviously you can further trap as previously mentioned:I always check like this:just place it before any code that uses this functionThe Underscore.js library defines it in the isFunction method as this (which comments suggest may cater for some browser bugs)http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-143This simple jQuery code should do the trick:I had the case where the name of the function varied according to a variable (var \'x\' in this case) added to the functions name. This works:I have tried the accepted answer; however:returns \'undefined\'.\nI\'ve noticed that the specification states an event called \'onchange\' instead of \'onChange\' (notice the camelCase).Changing the original accepted answer to the following worked for me:If you\'re checking for a function that is a jQuery plugin, you need to use $.fn.myfunction
