I am looking to write an app that receives pushed alerts from a server. I found a couple of methods to do this.  Each has its own limitations. SMS- no guarantee on arrival time. Poll may drain the battery.Do you have a better suggestion please? Thanks very much.Google\'s official answer is the Android Cloud to Device Messaging Framework (deprecated) Google Cloud Messaging(deprecated) Firebase Cloud MessagingIt will work on Android >= 2.2 (on phones that have the Play Store).(cross-posting from an answer I gave to a similar question - Does Android support near real time push notification? )I recently started playing with MQTT http://mqtt.org for Android as a way of doing this sort of thing (i.e. push notification that is not SMS but data driven, almost immediate message delivery, not polling, etc.)I have a blog post with background information on this in case it\'s helpful http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=938(Note: MQTT is an IBM technology, and I should point out that I work for IBM.)Android Cloud to Device Messaging FrameworkImportant: C2DM has been officially deprecated as of June 26, 2012. This means that C2DM has stopped accepting new users and quota requests. No new features will be added to C2DM. However, apps using C2DM will continue to work. Existing C2DM developers are encouraged to migrate to the new version of C2DM, called Google Cloud Messaging for Android (GCM). See the C2DM-to-GCM Migration document for more information. Developers must use GCM for new development. Kindly check the following link:http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm/index.htmlHere I have written few steps for How to Get RegID and Notification starting from scratchYou can find complete tutorial in below URL linkGetting Started with Android Push Notification : Latest Google Cloud\n  Messaging (GCM) - step by step complete tutorialCode snip to get Registration ID (Device Token for Push Notification).Configure project for GCM For enable GCM in our project we need to add few permission in our manifest file\nGo to AndroidManifest.xml and add below code\nAdd PermissionAdd GCM Broadcast Receiver declarationadd GCM Broadcast Receiver declaration in your application tagAdd GCM Servie declarationNow Go to your Launch/Splash Activity Add Constants and Class VariablesUpdate OnCreate and OnResume methodsNote : please store REGISTRATION_KEY, it is important for sending PN Message to GCM\nalso keep in mine this will be unique for all device, by using this only GCM will send Push Notification.Add GCM Broadcast Receiver ClassAs we have already declared \xe2\x80\x9cGcmBroadcastReceiver.java\xe2\x80\x9d in our Manifest file, So lets create this class\nupdate receiver class code this wayAdd GCM Service ClassAs we have already declared \xe2\x80\x9cGcmBroadcastReceiver.java\xe2\x80\x9d in our Manifest file, So lets create this class\nupdate receiver class code this wayMy understanding/experience with Android push notification are:C2DM GCM - If your target android platform is 2.2+, then go for it. Just one catch, device users have to be always logged with a Google Account to get the messages. MQTT - Pub/Sub based approach, needs an active connection from device, may drain battery if not implemented sensibly.Deacon - May not be good in a long run due to limited community support.Edit: Added on November 25, 2013GCM - Google says...For pre-3.0 devices, this requires users to set up their Google account on their mobile devices. A Google account is not a requirement on devices running Android 4.0.4 or higher.*There is a new open-source effort to develop a Java library for push notifications on Android based on the Meteor web server. You can check it out at the Deacon Project Blog, where you\'ll find links to Meteor and the project\'s GitHub repository. We need developers, so please spread the word!You can use Xtify (http://developer.xtify.com) - they have a push notifications webservice that works with their SDK.  it\'s free and so far, it\'s worked really well for me.or....  3) Keep a connection to the server, send keep-alives every few minutes, and the server can push messages instantly. This is how Gmail, Google Talk, etc. works.I recommend using GCM - Google Cloud Messaging for Android\nIt\'s free, and for simple uses it\'s should be very easy.However it requires to maintain a 3rd side server to send the notifications on your behalf.\nIf you want to avoid that there are some very good industrial solutions for Android push notifications service:Diclaimer - I work in PushApps and also use their product in my applications for over a year now.As of 18/05/2016 Firebase is Google\'s unified platform for mobile developers including push notifications.I\'m afraid you\'ve found both possible methods.  Google was, at least initially, going to implement a GChat api you could use for a push/pull implementation.  Sadly, that library was cut by Android 1.0.I dont know if this is still useful. I achieved something like this with a java library at http://www.pushlets.com/Althoug doing it in a service won\'t prevent android from shutting it down an killing the listener thread.Google C2DM is depreciated now, for that, you have o use the new service GCM (Google Cloud Messaging). For documantation, see http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm/gs.htmlC2DM: your app-users must have the gmail account.MQTT: when your connection reached to 1024, it will stop work because of it used "select model " of linux.There is a free push service and api for android, you can try it: http://push-notification.orgFree and easy method:If your target user base is not large(less than a 1000) and you want a free service to start with, then Airbop is the best and most convenient.Airbop Website \nIt uses Google Cloud Messaging service through its API and is provides a good performance. i have used it for two of my projects and it was easy implementing it.Services like  and Urbanship are excellent but provide an entire deployment stack and not just the push notifications thing. If only push service is your target, Airbop will work fine.I haven\'t used Pushwoosh, but is also a great choice. It allows push to 1,000,000 devices for freeI would suggest using both SMS and HTTP. If the user is not signed in send their phone an SMS to notify them there\'s a message waiting.That\'s how this Ericsson Labs service works: https://labs.ericsson.com/apis/mobile-java-push/If you implement this yourself the tricky part is deleting the incoming SMS without the user seeing it. Or maybe it\'s ok if they see it in your case.Looks like this works:\nDeleting SMS Using BroadCastReceiver - AndroidYes, writing code like this can be dangerous and you can potentially ruin someone\'s life because your application deleted an SMS it shouldn\'t have.You can use Google Cloud Messaging or GCM, it\'s free and easy to use. Also you can use third party push servers like PushWoosh which gives you more flexibilityThere\'s a lot a third party servers like Urban Airship, Xtify, Mainline, ... whiches allow send not only on Android, but also on iOs, Windows Phone ...
