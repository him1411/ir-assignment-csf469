An Intent is an "intention" to perform an action; in other words,a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app componentAn Intent is basically a message to say you did or want something to happen. Depending on the intent, apps or the OS might be listening for it and will react accordingly. Think of it as a blast email to a bunch of friends, in which you tell your friend John to do something, or to friends who can do X ("intent filters"), to do X. The other folks will ignore the email, but John (or friends who can do X) will react to it.To listen for an broadcast intent (like the phone ringing, or an SMS is received), you implement a broadcast receiver, which will be passed the intent. To declare that you can handle another\'s app intent like "take picture", you declare an intent filter in your app\'s manifest file.If you want to fire off an intent to do something, like pop up the dialer, you fire off an intent saying you will.An Intent is basically a message that is passed between components (such as Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers). So, it is almost equivalent to parameters passed to API calls. The fundamental differences between API calls and invoking components via intents are:Of course, Intents can be made to work exactly like API calls by using what are called explicit intents, which will be explained later. But more often than not, implicit intents are the way to go and that is what is explained here.One component that wants to invoke another has to only express its intent to do a job. And any other component that exists and has claimed that it can do such a job through intent-filters, is invoked by the Android platform to accomplish the job. This means, neither components is not aware of each other\'s existence but can still work together to give the desired result for the end-user.This invisible connection between components is achieved through the combination of intents, intent-filters and the Android platform.This leads to huge possibilities like:Here are additional technical details about Intents from the Android documentation.An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed. It can be used with startActivity to launch an Activity, broadcastIntent to send it to any interested BroadcastReceiver components, and startService(Intent) or bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int) to communicate with a Background Service.An Intent provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, where it can be thought of as the glue between activities. It is basically a passive data structure holding an abstract description of an action to be performed. The primary pieces of information in an intent are:Intents are a way of telling Android what you want to do. \nIn other words, you describe your intention. Intents can be used to signal to the Android system that a certain event has occurred. Other components in Android can register to this event via an intent filter.Following are 2 types of intentsused to call a specific component. When you know which component you want to launch and you do not want to give the user free control over which component to use. For example, you have an application that has 2 activities. Activity A and activity B. You want to launch activity B from activity A. In this case you define an explicit intent targeting activityB and then use it to directly call it. used when you have an idea of what you want to do, but you do not know which component should be launched. Or if you want to give the user an option to choose between a list of components to use. If these Intents are send to the Android system it searches for all components which are registered for the specific action and the data type. If only one component is found, Android starts the component directly. For example, you have an application that uses the camera to take photos. One of the features of your application is that you give the user the possibility to send the photos he has taken. You do not know what kind of application the user has that can send photos, and you also want to give the user an option to choose which external application to use if he has more than one. In this case you would not use an explicit intent. Instead you should use an implicit intent that has its action set to ACTION_SEND and its data extra set to the URI of the photo.An explicit intent is always delivered to its target, no matter what it contains; the filter is not consulted. But an implicit intent is delivered to a component only if it can pass through one of the component\'s filtersIf an Intents is send to the Android system, it will determine suitable applications for this Intents. If several components have been registered for this type of Intents, Android offers the user the choice to open one of them.This determination is based on IntentFilters. An IntentFilters specifies the types of Intent that an activity, service, orBroadcast Receiver can respond to. An Intent Filter declares the capabilities of a component. It specifies what anactivity or service can do and what types of broadcasts a Receiver can handle. It allows the corresponding component to receive Intents of the declared type. IntentFilters are typically defined via the AndroidManifest.xml file. For BroadcastReceiver it is also possible to define them in coding. An IntentFilters is defined by its category, action and data filters. It can also contain additional metadata.If a component does not define an Intent filter, it can only be called by explicit Intents. Following are 2 ways to define a filterIf you define the intent filter in the manifest, your application does not have to be running to react to the intents defined in it\xe2\x80\x99s filter. Android registers the filter when your application gets installed.If you want your broadcast receiver to receive the intent only when your application is running. Then you should define your intent filter during run time (programatically). Keep in mind that this works for broadcast receivers only.After writing a single activity, there comes a need to transition to another activity to perform another task either with or without information from the first activity.Android platform allows transition by means of Intent Interface.Words are taken from here: Using Intent Demo and i suggest you to go through this example  because they also have provided a code file as well. so you can use it and easily understand the same.An Android application can contain zero or more activities. When your application has more than one activity, you may need to navigate from one activity to another. In Android, you navigate between activities through what is known as an intent.An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed. It can be used with startActivity to launch an Activity, broadcastIntent to send it to any interested BroadcastReceiver components, and startService(Intent) or bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int) to communicate with a background Service.For more details see these links :1).  http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html2)  http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/intents/intents-filters.html3). http://www.vogella.de/articles/AndroidIntent/article.htmlthere are many more articles are available. According to their documentation:An Intent is an object that provides runtime binding between separate components (such as two activities). The Intent represents an app\xe2\x80\x99s "intent to do something." You can use intents for a wide variety of tasks, but most often they\xe2\x80\x99re used to start another activity.Here is the link with example:\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/starting-activity.html#BuildIntentAs the document describes, in order to start an activity (you also need to understand what activity is) use the intent like belowAndroid Intent lets you navigate from one android activity to another. With examples, this tutorial also talks about various types of Android intents.Android Intent can be defined as a simple message objects which is used to communicate from 1 activity to another.Intents define intention of an Application . They are also used to transfer data between activities.An Android Intent can be used to perform following 3 tasks :Intent can be broadly classified into 2 categories. There are no keywords for this category and just a broad classification of how android intents are used.Explicit Android IntentExplicit Android Intent is the Intent in which you explicitly define the component that needs to be called by Android System.Implicit Android IntentImplicit Android Intents is the intent where instead of defining the exact components, you define the action you want to perform. The decision to handle this action is left to the operating system. The OS decides which component is best to run for implicit intents. \nLet us see an example:For more information you may visit belowhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.htmlwhat is Intent ? It is a kind of message or information that is passed to the components. It is used to launch an activity, display a web page, send sms, send email etc. There are two types of intents in android:Implicit Intent\n  Explicit IntentImplicit intent is used to invoke the system componentsExampleExplicit intent is used to invoke the activity class.ExampleIntent intent = newIntent (this, SecondActivity.class);you can read more http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidIntent/article.html#intents_overview\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.htmlYou can think of an intent as an \xe2\x80\x9cintent to do something\xe2\x80\x9d. It\xe2\x80\x99s a type of\nmessage that allows you to bind separate objects (such as activities) together\nat runtime. If one activity wants to start a second activity, it does it by\nsending an intent to Android. Android will start the second activity and\npass it the intent.Head First Android DevelopmentTo understand intents basically I would suggest you to go through the site:\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/intents/intents-filters.htmlAlso, I\'ve discussed about intents with examples in my personal blog:\nhttp://androiddesk.wordpress.com/2011/12/24/explicit-intent/ http://androiddesk.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/implicit-intent/Just have a look if you think would be useful..Thank youAn Intent is a class,that is bind the information for doing some actions.example:passing data one activity to another actvity when user perform such actions in present activity.Intent is an intention to perform an operation.In detail you can referhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.htmlAlso, in my blog http://emergingandroidtech.blogspot.in/2014/11/what-is-intent-in-android.htmlTake a look if it is helpful for you.Thank you. Intents are objects of the android.content.Intent type. Your code can send them to the Android system defining the components you are targeting. For example via the startActivity() method you can define that the intent should be used to start an activity.An intent can contain data via a Bundle. This data can be used by the receiving component.Different types of intentsenter code here\nAndroid supports explicit and implicit intents.An application can define the target component directly in the intent (explicit intent) or ask the Android system to evaluate registered components based on the intent data (implicit intents).Intents are asynchronous messages which allow application components to request functionality from other Android components. Intents allow you to interact with components from the same applications as well as with components contributed by other applications. For example, an activity can start an external activity for taking a picture.Intents are objects of the android.content.Intent type. Your code can send them to the Android system defining the components you are targeting. For example, via the startActivity() method you can define that the intent should be used to start an activity.An intent can contain data via a Bundle. This data can be used by the receiving component.\nTo start an activity, use the method startActivity(intent). This method is defined on the Context object which Activity extends.In a broad view, we can define Intent asWhen one Activity wants to start another activity it creates an Object\n  called Intent that specifies which Activity it wants to start.An Android application can contain zero or more activities. When your application has more than one activity, you often need to navigate from one to another. In Android, you navigate between activities through what is known as an intent. You can pass some data to the activity which you want to start through intent, by using putExtra().From the paper Deep Dive into Android IPC/Binder Framework atAndroid Builders Summit 2013 linkThe intent is understood in some small but effective linesFrom this thread a simple answer of android architect Dianne Hackborn states it as a data container which it actually is.From android architecture point of view :Intent is a data container that is used for inter process communication. It is built on top of the Binder from android architecture point of view.  Intents are used to initiate another activity from one activity.It is basically used for several purposes such as sending data to another activity from one activity,and for triggering purposes.They are basically of two typesImplicit intents.Explicit intents.As a beginner I know this much,I think this will give some basic idea about android intents
