I have a style rule I want to apply to a tag when it has two styles. Is there any way to perform this without JavaScript? In other words:I want to apply my style rule only if the li has both .left and .ui-class-selector classes applied.You mean two classes? "Chain" the selectors (no spaces between them):This selects all elements with class1 that also have class2.In your case:Official documentation : CSS2 class selectors.As akamike points out a problem with this method in Internet Explorer 6 you might want to read this: Use double classes in IE6 CSS?Chain selectors are not limited just to classes, you can do it for both classes and ids. ClassesClass & IdId & IdAll good current browsers support this except IE 6, it selects based on the last selector in the list. So ".classA.classB" will select based on just ".classB".For your caseor
