I\'ve created this script to calculate the date for 10 days in advance in the format of dd/mm/yyyy:I need to have the date appear with leading zeroes on the day and month component by way of adding these rules to the script. I can\'t seem to get it to work.andIf someone could show me where to insert these into the script I would be really appreciative.Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/xA5B7/EDIT:To explain, .slice(-2) gives us the last two characters of the string.So no matter what, we can add "0" to the day or month, and just ask for the last two since those are always the two we want.So if the MyDate.getMonth() returns 9, it will be:so adding .slice(-2) on that gives us the last two characters which is:But if MyDate.getMonth() returns 10, it will be:so adding .slice(-2) gives us the last two characters, or:Here is an example from the Date object docs on the Mozilla Developer Network using a custom "pad" function, without having to extend Javascript\'s Number prototype. The handy function they give as an example isAnd below is it being used in context.You can define a "str_pad" function (as in php)://in use:You could use ternary operator to format the date like an "if" statement.For example:Sowould be similar to an if statement, where if the getDate() returns a value less than 10, then return a \'0\' + the Date, or else return the date if greater than 10 (since we do not need to add the leading 0).  Same for the month.Edit:\nForgot that getMonth starts with 0, so added the +1 to account for it.  Of course you could also just say d.getMonth() < 9 :, but I figured using the +1 would help make it easier to understand.I wrapped the correct answer of this question in a function that can add multiple leading zero\'s but defaults to adding 1 zero.for working with numbers only and not more than 2 digits, this is also an approach:Make your life easier and use Moment.js some sample code:The following aims to extract configuration, hook into Date.protoype and apply configuration. I\'ve used an Array to store time chunks and when I push() this as a Date object, it returns me the length to iterate. When I\'m done, I can use join on the return value.This seems to work pretty fast: 0.016msdemo: http://jsfiddle.net/tive/U4MZ3/What I would do, is create my own custom Date helper that looks like this :(see also this Fiddle)Another option, using a built-in function to do the padding (but resulting in quite long code!):And another, manipulating strings with regular expressions:But be aware that one will show the year at the start and the day at the end.I found the shorterst way to do this:will add leading zeros to all lonely, single digits
