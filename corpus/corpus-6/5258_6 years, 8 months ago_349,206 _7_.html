Is there an if-else tag available in JSTL?Yes, but it\'s clunky as hell, e.g.For simple if-else you can use ternary operator like thisThere is no if-else, just if.Optionally you can use choose-when:I got away with simply using two if tags, thought I\'d add an answer in case it\'s of use to anyone else:whilst technically not an if-else per se, the behaviour is the same and avoids the clunky approach of using the choose tag, so depending on how complex your requirement is this might be preferable.
