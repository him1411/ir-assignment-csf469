What exactly is the difference between margin and padding in CSS? It really doesn\'t seem to serve much purpose. Could you give me an example of where the differences lie (and why it is important to know the difference)?padding is the space between the content and the border, whereas margin is the space outside the border. Here\'s an image I found from a quick Google search, that illustrates this idea.One key thing that is missing in the answers here:Top/Bottom margins are collapsible.So if you have a 20px margin at the bottom of an element and a 30px margin at the top of the next element, the margin between the two elements will be 30px rather than 50px. This does not apply to left/right margin or padding.Margin is applied to the outside of you element hence effecting how far your element is away from other elements.  Padding is applied to the inside of your element hence effecting how far your element\'s content is away from the border.Also, using margin will not affect your element\'s dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions (set height + padding) so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5 px padding, your div will actually be 105x105pxThe simplest defenition is ;\n padding is a space given inside the border of the container element and margin is given outside. \nFor a element which is not a container, padding may not make much sense, but margin defenitly will help to arrange it.PaddingPadding is a CSS property that defines the space between an element content and its border (if it has a border). If an element has a border around it, padding will give space from that border to the element content which appears in that border. If an element does not have a border around it, then adding padding has no effect at all on that element, because there is no border to give space from.MarginMargin is a CSS property that defines the space of outside of an element to its next outside element.Margin affects elements that both have or do not have borders. If an element has a border, margin defines the space from this border to the next outer element. If an element does not have a border, then margin defines the space from the element content to the next outer element.Difference Between Padding and MarginSo the difference between margin and padding is that while padding deals with the inner space, margin deals with the outer space to the next outer element.Remember these 3 points:Demo Image:(where red box is desire control)\nPadding is space inside the border, whereas Margin is space outside the border.margin = space around (outside) the element from border outwards.padding = space around (inside) the element from text to border.see here: http://jsfiddle.net/robx/GaMpq/Margin is space outside the box; padding is space inside the box. It\'s hard to see the difference with a white fill, but with a colored fill you can see it fine.Margin and padding are both types of padding really....One (margin) goes outside of the elements border to distance it from other elements and the other (padding) goes outside of the elements content to distance the content from the elements border.Padding allows the developer to maintain space between the text and it\'s enclosing element. Margin is the space that the element maintains with another element of the parent DOM.See example:One of the key differences between margin and padding is not mentioned in any of the answers: clickability and hover detection Increasing the padding increases the effective size of the element. Sometimes I have a smallish icon that I don\'t want to make visibly larger but the user still needs to interact with that icon.  I increase the icon\'s padding to give it a larger footprint for clicks and hover.  Increasing the icon\'s margin will not have the same effect.An answer to another question on this topic gives an example.Try putting a background color on a block div with width and height. You\'ll see that padding increases the size of the element, whereas margin just moves it within the flow of the document.Margin is specifically for shifting the element around.There is one important difference:Margin- is on the outside of the element i.e. one will apply the whitespace shift "after" the element begins.\nPadding- is on the inside, the other will apply the whitespace "before" the element begins.Margin is applied to the outside of you element hence effecting how far your element is away from other elements.Padding is applied to the inside of your element hence effecting how far your element\'s content is away from the border.Also, using margin will not affect your element\'s dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions (set height + padding) so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5 px padding, your div will actually be 105x105pxPadding is the space between nearest components on the web page and margin is the space from the margin of the webpage. It is great to know about the different between margin and padding. They have some differences:Tip: You can see these differences on some tags that you use to control other tags; like div and span, or section and article. Also is good to see changes in navigation bars.Note: I don\'t know reason of that differences. So you should ask this from the developer(s) of CSS!See the main answer on another questionHave a nice coding!Basically, the difference between padding and margin come in terms of the background. Padding will decide the space between content, while margin decide the outside edge of elements!Padding is the space between you content and the border. Where as Margin is the space between the border and the other element.
