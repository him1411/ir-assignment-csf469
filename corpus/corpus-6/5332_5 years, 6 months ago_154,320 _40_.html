Recently discovered that even while logged into my personal laptop as Admin, Visual Studio does not run in admin mode and you need to explicitly use Run As Admin Is there a way to Make it run as Admin by default other than creating a shortcut etc. ?Copied and pasted from here, the Using Advanced Properties section. This will allow you to always have the program run as an administrator when you open it.Windows 7 :NOTE: If you are doing this is while logged in as standard user instead of an administrator, then you will need to provide the administrator\'s password before the program will run as administrator.Update :   (2015-07-05)In Windows 8, you have to right-click devenv.exe and select "Troubleshoot compatibility".select "Troubleshoot program"check "The program requires additional permissions"\nclick "Next", click "Test the program..."wait for the program to launchclick "Next"select "Yes, save these settings for this program"click "Close"Update Refrence orginal LinkRight click on the application, Props -> Compatibility -> Check the Run the program as administratorApplying this change will make it so that when you double click on a .sln file Visual Studio will not open.  Also, you will not be able to drag and drop files into Visual Studio.Follow the numbered instructions for each file in the bullited list. The paths are for a standard 64-bit install so you may have to adjust them for your system.C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exethere is no advanced tab anymore. So, to do it automatically, you need to follow the next steps :-right click on the shortcut\n-click on properties\n-under the "Shortcut" tab, click on "Open File Location"\n-then, right click on devenv.exe\n-Troubleshoot compatibility\n-Troubleshoot program\n-Check "The program requires additional permissions"\n-Then next, next next,...Follow these simple steps:On windows 10: select "Yes, save these settings for this program"Select "Close"Once that is done, Visual studio should be running as administrator. One time fix :Right-click the icon, then click Properties. In the properties window, go to the Compatibility tab. There should be a checkbox labeled "Run this program as an administrator." Check that, then click OK. The next time you run the application from that shortcut, it will automatically run as the admin.Right click on icon --> Properties --> Advanced --> Check checkbox run as Administrator and everytime it will open under Admin Mode (Same for Windows 8)I have always done it by creating a shortcut, which is not really much of a problem. I believe there is no way of doing it otherwise.For Windows 8 You will find Run As administrator (Checkbox)@Kumar"W7 prompts everytime to run this program "devenv.exe" , anyway to get rid of that ?"Yes. You can prevent Windows from prompting you by going to Control Panel/User Accounts/Change User Account Control settings and move the slider down.I found an easy way to run Visual Studio as administrator. I did it in windows 10 but I believe it would work on any windows.
