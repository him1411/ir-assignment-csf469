This question already has an answer here:I am trying to optimize a function which does binary search of strings in Javascript.Binary search requires you to know whether the key is == the pivot or < the pivot.But this requires two string comparisons in Javascript, unlike in C like languages which have the strcmp() function that returns three values (-1, 0, +1) for (less than, equal, greater than).Is there such a native function in Javascript, that can return a ternary value so that just one comparison is required in each iteration of the binary search?You can use the localeCompare() method. Further Reading:Well in JavaScript you can check two strings for values same as integers so yo can do this:And therefore you can make your own function that checks strings the same way as the strcmp().So this would be the function that does the same:You can use the comparison operators to compare strings. A strcmp function could be defined like this:Edit\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here\xe2\x80\x99s a string comparison function that takes at most min { length(a), length(b) } comparisons to tell how two strings relate to each other:
