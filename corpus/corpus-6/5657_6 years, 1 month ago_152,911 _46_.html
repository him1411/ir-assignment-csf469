I have a login-screen in my iOS app.\nThe username and password will be saved in the NSUserDefaults and be loaded into the login-screen again when you enter the app again (of course, NSUserDefaults are permanent).Now, the user have the possibility to disable the username/password saving feature.So the NSUserDefaults will be cleared then.But In my app I need this username/password for database queries for the user.\nSo: Where to store the data except NSUserDefaults? \n(This place can / should be deleted when the user quit the app or logout).You should always use Keychain to store usernames and passwords, and since it\'s stored securely and only accessible to your app, there is no need to delete it when app quits (if that was your concern).Apple provides sample code that stores, reads and deletes keychain items and here is how to use the keychain wrapper class from that sample which greatly simplifies using Keychain.Include Security.framework (in Xcode 3 right-click on frameworks folder and add existing framework. In Xcode 4 select your project, then select target, go to Build Phases tab and click + under Link Binary With Files) and KeychainItemWrapper .h & .m files into your project, #import the .h file wherever you need to use keychain and then create an instance of this class:(YourAppLogin can be anything you chose to call your Keychain item and you can have multiple items if required)Then you can set the username and password using:Get them using:Or delete them using:If you need an ARC version of the wrapper here is the link https://gist.github.com/1170641 \nThanks to A very easy solution via Keychains.It\'s a simple wrapper for the system Keychain. Just add the SSKeychain.h, SSKeychain.m, SSKeychainQuery.h and SSKeychainQuery.m files to your project and add the Security.framework to your target.To save a password:To retrieve a password:Where setPassword is what value you want saved and forService is what variable you want it saved under and account is for what user/object the password and any other info is for.You can simply use NSURLCredential, it will save both username and password in the keychain in just two lines of code.See my detailed answer.If you are having an issue retrieving the password using the keychain wrapper, use this code:I decided to answer how to use keychain in iOS 8 using Obj-C and ARC.1)I used the keychainItemWrapper (ARCifief version) from GIST:\nhttps://gist.github.com/dhoerl/1170641/download\n- Add (+copy) the KeychainItemWrapper.h and .m to your project2) Add the Security framework to your project (check in project > Build phases > Link binary with Libraries)3) Add the security library (#import ) and KeychainItemWrapper (#import "KeychainItemWrapper.h") to the .h and .m file where you want to use keychain.4) To save data to keychain:5) Read data (probably login screen on loading > viewDidLoad):Enjoy!checkout this sample code\ni tried first the apple\'s wrapper from the sample code but this is much simpler for metry this one:may it will help.I looked at using KeychainItemWrapper (the ARC version) but I didn\'t find its Objective C wrapper as wholesome as desired.I used this solution by Kishikawa Katsumi, which meant I wrote less code and didn\'t have to use casts to store NSString values.Two examples of storing:Two examples of retrievingThere is a small bug in the above code (by the way Dave it was very helpful your post thank you) In the part where we save the credentials it also needs the following code in order to work properly. most probably is because the second time we try to (re-)sign in with the same credentials it finds them already assigned in the keychain items and the app crashes. with the above code it works like a charm. To update this question:For those using Swift checkout this drag and drop swift implementation by Mihai Costea supporting access groups: https://github.com/macostea/KeychainItemWrapper.swift/blob/master/KeychainItemWrapper.swiftBefore using the keychain:\nconsider twice before storing passwords. In many cases storing an authentication token (such as a persistence session id) and the email or account name might be enough. You can easily invalidate authentication tokens to block unauthorized access, requiring the user to login again on the compromised device but not requiring reset password and having to login again on all devices (we are not only using Apple are we?).The following should work just fine:But, now you can go for NURLCredential instead of keychain wrapper. It does what we need to do.For swift you can use this library:https://github.com/jrendel/SwiftKeychainWrapperIt supports all versions of swift.
