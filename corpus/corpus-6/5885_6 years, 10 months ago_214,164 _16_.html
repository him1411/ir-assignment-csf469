How do you delete an ActiveRecord object?I looked at Active Record Querying and it does not have anything on deleting that I can see.Delete by id,Delete the current object like: user.remove,Can you delete based on a where clause?It\'s destroy and destroy_all methods, likeAlternatively you can use delete and delete_all which won\'t enforce :before_destroy and :after_destroy callbacks or any dependent association options.User.delete_all(condition: \'value\') will allow you to delete records\n  without a primary keyThere is delete, delete_all, destroy, and destroy_all.  The docs are: older docs and Rails 3.0.0 docsdelete doesn\'t instantiate the objects, while destroy does.  In general, delete is faster than destroy.User.destroy(1) will delete user with id == 1 and :before_destroy and :after_destroy callbacks occur. For example if you have associated records After user is destroyed his addresses will be destroyed too.\nIf you use delete action instead, callbacks will not occur.User.destroy, User.deleteUser.destroy_all(<conditions>) or User.delete_all(<conditions>)Notice: User is a class and user is an instance object
