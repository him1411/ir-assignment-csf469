I can\'t figure this out. Some apps have a EditText (textbox) which, when you touch it and it brings up the on-screen keyboard, the keyboard has a "Search" button instead of an enter key.I want to implement this. How can I implement that Search button and detect press of the Search button?Edit: found how to implement the Search button; in XML, android:imeOptions="actionSearch" or in Java, EditTextSample.setImeOptions(EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_SEARCH);. But how do I handle the user pressing that Search button? Does it have something to do with android:imeActionId?In the layout set your input method options to search.In the java add the editor action listener.Hide keyboard when user clicks search. Addition to Robby Pond answerIn XML,put imeOptions:actionSearch and inputType:"text",maxLines:"1"
