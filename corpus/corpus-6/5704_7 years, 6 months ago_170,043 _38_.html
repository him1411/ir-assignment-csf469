The instanceof keyword in JavaScript can be quite confusing when it is first encountered, as people tend to think that JavaScript is not an object-oriented programming language.The Left Hand Side (LHS) operand is the actual object being tested to the Right Hand Side (RHS) operand which is the actual constructor of a class. The basic definition is:Here are some good examples and here is an example taken directly from Mozilla\'s developer site:One thing worth mentioning is instanceof evaluates to true if the object inherits from the classe\'s prototype:That is p instanceof Person is true since p inherits from Person.prototype.I\'ve added a small example with some sample code and an explanation.  When you declare a variable you give it a specific type.  For instance:The above show you some variables, namely i, f, and c. The types are integer, float and a user defined Customer data type. Types such as the above could be for any language, not just JavaScript.  However, with JavaScript when you declare a variable you don\'t explicitly define a type, var x, x could be a number / string / a user defined data type. So what instanceof does is it checks the object to see if it is of the type specified so from above taking the Customer object we could do:Above we\'ve seen that c was declared with the type Customer. We\'ve new\'d it and checked whether it is of type Customer or not. Sure is, it returns true. Then still using the Customer object we check if it is a String. Nope, definitely not a String we newed a Customer object not a String object. In this case, it returns false.It really is that simple!There\'s an important facet to instanceof that does not seem to be covered in any of the comments thus far: inheritance.  A variable being evaluated by use of instanceof could return true for multiple "types" due to prototypal inheritance.For example, let\'s define a type and a subtype:Now that we have a couple of "classes" lets make some instances, and find out what they\'re instances of:See that last line?  All "new" calls to a function return an object that inherits from Object.  This holds true even when using object creation shorthand:And what about the "class" definitions themselves?  What are they instances of?I feel that understanding that any object can be an instance of MULTIPLE types is important, since you my (incorrectly) assume that you could differentiate between, say and object and a function by use of instanceof.  As this last example clearly shows a function is an object.This is also important if you are using any inheritance patterns and want to confirm the progeny of an object by methods other than duck-typing.  Hope that helps anyone exploring instanceof.The other answers here are correct, but they don\'t get into how instanceof actually works, which may be of interest to some language lawyers out there.Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, accessible through the __proto__ property. Functions also have a prototype property, which is the initial __proto__ for any objects created by them. When a function is created, it is given a unique object for prototype. The instanceof operator uses this uniqueness to give you an answer. Here\'s what instanceof might look like if you wrote it as a function.This is basically paraphrasing ECMA-262 edition 5.1 (also known as ES5), section 15.3.5.3. Note that you can reassign any object to a function\'s prototype property, and you can reassign an object\'s __proto__ property after it is constructed. This will give you some interesting results:I think it\'s worth noting that instanceof is defined by the use of the "new" keyword when declaring the object. In the example from JonH;What he didn\'t mention is this;Specifying "new" actually copied the end state of the String constructor function into the color1 var, rather than just setting it to the return value. I think this better shows what the new keyword does;Using "new" assigns the value of "this" inside the function to the declared var, while not using it assigns the return value instead.And you can use it for error handling and debugging, like this:On the question "When is it appropriate and when not?", my 2 cents:instanceof is rarely useful in production code, but useful in tests where you want to assert that your code returns / creates objects of the correct types. By being explicit about the kinds of objects your code is returning / creating, your tests become more powerful as a tool for understanding and documenting your code.I just found a real-world application and will use it more often now, I think.If you use jQuery events, sometimes you want to write a more generic function which may also be called directly (without event). You can use instanceof to check if the first parameter of your function is an instance of jQuery.Event and react appropriately.In my case, the function needed to calculate something either for all (via click event on a button) or only one specific element. The code I used:instanceof is just syntactic sugar for isPrototypeOf:instanceof just depends on the prototype of a constructor of an object.A constructor is just a normal function. Strictly speaking it is a function object, since everything is an object in Javascript. And this function object has a prototype, because every function has a prototype.A prototype is just a normal object, which is located within the prototype chain of another object. That means being in the prototype chain of another object makes an object to a prototype:The instanceof operator should be avoided because it fakes classes, which do not exist in Javascript. Despite the class keyword not in ES2015 either, since class is again just syntactic sugar for...but that\'s another story.
