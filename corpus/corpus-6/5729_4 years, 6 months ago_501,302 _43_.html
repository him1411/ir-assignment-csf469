Suppose I have the following snippet:I\'d expect this snippet to show:42 - Slim Shady - EminemBut instead it shows:42 +   -   + Slim Shady +   -   + EminemWhich makes me think the + operator isn\'t appropriate for concatenating strings and variables.How should you approach this with PowerShell?See the Windows PowerShell Language Specification Version 3.0, p34, sub-expressions expansion.One way is:Another one is:Or just (but I don\'t like it ;) ):No one seems to have mentioned the difference between single and double quotes.\n(I am using PowerShell 4).You can do this (as @Ben said):Or you can do this: The single quotes are for literal, output the string exactly like this, please.\nThe double quotes are for when you want some pre-processing done (such as variables, special characters etc)So:Whereas:(http://ss64.com/ps/syntax-esc.html I find good for reference).Try wrapping whatever you want to print out in parenthesis:Your code is being interpreted as many parameters being passed to Write-Host. Wrapping it up inside parenthesis will concatenate the values and then pass the resulting value as a single parameter.To concatenate two strings to store in a variable/use in a function, you can use -join.E.g.Would assign "John" to $name.So to output, in one line:Another option is:The "best" method is probably the one C.B. suggested:You need to place the expression in parentheses to stop them being treated as different parameters to the cmdlet:Here is another way as an alternative:I just want to bring another way to do this using .NET String.Format:From What To Do / Not to Do in PowerShell: Part 1:These answers all seem very complicated. If you are using this in a PowerShell script you can simply do this:It will outputMy name is Slim ShadyNote how a space is put between the words for youConcatenate strings just like in the DOS days. This is a big deal for logging so here you go:I seem to struggle with this (and many other unintuitive things) every time I use PowerShell after time away from it, so I now opt for:Write-Host can concatenate like this too: This is the simplest way, IMHO.While expression:will concatenate the strings.  You need to put a $ in front of the parenthesis to make it evaluate as a single argument when passed to a powershell command.  Example:As a bonus, if you want it to span multiple lines, then you need to use the ackward backtick syntax at the end of the line (without any spaces or characters to the right of the backtick).  Example:(Actually, I think Powershell is currently implemented a little bit wrong by requires unnecessary back-ticks between parenthesis.  If Microsoft would just follow "Python" or "TCL" Parenthesis rules of allowing you to put as many newlines as you want between starting and ending parenthesis then they would solve most of the problems that people don\'t like about powershell related to  line continuation, and concatenation of strings.  I\'ve found that you can leave the back-ticks off sometimes on line continuations between parenthesis, but its really flakey and unpredicatable if it will work.. its better to just add the backticks.)Try this:
