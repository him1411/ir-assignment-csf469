This question already has an answer here:Given a number:Which would be the "best" way to convert this to a string:\nI have tried searching (googling) for an answer but no many seemed "trustworthy".\nThere are multiple ways:Integer class has static method toString() - you can use it:Returns a String object representing the specified integer. The argument is converted to signed decimal representation and returned as a string, exactly as if the argument and radix 10 were given as arguments to the toString(int, int) method.This will do. Pretty trustworthy. : )Always use either String.valueOf(number) or Integer.toString(number).Using "" + number is an overhead and does the following:The way I know how to convert an integer into a string is by using the following code:and If you had an integer i, and a string s, then the following would apply:If you wanted to convert a string "s" into an integer "i", then the following would work:This is the method which i used to convert the integer to string.Correct me if i did wrong.One that I use often:Point is, there are plenty of ways to do this, all equally valid. As to which is most optimum/efficient, you\'d have to ask someone else.
