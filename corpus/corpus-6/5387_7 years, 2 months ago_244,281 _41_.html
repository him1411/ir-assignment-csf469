I think the answer is no, but can you position a background image with CSS, so that it is a fixed amount of pixels away from the right?If I set background-position values of x and y, it seems those only give fixed pixel adjustments from the left and top respectively.It works in most browsers. See: http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-background-offsets for full list.More information: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-background-positionIt is possible to use attribute border as length from the rightThere is one way but it\'s not supported on every browser (see coverage here)It works in every modern browser, but it is possible that IE9 is crashing. Also no coverage for =< IE8.As far as I know, the CSS specification does not provide for exactly what you\'re asking, outside of CSS expressions, of course. Working off the assumption that you don\'t want to use expressions or Javascript, I see three hackish solutions:Try this:Note though that the code above will move the whole element (not the background image only) 5px from the right. This might be ok for your case.You can do it in CSS3:It works in Firefox, Chrome, IE9+Source: MDNImage workaround with transparent pixels on the right to serve as right margin.The image workaround for the same is to create a PNG or GIF image (image file formats that support transparency) which has a transparent portion on the right of the image exactly equal to the number of pixels that you want to give a right margin of (eg: 5px, 10px, etc.)This works well consistently across fixed widths as well as widths in percentages.\nPractically a good solution for accordion headers having a plus/minus or up/down arrow image on the header\'s right!Downside: Unfortunately, you cannot use JPG unless the background portion of the container and the background color of the CSS background image are of the same flat color (with out a gradient/vignette), mostly white/black etc.If you happen to stumble on this topic in these days of modern browsers you can use pseudo-class :after to do practicaly anything with the background.this css will put background to bottom right corner of ".container" element with 20px space on the right side.See this fiddle for example http://jsfiddle.net/h6K9z/226/The most appropriate answer is the new four-value syntax for background-position, but until all browsers support it your best approach is a combination of earlier responses in the following order:Just put the pixel padding into the image - add 10px or whatever to the canvas size of the image in photohop and align it right in CSS.I was trying to do a similar task to get a dropdown arrow always on the right side of the table header and came up with this which seemed to work in Chrome and Firefox, but safari was telling me it was an invalid property. After doing a bit of messing around in the inspector, I came up with this cross-browser solution that works in IE8+, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, as well as responsive designs. Here is a codepen of how it looks and works. Codepen is written with SCSS - http://cdpn.io/xqGbkAnother solution I haven\'t seen mentioned is to use pseudo elements and I do believe this solution will work with any CSS 2.1 compliant browser (\xe2\x89\xa5 IE8,\xe2\x89\xa5 Safari 2, ...) and it should also be responsive :Example: The element eg. a square sized 100px (without considering borders) has a 10px padding and a background image should be shown inside the right padding. This means the pseudo-element is a 80px sized square. We want to stick it to the right border of the element with right:-10px;. If we\'d like to have the background-image 5px away from the right border we need to stick the pseudo-element 5px away from the right border of the element with right:-5px;...\nTest it for your self here : http://jsfiddle.net/yHucT/If the container has a fixed height:\nTweek the percentages (background-position) until it fits correctly.If the container has a dynamic height:\nIf you want a padding between your background and your container (such as when custom styling inputs, selects), add your padding to your image and set the background position to right or bottom. I stumbled on this question while I was trying to get the background for a select box to fit say 5 px from the right of my select. In my case, my background is an arrow down that would replace the basic drop down icon. In my case, the padding will always remain the same (5-10 pixels from the right) for the background, so it\'s an easy modification to bring to the actual background image (making its dimensions 5-10 pixels wider on the right side.Hope this helps!You can position your background image in an editor to be x pixels from the right side.The background image will be positioned in top right, but will appear to be x pixels from the right.Tweaking percentages from the left is a little brittle for my liking. When I need something like this I tend to add my container styling to a wrapper element and then apply the background on the inner element with background-position: right bottomThe .content-breakout class is optional and will allow your content to eat into the padding if required (negative margin values should match the corresponding values in the wrapper padding). It\'s a little verbose, but works reliably without having to be concerned about the relative positioning of the image compared to its width and height.Its been loong since this question has been asked, but I just ran into this problem and I got it by doing :Solution for negative values. Adjust the padding-right to move the image.This works in Chrome 27, i don\'t know if it\'s valid or not or what other browswers do with it. I was surprised about this.Works for all real browsers (and for IE9+):I use it to RTL WordPress themes.\nSee example: temporary website or the real website will be up soon.\nLook at the icons at the big DIVs right corners.Better for all\nbackground: url(\'../images/bg-menu-dropdown-top.png\') left 20px top no-repeat !important;
