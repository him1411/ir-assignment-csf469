I\'ve just generated my RSA keypair and I want to add that key to Github.I tried cd id_rsa.pub and id_rsa.pub but no luck. How can I access my SSH public key?cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pubYou can list all the public keys you have by doing:$ ls ~/.ssh/*.pubCopy the key to your clipboard.Warning: it\'s important to copy the key exactly without adding\n  newlines or whitespace. Thankfully the pbcopy command makes it easy to\n  perform this setup perfectly.and you can paste it where ever you need.To get a better idea of the whole process, check this :\nGenerating SSH Keys.if you\'re on windows use this & select all > copy from notepad windowif you\'re on osx You may try to run the following command to show your RSA fingerprint:or public key:If you\'ve the message: \'The agent has no identities.\', then you\'ve to generate your RSA key by ssh-keygen first.Here\'s How I found mine on OSXif that doesn\'t work, do an ls and see what files are in there with a .pub extensionif your .ssh folder does not have any id_rsa.pub file, you can create it with the ssh-keygen command After you generate your SSH key you can do:which will copy your ssh key into your clipboard.Open your id_dsa.pub or some_name.pub file with gedit and copy-paste the contents!Just use:PS:\nI too am new to git.If you are using Windows Powershell, the easiest way is to:That will copy the key to your clipboard for easy pasting.So, in my instance, I use ed25519 since rsa is now fairly hackable:Because I find myself doing this a lot, I created a function and set a simple alias I could remember in my PowerShell profile (learn more about powershell profiles here. Just add this to your Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1:Then, in a Powershell console, run . $profile to load the functions, then from now on all you will need to do is run sshkey, and then paste the key into wherever you need via the clipboardThen copy the entire file without any spaces.\nClick your icon at top right of Github page goto settings and add ssh.\nPaste the copy into the space.
