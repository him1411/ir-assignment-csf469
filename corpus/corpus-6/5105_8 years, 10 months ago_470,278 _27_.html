Can someone post a simple example of starting two (Object Oriented) threads in C++. I\'m looking for actual C++ thread objects that I can extend run methods on (or something similar) as opposed to calling a C-style thread library.Thanks.Update - I left out any OS specific requests in the hopes that whoever replied would reply with cross platform libraries to use. I\'m just making that explicit now.Create a function that you want the thread to execute. I\'ll demonstrate with a trivial example:Now create the thread object that will ultimately invoke the function above like so:(You need to #include <thread> to access the std::thread class)As you can see, the constructor\'s arguments are the function the thread will execute, followed by the function\'s parameters.Finally, join it to your main thread of execution like so:(Joining means that the thread who invoked the new thread will wait for the new thread to finish execution, before it will continue its own execution).More information about std::thread hereWell, technically any such object will wind up being built over a C-style thread library because C++ only just specified a stock std::thread model in c++0x, which was just nailed down and hasn\'t yet been implemented. The problem is somewhat systemic, technically the existing c++ memory model isn\'t strict enough to allow for well defined semantics for all of the \'happens before\' cases. Hans Boehm wrote an paper on the topic a while back and was instrumental in hammering out the c++0x standard on the topic.http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2004/HPL-2004-209.htmlThat said there are several cross-platform thread C++ libraries that work just fine in practice. Intel thread building blocks contains a tbb::thread object that closely approximates the c++0x standard and Boost has a boost::thread library that does the same.http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_37_0/doc/html/thread.htmlUsing boost::thread you\'d get something like:There is also a POSIX library for POSIX operating systems. \nCheck for compatability compile with -lpthreadhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_ThreadsIt largely depends on the library you decide to use. For instance, if you use the wxWidgets library, the creation of a thread would look like this:If your main thread calls the CreateThread method, you\'ll create a new thread that will start executing the code in your "Entry" method. You\'ll have to keep a reference to the thread in most cases to join or stop it.\nMore info here: wxThread documentationHere is a more robust way of creating arbitrary number of threads (in C++11 or newer):When searching for an example of a C++ class that calls one of its own instance methods in a new thread, this question comes up, but we were not able to use any of these answers that way. Here\'s an example that does that:Class.hClass.cppNote that this example doesn\'t get into mutex or locking.
