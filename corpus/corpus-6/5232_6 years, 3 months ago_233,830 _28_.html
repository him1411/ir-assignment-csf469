Suppose you have some style and the markup:When you view this. The <ul> has a scroll bar at the bottom even though I\'ve specified visible and hidden values for overflow x/y.(observed on Chrome 11 and opera (?))I\'m guessing there must be some w3c spec or something telling this to happen but for the life of me I can\'t work out why. JSFiddleUPDATE:- I found a way to acheive the same result by adding another element wrapped around the ul. Check it out.After some serious searching it seems i\'ve found the answer to my question:from: http://www.brunildo.org/test/Overflowxy2.htmlIn Gecko, Safari, Opera, \xe2\x80\x98visible\xe2\x80\x99\n  becomes \xe2\x80\x98auto\xe2\x80\x99 also when combined with\n  \xe2\x80\x98hidden\xe2\x80\x99 (in other words: \xe2\x80\x98visible\xe2\x80\x99\n  becomes \xe2\x80\x98auto\xe2\x80\x99 when combined with\n  anything else different from\n  \xe2\x80\x98visible\xe2\x80\x99). Gecko 1.8, Safari 3, Opera\n  9.5 are pretty consistent among them.also the W3C spec says:The computed values of \xe2\x80\x98overflow-x\xe2\x80\x99\n  and \xe2\x80\x98overflow-y\xe2\x80\x99 are the same as their\n  specified values, except that some\n  combinations with \xe2\x80\x98visible\xe2\x80\x99 are not\n  possible: if one is specified as\n  \xe2\x80\x98visible\xe2\x80\x99 and the other is \xe2\x80\x98scroll\xe2\x80\x99 or\n  \xe2\x80\x98auto\xe2\x80\x99, then \xe2\x80\x98visible\xe2\x80\x99 is set to\n  \xe2\x80\x98auto\xe2\x80\x99. The computed value of\n  \xe2\x80\x98overflow\xe2\x80\x99 is equal to the computed\n  value of \xe2\x80\x98overflow-x\xe2\x80\x99 if \xe2\x80\x98overflow-y\xe2\x80\x99\n  is the same; otherwise it is the pair\n  of computed values of \xe2\x80\x98overflow-x\xe2\x80\x99 and\n  \xe2\x80\x98overflow-y\xe2\x80\x99.Short Version:If you are using visible for either overflow-x or overflow-y and something other than visible for the other, the visible value is interpreted as auto.I originally found a CSS way to bypass this when using the Cycle jQuery plugin. Cycle uses JavaScript to set my slide to overflow: hidden, so when setting my pictures to width: 100% the pictures would look vertically cut, and so I forced them to be visible with !important and to avoid showing the slide animation out of the box I set overflow: hidden to the container div of the slide. Hope it works for you.UPDATE - New Solution:Original problem -> http://jsfiddle.net/xMddf/1/\n(Even if I use overflow-y: visible it becomes "auto" and actually "scroll".)The new solution -> http://jsfiddle.net/xMddf/2/\n(I found a workaround using a wrapper div to apply overflow-x and overflow-y to different DOM elements as James Khoury advised on the problem of combining visible and hidden to a single DOM element.)another cheap hack, which seems to do the trick:style="padding-bottom: 250px; margin-bottom: -250px;" on the element where the vertical overflow is getting cutoff, with 250 representing as many pixels as you need for your dropdown, etc.I used the content+wrapper approach ... but I did something different than mentioned so far: I made sure that my wrapper\'s boundaries did NOT line up with the content\'s boundaries in the direction that I wanted to be visible.Important NOTE: It was easy enough to get the content+wrapper, same-bounds approach to work on one browser or another depending on various css combinations of position, overflow-*, etc ... but I never could use that approach to get them all correct (Edge, Chrome, Safari, ...).But when I had something like:... all browsers were happy.I\'ve run into this issue when trying to build a fixed positioned sidebar with both vertically scrollable content and nested absolute positioned children to be displayed outside sidebar boundaries.My approach consisted of separately apply:Please check the example below or an online codepen.
