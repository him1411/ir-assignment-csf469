I made a basic rails app with a simple pages controller with an index function and when I load the page I get:GemfileBy default Rails assumes that you have your files precompiled in the production environment, if you want use live compiling (compile your assets during runtime) in production you must set the config.assets.compile to true.You can use this option to fallback to Sprockets when you are using precompiled assets but there are any missing precompiled files.If config.assets.compile option is set to false and there are missing precompiled files you will get an "AssetNoPrecompiledError" indicating the name of the missing file.You will get better performance in production if you set config.assets.compile to false in production.rb and precompile your assets.  You can precompile with this rake task:If you are using Capistrano, version 2.8.0 has a recipe to handle this at deploy time.  For more info, see the "In Production" section of the Asset Pipeline Guide: \nhttp://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.htmlOK - I had the same problem.  I didn\'t want to use "config.assets.compile = true" - I had to add all of my .css files to the list in config/environments/production.rb:Then I had to create (and later delete) tmp/restart.txtI consistently used the stylesheet_link_tag helper, so I found all the extra css files I needed to add with:A quick fix for capistrano user is to put this line to CapfileFor all those who are reading this but do not have problem with application.css and instead with their custom CSS classes e.g. admin.css, base.css etc.Solution is to use as mentionedAnd in stylesheets references just reference application.cssSince assets pipeline will precompile all of your stylesheets in application.css. This also happens in development so using any other references is wrong when using assets pipeline.I was having the exact same error in my development environment. In the end all I needed to do in order to fix it was to add:to my config/environments/development.rb file and it fixed it. My final config in development related to assets looks like:I also had this issue, where trying to run in production without precompiling it would still throw not-precompiled errors. I had to change which line was commented application.rb:Here\'s the quick fix:If you\'re using capistrano do this add this to your deploy.rb:cap deployI ran into this error message today and wanted to post the resolution to my particular my case.  It turns out that my problem was that one of my css files was missing a closing brace and this was causing the file to not be compiled.  It may be harder to notice this if you have an automated process that sets everything up (including the asset precompile) for your production environment.After all else failed...My solution was to change the layout file fromtoAnd it worked! (You can put the reset file inside the manifest.)Just another way to fix this up on Heroku: Make sure your Rakefile is committed and pushed.On heroku server (readonly filesystem), \nIf you want runtime compilation of css (its not recommended but you can do it), make sure you have done settings like below - if you think you followed everything good but still unlucky, just make sure you/capistrano run touch tmp/restart.txt or equivalent at the end. I was in the unlucky list but now :) You probably have a syntax error in the css you are using.Run this commandIt will give the exception, fixed that and you are all done.Thanks
