I have two divs inside another div, and I want to position one child div to the top right of the parent div, and the other child div to the bottom of the parent div using css. Ie, I want to use absolute positioning with the two child divs, but position them relative to the parent div rather than the page. How can I do this? Sample html:This works because position: absolute means something like "use top, right, bottom, left to position yourself in relation to the nearest ancestor who has position: absolute or position: relative."So we make #father have position: relative, and the children have position: absolute, then use top and bottom to position the children.If you don\'t give any position to parent then by default it takes static. If you want to understand that difference refer to this exampleExample 1::http://jsfiddle.net/Cr9KB/1/Here parent class has no position so element is placed according to body.Example 2::http://jsfiddle.net/Cr9KB/2/In this example parent has relative position hence element are positioned absolute inside relative parent.Incase someone wants to postion a child div directly under a parentWorking demo Codepen
