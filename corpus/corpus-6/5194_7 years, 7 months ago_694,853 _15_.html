I have an Array (var cars = []) which holds a few integers.\nI\'ve added a few values to the array, but I now need to send this array to a page via jQuery\'s .get method. How can I convert it to a JSON object for sending?Script for backward-compatibility: \nhttps://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.jsAnd call:Note: The JSON object is now part of most modern web browsers (IE 8 & above). See caniuse for full listing. Credit goes to: @Spudley for his comment belowI made it that way:if I have:to convert pluginArrayArg (which is pure javascript array) into JSON array:Or try defining the array as an object.

Not only it works now but also I have included only the fields I need. Here is how I did it:Wow, seems it got a lot easier nowadays... 3 ways you can do it:displays: BlockquoteObject {-Ka-w4mXxC38_F1tatXC: true, -Ka-wGz2eseuUt1D8lQf: true}a demo of fibonacci:
