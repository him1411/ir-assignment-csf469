Let\'s say my sample url ishttp://example.com/one/twoand I say I have the following routeThe value of url will be /one/two.How do I get the full url in Express? \nFor example, in the case above, I would like to receive http://example.com/one/two.The protocol is available as req.protocol. docs hereThe host comes from req.get(\'host\') as Gopal has indicatedHopefully you don\'t need a non-standard port in your URLs, but if you did need to know it you\'d have it in your application state because it\'s whatever you passed to app.listen at server startup time. However, in the case of local development on a non-standard port, Chrome seems to include the port in the host header so req.get(\'host\') returns localhost:3000, for example. So at least for the cases of a production site on a standard port and browsing directly to your express app (without reverse proxy), the host header seems to do the right thing regarding the port in the URL.The path comes from req.originalUrl (thanks @pgrassant). Note this DOES include the query string. docs here on req.url and req.originalUrl. Depending on what you intend to do with the URL, originalUrl may or may not be the correct value as compared to req.url.Combine those all together to reconstruct the absolute URL.Instead of concatenating the things together on your own, you could instead use the node.js API for URLs and pass URL.format() the informations from express.Example:I found it a bit of a PITA to get the requested url. I can\'t believe there\'s not an easier way in express. Should just be req.requested_urlBut here\'s how I set it:Using url.format:This support all protocols and include port number. If you don\'t have a query string in your originalUrl you can use this cleaner solution:If you have a query string:Here is a great way to add a function you can call on the req object to get the urlNow you have a function you can call on demand if you need it.You need to construct it using req.headers.host + req.url.  Of course if you are hosting in a different port and such you get the idea ;-)Use this,var url = req.headers.host + \'/\' + req.url;I would suggest using originalUrl instead of URL:See the description of originalUrl here:\nhttp://expressjs.com/api.html#req.originalUrlIn our system, we do something like this, so originalUrl is important to us:blah_controller looks like this:So our URLs have the format:Hence, we need req.originalUrl in the bar controller get handler.make req.host/req.hostname effective must have two condition when Express behind proxies:nginx:apache:My code looks like this, params[\'host_url\'] = req.protocol + \'://\' + req.headers.host + req.url;I use the node package \'url\' (npm install url)What it does is when you call it will give you the possibility to retrieve all or parts of the url. More info here: https://github.com/defunctzombie/node-urlI used it in the following way to get whatever comes after the / in http://www.example.com/ to use as a variable and pull up a particular profile (kind of like facebook: http://www.facebook.com/username)Though for this to work, you have to create your route this way in your server.js file:And set your route file this way:I actually discovered that by using this code below you can get your url. Then proceed to slicing it up and deciding what next.or
