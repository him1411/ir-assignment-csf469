I am working with images, and I ran across a problem with aspect ratios.As you can see, height and width are already specified. I added CSS rule for images:But for big_image.jpg, I receive width=500 and height=600. How I can set images to be re-sized, while keeping their aspect ratios.This will make image shrink if it\'s too big for specified area (as downside, it will not enlarge image).The solutions below will allow scaling up and scaling down of the image, depending on the parent box width.All images have a parent container with a fixed width for demonstration purposes only. In production this will be the width of the parent box.This solution tells the browser to render the image with max available width and adjust the height as a percentage of that width.For the line specifying padding, you need to calculate the aspect ratio of the image, for example:So, top padding = 34.37%.With the fancier solution you\'ll be able to crop the image regardless of it\'s size and add a background color to compensate for the cropping.The background-size property is ie>=9 only, but if that is fine with you, you can use a div with background-image and set background-size: contain:Now you can just set your div size to whatever you want and not only will the image keep its aspect ratio it will also be centralized both vertically and horizontally within the div. Just don\'t forget to set the sizes on the css since divs don\'t have the width/height attribute on the tag itself.This approach is different than setecs answer, using this the image area will be constant and defined by you (leaving empty spaces either horizontally or vertically depending on the div size and image aspect ratio), while setecs answer will get you a box that exactly the size of the scaled image (without empty spaces).Edit:\nAccording to the MDN background-size documentation you can simulate the background-size property in IE8 using a proprietary filter declaration:Though Internet Explorer 8 doesn\'t support the background-size property, it is possible to emulate some of its functionality using the non-standard -ms-filter function:I\'ve struggled with this problem quite hard, and eventually arrived at this simple solution:You can adjust the width and height to fit your needs, and the object-fit property will do the cropping for you.Cheers.Remove the "height" property.By specifying both you are changing the aspect ratio of the image. Just setting one will resize but preserve the aspect ratio.Optionally, to restrict oversizings:Just add this to your css, It will automaticly shrink and expand with keeping the original ratio.AFAIK, there is no standard way to preserve aspect ratio for images with width, height and max-width specified together.So we are forced either to specify width and height to prevent page \xe2\x80\x9cjumps\xe2\x80\x9d during loading images, or to use max-width and not specify dimensions for images.Specifying just width (without height) typically makes not much sense, but you can try to override height HTML-attribute by adding a rule like IMG {height: auto; } into your stylesheet.See also related Firefox bug 392261.https://jsfiddle.net/sot2qgj6/3/Here is the answer if you want to put image with fixed percentage of width, but not fixed pixel of width.And this will be useful when dealing with different size of screen.The tricks areI\'ve also comment most of the tricks inside the fiddle.I also find some other ways to make this happen.\nThere will be no real image in html, so I personly perfer the top answer when I need "img" element in html.simple css by using background\njsfiddle.net/4660s79h/2/background-image with word on top\njsfiddle.net/4660s79h/1/the concept to use position absolute is from here\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_aspect_ratio.asp*I need at least 10 reputation to post more than 2 links... therefore I have to do something stupid. Sorry about that.Set the CSS class of your image container tag to image-class:and add this you your CSS stylesheet.You can create a div like this:And use this css to style it:To maintain a responsive image while still enforcing the image to have a certain aspect ratio you can do the following:HTML:And SCSS:This can be used to enforce a certain aspect ratio, regardless of the size of the image that authors upload.Thanks to @Kseso at  http://codepen.io/Kseso/pen/bfdhg. Check this URL for more ratios and a working example.You can use this:To force image that fit in a exact size, you don\'t need to write too many codes. It\'s so simple This will make image shrink if it\'s too big for specified area (as downside, it will not enlarge image).The solution by setec is fine for "Shrink to Fit" in auto mode. \nBut, to optimally EXPAND to fit in \'auto\' mode, you need to first put the received image into a temp id, \nCheck if it can be expanded in height or in width (depending upon its aspect ration v/s the aspect ratio of your display block),  This approach is useful when received images are smaller than display box. You must save them on your server in Original Small size rather than their expanded version to fill your Bigger display Box to save on size and bandwidth.How about using a pseudo element for vertical alignment? This less code is for a carousel but i guess it works on every fixed size container. It will keep the aspect ratio and insert @gray-dark bars on top/bottom or left/write for the shortest dimension. In the meanwhile the image is centered horizontally by the text-align and vertically by the pseudo element.Very similar to some answers here, but in my case I had images that  sometimes were taller, sometimes larger. This style worked like a charm to make sure that all images use all available space, keep the ratio and not cuts:
