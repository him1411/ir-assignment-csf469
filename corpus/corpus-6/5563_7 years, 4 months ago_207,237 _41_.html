I know the obvious answer is to use virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper, but for various reasons I can\'t/don\'t want to do that.So how do I modify the commandto make pip install the package somewhere other than the default site-packages?Use:You might also want to use --ignore-installed to force all dependencies to be reinstalled using this new prefix.  You can use --install-option to multiple times to add any of the options you can use with python setup.py install (--prefix is probably what you want, but there are a bunch more options you could use).The --target switch is the thing you\'re looking for:pip install --target=d:\\somewhere\\other\\than\\the\\default package_nameBut you still need to add d:\\somewhere\\other\\than\\the\\default to PYTHONPATH to actually use them from that location.Upgrade pip if target switch is not available:On Linux or OS X:On Windows (this works around an issue):Installing a Python package often only includes some pure Python files. If the package includes data, scripts and or executables, these are installed in different directories from the pure Python files.Assuming your package has no data/scripts/executables, and that you want  your Python files to go into /python/packages/package_name (and not some subdirectory a few levels below /python/packages as when using --prefix), you can use the one time command:If you want all (or most) of your packages to go there, you can edit your ~/.pip/pip.conf to include:That way you can\'t forget about having to specify it again and again.Any excecutables/data/scripts included in the package will still go to their default places unless you specify addition install options (--prefix/--install-data/--install-scripts, etc., for details look at the custom installation options).Instead of the --target option or the --install-options option, I have found that the following works well (from discussion on a bug regarding this very thing at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/446):(Or set the PYTHONUSERBASE directory in your environment before running the command, using export PYTHONUSERBASE=/path/to/install/to)This uses the very useful --user option but tells it to make the bin, lib, share and other directories you\'d expect under a custom prefix rather than $HOME/.local.Then you can add this to your PATH, PYTHONPATH and other variables as you would a normal installation directory.Note that you may also need to specify the --upgrade and --ignore-installed options if any packages upon which this depends require newer versions to be installed in the PYTHONUSERBASE directory, to override the system-provided versions.A full example:..to install the scipy and numpy package most recent versions into a directory which you can then include in your PYTHONPATH like so (using bash and for python 2.6 on CentOS 6 for this example):Using virtualenv is still a better and neater solution!Just add one point to @Ian Bicking\'s answer:Using the --user option to specify the installed directory also work if one wants to install some Python package into one\'s home directory (without sudo user right) on remote server.E.g., The command will install the package into one of the directories that listed in your PYTHONPATH.To pip install a library exactly where I wanted it, I navigated to the location I wanted the directory with the terminal then usedthe logic of which I took from this page: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/googlecloudstorageclient/downloadNewer versions of pip (8 or later) can directly use the --prefix option:where $PREFIX_PATH is the installation prefix where lib, bin and other top-level folders are placed.With pip v1.5.6 on Python v2.7.3 (GNU/Linux), option --root allows to specify a global installation prefix, (apparently) irrespective of specific package\'s options. Try f.i.,To add to the already good advice, as I had an issue installing IPython when I didn\'t have write permissions to /usr/local.pip uses distutils to do its install and this thread discusses how that can cause a problem as it relies on the sys.prefix setting.My issue happened when the IPython install tried to write to \'/usr/local/share/man/man1\' with Permission denied. As the install failed it didn\'t seem to write the IPython files in the bin directory.Using "--user" worked and the files were written to ~/.local. Adding ~/.local/bin to the $PATH meant I could use "ipython" from there.However I\'m trying to install this for a number of users and had been given write permission to the /usr/local/lib/python2.7 directory. I created a "bin" directory under there and set directives for distutils:then (-I is used to force the install despite previous failures/.local install):Then I added /usr/local/lib/python2.7/bin to $PATH.I thought I\'d include this in case anyone else has similar issues on a machine they don\'t have sudo access to.
