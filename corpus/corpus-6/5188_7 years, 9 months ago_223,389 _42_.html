I\'m looking for a simple way to parse JSON, extract a value and write it into a database in Rails.Specifically what I\'m looking for, is a way to extract shortUrl from the JSON returned from the bit.ly API: And then take that shortUrl and write it into an ActiveRecord object associated with the long URL.This is one of those things that I can think through entirely in concept and when I sit down to execute I realize I\'ve got a lot to learn. These answers are a bit dated. Therefore I give you:Rails should automagically load the json module for you, so you don\'t need  to add require \'json\'.Parsing JSON in Rails is quite straightforward:Let\'s suppose, the object you want to associate the shortUrl with is a Site object, which has two attributes - short_url and long_url. Than, to get the shortUrl and associate it with  the appropriate Site object, you can do something like:This answer is quite old. pguardiario\'s got it.One site to check out is JSON implementation for Ruby. This site offers a gem you can install for a much faster C extension variant.With the benchmarks given their documentation page they claim that it is 21.500x faster than ActiveSupport::JSON.decodeThe code would be the same as Milan Novota\'s answer with this gem, but the parsing would just be:Here is an update for 2013.Ruby 1.9 has a default JSON gem with C extensions. You can use it withThe parse! variant can be used for safe sources. There are also other gems, which may be faster than the default implementation. Please refer to multi_json for the list.Modern versions of Rails use multi_json, a gem that automatically uses the fastest JSON gem available. Thus, the recommended way is to usePlease refer to ActiveSupport::JSON for more information. In particular, the important line in the method source isThen in your Gemfile, include the gems you want to use. For example,Ruby\'s bundled JSON is capable of exhibiting a bit of magic on its own. If you have a string containing JSON serialized data that you want to parse:JSON will look at the parameter, see it\'s a String and try decoding it.Similarly, if you have a hash or array you want serialized, use:Or:And JSON will serialize it. You can also use the to_json method if you want to avoid the visual similarity of the [] method. Here are some examples:If you root around in JSON you might notice it\'s a subset of YAML, and, actually the YAML parser is what\'s handling JSON. You can do this too:If your app is parsing both YAML and JSON, you can let YAML handle both flavors of serialized data.This will return a Hashwork with the hash and do what you want to do.The Oj gem (https://github.com/ohler55/oj) should work. It\'s simple and fast.http://www.ohler.com/oj/#Simple_JSON_Writing_and_Parsing_ExampleThe Oj gem won\'t work for JRuby. For JRuby this (https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json) or this (https://github.com/clojure/data.json) may be good options.RUBY is case sensitive.for example Ruby has a JSON parser:Here\'s what I would do:If you know the source url then you can use:If you don\'t know the key for the source url you can do the following:If you\'re not wanting to lookup keys using symbols, you can convert the keys in the hash to strings:If you\'re concerned the JSON structure might change you could build a simple JSON Schema and validate the JSON before attempting to access keys. This would provide a guard.NOTE: Had to mangle the bit.ly url because of posting rules.You can try something like this:
