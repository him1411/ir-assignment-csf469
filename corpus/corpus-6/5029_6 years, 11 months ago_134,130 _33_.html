I ended up with a detached head today, the same problem as described in: git push says everything up-to-date even though I have local changesAs far as I know I didn\'t do anything out of the ordinary, just commits and pushes from my local repo.  So how did I end up with a detached HEAD?Any checkout of a commit that is not the name of one of your branches will get you a detached HEAD. A SHA1 which represents the tip of a branch would still gives a detached HEAD. Only a checkout of a local branch name avoids that mode.See committing with a detached HEADWhen HEAD is detached, commits work like normal, except no named branch gets updated. (You can think of this as an anonymous branch.)For example, if you checkout a "remote branch" without tracking it first, you can end up with a detached HEAD.See git: switch branch without detaching headI reproduced this just now by accident:lists the remote branchesI want to checkout one locally, so I cut paste:Presto! Detached HEAD stateSolution #1:Do not include origin/ at the front of my branch spec when checking it out: Solution #2:Add -b parameter which creates a local branch from the remotegit checkout -b origin/Feature/f1234  orgit checkout -b Feature/f1234 it will fall back to origin automatically It can easily happen if you try to undo changes you\'ve made by re-checking-out files and not quite getting the syntax right.You can look at the output of git log - you could paste the tail of the log here since the last successful commit, and we could all see what you did.  Or you could paste-bin it and ask nicely in #git on freenode IRC.try this gives you a history of how your HEAD and branch pointers\nwhere moved in the past.e.g. :88ea06b HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from DEVELOPMENT to remotes/origin/SomeNiceFeature\ne47bf80 HEAD@{1}: pull origin DEVELOPMENT: Fast-forwardthe top of this list is one reasone one might encounter a DETACHED HEAD\nstate ... checking out a remote tracking branch.The other way to get in a git detached head state is to try to commit to a remote branch.  Something like:Note that if you do this, any further attempt to checkout origin/foo will drop you back into a detached head state!The solution is to create your own local foo branch that tracks origin/foo, then optionally push.This probably has nothing to do with your original problem, but this page is high on the google hits for "git detached head" and this scenario is severely under-documented.A simple accidental way is to do a git checkout head as a typo of HEAD.Try this:which gives
