I need to search a string and replace all occurrences of %FirstName% and %PolicyAmount% with a value pulled from a database. The problem is the capitalization of FirstName varies. That prevents me from using the String.Replace() method. I\'ve seen web pages on the subject that suggestHowever for some reason when I try and replace %PolicyAmount% with $0, the replacement never takes place. I assume that it has something to do with the dollar sign being a reserved character in regex. Is there another method I can use that doesn\'t involve sanitizing the input to deal with regex special characters?From MSDN\n$0 - "Substitutes the last substring matched by group number number (decimal)."In .NET Regular expressions group 0 is always the entire match. For a literal $ you need toSeems like string.Replace should have an overload that takes a StringComparison argument. Since it doesn\'t, you could try something like this:Here\'s an extension method. Not sure where I found it.Seems the easiest method is simply to use the Replace method that ships with .Net and has been around since .Net 1.0:In order to use this method, you have to add a Reference to the Microsoft.VisualBasic assemblly.  This assembly is a standard part of the .Net runtime, it is not an extra download or marked as obsolete.Kind of a confusing group of answers, in part because the title of the question is actually much larger than the specific question being asked. After reading through, I\'m not sure any answer is a few edits away from assimilating all the good stuff here, so I figured I\'d try to sum.Here\'s an extension method that I think avoids the pitfalls mentioned here and provides the most broadly applicable solution.So...Unfortunately, @HA \'s comment that you have to Escape all three isn\'t correct. The initial value and newValue doesn\'t need to be.Note: You do, however, have to escape $s in the new value that you\'re inserting if they\'re part of what would appear to be a "captured value" marker. Thus the three dollar signs in the Regex.Replace inside the Regex.Replace [sic]. Without that, something like this breaks..."This is HIS fork, hIs spoon, hissssssss knife.".ReplaceCaseInsensitiveFind("his", @"he$0r")Here\'s the error:Tell you what, I know folks that are comfortable with Regex feel like their use avoids errors, but I\'m often still partial to byte sniffing strings (but only after having read Spolsky on encodings) to be absolutely sure you\'re getting what you intended for important use cases. Reminds me of Crockford on "insecure regular expressions" a little. Too often we write regexps that allow what we want (if we\'re lucky), but unintentionally allow more in (eg, Is $10 really a valid "capture value" string in my newValue regexp, above?) because we weren\'t thoughtful enough. Both methods have value, and both encourage different types of unintentional errors. It\'s often easy to underestimate complexity.That weird $ escaping (and that Regex.Escape didn\'t escape captured value patterns like $0 as I would have expected in replacement values) drove me mad for a while. Programming Is Hard (c) 1842Inspired by cfeduke\'s answer, I made this function which uses IndexOf to find the old value in the string and then replaces it with the new value. I used this in an SSIS script processing millions of rows, and the regex-method was way slower than this.Expanding on C. Dragon 76\'s popular answer by making his code into an extension that overloads the default Replace method.Based on Jeff Reddy\'s answer, with some optimisations and validations:a version similar to C. Dragon\'s, but for if you only need a single replacement:Here is another option for executing Regex replacements, since not many people seem to notice the matches contain the location within the string:The regular expression method should work.  However what you can also do is lower case the string from the database, lower case the %variables% you have, and then locate the positions and lengths in the lower cased string from the database.  Remember, positions in a string don\'t change just because its lower cased.Then using a loop that goes in reverse (its easier, if you do not you will have to keep a running count of where later points move to) remove from your non-lower cased string from the database the %variables% by their position and length and insert the replacement values.
