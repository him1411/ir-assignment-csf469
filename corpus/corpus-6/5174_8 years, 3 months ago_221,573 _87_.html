I am getting this strange error in Eclipse while trying to set a breakpoint.I ticked the checkbox from Compiler options but no luck.I had the same error message in Eclipse 3.4.1, SUN JVM1.6.0_07 connected to Tomcat 6.0 (running in debug-mode on a different machine, Sun JVM1.6.0_16, the debug connection did work correctly).Window --> Preferences --> Java --> Compiler --> Classfile Generation: "add line number attributes to generated class file" was checked. I did a clean, recompile. I did uncheck it, recompile, check it, recompile. I made sure the project did use the global settings. Still the same message.I switched to ant build, usingStill, same message.I didn\'t find out what caused this message and why it wouldn\'t go away. Though it seemed to have something to do with the running Tomcat debug session: when disconnected, recompiling solves the issue. But on connecting the debugger to Tomcat or on setting new breakpoints during a connected debug session, it appeared again.However, it turned out the message was wrong: I was indeed able to debug and set breakpoints, both before and during debugging (javap -l did show line numbers, too). So just ignore it :)trailThis fixed my issue:I have the answer to this problem from the BlackBerry SDK side of things: For some reason, no matter how many times I changed the options in the compiler, the actual underlying settings file did not change.Have a look in the .settings folder of your project for a file called org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs.In there you can modify the settings manually:edit: Further to this, I have noticed that sometimes I can ignore the alert Eclipse gives, and it will still stop at the required place... curioser and curioser... I put this into the bucket of things we learn to deal with when working as dev.For Spring related issues consider that in some cases it generate classes "without line numbers"; for example a @Service annotated class without an interface, add the interface and you can debug. see here for a complete example.The service above will have an interface generated by spring causing "missing line numbers". Adding a real interface solve the generation problem:This worked for me:Dont know if this is still relevant, perhaps another sailor will find this useful. The message appears when one has a class file compiled the debug flags turned off. In eclipse, you can turn it on by the afore mentioned options, Window --> Preferences --> Java --> Compiler --> Classfile Generation: "add line number attributes to generated class file"But if you have a jar file, then you would get the compiled output. There is no easy way to fix this problem. If you have access to the source and use ant to get the jar file, you may modify the ant task as follows.Happy debugging.. ref: \nhttp://doc.sumy.ua/prog/Java/javanut/ch16_04.htm It would help if you did indicate the version of eclipse you are using and the technology (Java JDT, or AJDT for Aspect Java, or C++ CDT for instance), just to be sure.On the Java side, I suppose your "Ticked the checkbox from Compiler options" refers to this Under  "Window --> Preferences --> Java --> Compiler --> Classfile Generation", all \'Class file\' generation options are set to True: Does your project has those checked only at global level (widows Preferences) or at project specific level ?And are you sure the class opened (on which you try to set a breakpoint):Try to clean everything and rebuild all, check for potential jar conflicts.I had this problem while attempting to start Tomcat in debugging mode from Eclipse. I had an ANT build file taking care of the compile and deploy. After setting the debug flag to true (as mentioned in other answers) and redeploying the application it worked fine:NOTE: if you\'ve just added the debug flag and recompiled you still need to redeploy your application to the server since this is where Eclipse is debugging the class files. Very obvious but easy to spend an hour or so scratching your head and wondering why it\'s not working (trust me).My situation was similar:This breakpoint generates the error in question, every time I run Debug As... > JUnit TestTo address the problem, I moved the Breakpoint \'up\' into the actual test (inside TaskTest.java).  Once execution stopped, I added the breakpoint back where I had it, originally (inside Task.java).I still got the same error but after clicking "ok," the breakpoint worked just fine.Hope that helps someone,-gmaleI had same problem when i making on jetty server and compiling new .war file by ANT. You should make same version of jdk/jre compiler and build path (for example jdk 1.6v33, jdk 1.7, ....) after you have to set Java Compiler as was written before. I did everything and still not working. The solution was delete the compiled .class files and target of generated war file and now its working:) try to change the jre you use.Set the jre in the folder of JDK instead.Got this message with Spring AOP (seems to be coming from the CGLIB library). Clicking Ignore seems to work fine, I can still debug.I found yet another reason for this message. I was programming Scala. The solution was: Now the debugging should work. Notice that I have installed the Scala IDE plugin, this option may not be available if you don\'t have it. Since I have 6 different versions of Java installed, I had to change my default JDK compliance to match that of the Java version I wanted to use. Eclipse by default had compiler compliance level set to Java 1.7 when everything was built/compiled using Java 1.6.So all I did was Now Eclipse doesn\'t complain about the "Unable to insert breakpoint Absent Line Number Information" anymore and the debugging breakpoints actually work!!!I had this same problem when debugging a WAR (constructed from multiple Eclipse project artifacts) deployed to Tomcat.I am building everything using an ANT build script. If this is what you are doing, make sure that the debug=true flag is set on every javac ant task you\'ve got. This was my only problem - I hope it helps your problem!I had the same error with JBoss 7.1..\nAnd I did the same as Zefiro. Just ignored the error and i was able to place breakpoints normally.\nIn my case i was building thought ant builder and this is my javac task:Once I experienced the same error when I used junit and Mockito, I forgot to add @PrepareForTest for a static class. Add below code fixed my problem.Not sure it was the same case.I did all of what is listed above while compiling/building the jars - still had the same issue.Eventually, the jvmarg changes listed below while starting the server is what finally worked for me:1) Removed/Commented a bunch of jvm args pertaining to javaagent and bootclasspath.2) Turned on/un-commented the following line:\n  Then when I start the server, I am able to hit my breakpoints. I suspect that the javaagent was somehow interfering with Eclipse\'s ability to detect line numbers.Check/do the following:1) Under "Window --> Preferences --> Java --> Compiler --> Classfile Generation", all options have to be to True:2) In .settings folder of your project, look for a file called org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs.\nVerify or set org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.debug.lineNumber=generate3) If error window still appears, click the checkbox to not display the error message.4) Clean and build the project. Start debugging.Normally the error window is not displayed any more and the debugging informations is displayed correctly. I ran into this problem as well. I am using an ant build script. I am working on a legacy application so I am using jdk version 1.4.2. This used to work so I started looking around. I noticed that under the Debug configuration on the JRE tab the version of Java had been set to 1.7. Once I changed it back to 1.4 it worked.I hope this helps.I was trying to debug the logging manager and needed to change the jre to a jdk and then to select this jdk in the "main" tab, "Java Runtime Environment" | "runtime JRE" of the debug configuration then all was well.I saw this problem when I annotated a class with @ManagedBean (javax.annotation.ManagedBean). The warning message came up when running the newly complied app on JBoss EAP 6.2.0. Ignoring it and running anyway did not help - the breakpoint was never reached.I was calling that bean using EL in a JSF page. Now... it\'s possible that @ManagedBean is no good for that (I\'m new to CDI). When I changed my annotation to @Model, my bean executed but the breakpoint warning also went away and I hit the breakpoint as expected.In summary it certainly looked as though the @ManagedBean annotation messed up the lines numbers, regardless of whether or not it was the wrong annotation to use.I got the same issue, I spent a lot of time to look for solution but these solutions are unuseful, So I self study all of cases, finally I found out problem it is confliction among JDK versions. \nBelow is steps to resolve problem:\n1. Remove all of JDK and JRE version, keep only one version.\n2. Set JAVA_HOME system and java compiler in Eclipse is the same.\nIn some cases, the error above will not disappear, but we be able to run at debug model.Make sure the project in which the main class of the runtime is, is the same project in which is the class you have breakpoints in. If not, make sure both projects are in the classpath of the run configuration, and appear before any jars and class folders.I had the same issue with one specific project and I kept trying to reset the line number attributes in Window->Preferences... Then I realized each project has it\'s own settings for line number attributes. Right click the project, go into properties, choose JavaCompiler, and check the box to "Add line number attributes..."If above solution doesn\'t work and you started to get that problem after you did a spring bean injection, problem can be that you didnt use interface for injected class. Try to do injection with class which implements an interface would solve the problem. For an example follow the link:\nUnable to install breakpoint problem for bean creation I tried almost every solution here and no luck.  Did you try clicking "Don\'t tell me again"?  After doing so I restarted my program and all was well.  Eclipse hit my breakpoint as if nothing was wrong.The root cause for me was Eclipse was trying to setup debugging for auto-generated Spring CGLIB proxy objects.  Unless you need to debug something at that level you should ignore the issue.This is explained in detail here:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ide/issues/78Just for future reference, this is the relevant part of the answer (ignore the fact that refers to a Spring Boot application, behavior is the same for lot of other cases):Whenever you set a breakpoint in Eclipse/STS, the IDE tries to set the breakpoint in the VM if you launch an app. That is what happens in your case when you run the boot app in debug mode.For each class that gets loaded into the JVM, the IDE checks whether it needs to set a breakpoint or not. If it decides to set the breakpoint, the tries to do so (using the information from the breakpoint definition in the IDE, including its line number, since you usually set line breakpoints on a source file at a given line).This decision (whether to set the breakpoint on a given loaded class or not) checks the types that you set the breakpoint on, enclosing types, and inner classes. This makes sure that breakpoints for inner classes (even anonymous inner classes) are set to the JVM (and are not ignored).Spring Boot generates an inner class for your controller at runtime (this is the CGLIB generated inner class that appears in the error message). When the JVM loads that class, it tries to set the line number breakpoint of the enclosing type (for this inner class). Since the generated inner class doesn\'t have any line number information (it doesn\'t need to have line number information), setting the breakpoint fails for this inner class with the mentioned error message.When the IDE loads the enclosing type (your controller class itself), it also tries to set the line breakpoint and succeeds with that. This is visualized with the check marker on the breakpoint marker.Therefore you can safely ignore the error message that shows up. To avoid this error message to show up, you can go to the preferences (Java -> Debug) and disable "Warn when unable to install breakpoint due to missing line number attributes".We also have this message when starting the Java EE project with the Spring Tool Suite (STS), but we are in the good position just to ignore this message, as everything works fine.
