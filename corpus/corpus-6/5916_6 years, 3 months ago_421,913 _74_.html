I included:all Spring libs,Apache Tomcat 7.0 libraryin Build Path but it still gives errors:In "org.sprintframework.web-3.1.0.M1.jar", I can see "org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener".Someone on Google says that spring.jar should be included but I don\'t see any spring.jar in 3.x distribution.Eclipse 3.6.2\nTomcat 7Edit: Someone says "Automatically update dependencies" should be checked in Project Properties but I don\'t see anything like that in project properties.\nClassNotFoundException:org.springframework.web.con text.ContextLoaderListenerI had a similar problem when running a spring web application in an Eclipse managed tomcat. I solved this problem by adding maven dependencies in the project\'s web deployment assembly. You should see "Maven Dependencies" added to the Web Deployment Assembly definition.Same thing happens to me from time to time when using Eclipse WDT. Its specialy frustrating when this happens to a unmodified and previously working project. This is what I do to fix it in this last scenario:This usually fixes the issue you mention.You could try "Clean Tomcat Work Directory" or simply "Clean..". This supposed to discard all published state and republish from scratch. I used IntelliJ IDEA, compilation is successful, but when starting Tomcat, it says:In the beginning, I thought the JAR was missing, but it was in place.Solution:\nFile > Project Structure > Artifacts, in the Output Layout double click in right panel Available Elements the library named like Maven:..., it will be moved to WEB-INF/lib in the left pane.Accept and restart Tomcat.This is surely Eclipse related issue.\nThe thing which worked for me is creating a new server in eclipse server tab.\nThen run your application in this new server, it should work.You have to use at least version 3.2.8.RELEASE of spring-core. For Maven, set in your pom.xml:Source: http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cglib/core/SpringNamingPolicy.html, since 3.2.8.If you\'re using maven, perhaps the project aint built yet. First do a \'mvn clean package\' then try redeploying again.I was facing the same issue for a eclipse project configured for Tomcat 7 runtimeRight click on project and go to project properties.\nClick on Deployment Assembly. I could notice that my spring library jars which I created during compile time with a user library was missing.\nJust add the jars and you should see no errors in console during tomcat start upIf everything mentioned above does not work try the following. It worked for me. Remove your project from the server > Restart server > Add your project to server > Restart server. Detailed Instruction:Solution for Eclipse Luna:Actually this is a problem of Tomcat.\nJust go to \'lib\' folder of your project and copy your all \'Spring\' related jars into this. Refresh your project and you are all good to go.\nThis problem sometime persists because tomcat is unable to locate Spring core classes.I tried theThe only thing that worked at least temporarily was to add Maven Dependencies to Web Deployment Assembly definitionBut this does not work for ever! After a couple of days it stops working. My solution was to remove Maven Dependencies, apply change and add Maven Dependencies again.I\'m using\n- eclipse Juno\n- embedded maven\n- tomcat 7For gradle users, It works with following steps1) Stop and Delete tomcat server from Servers Tab in eclipse2) clean webapp and work directory from tomcat installation , (Reference, How-To: Clear out Tomcat\xe2\x80\x99s cache and fix outdated JSP problems)3) clean and eclipsify project using build tool$ ./gradlew clean eclipse //fire respective command for mvn users, $ mvn clean package4) configure a new Tomcat server in eclipse, and run the project again.i too faced the same problem.... and resolved by following the below steps:RC(right click on web project)  --> properties  --> Deployment Assembly -->  Add --> Java Build Path Entries --> Next --> select jar files which are missing --> next --> finishApplication is running successfully...I have the same issue , and I have resolved it using the steps mentioned above.but no when I have this issue again and  i try the following,RC(right click on web project) --> properties --> Deployment Assembly --> Add --> Java Build Path Entries --> Next --> after clicking on next its only a blank window with the options Next and Fnish disabled.What can I do now?I faced the same problem.Just removed the server from configuration and added it back after restarting eclipse by adding it to the server runtime environment.For me the fix was to right click on my webapp module > Maven > Update ProjectOne quick solution I prefer which I suited most for this situation is simply delete .metadata folder of your work space and import your projects again. If you try all other option it wont guarantee the success. Sometimes the above solutions work sometime you will spend your precious hours to fix this configuration.One day i decided to clean my work station.I arranged the projects to their suitable folders according to different clients. As a result all got messed up. After spending a whole day it did not end up in a fixed work space. Next day I simply deleted the .metadata folder of the work space and imported all the projects again. Bingo all set.Put <packaging>war</packaging> in your pom.xml if you are using Maven.\nIn that case, maybe it is with jar packagingYou must have Maven libs in Deployment AssemblyUsing the "Update project configuartion" messed up the build path of the project. Fix: Open the "configure build path..." menu (right click on the project) and fix the Included/Excluded options for each source folder.\nThat worked for me.In many case It is java facet problem ,jdk or jre or jsp  version is difference than maven project face.The actual solution for me was to install the "m2e-wtp - Maven integration for WTP". The solution of Marcelo is not neccessary in that case.if nothing from above works, remove the .class  from the listener class  i.e.I also had the same error. I had not added the below dependency in my POM file.       But My porject used to run even before I had added this dependency. But at one point it stopped and started giving the same above error.If any one couldn\'t solve this error they can also solve by this linkThis works for me ..Right Click on maven web project\nClick \'Properties\'menu\nSelect \'Deployment Assembly\' in left side of the popped window\nClick \'Add...\' Button in right side of the popped up window\nNow appear one more popup window(New Assembly Directivies)\nClick \'Java Build path entries\'\nClick \'Next\' Button\nClick \'Finish\' Button, now atomatically close New Assemby Directivies popup window\nNow click \'Apply\' Button and Ok Button\nRun your webapplicationThis happened to me after I made changes to my Hibernate mapping in an IntelliJ project using Gradle. Simply rebuilding the project worked for me.I ran into this a couple times a quarter.  This time I had a minimal change summary in my git diff and tracked the problem to a reset classpath (missing my WEB-INF/lib dependency) in eclipse.  This seems to occur any time I pull in or pull out parent/sibling maven projects.There are mentions of adding your spring jars to the tomcat web container lib - this is ok and is the way most EE servers run.  However be aware that by placing spring higher in the classloader tree on tomcat you will be running higher than the classloader level of your war context.  I recommend you leave the libs in a per/war lower level classloader.We see the following after a truncated .classpath after a structural project change in eclipse.My classpath was reset and the WEB-INF/lib dependency was removed.put back and you will be OK.thank you\n/michaelI got this when I had the lib in my build path, but not in my deployment assembly. Also when I had a missing context.xml.I had the same issue. I resolved it by adding spring-web dependency in my pom.\n Make sure you use spring-web jar which has ContextLoaderListener class extends ContextLoader implements ServletContextListener and reside in the package org.springframework.web.context. I used 3.0.4.RELEASE
