What is the difference between tinyint, smallint, mediumint, bigint and int in MySQL?In what cases should these be used?They take up different amounts of space and they have different ranges of acceptable values.Here are the sizes and ranges of values for SQL Server, other RDBMSes have similar documentation:Turns out they all use the same specification (with a few minor exceptions noted below) but support various combinations of those types (Oracle not included because it has just a NUMBER datatype, see the above link):And they support the same value ranges (with one exception below) and all have the same storage requirements:The "unsigned" types are only available in MySQL, and the rest just use the signed ranges, with one notable exception: tinyint in SQL Server is unsigned and has a value range of 0 to 255the size of storage required and how big the numbers can beon SQL Servertinyint  1 byte, 0 to 255smallint 2 bytes, 2^15 (-32,768) to 2^15-1 (32,767)int 4 bytes, -2^31 (-2,147,483,648) to 2^31-1 (2,147,483,647)bigint 8 bytes, -2^63 (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808) to 2^63-1 (9,223,372,036,854,775,807)you can store the number 1 in all 4, but a bigint will use 8 bytes while a tinyint will use 1 byteThose seem to be MySQL data types.According to the documentation they take:And, naturally, accept increasingly larger ranges of numbers.When it gets to real world usage of these datatypes, it is very important that you understand that using certain integer types could just be an overkill or under used. For example, using integer datatype for employeeCount in a table say employee could be an overkill since it supports a range of integer values from ~ negative 2 billion to positive 2 billion or zero to approximately 4 billion (unsigned). So, even if you consider one of the US biggest employer such as Walmart with roughly about 2.2 million employees using an integer datatype for the employeeCount column would be unnecessary. In such a case you use mediumint (that supports from 0 to 16 million (unsigned)) for example. Having said that if your range is expected to be unusually large you might consider bigint which as you can see from Daniel\'s notes supports a range larger than I care to decipher.The difference is the amount of memory allocated to each integer, and how large a number they each can store.Data type   Range   StorageExampleThe following example creates a table using the bigint, int, smallint, and tinyint data types. Values are inserted into each column and returned in the SELECT statement.
