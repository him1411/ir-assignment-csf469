I\'m trying to set a WPF image\'s source in code. The image is embedded as a resource in the project. By looking at examples I\'ve come up with the below code. For some reason it doesn\'t work - the image does not show up. By debugging I can see that the stream contains the image data. So what\'s wrong?The icon is defined something like this: <Image x:Name="_icon" Width="16" Height="16" />After having the same problem as you and doing some reading, I discovered the solution - Pack URIs.I did the following in code:The URI is broken out into parts:Path: The name of a resource file that is compiled into a referenced assembly. The path must conform to the following format: AssemblyShortName[;Version][;PublicKey];component/PathThe three slashes after application: have to be replaced with commas:Note: The authority component of a pack URI\n  is an embedded URI that points to a\n  package and must conform to RFC 2396.\n  Additionally, the "/" character must\n  be replaced with the "," character,\n  and reserved characters such as "%"\n  and "?" must be escaped. See the OPC\n  for details.And of course, make sure you set the build action on your image to Resource.This will load a image called "Untitled.png" in a folder called "Images" with its "Build Action" set to "Resource" in an assembly called "WpfApplication1".This is a bit less code and can be done in a single line.Very easy: To set a menu item\'s image dynamically, only do the following:...whereas "icon.ico" can be located everywhere (currently it\'s located in the \'Resources\' directory) and must be linked as Resource...You can also reduce this to one line.  This is the code I used to set the Icon for my main window.  It assumes the .ico file is marked as Content and is being copied to the output directory.Have you tried:simplest way:have fun :)This\'s my wayuseage:Here is an example that sets the image path dynamically (image located somewhere on disc rather than build as resource):First thought, you would think that the Icon property can only contain an image. But it can actually contain anything! I discovered this by accident when I programmatically tried to set the Image property directly to a string with the path to an image. The result was that it did not show the image, but the actual text of the path!This leads to an alternative to not have to make an image for the icon, but use text with a symbol font instead to display a simple "icon". The following example uses the Wingdings font which contains a "floppydisk" symbol. This symbol is really the charachter <, which has special meaning in XAML, so we have to use the encoded version &lt; instead. This works like a dream! The following shows a floppydisk symbol as an icon on the menu item: There\'s also a simpler way, if the image is loaded as resource in the xaml, and the code in question is the codebehind for that xamlRegards\nBharat ThankiPut the Frame in a VisualBrush:Put the VisualBrush in GeometryDrawing Now put the GeometryDrawing in a DrawingImage:Place this on your Source of Image, et voila!You could do it a lot easier though:And in code:BitmapImage image = new BitmapImage { UriSource="/yourassembly;component/YourImage.PNG" };HTHThere\'s also a simpler way, if the image is loaded as resource in the xaml, and the code in question is the codebehind for that xamlHere\'s the resource dictionary for a XAML file - the only line you case about is the ImageBrush with the key "PosterBrush" - the rest of the code is just to show contextNow, in the code behind, you can just do thisHow to Load an Image from Embedded in Resource Icons and Images (corrected version of Arcturus)Suppose you want to add button with image. What should you do? \n1. Add to project folder Icons and put here image ClickMe.png\n2. In properties of \'ClickMe.png\' set \'BuildAction\' to \'Resource\'\n3. Suppose you compiled assembly name is \'Company.ProductAssembly.dll\'\n4. Now its time to load our image in Xaml\nDONEI am a new to WPF, but not in .NET.\nI have spent 5 hours trying to add a png file to a "WPF Custom Control Libyrary Project" in .NET 3.5 (Visual Studio 2010) and setting it as a background of an Image-inherited control.Nothing relative with URIs worked. I can not imagine why there is no method to get a URI from a resource file, thoug IntelliSense, maybe as:I\'ve tryied a lot of URIs and played with ResourceManager, and Assembly\'s GetManifest methods, but allthere where exceptions or NULL values.Here I pot the code that worked for me:If your image is stored in a ResourceDictionary, you can do it with only one line of code : If you already have a stream and know the format, you can use something like this:you just missed a little bit.to get embedded resource from any assembly, you have to mention the assembly name with you file name as I have mentioned here.
