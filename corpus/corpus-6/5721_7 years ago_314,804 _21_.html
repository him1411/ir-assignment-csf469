I have created the meat and guts of my application but I want to add a different activity that will be the starting point (sort of a log-in screen).Couple questions:1 I have a fairly decent handle on how to switch between activities (based on this article: http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7498) but I\'m not sure how to go about creating a new one (with eclipse).2 Once I have a new activity created, how can I set it as the default activity of my application?  I presume I could just change the name of the classes...but is there a more elegant way to handle that (maybe within the AndroidManifest.xml)?Yes, you use the AndroidManifest.xml file. You can actually even have more than one launcher activity specified in your application manifest. To make an activity seen on the launcher you add these attributes to your activity in the manifest:Go to AndroidManifest.xml in the root folder of your project and change the Activity name which you want to execute first. Example: If you are using Android Studio you might have previously selected another Activity to launch. Click on "Run" and "Edit configuration". Then make sure to have Launch default activity selected. This is easy to fix. Changes to the Launcher activity are also stored in the Debug configuration. Go to "Run" \n"Debug Configurations" and edit the setting.  There is also a similar setting in Intellij under "Run" "Edit-Configurations" select "Run default Activity" and it will no longer save the setting in this fashion.DerekIts simple.Doin your android manifest file.Follow to below instructions:1:) Open your AndroidManifest.xml file.2:) Go to the activity code which you want to make your main activity like below.such as i want to make SplashScreen as main activity 3:) Now copy the below code in between activity tags same as:and also check that newly added lines are not attached with other activity tags.Just go to your AndroidManifest.xml file and add like below then save and run your android project.
