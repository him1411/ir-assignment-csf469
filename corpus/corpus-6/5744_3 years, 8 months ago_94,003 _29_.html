I have downloaded, and successfully ran the ASP.NET Identity sample from here:\nhttps://github.com/rustd/AspnetIdentitySampleI am now in the middle of implementing the ASP.NET Identity framework in my project and have ran into a problem, that has driven me mad all day...GetOwinContext() does not exist as an extension method on my HttpContextI am implementing the identity framework in class library. I have installed all the latest (pre-release version) of the Identity framework and everything - apart from this - is working fine.I have tried implementing the same code as the same direct in my controller, and find the same problem.I\'m clearly missing a reference somewhere, though I have no idea what..!..The code-block that is killing me is:I have added references to the following - tried these both in my class library and also direct on the controller, none of them work for me...... this is driving me up the wall....any idea?UPDATEI have checked the versions of Identity & OWIN in the sample, and I have made sure I have the same versions in my solution.More so, if I search the object browser on the sample for GetOwinContext I can find the method, however when I search for it in my solution it is nowhere to be found... I must have some library out of date, but I can\'t find it!ARGH! I found it... I didn\'t have an extra package, called Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWebOnce i searched and installed this, it worked.Now - i am not sure if i just missed everything, though found NO reference to such a library or package when going through various tutorials. It also didn\'t get installed when i installed all this Identity framework... Not sure if it were just me..EDIT\nAlthough it\'s in the Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb assembly it is an extension method in the System.Web namespace, so you need to have the reference to the former, and be using the latter.I believe you need to reference the current HttpContext if you are outside of the controller.  The MVC controllers have a base reference to the current context.  However, outside of that, you have to explicitly declare you want the current HttpContextAs for it not showing up, a new MVC 5 project template using the code you show above (the IAuthenticationManager) has the following using statements at the top of the account controller:Commenting out each one, it appears the GetOwinContext() is actually a part of the System.Web.Mvc assembly. After trial and error comparing the using statements of my controller and the Asp.Net Template controllerSolved the problem for me.\nYou also going to need to add:To use GetUserManager method.Microsoft couldn\'t find a way to resolve this automatically with right click and resolve like other missing using statements?in my case adding Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Owin refference via nuget did a trick.Make sure you installed the nuget package Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Owin. Then add System.Net.Http namespace.I had all the correct packages and usings, but had to built first before I could get GetOwinContext() to work.To get UserManager in APIwhere AppUserManager is the class that inherits from UserManager.
