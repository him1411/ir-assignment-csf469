How can I get the last day of the month in PHP?Given:I want 2009-11-30; and givenI want 2009-12-31.t returns the number of days in the month of a given date (see the docs for date):The code using strtotime() will fail after year 2038. (as given in the first answer in this thread)\nFor example try using the following:It will give answer as: 1970-01-31So instead of strtotime, DateTime function should be used. \nFollowing code will work without Year 2038 problem: I know this is a little bit late but i think there is a more elegant way of doing this with PHP 5.3+ by using the DateTime class : There is also the built in PHP function cal_days_in_month()?"This function will return the number of days in the month of year for the specified calendar."\n  http://php.net/manual/en/function.cal-days-in-month.This should work:You could create a date for the first of the next month, and then use strtotime("-1 day", $firstOfNextMonth)Your solution is here..If you use the Carbon API extension for PHP DateTime, you can get the last day of the month with:Try this , if you are using PHP 5.3+,For finding next month last date, modify as follows,and so on..You can also use it with datetimeWhat is wrong with you guys? \nThe most elegant is using DateTimeI wonder I do not see DateTime::createFromFormat, one linerYou can find last day of the month several ways. But simply you can do this using PHP strtotime() and date() function.I\'d imagine your final code would look something like this:Live DemoBut If you are using PHP >= 5.2 I strongly suggest you use the new DateTime object. For example like below:Live DemoAlso, you can solve this using your own function like below:Here is a complete function:This would output following:Output: 28There are ways to get last day of month.Using Zend_Date it\'s pretty easy:Carbon API extension for PHP DateTimeorwill retrunhttp://zkinformer.com/?p=134I have wrapped it in my date time helper class here \nhttps://github.com/normandqq/Date-Time-Helper\nusing \n    $dateLastDay = Model_DTHpr::getLastDayOfTheMonth();And it is doneAn other way using mktime and not date(\'t\') :So this way it calculates either if it is 31,30 or 29 I am late but there are a handful of easy ways to do this as mentioned:Using mktime() is my go to for complete control over all aspects of time...\nI.E.Setting the day to 0 and moving your month up 1 will give you the last day of the previous month. 0 and negative numbers have the similar affect in the different arguements.\nPHP: mktime - ManualAs a few have said strtotime isn\'t the most solid way to go and little if none are as easily versatile.This a much more elegant way to get the end of the month:You can use "t" in date function to get the number of day in a particular month.The code will be something like this:The code is self-explained. So hope it helps.
