I\'ve got the following error when launching my Angular 2.0 app, even if the component is not displayed.I have to comment out the  so that my app works.I\'m looking at the Hero plucker but I don\'t see any difference.Here is the component file:In order to be able to use two-way data binding for form inputs you need to import theFormsModule package in your Angular module.\nFor more info see the Angular 2 official tutorial here and the official documentation for formsYes that\'s it, in the app.module.ts, I just added :Throwing in this might help someone.Assuming you have created a new NgModule, say AuthModule dedicated to handling your Auth needs, make sure to import FormsModule in that AuthModule too.If you\'ll be using the FormsModule ONLY in the AuthModule then you wouldn\'t need to import the FormModule IN the default AppModuleSo something like this in the AuthModule:Then forget about importing in AppModule if you don\'t use the FormsModule anywhere else.There are two steps you need to follow to get rid of this errorbasically app.module.ts should look like below :Hope it helps import FormsModule in you app module.it would let your application running well.If someone is still getting errors after applying the accepted solution, it could be possibly because you have a separate module file for the component in which you want to use the ngModel property in input tag. In that case, apply the accepted solution in the component\'s module.ts file as well.I know this question is about Angular 2, but I am on Angular 4 and none of these answers helped.In Angular 4 the syntax needs to be Hope this helps.When I first did the tutorial, main.ts looked slightly different from what it is now. It looks very similar, but note the differences (the top one is correct).Correct:Old tutorial code:This is for the folks who use plain JavaScript instead of Type Script. In addition to referencing the forms script file on top of the page like belowyou should also tell the the module loader to load the ng.forms.FormsModule. After making the changes my imports property of NgModule method looked like belowimports: [ng.platformBrowser.BrowserModule, ng.forms.FormsModule],Happy coding!Sometimes you get this error when you try to use a component from a module, which is not shared, in a different module.For example, you have 2 modules with module1.componentA.component.ts and module2.componentC.component.ts and you try to use the selector from module1.componentA.component.ts in a template inside module2 (e.g. <module1-componentA [someInputVariableInModule1]="variableFromHTTPRequestInModule2">),  it will throw the error that the someInputVariableInModule1 is not available inside module1.componentA.component.ts - even though you have the @Input() someInputVariableInModule1 in the module1.componentA.If this happens, you want to share the module1.componentA to be accessible in other modules.\nSo if you share the module1.componentA inside a sharedModule, the module1.componentA will be usable inside other modules (outside from module1), and every module importing the sharedModule will be able to access the selector in their templates injecting the @Input() declared variable.I upgraded from RC1 to RC5 and received this error. I completed my migration (introducing a new app.module.ts file, changing package.json to include new versions and missing modules, and finally changing my main.ts to boot accordingly, based on the Angular2 quick start example). I did an npm update and then an npm outdated to confirm the versions installed were correct, still no luck.I ended up completely wiping the node_modules folder and reinstalling with npm install - Voila! Problem solved.if you are still getting the error after importing FormsModule correctly then check in your console because your project is not compiling (because of another error that could be anything) and your solution has not been reflected in your browser! In my case, my console hay the following unrelated error: Property \'retrieveGithubUser\' does not exist on type \'ApiService\'.
