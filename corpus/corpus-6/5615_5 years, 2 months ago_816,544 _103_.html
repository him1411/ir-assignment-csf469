I installed LAMP on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) and then set root password on phpMyAdmin. I forgot the password and now I am unable to login. When I try to change password through terminal I get:ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can\'t connect to local MySQL server through socket\n   \'/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\' (2)How can I fix this? I am unable to open LAMP, uninstall it or reinstall it.I once had this problem and solved it by installing mysql-server, so make sure that you have installed the mysql-server, not the mysql-client or something else.That error means the file /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock doesn\'t exists, if you didn\'t install mysql-server, then the file would not exist. But if the mysql-server is already installed and is running, then you need to check the config files.The config files are:In /etc/my.cnf, the socket file config may be /tmp/mysql.sock and in /etc/mysql/my.cnf the socket file config may be /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock. So, remove or rename /etc/mysql/my.cnf, let mysql use /etc/my.cnf, then the problem may solved.Try this:Also (to see if it\'s running):Probably it is just a misconfiguration in the my.cnf file, in /etc/somewhere (depending on the Linux distribution).I am seeing all these answers, but none offer the option to reset the password and no accepted answer. The actual question being he forgot his password, so he needs to reset, not see if it\'s running or not (installed or not) as most of these answers imply.Follow these steps (can be helpful if you really forget your password and you can try it anytime, even if you\'re not in the situation at the moment):Stop mysqlOr for other distribution versions:Start MySQL in safe modeLog into MySQL using rootSelect the MySQL database to useReset the passwordFlush the privilegesRestart the serverStop and start the server againUbuntu and Debian:On CentOS, Fedora, and RHEL:Login with a new passwordType the new password and enjoy your server again like nothing happenedThis was taken from Reset a MySQL root password.Update taken from @Daniel\'s comment below:In MySQL 5.7, the password field in mysql.user table field was removed, and now the field name is \'authentication_string\', so step 5 should be:I tried the following steps:And it worked for me.I had a similar problem.  mysql wouldn\'t start:If I disabled apparmor:the problem went away.  The issue was that mysqld was trying to access /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock but the apparmor profile only gave permission to /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (/var/run is symlinked to /run, so these are actually the same).  Not sure why mysqld isn\'t using the var path since that\'s what\'s set in all the configuration files, but you can fix the problem by adding the following to /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqldI solved this by killing the mysql process:And then I started the server again with:But start works as well:Then I logged in as admin, and I was done.I fixed this problem by executing the following command: And if you are on a mac and used brew to install mysql, simply use:  Somehow the MySQL server process did not create the socket, or the client is looking for the socket in the wrong place.My first suggestion would be to check if the MySQL server is running. Second suggestion might be, is the MySQL server running on another host? If so, add the -h <hostname> flag to your MySQL client in the terminal.If MySQL is indeed running, and running locally, check your my.cnf file. There should be a line likeSee if that matches the socket location that you mentioned in your post. From experience, I would say the most likely scenario is your MySQL server either is not running at all or is not running on the same host as where you run your MySQL client from the terminal.Your mysql-server might not be running. Ensure it runs by typing mysql.server start into the terminal.I just experienced the same issue after I had to restart my production server. I am running Debian 8.1 (Jessie) on a DigitalOcean droplet.This is what I did to resolve my issue:Check if the file /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. If it doesn\'t, manually create it by entering touch /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock (which is what I had to do).So the MySQL process can use this file. Change ownership of said file by entering chown mysql /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock.Once \'2\' has been done, restart the MySQL service by entering service mysql restart or /etc/init.d/mysql restart.After going through the above steps, my issue was solved. I rarely have this issue, and there is probably a better way, so by all means provide constructive feedback if need be :).Here\'s what worked for me:This creates a link.In my case it was that the disk was full and mysqld couldn\'t start anymore.I think whenever you get the errorERROR 2002 (HY000): Can\'t connect to local MySQL server through socket \'/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock\'I will recommend first to check whether your mysql daemon is running... Most of the time it will not running by default. You can check it by /etc/init.d/mysqld status.If it\'s not running then start it first:I bet it will 110% work.If you\'re using Amazon EC2, and you\'re having this problem on the instance, then you only need to do:Amazon EC2 doesn\'t have a server installed (only the client is installed), so in case of that you need to install that on your instance, and after that tryto check if that worked.Instead of using localhost:Use 127.0.0.1(also note, no space between -p and mypassword)Enjoy :)Make sure you have backups of important databases and then try uninstall MySQL related stuff:Then install it again:This worked for me and data was kept.If PHP MySQL shows errors you might have to reinstall PHP MySQL:If you have XAMPP installed on your Linux machine, try to copy your my.cnf file from /opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf to /etc/my.cnf.Then, run the mysql -u root again... You should now have the correct socket and be able to run the MySQL client.I got this problem too, but I just did:It worked for me.In my case, the default port 3306 was being used by some other process and thus it was not starting. After I stopped the other service and did sudo service mysql start, it worked fine. BTW, you can use something like sudo lsof -Pn -iTCP:3306 to see who may be using the port.Check the "bind-adress" parameter.Else try with the command:-h for host 127.0.0.1, that is, localhost-P (notice -P as uppercase) for port 2206, that is, the default port for MySQLIn my case it worked by doing some R&D:I am able to connect to MySQL usingBut it\'s not working with mysql -u root -p.I did not find any bind-address in my.cnf. So I outcommented the parameter socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysqld.sock in my.cnf which was causing me a problem with login.After restarting the service it went fine:I had the same issue. Sometimes this happens if your MySQL service is turned down.So you have to start it:I had the same problem. After much searching I didn\'t find any answer.At last, I checked the /tmp directory, and its permissions were 755. I changed its permissions to 777 and mysqld started well without any problem.Open the terminal and type:Both MySQL database core client and MySQL Server packages will be the same version 5.5. MySQL Client 5.5 and MySQL Server 5.5 are the current "best" versions of these packages in Ubuntu 14.04 as determined by the package maintainers. If you would rather install MySQL Client 5.6 and MySQL Server 5.6 you can also find the mysql-client-core-5.6 and mysql-server-5.6 packages in the Ubuntu Software Center. The important thing is that the client and server version numbers match in either case.This worked for me.Check if you have the correct rights:I had the same problems and this worked for me. After doing this I was able to start MySQL.The same on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr).If you have installed XAMPP, installing mysql-server isn\'t the solution, because you\'ll access another MySQL!You have to use the right socket to access. Usually it is this:Instead, change it to:It works now...I have followed the tutorial Installing MariaDB 10.1.16 on Mac OS X with Homebrew to overcome this issue.But don\'t forget to kill or uninstall the old installation of MariaDB.If your installation was recent, you should to confirm if your installation is the installation SERVER... as mysql-server-5.5.. Maybe you installed only "mysql" .. this is only client instead of the server.By experience I say that you need to check if the server is running first and then try configuring MySQL. The last solution is to re-install MySQL.
