I have the Atom editor and was wondering how you can open a file or folder from the terminal in Atom. I am using a Mac. I am looking for a way to do this:Is this possible and how do I set it up?When Atom installs it automatically creates a symlink in your /usr/local/bin. However in case it hasn\'t, you can create it yourself on your MacNow you can use atom folder_name to open a folder and atom file_name to open a file. Hope this helps.With the Atom editor open, in the menu bar:Click Atom >> Install Shell CommandsYou should expect to see:Potentially restart your terminal. (I did just out of habit, not sure if you need to)For Windows 7 x64 with default Atom installation add this to your PATHand restart any running consoles(if you don\'t find Atom there - right-click Atom icon and navigate to Target)Roll your own with @Clockworks solution, or in Atom, choose the menu option Atom > Install Shell Commands. This creates two symlinks in /usr/local/binThe atom command lets you do exactly what you\'re asking. apmis the command line package manager.The symlink solution for this stopped working for me in zsh today. I ended up creating an alias in my .zshrc file instead:alias atom=\'sh /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh\'For Windows10 and new release of atom i solved the problem by adding in my ENV VARIABLE on the "PATH" rowIn addition to @sbedulin (Greeting, lovely Windows users!)The general path on Windows should beIf you are using a bash emulator like babun.\nYou\'d better checkout the shell files, which only available in the real app foldersOpen the application by name:Another simple solution is to add /usr/local/bin to your PATH. I had the same issue, I installed shell commands (see shaheenery\'s response) the symlinks already existed and pointing to the correct destination (see thomax\'s response), however I would still get \'not found\'. I\'m using Korn Shell btw.Here\'s what I did:Upgrading Atom appears to break command line functionality on the occasion. Looks like in my case it created two versions of the application instead of overwriting them. Occurs because the new file structure doesn\'t match file paths created by "Atom -> Install Shell Commands". In order fix the issue you\'ll need to do the following.After that everything should work just like it did before. Hopefully this saves someone 30 minutes of poking around.add path(:/usr/local/bin/) in profile.mac: $home/.bash_profileexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:$PATHI am on mingw bash, so I have created ~.profile file with following:\nalias atom=\'~/AppData/Local/atom/bin/atom\'With conemu on windows 10 I couldn\'t call atom from console even after I added %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\bin to PATH in environment variables. I just addedto my .bashrc file.I had problems due to atom being unable to write its logfile when starting from the commandline. This cured it.sudo chmod 777 ~/.atom/nohup.out
