Does anyone know how to add or create a custom HTTP header using JavaScript or jQuery?There are several solutions depending on what you need...If you want to add a custom header (or set of headers) to an individual request then just add the headers property:If you want to add a default header (or set of headers) to every request then use $.ajaxSetup():If you want to add a header (or set of headers) to every request  then use the beforeSend hook with $.ajaxSetup():Edit (more info): One thing to be aware of is that with ajaxSetup you can only define one set of default headers and you can only define one beforeSend.  If you call ajaxSetup multiple times, only the last set of headers will be sent and only the last before-send callback will execute.Or, if you want to send the custom header for every future request, then you could use the following:This way every future ajax request will contain the custom header, unless explicitly overridden by the options of the request. You can find more info on ajaxSetup hereHere\'s an example using XHR2:Hope that helps.If you create your object, you can use the setRequestHeader function to assign a name, and a value before you send the request.Assuming JQuery ajax, you can add custom headers like - You can also do this without using jQuery. Override XMLHttpRequest\'s send method and add the header there: Assuming that you mean "When using ajax" and "An HTTP Request header", then use the headers property in the object you pass to ajax()headers(added 1.5)Default: {}A map of additional header key/value pairs to send along with the request. This setting is set before the beforeSend function is called; therefore, any values in the headers setting can be overwritten from within the beforeSend function.\xe2\x80\x94 http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/You should avoid the usage of $.ajaxSetup() as described in the docs. Use the following instead:"setRequestHeader" method of XMLHttpRequest object should be usedhttp://help.dottoro.com/ljhcrlbv.php
