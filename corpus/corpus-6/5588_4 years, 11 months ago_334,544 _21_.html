I would like to find the fastest way to check if a file exist in standard C++11, C++, or C. I have thousands of files and before doing something on them I need to check if all of them exist. What can I write instead of /* SOMETHING */ in the following function?  Well I threw together a test program that ran each of these methods 100,000 times, half on files that existed and half on files that didn\'t.Results for total time to run the 100,000 calls averaged over 5 runs,The stat() function provided the best performance on my system (Linux, compiled with g++), with a standard fopen call being your best bet if you for some reason refuse to use POSIX functions. I use this piece of code, it works OK with me so far. This does not use many fancy features of C++:Remark : in C++14 and as soon as the filesystem TS will be finished and adopted, the solution will be to use:and hopefully in C++17, only:It depends on where the files reside. For instance, if they are all supposed to be in the same directory, you can read all the directory entries into a hash table and then check all the names against the hash table. This might be faster on some systems than checking each file individually. The fastest way to check each file individually depends on your system ... if you\'re writing ANSI C, the fastest way is fopen because it\'s the only way (a file might exist but not be openable, but you probably really want openable if you need to "do something on it"). C++, POSIX, Windows all offer additional options.While I\'m at it, let me point out some problems with your question. You say that you want the fastest way, and that you have thousands of files, but then you ask for the code for a function to test a single file (and that function is only valid in C++, not C). This contradicts your requirements by making an assumption about the solution ... a case of the XY problem. You also say "in standard c++11(or)c++(or)c" ... which are all different, and this also is inconsistent with your requirement for speed ... the fastest solution would involve tailoring the code to the target system. The inconsistency in the question is highlighted by the fact that you accepted an answer that gives solutions that are system-dependent and are not standard C or C++.For those who like boost:Same as suggested by PherricOxide but in CWithout using other libraries, I like to use the following code snippet:This works cross-platform for Windows and POSIX-compliant systems.Another 3 options under windows:You may also do bool b = std::ifstream(\'filename\').good();. Without the branch instructions(like if) it must perform faster as it needs to be called thousands of times.where R is your sequence of path-like things, and exists() is from the future std or current boost. If you roll your own, keep it simple,The branched solution isn\'t absolutely terrible and it won\'t gobble file descriptors,If you need to distinguish between a file and a directory, consider the following which both use stat which the fastest standard tool as demonstrated by PherricOxide:How about this Although there are several ways to do this the most efficient solution to your problem would probably be to use one of the fstream\'s predefined method such as good(). With this method you can check whether the file you\'ve specified exist or not.I hope you find this useful.
