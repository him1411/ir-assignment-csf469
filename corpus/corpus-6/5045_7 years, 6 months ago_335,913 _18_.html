This question already has an answer here:if I setin my hibernate.cfg.xml configuration file in the console I can see the SQL.But it\'s not real SQL... Can I see the SQL code that will be passed directly to database?Example:I see Can I seethe real SQL?Can I see (...) the real SQLIf you want to see the SQL sent directly to the database (that is formatted similar to your example), you\'ll have to use some kind of jdbc driver proxy like P6Spy (or log4jdbc).Alternatively you can enable logging of the following categories (using a log4j.properties file here):The first is equivalent to hibernate.show_sql=true, the second prints the bound parameters among other things.Some frameworks use persistence.xml:If you can already see the SQL being printed, that means you have the code below in your hibernate.cfg.xml:To print the bind parameters as well, add the following to your log4j.properties file:Worth noting that the code you see is sent to the database as is, the queries are sent separately to prevent SQL injection. AFAIK The ? marks are placeholders that are replaced by the number params by the database, not by hibernate.select this_.code from true.employee this_ where this_.code=? is what will be sent to your database.this_ is an alias for that instance of the employee table.
