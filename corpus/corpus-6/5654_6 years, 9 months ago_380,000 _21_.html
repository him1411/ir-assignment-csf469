Can anyone explain or suggest a tutorial to create a listView in android?

Thanks!Create an XML layout first in your project\'s res/layout/main.xml folder:This is a simple layout with a button on the top and a list view on the bottom. Note that the ListView has the id @android:id/list which defines the default ListView a ListActivity can use.android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1 is the default list item layout supplied by Android, and you can use this stock layout for non-complex things.listItems is a List which holds the data shown in the ListView.  All the insertion and removal should be done on listItems; the changes in listItems should be reflected in the view. That\'s handled by ArrayAdapter<String> adapter, which should be notified using:adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();An Adapter is instantiated with 3 parameters: the context, which could be your activity/listactivity; the layout of your individual list item; and lastly, the list, which is the actual data to be displayed in the list.instead of you can directly call First, you have to add a ListView, an EditText and a button into your activity_main.xml.Now, in your ActivityMain:This works for me, I hope I helped youIf you want to have the ListView in an AppCompatActivity instead of ListActivity, you can do the following (Modifying @Shardul\'s answer):And in you layout instead of using android:id="@android:id/list" you can use android:id="@+id/listDemo"So now you can have a ListView inside a normal AppCompatActivity.Code for MainActivity.java file.Code for activity_main.xml layout file.ScreenShot
