I would like to use google web starter kit. I installed node.js v0.12.0, node-sass & gulp.And then ran:When I typed gulp serve then got this error:I reinstalled node and gulp but this doesn\'t help.What should I do next?If your node version is 4 and you are using gulp-sass, then tryI found this useful command:From the rebuild documentation:This is useful when you install a new version of node (or switch node\n  versions), and must recompile all your C++ addons with the new node.js\n  binary.http://laravel.io/forum/10-29-2014-laravel-elixir-sass-errorI ran into this error using node 0.12.0 and it was fixed by deleting the existing /node_modules directory and running npm update.npm rebuild node-sass was giving me errors (Ubuntu) and npm install gulp-sass didn\'t make the error go away.Saw a solution on GitHub which worked for me:npm uninstall --save-dev gulp-sassnpm install --save-dev gulp-sassI had the same issue:The solution is to install node-sass version 2 which supports current versions of node. See https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/490#issuecomment-70388754Run:Then re-test:If you use Gulp then try:npm install gulp-sassI had the same problem and the gulp-sass package was the problem.Downgrading Node to 0.10.36 should do it per this thread on the node-sass github page: https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/490#issuecomment-70388754If you have NVM you can just: If you don\'t, you can find NVM and instructions here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvmi had the same problem today at work.npm rebuild node-sassdone the job for meThis answer is a bit orthogonal to the the OP, but --libsass bindings don\'t install properly with the node-sass wrapper on Node v4.0.0. I got the same error message as in the question (Error: \'libsass\' bindings not found. Try reinstalling \'node-sass\') but I ended up uninstalling Node v4.0.0 and installing v0.12.7 using nvm, via this script:https://gist.github.com/brock/5b1b70590e1171c4ab54and now libsass and node-sass are behaving properly.you may also want to npm remove gulp-sass and re-install gulp-sass if you\'ve switched node versions.I have same issue when gulp-sass version is 1.3.0, and fix it after upgrading to 2.1.0.If you came here because you upgraded nodejs systemwide & suddenly your emberjs ^1.13 app is failing with this message, make sure you\'re not using an outdated version of ember-cli-sass. You\'ll need to rm -rf node_modules bower_components dist tmp within the Ember app, then update your package.json with the appropriate ember-cli-sass version, and finally npm install --save-dev. This fixed it for me, without having to rebuild or change any other dependencies.I removed all the /node_modules folder then ran npm install and it worked.I have node v5.5.0, npm 3.3.12For me, this issue was caused in my build system (Travis CI) by doing something kind of dumb in my .travis.yml file. In effect, I was calling npm install before nvm use 0.12, and this was causing node-sass to be built for 0.10 instead of 0.12. My solution was simply moving nvm use out of the .travis.yml file\xe2\x80\x99s before_script section to before the npm install command, which was in the before_install section.In your case, it is likely that whatever process you are starting with gulp is using a different version of node (than what you would expect).I had the same issue as @Kos had, only for some reason I had to modify the gulp-sass package from the old package.json file I had. It then installed the dependencies currently and now it finally works!My issue was that I was on a machine with node version 0.12.2, but that had an old 1.x.x version of npm. Be sure to update your version of npm: sudo npm install -g npm Once that is done, remove any existing node-sass and reinstall it via npm.You need to use the right version. Try:
