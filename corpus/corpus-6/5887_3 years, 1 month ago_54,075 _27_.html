I was doing attempting to do some updates to openssl using homebrew and I somehow managed to break everything. I can\'t do anything now, this is what I get when I try to do bundle install:I just fixed a similar issue on my system. You need to rebuild your install of Ruby 2.1.2 and it will re-link against the newly-updated SSL.I had a similar issue after upgrading openssl. I use rvm. I stared by upgrading rvm.I next reinstalled 1.9.3.After reinstalling, I ran:If you see any errors restoring your gemset, your best option will be to empty the gemset and rebuild it.If you have multiple gemsets, you will have to repeat these steps for each one of them.Have same issue for 1.9.3-p547, under rvmRuby gets re-installed, but fails in setting up a gemset_pristine for the application becausewhich was the reason I got to this point in the first place. Vicious frustration circle...update\nCheck your platform version. I have for example Darwin 10.8 and that is not listed here.\nSo, unless your version of the libv8 gem has a precompiled binary for your platform, it is going to take a long (long-long) time.  Go out for dinner, a movie, chill out...  If enough ask, maybe they\'ll set up a binary distro...Had the same error and solved it by brew upgrade opensslI had the same issue for 2.1.2 and Ryan Dlugosz\'s excellent answer didn\'t go far enough. My problem was that I had multiple versions of openssl installed (I think I\'d installed through brew and git in previous projects).I had to delete /opt/local/bin/openssl and then rebuild 2.1.2.deleting RVMHow can I remove RVM (Ruby Version Manager) from my system? installing RVM, Rail$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s\n  $ rvm get stable\n  $ rvm requirements\n  $ rvm install 2.0.0 --with-openssl-dir=$HOME/.rvm/usr\n  $ rvm use 2.0.0\n  $ gem update --system 2.0.3\n  $ gem install rails --version 4.0.5    rbenv users:It helps to make sure that you are using the right version of ruby. If you reinstall rbenv or install a new ruby, change to the ruby version you just installed:$ rbenv local 2.1.3In case it might help anyone: I had a newer version of Ruby installed (2.1.2), and in my .ruby-version file I referenced the old one (2.0.0-p353)Changing my .ruby-version file to 2.1.2 fixed the issue for me.I had a similar problem, which occurred after upgrading to ruby 2.2.2.\nHowever, my environment is a little different causing the above solutions to not work.I\'m using:The following command(s) resolved this in my situation:In addition to the acceptance answers above, you may have to tell rbenv to use the newly installed version. For example, I had the old version in ~/.rbenv/version, so rbenv was always using the old one. Manually setting the new version in that file (or through the command line) should fix the problem.
