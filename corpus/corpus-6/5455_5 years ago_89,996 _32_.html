Using storyboard this is very easy. You just drag the action to "Exit". But how should I call it from my code?Insert Name of Segue to unwind.Then,- (void)performSegueWithIdentifier:(NSString *)identifier sender:(id)sender. with your segue identify.Here\'s a complete answer with Objective C and Swift:1) Create an IBAction unwind segue in your destination view controller (where you want to segue to). Anywhere in the implementation file.2) On the source view controller (the controller you\'re segueing from), \xe2\x8c\x83 + drag from "Name of activity" to exit. You should see the unwind segue created in step 1 in the popup. (If you don\'t see it, review step one). Pick unwindToContainerVC: from the popup, or whatever you named your method to connect your source controller to the unwind IBAction.3) Select the segue in the source view controller\'s document outline of the storyboard (it will be listed near the bottom), and give it an identifier. 4) Call the unwind segue using this method from source view controller, substituting your unwind segue name.// Objective C[self performSegueWithIdentifier:@"unwindToContainerVC" sender:self];// Swiftself.performSegueWithIdentifier("unwindToContainerVC", sender: self)NB. Use the sourceViewController property of the segue parameter on the unwind method to access any exposed properties on the source controller. Also, notice that the framework handles dismissing the source controller. If you\'d like to confirm this add a dealloc method to the source controller with a log message that should fire once it has been killed. If dealloc doesn\'t fire you may have a retain cycle.bradleygriffith\'s answer was great. I took step 10 and made a screenshot for simplification. This is a screenshot in Xcode 6.Simply Control-drag from the orange icon to the red Exit icon to create an unwind without any actions/buttons in the view.Then select the unwind segue and set some identifier to access it from code.In code,I used [self dismissViewControllerAnimated: YES completion: nil]; which will return you to the calling ViewController.Quoting text from Apple\'s Technical Note on Unwind Segue:\nTo add an unwind segue that will only be triggered programmatically, control+drag from the scene\'s view controller icon to its exit icon, then select an unwind action for the new segue from the popup menu.Link to Technical NoteVishal Chaudhry\'s answer above worked for me. I would also add that in order to manually trigger the seque using: from within the ViewController you must also select the unwind segue under the ViewController\'s Scene in the storyboard and in the properties view on the RHS ensure that the Indentifier field contains the namer you\'re referring to in the code ("mySegueName" in the example above).If you omit this step, the line above will throw an exception that the seque name is not known.Backwards compatible solution that will work for versions prior to ios6, for those interested:FYI: In order for @Vadim\'s answer to work with a manual unwind seque action called from within a View Controller you must place the command:inside of the overriden class method viewDidAppear like so:If you put it in other ViewController methods like viewDidLoad or viewWillAppear it will be ignored.
