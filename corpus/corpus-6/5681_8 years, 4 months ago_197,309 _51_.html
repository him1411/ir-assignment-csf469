What is the difference between a user and a schema in Oracle? From Ask TomYou should consider a schema to be the user account and collection of all objects therein \nas a schema for all intents and purposes.SCOTT is a schema that includes the EMP, DEPT and BONUS tables with various grants, and \nother stuff.SYS is a schema that includes tons of tables, views, grants, etc etc etc.SYSTEM is a schema.....Technically -- A schema is the set of metadata (data dictionary) used by the database, \ntypically generated using DDL. A schema defines attributes of the database, such as \ntables, columns, and properties.   A database schema is a description of the data in a \ndatabase.I believe the problem is that Oracle uses the term schema slightly differently from what it generally means.Schema in sense 2. is similar, but not the same as schema in sense 1. E.g. for an application that uses several DB accounts, a schema in sense 2 might consist of several Oracle schemas :-).Plus schema can also mean a bunch of other, fairly unrelated things in other contexts (e.g. in mathematics).Oracle should just have used a term like "userarea" or "accountobjects", instead of overloadin "schema"...Think of a user as you normally do (username/password with access to log in and access some objects in the system) and a schema as the database version of a user\'s home directory.  User "foo" generally creates things under schema "foo" for example, if user "foo" creates or refers to table "bar" then Oracle will assume that the user means "foo.bar".From WikiAnswers:Furthermore, a user can access objects in schemas other than their own, if they have permission to do so.This answer does not define the difference between an owner and schema but I think it adds to the discussion.In my little world of thinking:I have struggled with the idea that I create N number of users where I want each of these users to "consume" (aka, use) a single schema.Tim at oracle-base.com shows how to do this (have N number of users and each of these users will be "redirected" to a single schema.He has a second "synonym" approach (not listed here). I am only quoting the CURRENT_SCHEMA version (one of his approaches) here:CURRENT_SCHEMA ApproachThis method uses the CURRENT_SCHEMA session attribute to automatically\n  point application users to the correct schema.First, we create the schema owner and an application user.Notice that the application user can connect, but does not have any\n  tablespace quotas or privileges to create objects.Next, we create some roles to allow read-write and read-only access.We want to give our application user read-write access to the schema\n  objects, so we grant the relevant role.We need to make sure the application user has its default schema\n  pointing to the schema owner, so we create an AFTER LOGON trigger to\n  do this for us.Now we are ready to create an object in the schema owner.Notice how the privileges are granted to the relevant roles. Without\n  this, the objects would not be visible to the application user. We now\n  have a functioning schema owner and application user.This method is ideal where the application user is simply an\n  alternative entry point to the main schema, requiring no objects of\n  its own.It\'s very simple.A user may be given access to schema objects owned by different Users.Schema is an encapsulation of DB.objects about an idea/domain of intrest, and owned by ONE user. It then will be shared by other users/applications with suppressed roles. So users need not own a schema, but a schema needs to have an owner.A schema and database users are same but if schema has owned database objects and they can do anything their object but user just access the objects, They can\'t DO any DDL operations until schema user give you the proper privileges.Based on my little knowledge of Oracle... a USER and a SCHEMA are somewhat similar. But there is also a major difference. A USER can be called a SCHEMA if the "USER" owns any object, otherwise ... it will only remain a "USER". Once the USER owns at least one object then by virtue of all of your definitions above.... the USER can now be called a SCHEMA.User: Access to resource of the database. Like a key to enter a house.Schema: Collection of information about database objects. Like Index in your book which contains the short information about the chapter.Look here for detailsA user account is like relatives who holds a key to your home, but does not own anything i.e. a user account does not own any database object...no data dictionary...Whereas a schema is an encapsulation of database objects. It\'s like the owner of the house who owns everything in your house and a user account will be able to access the goods at the home only when the owner i.e. schema gives needed grants to it.--USER and SCHEMAThe both words user and schema are interchangeble,thats why most people get confusion on this words below i explained the difference between them--User User is a account to connect database(Server). we can create user by using CREATE USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY password .--SchemaActually Oracle Database contain logical and physical strucutre to process the data.The Schema Also Logical Structure to process the data in Database(Memory Component). Its Created automatically by oracle when user created.It Contains All Objects created by the user associated to that schema.For Example if i created a user with name santhosh then oracle createts a schema called santhosh,oracle stores all objects created by user santhosh in santhosh schema.We can create schema by CREATE SCHEMA statement ,but Oracle Automatically create a user for that schema.We can Drop the schema by using DROP SCHEMA schama_name RESTRICT statement but it can not delete scehema contains objects,so to drop schema it must be empty.here the restrict word forcely specify that schema with out objects.If we try to drop a user contain objects in his schema we must specify CASCADE word because oracle does not allow you to delete user contain objects. \nDROP USER user_name CASCADE \nso oracle deletes the objects in schema and then it drops the user automatically,Objects refered to this schema objects from other schema like views and private synonyms goes to invalid state.I hope now you got the difference between them,if you have any doubts on this topic,please feel free to ask.Thank you.Schema is a container of objects.\nIt is owned by a user.Well, I read somewhere that if your database user has the DDL privileges then it\'s a schema, else it\'s a user.
