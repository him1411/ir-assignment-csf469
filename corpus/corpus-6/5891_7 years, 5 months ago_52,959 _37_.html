Assume I\'ve got some arbitrary layout of splits in vim.  Is there a way to swap one and two and maintain the same layout?  It\'s simple in this example, but I\'m looking for a solution that will help for more complex layouts.I guess I should be more clear.  My previous example was a simplification of the actual use-case.  With an actual instance:\nHow could I swap any two of those splits, maintaining the same layout?I put sgriffin\'s solution in a Vim plugin you can install with ease! Install it with your favorite plugin manager and give it a try: WindowSwap.vim A bit late to the post, but came across this searching for something else.  I wrote two functions awhile back to mark a window and then swap buffers between windows.  This seems to be what you\'re asking for.  Just slap these in your .vimrc and map the functions how you see fit:To use (assuming your mapleader is set to \\) you would: Voila!  Swapped buffers without screwing up your window layout!Starting with this:Make \'three\' the active window, then issue the command ctrl+w J. This moves the current window to fill the bottom of the screen, leaving you with:Now make either \'one\' or \'two\' the active window, then issue the command ctrl+w r. This \'rotates\' the windows in the current row, leaving you with:Now make \'two\' the active window, and issue the command ctrl+w H. This moves the current window to fill the left of the screen, leaving you with:As you can see, the manouevre is a bit of a shuffle. With 3 windows, it\'s a bit like one of those \'tile game\' puzzles. I don\'t recommand trying this if you have 4 or more windows - you\'d be better off closing them then opening them again in the desired positions. I made a screencast demonstrating how to work with split windows in Vim.Take a look at :h ctrl-w_ctrl-x and/or :h ctrl-w_ctrl-r.  These commands allow you to exchange or rotate windows in the current layout.Edit: Actually, this will not work in this situation because it only will swap in the current column or row.  You could instead go to each of the windows and select the target buffer, but that\'s pretty verbose.Randy\'s correct in that CTRL-W x doesn\'t want to swap windows that aren\'t in the same column/row.I\'ve found that the CTRL-W HJKL keys are most useful when manipulating windows. They will force your current window out of its current location and tell it to occupy the entire edge indicated by the direction of the key you press. See :help window-moving for more details.For your example above, if you start in window "one", this does what you want:For convenience, you can assign the sequences you need to key mappings (see :help mapping).I have a slightly enhanced version from sgriffin\'s solution, you can swap windows without using two commands, but with intuitive HJKL commands.So here is how it goes:Try to move your window by using capital HJKL in normal node, it is really cool :)Building heavily on @sgriffin\'s answer, here\'s something even closer to what you\'re asking for:Please let me know if the behavior doesn\'t match your expectations.The following approach may be convenient if functions are not available for some reason (f.e. it\'s not your vim).Use :buffers command to find out id\'s of open buffers, navigate to desired window and use command like :b 5 to open a buffer (buffer number 5 in this case). Repeate two times and contents of windows are swapped.I "invented" this method after several attempts to memorise ctrl-w-something sequences even for very simple layouts like one-two-three in original question.Really cool, but my proposal for the mapping is to use ^W^J instead of J (because all of H J K L already have meanings), plus also I\'d pull in the new buffer, because by the time you want to swap around you probably don\'t want to continue editing the buffer you are already on. Here goes:Also based on sgriffin\'s solution, go to the window you want to swap, press CTRL-w m, go to the window you want to swap with and press CTRL-w m again.CTRL-w m is a poor mnemonic choice, so if anybody comes up with a better one, please edit this.Also, I\'d like to receive a feedback from the script aka "Window marked. Please repeat on target", however being a vimscript noob, I do not know how to do that.All that said, the script works well as isSimilar mark-window-then-swap-buffer approach, but also let you reuse last swapping.You could also use a tiling window manager like X-monad
