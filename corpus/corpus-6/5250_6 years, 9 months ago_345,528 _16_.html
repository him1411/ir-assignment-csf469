I have the following code. I would like to have it such that if price_result equals an integer, let\'s say 10, then I would like to add two decimal places. So 10 would be 10.00.\nOr if it equals 10.6 would be 10.60. Not sure how to do this.You can use toFixed() to do thatWhen you use toFixed, it always returns the value as a string. This sometimes complicates the code. To avoid that, you can make an alternative method for Number.and use:or simply:If you need performance (like in games):It\'s about 100 times as fast as parseFloat(number.toFixed(2))http://jsperf.com/parsefloat-tofixed-vs-math-roundTo return a number, add another layer of parentheses. Keeps it clean.I\'ve got other solution.You can use round() to do that instead toFixed()Try this (see comments in code):Please use below function if you don\'t want to round off.For what its worth: A decimal number, is a decimal number, you either round it to some other value or not. Internally, it will approximate a decimal fraction according to the rule of floating point arthmetic and handling. It stays a decimal number (floating point, in JS a double) internally, no matter how you many digits you want to display it with.To present it for display, you can choose the precision of the display to whatever you want by string conversion. Presentation is a display issue, not a storage thing.simple javascript string to float
