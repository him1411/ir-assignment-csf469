I\'m looking for something to this effect:Any ideas?Check current scrollTop vs previous scrollTop You can do it without having to keep track of the previous scroll top, as all the other examples require:I am not an expert on this so feel free to research it further, but it appears that when you use $(element).scroll, the event being listened for is a \'scroll\' event. But if you specifically listen for a mousewheel event by using bind, the originalEvent attribute of the event parameter to your callback contains different information.  Part of that information is wheelDelta.  If it\'s positive, you moved the mousewheel up.  If it\'s negative, you moved the mousewheel down. My guess is that mousewheel events will fire when the mouse wheel turns, even if the page does not scroll; a case in which \'scroll\' events probably are not fired.  If you want, you can call event.preventDefault() at the bottom of your callback to prevent the page from scrolling, and so that you can use the mousewheel event for something other than a page scroll, like some type of zoom functionality.Store the previous scroll location, then see if the new one is greater than or less than that.Here\'s a way to avoid any global variables (fiddle available here):There could be 3 solution from this posting and other answer.Solution 1Solution 2Solution 3I couldn\'t tested it on Safarichrome 42 (Win 7)Firefox 37 (Win 7)IE 11 (Win 8)IE 10 (Win 7)IE 9 (Win 7)IE 8 (Win 7)I checked that side effect from IE 11 and IE 8 is come from if else statement. So, I replaced it with if else if statement as following.From the multi browser test, I decided to use Solution 3 for common browsers and Solution 1 for firefox and IE 11.I referred this answer to detect IE 11.I understand there has already been an accepted answer, but wanted to post what I am using in case it can help anyone. I get the direction like cliphex with the mousewheel event but with support for Firefox. It\'s useful doing it this way in case you are doing something like locking scroll and can\'t get the current scroll top.See a live version here.The scroll event behaves oddly in FF (it is fired a lot of times because of the smoothness scrolling) but it works.Note: The scroll event actually is fired when dragging the scroll bar, using cursor keys or mousewheel.\nYou also may take a look at MDN, it exposes a great information about the Wheel Event.Note: The wheel event is fired only when using the mousewheel; cursor keys and dragging the scroll bar does not fire the event.I read the document and the example: Listening to this event across browser\nand after some tests with FF, IE, chrome, safari, I ended up with this snippet:\nIn case you just want to know if you scroll up or down using a pointer device (mouse or track pad) you can use the deltaY property of the wheel event.or use the mousewheel extension, see here.You can determin mousewhell direction.I have seen many version of good answers here but it seems some folks are having cross browser issues so this is my fix.I have used this successfully to detect direction in FF, IE and Chrome ... I haven\'t tested it in safari  as I use windows typically.Keep in mind I also use this to stop any scrolling so if you want scrolling to still occur you must remove the e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();To ignore any snap / momentum / bounce back at the top and bottom of the page, here is a modified version of Josiah\'s accepted answer:stock an increment in the .data () of element scrolled, you will then be able to test number of times the scroll reached top.Use this to find the scroll direction. This is only to find the direction of the Vertical Scroll. Supports all cross browsers.ExampleFor those having problems with elastic scrolling, please use this answerHow to detect scroll directionin the .data() of the element you can store a JSON and test values to launch eventsthis may helpThis is simple and easy detection for when the user scrolls away from the top of the page and for when they return to the top.This is an optimal solution for detecting the direction just when the user end scrolling.Keep it super simple:jQuery Event Listener Way:Vanilla JavaScript Event Listener Way:Function Remains The Same:I wrote a more indepth post on it here\n\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bYou can use both scroll and mousewheel option to track up and down movement at once.You can replace \'body\' with (window) as well.You Should try this
