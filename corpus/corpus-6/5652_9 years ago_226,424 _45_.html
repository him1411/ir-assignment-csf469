Say I have two strings,I want to perform a check returning that s2 is contained within s1. I can do this with:I am pretty sure that contains() is case sensitive, however I can\'t determine this for sure from reading the documentation. If it is then I suppose my best method would be something like:All this aside, is there another (possibly better) way to accomplish this without caring about case-sensitivity?Yes, contains is case sensitive.  You can use java.util.regex.Pattern with the CASE_INSENSITIVE flag for case insensitive matching:EDIT: If s2 contains regex special characters (of which there are many) it\'s important to quote it first.  I\'ve corrected my answer since it is the first one people will see, but vote up Matt Quail\'s since he pointed this out.One problem with the answer by Dave L. is when s2 contains regex markup such as \\d, etc.You want to call Pattern.quote() on s2:You can use The Apache Commons library is very useful for this sort of thing. And this particular one may be better than regular expressions as regex is always expensive in terms of performance.Using regexp can be relatively slow. It (being slow) doesn\'t matter if you just want to check in one case. But if you have an array or a collection of thousands or hundreds of thousands of strings, things can get pretty slow.The presented solution below doesn\'t use regular expressions nor toLowerCase() (which is also slow because it creates another strings and just throws them away after the check).The solution builds on the String.regionMatches() method which seems to be unknown. It checks if 2 String regions match, but what\'s important is that it also has an overload with a handy ignoreCase parameter.This speed analysis does not mean to be rocket science, just a rough picture of how fast the different methods are.I compare 5 methods.Results (by calling the method 10 million times):Results in a table:Our method is 4x faster compared to lowercasing and using contains(), 10x faster compared to using regular expressions and also 3x faster even if the Pattern is pre-cached (and losing flexibility of checking for an arbitrary substring).If you\'re interested how the analysis was performed, here is the complete runnable application:Yes, this is achievable:This code will return the String "TRUE!" as it found that your characters were contained.A simpler way of doing this (without worrying about pattern matching) would be converting both Strings to lowercase:You can use regular expressions, and it works:DrJava would be an extremely easy way to test this when the documentation fails you.  Just type a couple of test cases into its Interactions window, and you should find out.I\'m not sure what your main question is here, but yes, .contains is case sensitive.Here\'s some Unicode-friendly ones you can make if you pull in ICU4j. I guess "ignore case" is questionable for the method names because although primary strength comparisons do ignore case, it\'s described as the specifics being locale-dependent. But it\'s hopefully locale-dependent in a way the user would expect.I did a test finding a case-insensitive match of a string. I have a Vector of 150,000 objects all with a String as one field and wanted to find the subset which matched a string. I tried three methods:Convert all to lower caseUse the String matches() methodUse regular expressionsTiming results are:No attempted match: 20 msecsTo lower match: 182 msecsString matches: 278 msecsRegular expression: 65 msecsThe regular expression looks to be the fastest for this use case.Basically, it is a method that takes two strings. It is supposed to be a not-case sensitive version of contains(). When using the contains method, you want to see if one string is contained in the other.This method takes the string that is "sub" and checks if it is equal to the substrings of the container string that are equal in length to the "sub". If you look at the for loop, you will see that it iterates in substrings (that are the length of the "sub") over the container string.Each iteration checks to see if the substring of the container string is equalsIgnoreCase to the sub.If you have to search an ASCII string in another ASCII string, such as a URL, you will find my solution to be better. I\'ve tested icza\'s method and mine for the speed and here are the results:The code:You could simply do something like this:Another easy-to-use method for finding a string inside a string is STRING.INDEXOF ()Found Index :4www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_string_indexof.htm
