Possible Duplicate: \n  How can I create a Zerofilled value using JavaScript? In JavaScript, I need to have padding.For example, if I have the number 9, it will be "0009". If I have a number of say 10, it will be "0010". Notice how it will always contain four digits.One way to do this would be to subtract the number minus 4 to get the number of 0s I need to put.Is there was a slicker way of doing this?Not a lot of "slick" going on so far:When you initialize an array with a number, it creates an array with the length set to that value so that the array appears to contain that many undefined elements. Though some Array instance methods skip array elements without values, .join() doesn\'t, or at least not completely; it treats them as if their value is the empty string. Thus you get a copy of the zero character (or whatever "z" is) between each of the array elements; that\'s why there\'s a + 1 in there.Example usage:Something like that?Bonus incomprehensible-but-slicker single-line ES6 version:ES6isms:Try:Now test:DEMOIn ES8 , we have new method padStart and  padEnd  which has below syntax.\'string\'.padStart(targetLength [,padString]):So now we can useFunny, I recently had to do this.Use like:Not beautiful, but effective.You did say you had a number-You could do something like this:Edit: This was just a basic idea for a function, but to add support for larger numbers (as well as invalid input), this would probably be better:This does 2 things:For fun, instead of using a loop to create the extra zeros:This is not really \'slick\' but it\'s faster to do integer operations than to do string concatenations for each padding 0.This function is also hardcoded to your particular need (4 digit padding), so it\'s not generic.Since you mentioned it\'s always going to have a length of 4, I won\'t be doing any error checking to make this slick. ;)Idea: Simply replace \'0000\' with number provided... Issue with that is, if input is 0, I need to hard-code it to return \'0000\'. LOL.This should be slick enough.JSFiddler: http://jsfiddle.net/Up5Cr/
