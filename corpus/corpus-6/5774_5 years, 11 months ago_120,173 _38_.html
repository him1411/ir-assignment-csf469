I\'m looking to prevent a line break after a hyphen - on a case-by-case basis that is compatible with all browsers.Example:I have this text:  3-3/8" which in HTML is this:  3-3/8&rdquo;The problem is that near the end of a line, because of the hyphen, it breaks and wraps to the next line instead of treating it like a full word...I\'ve tried inserting the "zero width no break character", &#65279; with no luck...I\'m seeing this in Safari and thinking it will be the same in all browsers.The following is my doctype and character encoding...Is there any way I can prevent these from line-breaking after the hyphen?  I do not need any solution that applies to the whole page... just something I can insert as needed, like a "zero width no break character", except one that works.Here is a Demo.  Simply make the frame narrower until the line breaks at the hyphen.http://jsfiddle.net/RagKH/Try using the non-breaking hyphen &#8209;. I\'ve replaced the dash with that character in your jsfiddle, shrunk the frame down as small as it can go, and the line doesn\'t split there any more.You could also wrap the relevant text withIE8/9 render the non-breaking hyphen mentioned in CanSpice\'s answer longer than a typical hyphen. It is the length of an en-dash instead of a typical hyphen. This display difference was a deal breaker for me.As I could not use the CSS answer specified by Deb I instead opted to use no break tags.In addition I found a specific scenario that caused IE8/9 to break on a hyphen.IE renders it like this.The following code reproduces the problem pictured above. I had to use a meta tag to force rendering to IE9 as IE10 has fixed the issue. No fiddle because it does not support meta tags.You can also do it "the joiner way" by inserting "U+2060 Word Joiner". If Accept-Charset permits, the unicode character itself can be inserted directly into the HTML output.Otherwise, it can be done using entity encoding. E.g. to join the text red-brown, use:or (decimal equivalent):. Another usable character is "U+FEFF Zero Width No-break Space"[⁠&hairsp;⁠1&hairsp;]:and (decimal equivalent):\n[1]: Note that while this method still works in major browsers like Chrome, it has been deprecated since Unicode 3.2.\nComparison of "the joiner way" with "U+2011 Non-breaking Hyphen":The word joiner can be used for all other characters, not just hyphens.When using the word joiner, most renderers will rasterize the text identically. On Chrome, FireFox, IE, and Opera, the rendering of normal hyphens, eg:a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p-q-r-s-t-u-v-w-x-y-zis identical to the rendering of normal hyphens (with U+2060 Word Joiner), eg:a-⁠b-⁠c-⁠d-⁠e-⁠f-⁠g-⁠h-⁠i-⁠j-⁠k-⁠l-⁠m-⁠n-⁠o-⁠p-⁠q-⁠r-⁠s-⁠t-⁠u-⁠v-⁠w-⁠x-⁠y-⁠zwhile the above two renders differ from the rendering of "Non-breaking Hyphen", eg:a‑b‑c‑d‑e‑f‑g‑h‑i‑j‑k‑l‑m‑n‑o‑p‑q‑r‑s‑t‑u‑v‑w‑x‑y‑z. (The extent of the difference is browser-dependent and font-dependent. E.g. when using a font declaration of "arial", Firefox and IE11 show relatively huge variations, while Chrome and Opera show smaller variations.)Comparison of "the joiner way" with <span class=c1></span> (CSS .c1 {white-space:nowrap;}) and <nobr></nobr>:The word joiner can be used for situations where usage of HTML tags is restricted, e.g. forms of websites and forums.On the spectrum of presentation and content, majority will consider the word joiner to be closer to content, when compared to tags.\n• As tested on Windows 8.1 Core 64-bit using:\n    • IE 11.0.9600.18205\n    • Firefox 43.0.4\n    • Chrome 48.0.2564.109 (Official Build) m (32-bit)\n    • Opera 35.0.2066.92\n
