I know this is a silly question but like much about learning Rails I find the documentation incredibly difficult to find/navigate. I\'m trying to generate a new model and forget the syntax for referencing another model\'s ID. I\'d look it up myself but haven\'t figured out, among all my rails documentation links, how to find the definitive source.$ rails g model Item name:string description:text (and here either reference:product or references:product). But the better question is where or how can I look this kind of silliness easily in the future so I don\'t need to bother you all with my dumb questions.Note: I\'ve learned the hard way that if I mistype one of these options and run my migration then Rails will totally screw up my database... and rake db:rollback is powerless against such screwups. I\'m sure I\'m just not understanding something but until I do... the "detailed" information returned by rails g model still leaves me scratching...See the table definitions section.To create a model that references another, use the rails model generator:That produces app/models/wheel.rb:And adds the following migration:When you run the migration, the following will end up in your db/schema.rb:As for documentation, a starting point for rails generators is Ruby on Rails:A Guide to The Rails Command Line which points you to API Documentation for more about available field types.$ rails g model Item name:string description:text product:referencesI too found the guides difficult to use. Easy to understand, but hard to find what I am looking for.Also, I have temp projects that I run the rails generate commands on. Then once I get them working I run it on my real project.Reference for the above code:  http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#associating-modelshttp://guides.rubyonrails.org should be a good site if you trying to get through the basic stuff in rails. Here is link to associate models while you generate them.\nhttp://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#associating-modelsRemember to not capitalize your text when writing this command.\nFor example:Do write:Do not write:At least it was a problem to me.A little bit late ! I had the same issue but my code was a little bit different.\ndef new\n @project = Project.new\nend\nand my form looked like this :<%= form_for @project do |f| %>\n     and so on....\n<% end %>\nThat was totally correct so I didn\'t know how to figure it out.Finally, just adding url: { projects: :create } after <%= form-for @project worked for me.I hope that can help anyone !
