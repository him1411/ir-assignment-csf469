Traditionally I use custom domains with my localhost development server. Something along the lines of:This has provided me a ton of flexibility when working with external API\'s such as Facebook. This has worked great in the past with the built in Visual Studio Development Server, because all I needed to do was add a CNAME to those DNS records pointing to 127.0.0.1.However I have not been able to get this to work with IIS Express. Everything I have tried seems to have failed. I have even added the correct XML config to the applicationHost.config file for IIS Express, but it doesn\'t seem to recognize the entries as valid as a true install of IIS would.Whenever I enter this line and try to request http://dev.example.com:1288 I get the following message:Bad Request - Invalid HostnameDoes anybody know if I am missing something obvious? Or did the IIS Express team really lack the foresight to see this type of use?This is what worked for me (Updated for VS 2013, see revision history for 2010, for VS 2015 see this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32744234/218971):Open %USERPROFILE%\\My Documents\\IISExpress\\config\\applicationhost.config (Windows XP, Vista, and 7) and edit the site definition in the <sites> config block to be along the lines of the following:If running MVC: make sure the applicationPool is set to one of the "Integrated" options (like "Clr2IntegratedAppPool").Some great advice from the comments:For Visual Studio 2015 the steps in the above answers apply but the applicationhost.config file is in a new location. in your "solution" folder follow the path, this is confusing if you upgraded and would have TWO versions of applicationhost.config on your machine.Within that folder you will see your applicationhost.config fileAlternatively you could just search your solution folder for the .config file and find it that way.I personally used the following configuration: With the following in my hosts file: And the following in my applicationhost.config file: Remember to run your instance of visual studio 2015 as an administrator! If you don\'t want to do this every time I recomend this:How to Run Visual Studio as Administrator by defaultI hope this helps somebody, I had issues when trying to upgrade to visual studio 2015 and realized that none of my configurations were being carried over. When using Visual Studio 2012 with IIS Express, changing an existing binding does not work permanently. (It may work until you close VS, but after that, things get really messed up.)The key is keeping the existing localhost binding and adding a new binding after it.Unless you\'re running as administrator, you\'ll also need to run netsh add urlacl (to give yourself permissions to run a non-localhost site as a standard user).If you want to allow any host name, the full process is as follows:From an administrator prompt, run the following commands (replacing portnumber with the port number you figured out in #1):You can also use your user name (DOMAIN\\USER) instead of everyone for better security.Add one more binding with the host name you want (in this case, *). For example:Note that, if want to open up all host names (*), you\'ll need two netsh commands (one for * and one for localhost). If you only want to open up a specific host name, you don\'t strictly need the second netsh command (localhost); just the one with your specific host name is sufficient.The invalid hostname indicates that the actual site you configured in the IIS Express configuration file is (most likely) not running. IIS Express doesn\'t have a process model like IIS does. For your site to run it would need to be started explicitly (either by opening and accessing from webmatrix, or from command line calling iisexpress.exe (from it\'s installation directory) with the /site parameter. In general, the steps to allow fully qualified DNS names to be used for local access are\nLet\'s use your example of the DNS name dev.example.comConfigure IIS Express binding for your site (eg:Site1) to include dev.example.com. Administrative privilege will be needed to use the binding. Alternatively, a one-time URL reservation can be made with http.sys using netsh http add urlacl url=http://dev.example.com:<port>/ user=<user_name>start iisexpress /site:Site1 or open Site1 in WebMatrixOn my WebMatrix IIS Express install changing from "*:80:localhost" to "*:80:custom.hostname" didn\'t work ("Bad Hostname", even with proper etc\\hosts mappings), but "*:80:" did work--and with none of the additional steps required by the other answers here.  Note that "*:80:*" won\'t do it; leave off the second asterisk.I was trying to integrate the public IP Address into my workflow and these answers didn\'t help (I like to use the IDE as the IDE). But the above lead me to the solution\n(after about 2 hours of beating my head against a wall to get this to integrate with Visual Studio 2012 / Windows 8) here\'s what ended up working for me. applicationhost.config generated by VisualStudio under C:\\Users\\usr\\Documents\\IISExpress\\configThe net result is you can browse to 192.168.2.102 in my case and test (for instance in an Android emulator. I really hope this helps someone else as this was definitely an irritating process for me.Apparently it is a security feature which I\'d love to see disabled.Following Jaro\'s advice, I was able to get this working under Windows XP and IIS Express (installed via Web Matrix) with a small modification and was not limited to only localhost. It\'s just a matter of setting the bindings correctly.If running MVC, then keep the applicationPool set to one of the "Integrated" options.The up-voted answer is valid.. and this information helped me quite a bit.  I know this topic has been discussed before but I wanted to add some additional input.\nPeople are saying that you must "manually edit" the application.config file in the Users IISExpress/Config directory.    This was a big issue for me because I wanted to distribute the configuration via Source control to various developers.What I found is that you can automate the updating of this file using the "C:\\Program Files\\IIS Express\\appcmd.exe" program.   It took a while to find out the control parameters but Ill share my findings here.  Essentially you can make a .bat file that runs both the NETSH command and the APPCMD.EXE (and perhaps swap out a host file if you like) to make host header configuration easy with IIS Express.Your install bat file would look something like this:I also will make a "Uninstall" bat file that will clean up these bindings..(because often times Im just faking out DNS so that I can work on code that is host name sensitive)I hope this information is helpful to someone.. It took me a bit to uncover.Like Jessa Flint above, I didn\'t want to manually edit .vs\\config\\applicationhost.config because I wanted the changes to persist in source control. I also didn\'t want to have a separate batch file. I\'m using VS 2015.Project Properties\xe2\x86\x92Build Events\xe2\x86\x92Pre-build event command line:\nJust make sure you change the port number to your desired port.David\'s solution is good. But I found the <script>alert(document.domain);</script> in the page still alerts "localhost" because the Project Url is still localhost even if it has been override with http://dev.example.com. Another issue I run into is that it alerts me the port 80 has already been in use even if I have disabled the Skype using the 80 port number as recommended by David Murdoch. So I have figured out another solution that is much easier:Note: The port number listed above is assumed to be 33333. You need to change it to the port number set by your visual studio.Post edited: Today I tried with another domain name and got the following error: Unable to launch the IIS Express Web server. Failed to register URL... Access is denied. (0x80070005). I exit the IIS Express by right clicking the IIS Express icon at the right corner in the Windows task bar, and then re-start my visual studio as administrator, and the issue is gone.I was using iisexpress-proxy (from npm) for this.https://github.com/icflorescu/iisexpress-proxyLeaving this here just in case anyone needs...I needed to have custom domains for a Wordpress Multisite setup in IIS Express but nothing worked until I ran Webmatrix/Visual Studio as an Administrator. Then I was able to bind subdomains to the same application.Then going to http://whatever.localhost:12345/ will run.
