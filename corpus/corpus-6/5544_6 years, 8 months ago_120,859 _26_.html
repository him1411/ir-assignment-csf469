What is the difference between ViewResult() and ActionResult() in ASP.NET MVC?ActionResult is an abstract class that can have several subtypes.ViewResult - Renders a specifed view to the response streamPartialViewResult - Renders a specifed partial view to the response streamEmptyResult - An empty response is returnedRedirectResult - Performs an HTTP redirection to a specifed URLRedirectToRouteResult - Performs an HTTP redirection to a URL that is determined  by the \nrouting engine, based on given route dataJsonResult - Serializes a given ViewData object to JSON formatJavaScriptResult - Returns a piece of JavaScript code that can be executed on the clientContentResult - Writes content to the response stream without requiring  a viewFileContentResult - Returns a file to the clientFileStreamResult - Returns a file to the client, which is provided by a StreamFilePathResult - Returns a file to the clientActionResult is an abstract class.ViewResult derives from ActionResult. Other derived classes include JsonResult and PartialViewResult.You declare it this way so you can take advantage of polymorphism and return different types in the same method.e.g:It\'s for the same reason you don\'t write every method of every class to return "object". You should be as specific as you can. This is especially valuable if you\'re planning to write unit tests. No more testing return types and/or casting the result.ViewResult is a subclass of ActionResult.  The View method returns a ViewResult.  So really these two code snippets do the exact same thing.  The only difference is that with the ActionResult one, your controller isn\'t promising to return a view - you could change the method body to conditionally return a RedirectResult or something else without changing the method definition.While other answers have noted the differences correctly, note that if you are in fact returning a ViewResult only it is better to return the more specific type rather than the base ActionResult type. An obvious exception to this principle is when your method returns multiple types deriving from ActionResult.For a full discussion of the reasons behind this principle please see the related discussion here: Must ASP.NET MVC Controller Methods Return ActionResult? In the Controller , one could use the below syntaxIn the above example , only the return type varies . one returns ViewResult whereas the other one returns ActionResult.ActionResult is an abstract class . It can accept:ViewResult , PartialViewResult, EmptyResult , RedirectResult , RedirectToRouteResult , JsonResult , JavaScriptResult , ContentResult, FileContentResult , FileStreamResult , FilePathResult etc.The ViewResult is a subclass of ActionResult.
