I have a pretty long sqlite query:How can I break it in a number of lines to make it easier to read?\nIf I do the following:I am getting a error.Is there a way to write queries in multiple lines?There are two ways to split strings over multiple lines:All lines in C can be split into multiple lines using \\.Plain C:Objective-C:There\'s a better approach that works just for strings.Plain C:Objective-C:The second approach is better, because there isn\'t a lot of whitespace included. For a SQL query however, both are possible.NOTE: With a #define, you have to add an extra \'\\\' to concatenate the two strings:Plain C:There\'s a trick you can do with the pre-processor.\nIt has the potential down sides that it will collapse white-space, and could be confusing for people reading the code.\nBut, it has the up side that you don\'t need to escape quote characters inside it.the preprocessor turns this into:I\'ve used this trick when I was writing some unit tests that had large literal strings containing JSON.  It meant that I didn\'t have to escape every quote character \\".You could also go into XCode -> Preferences, select the Indentation tab, and turn on Line Wrapping.That way, you won\'t have to type anything extra, and it will work for the stuff you already wrote. :-)One annoying thing though is...I am having this problem all the time, so I made a tiny tool to convert text to an escaped multi-line Objective-C string:http://multilineobjc.herokuapp.com/Hope this saves you some time.Extending the Quote idea for Objective-C:You can also do:One more solution for the pile, change your .m file to .mm so that it becomes Objective-C++ and use C++ raw literals, like this:Raw literals ignore everything until the termination sequence, which in the default case is parenthesis-quote. If the parenthesis-quote sequence has to appear in the string somewhere, you can easily specify custom terminators too, look up C++ raw literals to find details on doing that (it\'s easy).
