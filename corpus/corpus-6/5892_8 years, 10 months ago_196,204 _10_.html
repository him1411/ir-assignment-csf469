I would like to use Linq to query a bus schedule in my project, so that at any time I can get the next 5 bus arrival times. How can I limit my query to the first 5 results?More generally, how can I take a slice of a list in C#? (In Python I would use mylist[:5] to get the first 5 elements.)Or to slice:And of course often it\'s convenient to get the first five items according to some kind of order:In case anyone is interested (even if the question does not ask for this version), in C# 2 would be: (I have edited the answer, following some suggestions)To take first 5 elements better use expression like this one:var firstFiveArrivals = myList.Where([EXPRESSION]).Take(5);or var firstFiveArrivals = myList.Where([EXPRESSION]).Take(5).OrderBy([ORDER EXPR]);It will be faster than orderBy variant, because LINQ engine will not scan trough all list due to delayed execution, and will not sort all array.
