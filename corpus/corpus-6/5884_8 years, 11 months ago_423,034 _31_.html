How can I construct the following string in an Excel formula:Maurice "The Rocket" RichardIf I\'m using single quotes, it\'s trivial = "Maurice \'The Rocket\' Richard" but what about double quotes?Have you tried escaping with a double-quote?Alternatively, you can use the CHAR function:Three double quotes: " " " x " " " = "x" Excel will auto change to one double quote. e.g.:  = "x" hiI use a function for this (if the workbook already has VBA).This is from Sue Mosher\'s book "Microsoft Outlook Programming". Then your formula would be:="Maurice "&Quote("Rocket")&" Richard"This is similar to what Dave DuPlantis posted.In the event that you need to do this with JSON:will this work for macros using .Formula = "=THEFORMULAFUNCTION("STUFF")"\nso it would be like:\nwill this work for macros using .Formula = "=THEFORMULAFUNCTION(CHAR(34) & STUFF & CHAR(34))"Use  chr(34)\nCode:\n    Joe = "Hi there, " & Chr(34) & "Joe" & Chr(34)\n    ActiveCell.Value = JoeResult:\n    Hi there, "joe"Returning an empty or zero-length string (e.g. "") to make a cell appear blank is a common practise in a worksheet formula but recreating that option when inserting the formula through the Range.Formula or Range.FormulaR1C1 property in VBA is unwieldy due to the necessity of having to double-up the double-quote characters within a quoted string.The worksheet\'s native TEXT function can produce the same result without using quotes.To my eye, using TEXT(,) in place of "" cleans up even a simple formula like the one above. The benefits become increasingly significant when used in more complicated formulas like the practise of appending an empty string to a VLOOKUP to avoid returning a zero to the cell when a lookup results in a blank or returning an empty string on no-match with IFERROR.With TEXT(,) replacing the old "" method of delivering an empty string, you might get to stop using an abacus to determine whether you have the right number of quote characters in a formula string.VBA Function1)  .Formula = "=""THEFORMULAFUNCTION ""&(CHAR(34) & ""STUFF"" & CHAR(34))"2)  .Formula = "THEFORMULAFUNCTION ""STUFF"""The first method uses vba to write a formula in a cell which results in the calculated value:The second method uses vba to write a string in a cell which results in the value:Excel Result/Formula1) ="THEFORMULAFUNCTION "&(CHAR(34) & "STUFF" & CHAR(34))2) THEFORMULAFUNCTION "STUFF"There is another way, though more for " How can I construct the following string in an Excel formula: "Maurice "The Rocket" Richard" " than " How to create strings containing double quotes in Excel formulas? ", which is simply to use two single quotes:On the left is Calibri snipped from an Excel worksheet and on the right a snip from a VBA window.\nIn my view escaping as mentioned by @YonahW wins \'hands down\' but two single quotes is no more typing than two doubles and the difference is reasonably apparent in VBA without additional keystrokes while, potentially, not noticeable in a spreadsheet.Concatenate " as a ceparate cell:
