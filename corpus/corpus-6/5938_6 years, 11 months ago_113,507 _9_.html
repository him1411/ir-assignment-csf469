I\'m switching over from Eclipse to IntelliJ. In Eclipse, if you do Ctrl+O in the editor, it will show a hover popup that allows you to search for a method in the class you\'re editing.What is the equivalent shortcut for that in IntelliJ?Use View | File Structure Popup (Ctrl+F12 on Windows, \xe2\x8c\x98+F12 on OS X). Start typing method/symbol name to either narrow down the list or highlight the desired element. Press Enter to navigate to the selected element.I prefer to use the Structure view.  To open it, use the menu: View/Tools Window/Structure.  The hotkey on Windows is Alt+7Do Cmd+F12+Fn Key on mac in IntelliJ if clicking Cmd+F12 starts.If you are running on Linux (I tested in Ubuntu 10.04), the shortcut is Ctrl + F12 (same of Windows)You can type "this." and wait a second, a popup with methods and properties will display.Not a shortcut, but it works for me.PS: if you are in a static method, type the class name.
