I\'m implementing pagination, and it needs to be centered. The problem is that the links need to be displayed as block, so they need to be floated. But then, text-align: center; doesn\'t work on them. I could achieve it by giving the wrapper div padding of left, but every page will have a different number of pages, so that wouldn\'t work. Here\'s my code:To get the idea, what I want:Removing floats, and using inline-block may fix your problems:(remove the lines starting with - and add the lines starting with +.)inline-block works cross-browser, even on IE6 as long as the element is originally an inline element.Quote from quirksmode: An inline block is placed inline (ie. on the same line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block.this often can effectively replace floats: The real use of this value is when you want to give an inline element a width. In some circumstances some browsers don\'t allow a width on a real inline element, but if you switch to display: inline-block you are allowed to set a width.\xe2\x80\x9d ( http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html#inlineblock ).From the W3C spec:[inline-block] causes an element to generate an inline-level block container. The inside of an  inline-block is formatted as a block box, and the element itself is formatted as an atomic inline-level box.Since many years I use an old trick I learned in some blog, I\'m sorry i don\'t remember the name to give him credits.Anyway to center floating elements this should work:You need a structure like this:the trick is giving float left to make the containers change the width depending on the content. Than is a matter of position:relative and left 50% and -50% on the two containers.The good thing is that this is cross browser and should work from IE7+.Centering floats is easy. Just use the style for container:change the margin for floating elements:orand leave the rest as it is.It\'s the best solution for me to display things like menus or pagination.Strengths:cross-browser for any elements (blocks, list-items etc.)simplicity Weaknesses:@arnaud576875 Using inline-block elements will work great (cross-browser) in this case as pagination contains just anchors (inline), no list-items or divs:Strengths:Weknesses:gaps between inline-block elements - it works the same way as a space between words. It may cause some troubles calculating the width of the container and styling margins. Gaps width isn\'t constant but it\'s browser specific (4-5px).\nTo get rid of this gaps I would add to arnaud576875 code (not fully tested):.pagination{ word-spacing: -1em; }.pagination a{ word-spacing: .1em; }it won\'t work in IE6/7 on block and list-items elementsSet your container\'s width in px and add: Reference.Using FlexIE7 doesn\'t know inline-block.\nYou must add:I think the best way is using margin instead of display.I.e.:Check the result and the code:http://cssdeck.com/labs/d9d6ydifAdd this to you styling*If your container width is 50px put 25px, if it is 10em put 5em.Just addinginto my css menu of did the centering trick too
