Is it possible to set the size of a checkbox using CSS or HTML? width and size work under IE6+ but not with Firefox, where the checkbox stays 16x16 even if I set a smaller size.It\'s a little ugly (due to the scaling up), but it works on most newer browsers:Working solution for all modern browsers.Compatibility:Appearance:An easy solution is use the property zoom:Preview:     http://jsfiddle.net/h4qka9td/2017 version: https://jsfiddle.net/ksvx2txb/11/About: browser will use css zoom function if it is supported, if not, will use transform: scale.Why just don\'t use transform?

Instead of trying to manipulate the checkbox control, you could always build your own implementation using images, javascript, and hidden input fields. I\'m assuming this is similar to what niceforms is (from Staicu lonut\'s answer above), but wouldn\'t be particularly difficult to implement. I believe jQuery has a plugin to allow for this custom behavior as well (will look for the link and post here if I can find it).The other answers showed a pixelated checkbox, while I wanted something beautiful.\nThe result looks like this:\nEven though this version is more complicated I think it\'s worth giving it a try.HTMLSCSSJsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/asbd4hpr/The problem is Firefox doesn\'t listen to width and height.
