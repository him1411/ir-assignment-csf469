So I have an ng-repeat nested within another ng-repeat in order to build a nav menu. On each <li> on the inner ng-repeat loop I set an ng-click which calls the relevant controller for that menu item by passing in the $index to let the app know which one we need. However I need to also pass in the $index from the outer ng-repeat so the app knows which section we are in as well as which tutorial.here\'s a Plunker http://plnkr.co/edit/bJUhI9oGEQIql9tahIJN?p=previewEach ng-repeat creates a child scope with the passed data, and also adds an additional $index variable in that scope.So what you need to do is reach up to the parent scope, and use that $index.See http://plnkr.co/edit/FvVhirpoOF8TYnIVygE6?p=previewWay more elegant solution than $parent.$index is using ng-init:Plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/knwGEnOsAWLhLieKVItS?p=infoWhat about using this syntax (give a look in this plunker). I just discovered this and it\'s pretty awesome.Exemple :With this syntax you can give your own name to $index and differentiate the two indexes.Just to help someone who get here... You should not use $parent.$index as it\'s not really safe. If you add an ng-if inside the loop, you get the $index messed!Right wayCheck: plnkr.co/52oIhLfeXXI9ZAynTuAJ When you are dealing with objects, you want to ignore simple id\'s as much as convenient.If you change the click line to this, I think you will be well on your way:Also, I think you may need to changeto something likeSee http://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq and look for ng-class.I am trying to use the solution that gonzalon proposed. But it does not work in my case.\nI want to have a tooltip with more information when the mouse is over the cell of the table that i create by looping to the rows and cells.The values change when in move my mouse over the table cells, but the values for row and column are always both the column number.
