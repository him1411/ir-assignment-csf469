What is the difference between: npm install [package_name] --saveand npm install [package_name] --save-devWhat does this mean?The difference between --save and --save-dev may not be immediately noticable if you have tried them both on your own projects. So here are a few examples...Lets say you were bulding an app that that used the moment package to parse and display dates. Your app is a scheduler so it really needs this package to run, as in: cannot run without it. In this case you would useThis would create a new value in your package.jsonWhen you are developing, it really helps to use tools such as test suites and may need jasmine-core and karma. In this case you would useThis would also create a new value in your package.jsonYou do not need the test suite to run the app in its normal state, so it is a --save-dev type dependency, nothing more. You can see how if you do not understand what is really happening, it is a bit hard to imagine.Taken directly from NPM docs docs#dependenciesDependenciesDependencies are specified in a simple object that maps a package name\n  to a version range. The version range is a string which has one or\n  more space-separated descriptors. Dependencies can also be identified\n  with a tarball or git URL.Please do not put test harnesses or transpilers in your dependencies\n  object. See devDependencies, below.Even in the docs, it asks you to use --save-dev for modules such as test harnesses. I hope this helps and is clear.As suggested by @andreas-hultgren in this answer and according to the npm docs:If someone is planning on downloading and using your module in their program, then they probably don\'t want or need to download and build the external test or documentation framework that you use.However, for webapp development, Yeoman (a scaffolding tool that installs a peer-reviewed, pre-written package.json file amongst other things) places all packages in devDependencies and nothing in dependencies, so it appears that the use of --save-dev is a safe bet in webapp development, at least.By default, NPM simply installs a package under node_modules. When you\'re trying to install dependencies for your app/module, you would need to first install them, and then add them to the dependencies section of your package.json.--save-dev adds the third-party package to the package\'s development dependencies. It won\'t be installed when someone installs your package. It\'s typically only installed if someone clones your source repository and runs npm install in it.--save adds the third-party package to the package\'s dependencies. It will be installed together with the package whenever someone runs npm install package.Dev dependencies are those dependencies that are only needed for developing the package. That can include test runners, compilers, packagers, etc.\nBoth types of dependencies are stored in the package\'s package.json file. --save adds to dependencies, --save-dev adds to devDependenciesnpm install documentation can be referred here.--save-dev saves semver spec into "devDependencies" array in your package descriptor file, --save saves it into "dependencies" instead.A perfect example of this is:In this case, you\'d want to have Typescript (a javascript-parseable coding language) available for development, but once the app is deployed, it is no longer necessary, as all of the code has been transpiled to javascript. As such, it would make no sense to include it in the published app. Indeed, it would only take up space and increase download times.
