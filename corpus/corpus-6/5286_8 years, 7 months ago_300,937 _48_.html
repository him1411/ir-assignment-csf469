Is there any class, library or some piece of code which will help me to upload files with HTTPWebrequest? Edit 2:I do not want to upload to a WebDAV folder or something like that. I want to simulate a browser, so just like you upload your avatar to a forum or upload a file via form in a web application. Upload to a form which uses a multipart/form-data. Edit:WebClient is not cover my requirements, so I\'m looking for a solution with HTTPWebrequest.Took the code above and fixed because it throws Internal Server Error 500. There are some problems with \\r\\n badly positioned and spaces etc. Applied the refactoring with memory stream, writing directly to the request stream. Here is the result:and sample usage:It could be extended to handle multiple files or just call it multiple times for each file. However it suits your needs.I was looking for something like this, Found in : \nhttp://bytes.com/groups/net-c/268661-how-upload-file-via-c-code (modified for correctness):UPDATE: Using .NET 4.5 (or .NET 4.0 by adding the Microsoft.Net.Http package from NuGet) this is possible without external code, extensions, and "low level" HTTP manipulation. Here is an example:My ASP.NET Upload FAQ has an article on this, with example code: Upload files using an RFC 1867 POST request with HttpWebRequest/WebClient. This code doesn\'t load files into memory (as opposed to the code above), supports multiple files, and supports form values, setting credentials and cookies, etc.Edit: looks like Axosoft took down the page. Thanks guys.It\'s still accessible via archive.org.Based on the code provided above I added support for multiple files and also uploading a stream directly without the need to have a local file.To upload files to a specific url including some post params do the following:To enhance this even more one could determine the name and mime type from the given file itself.something like this is close:  (untested code)Took the above and modified it accept some header values, and multiple filesI think you\'re looking for something more like WebClient.Specifically, UploadFile().VB Example (converted from C# example on another post):I had to deal with this recently - another way to approach it is to use the fact that WebClient is inheritable, and change the underlying WebRequest from there:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient.getwebrequest(VS.80).aspxI prefer C#, but if you\'re stuck with VB the results will look something like this:There is another working example with some my comments :And there is example of using : I was looking to do file upload and add some parameters to a multipart/form-data request in VB.NET and not through a regular forms post.\nThanks to @JoshCodes answer I got the direction I was looking for.\nI am posting my solution to help others find a way to perform a post with both file and parameters\nthe html equivalent of what I try to achieve is :\nhtmlDue to the fact that I have to provide the apiKey and the signature (which is a calculated checksum of the request parameters and api key concatenated string), I needed to do it server side.\nThe other reason I needed to do it server side is the fact that the post of the file can be performed at any time by pointing to a file already on the server (providing the path), so there would be no manually selected file during form post thus form data file would not contain the file stream.Otherwise I could have calculated the checksum via an ajax callback and submitted the file through the html post using JQuery.\nI am using .net version 4.0 and cannot upgrade to 4.5 in the actual solution. So I had to install the Microsoft.Net.Http using nuget cmd Not sure if this was posted before but I got this working with WebClient. i read the documentation for the WebClient. A key point they make isIf the BaseAddress property is not an empty string ("") and address\n  does not contain an absolute URI, address must be a relative URI that\n  is combined with BaseAddress to form the absolute URI of the requested\n  data. If the QueryString property is not an empty string, it is\n  appended to address.So all I did was wc.QueryString.Add("source", generatedImage) to add the different query parameters and somehow it matches the property name with the image I uploaded. Hope it helpsModified @CristianRomanescu code to work with memory stream, accept file as a byte array, allow null nvc, return request response and work with Authorization-header. Tested the code with Web Api 2.Testcode:I can never get the examples to work properly, I always receive a 500 error when sending it to the server.However I came across a very elegant method of doing it in this urlIt is easily extendible and obviously works with binary files as well as XML.You call it using something similar to thisFor me, the following works (mostly inspirated from all of the following answers), I started from Elad\'s answer and modify/simplify things to match my need (remove not file form inputs, only one file, ...).Hope it can helps somebody :)(PS: I know that exception handling is not implemented and it assumes that it was written inside a class, so I may need some integration effort...)Check out the MyToolkit library: http://mytoolkit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=HttpClient use convert File to ToBase64String, after use Xml to promulgate\nto Server call, this server use File.WriteAllBytes(path,Convert.FromBase64String(dataFile_Client_sent)).Good lucky!I realize this is probably really late, but I was searching for the same solution.  I found the following response from a Microsoft repI wrote a class using WebClient way back when to do multipart form upload.http://ferozedaud.blogspot.com/2010/03/multipart-form-upload-helper.htmlThis will work with all versions of the .NET framework.
