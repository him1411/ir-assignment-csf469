How can I set a border for an ImageView and change its color in Android?I set the below xml to the background of the Image View as Drawable. It works.And then add android:background="@drawable/yourXmlFileName" to your ImageViewFollowing is the code that i used to have black border. Note that i have not used extra xml file for border.This is an old post I know, but I thought this might possibly help someone out there.If you want to simulate a translucent border that doesn\'t overlap the shape\'s "solid" color, then use this in your xml. Note that I don\'t use the "stroke" tag here at all as it seems to always overlap the actual drawn shape.ImageView in xml filesave below code with the name of border_image.xml and it should be in drawable folderif you want to give rounded corner to the border of image then you may change a line in border.xml fileThis has been used above but not mentioned exclusively.This will make the ImageView source to fit within the padding\'s added to its background.Via XML it can be donw as below,Add a background Drawable like res/drawables/background.xml:Update the ImageView background in res/layout/foo.xml:Exclude the ImageView padding if you want the src to draw over the background.I found it so much easier to do this:1) Edit the frame to have the content inside (with 9patch tool).2) Place the ImageView inside a Linearlayout, and set the frame background or colour you want as the background of the Linearlayout. As you set the frame to have the content inside itself, your ImageView will be inside the frame (right where you set the content with the 9patch tool).you must create a background.xml in res/drawable this codeIn the same xml I have used next:Following is my simplest solution to this lengthy trouble.In the following answer I\'ve explained it well enough, please have a look at that too!I hope this will be helpful to someone else out there!
