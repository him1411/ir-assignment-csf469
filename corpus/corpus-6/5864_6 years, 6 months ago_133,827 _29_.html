Is there anyway of getting rounded corners on the outline of a div element, similar to border-radius?Old question now, but this might be relevant for somebody with a similar issue. I had an input field with rounded border and wanted to change colour of focus outline. I couldn\'t tame the horrid square outline to the input control.So instead, I used box-shadow. I actually preferred the smooth look of the shadow, but the shadow can be hardened to simulate a rounded outline:I usually accomplish this using the :after pseudo-element:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/6QUhf/of course it depends on usage, this method allows control over individual borders, rather than using the hard shadow method. you could also set -1px offsets and use a background linear gradient (no border) for a different effect once again.Similar to Lea Hayes above, but here\'s how I did it:No nesting of DIVs or jQuery necessary, Altho for brevity I have left out the -moz and -webkit variants of some of the CSS. You can see the result at http://jsfiddle.net/Zq8XU/You\'re looking for something like this, I think.There is a Firefox-only -moz-outline-radius properly, but that won\'t work on IE/Chrome/Safari/Opera/etc. So, it looks like the most cross-browser-compatible way* to get a curved line around a border is to use a wrapper div:Demo 2*aside from using imagesI know what he means...If you want to get an embossed look you could do something like the following:http://jsfiddle.net/xxCT8/he is looking for a way to have this work in other browsers.. no work-around that I have found but does anyone else have anything?EDIT: The only other way you can do this is to use box-shadow, but then this wont work if you already have a box shadow on that element.I wanted some nice focus accessibility for dropdown menus in a Bootstrap navbar, and was pretty happy with this:I just found a great solution for this, and after looking at all the responses so far, I haven\'t seen it posted yet.  So, here\'s what I did:I created a CSS Rule for the class and used a pseudo-class of :focus for that rule.  I set "outline: none" to get rid of that default light-blue non-border-radius-able \'outline\' that Chrome uses by default.  Then, in that same :focus pseudo-class, where that outline no longer exists, I added "border-radius: 5px" and "border: 2px solid maroon" to have a maroon-colored outline with a border radius that now appears when the element is tab-selected by the user.There is the solution if you need only outline without border. It\'s not mine. I got if from Bootstrap css file. If you specify outline: 1px auto certain_color, you\'ll get thin outer line around div of certain color. In this case the specified width has no matter, even if you specify 10 px width, anyway it will be thin line. The key word in mentioned rule is "auto".\nIf you need outline with rounded corners and certain width, you may add css rule on border with needed width and same color. It makes outline thicker.  No. Borders sit on the outside of the element and on the inside of the box-model margin area. Outlines sit on the inside of the element and the box-model padding area ignores it. It isn\'t intended for aesthetics. It\'s just to show the designer the outlines of the elements. In the early stages of developing an html document for example, a developer might need to quickly discern if they have put all of the skeletal divs in the correct place. Later on they may need to check if various buttons and forms are the correct number of pixels apart from each other.Borders are aesthetic in nature. Unlike outlines they are actually apart of the box-model, which means they do not overlap text set to margin: 0; and each side of the border can be styled individually.If you\'re trying to apply a corner radius to outline I assume you are using it the way most people use border. So if you don\'t mind me asking, what property of outline makes it desirable over border?I just set outline transparent.}}Try using padding and a background color for the border, then a border for the outline:Worked in my case.
