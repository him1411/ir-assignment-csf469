In R, mean() and median() are standard functions which do what you\'d expect.  mode() tells you the internal storage mode of the object, not the value that occurs the most in its argument. But is there is a standard library function that implements the statistical mode for a vector (or list)?One more solution, which works for both numeric & character/factor data:On my dinky little machine, that can generate & find the mode of a 10M-integer vector in about half a second.There is package modeest which provide estimators of the mode of univariate unimodal (and sometimes multimodal) data and values of the modes of usual probability distributions.For more information see this pagefound this on the r mailing list, hope it\'s helpful. It is also what I was thinking anyways. You\'ll want to table() the data, sort and then pick the first name. It\'s hackish but should work.I found Ken Williams post above to be great, I added a few lines to account for NA values and made it a function for ease. A quick and dirty way of estimating the mode of a vector of numbers you believe come from a continous univariate distribution (e.g. a normal distribution) is defining and using the following function:Then to get the mode estimate:The following function comes in three forms:method = "mode" [default]:  calculates the mode for a unimodal vector, else returns an NA\nmethod = "nmodes":  calculates the number of modes in the vector\nmethod = "modes":  lists all the modes for a unimodal or polymodal vectorHere, another solution:I can\'t vote yet but Rasmus B\xc3\xa5\xc3\xa5th\'s answer is what I was looking for. \nHowever, I would modify it a bit allowing to contrain the distribution for example fro values only between 0 and 1. We aware that you may not want to constrain at all your distribution, then set from=-"BIG NUMBER", to="BIG NUMBER"I\'ve written the following code in order to generate the mode.Let\'s try it:Based on @Chris\'s function to calculate the mode or related metrics, however using Ken Williams\'s method to calculate frequencies. This one provides a fix for the case of no modes at all (all elements equally frequent), and some more readable method names. Since it uses Ken\'s method to calculate frequencies the performance is also optimised, using AkselA\'s post I benchmarked some of the previous answers as to show how my function is close to Ken\'s in performance, with the conditionals for the various ouput options causing only minor overhead:\nThis hack should work fine. Gives you the value as well as the count of mode: Here is a function to find the mode:R has so many add-on packages that some of them may well provide the [statistical] mode of a numeric list/series/vector.However the standard library of R itself doesn\'t seem to have such a built-in method!  One way to work around this is to use some construct like the following (and to turn this to a function if you use often...):For bigger sample list, one should consider using a temporary variable for the max(tabSmpl) value  (I don\'t know that R would automatically optimize this)Reference: see "How about median and mode?" in this KickStarting R lesson\nThis seems to confirm that (at least as of the writing of this lesson) there isn\'t a mode function in R  (well...  mode() as you found out is used for asserting the type of variables).This works pretty fineWhile I like Ken Williams simple function, I would like to retrieve the multiple modes if they exist.  With that in mind, I use the following function which returns a list of the modes if multiple or the single.I was looking through all these options and started to wonder about their relative features and performances, so I did some tests. In case anyone else are curious about the same, I\'m sharing my results here.Not wanting to bother about all the functions posted here, I chose to focus on a sample based on a few criteria: the function should work on both character, factor, logical and numeric vectors, it should deal with NAs and other problematic values appropriately, and output should be \'sensible\', i.e. no numerics as character or other such silliness.I also added a function of my own, which is based on the same rle idea as chrispy\'s, except adapted for more general use:I ended up running five functions, on two sets of test data, through microbenchmark. The function names refer to their respective authors:Chris\' function was set to method="modes" and na.rm=TRUE by default to make it more comparable, but other than that the functions were used as presented here by their authors.In matter of speed alone Kens version wins handily, but it is also the only one of these that will only report one mode, no matter how many there really are. As is often the case, there\'s a trade-off between speed and versatility. In method="mode", Chris\' version will return a value iff there is one mode, else NA. I think that\'s a nice touch.\nI also think it\'s interesting how some of the functions are affected by an increased number of unique values, while others aren\'t nearly as much. I haven\'t studied the code in detail to figure out why that is, apart from eliminating logical/numeric as a the cause.Another simple option that gives all values ordered by frequency is to use rle:I would use the density() function to identify a smoothed maximum of a (possibly continuous) distribution :where x is the data collection. Pay attention to the adjust paremeter of the density function which regulate the smoothing.Another possible solution:Usage:Output:A small modification to Ken Williams\' answer, adding optional params na.rm and return_multiple.Unlike the answers relying on names(), this answer maintains the data type of x in the returned value(s).To show it works with the optional params and maintains data type:Thanks to @Frank for simplification.Sorry, I might take it too simple, but doesn\'t this do the job? (in 1.3 secs for 1E6 values on my machine):You just have to replace the "round(rnorm(1e6),2)" with your vector.You could also calculate the number of times an instance has happened in your set and find the max number. e.g.Could try the following function:Calculating Mode is mostly in case of factor variable then we can use HouseVotes84 is dataset available in \'mlbench\' package.it will give max label value. it is easier to use by inbuilt functions itself without writing function.Below is the code which can be use to find the mode of a vector variable in R.An easy way to calculate MODE of a vector \'v\' containing discrete values is:
