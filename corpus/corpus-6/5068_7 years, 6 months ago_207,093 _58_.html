How does this actually come about?I am working in one repo by myself at the moment, so this is my workflow:Then when I do a git status it tells me that my branch is ahead by X commits (presumably the same number of commits that I have made). Is it because when you push the code it doesn\'t actually update your locally cached files (in the .git folders)? git pull seems to \'fix\' this strange message, but I am still curious why it happens, maybe I am using git wrong?including what branch is printed in the messageMy local branch is ahead of masterwhere do you push/pull the current branchI am pushing to github and pulling to whichever computer I happen to be working on at that point in time, my local copy is always fully up to date as I am the only one working on it.it doesn\'t actually check the remote repoThat is what I thought, I figured that I would make sure my understanding of it was correct.are you passing some extra arguments to it?Not ones that I can see, maybe there is some funny config going on on my end?If you get this message after doing a git pull remote branch, try following it up with a git fetch. (Optionally, run git fetch -p to prune deleted branches from the repo)Fetch seems to update the local representation of the remote branch, which doesn\'t necessarily happen when you do a git pull remote branch.UseThe --rebase option means that git will move your local commit aside, synchronise with the remote and then try to apply your commits from the new state.I think you\xe2\x80\x99re misreading the message \xe2\x80\x94 your branch isn\xe2\x80\x99t ahead of master, it is master. It\xe2\x80\x99s ahead of origin/master, which is a remote tracking branch that records the status of the remote repository from your last push, pull, or fetch. It\xe2\x80\x99s telling you exactly what you did; you got ahead of the remote and it\xe2\x80\x99s reminding you to push.Someone said you might be misreading your message, you aren\'t. This issue actually has to do with your <project>/.git/config file. In it will be a section similar to this:If you remove the fetch line from your project\'s .git/config file you\'ll stop the "Your branch is ahead of \'origin/master\' by N commits." annoyance from occurring.Or so I hope. :)Step 1 : git checkout <branch_name>Step 2  : git pull -s recursive -X theirsStep 3  : git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>More details : https://stackoverflow.com/a/39698570/2439715Enjoy.I had this same problem on a Windows machine. When I ran a git pull origin master command, I would get the "ahead of \'origin/master\' by X commits" warning. I found that if I instead ran git pull origin and did NOT specify the branch, then I would no longer receive the warning. It just reminds you the differences between the current branch and the branch which does the current track. Please provide more info, including what branch is printed in the message and where do you push/pull the current branch.Though this question is a bit old...I was in a similar situation and my answer here helped me fix a similar issue I hadFirst try with push -f or force optionIf that did not work it is possible that (as in my case) the remote repositories (or rather the references to remote repositories that show up on git remote -v) might not be getting updated.Outcome of above being your push synced your local/branch with your remote/branch however, the cache in your local repo still shows previous commit (of local/branch ...provided only single commit was pushed) as HEAD.To confirm the above clone the repo at a different location and try to compare local/branch HEAD and remote/branch HEAD. If they both are same then you are probably facing the issue I did. Solution:Now do a push -f as followsgit push -f github master ### Note your command does not have origin anymore!Do a git pull now\n git pull github masteron git status receive# On branch masternothing to commit (working directory clean)I hope this useful for someone as the number of views is so high that searching for this error almost always lists this thread on the topAlso refer gitref for detailsIn my case it was because I switched to master using Just to pull the new version of it instead ofThe first command resets the head of master to my latest commitsI used To fix thatI actually had this happening when I was doing a switch/checkout with TortiseGIT.My problem was that I had created the branch based on another local branch. It created a "merge" entry in /.git/config that looked something like this:Where whenever I switched to the "web" branch, it was telling me I was 100+ commits ahead of develop. Well, I was no longer committing to develop so that was true. I was able to simply remove this entry and it seems to be functioning as expected. It is properly tracking with the remote ref instead of complaining about being behind the develop branch.As Vikram said, this Stack Overflow thread is the top result in Google when searching for this problem so I thought I\'d share my situation and solution.The answers that suggest git pull or git fetch are correct.\nThe message is generated when git status sees a difference between .git/FETCH_HEAD and .git/refs/remotes/<repository>/<branch> (e.g. .git/refs/remotes/origin/master).  The latter file records the HEAD from the last fetch (for the repository/branch).  Doing git fetch updates both files to the branch\'s current HEAD.\nOf course if there is nothing to fetch (because the local repository is already up-to-date) then .git/FETCH_HEAD doesn\'t change.I went through every solution on this page, and fortunately @anatolii-pazhyn commented because his solution was the one that worked. Unfortunately I don\'t have enough reputation to upvote him, but I recommend trying his solution first:Which gave me:I also recommend:You can also use:Best of luckI had this issue on my stage server where I do only pulls.\nAnd hard reset helped me to clean HEAD to the same as remote.So now I have again:
