Could someone explain to me simply the easiest way to change the indentation behavior of vim based on the file type? For instance if I open a python file it would indent with 2 spaces, but if I open powershell it would use 4 spaces.You can add .vim files to be executed whenever vim switches to a particular filetype.For example, I have a file ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/html.vim  with this contents:Which causes vim to use tabs with a width of 2 characters for indenting (the noexpandtab option is set globally elsewhere in my configuration).This is described here: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_05.html#05.4, scroll down to the section on filetype plugins.Use ftplugins or autocommands to set options. (:h ftplugin for more information)In ~/.vim/ftplugin/python.vim:And don\'t forget to turn them on in ~/.vimrcOr in ~/.vimrcI would also suggest learning the difference between \'ts\' and \'sts\'.  A lot of people don\'t know about \'sts\'.Put autocmd commands based on the file suffix in your ~/.vimrcThe commands you\'re looking for are probably ts= and sw=edit your ~/.vimrc, and add different file types for different indents,e.g. I want html/rb indent for 2 spaces, and js/coffee files indent for 4 spaces:refer to: Setting Vim whitespace preferences by filetypeI usually work with expandtab set, but that\'s bad for makefiles.  I recently added:to the end of my .vimrc file and it recognizes Makefile, makefile, and *.mk as makefiles and does not expand tabs.  Presumably, you can extend this.I\'m always amazed by people who change the size of tabs for different filetypes. What on earth do you do when you look at a file using less?Personally, I use these settings in .vimrc:This might be known by most of us, but anyway (I was puzzled my first time): \nDoing :set et (:set expandtabs) does not change the tabs already existing in the file, one has to do :retab. \nFor example:and the tabs in the file are replaced by enough spaces. To have tabs back simply do:While you can configure Vim\'s indentation just fine using the indent plugin or manually using the settings, I recommend using a python script called Vindect that automatically sets the relevant settings for you when you open a python file. Use this tip to make using Vindect even more effective. When I first started editing python files created by others with various indentation styles (tab vs space and number of spaces), it was incredibly frustrating. But Vindect along with this indent file Also recommend:Today, you could try editorconfig, there is also a vim plugin for it. With this, you are able not only change indentation size in vim, but in many other editors, keep consistent coding styles.Below is a simple editorconfig, as you can see, the python files will have 4 spaces for indentation, and pug template files will only have 2. I use a utility that I wrote in C called autotab. It analyzes the first few thousand lines of a file which you load and determines values for the Vim parameters shiftwidth, tabstop and expandtab.This is compiled using, for instance, gcc -O autotab.c -o autotab. Instructions for integrating with Vim are in the comment header at the top.Autotab is fairly clever, but can get confused from time to time, in particular by that have been inconsistently maintained using different indentation styles.If a file evidently uses tabs, or a combination of tabs and spaces, for indentation, Autotab will figure out what tab size is being used by considering factors like alignment of internal elements across successive lines, such as comments. It works for a variety of programming languages, and is forgiving for "out of band" elements which do not obey indentation increments, such as C preprocessing directives, C statement labels, not to mention the obvious blank lines.
