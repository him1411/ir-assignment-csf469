My application is to be deployed on both tcServer and WebSphere 6.1. This application uses ehCache and so requires slf4j as a dependency.\nAs a result I\'ve added the slf4j-api.jar (1.6) jar to my war file bundle.The application works fine in tcServer except for the following error:However, when I deploy in WebSphere I get a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder.I\'ve checked the classpaths of both application servers and there is no other slf4j jar.Does anyone have any ideas what may be happening here?I had the same issue with WebSphere 6.1. As Ceki pointed out, there were tons of jars that WebSphere was using and one of them was pointing to an older version of slf4j. The No-Op rollback happens only with slf4j -1.6+ so anything older than that will throw an exception and halts your deployment.There is a documentation in SLf4J site which resolves this. I followed that and added slf4j-simple-1.6.1.jar to my application along with slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar which I already had. This solved my issue. Hope it helps others who have this issue.This is for those who came here from google search.If you use maven just add the followingOr You need to add following jar file in your classpath: slf4j-simple-1.6.2.jar. If you don\'t have it, please download it. Please refer to http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindingsput file slf4j-log4j12-1.6.4.jar in the classpath will do the trick. If you are using maven to dependency management so you can just add following dependency in pom.xmlFor non-Maven users\nJust download the library and put it into your project classpath.Here you can see details: http://www.mkyong.com/wicket/java-lang-classnotfoundexception-org-slf4j-impl-staticloggerbinder/Simply add this to your pom.xml:SLF4j is an abstraction for various logging frameworks. Hence apart from having slf4j you need to include any of your logging framework like log4j or logback (etc) in your classpath. \nTo have an idea refer the First Baby Step in http://logback.qos.ch/manual/introduction.htmlI got into this issue when I get the following error:when I was using slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar in my libs.Inspite I tried with the whole suggested complement jars, like slf4j-log4j12-1.7.5.jar, slf4j-simple-1.7.5 the error message still persisted. The problem finally was solved when I added slf4j-jdk14-1.7.5.jar to the java libs. Get the whole slf4j package at http://www.slf4j.org/download.htmlSlf4j is a facade for the underlying logging frameworks like log4j, logback, java.util.logging.To connect with underlying frameworks, slf4j uses a binding. The above error is thrown if the binding jar is missed. You can download this jar and add it to classpath.For maven dependency,This dependency in addition to slf4j-log4j12-1.7.21.jar,it will pull slf4j-api-1.7.21.jar as well as log4j-1.2.17.jar into your projectReference: http://www.slf4j.org/manual.htmlIn the Websphere case, you have an older version of slf4j-api.jar, 1.4.x. or 1.5.x lying around somewhere. The behavior you observe on tcServer, that is fail-over to NOP, occurs on slf4j versions 1.6.0 and later. Make sure that you are using slf4j-api-1.6.x.jar on all platforms and that no older version of slf4j-api is placed on the class path.haha,sometime,we should see the note from the warning.for example. SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.. In the website, you can search the reasion why this warning happen.\nPlacing one (and only one) of slf4j-nop.jar slf4j-simple.jar, slf4j-log4j12.jar, slf4j-jdk14.jar or logback-classic.jar on the class path should solve the problem.\ncompile "org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.6.1"\ncompile "org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.6.1"\nadd the above code to your build.gradle or the corresponding code to pom.xml in maven projectPlease add the following dependencies to pom to resolve this issue.I am working in a project Struts2+Spring. So it need a dependency slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar.If I run the project, I am getting error likeFailed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder" I solved my problem by adding the slf4j-log4j12-1.7.5.jar.So add this jar in your project to solve the issue.I know this post is a little old, but in case anyone else runs into this problem:Add slf4j-jdk14-X.X.X.jar to your CLASSPATH (where X.X.X is the version number - e.g. slf4j-jdk14-1.7.5.jar).HTH\nPeterAccording to SLF4J official documentation Failed to load class org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinderThis warning message is reported when the\n  org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder class could not be loaded into\n  memory. This happens when no appropriate SLF4J binding could be found\n  on the class path. Placing one (and only one) of slf4j-nop.jar,\n  slf4j-simple.jar, slf4j-log4j12.jar, slf4j-jdk14.jar or\n  logback-classic.jar on the class path should solve the problem.Simply add this jar along with slf4j api.jar to your classpath to get things done.\nBest of luckI use Jena and I add the fellowing dependence to pom.xmlI try to add slf4j-simple but it just disappear the "SLF4J: Failed to load class \xe2\x80\x9corg.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder\xe2\x80\x9d" error but logback-classic show more detail infomation.The official documentI solve it adding this library: slf4j-simple-1.7.25.jar\nYou can download this in official web https://www.slf4j.org/download.htmlthe solution is indicated on their official website :Failed to load class org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinderThis warning message is reported when the\n  org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder class could not be loaded into\n  memory. This happens when no appropriate SLF4J binding could be found\n  on the class path. Placing one (and only one) of slf4j-nop.jar\n  slf4j-simple.jar, slf4j-log4j12.jar, slf4j-jdk14.jar or\n  logback-classic.jar on the class path should solve the problem. SINCE\n  1.6.0 As of SLF4J version 1.6, in the absence of a binding, SLF4J will default to a no-operation (NOP) logger implementation. If you are\n  responsible for packaging an application and do not care about\n  logging, then placing slf4j-nop.jar on the class path of your\n  application will get rid of this warning message. Note that embedded\n  components such as libraries or frameworks should not declare a\n  dependency on any SLF4J binding but only depend on slf4j-api. When a\n  library declares a compile-time dependency on a SLF4J binding, it\n  imposes that binding on the end-user, thus negating SLF4J\'s purpose.solution : I have added to my project using maven research on intellij and i have chosen the slf4j-jdk14.jar.
