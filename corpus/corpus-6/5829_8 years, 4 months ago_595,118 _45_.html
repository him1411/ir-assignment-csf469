I\'m trying to use GCC (linux) with a makefile to compile my project.I get the following error which is can\'t seem to decipher in this context:  This is the makefile:    That\'s usually because you don\'t have a file called vertex.cpp available to make. Check that:Other than that, I\'ve not much else to suggest. Perhaps you could give us a directory listing of that directory.In my experience, this error is frequently caused by a spelling error.I got this error today.make[1]: *** No rule to make target maintenaceDialog.cpp\', needed bymaintenaceDialog.o\'.  Stop.In my case the error was simply a spelling error.  The word MAINTENANCE was missing it\'s third N.  Also check the spelling on your filenames.The more common reason for this message to be printed is because you forgot to include the directory in which the source file resides. As a result, gcc "thinks" this file does not exist.You can add the directory using the -I argument to gcc.In my case I had bone-headedly used commas as separators. To use your example I did this:Changing it to the equivalent offixed it.Is that it exactly? Remember that Makefile syntax is whitespace aware and requires tabs to indent commands under actions.In my case it was due to a multi-line rule error in the Makefile. I had something like:The backslash at the end of file list in CONFIG_OBJ1\'s rule caused this error. It should be like:The problem I found was even sillier than what other folks have mentioned. Our makefiles get passed lists of things to build. Someone added TheOtherLibrary to one of the lists, as shown below.They should have done this:Had they done it the second way, they would not have wiped out the Library build. The plus in += is very important.If you are trying to build John the Ripper "bleeding-jumbo" and get an error like "make: *** No rule to make target \'linux-x86-64\'". Try running this command instead: ./configure && makeI got the same error when I only copy the Source directory to different location.It was solved after I moved the Build directory too.In my case, the source and/or old object file(s) were locked (read-only) by a semi-crashed IDE or from a backup cloud service that stopped working properly. Restarting all programs and services that were associated with the folder structure solved the problem.Another example of a weird problem and its solution:This:gives: make[3]: *** No rule to make target \'/usr/lib/libPocoFoundationd.so\', needed by \'../hello_poco/bin/mac/HelloPoco\'.  Stop.But if I remove Poco_LIBRARIES it works:I\'m using clang8 on Mac and clang 3.9 on Linux\nThe problem only occurs on Linux but works on Mac!I forgot to mention: Poco_LIBRARIES was wrong - it was not set by cmake/find_package!You example is quite straightforward but what may sometimes confuse are \nmessages of make itself. Lets consider an example.My folder contents is:Whereas my makefile looks likeAlthough I do have index.md where it should be and there is no mistake in the name of it, the message from make will beTo be honest the message is utterly wrong. Lets alter makefile a little, which is to say replace patterns with explicit rules:And now the message we get will be:Miracle! The following might be concluded:Messages of make depends on rules and does not always point to the root of problemsThere might be other problems in your makefile different from specified by this messageNow we\'ve come to a solution where we should check other dependencies in a rule as well:Only this will provide us with the desired result:I had this problem on a function that was removed.  I found references to the function in a couple of the metadata files in the WBworkspace69.metadata.plugins directory.  I deleted those metadata files and the problem went away.In my case, it was due to me calling the Makefile: MAKEFILE (all caps)
