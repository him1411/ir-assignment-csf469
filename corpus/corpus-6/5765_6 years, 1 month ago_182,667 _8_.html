Is it possible? When installing pip, install the python packages inside my $HOME folder. (for example, I want to install mercurial, using pip, but inside $HOME instead of /usr/local)I\'m with a mac machine and just thought about this possibility, instead of "polluting" my /usr/local, I would use my $HOME instead.PEP370 is exactly about this. Is just creating a \xcb\x9c/.local and do a pip install package enough to make these packages to be installed only at my $HOME folder?While you can use a virtualenv, you don\'t need to.  The trick is passing the PEP370 --user argument to the setup.py script.  With the latest version of pip, one way to do it is:This should result in the hg script being installed in $HOME/.local/bin/hg and the rest of the hg package in $HOME/.local/lib/pythonx.y/site-packages/.Note, that the above is true for Python 2.6.  There has been a bit of controversy among the Python core developers about what is the appropriate directory location on Mac OS X for PEP370-style user installations.  In Python 2.7 and 3.2, the location on Mac OS X was changed from $HOME/.local to $HOME/Library/Python.  This might change in a future release.  But, for now, on 2.7 (and 3.2, if hg were supported on Python 3), the above locations will be $HOME/Library/Python/x.y/bin/hg and $HOME/Library/Python/x.y/lib/python/site-packages.I would use virtualenv at your HOME directory.You could then also alter ~/.(login|profile|bash_profile), whichever is right for your shell to add ~/bin to your PATH and then that pip|python|easy_install would be the one used by default.
