Can Template Haskell find out the names and/or the declarations of the associated type synonyms declared in a type class?  I expected reify would do what I want, but it doesn\'t seem to provide all the necessary information.  It works for getting function type signatures:However, adding an associated type synonym to the class causes no change (up to renaming) in the output:If I know the name of F, I can look up information about it:But I can\'t find the name of F in the first place.  Even if I add an instance of the type class, the InstanceD has none of the information about the definition:If reify won\'t work, is there a workaround, other than listing the associate type synonyms manually?This problem is present in GHC 7.8.3 with version 2.9.0.0 of the template-haskell package; it was also present in GHC 7.4.2 with version 2.7.0.0 of the template-haskell package.  (I didn\'t check on GHC 7.6.*, but I imagine it was present there too.)  I\'m interested in solutions for any version of GHC (including "this was only fixed in GHC version V").It is not implemented because nobody requested it.The odd thing is that TH uses its own AST, which doesn\'t follow internal compiler\'s AST. As a result, any new feature (e.g. associated type families) is not automatically available via TH. Some one have to open a ticket and implement it.For the reference: internal reifyClass function ignores associated type families (it is the 5th element of the tuple returned by classExtraBigSig, see also definition of ClassATItem.)Technically it should be easy to implement associated type family support in reify, but most likely it will require backward incompatible changes in TH API, e.g. because its AST doesn\'t seem to support associated type defaults.Added: It is now implemented (without API change btw) and probably will be available in the next ghc release.
