I have an application with three tabs.Each tab has its own layout .xml file. The main.xml has its own map fragment. It\'s the one that shows up when the application first launches.Everything works fine except for when I change between tabs. If I try to switch back to the map fragment tab, I get this error. Switching to and between other tabs works just fine.What could be wrong here?This is my main class and my main.xml, as well as a relevant class that I use ( you will also find the error log at the bottom )main classmain.xmlrelevant class ( MapFragment.java )error The answer Matt suggests works, but it cause the map to be recreated and redrawn, which isn\'t always desirable.\nAfter lots of trial and error, I found a solution that works for me:For good measure, here\'s "map.xml" (R.layout.map) with R.id.mapFragment (android:id="@+id/mapFragment"):I hope this helps, but I can\'t guarantee that it doesn\'t have any adverse effects.Edit: There were some adverse effects, such as when exiting the application and starting it again. Since the application isn\'t necessarily completely shut down (but just put to sleep in the background), the previous code i submitted would fail upon restarting the application. I\'ve updated the code to something that works for me, both going in & out of the map and exiting and restarting the application, I\'m not too happy with the try-catch bit, but it seem to work well enough. When looking at the stack trace it occurred to me that I could just check if the map fragment is in the FragmentManager, no need for the try-catch block, code updated.More edits: Turns out you need that try-catch after all. Just checking for the map fragment turned out not to work so well after all. Blergh.The problem is that what you are trying to do shouldn\'t be done. You shouldn\'t be inflating fragments inside other fragments. From Android\'s documentation:Note: You cannot inflate a layout into a fragment when that layout\n  includes a <fragment>. Nested fragments are only supported when added\n  to a fragment dynamically.While you may be able to accomplish the task with the hacks presented here, I highly suggest you don\'t do it. Its impossible to be sure that these hacks will handle what each new Android OS does when you try to inflate a layout for a fragment containing another fragment. The only Android-supported way to add a fragment to another fragment is via a transaction from the child fragment manager.Simply change your XML layout into an empty container (add an ID if needed): Then in the Fragment onViewCreated(View view, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) method:I had the same issue and was able to resolve it by manually removing the MapFragment in the onDestroy() method of the Fragment class.  Here is code that works and references the MapFragment by ID in the XML:If you don\'t remove the MapFragment manually, it will hang around so that it doesn\'t cost a lot of resources to recreate/show the map view again. It seems that keeping the underlying MapView is great for switching back and forth between tabs, but when used in fragments this behavior causes a duplicate MapView to be created upon each new MapFragment with the same ID.  The solution is to manually remove the MapFragment and thus recreate the underlying map each time the fragment is inflated.I also noted this in another answer [1].This is my answer:1, Create a layout xml like following:2, in the Fragment class, add a google map programmatically.My solution:I would recommend replace() rather than attach()/detach() in your tab handling.Or, switch to ViewPager. Here is a sample project showing a ViewPager, with tabs, hosting 10 maps. For those who are still running into this issue, the best way to make sure you don\'t get this error with a Map in a Tab is to make the Fragment extend SupportMapFragment instead of nesting a SupportMapFragment inside the Fragment used for the Tab.I just got this working using a ViewPager with a FragmentPagerAdapter, with the SupportMapFragment in the third Tab.Here is the general structure, note there is no need to override the onCreateView() method, and there is no need to inflate any layout xml:Result:Here is the full class code that I used to test with, which includes the placeholder Fragment used for the first two Tabs, and the Map Fragment used for the third Tab:Another solution:That\'s it, if not null you don\'t need to reinitialize it removing from parent is unnecessary step.I have lost hours today to find the reason, fortunately this issue is not because of MapFragment implementation, fnfortunately, this does not work because nested fragments are only supported through support library from rev 11.My implementation has an activity with actionbar (in tabbed mode) with two tabs (no viewpager), one having the map and the other having a list of entries. Of course I\'ve been quite naive to use MapFragment inside my tab-fragments, et voila the app crashed everytime I switched back to map-tab.( The same issue I also would have in case my tab-fragment would inflate any layout containing any other fragment ).One option is to use the MapView (instead of MapFragment), with some overhead though ( see MapView Docs as drop-in replacement in the layout.xml, another option is to use support-library up from rev. 11 but then take programmatic approach since nested fragments are neither supported via layout. Or just working around programmatically by explicitely destroying the fragment (like in the answer from Matt / Vidar), btw: same effect is achieved using the MapView (option 1).But actually, I did not want to loose the map everytime I tab away, that is, I wanted to keep it in memory and cleanup only upon activity close, so I decided to simply hide/show the map while tabbing, see FragmentTransaction / hideI respect all the answers but i found this one liner solution:\nIf n Is the Number of tabs then:Example:\nIn case mentioned :View pager implements a queue so, you don\'t have to let it remove that fragment. onCreateView is called only once.Declare SupportMapFragment object globallyIn onCreateView() method put below codeIn onDestroyView() put below codeIn your xml file put below codeAbove code solved my problem and it\'s working fineNested fragments are not currently supported.\nTry Support Package, revision 11.Have you been trying to reference your custom MapFragment class in the layout file?If you will use only Vidar Wahlberg answer, you get error when you open other activity (for example) and back to map. Or in my case open other activity and then from new activity open map again( without use back button).\nBut when you combine Vidar Wahlberg solution and Matt solution you will have not exceptions.layoutFragmentI had this in viewPager and the crash was because any fragment had to have its own tag, duplicate tags or ids for same fragment are not allowed.I think there was some bugs in previous App-Compat lib for child Fragment. I tried @Vidar Wahlberg and @Matt\'s ans they did not work for me. After updating the appcompat library my code run perfectly without any extra effort.Things to Note here is your app will crash badly in either of two cases:-1) In order to reuse fragment with Maps again MapView Fragment must be removed when\n  your fragment showing Maps got replaced with other fragment in onDestroyView callback.else when you try to inflate same fragment twice Duplicate ID, tag null, or parent id with another fragment for com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment error will happen. 2) Secondly you must not mix app.Fragment operations with\n  android.support.v4.app.Fragment API operations eg.do not use\n  android.app.FragmentTransaction to remove v4.app.Fragment type \n  MapView  Fragment. Mixing this will again result into crash from fragment side. Here is sample code snippet for correct usage of MapViewXMLResult looks like this :-Hope it will help Somebody.In this solution you do not need to take static variable;Why don\'t you insert a map using the MapView object instead of MapFragment ? I am not sure if there is any limitation in MapView,though i found it helpful.
