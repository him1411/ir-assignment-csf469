How to set radio option checked onload with jQuery? Need to check if no default is set and then set a defaultSay you had radio buttons like these, for example:And you wanted to check the one with a value of "Male" onload if no radio is checked:How about a one liner?This one will cause form.reset() failure:But this one works:JQuery has actually two ways to set checked status for radio and checkboxes and it depends on whether you are using value attribute in HTML markup or not:In first case, we specify the entire radio group using name and tell JQuery to find radio to select using val function. The val function takes 1-element array and finds the radio with matching value, set its checked=true. Others with the same name would be deselected. If no radio with matching value found then all will be deselected. If there are multiple radios with same name and value then the last one would be selected and others would be deselected.If you are not using value attribute for radio then you need to use unique ID to select particular radio in the group. In this case, you need to use prop function to set "checked" property. Many people don\'t use value attribute with checkboxes so #2 is more applicable for checkboxes then radios. Also note that as checkboxes don\'t form group when they have same name, you can do $("[name=myCheckBox").prop("checked", true); for checkboxes.You can play with this code here: http://jsbin.com/OSULAtu/1/edit?html,outputI liked the answer by @Amc. I found the expression could be condensed further to not use a filter() call (@chaiko apparently also noticed this). Also, prop() is the way to go vs attr() for jQuery v1.6+, see the jQuery documentation for prop() for the official best practices on the subject.Consider the same input tags from @Paolo Bergantino\'s answer.The updated one-liner might read something like:I think you can assume, that name is unique and all radio in group has the same name. Then you can use jQuery support like that:Note: Passing array is important.Conditioned version:If you want it to be truly dynamic and select the radio that corresponds to the incoming data, this works. It\'s using the gender value of the data passed in or uses default.Don\'t need all that.\nWith simple and old HTML you can achieve what you want.\nIf you let the radio you want checked by default like this:\n<input type=\'radio\' name=\'gender\' checked=\'true\' value=\'Male\'>\nWhen page loads, it\'ll come checked.Here is example with above methods:In javascript:And if you want to pass a value from your model and want to select a radio button from the group on load based on value, than use:Jquery:And the html:Note this behavior when getting radio input values:So $(\'input[name="myRadio"]\').val() does not return the checked value of the radio input, as you might expect -- it returns the first radio button\'s value.Native JS solution:http://jsfiddle.net/jzQvH/75/HTML: //If you are doing it on javascript or a framework like backbone, you will encounter this a lot\nyou could have something like thiswhilewill not work,will.your selector can be as the other guys above recommended too.
