I asked a similar question to this earlier this week but I\'m still not understanding how to get a list of all installed applications and then pick one to run. I\'ve tried: and this only shows application that are preinstalled or can run the ACTION_MAIN Intent type.I also know I can use PackageManager to get all the installed applications, but how do I use this to run a specific application?Following is the code to get the list of activities/applications installed on Android :You will get all the necessary data in the ResolveInfo to start a application. You can check ResolveInfo javadoc here.HTH !Here\'s a cleaner way using the packageManagerMore info here http://qtcstation.com/2011/02/how-to-launch-another-app-from-your-app/Another way to filter on system apps (works with the example above):Here a good example:Getting list of installed non-system appsTo filter on sytem based apps :To get al installed apps you can use Package Manager..To run you can use package nameFor more detail you can read this blog http://codebucket.co.in/android-get-list-of-all-installed-apps/You can Find the List of installed apps in Android Device by using below code, "packageInfo" Contains Installed Application Information\nin Device. we can retrive Intent for the application installed from\nthe packageinfo object and by using startactivity(intent), can start\napplication. it is up to you how you organize the UI either Listview\nor Gridview. so on click event based on position, you can retrive intent\nobject and start activity intent.If there are multiple launchers in a one package above code has a problem. Eg: on LG Optimus Facebook for LG, MySpace for LG, Twitter for LG contains in a one package name SNS and if you use above SNS will repeat. After hours of research I came with below code. Seems to work well.@Jas:\nI don\'t have that code anymore, but I\'ve found something close. I\'ve made this to search for "components" of my application, they are just activities with a given category. I\'ve commented the part where it gets the activity name, but it\'s pretty straightforward.The idea behind this solution is that the main activity of every system app does not have a custom activity icon. This method gives me an excellent result:I had a requirement to filter out the system apps which user do not really use(eg. "com.qualcomm.service", "update services", etc). Ultimately I added another condition to filter down the app list. I just checked whether the app has \'launcher intent\'.So, the resultant code looks like...I have another solution:you can use this :
