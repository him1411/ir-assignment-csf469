I was setting up another user to use our SVN repository.  He didn\'t have a username/password, so I logged in with my credentials.   We now have a username/password for him.How do I get TortoiseSVN to logout and forget the old password so I can enter the new username/password?All saved Authentication Data for all projects is deleted.You will have to re-enter credentials to reconnect.There are several ways to do it, through settings or by deleting the cache.Deleting the cache is the most versatile method. First, locate it:On XP, it was located here:On Vista, it was located here:Then look in those files with Notepad, and delete the one with your credentials.If you want to remove only one saved password, e.g. for "user1":  After struggling with this and trying all the answers on this page, I finally realized I had the incorrect credentials stored by windows for the server that hosts our subversion.  I cleared this stored value from windows credentials and all is well.http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/remove-stored-passwords-certificates-and-other-credentialsYou can\'t change your password through Tortoise, it has to be changed on the SVN server itself. As administrator only have the permission to change the passwordReplace the line in htpasswd file:go to: http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator-windows/(if the link is expired, search another generator from google.com)Enter your username and password. The site will generate encrypted line. Copy that line and replace it with the previous line in the file "repo/htpasswd".You might also need to \'clear\' the \'Authentication data\' from tortoisSVN -> settings -> saved data
