It seems so "dirty" emptying a list in this way:Does a clear way exist to do that?This actually removes the contents from the list, not replaces the old label with a new empty listexample:For the sake of completeness, slice assignment achieves the same effect:and can be used to shrink a part of the list while replacing a part at the same time (but is out of scope of the question).Note that doing lst = [] does not empty the list, just creates a new object and binds it to the variable lst, but the old list will still have the same elements, and effect will be apparent if it had other variable bindings.You could try:Which means: Splice in the list [] (0 elements) at the location [:] (all indexes from start to finish)The [:] is the slice operator. See this question for more information.If you have Python 3.3 or better, you could use the clear() method of list which is parallel to clear() of dict, set, deque and other mutable container types:As per the linked page, the same can also be achieved with alist *= 0.it turns out that with python 2.5.2, del l[:] is slightly slower than l[:] = [] by 1.1 usec.Another simple code you could use (depending on your situation) is:You have to start index at the length of the list and go backwards versus index at 0, forwards because that would end you up with index equal to the length of the list with it only being cut in half.Also, be sure that the while line has a "greater than or equal to" sign. Omitting it will leave you with list[0] remaining.will reset list to an empty list.Note that you generally should not shadow reserved function names, such as list, which is the constructor for a list object -- you could use lst or list_ instead, for instance.
