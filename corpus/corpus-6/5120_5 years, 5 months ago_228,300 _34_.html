Say I have an array of a few objects:How can I sort this array by the date element in order from the date closest to the current date and time down? Keep in mind that the array may have many objects, but for the sake of simplicity I used 2.Would I use the sort function and a custom comparator?UPDATEIn my specific case, I wanted the dates arranged from the most recent to the oldest. It ended up that I had to reverse the simple function\'s logic as so:This sorts the dates from the most recent.Or more tersely:Define a custom non-enumerable sortBy function using a Schwartzian transform on all arrays :Use it like so:If your date is not directly comparable, make a comparable date out of it, e.g.You can also use this to sort by multiple criteria if you return an array of values:See http://phrogz.net/JS/Array.prototype.sortBy.js for more details.After correcting the JSON this should work.@Phrogz answers are both great, but here is a great, more concise answer:found here: Sort date in JavascriptYour data needs some corrections:After correcting the data, you can use this piece of code:A best implementation of sortBy method by implementing Schwartzian transform can be found here: gist: sortBy.jsFor now we are going to try this approach gist: sortBy-old.js.\nLet\'s create a method to sort arrays being able to arrange objects by some property.Finally, we arrange the array, by "date" property as stringIf you want to ignore letter case, set the "parser" callback:If you want to treat the "date" field as Date type:Here you can play with the above example:\nhttp://jsbin.com/kucawudaco/you can also use this link. it provides callbacks functions that can be passed to generic sort() function You could use sortBy in underscore js. http://underscorejs.org/#sortBySample:i was able to achieve sorting using below lines:For anyone who is wanting to sort by date (UK format), I used the following:I have just taken the Schwartzian transform depicted above and made as function. It takes an array, the sorting function and a boolean as input:I\'m going to add this here, as some uses may not be able to work out how to invert this sorting method.To sort by \'coming up\', we can simply swap a & b, like so:Notice that a is now on the left hand side, and b is on the right, :D!
