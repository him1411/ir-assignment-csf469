If I have a .html file in a GitHub repository, e.g. for running a a set of JavaScript tests, is there any way I can view that page directly\xe2\x80\x94thus running the tests?For example, could I somehow actually see the test results that would be produced by the jQuery test suite, without downloading or cloning the repo to my local drive and running them there?I know this would basically put GitHub in the static content hosting business, but then again, they just have to change their mime-type from text/plain to text/html.An alternative to http://htmlpreview.github.com would be http://rawgithub.com. It provides a more convenient way to preview your files.The site has been renamed to http://rawgit.com:In your case .html extensionIn your case .html extensionNow it seems to be able to use CDN in production as well, which is pretty cool:BeforeAfterCDNThere is a new tool called GitHub HTML Preview, which does exactly what you want. Just prepend http://htmlpreview.github.com/? to the URL of any HTML file, e.g. http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/gh-pages/2.3.2/index.htmlNote: This tool is actually a github.io page and is not affiliated with github as a company.To piggyback on @niutech\'s answer, you can make a very simple bookmark snippet.\nUsing Chrome, though it works similarly with other browsers You can either branch gh-pages to run your code or try this extension (Chrome, Firefox):\nhttps://github.com/ryt/githtmlIf what you need are tests, you could embed your JS files into:\nhttp://jsperf.com/I had the same problem for my project Ratio.js and here\'s what I did.Problem:\nGithub.com prevents files from rendering/executing when the source is viewed by setting the content type/MIME to plain text.Solution:\nHave a web page import the files. Example:Use jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com to create a webpage online then save it. \nNavigate to your file in Github.com and click the \'raw\' button to get the direct link to the file.\nFrom there, import the file using the appropriate tag and attribute.Live Demo: \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/jKu4q/2/Note: Note for jsfiddle.net you can get direct access to the result page by adding show to the end of the url.\nLike so: http://jsfiddle.net/jKu4q/2/showOr....you could create a project page and render your HTML files from there.\nYou can create a project page at http://pages.github.com/.Once created you can then access the link through http://*accountName*.github.com/*projectName*/\nExample: http://larrybattle.github.com/Ratio.js/Here is a little Greasemonkey script that will add a CDN button to html pages on githubTarget page will be of the form: https://cdn.rawgit.com/user/repo/master/filename.jsi wanted to edit html and js in github and have a preview. \ni wanted to do it in github to have instant commits and saves.tried rawgithub.com but rawgithub.com was not realtime (it\'s cache refreshes once a minute).so i quickly developed my own solution:node.js solution for this: https://github.com/shimondoodkin/rawgithubYou can do this easily by Modifying Response Headers which can be done with Chrome and Firefox extension like Requestly.In Chrome and Firefox:Install Requestly for Chrome and Requestly for FirefoxAdd the following Headers Modification Rules:a) Content-Type:b) Content-Security-Policy:raw.github.com/user/repository is no longer thereTo link, href to source code in github, you have to use github link to raw source this way:raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repository/master/file.extensionEXAMPLEThis solution only for chrome browser. I am not sure about other browser.
