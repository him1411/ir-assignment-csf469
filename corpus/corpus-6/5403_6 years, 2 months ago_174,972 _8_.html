In Python, there are two similarly-named functions, exit() and sys.exit(). What\'s the difference and when should I use one over the other?exit is a helper for the interactive shell - sys.exit is intended for use in programs.The site module (which is imported automatically during startup, except if the -S command-line option is given) adds several constants to the built-in namespace (e.g. exit). They are useful for the interactive interpreter shell and should not be used in programs.Technically, they do mostly the same: raising SystemExit. sys.exit does so in sysmodule.c:While exit is defined in site.py:Note that there is a third exit option, namely os._exit, which exits without calling cleanup handlers, flushing stdio buffers, etc. (and which  should normally only be used in the child process after a fork()).If I use exit() in a code and run it in the shell, it shows a message asking whether I want to kill the program or not. It\'s really disturbing.\nSee hereBut sys.exit() is better in this case. It closes the program and doesn\'t create any dialogue box.
