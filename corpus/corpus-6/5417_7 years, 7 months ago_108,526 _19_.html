I installed ReSharper, and it works in Visual Studio, but how can disable it?Whenever I search in the ReSharper menu I can\'t find a disable option.You can disable ReSharper 5 and newer versions by using the Suspend button in menu Tools -> Options -> ReSharper.If you want to do it without clicking too much, open the Command Window (Ctrl + W, A) and type:ReSharper_Suspend or ReSharper_Resume depending on what you want.Or you can even set a keyboard shortcut for this purpose. In Visual Studio, go to Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Keyboard.There you can assign a keyboard shortcut to ReSharper_Suspend and ReSharper_Resume.The Command Window can also be opened with Ctrl + Alt + A, just in case you\'re in the editor.Bind ReSharper_ToggleSuspended to a shortcut key.Steps:Binding ReSharper_ToggleSuspended to a shortcut key (in my case: Ctrl-Shift-Q) works very well.  With ReSharper not supporting the async CTP yet (as of mid-2011), when dipping into the code the uses the async keyword, this shortcut is invaluable.You can add a menu item to toggle ReSharper if you don\'t want to use the command window or a shortcut key. Sadly the ReSharper_ToggleSuspended command can\'t be directly added to a menu (there\'s an open issue on that), but it\'s easy enough to work around:Create a macro like this:Then add a menu item to run that macro:You need to goto Tools-->Options--->Select Resharper--->Click on suspend now,to disable itIn ReSharper 8:\nTools -> Options -> ReSharper -> Suspend NowTools -> Options -> ReSharper (Tick "Show All setting" if ReSharper option not available ). Then you can do Suspend or Resume. Hope it helps (I tested only in VS2005)
