What is the use of LayoutInflater in Android?When you use a custom view in a ListView you must define the row layout.\nYou create an xml where you place android widgets and then in the adapter\'s code you have to do something like this:LayoutInflater class is used to instantiate layout XML file into its corresponding View objects.In other words, it takes as input an XML file and builds the View objects from it.LayoutInflater.inflate() provides a means to convert a res/layout/*.xml file defining a view into an actual View object usable in your application source code.basic two steps: get the inflater and then inflate the resourceHow do you get the inflater? How do you get the view assuming the xml file is "list_item.xml"?When I first started Android programming, I was really confused by LayoutInflater and findViewById. Sometimes we used one and sometimes the other.So if the view already exists, then use findViewById. If not, then create it with a LayoutInflater.Here is a mini project I made that shows both LayoutInflater and findViewById in action. With no special code, the layout looks like this.The blue square is a custom layout inserted into the main layout with include (see here for more). It was inflated automatically because it is part of the content view. As you can see, there is nothing special about the code.Now let\'s inflate (create) another copy of our custom layout and add it in.To inflate the new view layout, all I did was tell the inflater the name of my xml file (my_layout), the parent layout that I want to add it to (mainLayout), and that I don\'t actually want to add it yet (false). (I could also set the parent to null, but then the layout parameters of my custom layout\'s root view would be ignored.)Here it is again in context.Notice how findViewById is used only after a layout has already been inflated.Here is the xml for the example above.activity_main.xmlmy_layout.xmlHere is another example similar to the previous one, but extended to further demonstrate inflate parameters and dynamic behavior it can provide.Suppose your ListView row layout can have variable number of TextViews. So first you inflate the base item View (just like the previous example), and then loop dynamically adding TextViews at run-time. Using android:layout_weight additionally aligns everything perfectly.Here are the Layouts resources: list_layout.xmlschedule_layout.xmlOverride getView method in extension of BaseAdapter classNote different inflate method calls:This class is used to instantiate layout XML file into its corresponding View objects. It is never be used directly -- use getLayoutInflater() or getSystemService(String) to retrieve a standard LayoutInflater instance that is already hooked up to the current context and correctly configured for the device you are running on. For example:Reference: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/LayoutInflater.htmlWhat inflater doesIt takes a xml layout as input (say) and converts it to View object. Why neededLet us think a scenario where we need to create a custom listview. Now each row should be custom. But how can we do it. Its not possible to assign a xml layout to a row of listview. So, we create a View object. Thus we can access the elements in it (textview,imageview etc) and also assign the object as row of listviewSo, whenever we need to assign view type object somewhere and we have our custom xml design we just convert it to object by inflater and use it. Inflating means reading the XML file that describes a layout (or GUI element) and to create the actual objects that correspond to it, and thus make the object visible within an Android app.This file could saved as date_time_dialog.xml:This file could saved as date_time_picker.xml:The MainActivity class saved as MainActivity.java:here is an example for geting a refrence for the root View of a layout , \ninflating it and using it with setContentView(View view) Layout inflater is a class that reads the xml appearance description and convert them into java based View objects.my customize list hope it illustrate conceptLayoutInflater is a fundamental component in Android. You must use it all the time to turn xml files into view hierarchies. LayoutInflater creates View objects based on layouts defined in XML. There are several different ways to use LayoutInflater, including creating custom Views, inflating Fragment views into Activity views, creating Dialogs, or simply inflating a layout file View into an Activity.There are a lot of misconceptions about how the inflation process works. I think this comes from poor of the documentation for the inflate() method. If you want to learn about the inflate() method in detail, I wrote a blog post about it here:https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/understanding-androids-layoutinflater-inflate/Inflater actually some sort of convert to data,  views, instances, to visible UI representation.. ..thus it make use of data feed into from maybe adapters,  etc. programmatically. then integrating it with an xml you defined, that tells it how the data should be represented in UI
