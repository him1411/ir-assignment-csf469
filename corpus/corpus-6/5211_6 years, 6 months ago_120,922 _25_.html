I\'ve started using vimdiff today, and wanted to do some of the things that I\'ve taken for granted on Windows based diff editors (like expand/collapse a diff section, have full file expansion/only diffs with 3 context lines above or below, etc.). I currently know only the following commands :Keyboard Shortcuts:do - Get changes from other window into the current window.dp - Put the changes from current window into the other window.]c - Jump to the next change.[c - Jump to the previous change.Ctrl+W, w - Switch to the other split window (CTRL-W CTRL-W does the same\nthing, in case you let go of the CTRL key a bit later)Could someone point me to the right direction so I could replicate similar features?It would be nice if I could expand/collapse lines around the diffs, for example.Aside from the ones you mention, I only use frequently when diffing the following:Most of what you asked for is folding: vim user manual\'s chapter on folding. Outside of diffs I sometime use:But you\'ll probably be better served by:or even:The other thing you asked for, use n lines of folding, can be found at the vim reference manual section on options, via the section on diff:You should also take a look at the user manual section on diff.set vimdiff to ignore caseHaving started vim diff withI find that annoyingly one file has MySQL keywords in lowercase the other uppercase showing differences on practically every other linethis updates the screen dynamically & you can just as easily switch it off againActually if you do Ctrl+W W, you won\'t need to add that extra Ctrl. Does the same thing.ctrl + w, w as mentioned can be used for navigating from pane to pane. Now you can select a particular change alone and paste it to the other pane as follows.Here I am giving an eg as if I wanted to change my piece of code from pane 1 to pane 2 and currently my cursor is in pane1Use Shift-v to highlight a line and use up or down keys to select the piece of code you require and continue from step 3 written below to paste your changes in the other pane.Use visual mode and then change it1 click \'v\'  this will take you to visual mode\n2 use up or down key to select your required code \n3 click on ,Esc\' escape key\n4 Now use \'yy\'  to copy or \'dd\' to cut the change\n5 do \'ctrl + w, w\' to navigate to pane2\n6 click \'p\' to paste your change where you require
