This is PascalCase: SomeSymbolThis is camelCase: someSymbolThis is snake_case: some_symbolSo my questions is whether there is a widely accepted name for this: some-symbol? It\'s commonly used in url\'s.There isn\'t really a specific standard name for this case convention, and there is disagreement over what it should be called.Lisp has used this convention for decades as described in this Wikipedia entry. For that reason, it was described as lisp-case in a question on Programmers SE similar to this one on. This seems to be an original coining.And according to this Wikipedia entry, it may also be called spinal-case or kebab-case (and the upper case version called Train-Case). All of these forms have also been contested as original coinings.So the answer to your question is: No, there isn\'t a single widely-accepted name for this case convention analogous to snake_case or camelCase, which are widely-accepted.It\'s referred to as kebab-case. See lodash docs.It\'s also sometimes known as caterpillar-caseAdding the correct link here Kebab Casewhich is All lowercase with - separating words.I\'d simply say that it was hyphenated.I\'ve always called it, and heard it be called, \'dashcase.\'There is no standardized name.Libraries like jquery and lodash refer it as kebab-case. So does Vuejs javascript framework. However, I am not sure whether it\'s safe to declare that it\'s referred as kebab-case in javascript world.As the character (-) is referred to as "hyphen" or "dash", it seems more natural to name this "dash-case", or "hyphen-case" (less frequently used).As mentioned in Wikipedia, "kebab-case" is also used. Apparently (see answer) this is because the character would look like a skewer... It needs some imagination though.\nUsed in lodash lib for example.Recently, "dash-case" was used byHere is a more recent discombobulation. Documentation everywhere in angular JS and Pluralsight courses and books on angular, all refer to kebab-case as snake-case, not differentiating between the two.Its too bad caterpillar-case did not stick because snake_case and caterpillar-case are easily remembered and actually look like what they represent (if you have a good imagination).
