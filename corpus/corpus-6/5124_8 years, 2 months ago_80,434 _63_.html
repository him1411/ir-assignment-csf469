Example:This is pretty thorough:Works with all these (and doesn\'t harm already-un-cameled versions):Or if you\'re going to call it a zillion times, you can pre-compile the regexes:Don\'t forget to import the regular expression moduleThere\'s an inflection library in the package index that can handle these things for you. In this case, you\'d be looking for inflection.underscore():I don\'t know why these are all so complicating.for most cases the simple expression ([A-Z]+) will do the trickTo ignore the first charachter simply add look behind (?!^)If you want to separate ALLCaps to all_caps and expect numbers in your string you still don\'t need to do two separate runs just use | This expression ((?<=[a-z0-9])[A-Z]|(?!^)[A-Z](?=[a-z])) can handle just about every scenario in the bookIt all depends on what you want so use the solution that best fits your needs as it should not be overly complicated.nJoy!Personally I am not sure how anything using regular expressions in python can be described as elegant. Most answers here are just doing "code golf" type RE tricks. Elegant coding is supposed to be easily understood.I don\'t get idea why using both .sub() calls? :) I\'m not regex guru, but I simplified function to this one, which is suitable for my certain needs, I just needed a solution to convert camelCasedVars from POST request to vars_with_underscore: It does not work with such names like getHTTPResponse, cause I heard it is bad naming convention (should be like getHttpResponse, it\'s obviously, that it\'s much easier memorize this form).For the fun of it:Or, more for the fun of it:Here\'s my solution:It supports those corner cases discussed in the comments. For instance, it\'ll convert getHTTPResponseCode to get_http_response_code like it should.stringcase is my go-to library for this; e.g.:Not in the standard library, but I found this script that appears to contain the functionality you need.This is not a elegant method, is a very \'low level\' implementation of a simple state machine (bitfield state machine), possibly the most anti pythonic mode to resolve this,  however re module also implements a too complex state machine to resolve this simple task, so i think this is a good solution.splitsymbol can parses all case types: UpperSEQUENCEInterleaved, under_score, BIG_SYMBOLS and cammelCasedMethodsI hope it is usefulUsing regexes may be the shortest, but this solution is way more readable:Lightely adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/users/267781/matth\nwho use generators.Take a look at the excellent Schematics lib https://github.com/schematics/schematicsIt allows you to created typed data structures that can serialize/deserialize from python to Javascript flavour, eg:A horrendous example using regular expressions (you could easily clean this up :) ):Works for getHTTPResponseCode though!Alternatively, using lambda:EDIT: It should also be pretty easy to see that there\'s room for improvement for cases like "Test", because the underscore is unconditionally inserted.Wow I just stole this from django snippets. ref http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/585/Pretty elegant Example:Returns:Here\'s something I did to change the headers on a tab-delimited file. I\'m omitting the part where I only edited the first line of the file. You could adapt it to Python pretty easily with the re library. This also includes separating out numbers (but keeps the digits together). I did it in two steps because that was easier than telling it not to put an underscore at the start of a line or tab.Step One...find uppercase letters or integers preceded by lowercase letters, and precede them with an underscore:Search:Replacement:Step Two...take the above and run it again to convert all caps to lowercase:Search:Replacement (that\'s backslash, lowercase L, backslash, one):I have had pretty good luck with this one:This could obviously be optimized for speed a tiny bit if you want to.I was looking for a solution to the same problem, except that I needed a chain; e.g.Starting from the nice two-word solutions here, I came up with the following:Most of the complicated logic is to avoid lowercasing the first word.  Here\'s a simpler version if you don\'t mind altering the first word:Of course, you can pre-compile the regular expressions or join with underscore instead of hyphen, as discussed in the other solutions.Concise without regular expressions, but HTTPResponseCode=> httpresponse_code:Without any library :A bit heavy, butVery nice RegEx proposed on this site:If python have a String Split method, it should work...In Java:This simple method should do the job:(taken from here, see working example online)I prefer to avoid re if possible:myString="ThisStringIsCamelCase"\n\'\'.join([\'_\'+i.lower() if i.isupper() else i for i in myString]).lstrip(\'_\')\n\'this_string_is_camel_case\'And if we need to cover a case with already-un-cameled input:Use: str.capitalize() to convert first letter of the string (contained in variable str) to a capital letter and returns the entire string.Example:\nCommand: "hello".capitalize() \nOutput: Hello
