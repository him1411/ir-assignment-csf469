I\'m trying to get Javascript to read/write to a PostgreSQL database. I found this project on github. I was able to get the following sample code to run in node.Next I tried to make it run on a webpage, but nothing seemed to happen. I checked on the Javascript console and it just says "require not defined."So what is this "require?" Why does it work in node but not in a webpage?Also, before I got it to work in node, I had to do npm install pg. What\'s that about? I looked in the directory and didn\'t find a file pg. Where did it put it, and how does Javascript find it?require() is not part of your standard JavaScript. In context to your question and tags, require() is built into Node.js to load modules. The concept is similar to C/Java/Python/[insert more languages here] imports or includes.The concept of modules is similar to just adding small bits of JavaScript code via <script> tags. Unlike adding a <script> tag, it doesn\'t leak the file into the global scope. The file has its own scope, essentially trapping everything you define in that file, unless you decide to expose functionality.  require returns a value, depending on what the module exposes using exports or module.exports. Another post explains how require() works in conjunction with exports.Â In your code, it loads the pg module, which I guess is a PostgreSQL driver for NodeJS. The part where you do npm install pg downloads the pg module from npm (a package repository for NodeJS modules) and makes it available to your project via require(\'pg\');.Just in case you were wondering why I mentioned "in context to your question", there are 3rd-party libraries that also use a function named require to do something. It\'s handy to identify which is which.RequireJS exposes a function called require, along with define to load dependencies before running the code provided. The syntax is in AMD format.Neuter, which concatenates js files, also exposes a function named require. This one acts much closer to PHP\'s import.Browserify uses require on the browser, allowing scripts on the browser to be written NodeJS style (CommonJS module syntax).Alright, so let\'s first start with making the distinction between Javascript in a web browser, and Javascript on a server (CommonJS and Node).Javascript is a language traditionally confined to a web browser with a limited global context defined mostly by what came to be known as the Document Object Model (DOM) level 0 (the Netscape Navigator Javascript API).Server-side Javascript eliminates that restriction and allows Javascript to call into various pieces of native code (like the Postgres library) and open sockets.Now require() is a special function call defined as part of the CommonJS spec. In node, it resolves libraries and modules in the Node search path, now usually defined as node_modules in the same directory (or the directory of the invoked javascript file) or the system-wide search path.To try to answer the rest of your question, we need to use a proxy between the code running in the the browser and the database server.Since we are discussing Node and you are already familiar with how to run a query from there, it would make sense to use Node as that proxy.As a simple example, we\'re going to make a URL that returns a few facts about a Beatle, given a name, as JSON.It\'s used to load modules. Let\'s use a simple example.In file circle_object.js:We can use this via require, like:The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules. So, if you want to load a local, relative JavaScript module into a Node.js application, you can simply use the require() method.Example:I noticed that whilst the other answers explained what require is and that it is used to load modules in Node they did not give a full reply on how to load node modules when working in the Browser. It is quite simple to do. Install your module using npm as you describe, and the module itself will be located in a folder usually called node_modules. Now the simplest way to load it into your app is to reference it from your html with a script tag which points at this directory. i.e if your node_modules directory is in the root of the project at the same level as your index.html you would write this in your index.html:That whole script will now be loaded into the page - so you can access its variables and methods directly.There are other approaches which are more widely used in larger projects, such as a module loader like require.js. Of the two, I have not used Require myself, but I think it is considered by many people the way to go.
