How can I pipe the output of a command into my clipboard and paste it back when using a terminal? For instance:I always wanted to do this and found a nice and easy way of doing it. I wrote down the complete procedure just in case anyone else needs it.First install a 16 kB program called xclip:You can then pipe the output into xclip to be copied into the clipboard:To paste the text you just copied, you shall use:To simplify life, you can set up an alias in your .bashrc file as I did:To see how useful this is, imagine I want to open my current path in a new terminal window (there may be other ways of doing it like Ctrl+T on some systems, but this is just for illustration purposes):Notice the ` `  around v. This executes v as a command first and then substitutes it in-place for cd to use.Only copy the content to the X clipboardIf you want to paste somewhere else other than a X application, try this one: On OS X, use pbcopy; pbpaste goes in the opposite direction.I wrote this little script that takes the guess work out of the copy/paste commands.The Linux version of the script relies on xclip being already installed in your system. The script is called clipboard.The OS X version of the script relies on pbcopy and pbpaste which are preinstalled on all Macs.Using the script is very simple since you simply pipe in or out of clipboard as shown in these two examples.Add this to to your ~/.bashrc:Now clipp pastes and cclip copies — but you can also do fancier stuff:↑ indents your clipboard; good for sites without stack overflow\'s { } buttonYou can add it by running this:I\'ve created a tool for Linux/OSX/Cygwin that is similar to some of these others but slightly unique. I call it cb and it can be found in this github gist.In that gist I demonstrate how to do copy and paste via commandline using Linux, macOS, and Cygwin.Note: I originally just intended to mention this in my comment to Bob Enohp\'s answer. But then I realized that I should add a README to my gist. Since the gist editor doesn\'t offer a Markdown preview I used the answer box here and after copy/pasting it to my gist thought, "I might as well submit the answer."This script is modeled after tee (see man tee).It\'s like your normal copy and paste commands, but unified and able to sense when you want it to be chainable(chronologically it made sense to demo this at the end)I am using Parcellite and xsel to copy last commit message from git to my clipboard manager (for some reason xclip does not work):I made a small tool providing similar functionality, without using xclip or xsel. stdout is copied to a clipboard and can be pasted again in the terminal. See: https://sourceforge.net/projects/commandlinecopypaste/Note, that this tool does not need an X-session. The clipboard can just be used within the terminal and has not to be pasted by Ctrl+V or middle-mouse-click into other X-windows.In Linux with xclip installed:xclip -selection clipboard < fileWithout using external tools, if you are connecting to the server view SSH, this is a relatively easy command:From a Windows 7+ command prompt:This will put the content of the remote file to your local clipboard.(The command requires running Pageant for the key, or it will ask you for a password.)
