All I need to do is to execute a callback function when my current function execution ends.A consumer for this function should be like this:How do I implement this?Actually, your code will pretty much work as is, just declare your callback as an argument and you can call it directly using the argument name.That will call doSomething, which will call foo, which will alert "stuff goes here".Note that it\'s very important to pass the function reference (foo), rather than calling the function and passing its result (foo()). In your question, you do it properly, but it\'s just worth pointing out because it\'s a common error.Sometimes you want to call the callback so it sees a specific value for this. You can easily do that with the JavaScript call function:You can also pass arguments:Sometimes it\'s useful to pass the arguments you want to give the callback as an array, rather than individually. You can use apply to do that:It is good practice to make sure the callback is an actual function before attempting to execute it:My 2 cent. Same but different...============================================================================================Result is:When calling the callback function, we could use it like below:consumingFunction(callbackFunctionName)Example:This is the Codepend with full example.Try:Functions are first class in JavaScript; you can just pass them around.
