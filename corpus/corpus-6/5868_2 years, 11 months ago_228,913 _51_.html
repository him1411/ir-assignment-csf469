I am using appcompat v7 to get the look consistent on Android 5 and less. It works rather well. However I cannot figure out how to change the bottom line color and the accent color for EditTexts. Is it possible? I have tried to define a custom android:editTextStyle (cf. below) but I only succeeded to change the full background color or text color but not the bottom line nor the accent color. Is there a specific property value to use? do I have to use a custom drawable image through the android:background property? is it not possible to specify a color in hexa?According to android API 21 sources, EditTexts with material design seem to use colorControlActivated and colorControlNormal. Therefore, I have tried to override these properties in the previous style definition but it has no effect. Probably appcompat does not use it. Unfortunately, I cannot find the sources for the last version of appcompat with material design. Finally, I have found a solution. It simply consists of overriding the value for colorControlActivated, colorControlHighlight and colorControlNormal in your app theme definition and not your edittext style. Then, think to use this theme for whatever activity you desire. Below is an example:I felt like this needed an answer in case somebody wanted to change just a single edittext. I do it like this:While Laurents solution is correct, it comes with some drawbacks as described in the comments since not only the bottom line of the EditText gets tinted but the Back Button of the Toolbar, CheckBoxes etc. as well.Luckily v22.1 of appcompat-v7 introduced some new possibilities. Now it\'s possible to assign a specific theme only to one view. Straight from the Changelog:Deprecated use of app:theme for styling Toolbar. You can now use android:theme for toolbars on all API level 7 and higher devices and android:theme support for all widgets on API level 11 and higher devices. So instead of setting the desired color in a global theme, we create a new one and assign it only to the EditText.Example:For Reference. This can be changed in xml by using:Here is the solution for API < 21 and aboveHope it helpThe accepted answer is a bit more per style basis thing, but the most efficient thing to do is to add the colorAccent attribute in your AppTheme style like this:The colorAccent attribute is used for widget tinting throughout the app and thus should be used for consistencyIf you are using appcompat-v7:22.1.0+ you can use the DrawableCompat to tint your widgetsUse:This will support pre-Lollipop devices not only +21One quick solution for your problem is to look in yourappspackage/build/intermediates/exploded-aar/com.android.support/appcompat-v7/res/drawable/ for abc_edit_text_material.xml and copy that xml file in your drawable folder. Then you can change the colour of the 9 patch files from inside this selector, in order to match your preferences.Here is a part of source code of TextInputLayout in support design library(UPDATED for version 23.2.0), which changes EditText\'s bottom line color in a simpler way:It seems that all of above code become useless right now in 23.2.0 if you want to change the color programatically.And if you want to support all platforms, here is my method:I too was stuck on this problem for too long.  I required a solution that worked for versions both above and below v21.I finally discovered a very simple perhaps not ideal but effective solution: Simply set the background colour to transparent in the EditText properties.I hope this saves someone some time.For me I modified both the AppTheme and a value colors.xml Both the colorControlNormal and the colorAccent helped me change the EditText border color. As well as the cursor, and the "|" when inside an EditText. Here is the colors.xmlI took out the android:textCursorDrawable attribute to @null that I placed inside the editText style. When I tried using this, the colors would not change.If you want change bottom line without using app colors, use these lines in your theme:I don\'t know another solution.You can set background of edittext to a rectangle with minus padding on left, right and top to achieve this. Here is the xml example:Replace the shape with a selector if you want to provide different  width and color for focused edittext.In Activit.XML add the codeWhere BackgroundTint=color for your desired colourI use this method to change the color of the line with PorterDuff, with no other drawable.I was absolutely baffled by this problem. I had tried everything in this thread, and in others, but no matter what I did I could not change the color of the underline to anything other than the default blue.I finally figured out what was going on. I was (incorrectly) using android.widget.EditText when making a new instance (but the rest of my components were from the appcompat library). I should have used android.support.v7.widget.AppCompatEditText. I replaced new EditText(this) with new AppCompatEditText(this)\n and the problem was instantly solved. It turns out, if you are actually using AppCompatEditText, it will just respect the accentColor from your theme (as mentioned in several comments above) and no additional configuration is necessary.This is the easiest and most efficient/reusable/works on all APIs\nCreate a custom EditText class like so:Then use it like this:I worked out a working solution to this problem after 2 days of struggle, below solution is perfect for them who want to change few edit text only, change/toggle color through java code, and want to overcome the problems of different behavior on OS versions due to use setColorFilter() method.Uses in xmlAdd lines in stylejava code to toggle colorTo change the EditText background dynamically, you can use ColorStateList.Credits: This SO answer about ColorStateList is awesome. It\'s very easy just add android:backgroundTint attribute in your EditText.Please modify this method according to your need. This worked for me!
