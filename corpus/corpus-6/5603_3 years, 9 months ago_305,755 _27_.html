I\'m using Google spreadsheet and working on a daily dashboard.  What I need is to change the background color of cell B5 based on the value of another cell - C5.  If C5 is greater than 80% then the background color is green but if it\'s below, it will be amber/red.  Is this available in google spreadsheet functions or do I need to insert a script.  Thanks a lotNote: when it says "B5" in the explanation below, it actually means "B{current_row}", so for C5 it\'s B5, for C6 it\'s B6 and so on. Unless you specify $B$5 - then you refer to one specific cell.This is supported in Google Sheets as of 2015:\nhttps://support.google.com/drive/answer/78413#formulasIn your case, you will need to set conditional formatting on B5. You can repeat this process to add more colors for the background or text or a color scale.Even better, make a single rule apply to all rows by using ranges in "Range". Example assuming the first row is a header: Will be like the previous example but works on all rows, not just row 5.\nRanges can also be used in the "Custom formula is" so you can color an entire row based on their column values.One more example:If you have Column from A to D, and need to highlight the whole line (e.g. from A to D) if B is "Complete", then you can do it following:Of course, you can change Range to A:T if you have more columns.If B contains "Complete", use search as following: I\'ve used an interesting conditional formatting in a recent file of mine and thought it would be useful to others too.\nSo this answer is meant for completeness to the previous ones.It should demonstrate what this amazing feature is capable of, and especially how the $ thing works.The idea is that the color from D to G depend on the values in columns A, B and C. But the formula needs to check values that are fixed horizontally, and others that are fixed vertically. That\'s where the dollar sign gets useful.There are 2 formula to achieve this=AND($A2="foo", D$1>=$B2, D$1<=$C2) on the range D2:G3. Gives blue.=AND($A2="bar", D$1>=$B2, D$1<=$C2) same range. Gives yellow.And(condition1, condition2, condition3)The difference between the 2 formulas is only the user value in the first part of the And().The range that contains colors is D2:G3.Users, start, and end values change on their respective column, while the dates change on the first row only.The 2nd and 3rd conditions (D$1>=$B2) except for the operator.It is also important to understand that this works relatively to the range on which you apply the conditional. Here, the range begins at D2 which means that you should normally enter:I\'ve used data validation too to make it easier to use, but this has nothing to do with the formatting itself.Voila, I hope I\'ve not been too verbose. I tried to explain as much as possible because you never know what people assume to be obvious or not.
