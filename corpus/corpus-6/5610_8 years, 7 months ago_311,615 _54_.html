How do I get the number of days between two dates in JavaScript? For example, given two dates in input boxes:As of this writing, only one of the other answers correctly handles DST (daylight saving time) transitions. Here are the results on a system located in California:Although Math.round returns the correct results, I think it\'s somewhat clunky. Instead, by explicitly accounting for changes to the UTC offset when DST begins or ends, we can use exact arithmetic:JavaScript date calculations are tricky because Date objects store times internally in UTC, not local time. For example, 3/10/2013 12:00\xc2\xa0AM Pacific Standard Time (UTC-08:00) is stored as 3/10/2013 8:00\xc2\xa0AM UTC, and 3/11/2013 12:00\xc2\xa0AM Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-07:00) is stored as 3/11/2013 7:00\xc2\xa0AM UTC. On this day, midnight to midnight local time is only 23 hours in UTC!Although a day in local time can have more or less than 24 hours, a day in UTC is always exactly 24 hours.1 The daysBetween method shown above takes advantage of this fact by first calling treatAsUTC to adjust both local times to midnight UTC, before subtracting and dividing.1. JavaScript ignores leap seconds.The easiest way to get the difference between two dates:You get the difference days (or NaN if one or both could not be parsed). The parse date gived the result in milliseconds and to get it by day you have to divided it by 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000If you want it divided by days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds:Here is my refactored version of James version:I recommend using the moment.js library (http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/difference/).  It handles daylight savings time correctly and in general is great to work with.Example:I would go ahead and grab this small utility and in it you will find functions to this for you. Here\'s a short example:Using Moment.js   Date values in JS are datetime values.So, direct date computations are inconsistent:for example we need to convert de 2nd date:the method could be truncate the mills in both dates: I think the solutions aren\'t correct 100% I would use ceil instead of floor, round will work but it isn\'t the right operation.To Calculate days between 2 given dates you can use the following code.Dates I use here are Jan 01 2016 and Dec 31 2016What about using formatDate from DatePicker widget? You could use it to convert the dates in timestamp format (milliseconds since 01/01/1970) and then do a simple subtraction.I found this question when I want do some calculate on two date, but the date have hours and minutes value, I modified @michael-liu \'s answer to fit my requirement, and it passed my test.diff days 2012-12-31 23:00 and 2013-01-01 01:00 should equal 1. (2 hour)\ndiff days 2012-12-31 01:00 and 2013-01-01 23:00 should equal 1. (46 hour)It is possible to calculate a full proof days difference between two dates resting across different TZs using the following formula:Better to get rid of DST, Math.ceil, Math.floor etc. by using UTC times:This example gives difference 109 days. 24*60*60*1000 is one day in milliseconds.Be careful when using milliseconds.The date.getTime() returns milliseconds and doing math operation with milliseconds requires to includeThe example from comment above is the best solution I found so far\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/11252167/2091095 . But use +1 to its result if you want the to count all days involved.jsfiddle example :)I had the same issue in Angular. I do the copy because else he will overwrite the first date. Both dates must have time 00:00:00 (obviously)If you have two unix timestamps, you can use this function (made a little more verbose for the sake of clarity):Example:I used below code to experiment the posting date functionality for a news post.I calculate the minute or hour or day or year based on the posting date and current date.   if you wanna have an DateArray with dates try this:DebugSnippetThis may not be the most elegant solution, but it seems to answer the question with a relatively simple bit of code, I think.  Can\'t you use something like this:This is assuming you are passing date objects as parameters.If you want a solution that works like the moment.js answers without the library overhead, you can use this component I wrote.For getting days:In addition to calculating the number of days between two dates it can also calculate all the other standard time units (seconds, hours, weeks, months, etc.).To use the dateDiff() method you can import the component.You can use UnderscoreJS for formatting and calculating difference.Demo https://jsfiddle.net/sumitridhal/8sv94msp/Bookmarklet version of other answers, prompting you for both dates:The simple way to calculate days between two dates is to remove both of their time component i.e. setting hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds to 0 and then subtracting their time and diving it with milliseconds worth of one day.
