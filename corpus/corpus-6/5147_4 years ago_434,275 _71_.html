How can I add a glyphicon to a text type input box? For example I want to have \'icon-user\' in a username input, something like this:We\'ll get to Bootstrap in a second, but here\'s the fundamental CSS concepts in play in order to do this yourself.  As beard of prey points out, you can do this with CSS by absolutely positioning the icon inside of the input element.  Then add padding to either side so the text doesn\'t overlap with the icon.So for the following HTML:You can use the following CSS to left and right align glyphs:Note: This presumes you\'re using glyphicons, but works equally well with font-awesome.\n  For FA, just replace .glyphicon with .faAs buffer points out, this can be accomplished natively within Bootstrap by using Validation States with Optional Icons.  This is done by giving the .form-group element the class of .has-feedback and the icon the class of .form-control-feedback.The simplest example would be something like this:Pros:Cons: To overcome the cons, I put together this pull-request with changes to support left aligned icons.  As it is a relatively large change, it has been put off until a future release, but if you need these features today, here\'s a simple implementation guide:If you\'re using less, just include these changes in your project. If you\'re not using less, grab the file and convert it to CSS with any online LESS Compiler.Then, all you have to do is include the class .has-feedback-left on any group that has the class .has-feedback in order to left align the icon.Since there are a lot of possible html configurations over different form types, different control sizes, different icon sets, and different label visibilities, I created a test page that shows the correct set of HTML for each permutation along with a live demo.P.S. frizi\'s suggestion of adding pointer-events: none; has been added to bootstrapDidn\'t find what you were looking for? Try these similar questions:The official method. No custom CSS required : DEMO : http://jsfiddle.net/LS2Ek/1/This demo is based on an example in Bootstrap docs. Scroll down to "With Optional Icons" here http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-control-validationHere\'s a CSS-only alternative. I set this up for a search field to get an effect similar to Firefox (& a hundred other apps.)Here\'s a fiddle.HTMLCSSHere is how I did it using only the default bootstrap CSS v3.3.1:And this is how it looks:This \'cheat\' will work with the side effect that the glyphicon class will change the font for the input control.FiddleIf you want to get rid of the side effect you can remove the "glyphicon" class and add the following CSS (There may be a better way to style the placeholder pseudo element and I\'ve only tested on Chrome).FiddlePossibly an even cleaner solution:FiddleCSSHTMLHere is a non-bootstrap solution that keeps your markup simple by embedding the image representation of the glyphicon directly in the CSS using base64 URI encoding.It can be done using classes from the official bootstrap 3.x version, without any custom css.use input-group-addon before the input tag, inside of input-group then use any of the glyphicons, here is the codeHere is the outputTo customize it further add a couple of lines of custuom css to your own custom.css file (adjust padding if needed)By making the background of the input-group-addon transparent and making the left gradiant of the input tag to zero the input will have a seamless appearance. Here is the customized outputHere is a jsbin exampleThis will solve the custom css problems of overlaping with lables, alignment while using input-lg and focus on tab issue.If you are using Fontawesome you can do this :ResultThe complete list of unicode can be found in the The complete Font Awesome 4.6.3 icon referenceHere\'s another way to do it by placing the glyphicon using the :before pseudo element in CSS.For this HTML:Use this CSS (Bootstrap 3.x and Webkit-based browsers compatible)As @Frizi said, we have to add pointer-events: none; so that the cursor doesn\'t interfere with the input focus. All the others CSS rules are for centering and adding the proper spacing. The result:I also have one decision for this case with Bootstrap 3.3.5: On input I have something like this: \n If you are fortunate enough to only need modern browsers: try css transform translate. This requires no wrappers, and can be customized so that you can allow more spacing for input[type=number] to accomodate the input spinner, or move it to the left of the  handle.http://codepen.io/anon/pen/RPRmNq?editors=110You should be able to do this with existing bootstrap classes and a little custom styling.Edit  The icon is referenced via the icon-user class.
