How do you encode a URL in Android?I thought it was like this:If I do the above, the http:// in urlAsString is replaced by http%3A%2F%2F in encodedURL and then I get a  java.net.MalformedURLException when I use the URL.You don\'t encode the entire URL, only parts of it that come from "unreliable sources".Alternatively, you can use Strings.urlEncode(String str) of DroidParts that doesn\'t throw checked exceptions.Or use something likeI\'m going to add one suggestion here.  You can do this which avoids having to get any external libraries.  Give this a try:You can see that in this particular URL, I need to have those spaces encoded so that I can use it for a request.  This takes advantage of a couple features available to you in Android classes.  First, the URL class can break a url into its proper components so there is no need for you to do any string search/replace work.  Secondly, this approach takes advantage of the URI class feature of properly escaping components when you construct a URI via components rather than from a single string.The beauty of this approach is that you can take any valid url string and have it work without needing any special knowledge of it yourself.  For android, I would use \nString android.net.Uri.encode(String s)Encodes characters in the given string as \'%\'-escaped octets using the UTF-8 scheme. Leaves letters ("A-Z", "a-z"), numbers ("0-9"), and unreserved characters ("_-!.~\'()*") intact. Encodes all other characters.Ex/Also you can use thisit\'s the most simple methodyou can use below methodsorthe second one is better than first.
