I have a table with the following fields:Now, I need  to remove rows having same title, company and site_id. One way to do it will be using the following SQL along with a script (PHP):After running this query, I can remove duplicates using a server side script.\nBut, I want to know if this can be done only using SQL query.A really easy way to do this is to add a UNIQUE index on the 3 columns.  When you write the ALTER statement, include the IGNORE keyword.  Like so:This will drop all the duplicate rows.  As an added benefit, future INSERTs that are duplicates will error out.  As always, you may want to take a backup before running something like this...If you don\'t want to alter the column properties then you can use the query below.Since you have a column which has unique id\'s or any column which has auto_increment properties you can use that column to remove the duplicates.Ideally there are many different ways, the best way is what suites your table/column properties.MySQL has restrictions about referring to the table you are deleting from.  You can work around that with a temporary table, like:From Kostanos\' suggestion in the comments:\nThe only slow query above is DELETE, for cases where you have a very large database. This query could be faster:  If IGNORE statement won\'t work like in my case, you can use:There is another solution :The faster way is to insert distinct rows into a temporary table. Using delete, it took me a few hours to remove duplicates from a table of 8 million rows. Using insert and distinct, it took just 13 minutes.  I have this query snipet for SQLServer but I think It can be used in others DBMS with little changes:I forgot to tell you that this query doesn\'t remove the row with the lowest id of the duplicated rows. If this works for you try this query:  This solution will move the duplicates into one table and the uniques into another.Simple and fast for all cases:I like to be a bit more specific   as to which records I delete  so here is my solution:You can easily delete the duplicate records from this code..I had to do this with text fields and came across the limit of 100 bytes on the index.I solved this by adding a column, doing a md5 hash of the fields, and the doing the alter.
