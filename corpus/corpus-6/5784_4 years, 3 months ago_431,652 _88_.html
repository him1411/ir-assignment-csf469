How can I set for <table> 100% width and put only inside <tbody> vertical scroll for some height?HTML:CSS:I want to avoid adding some additional div, all I want is simple table like this and when I trying to change display, table-layout, position and much more things in CSS table not working good with 100% width only with fixed width in px.In order to make <tbody> element scrollable, we need to change the way it\'s displayed on the page i.e. using display: block; to display that as a block level element.Since we change the display property of tbody, we should change that property for thead element as well to prevent from breaking the table layout.So we have:Web browsers display the thead and tbody elements as row-group (table-header-group and table-row-group) by default.Once we change that, the inside tr elements doesn\'t fill the entire space of their container.In order to fix that, we have to calculate the width of tbody columns and apply the corresponding value to the thead columns via JavaScript.Here is the jQuery version of above logic:And here is the output (on Windows 7 Chrome 32):WORKING DEMO.As the Original Poster needed, we could expand the table to 100% of width of its container, and then using a relative (Percentage) width for each columns of the table.Since the table has a (sort of) fluid layout, we should adjust the width of thead columns when the container resizes.Hence we should set the columns\' widths once the window is resized:The output would be:WORKING DEMO.I\'ve tested the two above methods on Windows 7 via the new versions of major Web Browsers (including IE10+) and it worked.However, it doesn\'t work properly on IE9 and below.That\'s because in a table layout, all elements should follow the same structural properties.By using display: block; for the <thead> and <tbody> elements, we\'ve broken the table structure.One approach is to redesign the (entire) table layout. Using JavaScript to create a new layout on the fly and handle and/or adjust the widths/heights of the cells dynamically.For instance, take a look at the following examples:This approach uses two nested tables with a containing div. The first table has only one cell which has a div, and the second table is placed inside that div element.Check the Vertical scrolling tables at CSS Play.This works on most of web browsers. We can also do the above logic dynamically via JavaScript.Since the purpose of adding vertical scroll bar to the <tbody> is displaying the table header at the top of each row, we could position the thead element to stay fixed at the top of the screen instead.Here is a Working Demo of this approach performed by Julien.\nIt has a promising web browser support.And here a pure CSS implementation by Willem Van Bockstal.Here is the old answer. Of course I\'ve added a new method and refined the CSS declarations.In this case, the table should have a fixed width (including the sum of columns\' widths and the width of vertical scroll-bar).Each column should have a specific width and the last column of thead element needs a greater width which equals to the others\' width + the width of vertical scroll-bar.Therefore, the CSS would be:Here is the output:WORKING DEMO.In this approach, the table has a width of 100% and for each th and td, the value of width property should be less than 100% / number of cols.Also, we need to reduce the width of thead as value of the width of vertical scroll-bar.In order to do that, we need to use CSS3 calc() function, as follows:Here is the Online Demo.Note: This approach will fail if the content of each column breaks the line, i.e. the content of each cell should be short enough.In the following, there are two simple example of pure CSS solution which I created at the time I answered this question.Here is the jsFiddle Demo v2.Old version: jsFiddle Demo v1In following solution, table occupies 100% of the parent container, no absolute sizes required. It\'s pure CSS, flex layout is used.  Here is how it looks:\nPossible disadvantages:HTML (shortened):CSS, with some decorations omitted for clarity:full code on jsfiddle Same code in LESS so you can mix it in:I\'m using display:block for thead and tbody.\nBecause of that the width of the thead columns is different from the width of the tbody columns.table {margin:0 auto; border-collapse:collapse;}\n thead {background:#CCCCCC;display:block}\n tbody {height:10em;overflow-y:scroll;display:block} To fix this I use small jQuery code but it can be done in JavaScript only.Here is my working demo:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/gavroche/N7LEF/Does not work in IE 8Create two tables one after other, put second table in a div of fixed height and set the overflow property to auto. Also keep all the td\'s inside thead in second table empty.I got it finally right with pure CSS by following these instructions:http://tjvantoll.com/2012/11/10/creating-cross-browser-scrollable-tbody/The first step is to set the <tbody> to display: block so an overflow and height can be applied. From there the rows in the <thead> need to be set to position: relative and display: block so that they\xe2\x80\x99ll sit on top of the now scrollable <tbody>.tbody, thead { display: block; overflow-y: auto; }Because the <thead> is relatively positioned each table cell needs an explicit widthBut unfortunately that is not enough. When a scrollbar is present browsers allocate space for it, therefore, the <tbody> ends up having less space available than the <thead>. Notice the slight misalignment this creates...The only workaround I could come up with was to set a min-width on all columns except the last one.Whole codepen example below:CSS:Html:EDIT: Alternative solution for table width 100% (above actually is for fixed width and didn\'t answer the question):HTML:CSS:Demo: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bNJeLOThis solution still requires the th widths to be calculated and set by jQueryAnd the Jquery / Javascripttry below approach, very simple easy to implementBelow is the jsfiddle linkhttp://jsfiddle.net/v2t2k8ke/2/HTML:CSS:Jquery:Adding a fixed width to td,th after making tbody & thead display block works perfectly and also we can use slimscroll plugin to make the scroll bar beautiful.
