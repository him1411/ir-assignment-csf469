Is there a QString function which takes an int and outputs it as a QString?Use QString::number():And if you want to put it into string within some text context, forget about + operator. \nSimply do:Moreover to convert whatever you want, you can use QVariant.\nFor an int to a QString you get:A float to a string or a string to a float:Yet another option is to use QTextStream and the << operator in much the same way as you would use cout in C++:Because operator <<() has been overloaded, you can use it for multiple types, not just int. QString::arg() is overloaded, for example arg(int a1, int a2), but there is no arg(int a1, QString a2), so using QTextStream() and operator << is convenient when formatting longer strings with mixed types.Caution: You might be tempted to use the sprintf() facility to mimic C style printf() statements, but it is recommended to use QTextStream or arg() because they support Unicode strings.I always use QString::setNum().setNum() is overloaded in many ways. See QString class reference.In it\'s simplest form, use the answer of Georg FritzscheFor a bit advanced, you can use this,Get the documentation and an example here..Just for completeness, you can use the standard library and do QString qstr = QString::fromStdString(std::to_string(42));
