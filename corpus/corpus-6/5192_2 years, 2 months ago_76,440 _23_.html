Intellij Idea 14.1.4\nMac OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and later.From the IDE:From shell:(defined in .profile: export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8)"What am I missing. I have checked other discussions in SO, for example, Intellij JAVA_HOME variable, but don\'t have Project SDK prompt. You need to setup a SDK for Java projects, like @rizzletang said, but you don\'t need to create a new project, you can do it from the Welcome screen.On the bottom right, select Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure:\nPicking the Project tab on the left will show that you have no SDK selected:Just click the New... button on the right hand side of the dropdown and point it to your JDK. After that, you can go back to the import screen and it should just show up.If you\'d like to have your JAVA_HOME recognised by intellij, you can do one of these:As others have answered you can ignore JAVA_HOME by setting up SDK in project structure.For Windows Platform:try Running the 64 Bit exe version of IntelliJ from a path similar to following.note that it is available beside the default idea.exe"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\JetBrains\\IntelliJ IDEA 15.0\\bin\\idea64.exe"linkMake sure you have a jdk setup. To do this, create a new project and then go to file -> project structure. From there you can add a new jdk. Once that is setup, go back to your gradle project and you should have a jdk to select in the \'Gradle JVM\' field.Just to add completness to the above selected answer, one can also go the \'Project Setting\' windows (if not on the Welcome screen) in IntelliJ IDEA by clicking:File > Project Structure (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S)And can define Project SDK there!Try starting IntelliJ from terminal.\nYou can find application file under: \n/Applications/IntelliJ\\ IDEA\\ 14.app/Contents/MacOS
