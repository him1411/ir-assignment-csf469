If I create a new project in Visual Studio 2010 SP1 and select "WPF Application" and tries to build the generated application, I get the errorThe name InitializeComponent does not exist in the current context.I got a similar error this morning when I tried to build my current project. Yesterday, I had no problem compiling and running it.I created a new project and got the error whenever I compiled the project. I have just sent the project to a colleague, and he has just compiled without any errors.What is wrong?I\'ve encountered this a couple times and keep forgetting what causes it.\nI ran into this when I renamed the namespace on my code behind file but not in my XAML.So check if you\'ve done the same.  They need to match since they are both part of a partial classThe Build Action for the .xaml file must also be set to "Page", when moving a xaml file between projects this setting gets lost (in VS 2010 at least).For those who (in VS2015) have no errors in Debug mode, but do have the specified error in Release mode (and yet the project runs fine), here is something simple to try:This method worked for me.this happened with me when I accidentaly deleted the class reference from the xaml definition:I\'ve replaced the first line with this:I know this isn\'t the answer to the original question (because thats project builds on another machine), but the error message was the same, so maybe I\'ll help someone with this situation.I encountered this error during refactoring where I renamed some files/folders and the prexisiting *.g.cs files needed to be re-generated.There\'s a very specific reason for this, and it\'s in the project settings. This usually happens whenever you try to add a WPF control/window to a .NET 2.0 class library or project. The reason for this error is that the project does not know it\'s building a WPF control or window and therefore tries to build it as a C# 2.0 project. The solution involves editing the .csproj file. Right click on the project causing the problem and select \xe2\x80\x9cUnload Project\xe2\x80\x9d. Right click the unloaded project and select \xe2\x80\x9cEdit .csproj\xe2\x80\x9d. The .csproj file will open and you can see the XML. look for the following line:It\'s near the end of the file, and the only line that you have is probably This tells Visual Studio to build the project as a .NET 2.0 project. What we want to do is to tell Visual Studio that this is actually a WPF project, so we have to add the following line: This line will tell Visual Studio to build the project as a WPF project. Now your .csproj file bottom should look like this: Save the .csproj file, right click it in Solution Explorer and select \xe2\x80\x9cReload Project\xe2\x80\x9d compile and that\'s it, you\'re all done! Make sure in the xaml filematch the \'Project1\' name and the \'Page1\' nameI encountered this while renaming a usercontrol. The way I fixed it was to comment out InitializeComponent, verify that all the names were correct (xaml and code behind), build the project, uncomment InitializeComponent, then build again.  It sounds like there may be a couple causes/solutions for this issue, but this way did it for me.You might get this error when you import a class from another project, or change the path of the xaml file, or the namespace of either the xaml or behind .cs file.One: It might have a namespace that is not the same as what you have in you new projectAs you can see the name space in the imported file begins with the old project name: "TrainerB", but your new project might have a different name, so just change it to the correct new project name, in both the .xaml file and the behind .cs file.Two:change the properties of the .xaml file to:Build Action: Embedded ResourceCustom Tool: MSBuild:UpdateDesignTimeXamlI\'ve had this (although it was very much my fault and was left after I copied and pasted some code in); it can occur when the namespace doesn\'t match between the XAML and code behindEGand the code behind is Another common cause of this error is if you did something in this:Right click on folder in project to create new UserControl. This creates a class and xaml file that derives from user control in the namespace of the folder.Then you decide to change the namespace of the class because you\'re really just using folders for organization of code. The x:Class attribute will not get automatically updated so it will be searching for a class that doesn\'t exist. Could probably use a better error message like "x:Class type could not be found in namesace bla.blaa.blaaa."I agree with the answer above that the namespaces have to match.  However, I had a problem like this where the namespaces matched.To fix, I simply changed the namespace in the XAML to an INCORRECT one, saved, then changed it back to the CORRECT one.  Voila!None of the above answers worked for me. I tried them all except the duplicate ones. However for some weird reason this worked in my cross-platform project in Visual Studio 2015:This solved it for me. I had commented out the resources in the App.xaml fileCommenting thiis back in to fixed the build error. Digging a bit deeper I found that the app.g.cs file in {Project}\\obj\\debug only contained the following when I left the resource commented in.I try all suggestions above. If you try too without success get the more easy way. Create a new page.xaml then copy your code for new class and delete class XAML with problems. Don\'t spend more time. This happened to me because a Nuget package uninstaller blew away all the attributes on the <Application> element in App.xaml. This included the x:Class attribute, which specifies the application class name. So the partial class containing the InitializeComponent() method was never generated.I fixed the problem by reverting App.xaml to the source-controlled copy.Another solution to this problem is to simply change the property-> Build Action on the XAML from Embedded Resource to anything else, save, then change it right back to Embedded Resource. The error goes away. Unload the entire solution and then reload it again. Then Rebuild the solution. This resolved the issue for me.If you are using Xamarin Forms and you move a XAML file the "build action" of the file is changed. Xamarin Forms requires "build action = Embedded Resource".Apply "build action" in Visual Studio:Select the XAML file -> Properties -> Build Action = Embedded ResourceIf the Namespaces are correct then also there is a same error, Just close your application and open it again.This may solve your problemAfter some action the namespace of the .cs file and the one in .xaml file may be different (in xaml look for the x:Class="namespace.yourType").Fix them to be the same.I have discovered that the "Startup object" was (Not set) causing this error for me."Startup object" (Not set)yeap, so many things can be... I would add this one...\nmake sure the App.xaml points to your Namespace (where your app file is) + .App\neg.\nx:Class="DX.App"   <=== make sure this is App and not the Main Page nameHope this works for you too.I had the same problem, but in my case none of this helped. In my situation every WPF project I had (including newly made projects) stopped compiling with this error. Eventually I uninstalled all the .Net frameworks then reinstalled them and things started working again. I also did a reinstall of Visual Studio, but it turned out that had no affect. I had the same problem, expect I coped my MainWindow xaml and cs into a new file and then copied them back to their original place. I then got this error after trying to compile the WPF app.What I did to fix this error was rename the namespace (from egNamespace -> egNamespaceNew, and it worked again. I then changed the namespace back to the original one.I had the same issue, I had to convert my shared project into a portable class library.Right click on folder in project to create new UserControl that was the problem for me.\nI created the same control out side the folder and that was it.I just encountered this problem, and it turned out to be that my project is stored in my user folder, which is stored on the network, and we had a momentary network outage.  I did a build; it complained that my files had been modified outside the editor (they hadn\'t; the file locks just got borked), and it built fine, removing the error regarding the InitializeComponent() method.BTW, in case you\'re wondering, developing something from a network drive is bad practice.  It becomes particularly problematic when you\'re trying to leverage .NET\'s managed code; in my experience, it freaks out every time you build.  I forgot to put this little throw-away project in the proper folder, and ended up paying the price.For those who find this on the internet. Check the Windows.csproj file if the compilation is there. There should be 2 entriesAnother possible explanation is that you\'re building against x86. Right-click your Solution and choose Configuration Manager. See if you\'re building against x86 instead of Any CPU.
