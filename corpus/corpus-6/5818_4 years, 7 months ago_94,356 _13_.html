I have a watch function in my AngularJS application.However, after some condition (in my example, changing the page at my single-page application) I want to stop that watch (as like clearing timeout).How can I do that?$watch returns a deregistration function. Calling it would deregister the $watcher.scope.$watch returns a function that you can call and that will unregister the watch.Something like:You can also clear the watch inside the callback if you want to clear it right after something happens. That way your $watch will stay active until used.Like so...Some time your $watch is calling dynamically and it will create its instances so you have to call deregistration function before your $watch function If you have too much watchers and you need to clear all of them, you can push them into an array and destroy every $watch in a loop.Ideally, every custom watch should be removed when you leave the scope.It helps in better memory management and better app performance.For discarding the copy of watchers, you can use this:
