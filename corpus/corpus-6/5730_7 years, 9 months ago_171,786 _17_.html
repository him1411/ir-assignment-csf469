I start a background process from my shell script, and I would like to kill this process when my script finishes.How to get the PID of this process from my shell script? As far as I can see variable $! contains the PID of the current script, not the background process.You need to save the PID of the background process at the time you start it:You cannot use job control, since that is an interactive feature and tied to a controlling terminal. A script will not necessarily have a terminal attached at all so job control will not necessarily be available.You can use the jobs -l command to get to a particular jobLIn this case, 46841 is the PID.From help jobs:-l   Report the process group ID and working directory of the jobs.jobs -p is another option which shows just the PIDs.Here\'s a sample transcript from a bash session (%1 refers to the ordinal number of background process as seen from jobs):An even simpler way to kill all child process of a bash script:The -P flag works the same way with pkill and pgrep - it gets child processes, only with pkill the child processes get killed and with pgrep child PIDs are printed to stdout.this is what I have done. Check it out, hope it can help.Then just run it as: ./bgkill.sh with proper permissions of courseYou might also be able to use pstree:This typically gives a text representation of all the processes for the "user" and the -p option gives the process-id. It does not depend, as far as I understand, on having the processes be owned by the current shell. It also shows forks. pgrep can get you all of the child PIDs of a parent process.  As mentioned earlier $$ is the current scripts PID.  So, if you want a script that cleans up after itself, this should do the trick:
