I would like to know if there is a way for reading the Phone Model Programmatically in android.I would like to get a string like HTC Dream, Milestone, Sapphire or whatever...Thanks :)On many popular devices the market name of the device is not available. For example, on the Samsung Galaxy S6 the value of Build.MODEL could be "SM-G920F", "SM-G920I", or "SM-G920W8".I created a small library that gets the market (consumer friendly) name of a device. It gets the correct name for over 10,000 devices and is constantly updated. If you wish to use my library click the link below:If you do not want to use the library above, then this is the best solution for getting a consumer friendly device name:Example from my Verizon HTC One M8:Result:HTC6525LVW HTC One (M8)I use the following code to get the full device name. It gets model and manufacturer strings and concatenates them unless model string already contains manufacturer name (on some phones it does):Â     Here are a few examples of device names I got from the users:Samsung GT-S5830L\n  Motorola MB860\n  Sony Ericsson LT18i\n  LGE LG-P500\n  HTC Desire V\n  HTC Wildfire S A510e\n  \xe2\x80\xa6Yes: Build.MODEL.Actually that is not 100% correct.  That can give you Model (sometime numbers).\nWill get you the Manufacturer of the phone (HTC portion of your request):For a product name:Apparently you need to use the list from Google at https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1727131The APIs don\'t return anything I expect or anything in Settings. For my Motorola X this is what I get Going to the page mentioned above "ghost" maps to Moto X. Seems like this could be a tad simpler...you can use the following code for getting the brand name and\nbrand model of the device.The following strings are all of use when you want to retrieve manufacturer, name of the device, and/or the model:For whom who looking for full list of properties of Build here is an example for Sony Z1 Compact:You can easily list those properties for your device in debug mode using "evaluate expression" dialog using kotlin:String deviceName = android.os.Build.MODEL; // returns model name String deviceManufacturer = android.os.Build.MANUFACTURER; // returns manufacturerHere is my code , To get Manufacturer,Brand name,Os version and support API Level  Output:Changed Idolons code a little.  This will capitalize words when getting the device model.
