Is there a way to do a git pull that ignores any local file changes without blowing the directory away and having to perform a git clone?If you mean you want the pull to overwrite local changes, doing the merge as if the working tree were clean, well, clean the working tree:If there are untracked local files you could use git clean to remove them. Use git clean -f to remove untracked files, -df to remove untracked files and directories, and -xdf to remove untracked or ignored files or directories.If on the other hand you want to keep the local modifications somehow, you\'d use stash to hide them away before pulling, then reapply them afterwards:I don\'t think it makes any sense to literally ignore the changes, though - half of pull is merge, and it needs to merge the committed versions of content with the versions it fetched.For me the following worked:(1) First fetch all changes:(2) Then reset the master:(3) Pull/update:The command bellow wont work always. If you do just:and so on...To really start over, downloading thebranch and overwriting all your local changes, just do:This will work just fine.Look at git stash to put all of your local changes into a "stash file" and revert to the last commit. At that point, you can apply your stashed changes, or discard them.If you are on Linux:The for loop will delete all tracked files which are changed in the local repo, so git pull will work without any problems.\nThe nicest thing about this is that only the tracked files will be overwritten by the files in the repo, all other files will be left untouched.This will fetch the current branch and attempt to do a fast forward to master:
