How do you convert Unix epoch time into real time in C#? (Epoch beginning 1/1/1970)I presume that you mean Unix time, which is defined as the number of seconds since midnight (UTC) on 1st January 1970.With all credit to LukeH, I\'ve put together some extension methods for easy use:Note the comment below from CodesInChaos that the above FromUnixTime returns a DateTime with a Kind of Utc, which is fine, but the above ToUnixTime is much more suspect in that doesn\'t account for what kind of DateTime the given date is. To allow for date\'s Kind being either Utc or Local, use ToUniversalTime:ToUniversalTime will convert a Local (or Unspecified) DateTime to Utc.if you dont want to create the epoch DateTime instance when moving from DateTime to epoch you can also do:  The latest version of .Net (v4.6) just added built-in support for Unix time conversions. That includes both to and from Unix time represented by either seconds or milliseconds.Note: These methods convert to and from DateTimeOffset. To get a DateTime representation simply use the DateTimeOffset.DateTime property:You actually want to AddMilliseconds(milliseconds), not seconds. Adding seconds will give you an out of range exception. Should use ToUniversalTime() for the DateTime object.I use following extension methods for epoch conversion In case you need to convert a timeval struct (seconds, microseconds) containing UNIX time to DateTime without losing precision, this is how:If you are not using 4.6, this may help Source: System.IdentityModel.TokensHere is my solution:
