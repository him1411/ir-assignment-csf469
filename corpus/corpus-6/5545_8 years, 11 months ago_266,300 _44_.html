I want to know if my server is running Subversion 1.5.How can I find that out?Also would be nice to know my SVN client version number. svn help hasn\'t been helpful.Note: I don\'t want my project\'s revision number, etc. This question is about the Subversion software itself.To find the version of the subversion REPOSITORY you can:If not displayed, view source of the pageNow for the subversion CLIENT:will sufficeLet\'s merge these responses:From an earlier answer by Manuel, run the following on the SVN server:See the "powered by Subversion" line when accessing the server via a browser.Access the repository via browser and then look for the version string embedded in the HTML source. From earlier answers by elviejo and jaredjacobs. Similarly, from ??, use your browser\'s developer tools (usually Ctrl + Shift + I) to read the full response. This is also the easiest (non-automated) way to deal with certificates and authorization - your browser does it for you.Check the response tags (these are not shown in the HTML source), from an earlier answer by ChristopherFrom an earlier answer by MilenFrom an earlier answer by GlennPlease edit to finish this answerOn the server:  svnserve --versionin case of svnserve-based configuration (svn:// and svn+xxx://).(For completeness).Here\'s the simplest way to get the SVN server version. HTTP works even if your SVN repository requires HTTPS.For an HTTP-based server there is a Python script to find the server version at:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/tools/client-side/server-version.pyYou can get the client version withIf the Subversion server version is not printed in the HTML listing, it is available in the HTTP RESPONSE header returned by the server. You can get it using this shell commandIf the SVN server requires you provide a user name and password, then add the wget parameters --user and --password to the command like thisOne more option: If you have Firefox (I am using 14.0.1) and a SVN web interface:There should be an "SVN/1.7.4" string or similar there.  Again, this will probably only work if you have "ServerTokens Full" as mentioned above.There really isn\'t an easy way to find out what version of Subversion your server is running -- except to get onto the server and see for yourself.However, this may not be as big a problem as you may think. Subversion clients is were much of the grunt work is handled, and most versions of the Subversion clients can work with almost any version of the server.The last release where the server version really made a difference to the client was the change from release 1.4 to release 1.5 when merge tracking was added. Merge tracking had been greatly improved in version 1.6, but that doesn\'t really affect the interactions between the client and server.Let\'s take the latest changes in Subversion 1.8:Of all the features, only one depends upon the version of the server being 1.5 or greater (and 1.4 has been obsolete for quite a while. The newer features of 1.8 will improve performance of your working copy, but the server being at revision 1.8 isn\'t necessary. You\'re much more affected by your client version than your server version.I know this isn\'t the answer you wanted (no official way to see the server version), but fortunately the server version doesn\'t really affect you that much.Try this:I hope it helps.For a svn+ssh configuration, use ssh to run svnserve --version on the host machine:$ ssh user@host svnserve --versionIt is necessary to run the svnserve command on the machine that is actually serving as the server.Just use a web browser to go to the SVN address. Check the source code (Ctrl + U). Then you will find something like in the HTML code:Browse the repository with Firefox and inspect the element with Firebug. Under the NET tab, you can check the Header of the page. It will have something like:For Subversion 1.7 and above, the server doesn\'t provide a footer that indicates the server version.  But you can run the following command to gain the version from the response headersNote that this also works on Subversion servers where you don\'t have authorization to access.You can connect to your Subversion server using HTTP and find the version number in the HTTP header.A repository is not automatically updated unless the administrator runs \'svnadmin upgrade\'. To be sure of the version number of the repository, check the \'format\' file. See @bdumitriu\'s comment.The following on the command line should give you the version number
