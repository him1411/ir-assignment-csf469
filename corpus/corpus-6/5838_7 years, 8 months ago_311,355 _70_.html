I\'m using an horizontal progress bar in my Android application, and I want to change its progress color (which is Yellow by default). How can I do it using code (not XML)?I\'m sorry that it\'s not the answer, but what\'s driving the requirement setting it from code ?\nAnd .setProgressDrawable should work if it\'s defined correctly For a horizontal ProgressBar, you can use a ColorFilter, too, like this:If progressBar is indeterminate then use getIndeterminateDrawable() instead of getProgressDrawable().Since Lollipop (API 21) you can set a progress tint:For my indeterminate progressbar (spinner) I just set a color filter on the drawable. Works great and just one line. Example where setting color to red:This is not programmatically but i think it could help a lot of people anyway!\nI tried a lot and the most efficient way was to add this lines to my ProgressBar in the .xml File:So in the end this code did it for me:This solution works for API 21+This is an old question, but using theme is not mentioned here. If your default theme is using AppCompat, your ProgressBar\'s color will be colorAccent you have defined. Changing colorAccent will also change your ProgressBar\'s color, but there changes also reflects at multiple places. So, if you want a different color just for a specific PregressBar you can do that by applying theme to that ProgressBar :Extend your default theme and override colorAccentAnd in ProgressBar add the android:theme attribute:So it will look something like this:So you are just changing a colorAccent for your particular ProgressBar.Note: Using style will not work. You need to use android:theme only.\nYou can find more use of theme here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AndroidDevelopers/posts/JXHKyhsWHAHas per some of the suggestions, you CAN specify a shape and clipdrawable with a colour, then set it.  I have this working programatically.  This is how I do it..First make sure you import the drawable library..import android.graphics.drawable.*;Then use the code similar to below;Hit the same problem while working on modifying the look/feel of the default progress bar. Here is some more info that will hopefully help people :)if Indeterminate:Nowadays in 2016 I found some pre-Lollipop devices don\'t honour the colorAccent setting, so my final solution for all APIs is now the following:For bonus points, it doesn\'t use any deprecated code. Try it!There\'s probably one thing that hasn\'t been referred to in this answer:If your theme is inheriting from Theme.AppCompat, ProgressBar will assume the color you defined as "colorAccent" in your theme.So, using..<item name="colorAccent">@color/custom_color</item>..will tint the color of the ProgressBar automagically to the @color/custom_color .How I did it in horizontal ProgressBar:One more little thing, the theme solution does work if you inherit a base theme, so for app compact your theme should be:And then set this in the progress bar themeThis worked for me :This solution worked for me :For a horizontal style ProgressBar I use:An example call would be:If you don\'t need the \'secondary progress\' simply set value2 to value1.Posted to add info about PaulieG\'s answer, since ateiob asked me to explain something...Unfortunately when I proposed an edit to the solution, it was a long time ago, and I can\'t remember all the details. I can say that there is (or at least was, at the time of writing when I looked at that current version of Android source code) a bug/issue/optimisation in the ProgressBar code that ignores an attempt to set the progress to a value it is already at. After calling ProgressBar.setProgressDrawable(), your progress bar will be blank (because you changed the drawable part).This means you need to set the progress, and redraw it. But if you just set the progress to a preserved value, it will do nothing.You must set it to 0 first, then to the "old" value again, and the bar will redraw.So to summarise: Below is a method I have that does this - I hope it is useful. I\'m not 100% sure why I called it from onResume() - this might be important, or unrelated:As far as HappyEngineer\'s solution, I think it was a similar workaround, to manually set the "progress" offset (I do not remember exactly). In either case, the above code should work for you.Sorry if I can\'t remember all of the details - that is why I attempted to edit the answer. Hope this helps...This helped me to set a custom color to progressbar through code. Hope it helpsApply this custom style to the progress bar.@drawable/progress.xml -Use this type of image for progress bar.\nFor better result you can use multiple progress images. And please don\'t hesitate using images, because Android Platform itself use images for progressbar.\nThe code is extracted from sdk :)As per muhammad-adil suggested \nfor SDK ver 21 and abovein XML Works for me, is easy enough.Horizontal ProgressBar uses rectangle shape drawable for background, ClipDrawable constructed from rectangle shape for progresses (primary & secondary). Tinting changes colors to some tint. If you want targeted colors for all three separately then you can use ProgressBar.setProgressDrawable() as following:Note that order of drawable layers is important while initializing LayerDrawable. First drawable should be for background. As per my experiment switching ids does not work. If you set padding to progressbar then this approach will not work. If you need padding then you can use a container for the progressbar such as a LinearLayout.It is so simple using attr , if you are dealing with multistyle apps:try this way:Declare below attribute attrs.xmlPaste below code in styles.xmluse progress bar like belowHere is the code for changing the color of ProgressBar by programatically.Horizontal progress bar custom material style :To change color of background and progress of horizontal progress bar.Apply it to progress bar by setting style attribute, for custom material styles and custom progress bar check http://www.zoftino.com/android-progressbar-and-custom-progressbar-examplesThis worked for me and is an easy solution.
