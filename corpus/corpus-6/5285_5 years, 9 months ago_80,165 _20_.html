Since AVD tools 16 I\'m getting this warning:in my strings.xmlat this lineHow do I replace ... is it just literally: &#8230;If someone could explain this encoding please?&#8230; is the unicode for "â€¦" so just replace it. It\'s better to have it as one char/symbol than three dots.To make thing short just put &#x2026; in place ...Link to XML character Entities ListIf you\'re using Eclipse then you can always do the following:This should replace your three dots with the proper Unicode character for ellipsis.Just a note: The latest version of ADT (21.1) sometimes won\'t do the replace operation properly, but earlier versions had no problem doing this.This is the character: \xe2\x80\xa6The solution to your problem is:And search for "ellipsis".  Change the warning level to "Info" or "Ignore".This answer is indirectly related to this question:In my case textView1.setTextView("done&#8230"); was showing some box/chinese character. Later, I checked into fileformat.info for what the value represents and I found this is a Han character.\nSo, what to do? I searched for "fileformat.info ellipse character" and then everything became clear to me once I saw its values are;UTF-16 (hex)   0x2026 (2026)UTF-16 (decimal)   8,230So, you have several encoding available to represent a character (e.g. 10 in Decimal is represented as A in hexa) so it is very important to know when you are writing an unicode character, how receiving function decodes it. If it decodes as decimal value then you have to provide decimal value, if it accept hexadecimal then you have to provide hexadecimal.In my case, setTextView() function accepts decimal encoded value but I was providing hexadecimal values so I was getting wrong character.
