This looks like a really common task, but I can\'t find an easy way to do it. I want to undo the last applied migration. I would have expected a simple command, like Instead, all I can come up with is:(At least I can use just the name, skipping the timestamp...)Is there an easier way?As of EF 5.0, the approach you describe is the preferred way. One solution would be to create a wrapper PS script that automates the steps above. Additionally, feel free to create a feature request for this, or better yet, take a shot at implementing it! http://entityframework.codeplex.com/I want to add some clarification to this thread: What you are doing above is saying that you want to rollback all migrations UNTIL you\'re left with the migration specified. Thus, if you use GET-MIGRATIONS and you find that you have A, B, C, D, and E, then using this command will rollback E and D to get you to C:Also, unless anyone can comment to the contrary, I noticed that you can use an ordinal value and the short -Target switch (thus, -Target is the same as -TargetMigration). If you want to rollback all migrations and start over, you can use:0, above, would rollback even the FIRST migration (this is a destructive command--be sure you know what you\'re doing before you use it!)--something you cannot do if you use the syntax above that requires the name of the target migration (the name of the 0th migration doesn\'t exist before a migration is applied!). So in that case, you have to use the 0 (ordinal) value. Likewise, if you have applied migrations A, B, C, D, and E (in that order), then the ordinal 1 should refer to A, ordinal 2 should refer to B, and so on. So to rollback to B you could use either:orIn EntityFrameworkCore:where 20161012160749_AddedOrderToCourse is a name of migration you want to rollback to.The solution is:
