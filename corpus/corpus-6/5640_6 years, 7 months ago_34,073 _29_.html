I switched from Subversion to Git as my day-to-day VCS last year and am still trying to grasp the finer points of "Git-think".The one which has been bothering me lately is "lightweight" vs. annotated vs. signed tags.  It seems pretty universally accepted that annotated tags are superior to lightweight tags for all real uses, but the explanations I\'ve found for why that\'s the case always seem to boil down to either "because best practices" or "because they\'re different".  Unfortunately, those are very unsatisfying arguments without knowing why it\'s best practices or how those differences are relevant to my Git usage.When I first switched to Git, lightweight tags seemed to be the best thing since sliced bread; I could just point at a commit and say "that was 1.0".  I\'m having trouble grasping how a tag could ever need to be more than that, but I certainly can\'t believe that the Git experts of the world prefer annotated tags arbitrarily!  So what\'s all the hubbub about?(Bonus points: Why would I ever need to sign a tag?)EDITI\'ve been successfully convinced that annotated tags are a Good Thing \xe2\x80\x94 knowing who tagged and when is important!  As a follow-up, any advice on good tag annotations?  Both git tag -am "tagging 1.0" 1.0 and trying to summarize the commit log since the previous tag feel like losing strategies.The big plus of an annotated tag is that you know who created it. Just like with commits, sometimes it\'s nice to know who did it. If you\'re a developer and you see that v1.7.4 has been tagged (declared ready) and you\'re not so sure, who do you talk to? The person whose name is in the annotated tag! (If you live in a distrustful world, this also keeps people from getting away with tagging things they shouldn\'t.) If you\'re a consumer, that name is a stamp of authority: that\'s Junio Hamano saying this version of git is hereby released.The other metadata can be helpful too - sometimes it\'s nice to know when that version was released, not just when the final commit was made. And sometimes the message can even be useful. Maybe it helps explain the purpose of that particular tag. Maybe the tag for a release candidate contains a bit of a status/to-do list.Signing tags is pretty much like signing anything else - it provides one more level of security for the paranoid. Most of us aren\'t ever going to use it, but if you really want to verify everything before you put that software on your computer, you might want it.Edit:As for what to write in a tag annotation, you\'re right - there\'s not always much useful to say. For a version number tag, it\'s implicitly understood that it marks that version, and if you\'re happy with your changelogs elsewhere, there\'s no need to put one there. In this case, it\'s really the tagger and date that are the most important. The only other thing I can think of is some sort of stamp of approval from a test suite. Have a look at git.git\'s tags: they all just say something like "Git 1.7.3 rc1"; all we really care about is Junio Hamano\'s name on them.However, for less obviously named tags, the message could become much more important. I could envision tagging a specific special-purpose version for a single user/client, some important non-version milestone, or (as mentioned above) a release candidate with extra information. The message is then much more useful.My personal, slightly different view on that topic:By default, Git only looks at annotated tags as a baseline for commands like git describe. Think of annotated tags as signposts that have enduring meaning to yourself and others, while lightweight tags are more like bookmarks for your later self to find. Hence, annotated tags are worth using as a reference, while lightweight tags shouldn\'t be.Signing a tag is an assurance of the signer\'s identity. It lets users verify, for example, that the Linux kernel code they\'ve picked up is the same code that Linus Torvalds actually released. The signature can also be an assertion that the signer is vouching for the software\'s quality and integrity at that commit.Signing a tag is an easy way to assert the authenticity of a release.This is particularly useful in a DVCS because anyone can clone the repository and modify history (e.g. via git-filter-branch).  If a tag is signed, the signature will not survive a git-filter-branch operation, so if you have a policy that every release is tagged and signed by a committer, it\'s possible to detect a bogus release tag in the repository.If it weren\'t for signing, I wouldn\'t see much point in annotated tags either.Use annotated tags for publishing releases remotely, and unannotated locally (mentioned by Koraktor).Rationale:man git-tag says:Annotated tags are meant for release while lightweight tags are meant for private or temporary object labels.And certain behaviors do differentiate between them in ways that this recommendation is useful e.g.:See also:I\'ve found the one good use for lightweight tags - creating a release at GitHub in retrospective.We did release our software and we had the necessary commits, we just didn\'t bother to maintain the \'Release\' section on the GitHub. And when we gave that a little attention, we\'ve realised that we would want to add some previous releases too, with correct old release dates for them. If we would just create an annotated tag on an old commit, GitHub would take the date for the release from the tag object. In contrast, when we\'ve created a lightweight tag for this old commit, the release started showing the correct (old) date.\nSource @ GitHub help, \'About releases\'It seems it\'s also possible to specify your desired date for an annotated commit, but it doesn\'t look that simple to me:\nhttps://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html#_on_backdating_tagsIn my office we\'ll put the release webpage address in the tag body. The release webpage details all the different new features and fixes since the last release. Management won\'t be looking in the git repo to find out what changes happened, and it\'s nice to have a concise list of what\'s in that release.
