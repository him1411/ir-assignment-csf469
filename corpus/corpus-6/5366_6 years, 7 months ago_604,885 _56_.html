I have copied the sample.war file into the webapps directory of Tomcat, and I can access localhost:8080.Now how will Tomcat deploy it, I mean do I need to open it in browser? How can I access the application?You can access your application from: http://localhost:8080/sampleDeploying or redeploying of war files is automatic by default - after copying/overwriting the file sample.war, check your webapps folder for an extracted folder sample.If it doesn\'t open properly, check the log files (e.g. tomcat/logs/catalina.out) for problems with deployment.step-1. here I\'m deploying pos.war First go to tomcat webapps folder and paste it    step-2.  go to tomcat->bin folder  start tomcat by clicking startup.batstep-3. go to browser write localhost:port/project name eg. localhost:8080/pos (here my tomcat run on port 8080)Done....You just need to put your war file in webapps and then start your server.it will get deployed.otherwise you can also use tomcat manager a webfront to upload & deploy  your war remotely. Copy the .war file (E.g.: prj.war) to %CATALINA_HOME%\\webapps ( E.g.: C:\\tomcat\\webapps )Run %CATALINA_HOME%\\bin\\startup.batYour .war file will be extracted automatically to a folder that has the same name (without extension) (E.g.: prj)Go to %CATALINA_HOME%\\conf\\server.xml and take the port for the HTTP protocol. <Connector port="8080" ... />. The default value is 8080.Access the following URL: [<protocol>://]localhost:<port>/folder/resourceName(E.g.: localhost:8080/folder/resourceName)Don\'t try to access the URL without the resourceName because it won\'t work if there is no file like index.html, or if there is no url pattern like "/" or "/*" in web.xml.The available main paths are here: [<protocol>://]localhost:<port>/manager/html (E.g.: http://localhost:8080/manager/html) and they have true on the "Running" column.Go to [<protocol>://]localhost:<port>/manager/html/ (usually localhost:8080/manager/html/) This is also achievable from [<protocol>://]localhost:<port> > Manager App)If you get:403 Access Deniedgo to %CATALINA_HOME%\\conf\\tomcat-users.xml and check that you have enabled a line like this:In the Deploy section, WAR file to deploy subsection, click on Browse....Select the .war file (E.g.: prj.war) > click on Deploy.In addition to the ways already mentioned (dropping the war-file directly into the webapps-directory), if you have the Tomcat Manager -application installed, you can deploy war-files via browser too. To get to the manager, browse to the root of the server (in your case, localhost:8080), select "Tomcat Manager" (at this point, you need to know username and password for a Tomcat-user with "manager"-role, the users are defined in tomcat-users.xml in the conf-directory of the tomcat-installation). From the opening page, scroll downwards until you see the "Deploy"-part of the page, where you can click "browse" to select a WAR file to deploy from your local machine. After you\'ve selected the file, click deploy. After a while the manager should inform you that the application has been deployed (and if everything went well, started).Here\'s a longer how-to and other instructions from the Tomcat 7 documentation pages.This has been working for me:If you try uploading the new file as a war file, with tomcat still running, it will attempt to expand it before it is all there.  It will fail.  Having failed, it will not try again.  Thus, uploading a www file, then renaming it, allows the whole war file to be present before tomcat notices it.Hint, don\'t forget to check that the war file\'s owner is tomcat (Use chown)There are two ways:Just use tomcat manager console for console deployment or simply copy and paste your application in webapp folder of your server\'s tomcat_home directory.Note: Make sure if your war file size is more than 52 MB (the default configuration value),\nyou need to make two little changes in web.xml file of Manager application of your webapp folder(Manager application is provided by Apache tomcat by default upon installing the server).Go to the web.xml of the manager application (for instance it could\n    be under /tomcat7/webapps/manager/WEB-INF/web.xml.Increase the max-file-size and max-request-size values in web.xml file:<multipart-config>Increase the size by putting the values for <max-file-size> and <max-request-size> according to your requirement.If you installed tomcat7 using apt-get in linux then, deploy your app to /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/eg.Also, keep tailing the tomcat log so that you can verify that your app is actually making peace with tomcat.The deployed application should appear in http://172.16.35.155:8080/manager/html1.Generate a war file from your application \n2. open tomcat manager, go down the page\n3. Click on browse to deploy the war.\n4. choose your war file.\nThere you go!Perform the following steps:       I followed the instruction in the following link, it works for me.\nhttp://www.coderanch.com/t/487178/Tomcat/war-file-show-loadStop TomcatDelete all the logs in tomcat/logs and all files in tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhostRemove the war file and the directory it created (if it did) from tomact/webappsStart TomcatWhile watching the logs, copy the war file to the webapps directory againAfter this, keep an eye on the catalina.xxxx-xx-xx.log to find out the issue.
