If I omit the -Xmxn option from the java command line a default value is used. According to \njava documentation "the default value is chosen at runtime based on system configuration".What system configuration settings influence the default value?On Windows systems, you can use the following command to find out the defaults on the system where your applications runs. java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | findstr HeapSizeLook for the options MaxHeapSize (for -Xmx) and InitialHeapSize for -Xms.On a Unix/Linux system, you can dojava -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | grep HeapSizeI believe the resulting output is in bytes.According to Garbage Collector Ergonomics [Oracle]:initial heap size:Larger of 1/64th of the machine\'s physical memory on the machine or some\n  reasonable minimum. Before J2SE 5.0,\n  the default initial heap size was a\n  reasonable minimum, which varies by\n  platform. You can override this\n  default using the -Xms command-line\n  option.maximum heap size:Smaller of 1/4th of the physical memory or 1GB. Before J2SE 5.0, the\n  default maximum heap size was 64MB.\n  You can override this default using\n  the -Xmx command-line option.UPDATE:As pointed out by Tom Anderson in his comment, the above is for server-class machines. From Ergonomics in the 5.0 JavaTM Virtual Machine:In the J2SE platform version 5.0 a\n  class of machine referred to as a\n  server-class machine has been defined\n  as a machine withwith the exception of 32 bit platforms\n  running a version of the Windows\n  operating system. On all other\n  platforms the default values are the\n  same as the default values for version\n  1.4.2. In the J2SE platform version 1.4.2 by\n  default the following selections were\n  madeThis is changed with java 6 update 18. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/6u18-142093.htmlAssuming that we have more than 1gb of physical memory(quite common these days), it\'s always 1/4th of your physical memory.Ernesto is right.  According to the link he posted [1]:"Updated Client JVM heap configuration \nIn the Client JVM...\nThe default maximum heap size is half of the physical memory up to a physical memory size of 192 megabytes and otherwise one fourth of the physical memory up to a physical memory size of 1 gigabyte. For example, if your machine has 128 megabytes of physical memory, then the maximum heap size is 64 megabytes, and greater than or equal to 1 gigabyte of physical memory results in a maximum heap size of 256 megabytes.The maximum heap size is not actually used by the JVM unless your program creates enough objects to require it. A much smaller amount, termed the initial heap size, is allocated during JVM initialization. ...Server JVM heap configuration ergonomics are now the same as the Client, except that the default maximum heap size for 32-bit JVMs is 1 gigabyte, corresponding to a physical memory size of 4 gigabytes, and for 64-bit JVMs is 32 gigabytes, corresponding to a physical memory size of 128 gigabytes."[1] http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/6u18-142093.htmlfor IBM jvm the command is the following:For more information about IBM SDK for Java 8 - http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.lnx.80.doc/diag/appendixes/defaults.html?lang=endefault value is chosen at runtime based on system configurationHave a look at documentation pageDefault Heap SizeUnless the initial and maximum heap sizes are specified on the command line, they are calculated based on the amount of memory on the machine.Client JVM Default Initial and Maximum Heap Sizes:The default maximum heap size is half of the physical memory up to a physical memory size of 192 megabytes (MB) and otherwise one fourth of the physical memory up to a physical memory size of 1 gigabyte (GB).Server JVM Default Initial and Maximum Heap Sizes:On 32-bit JVMs, the default maximum heap size can be up to 1 GB if there is 4 GB or more of physical memory. On 64-bit JVMs, the default maximum heap size can be up to 32 GB if there is 128 GB or more of physical memoryWhat system configuration settings influence the default value?You can specify the initial and maximum heap sizes using the flags -Xms (initial heap size) and -Xmx (maximum heap size). If you know how much heap your application needs to work well, you can set -Xms and -Xmx to the same valueJava8 takes Larger of 1/6th of your physical memory for your Xmssize (Minimum HeapSize) and Smaller of 1/4th of your physical memory for your -Xmxsize (Maximum HeapSize).You can Check the default java Heap Size by:In Windows:In Linux:What system configuration settings influence the default value?Your physical memory and your Java version.
