I need to set some environment variables in the python script and I want all the other scripts that are called from python (shell scripts) which will be child process to see the environment variables set. The value is a number.If I do os.environ["DEBUSSY"] = 1, it complains saying that 1 has to be string.\nI also want to know how to read the environment variables in python (in the later part of the script) once I set it. Environment variables must be strings, so useto set the variable DEBUSSY to the string 1.  To access this variable later, simply useChild processes automatically inherit the environment of the parent process -- no special action on your part is required.You may need to consider some further aspects for code robustness;when you\'re storing an integer-valued variable as an environment variable, trythen for retrieval, consider that to avoid errors, you should trypossibly substitute \'-1\' for \'Not Set\'so, to put that all togetherif i do os.environ["DEBUSSY"] = 1, it\n  complains saying that 1 has to be\n  string.Then doI also want to know how to read the\n  environment variables in python(in the\n  later part of the script) once i set\n  it.Just use os.environ["DEBUSSY"], as inYou should assign string value to environment variable. os.environ["DEBUSSY"] = "1"If you want to read or print the environment variable just use  print os.environ["DEBUSSY"] This changes will be effective only for the current process where it was assigned, it will no change the value permanently. The child processes will automatically inherit the environment of the parent process.  What about os.environ["DEBUSSY"] = \'1\'? Environment variables are always strings.You can use the os.environ dictionary to access your environment variables. Now, a problem I had is that if I tried to use os.system to run a batch file that sets your environment variables (using the SET command in a **.bat* file) it would not really set them for your python environment (but for the child process that is created with the os.system function). To actually get the variables set in the python environment, I use this script:When you play with environment variables (add/modify/remove variables), a good practice is to restore the previous state at function completion.You may need something like the modified_environ context manager describe in this question to restore the environment variables.Classic usage:os.environ behaves like a python dictionary, so all the common dictionary operations can be performed. In addition to the get and set operations mentioned in the other answers, we can also simply check if a key exists:I had run into an issue recently and figured out, if you have other scripts updating the environment while your python script is running, calling os.environ again will not reflect the latest values.Excerpt from the docs:This mapping is captured the first time the os module is imported,\n  typically during Python startup as part of processing site.py. Changes\n  to the environment made after this time are not reflected in\n  os.environ, except for changes made by modifying os.environ directly.os.environ.data which stores all the environment variables, is a dict object, which contains all the environment values:
