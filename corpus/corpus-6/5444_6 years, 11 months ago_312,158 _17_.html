What is the best way to have a enum type represent a set of strings?I tried this:How can I then use them as Strings?I don\'t know what you want to do, but this is how I actually translated your example code....Alternatively, you can create a getter method for text.You can now do Strings.STRING_ONE.toString();Custom String Values for Enumfrom http://javahowto.blogspot.com/2006/10/custom-string-values-for-enum.htmlThe default string value for java enum is its face value, or the element name. However, you can customize the string value by overriding toString() method. For example,Running the following test code will produce this:Use its name() method:yields ONE.Depending on what you mean by "use them as Strings", you might not want to use an enum here. In most cases, the solution proposed by The Elite Gentleman will allow you to use them through their toString-methods, e.g. in System.out.println(STRING_ONE) or String s = "Hello "+STRING_TWO, but when you really need Strings (e.g. STRING_ONE.toLowerCase()), you might prefer defining them as constants:Either set the enum name to be the same as the string you want or, more generally,you can associate arbitrary attributes with your enum values:It\'s important to have the constants at the top, and the methods/attributes at the bottom.If you do not want to use constructors, and you want to have a special name for the method, try it this:I suspect that this is the quickest solution. There is no need to use variables final.
