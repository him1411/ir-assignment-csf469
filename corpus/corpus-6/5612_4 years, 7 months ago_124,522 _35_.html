All of my records have a field called "pictures". This field is an array of strings.I now want the newest 10 records where this array IS NOT empty.I\'ve googled around, but strangely enough I haven\'t found much on this.\nI\'ve read into the $where option, but I was wondering how slow that is to native functions, and if there is a better solution.And even then, that does not work:Returns nothing. Leaving this.pictures without the length bit does work, but then it also returns empty records, of course.If you also have documents that don\'t have the key, you can use:MongoDB don\'t use indexes if $size is involved, so here is a better solution:[edit] Also, since MongoDB 2.6 release, you can compare with the operator $gt:After some more looking, especially in the mongodb documents, and puzzling bits together, this was the answer:This might also work for you:Starting with the 2.6 release, another way to do this is to compare the field to an empty array:Testing it out in the shell:So it properly includes the docs where pictures has at least one array element, and excludes the docs where pictures is either an empty array, not an array, or missing.You care about two things when querying - accuracy and performance. With that in mind, I tested a few different approaches in MongoDB v3.0.14.TL;DR db.doc.find({ nums: { $gt: -Infinity }}) is the fastest and most reliable (at least in the MongoDB version I tested).I inserted 1k docs w/o a list field, 1k docs with an empty list, and 5 docs with a non-empty list.I recognize this isn\'t enough of a scale to take performance as seriously as I am in the tests below, but it\'s enough to present the correctness of various queries and behavior of chosen query plans.db.doc.find({\'nums\': {\'$exists\': true}}) returns wrong results (for what we\'re trying to accomplish).--db.doc.find({\'nums.0\': {\'$exists\': true}}) returns correct results, but it\'s also slow using a full collection scan (notice COLLSCAN stage in the explanation).--db.doc.find({\'nums\': { $exists: true, $gt: { \'$size\': 0 }}}) returns wrong results. That\'s because of an invalid index scan advancing no documents. It will likely be accurate but slow without the index.--db.doc.find({\'nums\': { $exists: true, $not: { \'$size\': 0 }}}) returns correct results, but the performance is bad. It technically does an index scan, but then it still advances all the docs and then has to filter through them).--db.doc.find({\'nums\': { $exists: true, $ne: [] }}) returns correct results and is slightly faster, but the performance is still not ideal. It uses IXSCAN which only advances docs with an existing list field, but then has to filter out the empty lists one by one.--db.doc.find({\'nums\': { $gt: [] }}) IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE DEPENDING ON THE INDEX USED IT MIGHT GIVE UNEXPECTED RESULTS. That\'s because of an invalid index scan which advances no documents.--db.doc.find({\'nums.0\xe2\x80\x99: { $gt: -Infinity }}) returns correct results, but has bad performance (uses a full collection scan).--db.doc.find({\'nums\': { $gt: -Infinity }}) surprisingly, this works very well! It gives the right results and it\'s fast, advancing 5 docs from the index scan phase.You can use any of the following to achieve this.\nBoth also take care of not returning a result for objects that don\'t have the requested key in them:You can also use the helper method Exists over the Mongo operator $existsSimple as that, this worked for me.
