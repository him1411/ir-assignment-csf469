I was hoping someone can help me out. I have a file upload object on my page: with the following excel files on my desktop:I want the file upload to ONLY show .xlsx, .xls, & .csv files. Using the accept attribute, I found these content-types took care of .xlsx & .xls extensions... accept= application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet (.XLSX)accept= application/vnd.ms-excel (.XLS)However, I cannot find the correct content-type for an Excel CSV file! Any suggestions? EXAMPLE: http://jsfiddle.net/LzLcZ/Well this is embarrassing... I found the solution I was looking for and it couldn\'t be simpler. I used the following code to get the desired result. Hope this helps someone in the future.  Thanks everyone for your help.For CSV files (.csv), use: For Excel Files 97-2003 (.xls), use: For Excel Files 2007+ (.xlsx), use: For Text Files (.txt) use: For Image Files (.png/.jpg/etc), use: For HTML Files (.htm,.html), use:For Video Files (.avi, .mpg, .mpeg, .mp4), use:For Audio Files (.mp3, .wav, etc), use:For PDF Files, use:DEMO:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/dirtyd77/LzLcZ/144/NOTE: If you are trying to display Excel CSV files (.csv), do NOT use:If you are trying to display a particular file type (for example, a WAV or PDF), then this will almost always work...Dom this attribute is very old and not accepted in modern browsers as far as I know, But here is an alternative to it, Try thisI guess it\'ll help you of course you can change this script according to your needs.I have used text/comma-separated-values for CSV mime-type in accept attribute and it works fine in Opera. Tried text/csv without luck.Some others MIME-Types for CSV if the suggested do not work: Source: http://filext.com/file-extension/CSVYou can know the correct content-type for any file by just doing the following:1) Select interested file, 2) And run in console this:You can also set attribute "multiple" for your input to check content-type for several files at a time and do next:Attribute accept has some problems with multiple attribute and doesn\'t work correctly in this case.This didn\'t work for me under Safari 10:I had to write this instead:I have modified the solution of @yogi. The addition is that when the file is of incorrect format I reset the input element value.I have custom verification buildin, because in open file window the user can still choose the options "All files (\'*\')", regardless if I explicitly set the accept attribute in input element.  Now you can use new html5 input validation attribute pattern=".+\\.(xlsx|xls|csv)".using regex would be quickerThese days you can just use the file extension
