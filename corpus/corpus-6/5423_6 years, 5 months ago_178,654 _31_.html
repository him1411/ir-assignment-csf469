What\'s the "best" way to convert a number to a string (in terms of speed advantage, clarity advantage, memory advantage, etc) ?Some examples:String(n)n.toString()""+nn+""like this:Actually, even though I typically do it like this for simple convenience, over 1,000s of iterations it appears for raw speed there is an advantage for .toString()See Performance tests here (not by me, but found when I went to write my own):\nhttp://jsben.ch/#/ghQYRFastest based on the JSPerf test above: str = num.toString();It should be noted that the difference in speed is not overly significant when you consider that it can do the conversion any way 1 Million times in 0.1 seconds.Update: The speed seems to differ greatly by browser.  In Chrome num + \'\' seems to be fastest based on this test http://jsben.ch/#/ghQYRUpdate 2: Again based on my test above it should be noted that Firefox 20.0.1 executes the .toString() about 100 times slower than the \'\' + num sample.In my opinion n.toString() takes the prize for its clarity, and I don\'t think it carries any extra overhead. Explicit conversions are very clear to someone that\'s new to the language.  Using type coercion, as others have suggested, leads to ambiguity if a developer is not aware of the coercion rules.  Ultimately developer time is more costly than CPU time, so I\'d optimize for the former at the cost of the latter.  That being said, in this case the difference is likely negligible, but if not I\'m sure there are some decent JavaScript compressors that will optimize this sort of thing.So, for the above reasons I\'d go with: n.toString() or String(n).  String(n) is probably a better choice because it won\'t fail if n is null or undefined.The simplest way to convert any variable to a string is to add an empty string to that variable.  SourceTongue-in-cheek obviously:Or in ES6 you could simply use template strings:If you need to to format the result to a specific number of decimal places, for example to represent currency, you need something like the toFixed() method.digits is the number of digits to display after the decimal place.I like the first two since they\'re easier to read. I tend to use String(n) but it is just a matter of style than anything else.That is unless you have a line aswhich is very self explanatoryIf I had to take everything into consideration, I will suggest following   IMHO, its the fastest way to convert to string. Correct me if I am wrong.I think it depends on the situation but anyway you can use the .toString() method as it is very clear to understand.If you are curious as to which is the most performant check this out where I compare all the different Number -> String conversions.Looks like 2+\'\' or 2+"" are the fastest.https://jsperf.com/int-2-string
