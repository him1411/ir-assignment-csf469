I\'m trying to check if value is in a map and somewhat can\'t do it:so how can I print what is in p?Use map::findTo check if a particular key in the map exists, use the count member function in one of the following ways:The documentation for map::find says: "Another member function, map::count, can be used to just check whether a particular key exists."The documentation for map::count says: "Because all elements in a map container are unique, the function can only return 1 (if the element is found) or zero (otherwise)."To retrieve a value from the map via a key that you know to exist, use map::at:Unlike map::operator[], map::at will not create a new key in the map if the specified key does not exist.You can use .find():If you want to use other API, then find go for m.count(c)>0I think you want map::find. If m.find("f") is equal to m.end(), then the key was not found. Otherwise, find returns an iterator pointing at the element found.The error is because p.first is an iterator, which doesn\'t work for stream insertion. Change your last line to cout << (p.first)->first;. p is a pair of iterators, p.first is an iterator, p.first->first is the key string.A map can only ever have one element for a given key, so equal_range isn\'t very useful. It\'s defined for map, because it\'s defined for all associative containers, but it\'s a lot more interesting for multimap.Be careful in comparing the find result with the the end like for map \'m\' as all answer have \ndone above\n     map::iterator i = m.find("f");you should not try and perform any operation such as printing the key or value with iterator i if its equal to m.end() else it will lead to segmentation fault. check key exist or not, and return number of occurs(0/1 in map):\ncheck key exist or not, and return iterator:\nin your question, the error caused by bad operator<< overload, because p.first is map<string, string>, you can not print it out. try this:\nOf course if you wanted to get fancier you could always template out a function that also took a found function and a not found function, something like this:And use it like this:The downside to this is coming up with a good name, "find_and_execute" is awkward and I can\'t come up with anything better off the top of my head...Comparing the code of std::map::find and std::map::count, I\'d say the first may yield some performance advantage:If you want to compare pair of map you can use this method:This is a useful technique.
