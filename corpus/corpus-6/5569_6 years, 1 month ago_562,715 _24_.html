Why am I getting an error doing an insert when IDENTITY_INSERT is set to OFF?  How do I turn it on properly in SQL Server 2008? Is it by using SQL Server Management Studio?I have run this query:Then I got the message back in the console that the Command(s) completed successfully.\nHowever when I run the application, it still gives me the error shown below:Via SQL as per MSDNThe complete error message tells you exactly what is wrong...Cannot insert explicit value for identity column in table \'sometableWithIdentity\' when IDENTITY_INSERT is set to OFF.I had a problem where it did not allow me to insert it even after setting the IDENTITY_INSERT ON.The problem was that i did not specify the column names and for some reason it did not like it.

That is why he got the below Error:It looks nevessary to put a SET IDENTITY_INSERT Database. dbo. Baskets ON; before every SQL INSERT sending batch. /You can send several INSERT ... VALUES .. commands started with one SET IDENTITY_INSERT ... ON; string at the beginning. Just don\'t put any batch separator between/\nI don\'t know why the SET IDENTITY_INSERT ... ON stops working, after the sending block (for ex.: .ExecuteNonQuery() in c#)... I had to put SET IDENTITY_INSERT ... ON; again at the beginning of next SQL command string.You need to add the command \'go\' after you set the identity insert.\nExample:
