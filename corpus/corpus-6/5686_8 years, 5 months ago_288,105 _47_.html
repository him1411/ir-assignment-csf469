Are there any canned Python methods to convert an Integer (or Long) into a binary string in Python?There are a myriad of dec2bin() functions out on Google... But I was hoping I could use a built-in function / library.Python\'s string format method can take a format spec. Format spec docs for Python 2 Format spec docs for Python 3If you\'re looking for bin() as an equivalent to hex(), it was added in python 2.6.Example:No language or library will give its user base everything that they desire. If you\'re working in an envronment that doesn\'t provide exactly what you need, you should be collecting snippets of code as you develop to ensure you never have to write the same thing twice. Such as, for example:which will construct your binary string based on the decimal value.Fortunately, however, Python has something already built in, the ability to do operations such as \'{0:b}\'.format(42), which will give you the bit pattern for 42, or 101010.The general idea is to use code from (in order of preference):As a reference:This function can convert a positive integer as large as 18446744073709551615, represented as string \'1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\'.It can be modified to serve a much larger integer, though it may not be as handy as "{0:b}".format() or bin().If you want a textual representation without the 0b-prefix, you could use this:When you want a n-bit representation:Alternatively, if you prefer having a function:one-liner with lambda:test:\nEDIT: but then :( in compare to A simple way to do that is to use string format, see this page.And if you want to have a fixed length of the binary string, you can use this:If two\'s complement is required, then the following line can be used:where n is the width of the binary string.Summary of alternatives:Contributors include John Fouhy, Tung Nguyen, mVChr, Martin Thoma. and Martijn Pieters.Unless I\'m misunderstanding what you mean by binary string I think the module you are looking for is structUsing numpy pack/unpackbits, they are your best friends.Yet another solution with another algorithm, by using bitwise operators.    A faster version without reversing the string.output:1010Here is the code I\'ve just implemented. This is not a method but you can use it as a ready-to-use function!here is simple solution using the divmod() fucntion which returns the reminder and the result of a division without the fraction.Somewhat similar solutionHere\'s yet another way using regular math, no loops, only recursion.  (Trivial case 0 returns nothing).If you are willing to give up "pure" Python but gain a lot of firepower, there is Sage - example here:You\'ll note that it returns as a string, so to use it as a number you\'d want to do something likeCalculator with all neccessary functions for DEC,BIN,HEX:\n(made and tested with Python 3.5)You can change the input test numbers and get the converted ones.Here\'s a simple binary to decimal converter that continuously loopsAlong a similar line to Yusuf Yazici\'s answerI adjusted it so that the only variable being mutated is result (and n of course).If you need to use this function elsewhere (i.e., have the result used by another module), consider the following adjustment:So -1 will be your sentinel value indicating the conversion failed. (This is assuming you are converting ONLY positive numbers, whether they be integers or longs).
