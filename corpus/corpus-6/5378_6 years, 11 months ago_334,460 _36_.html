How can I replace empty lines in Notepad++? I tried a find and replace with the empty lines in the find, and nothing in the replace, but it did not work; it probably needs regex.You need something like a regular expression.You have to be in Extended modeIf you want all the lines to end up on a single line use \\r\\n. If you want to simply remove empty lines, use \\n\\r as @Link originally suggested.Replace either expression with nothing.There is now a built-in way to do this as of version 6.5.2Edit -> Line Operations -> Remove Empty Lines or Remove Empty Lines (Containing Blank characters)There is a plugin that adds a menu entitled TextFX.  This menu, which houses a dizzying array of quick text editing options, gives a person the ability to make quick coding changes.  In this menu, you can find selections such as Drop Quotes, Delete Blank Lines as well as Unwrap and Rewrap TextDo the following: In notepad++ press CTRL+H , in search mode click on the "Extended (\\n, \\r, \\t ...)" radio button then type in the "Find what" box: \\r\\n (short for CR LF) and leave the "Replace with" box empty..Finally hit replace allThis worked for me:Well I\'m not sure about the regex or your situation..How about CTRL+A, Select the TextFX menu -> TextFX Edit -> Delete Blank Lines and viola all blank line gone.A side note - if the line is blank i.e. does not contain spaces, this will workCtrl+H.find - \\r\\r\nreplace with - \\r.You can search for the following regex: ^(?:[\\t ]*(?:\\r?\\n|\\r))+ and replace it with empty fieldThis obviously does not work if the blank lines contain tabs or blanks. Many web pages (e.g. http://www.guardian.co.uk/) contain these white lines, as a result of a faulty HTML editor.Remove white space using regular expression as follows:change pattern: [\\t ]+$\n  into nothing.where [\\t ] matches either tab or space. \'+\' matches one or more occurrences, and \'$\' marks the end of line.Then use notepad++/textFX to remove single or extra empty lines.\nBe sure that these blank lines are not significant in the given context.Sometimes \\n\\r etc not work, here to figure it out, what your actually regular expression should be. Advantage of this trick: If you want to replace in multiple file at once, you must need this method. Above will not work...Note: step 1 will remove your code intendation done via tabs and blank spacesCTRL+A, Select the TextFX menu -> TextFX Edit -> Delete Blank Lines as suggested above works.But if lines contains some space, then move the cursor to that line and do a CTRL + H. The "Find what:" sec will show the blank space and in the "Replace with" section, leave it blank.\nNow all the spaces are removed and now try CTRL+A, Select the TextFX menu -> TextFX Edit -> Delete Blank Lines/n/r assumes a specific type of line break. To target any blank line you could also use:This says - any line that begins and then ends with nothing between. This is more of a catch-all. Replace with the same empty string.I did not see the combined one as answer, so search for ^\\s+$ and replace by {nothing}An easy alternative for removing white space from empty lines:This will remove all trailing spaces, including trailing spaces in blank lines.\nMake sure, no trailing spaces are significant.A few of the above expressions and extended expressions did not work for me, but the regular expression "$\\n$" did.
