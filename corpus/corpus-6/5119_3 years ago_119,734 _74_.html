I am trying to run a Swift app on my iPhone 4s. It works fine on the simulator, and my friend can successfully run it on his iPhone 4s. I have iOS 8 and the official release of Xcode 6.I have tried Below is the error in entirety  For me none of the previous solutions worked. We discovered that there is an "Embedded Content Contains Swift Code" flag in the Build Settings that needs to be set to YES. It was NO by default!After setting this, clean the project before building again.For keen readers some explanation\nThe most important part is:set the Embedded Content Contains Swift Code (EMBEDDED_CONTENT_CONTAINS_SWIFT) build setting to YES in your app as shown in Figure 2. This build setting, which specifies whether a target\'s product has embedded content with Swift code, tells Xcode to embed Swift standard libraries in your app when set to YES.I started getting this error when I removed:from Runpath Search Paths in my build settings. Replacing it fixed everything up again (thank goodness for source control!)I don\'t know how it got there, but it appears to be needed for a binary to find its embedded Swift runtime.Surprisingly enough, all i did was "Clean" my project (shift+cmd+K) and it worked. Did seem to be related to the certificate though.For the device, you also need to add the dynamic framework to the Embedded binaries section in the General tab of the project.I think it\'s a bug when certificates are generated directly from Xcode. To resolve (at least in Xcode 6.1 / 6A1052d):OK, sharing here another cause of this error. It took me a few hours to sort this out.In my case the trust policy of my certificate in Keychain Access was Always Trust, changing it back to defaults solved the problem.In order to open the certificate settings window double click the certificate in the Keychain Access list of certificates. UPDATE for XCODE 8+from XCode8 the option for Embedded Content Contains Swift Code option is no longer available\nwill need to change the "Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries = YES"I was having this issue with running my Swift tests (but not my app). It turns out that the test needed to have more than @executable_path/Frameworks in it\'s Runpath Search Paths build setting for the test target. Setting the Runpath Search Paths to the following worked a charm for me: I think Apple has already summarized it under Swift app crashes when trying to reference Swift library libswiftCore.dylibCited from Technical Q&A QA1886:Swift app crashes when trying to reference Swift library\n  libswiftCore.dylib.Q:  What can I do about the libswiftCore.dylib loading error in my\n  device\'s console that happens when I try to run my Swift language app?A: To correct this problem, you will need to sign your app using code\n  signing certificates with the Subject Organizational Unit (OU) set to\n  your Team ID. All Enterprise and standard iOS developer certificates\n  that are created after iOS 8 was released have the new Team ID field\n  in the proper place to allow Swift language apps to run.Usually this error appears in the device\'s console log with a message\n  similar to one of the following:The new certificates are needed when building an archive and packaging\n  your app. Even if you have one of the new certificates, just resigning\n  an existing swift app archive won\xe2\x80\x99t work. If it was built with a\n  pre-iOS 8 certificate, you will need to build another archive.Important: Please use caution if you need to revoke and setup up a new\n  Enterprise Distribution certificate. If you are an in-house Enterprise\n  developer you will need to be careful that you do not revoke a\n  distribution certificate that was used to sign an app any one of your\n  Enterprise employees is still using as any apps that were signed with\n  that enterprise distribution certificate will stop working\n  immediately. The above only applies to Enterprise Distribution\n  certificates. Development certs are safe to revoke for\n  enterprise/standard iOS developers.As the AirSign guys state the problem roots from the missing OU attribute in the subject field of the In-House certificate.Subject: UID=269J2W3P2L, CN=iPhone Distribution: Company Name, OU=269J2W3P2L, O=Company Name, C=FRYou have to set the Runpath Search Paths to @executable_path/Frameworks as showed in the following screenshot of Build Settings:If you have any embedded frameworks made in Swift, than you can set to YES the Build Options Embedded Content Contains Swift Code.Let\'s project P is importing custom library L, then you must add L into P -> Build Phases -> Embed Frameworks -> +. That works for me.I was having the same problem after moving to a new mac, and after hours, trying all the suggested answers in the questions, none of this worked for me.The solution for me was installing this missing certificate.\nhttp://developer.apple.com/certificationauthority/AppleWWDRCA.cerFound the answer here.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/14495100/976628Change Copy Pods Resources for the target from:to:After having tried out everything, I finally found out, that the build seems not always include every detail again and again. Maybe for speeding up the process...\nIn order to ensure WHOLE packaging before running on a device, make a Clean first: Shift-Cmd-K.\nThen build with: Cmd-B.\nAfter that run it on your device.\nEasy.\nKind regards to all you nice guys in that place!For me, having tried everything with no success, what worked was to remove @executable_path/Frameworks from the Packaging section (don\'t know how it came to be in there in the first place)None of the solutions worked for me. Restarting the phone fixed it. Strange but it worked. I solved by deleting the derived data and this time it worked correctly. Tried with Xcode 7.3.1GMIn my case, it was just the name of my target : I renamed it like this : MyApp.something and the same issue appeared.\nBut I saw in the build Settings window, my product module name has been changed like this MyApp-something.\nSo, I removed the dot in my target name (MyAppSomething) and the issue was gone.none of these solutions seemed to work but when I changed the permission of the world Wide Developer cert to Use System defaults then it worked. I have included the steps and screenshots in the link below I would encourage you to log the ticket in apple bug report as mentioned here as Apple really should solve this massive error: \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/41401354/559760There are lot\'s of answers there but might be my answer will help some one. I am having same issue, My app works fine on Simulator but on Device got crashed as I Lunches app and gives error as above. I have tried all answers and solutions . In My Case , My Project I am having multiple targets .I have created duplicate target B from target A. Target B works fine while target A got crashed. I am using different Image assets for each target. After searching and doing google I have found something which might help to someone. App stop crashing when I change name of Launch images assets for both apps . e.g Target A Launch Image asset name LaunchImage A . Target B Lunch Image asset name LaunchImage B and assigned properly in General Tab of each target . My Apps works fine.Xcode 7.2, iOS 9.2 on one device, 9.0 on other. Both had the error. No idea what changed that caused it, but the solutions above for the WWDR were correct for me. Install that cert and problem solved.https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/43547\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/message/84846To add on to the Enterprise distribution cert solution: you can open Keychain and inspect the cert.  If there is any red text saying the trust chain can\'t be verified or it being revoked, it WILL NOT WORK!  On my computer, our distribution cert was showing as revoked even though the web portal showed it as still valid.  We got a new distribution cert, which was green (valid) in Keychain, and this solved the issue.Following these steps worked for me: Search for Runpath Search PathsChange its value to $(inherited) flag (remove @executable_path/Frameworks).The above solutions did not work for me. \nI fix the issue by the following steps:I\'m using Xcode 7.2. If you tried all of above and the error still occurs, try deleting the old certificate from Keychain Access! It\'s such a pain to finally fix this.In my case,I have set @executable_path/FrameworksBut I have to also set "Framework search paths"change as recursiveWhich works for me.When Xcode asks you to reset certs, you reset it. And the app can be run on actual device without crash with that error messages. Once this problem is fixed in one swift project. Other swift projects with this problem are fixed also. I have struggled for these about half a day and I found that reset certs again and again in provisioning portal doesn\'t help. I have multiple version of Xcode installed at the same time. The framework was built with a newer version of Xcode. The app that I tried to compile was with an older version of Xcode. When I cleaned and compiled both the framework and the app with the same version of Xcode then things worked.In my case, one of my testing targets was working but the other one was not. It was giving the above error with a missing library or whatever. I compared the settings for both of the testing targets and found that one was missing the configuration for "Test Host", so I copied that from the working test target and it fixed my broken test target!From the post of https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-integration-specs/pull/24/files, that mean swift.dylib need sign but failed. I failed even create a new swift project with cocoapod support.
