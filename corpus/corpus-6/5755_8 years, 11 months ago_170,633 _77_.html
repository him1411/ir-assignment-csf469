I want to setup my local development machine so that any requests for *.local are redirected to localhost. The idea is that as I develop multiple sites, I can just add vhosts to Apache called site1.local, site2.local etc, and have them all resolve to localhost, while Apache serves a different site accordingly.I am on Windows XP.I tried adding to my c:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts file, also tried:Neither of which seem to work.I know I can set them up on different port numbers, but that is a pain since it is hard to remember which port is which.I don\'t want to have to setup a local DNS server or anything hard, any suggestions?Acrylic DNS Proxy (free, open source) does the job. It creates a proxy DNS server (on your own computer) with its own hosts file. The hosts file accepts wildcards.Download from the offical websitehttp://mayakron.altervista.org/support/browse.php?path=Acrylic&name=HomeTo configure Acrylic DNS Proxy, install it from the above link then go to:Add the folowing lines on the end of the file:Restart the Acrylic DNS Proxy service:You will also need to adjust your DNS setting in you network interface settings:Set "Use the following DNS server address":If you then combine this answer with jeremyasnyder\'s answer (using VirtualDocumentRoot) you can then automatically setup domains/virtual hosts by simply creating a directory.To answer your question, you cannot use wildcards in the hosts file under Windows.However, if you want to only change the hosts file to make new sites work.... you can configure your Apache like this and you don\'t have to keep editing it\'s config:http://postpostmodern.com/instructional/a-smarter-mamp/Basically a quick summary based on my setup, add the following to your apache.conf file:This allows me to add an entry like:and then make the directory, c:\\xampp\\sites\\dev\\test and place the necessary files in there and it just works.The other option is to use <Directory> tags in apache.conf and reference the pages from http://localhost/project/.I don\'t think that it is possible.You anyway have to modify the apache virtualroot entries every time you add a new site and location, so it\'s not a big work to syncronise the new name to the Windows vhost file.Update: please check the next answer and the comments on this answer. This answer is 6 years old and not correct anymore.I found a posting about Using the Windows Hosts File that also says "No wildcards are allowed."In the past, I have just added the additional entries to the hosts file, because (as previously said), it\'s not that much extra work when you already are editing the apache config file.Editing the hosts file is less of a pain when you run "ipconfig /flushdns" from the windows command prompt, instead of restarting your computer.To add to the great suggestions already here, XIP.IO is a fantastic wildcard DNS server that\'s publicly available.(The ability to specify non-loopback addresses is fantastic for testing sites on iOS devices where you cannot access a hosts file.)If you combine this with some of the Apache configuration mentioned in other answers, you can potentially add VirtualHosts with zero setup.You could talk your network administrator into setting up a domain for you (say \'evilpuppetmaster.hell\') and having the wildcard there so that everything (*.evilpuppetmaster.hell\') resolves to your IPI have written a simple dns proxy in Python. It will read wildcard entries in /etc/hosts. See here: http://code.google.com/p/marlon-tools/source/browse/tools/dnsproxy/dnsproxy.pyI have tested in Linux & Mac OS X, but not yet in Windows.You may try AngryHosts, which provided a way to support wildcard and regular expression. Actually, it\'s a hosts file enhancement and management software.\nMore features can be seen @ http://angryhosts.com/features/We have this working using wildcard DNS in our local DNS server: add an A record something like *.local -> 127.0.0.1I think that your network settings will need to have the chosen domain suffix in the domain suffix search list for machines on the network, so you might want to replace .local with your company\'s internal domain (e.g. .int) and then add a subdomain like .localhost.int to make it clear what it\'s for.So *.localhost.int would resolve to 127.0.0.1 for everybody on the network, and config file settings for all developers would "just work" if endpoints hang off that subdomain e.g. site1.localhost.int, site2.localhost.int This is pretty much the scheme we have introduced.dnsmasq also looks nice, but I have not tried it yet:\nhttp://ihaveabackup.net/2012/06/28/using-wildcards-in-the-hosts-file/I\'m using DNSChef to do that.https://thesprawl.org/projects/dnschef/You have to download the app, in Linux or Mac you need python to run it. Windows have their own exe.You must create a ini file with your dns entries, for example Then you must launch the dns application with admin privilegesor in windowsFinally you need to setup as your only DNS your local host environment (network, interface, dns or similar or in linux /etc/resolv.conf).That\'s itI made this simple tool to take the place of hosts. Regular expressions are supported.\nhttps://github.com/stackia/DNSAgentA sample configuration:I could not find a prohibition in writing, but by convention, the Windows hosts file closely follows the UNIX hosts file, and you cannot put wildcard hostname references into that file.If you read the man page, it says:Although it does say,that is not true from a practical level.Basically, the code that looks at the /etc/hosts file does not support a wildcard entry.The workaround is to create all the entries in advance, maybe use a script to put a couple hundred entries at once.@petah and Acrylic DNS Proxy is the best answer, and at the end he references the ability to do multi-site using an Apache which @jeremyasnyder describes a little further down...... however, in our case we\'re testing a multi-tenant hosting system and so most domains we want to test go to the same virtualhost, while a couple others are directed elsewhere.So in our case, you simply use regex wildcards in the ServerAlias directive, like so...Here is the total configuration for those trying to accomplish the goal (wildcards in dev environment ie, XAMPP -- this example assumes all sites pointing to same codebase)file:   %SystemRoot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hostsfile: \\XAMPP\\etc\\httpd.conffile: XAMPP\\etc\\extra\\httpd-vhosts.confrestart apachesave as whatever.pac wherever you want to and then load the file in the browser\'s network>proxy>auto_configuration settings (reload if you alter this)You can use echoipdns for this (https://github.com/zapty/echoipdns).  By running echoipdns local  all requests for .local subdomains are redirected to 127.0.0.1, so any domain with xyz.local etc will resolve to 127.0.0.1. You can use any other suffix also just replace local with name you want.Echoipdns is even more powerful, when you want to use your url from other machines in network you can still use it with zero configuration. For e.g. If  your machine ip address is 192.168.1.100 you could now use a domain name xyz.192-168-1-100.local which will always resolve to 192.168.1.100. This magic is done by the echoipdns by looking at the ip address in the second part of the domain name and returning the same ip address on DNS query. You will have to run the echoipdns on the machine from which you want to access the remote system.echoipdns also can be setup as a standalone DNS proxy, so by just point to this DNS, you can now use all the above benefits without running a special command every time, and you can even use it from mobile devices.So essentially this simplifies the wildcard domain based DNS development for local as well as team environment.echoipdns works on Mac, Linux and Windows.NOTE: I am author for echoipdns.You can use a dynamic DNS client such as http://www.no-ip.com. Then, with an external DNS server CNAME *.mydomain.com to mydomain.no-ip.com.While you can\'t add a wildcard like that, you could add the full list of sites that you need, at least for testing, that works well enough for me, in your hosts file, you just add:127.0.0.1       site1.local\n127.0.0.1       site2.local\n127.0.0.1       site3.local\n...Have apache listen on many ports is also an alternative.
