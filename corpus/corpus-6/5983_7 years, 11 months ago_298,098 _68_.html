Given this function, I want to replace the color with a random color generator.How can I do it?Use getRandomColor() in place of "#0000FF":I doubt anything will be faster or shorter than this one:Challenge!Here is another take on this problem.My goal was to create vibrant and distinct colors. To ensure the colors are distinct I avoid using a random generator and select "evenly spaced" colors from the rainbow.This is perfect for creating pop-out markers in Google Maps that have optimal "uniqueness" (that is, no two markers will have similar colors).If you wish to see what this looks like in action see http://blog.adamcole.ca/2011/11/simple-javascript-rainbow-color.html.Who can beat it? Guaranteed to work all the time: http://jsbin.com/OjELIfo/2/editBased on @eterps comment the code above can still generate shorter strings if hexadecimal representation of the random color is very short (0.730224609375 => 0.baf)This code should work in all cases:I like this one: \'#\' + (Math.random().toString(16) + "000000").substring(2,8)There is no need for a hash of hexadecimal letters. JavaScript can do this by itself:Random color generation with brightness control:Here\'s a twist on the solution provided by @Anatoliy.I needed to generate only light colours (for backgrounds), so I went with three letter (#AAA) format:The article written by Paul Irish on Random Hex Color Code Generator in JavaScript is absolutely amazing. Use: Here is the source link: http://www.paulirish.com/2009/random-hex-color-code-snippets/ This can be very easily be found using Google Search:Updated version:You can aslo use HSL available on every good browser (http://caniuse.com/#feat=css3-colors)This will give you only bright colors, you can also play around with the brightness, saturation and alpha.A breakdown of how this works:Math.random()*256 gets a random (floating point) number from 0 to 256 (0 to 255 inclusive)\nExample result: 116.15200161933899Adding the |0 strips off everything after the decimal point.\nEx: 116.15200161933899 -> 116Using .toString(16) converts this number to hexadecimal (base 16).\nEx: 116 -> 74\nAnother ex: 228 -> e4Adding "0" pads it with a zero. This will be important when we get the substring, since our final result must have two characters for each color.\nEx: 74 -> 074\nAnother ex: 8 -> 08.substr(-2) gets just the last two characters.\nEx: 074 -> 74\nAnother ex: 08 -> 08 (if we hadn\'t added the "0", this would have produced "8" instead of "08")The for loop runs this loop three times, adding each result to the color string, producing something like this:\n#7408e4So whilst all the answers here are good I wanted a bit more control over the output. For instance I\'d like to prevent any near white shades, whilst ensuring I get bright vibrant colours not washed out shades.So now I can specify 3 arbitrary ranges to pick rgb values from. You can call it with no arguments and get my default set which will usually generate a quite vibrant colour with once obvious dominant shade, or you can supply your own array of ranges.Short answer with pad to exact size\'#\'+((1<<24)*(Math.random()+1)|0).toString(16).substr(1)If you\'re a noob like me, clueless about hexadecimals and such, this might be more intuitive.You just need to end up with a string such as \'rgb(255, 123, 220)\'Yet another random color generator:You could use this simple function Array.prototype.reduce makes it very clean.Needs a shim for old browsers.http://jsfiddle.net/XmqDz/1/Use distinct-colors.It generates a palette of visually distinct colors.distinct-colors is highly configurable:Almost all of the previous short hand methods are generating invalid hex codes (five digits). I came across a similar technique only without that issue here:Try this in the console:Here are my two versions for a random hex code generator.You can use colorchain.js to generate a sequence of colors with varying hues.This function goes above and beyond other answers in two ways:It attempts to generate colors as distinct as possible by finding\n   which color out of 20 tries has the farthest euclidian distance from\n   the others in the HSV coneIt allows you to restrict the hue,\n   saturation, or value range, but still attempts to pick colors as\n   distinct as possible within that range.It\'s not super efficient, but for reasonable values (who could even pick apart 100 colors easily?)  It\'s fast enough.See JSFiddleMy version:Just because I can, I created an unreadable snippet that randomizes between min and max hex codes...:a("990099","ff00ff")  \xe2\x86\x92 might randomize \xe2\x86\x92 b5009eIt does it in pairs, so a("12","f2")  \xe2\x86\x92 might randomize \xe2\x86\x92 8f.\nBut it won\'t go above \'f2\'.It is the same as:But slower.The top voted comment of the top answer suggests that Martin Ankerl\'s approach is better than random hex numbers, and although I haven\'t improved on Ankerl\'s methodology, I have successfully translated it to JavaScript. I figured I\'d post an additional answer to this already mega-sized SO thread because the top answer has another comment linking to a Gist with the JS implementation of Ankerl\'s logic and that link is broken (404). If I had the reputation, I would have simply commented the jsbin link I created.https://jsbin.com/qeyevoj/edit?js,consoleThere are so many ways you can accomplish this. Here\'s two I did:Generates six random hex digits (0-F)Generates individual RGB components (00-FF)I think the first response is the most succinct/useful, but I just wrote one that would probably be easier for a beginner to understand.
