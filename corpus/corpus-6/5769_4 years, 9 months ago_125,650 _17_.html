I would like to know what are all the possible values for the timezone argument in the Python library Pytz.SOLUTIONYou can list all the available timezones with pytz.all_timezones:There is also pytz.common_timezones:The timezone name is the only reliable way to specify the timezone. You can find a list of timezone names here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\nNote that this list contains a lot of alias names, such as US/Eastern for the timezone that is properly called America/New_York.If you programatically want to create this list from the zoneinfo database you can compile it from the zone.tab file in the zoneinfo database. I don\'t think pytz has an API to get them, and I also don\'t think it would be very useful.Don\'t create your own list - pytz has a built-in set:You can then apply a timezone:Or if you already have a datetime object that is TZ aware (not naive):They appear to be populated by the tz database time zones found here.Here, Python list of country codes, names, continents, capitals, and pytz timezones.For full list : \nGist GithubHope, It helps.In my opinion this is a design flaw of pytz library. It should be more reliable to specify a timezone using the offset, e.g.which gives you Canada/Pacific timezone.
