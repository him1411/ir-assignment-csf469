I have a Map in java that has strings for both . Data is like following: <"question1", "1">, <"question9", "1">, <"question2", "4">, <"question5", "2">I want to sort the map based on its keys.  So In the end I will have question1, question2, question3....an so on. Eventually I am trying to get two strings out of this Map. First String: Questions ( in order 1 ..10) and Second String: Answers (in same order as question). Right now I have the following:This gets me the questions in a string but they are not in order...Use a TreeMap.  This is precisely what its for.  If this map is passed to you and you cannot determine the type, then you can do the following:This will iterate across the map in natural order of the keys.Technically, you can use anything that implements SortedMap, but except for rare cases this amounts to TreeMap, just as using a Map implementation typically amounts to HashMap.  For cases where your keys are a complex type that doesn\'t implement Comparable or you don\'t want to use the natural order then TreeMap and TreeSet have additional constructors that let you pass in a Comparator:Remember when using a TreeMap or TreeSet that it will have different performance characteristics than HashMap or HashSet.  Roughly speaking operations that find or insert an element will go from O(1) to O(Log(N)).In a HashMap, moving from 1000 items to 10,000 doesn\'t really affect your time to lookup an element, but for a TreeMap the lookup time will be about 3 times slower (assuming Log2).  Moving from 1000 to 100,000 will be about 6 times slower for every element lookup.Assuming TreeMap is not good for you (and assuming you can\'t use generics):Using the TreeMap you can sort the Map.Use a TreeMap!If you already have a map and would like to sort it on keys, simply use :A complete working example :Just use TreeMapProvided you cannot use TreeMap, in Java 8 we can make use of toMap() method in Collectorswhich takes following parameters:Java 8 ExampleWe can modify the example to use custom comparator and to sort based on keys as:This code can sort a key-value map in both orders i.e. ascending and descending.As an example:We can also sort the key by using Arrays.sort method.
