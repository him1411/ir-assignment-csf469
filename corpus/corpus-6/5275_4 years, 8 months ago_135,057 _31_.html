Brew doctor says: Warning: /usr/local/include isn\'t writable. This can happen if you "sudo make install" software that isn\'t managed by Homebrew.If a brew tries to write a header file to this directory, the install\n  will fail during the link step.You should probably chown /usr/local/includeI\'ve tried different commands to solve this but I\'m still stuck here.I\'m running homebrew on 10.8.2Take ownership of it and everything in it.Then do anotherWhat worked for me was tooWhat worked for me was The only one that worked for me on El Capitan was:You can alias the command to fix this problem in your .bash_profile and run it every time you encounter it:At the end of the file ~/.bash_profile, add: And now inside your terminal you can run: This worked for me on macOS 10.12sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/localI had the problem updating homebrew with the following error:Work for meFor some it\'s going to be: where "lib" is used as opposed to "bin" or "include" or "whatever else"The Homebrew Warning "should" explain what specifically is not writable and then give you a command syntax for follow, however you will need to use the ":" as opposed to what the Warning mentions which is actually not correct syntax?? I have had this happen in my organization after all our users were bound to active directory (effectively changing the UID from 50x to ######).Now it is simply a case of changing the ownership of all files where were owned by x to y.Where 501 is my old numeric user id which is still associated with all the homebrew files.The old user id can be found using ll /usr/local/CellarNow update the ownership\nsudo find /usr/local -user 501 -exec chown -h $USER {} \\;This way we avoid changing the ownership on files which are not controlled by homebrew or belong to some other system user.I found this nuance on the previous answers to work on my machine. Hope this helps if the others fall flat: no dollar sign and no :admin.You need to get control of entire /usr/local to do that you need to do a recursive chown under /usr/localsudo chown -R YOUR_USERNAME:admin /usr/local/
