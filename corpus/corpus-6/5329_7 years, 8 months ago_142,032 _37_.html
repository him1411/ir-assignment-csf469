When my app gets back to its root view controller, in the viewDidAppear: method I need to remove all subviews.How can I do this?Edit: With thanks to cocoafan: This situation is muddled up by the fact that NSView and UIView handle things differently. For NSView (desktop Mac development only), you can simply use the following:For UIView (iOS development only), you can safely use makeObjectsPerformSelector: because the subviews property will return a copy of the array of subviews:Thank you to Tommy for pointing out that makeObjectsPerformSelector: appears to modify the subviews array while it is being enumerated (which it does for NSView, but not for UIView).Please see this SO question for more details.Note: Using either of these two methods will remove every view that your main view contains and release them, if they are not retained elsewhere. From Apple\'s documentation on removeFromSuperview:If the receiver\xe2\x80\x99s superview is not nil, this method releases the receiver. If you plan to reuse the view, be sure to retain it before calling this method and be sure to release it as appropriate when you are done with it or after adding it to another view hierarchy.Get all the subviews from your root controller and send each a removeFromSuperview:In Swift you can use a functional approach like this:Note: This code is updated to Swift 2.1+ syntax.As a comparison, the imperative approach would look like this:These code snippets only work in iOS / tvOS though, things are a little different in OS X.If you want to remove all the subviews on your UIView (here yourView), then write this code at your button click:When removing all the subviews, it is a good idea to start deleting at the end of the array and keep deleting until you reach the beginning. This can be accomplished with this two lines of code:SWIFT 1.2or (less efficient, but more readable)NOTEYou should NOT remove the subviews in normal order, since it may cause a crash if a UIView instance is deleted before the removeFromSuperview message has been sent to all objects of the array. (Obviously, deleting the last element would not cause a crash) Therefore, the codeshould NOT be used. Quote from Apple documentation about makeObjectsPerformSelector:Sends to each object in the array the message identified by a given\n  selector, starting with the first object and continuing through the\n  array to the last object.(which would be the wrong direction for this purpose)Try this way swift 2.0If you\'re using Swift, it\'s as simple as:It\'s similar in philosophy to the makeObjectsPerformSelector approach, however with a little more type safety.Using Swift UIView extension:In objective-C, go ahead and create a category method off of the UIView class.Use the Following code to remove all subviews.In order to remove all subviews Syntax :Usage :This method is present in NSArray.h file and uses NSArray(NSExtendedArray) interfaceFor ios6 using autolayout I had to add a little bit of code to remove the constraints too.I\'m sure theres a neater way to do this, but it worked for me. In my case I could not use a direct [tagview removeConstraints:tagview.constraints] as there were constraints set in XCode that were getting cleared.In monotouch / xamarin.ios this worked for me:In order to remove all subviews from superviews:
