You can\'t put two __construct functions with unique argument signatures in a PHP class. I\'d like to do this:What is the best way to do this in PHP?I\'d probably do something like this:Then if i want a Student where i know the ID:Or if i have an array of the db row:Technically you\'re not building multiple constructors, just static helper methods, but you get to avoid a lot of spaghetti code in the constructor this way.Solution of Kris is really nice, but I find the mix of factory and fluent style better:PHP is a dynamic language, so you can\'t overload methods. You have to check the types of your argument like this:Now $paramters will be an array with the values \'One\', \'Two\', 3.Edit,I can add that will give you the number of parameters to the function.As of version 5.4, PHP supports traits. This is not exactly what you are looking for, but a simplistic trait based approach would be:We end up with two classes, one for each constructor, which is a bit counter-productive. To maintain some sanity, I\'ll throw in a factory:So, it all comes down to this:It\'s a horribly verbose approach, but it can be extremely convenient. You could do something like this:As has already been shown here, there are many ways of declaring multiple constructors in PHP, but none of them are the correct way of doing so (since PHP technically doesn\'t allow it).\nBut it doesn\'t stop us from hacking this functionality...\nHere\'s another example:Source: The easiest way to use and understand multiple constructors: Hope this helps. :)Another option is to use default arguments in the constructor like thisThis means you\'ll need to instantiate with a row like this: $student = new Student($row[\'id\'], $row) but keeps your constructor nice and clean.On the other hand, if you want to make use of polymorphism then you can create two classes like so:You could do something like the following which is really easy and very clean:as stated in the other comments, as php does not support overloading, usually the "type checking tricks" in constructor are avoided and the factory pattern is used inteadie. Let me add my grain of sand hereI personally like adding a constructors as static functions that return an instance of the class (the object). The following code is an example:Note that now you can create instance of the Person class like this:I took that code from:http://alfonsojimenez.com/post/30377422731/multiple-constructors-in-phpCall constructors by data type:As far as I know overloading is not supported in PHP. You can only overload properties\' get and set methods with overload(); (http://www.php.net/manual/en/overload.examples.basic.php)In response to the best answer by Kris (which amazingly helped design my own class btw), here is a modified version for those that might find it useful. Includes methods for selecting from any column and dumping object data from array. Cheers!You could always add an extra parameter to the constructor called something like mode and then perform a switch statement on it...Also with that method at any time if you wanted to add more functionality you can just add another case to the switch statement, and you can also check to make sure someone has sent the right thing through - in the above example all the data is ok except for C as that is set to "something" and so the error flag in the class is set and control is returned back to the main program for it to decide what to do next (in the example I just told it to exit with an error message "invalid mode" - but alternatively you could loop it back round until valid data is found).For php7, I compare parameters type as well, you can have two constructors with same number of parameters but different type.To use it:I created this method to let use it not only on constructors but in methods:My constructor:My doSomething method:Both works with this simple method:So you can declareor and so on :)And when using:it will call __constructN, where you defined N argsthen \n   $myObject -> doSomething($arg1, $arg2,..., $argM)it will call doSomethingM, , where you defined M args;
