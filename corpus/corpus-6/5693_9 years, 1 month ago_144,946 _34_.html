I\'m thinking in particular of how to display pagination controls, when using a language such as C# or Java.If I have x items which I want to display in chunks of y per page, how many pages will be needed?Found an elegant solution:Source: Number Conversion, Roland Backhouse, 2001Converting to floating point and back seems like a huge waste of time at the CPU level.Ian Nelson\'s solution:Can be simplified to:AFAICS, this doesn\'t have the overflow bug that Brandon DuRette pointed out, and because it only uses it once, you don\'t need to store the recordsPerPage specially if it comes from  an expensive function to fetch the value from a config file or something.I.e. this might be inefficient, if config.fetch_value used a database lookup or something:This creates a variable you don\'t really need, which probably has (minor) memory implications and is just too much typing:This is all one line, and only fetches the data once:This should give you what you want.  You will definitely want x items divided by y items per page, the problem is when uneven numbers come up, so if there is a partial page we also want to add one page.For C# the solution is to cast the values to a double (as Math.Ceiling takes a double):In java you should do the same with Math.ceil().The integer math solution that Ian provided is nice, but suffers from an integer overflow bug. Assuming the variables are all int, the solution could be rewritten to use long math and avoid the bug:int pageCount = (-1L + records + recordsPerPage) / recordsPerPage;If records is a long, the bug remains. The modulus solution does not have the bug.A variant of Nick Berardi\'s answer that avoids a branch:Note: (-r >> (Integer.SIZE - 1)) consists of the sign bit of r, repeated 32 times (thanks to sign extension of the >> operator.)  This evaluates to 0 if r is zero or negative, -1 if r is positive.  So subtracting it from q has the effect of adding 1 if records % recordsPerPage > 0.For records == 0, rjmunro\'s solution gives 1.  The correct solution is 0.  That said, if you know that records > 0 (and I\'m sure we\'ve all assumed recordsPerPage > 0), then rjmunro solution gives correct results and does not have any of the overflow issues.All the integer math solutions are going to be more efficient than any of the floating point solutions.Another alternative is to use the mod() function (or \'%\'). If there is a non-zero remainder then increment the integer result of the division.Alternative to remove branching in testing for zero:Not sure if this will work in C#, should do in C/C++.I do the following, handles any overflows:And use this extension for if there\'s 0 results:Also, for the current page number (wasn\'t asked but could be useful):In need of an extension method: No checks here (overflow, DivideByZero, etc), feel free to add if you like. By the way, for those worried about method invocation overhead, simple functions like this might be inlined by the compiler anyways, so I don\'t think that\'s where to be concerned. Cheers.P.S. you might find it useful to be aware of this as well (it gets the remainder): A generic method, whose result you can iterate over may be of interest:I had a similar need where I needed to convert Minutes to hours & minutes. What I used was:The following should do rounding better than the above solutions, but at the expense of performance (due to floating point calculation of 0.5*rctDenominator):You\'ll want to do floating point division, and then use the ceiling function, to round up the value to the next integer.
