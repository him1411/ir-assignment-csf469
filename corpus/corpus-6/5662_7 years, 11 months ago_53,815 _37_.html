I have been bitten by the Windows/Linux line-ending issue with git.  It seems, via GitHub, MSysGit, and other sources, that the best solution is to have your local repos set to use linux-style line endings, but set core.autocrlf to true.  Unfortunately, I didn\'t do this early enough, so now every time I pull changes the line endings are borked.I thought I had found an answer here but I can\'t get it to work for me.  My Linux command line knowledge is limited at best, so i am not even sure what the "xargs fromdos" line does in his script.  I keep getting messages about no such file or directory existing, and when I manage to point it to an existing directory, it tells me I don\'t have permissions. I\'ve tried this with MSysGit on Windows and via the Mac OS X terminal.  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.The git documentation for gitattributes now documents another approach for "fixing" or normalizing all the line endings in your project.  Here\'s the gist of it:If any files that should not be\n  normalized show up in git status,\n  unset their text attribute before\n  running git add -u.manual.pdf      -textConversely, text files that git does\n  not detect can have normalization\n  enabled manually.weirdchars.txt  textThe easiest way to fix this is to make one commit that fixes all the line endings. Assuming that you don\'t have any modified files, then you can do this as follows.My procedure for dealing with the line endings is as follows (battle tested on many repos):When creating a new repo:When dealing with an existing repo:In .gitattributes I declare all text files explicitly as having LF EOL since generally Windows tooling is compatible with LF while non-Windows tooling is not compatible with CRLF (even many nodejs command line tools assume LF and hence can change the EOL in your files).My .gitattributes usually looks like:To figure out what distinct extensions are tracked by git in the current repo, look hereOnce this is done, there\'s one more common caveat though.Say your master is already up-to-date and normalized, and then you checkout outdated-branch. Quite often right after checking out that branch, git marks many files as modified. The solution is to do a fake commit (git add -A . && git commit -m \'fake commit\') and then git rebase master. After the rebase, the fake commit should go away.Explanation:git status --shortThis displays each line that git is and is not aware of. Files that are not under git control are marked at the beginning of the line with a \'?\'. Files that are modified are marked with an M.grep "^ *M"This filters out only those files that have been modified.awk \'{print $2}\'This shows only the filename without any markers.xargs fromdosThis takes the filenames from the previous command and runs them through the utility \'fromdos\' to convert the line-endings.The "| xargs fromdos" reads from standard input (the files find finds) and uses it as arguments for the command fromdos, which converts the line endings. (Is fromdos standard in those enviroments? I\'m used to dos2unix). Note that you can avoid using xargs (especially useful if you have enough files that the argument list is too long for xargs):orI\'m not totally sure about your error messages. I successfully tested this method. What program is producing each? What files/directories do you not have permissions for? However, here\'s a stab at guessing what your it might be:One easy way to get a \'file not found\' error for the script is by using a relative path - use an absolute one. Similarly you could get a permissions error if you haven\'t made your script executable (chmod +x).Add comments and I\'ll try and help you work it out!okay... under cygwin we don\'t have fromdos easily available, and that awk substeb blows up in your face if you have any spaces in paths to modified files (which we had), so I had to do that somewhat differently:kudos to @lloyd for the bulk of this solutionHere\'s how I fixed all line endings in the entire history using git filter-branch. The ^M character needs to be entered using CTRL-V + CTRL-M. I used dos2unix to convert the files since this automatically skips binary files.Follow these steps if none of other answers works for you:Then your local should be clean now.
