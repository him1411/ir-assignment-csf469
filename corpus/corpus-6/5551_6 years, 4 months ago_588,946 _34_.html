I am trying to accomplish the following sql statement but I want it to return all columns is this possible? Something like:You\'re looking for a group by:Which can occasionally be written with a distinct on statement:On most platforms, however, neither of the above will work because the behavior on the other columns is unspecified. (The first works in MySQL, if that\'s what you\'re using.)You could fetch the distinct fields and stick to picking a single arbitrary row each time.On some platforms (e.g. PostgreSQL, Oracle, T-SQL) this can be done directly using window functions:On others (MySQL, SQLite), you\'ll need to write subqueries that will make you join the entire table with itself (example), so not recommended.From the phrasing of your question, I understand that you want to select the distinct values for a given field and for each such value to have all the other column values in the same row listed. Most DBMSs will not allow this with neither DISTINCT nor GROUP BY, because the result is not determined.Think of it like this: if your field1 occurs more than once, what value of field2 will be listed (given that you have the same value for field1 in two rows but two distinct values of field2 in those two rows).You can however use aggregate functions (explicitely for every field that you want to be shown) and using a GROUP BY instead of DISTINCT:If I understood your problem correctly, it\'s similar to one I just had. You want to be able limit the usability of DISTINCT to a specified field, rather than applying it to all the data. If you use GROUP BY without an aggregate function, which ever field you GROUP BY will be your DISTINCT filed. If you make your query:It will show all your results based on a single instance of field1.For example, if you have a table with name, address and city. A single person has multiple addresses recorded, but you just want a single address for the person, you can query as follows:The result will be that only one instance of that name will appear with its address, and the other one will be omitted from the resulting table. Caution: if your fileds have atomic values such as firstName, lastName you want to group by both.because if two people have the same last name and you only group by lastName, one of those persons will be omitted from the results. You need to keep those things into consideration. Hope this helps. Great question @aryaxt -- you can tell it was a great question because you asked it 5 years ago and I stumbled upon it today trying to find the answer!I just tried to edit the accepted answer to include this, but in case my edit does not make it in:If your table was not that large, and assuming your primary key was an auto-incrementing integer you could do something like this:You can do it with a WITH clause.For example:This also allows you to select only the rows selected in the WITH clauses query.For SQL Server you can use the dense_rank and additional windowing functions to get all rows AND columns with duplicated values on specified columns. Here is an example...This is taking a row count for each distinct combination of col1, col2, and col3.in ORDER BY i have just put example here, you can also add ID field in this It can be done by inner queryJust include all of your fields in the GROUP BY clause.SELECT DISTINCT FIELD1, FIELD2, FIELD3 FROM TABLE1 works if the values of all three columns are unique in the table. If, for example, you have multiple identical values for first name, but the last name and other information in the selected columns is different, the record will be included in the result set. Add GROUP  BY to field you want to check for duplicates\nyour query may look likefield1 will be checked to exclude duplicate recordsor you may query like duplicate records of field1 are excluded from SELECT
