I get this error after a making trivial React example page:Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: _registerComponent(...): Target container is not a DOM element.Here\'s my code:HTML:What does this mean?By the time script is executed, document element is not available yet, because script itself is in the head. While it\'s a valid solution to keep script in head and render on DOMContentLoaded event, it\'s even better to put your script at the very bottom of the body and render root component to a div before it like this:and in your code, callYou should always render to a nested div instead of body. Otherwise all sorts of third-party code (Google Font Loader, browser plugins, whatever) can modify the body DOM node when React doesn\'t expect it, and cause weird errors that are very hard to trace and debug. Read more about this issue.The nice thing about putting script at the bottom is that it won\'t block rendering until script load in case you add React server rendering to your project.(IE9+)Note: Having <script async src="..."></script> in the header ensures that the browser will start downloading JavaScript bundle before HTML content is loaded.the ready function can be used like this: If you don\'t want to use jQuery, you can use the onload function:just a wild guess, how about adding to index.html the following:            like this:For me it worked! :-)In my case this error was caused by hot reloading, while introducing new classes. In that stage of the project, use normal watchers to compile your code.For those using ReactJS.Net and getting this error after a publish:Check the properties of your .jsx files and make sure Build Action is set to Content. Those set to None will not be published. I came upon this solution from this SO answer.I ran into similar/same error message. In my case, I did not have the target DOM node which is to render the ReactJS component defined. Ensure the HTML target node is well defined with appropriate "id" or "name", along with other HTML attributes (suitable for your design need)
