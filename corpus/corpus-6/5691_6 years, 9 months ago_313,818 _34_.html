I have created a layout that contains two buttons, Next and Previous. In between the buttons I\'m generating some dynamic views. So when I first launch the application I want to disable the "Previous" button since there wont be any previous views. I also want to disable the "Next" button when there are not more views to display. Is there anyway to disable the buttons?Did you try this?Update: Thanks to Gwen. Almost forgot that android:clickable can be set in your XML layout to determine whether a button can be clickable or not.You can\'t enable it or disable it in your XML (since your layout is set at runtime), but you can set if it\'s clickable at the launch of the activity with android:clickable.You just write a single line of code in your activityWhen you want to enable the same button just writeIn Java, once you have the reference of the button:To enable/disable the button, you can use either:Or:Since you want to disable the button from the beginning, you can use button.setEnabled(false); in the onCreate method.\nOtherwise, from XML, you can directly use:So:In my case, is working fine and it is enabling and disabling the button as it should. But once the button state becomes disabled, it never goes back to the enabled state again, although it\'s clickable. I tried invalidating and refreshing the drawable state, but no luck.If you or anyone having a similar issue, what works for me is setting the background drawable again. Works on any API Level.yes it can be disabled  in xml\njust use\n<Button\nandroid:enabled="false"/>first in xml make the button as android:clickable="false"then in your code, inside oncreate() method set the button property asthen inside the button click change the code into WRONG WAY IN LISTENER TO USE VARIABLE INSTEAD OF PARAMETER!!!RIGHT WAY: EDIT: \nIn reply to @jeroen-bollenis Interface definition for a callback to be invoked when a view is clicked.with method definition when the view is clicked the View class object makes callback to method onClick() sending as parameter itself, so null view parameter should not occur if it does it\'s an Assertion Error it could happen for example when View object class was destroyed in meanwhile (for example collected by GC) or method was tampered due to hack little about instanceof & null JLS / 15.20.2. Type Comparison Operator instanceofAt run time, the result of the instanceof operator is true\n      if the value of the RelationalExpression is not null\n      and the reference could be cast to the ReferenceType\n          without raising a ClassCastException.Otherwise the result is false.three words from the AuthorIF U ASK WHY ? MOSTLY TO AVOID NullPointerException Little more code will save your time on later bug tracking in your code & reduces the occurrence of abnomalies. consider following example:
