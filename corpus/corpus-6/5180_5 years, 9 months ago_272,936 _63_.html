What\'s the best method to get the index of an array which contains objects?Imagine this scenario:Now I would like to have the indexOf the object which hello property is \'stevie\' which, in this example, would be 1.I\'m pretty newbie with JavaScript and I don\'t know if there is a simple method or if I should build my own function to do that.Array.prototype.findIndex is supported in all browsers other than IE (non-edge). But the polyfill provided is nice.The solution with map is okay. But you are iterating over the entire array every search. That is only the worst case for findIndex which stops iterating once a match is found.or as a function:Just some notes:For example,I think you can solve it in one line using \'map\' function:In ES2015, this is pretty easy:or, probably with better performance for larger arrays:I like Pablo\'s answer, but Array#indexOf and Array#map don\'t work on all browsers. Underscore will use native code if it\'s available, but has fallbacks as well. Plus it has the pluck method for doing exactly what Pablo\'s anonymous map method does.Or prototype it :Mind the [0].It is proper to use reduce as in Antonio Laguna\'s answer.Apologies for the brevity...simple:See this example: http://jsfiddle.net/89C54/It starts to count with zero.I have made a generic function to check the below is the code & works for any objectThe first alert will return -1 (means match not found) & second alert will return 0 (means match found).Use _.findIndex from underscore.js library Here\'s the example\n_.findIndex([{a:1},{a: 2,c:10},{a: 3}], {a:2,c:10}) //1Try this:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keysYou can use a native and convenient function Array.prototype.findIndex() basically:The findIndex() method returns an index in the array, if an element in the array satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise -1 is returned.Just a note it is not supported on Internet Explorer, Opera and Safari, but you can use a Polyfill provided in the link below.More information:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndexFurthor of @Monika Garg answer, you can use findIndex() (There is a polyfill for unsupprted browsers).I saw that people downvoted this answer, and I hope that they did this because of the wrong syntax, because on my opinion, this is the most elegant way.The findIndex() method returns an index in the array, if an element in the array satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise -1 is returned.For example: If you are only interested into finding the position see @Pablo\'s answer.pos = myArray.map(function(e) { return e.hello; }).indexOf(\'stevie\');However, if you are looking forward to finding the element (i.e. if you were thinking of doing something like this myArray[pos]), there is a more efficient one-line way to do it, using filter.element = myArray.filter((e) => e.hello === \'stevie\')[0];See perfomance results (~ +42% ops/sec):\nhttp://jsbench.github.io/#7fa01f89a5dc5cc3bee79abfde80cdb3This is the way to find the object\'s index in arrayUsing the ES6 findIndex method, without lodash or any other libraries, you can write:This will compare the immediate properties of the object, but not recurse into the properties.If your implementation doesn\'t provide findIndex yet (most don\'t), you can add a light polyfill that supports this search:(from my answer on this dupe)I did some performance testing of various answers here, which anyone can run them self:https://jsperf.com/find-index-of-object-in-array-by-contentsBased on my initial tests in Chrome, the following method (using a for loop set up inside a prototype) is the fastest:This code is a slightly modified version of Nathan Zaetta\'s answer.In the performance benchmarks I tried it with both the target being in the middle (index 500) and very end (index 999) of a 1000 object array, and even if I put the target in as the very last item in the array (meaning that it it has to loop through every single item in the array before it\'s found) it still ends up the fastest.This solution also has the benefit of being one of the most terse for repeatedly executing, since only the last line needs to be repeated:You can simply use No underscore, no for, just a reduce.You can create your own prototype to do this:something like: This works without custom codeNote: this does not give the actual index, it only tells if your object exists in the current data structureI will prefer to use findIndex() method:index will give you the index number.
