Ok,I know all about array_pop(), but that deletes the last element.  What\'s the best way to get the last element of an array without deleting it?EDIT: Here\'s a bonus:or evenShort and sweet.I came up with solution to remove error message and preserve one-liner form and efficient performance:-- previous solutionNote: The extra parentheses are needed to avoid a PHP Strict standards:  Only variables should be passed by reference.Try To reset it (thanks @hopeseekr):Link to manual@David Murdoch added: \n$myLastElement = end(array_values($yourArray));// and now you don\'t need to call reset().\nOn E_STRICT this produces the warning Thanks o_O Tync and everyone!What\'s wrong with array_slice($array, -1)? (See Manual: http://us1.php.net/array_slice)array_slice() returns an array. Probably not what you are looking for. You want the element.One way to avoid pass-by-reference errors (eg. "end(array_values($foo))") is to use call_user_func or call_user_func_array:The many answers in this thread present us with many different options. To be able to choose from them I needed to understand their behavior and performance. In this answer I will share my findings with you, benchmarked against PHP versions 5.6.29 and 7.1.0. The options I will test are:Test inputs:For testing I will use the 5.6.29 and 7.1.0 docker containers like:Each combination of the above listed <<option code>>s, the above listed test <<input code>>s will be run on both versions of PHP. For each test run the following code snippet is used:For each run this will var_dump the last retrieved last value of the test input and print the average duration of one iteration in nanoseconds.The results are as follows:The above mentioned Warning and Notice codes translate as:Based on this output I draw the following conclusions:Personally I do not like concerning myself with array internal pointers and prefer a solution in a single expression. Therefore short story I would myself use:A bit depending on whether using the array as stack or as queue you can make variations on option 9.untested:\nwouldn\'t this work?Since the array returned by array_values is fleeting, no-one cares if it\'s pointer is reset.and if you need the key to go with it I guess you\'d do:I need this quite often to deal with stacks, and i always find myself baffled that there\'s no native function that does it without manipulating the array or its internal pointer in some form.So i usually carry around a util function that\'s also safe to use on associative arrays.end() will provide the last element of an arrayTo get the last element of an array, use:BenchmarkI iterated 1,000 times, grabbing the last element of small and large arrays that contained 100 and 50,000 elements, respectively.I used PHP Version 5.5.32.For me:With associatives:To do this and avoid the E_STRICT and not mess with the array\'s internal pointer you can use:lelement only works with a copy so it doesn\'t affect the array\'s pointer.Another solution:No modification is made to $array pointers. This avoids the which might not be desired in certain conditions.For getting the last value from Array :For Removing last value form array :Simply: $last_element = end((array_values($array)))Doesn\'t reset the array and doesn\'t gives STRICT warnings. PS. Since the most voted answer still hasn\'t the double parenthesis, I submitted this answer.One more possible solution...How about:I think this is a slight improvement on all the existing answers:If you don\'t care about modifying the internal pointer (supports both indexed and associative arrays):If you want a utility function that doesn\'t modify the internal pointer:The original array\'s internal pointer is not modified, because the array is copied.Thus, the following alternative is actually faster as it doesn\'t copy the array, it just makes a slice:This "foreach / return" is a tweak for efficiently getting the first (and here single) item.Finally, the fastest alternative but for indexed arrays only:What if you want to get the last element of array inside of the loop of it\'s array?The code below will result into an infinite loop:The solution is obviously simple for non associative arrays:In almost every language with arrays you can\'t really go wrong with A[A.size-1].  I can\'t think of an example of a language with 1 based arrays (as opposed to zero based).
