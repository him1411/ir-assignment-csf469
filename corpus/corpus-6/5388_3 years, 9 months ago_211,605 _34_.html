I am in the process of porting a CLI library from Ruby over to Node.js. In my code I execute several third party binaries when necessary. I am not sure how best to accomplish this in Node.Here\'s an example in Ruby where I call PrinceXML to convert a file to a PDF:What is the equivalent code in Node?For even newer version of Node.js (v8.1.4), the events and calls are similar or identical to older versions, but it\'s encouraged to use the standard newer language features. Examples:For buffered, non-stream formatted output (you get it all at once), use child_process.exec:You can also use it with Promises:If you wish to receive the data gradually in chunks (output as a stream), use child_process.spawn:Both of these functions have a synchronous counterpart. An example for child_process.execSync:As well as child_process.spawnSync:Note: The following code is still functional, but is primarily targeted at users of ES5 and before.The module for spawning child processes with Node.js is well documented in the documentation (v5.0.0). To execute a command and fetch its complete output as a buffer, use child_process.exec:If you need to use handle process I/O with streams, such as when you are expecting large amounts of output, use child_process.spawn:If you are executing a file rather than a command, you might want to use child_process.execFile, which parameters which are almost identical to spawn, but has a fourth callback parameter like exec for retrieving output buffers. That might look a bit like this:As of v0.11.12, Node now supports synchronous spawn and exec. All of the methods described above are asynchronous, and have a synchronous counterpart. Documentation for them can be found here. While they are useful for scripting, do note that unlike the methods used to spawn child processes asynchronously, the synchronous methods do not return an instance of ChildProcess.Async and proper method:Sync:From Node.js v8.1.4 DocumentationThe same goes for Node.js v6.11.1 Documentation and Node.js v4.8.4 DocumentationYou are looking for child_process.execHere is the example:I just wrote a Cli helper to deal with Unix/windows easily.Javascript:Typescript original source file:Since version 4 the closest alternative is child_process.execSync method:Note that this method blocks event loop.If you want something that closely resembles the top answer but is also synchronous then this will work.@hexacyanide\'s answer is almost a complete one. \nOn Windows command prince could be prince.exe, prince.cmd, prince.bat or just prince (I\'m no aware of how gems are bundled, but npm bins come with a sh script and a batch script - npm and npm.cmd).\nIf you want to write a portable script that would run on Unix and Windows, you have to spawn the right executable.Here is a simple yet portable spawn function:I had the same problem and I found forever. It\'s a CLI you can install with npm and it worked completly fine with my raspberry pi! And if you want to run it on the startup, you can install "forever-service". They will install all you need to keep you app up and running at all times! Have a look!https://github.com/zapty/forever-servicehttps://www.npmjs.com/package/forever
