I have a couple old services that I want to completely uninstall. How can I do this?Use the SC command, like this (you need to be on a command prompt to execute the commands in this post):Note: You need to run the command prompt as an administrator, not just logged in as the administrator, but also with administrative rights. If you get errors above about not having the necessary access rights to stop and/or delete the service, run the command prompt as an administrator. You can do this by searching for the command prompt on your start menu and then right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator". Note to PowerShell users: sc is aliased to set-content. So sc delete service will actually create a file called delete with the content service. To do this in Powershell, use sc.exe delete service insteadIf you need to find the short service name of a service, use the following command to generate a text file containing a list of services and their statuses:For a more concise list, execute this command:The short service name will be listed just above the display name, like this:And thus to delete that service (it is not recommended to delete the SSDPSRV service btw):Click Start | Run and type regedit in the Open: line. Click OK.Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\ServicesScroll down the left pane, locate the service name, right click it and select Delete.Reboot the system.Use services.msc or (Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services) to find the service in question. Double-click to see the service name and the path to the executable.Check the exe version information for a clue as to the owner of the service, and use Add/Remove programs to do a clean uninstall if possible.Failing that, from the command prompt:No restart should be required.If you have Windows Vista or above please run this from a command prompt as Administrator:For example: sc delete moneytransferDelete the folder C:\\Program Files\\BBRTL\\moneytransfer\\Find moneytransfer registry keys and delete them:These steps have been tested on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008.We can do it in two different waysRemove Windows Service via RegistryIts very easy to remove a service from registry if you know the right path. Here is how I did that:Run Regedit or Regedt32Go to the registry entry "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services"Look for the service that you want delete and delete it. You can look at the keys to know what files the service was using and delete them as well (if necessary).Delete Windows Service via Command WindowAlternatively, you can also use command prompt and delete a service using following command:sc delete You can also create service by using following command sc create "MorganTechService" binpath= "C:\\Program Files\\MorganTechSPace\\myservice.exe"Note: You may have to reboot the system to get the list updated in service manager.If they are .NET created services you can use the installutil.exe with the /u switch\nits in the .net framework folder like\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v2.0.50727SC DELETE "service name"Run the command on cmd as Administrator other wise you will get this error :- openservice failed 5 access is deniedHere is a vbs script that was passed down to me:sc delete nameFor me my service that I created had to be uninstalled in Control Panel > Programs and FeaturesBefore removing the service you should review the dependencies.You can check it:Open services.msc and find the service name, switch to the "Dependencies" tab.Source: http://www.sysadmit.com/2016/03/windows-eliminar-un-servicio.htmlRemove the right key from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\
