I can\'t seem to figure this out. I have a .dot file, which is valid according to the syntax. How do I use graphviz to convert this into an image?(note that I\'m on Windows, not linux)type: dot -Tps filename.dot -o outfile.psIf you want to use the dot renderer. There are alternatives like neato and twopi. If graphiz isn\'t in your path, figure out where it is installed and run it from there.You can change the output format by varying the extension of the filename specified with -o.If you\'re using windows, check out the installed tool called GVEdit, it makes the whole process slightly easier.Go look at the graphviz site in the section called "User\'s Guides" for more detail on how to use the tools: http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php(See page 27 for output formatting for the dot command, for instance)http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/dotguide.pdfPostScript output seems always there. I am not sure if dot has PNG output by default. This may depend on how you have built it.dot file.dot -Tpng -o image.pngThis works on Windows and Linux. Graphviz must be installed.Get the graphviz-2.24.msi Graphviz.org. Then get zgrviewer. Zgrviewer requires java (probably 1.5+). You might have to set the paths to the Graphviz binaries in Zgrviewer\'s preferences.File -> Open -> Open with dot -> SVG pipeline (standard) ...\nPick your .dot file. You can zoom in, export, all kinds of fun stuff. There\'s also the online viewers:\nhttp://www.webgraphviz.com/\nhttp://sandbox.kidstrythisathome.com/erdos/You can also output your file in xdot format, then render it in a browser using canviz, a JavaScript library.Canviz on code.google.com: To see an example, there is a "Canviz Demo" link on the page above as of November 2, 2014.
