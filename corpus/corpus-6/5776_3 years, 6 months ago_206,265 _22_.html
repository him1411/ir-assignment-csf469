I am getting white page after running my project but its work with .net Client properly Do I need any settings in the browser?\nand the link will come after the errorThese errors are usually generated from an ad blocking plugin, such as Adblock Plus. To test this use either a different browser or uninstall the ad blocking plugin (right clicking the extension by the URL bar and clicking "Remove from Chrome...").There is an easier way to temporarily disable an extension. In Chrome, opening an Incognito tab will usually stop extensions running (unless you have specifically told Chrome which ones to run in Incognito).My advice is to avoid any image names; class names or ID\'s with the words:in their name!I ran some tests and Ad blockers regularly block any direct content with these names either within the CSS file, Div or Span Layers.So an image name loaded via CSS such as advertise-with-us.png  gets blocked on any machine running such software for example.EDIT:  I\'ve Traced a list of web page elements in Chrome which AdBlock Plus sets the CSS value to "display:none". They probably apply to other browsers too:There are two steps here: troubleshooting and then fixing the issue:To troubleshoot, check to see if it is a browser and/or extension problem. Chrome, Firefox and others have incognito or private mode which does not load extensions or the basic database of passwords and cookies.In the case of ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT that is usually some kind of blocking software, such as Adblock, Ghostery, or some other kind of privacy/anti-spyware tool.Don\'t use keyworks like "ad", "ads", "advertise", etc. in image url or image class.\nAdblock block them automatically.As other people have mentioned, this issue is common when using adblock or similar extensions.The source of my issues was my Privacy Badger extension.I noticed the same error as soon as I added Google Analytics and started testing on localhost. I have both AdBlock as well as Ghostery... it actually (for me) wasn\'t AdBlock interfering - it was Ghostery. To "fix", in Ghostery settings, under "Analytics", uncheck Google Analytics.I had faced the similar error, it is basically caused when use the ad blockers.Turn them off, and you run it easily.I had a similar issue, also seeing "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONTENT_DECODING_FAILED" and "ILLEGAL TOKEN" errors when loading JS files locally.  Pressing CTRL+SHIFT+DEL and deleting all "Cookies and other site and plugin data" and "Cached images and files" fixed it. You can also just run chrome in incognito mode, that automatically switches off all your plugins/extensions, including any add blockers.  Then you can quickly see if the extensions are causing the problem.As others have pointed out, you need to disable extensions and retry the page to see if errors reoccur. If not, then the culprit might be one (or more) of them.On my own case it was a deprecated switch, I\'ve set up long ago. I used process-per-tab which was getting phased-out in recent (48-53) versions. Once I removed that switch all started to work correctly.This issue may be due to the flags of chrome browser. Reset it, it worked for me.\nchrome://flags\nRight corner \'Reset all to defaults\' button.
