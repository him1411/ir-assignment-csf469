Operating system: LinuxFilesystem type: ext3Preferred solution: bash (script/oneliner), ruby, pythonI have several directories with several subdirectories and files in them. I need to make a list of all these directories that is constructed in a way such that every first-level directory is listed next to the date and time of the latest created/modified file within it.To clarify, if I touch a file or modify its contents a few subdirectory levels down, that timestamp should be displayed next to the first-level directory name.  Say I have a directory structured like this:and I modify the contents of the file example.txt, I need that time displayed next to the first-level directory alfa in human readable form, not epoch. I\'ve tried some things using find, xargs, sort and the likes but I can\'t get around the problem that the filesystem timestamp of \'alfa\' doesn\'t change when I create/modify files a few levels down.Try this one:Execute it with the path to the directory where it should start scanning recursively (it supports filenames with spaces).If there are lots of files it may take a while before it returns anything. Performance can be improved if we use xargs instead:which is a bit faster. To find all files that file status was last changed N minutes ago:find -cmin -Nfor example:find -cmin -5I shortened halo\'s awesome answer to this one-linerUpdated: If there are spaces in filenames, you can use this modificationGNU Find (see man find) has a -printf parameter for displying the files EPOC mtime and relative path name.Try this It uses find to gather all files from the directory, ls to list them sorted by modification date, head for selecting the 1st file and finally stat to show the time in a nice format.At this time it is not safe for files with whitespace or other special chars in their names. Write a commend if it doesn\'t meet your needs yet.This command works on Mac OS X: find "$1" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 stat --format \'%Y :%y %n\' | sort -nr | cut -d: -f2- | headOn Linux, as the original poster asked, use stat instead of gstat. This answer is, of course, user37078\'s outstanding solution, promoted from comment to full answer. I mixed in CharlesB\'s insight to use gstat on Mac OS X. I got coreutils from MacPorts rather than homebrew, by the way.And here\'s how I packaged this into a simple command ~/bin/ls-recent.sh for reuse:Both the perl and Python solutions in this post helped me solve this problem on Mac OS X: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9247/how-to-list-files-sorted-by-modification-date-recursively-no-stat-command-avail.Quoting from the post:Perl:Python:I have this alias in my .profile that I use quite often So it does exactly what you are looking for - looks for latest files (*.log and *.trc files in this case); also it only finds files modified in last day, then sorts by time and pipes output through less:ps. Notice I don\'t have root on some of the servers, but always have sudo, so you may not need that part.I\'m showing this for latest access time, you can easily modify this to do latest mod time.There is two ways to do this:1)If you want to avoid global sorting which can be expensive if you have tens of millions of files, then you can do: (position yourself in the root of the directory where you want your search to start)The above method prints filenames with progressively newer access time and the last file it prints is the file with the latest access time. You can obviously get the latest access time using a "tail -1".2)You can have find recursively print the name,access time of all files in your subdirectory and then sort based on access time and the tail the biggest entry:And there you have it...Here is one version that works with filenames that may contain spaces, newlines, glob characters as well:As question is tagged with Linux so I am assuming gnu utils are available.You can pipe above with:to print modification time and filenames sorted by modification time (most recent first) terminated by newlines.Quick bash function:Find the latest modified file in a directory:You can also specify your own date/time format as the third argument.The following returns you a string of the time-stamp and the name of the file with the most recent time-stamp:Resulting to an output of the form:\n<yy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.nanosec> <filename>Handles spaces in filenames well \xe2\x80\x94 not that you should use those!More find galore can be found by following the link.You may give the printf command of find a try%Ak    File\'s  last  access  time  in\n  the format specified by k,\n                       which is either @\' or a directive for the  C\n  strftime\'\n                       function.   The  possible  values for k are listed\n  below;\n                       some of them might not be available on all \n  systems,  due\n                       to differences in `strftime\' between systems.For plain ls output, use this.  There is no argument list, so it can\'t get too long:And niceified with cut for just the dates, times, and name:EDIT: Just noticed that the current top answer sorts by modification date.  That\'s just as easy with the second example here, since the modification date is first on each line - slap a sort onto the end:This could be done with a reccursive function in bash tooLet F a function that displays the time of file which must be lexicographically sortable yyyy-mm-dd etc., (os-dependent?)R the recursive function that run through directoriesAnd finally
