I am on shared hosting and have Cpanel, Apache, PHP is run by fastcgi.  Where does PHP store the error log?Is there any other way I can find the error log on shared hosting environment instead of having to go through entire site structure to look for error_log files?I have access to the php.ini (I am using PHP version 5.2.16).Php stores error logs in /var/log/apache2 if php is an apache2 module. \nShared hosts are often storing log files in your root directory /log subfolder.\nBut...if you have access to a php.ini file you can do this:According to rinogo\'s comment: If you\'re using cPanel, the master log file you\'re probably looking for is stored (by default) atIf all else fails you can check the location of the log file usingTry phpinfo() and check for "error_log"On a LAMP environment the php errors are default directed to this below file. All access logs come under:The terminal will output the error log location.The command prompt will output the error log locationOpen your php.ini and add the following line:\n  Thanks @chelmertez, @Boom for these (comments on the question).\nHow do find your PHP error log on Linux:Another equivalent way:It can also be /var/log/apache2/error.log if you are in google compute engine.And you can view tail like this: You should use absolute path when setting error_log variable in your php.ini file, otherwise, error logs will be stored according to your relative path. Other solution would be writing simple script which would list all error logs files from directory tree.It appears that by default php does not log errors anywhere, the error_log key in php.ini is commented out in all the install\'s I\'ve seen.Generally I:Search these files for the error_reporting value; Which should be set to whatever amalgamation of php log levels are enough for you., Eg:   E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICTCheck the error_log value to make sure it points to an actual place and is not commented out.The default value doesn\'t give a full path, only a file name, I don\'t know where this path resolves to normally. Probably /var/log/.If you have build Apache and PHP from source, then the error logs by default is generated at your ${Apache install dir}/logs/error_log i.e generally /usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log. Else, if you have installed it from repository, you will find it at /var/log/apache2/error_log.You can set the path in your php.ini also and verify it by invoking phpinfo().If You use php5-fpm log default should be underThe best way is to look in your httpd.conf file and see what the default is. It could also be overridden by your specific virtual host. I start by looking at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf or /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and search for error_log. It could be listed as either /var/log/httpd/error_log or /var/log/apache2/error_log but it might also be listed as simply logs/error_log.In this case it is a relative path, which means it will be under /etc/httpd/logs/error_log. If you still can\'t find it check the bottom of your httpd.conf file and see where your virtual hosts are included. It might be in /etc/httpd/conf.d/<- as "other" or "extra". Your virtual host could override it then with ErrorLog "/path/to/error_log".NGINX usually stores it in /var/log/nginx/error.log or access.log.\n(On Ubuntu in any case)When configuring your error log file in php.ini, you can use an absolute path or a relative path.  A relative path will be resolved based on the location of the generating script, and you\'ll get a log file in each directory you have scripts in.  If you want all your error messages to go to the same file, use an absolute path to the file.See more here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.errorfunc.php#53025whereever you want it to, if you set it your function call:\nerror_log($errorMessageforLog .   "\\n",   4,   \'somePath/SomeFileName.som\');Search the httpd.conf file for ErrorLog by running cat <file location> | grep ErrorLog on the command line. For example:Output:Find the line that starts with ErrorLog and there\'s your answer.Note: For virtual hosts, you can edit the virtual hosts file httpd-vhosts.conf to specify a different log file location.Wordpress will direct error_log() messages to /wp-content/debug.log when WP_DEBUG_LOG is set to true.
