How can I specify a td tag should span all columns (when the exact amount of columns in the table will be variable/difficult to determine when the HTML is being rendered)? w3schools mentions you can use colspan="0", but it doesn\'t say exactly what browsers support that value (IE 6 is in our list to support). Edit: It appears that setting colspan to a value greater than the theoretical amount of columns you may have will work, but it will not work if you have table-layout set to fixed. Are there any disadvantages to using an automatic layout with a large number for colspan? Is there a more correct way of doing this?I have IE 7.0, Firefox 3.0 and Chrome 1.0The colspan="0" attribute in a TD is NOT spanning across all TDs in any of the above browsers.Maybe not recommended as proper markup practice, but if you give a higher colspan value than the total possible no. of columns in other rows, then the TD would span all the columns. This does NOT work when the table-layout CSS property is set to fixed.Once again, this is not the perfect solution but seems to work in the above mentioned 3 browser versions when the table-layout CSS property is automatic. Hope this helps.Warning: as mentioned in the comments below this is actually the same as colspan="100". Hence, this solution will break for tables with css table-layout: fixed or more than 100 columns.It is a hack and does NOT ensure your row spans all columnsJust use this:It works on Firefox 3.6, IE 7 and Opera 11! (and I guess on others, I couldn\'t try)If you want to make a \'title\' cell that spans all columns, as header for your table, you may want to use the caption tag (http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_caption.asp / https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption) This element is meant for this purpose. It behaves like a div, but doesn\'t span the entire width of the parent of the table (like a div would do in the same position (don\'t try this at home!)), instead, it spans the width of the table. There are some cross-browser issues with borders and such (was acceptable for me). Anyways, you can make it look as a cell that spans all columns. Within, you can make rows by adding div-elements. I\'m not sure if you can insert it in between tr-elements, but that would be a hack I guess (so not recommended). Another option would be messing around with floating divs, but that is yuck!DoDon\'tFor IE 6, you\'ll want to equal colspan to the number of columns in your table. If you have 5 columns, then you\'ll want: colspan="5".The reason is that IE handles colspans differently, it uses the HTML 3.2 specification:IE implements the HTML 3.2 definition, it sets colspan=0 as colspan=1.The bug is well documented.If you\'re using jQuery (or don\'t mind adding it), this will get the job done better than any of these hacks.To ease the implementation, I decorate any td/th I need adjusted with a class such as "maxCol" then I can do the following:If you find an implementation this won\'t work for, don\'t slam the answer, explain in comments and I\'ll update if it can be covered.Another working but ugly solution : colspan="100", where 100 is a value larger than total columns you need to colspan.According to the W3C, the colspan="0" option is valid only with COLGROUP tag.You can determine the number of columns in your table with something like this:And now use this column count as your column span. This assumes you\'ve got a reference to the body element for the table, but that should be straightforward.Just want to add my experience and answer to this.\nNote: It only works when you have a pre-defined table and a tr with ths, but are loading in your rows (for example via AJAX) dynamically.In this case you can count the number of th\'s there are in your first header row, and use that to span the whole column.This can be needed when you want to relay a message when no results have been found.Something like this in jQuery, where table is your input table:According to the specification colspan="0" should result in a table width td.However, this is only true if your table has a width! A table may contain rows of different widths. So, the only case that the renderer knows the width of the table if you define a colgroup! Otherwise, result of colspan="0" is indeterminable...http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/tables.html#adef-colspanI cannot test it on older browsers, but this is part of specification since 4.0...I had the same issue - How I resolved my issue .. Put any controls you wish to span in one tdMaybe I\'m a straight thinker but I\'m a bit puzzled, don\'t you know the column number of your table?By the way IE6 doesn\'t honor the colspan="0", with or without a colgroup defined.\nI tried also to use thead and th to generate the groups of columns but the browser doesn\'t recognlise the form colspan="0".I\'ve tried with Firefox 3.0 on windows and linux and it works only with a strict doctype.You can check a test on several bowser at http://browsershots.org/http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/wa10/tables/colspan-0.html I found the test page here http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/wa10/tables/colspan-0.htmlEdit: Please copy and paste the link, the formatting won\'t accept the double protocol parts in the link (or I am not so smart to correctly format it).try using "colSpan" instead of "colspan". IE likes the camelBack version...
