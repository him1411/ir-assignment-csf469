Can somebody tell me what all happens behind the scenes from the time I type in a URL in the browser to the time when I get to see the page on the browser? A detailed account of the process would be of great help.In an extremely rough and simplified sketch, assuming the simplest possible HTTP request, no proxies, IPv4 and no problems in any step:Again, discussion of each of these points have filled countless pages; take this only as a short summary. Also, there are many other things happening in parallel to this (processing typed-in address, speculative prefetching, adding page to browser history, displaying progress to user, notifying plugins and extensions, rendering the page while it\'s downloading, pipelining, connection tracking for keep-alive, checking for malicious content etc.) - and the whole operation gets an order of magnitude more complex with HTTPS (certificates and ciphers and pinning, oh my!).First the computer looks up the destination host. If it exists in local DNS cache, it uses that information. Otherwise, DNS querying is performed until the IP address is found.Then, your browser opens a TCP connection to the destination host and sends the request according to HTTP 1.1 (or might use HTTP 1.0, but normal browsers don\'t do it any more).The server looks up the required resource (if it exists) and responds using HTTP protocol, sends the data to the client (=your browser)The browser then uses HTML parser to re-create document structure which is later presented to you on screen. If it finds references to external resources, such as pictures, css files, javascript files, these are is delivered the same way as the HTML document itself.Look up the specification of HTTP.
