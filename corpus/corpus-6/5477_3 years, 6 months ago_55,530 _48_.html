I get the following error when attempting to install psycopg2 via pip on Mavericks 10.9:Not sure how to proceed and have searched here and elsewhere for this particular error.  Any help is much appreciated!Here is the complete output from pip:You can tell clang to not raise this as an error by setting the following environment variables prior compilation:Then pip install psycopg2should work.I had the same when trying to pip install lxml.Edit: if you are installing as superuser (which will likely be the case if you are trying to append to /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages, the native Apple factory-installed Python distribution which ships with OS X, rather than to some other Python distribution which you have subsequently installed yourself), then you will need to do, as described by @Thijs Kuipers in comments below:or the equivalent, for whatever other package name you may be substituting in place of psycopg2.UPDATE [2014-05-16]: Apple has fixed this problem with updated system Pythons (2.7, 2.6, and 2.5) in OS X 10.9.3 so the workaround is no longer necessary when using the latest Mavericks and Xcode 5.1+.  However, as of now, the workaround is still required for OS X 10.8.x (Mountain Lion, currently 10.8.5) if you are using Xcode 5.1+ there.Update: 10.9.3 resolves the issue with system CPython.This is caused by the latest clang update from Apple that came with Xcode 5.1 today and is affecting many, many people, so hopefully a fix will appear soon.Update: Did not expect this to get so much attention, but here\'s more detail: the clang 3.4 Apple is shipping defaults to erroring on unknown flags, but CPython builds modules using the same set of flags it was compiled with originally. The system CPython was compiled with several flags that are unknown by clang, thus causing this problem. The following are the current Mavericks (10.9.2) CPython compile flags:To resolve this issue you have a few options:xCode 5.1Here is a work around that involves removing the flag from the python installation.In /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/_sysconfigdata.py are several places where the -mfused-madd / -mno-fused-madd flag is set.Edit this file and remove all of the references to that flag your compilation should work:You need to delete the corresponding _sysconfigdata.pyc and _sysconfigdata.pyo files as well - at least on my system these files did not automatically get rebuilt:Note that have to use root access to make those changes.I also edited the system python\'s notion of its original compile flags (as @user3405479 did). Instead of an editor I used command line tools to edit the file "in place" (the inode does change). I also compiled new pyo and pyc files instead of leaving them deleted.The following commands are run as root, for example under sudo -ipushd /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7sed \'s/-mno-fused-madd//g\' _sysconfigdata.py \\\n| diff -p _sysconfigdata.py - | patch -bpython -m py_compile _sysconfigdata.pypython -OO -m py_compile _sysconfigdata.pypopdI used homebrew to install postgresql, and then wanted to install psycopg2 into the system-provided python 2.7 on Mavericks.  To get that to work I ended up running this:At least Apple is aware of this as this issue is discussed in the Xcode 5.1 Release Notes (Compiler section). Expect an updated Python and Ruby in the next OS update (fingers crossed!). Also take note that the -Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future flag is meant to be a temporary workaround and will go away in the future (hopefully after system Python is fixed!).If you are a Python package maintainer like me and want to save your users the hassle of working around this themselves, here is a solution (besides providing binary wheels/eggs) that goes into your setup.py file:None of the above solutions worked for me.  My situation is slightly different.  I was trying to install rdiff-backup via homebrew when I got this error message.I apparently have both Apple\'s default python (2.7.5 @ /usr/bin/python) and Homebrew\'s python (2.7.6 @ /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.6/bin/python), but the error was coming from Apple\'s python.To fix the problem, basically I switched the python binaries.I did this via sudo:Then, \'brew install rdiff-backup\' succeeded without any errors.Finally, I did "mv /usr/bin/python_orig /usr/bin/python"  to revert everything back.You\'re probably on Python 2.7.5Easiest solution go to www.python.org and install Python 2.7.6 which is compatible with the LLVM 5.1.Then toast your old virtual environment, rmvirtualenv {virtual_env_name}. Then make a new virtual env..pip should work fine after this.Trying to pip install paramiko on Amazon Linux AMI release 2016.09 gave me an error that included a link to this SO post. So, even though it doesn\'t fit the OP\'s Title, I\'m going to share the answer.I used homebrew python package.\nWorks well after re-compilling.Variation on the _sysconfigdata.py fix: use a virtual environmentcp /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/_sysconfigdata.py ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/lib/python2.7/_sysconfigdata.pyThen edit your copy at ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/lib/python2.7/_sysconfigdata.pyI removed all the occurences of \'-mno-fused-madd\' and then builds worked in that virtualenv.No root needed!For me, the bad flags were explicitly given in the package\'s Makefile. So I had to edit the makefile to remove the unrecognized flag from the erroring package.
