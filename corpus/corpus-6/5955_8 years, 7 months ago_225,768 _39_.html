How can I get superscript done, only in CSS?I have a stylesheet where I mark the external links with a superscript character, but I\'m having a hard time getting the character aligned correctly.What I have currently, looks like this:but it doesn\'t work.Naturally, I\'d use the <sup>-tag, only if content would allow for HTML... You can do superscript with  vertical-align: super, (plus an accompanying font-size reduction).However,  be sure to read the other answers here, particularly those by paulmurray and cletus, for useful information.Honestly I don\'t see the point in doing superscript/subscript in CSS only.  There\'s no handy CSS attribute for it, just a bunch of homegrown implementations including:or using vertical-align or I\'m sure other ways.  Thing is, it starts to get complicated:The second point is worth emphasizing.  Typically superscript/subscript is not actually a styling issue but is indicative of meaning.Side note: It\'s worth mentioning this list of entities for common mathematical superscript and subscript expressions even though this question doesn\'t relate to that.The sub/sup tags are in HTML and XHTML.  I would just use those.As for the rest of your CSS, the :after pseudo-element and content attributes are not widely supported.  If you really don\'t want to put this manually in the HTML I think a Javascript-based solution is your next best bet.  With jQuery this is as simple as:The CSS documentation contains industry-standard CSS equivalent for all HTML constructs. That is: most web browsers these days do not explicitly handle SUB, SUP, B, I and so on - they (kinda sorta) are converted into SPAN elements with appropriate CSS properties, and the rendering engine only deals with that.The page is Appendix D. Default style sheet for HTML 4The bits you want are:I was working on a page with the aim of having clearly legible text, with superscript elements NOT changing the line\'s top and bottom margins - with the following observations:If for your main text you have line-height: 1.5em for example, you should reduce the line-height of your superscript text for it to appear correctly. I used line-height: 0.5em.Also, vertical-align: super works well in most browsers but in IE8 when you have a superscript element present, the rest of that line is pushed down. So instead I used vertical-align: baseline together with a negative top and position: relative to achieve the same effect, which seems to work better across browsers.So, to add to the "homegrown implementations":http://htmldog.com/articles/superscript/ Essentially:Works well in practice, as far as I can tell.The following is taken from Mozilla Firefox\'s internal html.css:So, in your case it would be something, like:This is another clean solution:In this way you can still use sup/sub tags but you fixed their idious behavior to always screw up paragraph line height.So now you can do:And your paragraph line height should not get screwed up.Tested on IE7, IE8, FF3.6, SAFARI4, CHROME5, OPERA9I tested using a p {line-height: 1.3;} (that is a good line height unless you want your lines to stick too close) and it still works, cause "-0.6em" is such a small amount that also with that line height the sub/sub text will fit and don\'t go over each other.Forgot a detail that might be relevant I always use DOCTYPE in the 1st line of my page (specifically I use the HTML 4.01 <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">). So I don\'t know if this solution works well when browser is in quirkmode (or not standard mode) due to lack of DOCTYPE or to a DOCTYPE that does not triggers Standard/Almost Standard mode.If you are changing the font size, you might want to stop shrinking sizes with this rule:I am not sure if this is related but I have solved my problem with  &sup2; HTML entities as I wasn\'t able to add any other html tags inside a <label> tag. So the idea was using ASCII codes instead of css or HTML tags. The CSS property font-variant-position is under consideration and may eventually be the answer to this question. As of early 2017, only Firefox supports it, though.See MDN.Check out: http://www.cssdesignpatterns.com/Chapter%2012%20-%20ALIGNING%20CONTENT/Vertical-aligned%20Content/example.htmlif looks like you want "vertical-align:text-top"Here\'s the exact way sup uses:Found this via google chrome inspect element.
