I\'ve moved a file manually and then I\'ve modified it. According to Git, it is a new file and a removed file. Is there any way to force Git into treating it as a file move?Git will automatically detect the move/rename if your modification is not too severe. Just git add the new file, and git rm the old file. git status will then show whether it has detected the rename. additionally, for moves around directories, you may need to:If git status still shows "new file" and not "renamed" you need to follow Hank Gay\xe2\x80\x99s advice and do the move and modify in two separate commits.Do the move and the modify in separate commits.It\'s all a perceptual thing.  Git is generally rather good at recognising moves, because GIT is a content trackerAll that really depends is how your "stat" displays it.   The only difference here is the -M flag. git log --stat -Mgit log --statgit help log git diff -M or git log -M should automatically detect such changes as a rename with minor changes as long as they indeed are.\nIf your minor changes are not minor, you can reduce the similarity threashold, e.g.to reduce it from the default 50% to 20%.Here\'s a quick and dirty solution for one, or a few, renamed and modified files that are uncommitted.Let\'s say the file was named foo and now it\'s named bar:Rename bar to a temp name:Checkout foo:Rename foo to bar with Git:Now rename your temporary file back to bar.This last step is what gets your changed content back into the file.While this can work, if the moved file is too different in content from the original git will consider it more efficient to decide this is a new object. Let me demonstrate:If you\'re using TortoiseGit it\'s important to note that Git\'s automatic rename detection happens during commit but the fact that this is going to happen isn\'t always displayed by the software beforehand.  I had moved two files to a different directory and performed some slight edits.  I use TortoiseGit as my commit tool and the Changes made list showed the files being deleted and added, not moved.  Running git status from the command line showed a similar situation.  However after committing the files, they showed up as being renamed in the log.  So the answer to your question is, as long as you haven\'t done anything too drastic, Git should pick up the rename automatically.  Edit: Apparently if you add the new files and then do a git status from the command line, the rename should show up before committing.Edit 2: In addition, in TortoiseGit, add the new files in the commit dialog but don\'t commit them.  Then if you go into the Show Log command and look at the working directory, you\'ll see if Git has detected the rename before committing.The same question was raised here: https://tortoisegit.org/issue/1389 and has been logged as a bug to fix here: https://tortoisegit.org/issue/1440  It turns out it\'s a display issue with TortoiseGit\'s commit dialog and also kind of exists in git status if you haven\'t added the new files.If you\'re talking about git status not showing the renames, try git commit --dry-run -a insteadI had this problem recently, when moving (but not modifying) some files.The problem is that Git changed some line endings when I moved the files, and then wasn\'t able to tell that the files were the same.Using git mv sorted out the problem, but it only works on single files / directories, and I had a lot of files in the root of the repository to do.One way of fixing this would be with some bash / batch magic.Another way is the followingFor me it worked to stash save all the changes before the commit and pop them out again. This made git re-analyze the added / deleted files and it correctly marked them as moved.There is a probably a better \xe2\x80\x9ccommand line\xe2\x80\x9d way to do this, and I know this is a hack, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been able to find a good solution.Using TortoiseGIT: If you have a GIT commit where some file move operations are showing up as load of adds/deletes rather than renames, even though the files only have small changes, then do this:The new commit will now properly show the file renames\xe2\x80\xa6 which will help maintain proper file history.When I edit, rename, and move a file at the same time, none of these solutions work. The solution is to do it in two commits (edit and rename/move seperate) and then fixup the second commit via git rebase -i to have it in one commit.Use git mv command to move the files, instead of the OS move commands:\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-mvPlease note that git mv command only exists in Git versions 1.8.5 and up. So you may have to update your Git to use this command.
