I\'ve been trying to install lpng142 on my fed 12 system. Seems like a problem to me. I get this errorHow do I fix this? The /etc/fstab file:To fix, open your script with vi or vim and enter in vi command mode (key ESC), then type this:Finally save it:x! or :wq!Looks like you have a dos line ending file. The clue is the ^M.You need to re-save the file using Unix line endings.You might have a dos2unix command line utility that will also do this for you.Or if you want to do this with a script:Your configure file contains CRLF line endings (windows style) instead of simple LF line endings (unix style). Did you transfer it using FTP mode ASCII from Windows?You can use to fix this, or open it in vi and use :%s/^M//g; to substitute them all (use CTRL+V, CTRL+M to get the ^M)You can use following command to fixIf you could not found run the command,CentOS:Ubuntu / Debian:This usually happens when you have edited a file from Windows and now trying to execute that from some unix based machine.The solution presented on Linux Forum worked for me (many times):Hope this helps.PS: you need to have perl installed on your unix/linux machine.If you\'re on OS X, you can change line endings in XCode by opening the file and selecting theView -> Text -> Line Endings -> Unixmenu item, then Save. This is for XCode 3.x. Probably something similar in XCode 4.Following on from Richard\'s comment. Here\'s the easy way to convert your file to UNIX line endings. If you\'re like me you created it in Windows Notepad and then tried to run it in Linux - bad idea.Any other problems try this link.You can also do this in Kate. Thanks to pwc101\'s comment on this post, this command worked in Kali Linux .sed -i s/{ctrl+v}{ctrl+m}// {filename}Make sure you replace the bits in brackets, {}.  I.e. {ctrl+m} means press Ctrl key and the M key together.Use the dos2unix command in linux to convert the saved file.\nexample :If you are using TextMate or a similar programme, do save as, and then in encodings choose LF instead of CRLF. When you write your script on windows environment and you want to run it on unix environnement you need to be careful about the encodage :dos2unix $filePathJust adding sh before script name make it work in my case.
