Is it possible to declare a variable in Gradle usable in Java ?\nBasically I would like to declare some vars in the build.gradle and then getting it (obviously) at build time. Just like a pre-processor macros in C/C++...An example of declaration would be something like that ... :Is there a way to do something like that ?You can access them with BuildConfig.FOOYou can access them in the usual way with @string/app_name or R.string.app_namegradle.propertiesbuild.gradleUsage in java codeUsage in xml codeExample using system properties, set in build.gradle, read from Java application (following up from question in comments):Basically, using the test task in build.gradle, with test task method systemProperty setting a system property that\'s passed at runtime:And here\'s the rest of the sample code (which you could probably infer, but is included here anyway):  it gets a system property MY-VAR1, expected at run-time to be set to VALUE-TEST:Testcase: if MY-VAR is unset, the test should fail:Run (note: test is passing):I\'ve found that the tricky part is actually getting the output from gradle... So, logging is configured here (slf4j+logback), and the log file shows the results (alternatively, run gradle --info cleanTest test; there are also properties that get stdout to the console, but, you know, why):If you comment out "systemProperty..." (which, btw, only works in a test task), then:For completeness, here is the logback config (src/test/resources/logback-test.xml):Files:You can create build config field overridable via system environment variables during build:Fallback is used while developing, but you can override the variable when you run the build on Jenkins or another tool.In your app build.gradle:
