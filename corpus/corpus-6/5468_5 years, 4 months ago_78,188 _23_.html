I am trying to rename a file to have different capitalization from what it had before:As you can see, git throws a fit over this. I tried renaming using just the plain old mv command as well but git doesn\'t pick up the rename (as a rename or as a new untracked file).How can I change a file to have a different capitalization of the same name? I am on Mac OS X 10.7.3 with git 1.7.9.1 using zsh 4.3.15.Starting git 2.0.1 (June 25th, 2014), a git mv will just work on case insensitive OS.See commit baa37bf by David Turner (dturner-tw)"git mv hello.txt Hello.txt" on a case insensitive filesystem always triggers "destination already exists" error, because these two names refer to the same path from the filesystem\'s point of view, and requires the user to give "--force" when correcting the case of the path recorded in the index and in the next commit.Detect this case and allow it without requiring "--force".git mv hello.txt Hello.txt just works (no --force required anymore).Considering the answers above, You can get it working with a single command with "--force":Sometimes you want to change the capitalization of a lot of files on OS X. Doing git mv commands will tire quickly, to make things a bit easier this is what I do:Now you can make a commit saying you have changed the file capitalization.File names under OS X are not case sensitive (by default).  This is more of an OS problem than a git problem.  If you remove and re-add the file you should get what you want, or rename it to something else and thn rename it back.As the OP is about "Changing capitalization of filenames in Git":If you are trying to change Capitalisation of a filename in your project, you do not need to force rename it from git. IMO, I would rather change the Capitalisation from my IDE/editor and make sure that I configure git properly to pick up the renaming.By default a git template is set to ignore case(git case insensitive). To verify you have the default template use --get to retrieve the value for a specified key. Use --local and --global to indicate git whether to pick up config key-value from your local git repo config or global one. As, an example if you want to lookup your global key core.ignorecase:If this returns true make sure to set it as:(Make sure you have proper permissions to change global)\nAnd there you have it, now your git would not ignore Capitalisations and treat them as changes.As a suggestion, If you are working on multi-language projects and you feel not all projects should be treated as case-sensitive by git, just update the local core.ignorecaseThis python snippet will git mv --force all files in a directory to be lowercase, ex: foo/Bar.js will become foo/bar.js via git mv foo/Bar.js foo/bar.js --forceModify it to your liking, just figured I\'d share :)To bulk git mv files to lowercase on macOS:It will lowercase all files in a folder.You can open the ".git" directory and then edit the "config" file. Under "[core]" set "ignorecase = true" and you are done ;)
