I know in git, I can use the git diff command to check the changes, but (what I understood is that) it is directory based. This means it gives all the changes of all files on the current directory.How can I check only the changes on one specific file? Say, I have changed file_1.rb, file_2.rb, ..., file_N.rb, but I am only interested in the changes on file file_2.rb. How to check then?I\'d like to check the changes before I commit it.Use a command like:See the git diff documentation for full information on the kinds of things you can get differences for.Normally, git diff by itself shows all the changes in the whole repository (not just the current directory).You can use gitk [filename] to see the changes logAnother method (mentioned in this SO answer) will keep the history in the terminal and give you a very deep track record of the file itself:git log --follow -p -- fileThis will show the entire history of the file (including history beyond renames and with diffs for each change).In other words, if the file named bar was once named foo, then git log -p bar (without the --follow option) will only show the file\'s history up to the point where it was renamed -- it won\'t show the file\'s history when it was known as foo. Using git log --follow -p bar will show the file\'s entire history, including any changes to the file when it was known as foo.You can execute  This will show modified files name and then by copying the interested file path you can see changes using git diffYou can use below command to see who have changed what in a file.git blame <filename>Or if you prefer to use your own gui tool:You can set your gui tool guided by this post:\nHow do I view 'git diff' output with a visual diff program?
