On the website https://code.google.com/apis/console I have registered my application, set up generated Client ID: and Client Secret to my app and tried to log in with Google.\nUnfortunately, I got the error message:What does mean this message, and how can I fix it?\nI use the gem omniauth-google-oauth2.The redirect URI (where the response is returned to) has to be registered in the APIs console, and the error is indicating that you haven\'t done that, or haven\'t done it correctly.Go to the console for your project and look under API Access. You should see your client ID & secret there, along with a list of redirect URIs. If the URI you want isn\'t listed, click edit settings and add the URI to the list. If you\'re using Google+ javascript button, then you have to use postmessage instead of the actual URI. It took me almost the whole day to figure this out since Google\'s docs do not clearly state it for some reason.In my case it was www and non-www URL. Actual site had www URL and the Authorized Redirect URIs in Google Developer Console had non-www URL. Hence, there was mismatch in redirect URI. I solved it by updating Authorized Redirect URIs in Google Developer Console to www URL.Other common URI mismatch are:Here are the step-by-step screenshots of Google Developer Console so that it would be helpful for those who are getting it difficult to locate the developer console page to update redirect URIs.Go to https://console.developers.google.comSelect your ProjectHere is a Google article on creating project and client ID. For my web application i corrected my mistake by writingMake sure to check the protocol "http://" or "https://" as google checks protocol as well.\nBetter to add both URL in the list.This seems quite strange and annoying that no "one" solution is there. \nfor me http://localhost:8000 did not worked out but http://localhost:8000/ worked out.2015July15 - the signin that was working last week with this script on loginstopped working and started causing Error 400  with Error: redirect_uri_mismatchand in the DETAILS section: redirect_uri=storagerelay://...i solved it by changing to:When you register your app at https://code.google.com/apis/console and \nmake a Client ID, you get a chance to specify one or more redirect \nURIs.  The value of the redirect_uri parameter on your auth URI has to \nmatch one of them exactly.The redirect url is case sensitive.In my case I added both:\nhttp://localhost:5023/AuthCallback/IndexAsync\nhttp://localhost:5023/authcallback/indexasyncChecklist:In my case, my credential Application type is "Other". So I can\'t find Authorized redirect URIs in the credentials page. It seems appears in Application type:"Web application". But you can click the Download JSON button to get the client_secret.json file.\nOpen the json file, and you can find the parameter like this: "redirect_uris":["urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob","http://localhost"]. I choose to use http://localhost and it works fine for me.Let me complete @Bazyl\'s answer: in the message I received, they mentioned the URI \n"http://localhost:8080/"\n(which of course, seems an internal google configuration). I changed the authorized URI for that one, \n"http://localhost:8080/" , and the message didn\'t appear anymore... And the video got uploaded... The APIS documentation is VERY lame... Every time I have something working with google apis, I simply feel "lucky", but there\'s a lack of good documentation about it.... :(  Yes, I got it working, but I don\'t yet understand neither why it failed, nor why it worked... There was only ONE place to confirm the URI in the web, and it got copied in the client_secrets.json... I don\'t get if there\'s a THIRD place where one should write the same URI... I find nor only the documentation but also the GUI design of Google\'s api quite lame... Anyone struggling to find where to set redirect urls in the new console: APIs & Auth -> Credentials -> OAuth 2.0 client IDs -> Click the link to find all your redirect urlsRails users (from the omniauth-google-oauth2 docs): Just set the full_host in OmniAuth based on the Rails.env.# config/initializers/omniauth.rbOmniAuth.config.full_host = Rails.env.production? ? \'https://domain.com\' : \'http://localhost:3000\'REMEMBER: Do not include the trailing "/"None of the above solutions worked for me. below didchange authorised Redirect urls to - https://localhost:44377/signin-googleHope this helps someone.beware of the extra / at the end of the url \nhttp://localhost:8000 is different from http://localhost:8000/Try to do these checks:Enjoy :)In my case I had to check the Client ID type for web applications/installed applications.installed applications: http://localhost [Redirect URIs]\nIn this case localhost simply worksweb applications: You need valid domain name [Redirect URIs:]What you need to do is go back to your Developer Console and go to APIs & Auth > Consent Screen and fill that out. Specifically, the product name.Don\'t forget to include the path after your domain and ip.  In my case, I forgot:/oauth2callbackI had two request URIs in the Console, http://xxxxx/client/api/spreadsheet/authredirect and http://localhost. I tried all the top responses to this question and confirmed that none of them were my problem.I removed localhost from the Console, updated my client_secret.json in my project, and the mismatch error went away.If you use this tutorial: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/server-side-flow then you should use "postmessage".In GO this fixed the problem:UPDATED --> WORKING for Android appsJust use:http://localhost/oauth2callbackif you handle your own logic without redirect link for web apps
