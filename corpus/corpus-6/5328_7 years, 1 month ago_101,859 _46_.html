If I have html like this:I\'m trying to use .text() to retrieve just the string "This is some text", but if I were to say $(\'#listItem\').text(), I get "This is some textFirst span textSecond span text".Is there a way to get (and possibly remove, via something like .text("")) just the free text within a tag, and not the text within its child tags?The HTML was not written by me, so this is what I have to work with. I know that it would be simple to just wrap the text in tags when writing the html, but again, the html is pre-written.I liked this reusable implementation based on the clone() method found here to get only the text inside the parent element. Code provided for easy reference:Simple answer:This seems like a case of overusing jquery to me. The following will grab the text ignoring the other nodes:You\'ll need to trim that but it gets you what you want in one, easy line.EDITThe above will get the text node.  To get the actual text, use this:More easiest and quick:Similar to the accepted answer, but without cloning:And here is a jQuery plugin for this purpose:Here is how to use this plugin:isn\'t the code:just becoming jQuery for jQuery\'s sake? When simple operations involve that many chained commands & that much (unnecessary) processing, perhaps it is time to write a jQuery extension:to call:the arguments are in case a different scenario is encountered, such astext will have value:It\'ll need to be something tailored to the needs, which are dependent on the structure you\'re presented with. For the example you\'ve provided, this works:Demo: http://jquery.nodnod.net/cases/2385/runBut it\'s fairly dependent on the markup being similar to what you posted.Try this:Short variant of Stuart answer.or with get()This is an old question but the top answer is very inefficient. Here\'s a better solution:And just do this:just put it in a <p> or <font> and grab that $(\'#listItem font\').text()First thing that came to mindI came up with a specific solution that should be much more efficient than the cloning and modifying of the clone.  This solution only works with the following two reservations, but should be more efficient than the currently accepted solution:With that said, here is the code:I propose to use the createTreeWalker to find all texts elements not attached to html elements (this function can be used to extend jQuery):I presume this would be a fine solution also - if you want to get contents of all text nodes that are direct children of selected element.Note: jQuery documentation uses similar code to explain contents function: https://api.jquery.com/contents/P.S. There\'s also a bit uglier way to do that, but this shows more in depth how things work, and allows for custom separator between text nodes (maybe you want a line break there)This is a good way for meYou can try thisTo be able to trim the result, use DotNetWala\'s like so:I found out that using the shorter version like document.getElementById("listItem").childNodes[0] won\'t work with jQuery\'s trim().Use an extra condition to check if innerHTML and innerText are the same. Only in those cases, replace the text.http://jsfiddle.net/7RSGh/This untested, but I think you may be able to try something like this:http://api.jquery.com/not/I am not a jquery expert, but how about,
