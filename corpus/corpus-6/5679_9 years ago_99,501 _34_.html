I\'d sort of like to use SQLite from within C#.Net, but I can\'t seem to find an appropriate library. Is there one? An official one? Are there other ways to use SQLite than with a wrapper?From https://system.data.sqlite.org:System.Data.SQLite is an ADO.NET adapter for SQLite.System.Data.SQLite was started by Robert Simpson. Robert still has commit privileges on this repository but is no longer an active contributor. Development and maintenance work is now mostly performed by the SQLite Development Team. The SQLite team is committed to supporting System.Data.SQLite long-term."System.Data.SQLite is the original SQLite database engine and a complete ADO.NET 2.0 provider all rolled into a single mixed mode assembly.  It is a complete drop-in replacement for the original sqlite3.dll (you can even rename it to sqlite3.dll).  Unlike normal mixed assemblies, it has no linker dependency on the .NET runtime so it can be distributed independently of .NET."It even supports Mono.Here are the ones I can find:Sources:There\'s also now this option: http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/ - a complete port of SQLite to C#.The folks from sqlite.org have taken over the development of the ADO.NET provider:From their homepage:This is a fork of the popular ADO.NET\n  4.0 adaptor for SQLite known as System.Data.SQLite. The originator of\n  System.Data.SQLite, Robert Simpson, is\n  aware of this fork, has expressed his\n  approval, and has commit privileges on\n  the new Fossil repository. The SQLite\n  development team intends to maintain\n  System.Data.SQLite moving forward.Historical versions, as well as the\n  original support forums, may still be\n  found at\n  http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com, though\n  there have been no updates to this\n  version since April of 2010.The complete list of features can be found at on their wiki. Highlights include Released DLLs can be downloaded directly from the site.I\'d definitely go with System.Data.SQLite (as previously mentioned: http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/)It is coherent with ADO.NET (System.Data.*), and is compiled into a single DLL.  No sqlite3.dll - because the C code of SQLite is embedded within System.Data.SQLite.dll.  A bit of managed C++ magic. sqlite-net is an open source, minimal library to allow .NET and Mono applications to store data in SQLite 3 databases. More information at the wiki page.It is written in C# and is meant to be simply compiled in with your projects. It was first designed to work with MonoTouch on the iPhone, but has grown up to work on all the platforms (Mono for Android, .NET, Silverlight, WP7, WinRT, Azure, etc.).It is available as a Nuget package, where it is the 2nd most popular SQLite package with over 60,000 downloads as of 2014.sqlite-net was designed as a quick and convenient database layer. Its design follows from these goals:Non-goals include:Mono comes with a wrapper. https://github.com/mono/mono/tree/master/mcs/class/Mono.Data.Sqlite/Mono.Data.Sqlite_2.0 gives code to wrap the actual SQLite dll ( http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-shell-win32-x86-3071300.zip found on the download page http://www.sqlite.org/download.html/ ) in a .net friendly way. It works on Linux or Windows.This seems the thinnest of all worlds, minimizing your dependence on third party libraries. If I had to do this project from scratch, this is the way I would do it.Version 1.2 of Monotouch includes support for System.Data. You can find more details here:\nhttp://monotouch.net/Documentation/System.DataBut basically it allows you to use the usual ADO .NET patterns with sqlite.http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/sqlite/dotConnect for SQLite is an enhanced data provider for SQLite that builds on ADO.NET technology to present a complete solution for developing SQLite-based database applications. As a part of the Devart database application development framework, dotConnect for SQLite offers both high performance native connectivity to the SQLite database and a number of innovative development tools and technologies.dotConnect for SQLite introduces new approaches for designing application architecture, boosts productivity, and leverages database application implementation.I use the standard version,it works perfect :)A barebones wrapper of the functions as provided by the sqlite library. Latest version supports functions provided sqlite library 3.7.10SQLiteWrapper projectMicrosoft now provides Microsoft.Data.Sqlite as a first-party SQLite solution for .NET, which is provided as part of ASP.NET Core. The license is the Apache License, Version 2.0.* Disclaimer: I have not actually tried using this myself yet, but there is some documentation provided on Microsoft Docs here for using it with .NET Core and UWP.
