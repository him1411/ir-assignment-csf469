Given an array [1, 2, 3, 4], how can I find the sum of its elements? (In this case, the sum would be 10.)I thought $.each might be useful, but I\'m not sure how to implement it.In Lisp, this\'d be exactly the job for reduce. You\'d see this kind of code:Fortunately, in JavaScript, we also have reduce! Unfortunately, + is an operator, not a function. But we can make it pretty! Here, look:Isn\'t that pretty? :-)Even better! If you\'re using ECMAScript 2015 (aka ECMAScript 6), it can be this pretty:Why not reduce? It\'s usually a bit counter intuitive, but using it to find a sum is pretty straightforward:This is possible by looping over all items, and adding them on each iteration to a sum-variable.JavaScript doesn\'t know block scoping, so sum will be accesible:The same as above, however annotated and prepared as a simple function:Reference: Array.prototype.reduce()This will take on average 1.57 ms/run (measured over 1000 runs on an array of 100 random normal numbers), compared to 3.604 ms/run with the eval() method above and 2.151 ms/run with a standard for(i,length,++) loop.Methodology note: this test was run on a Google Apps Script server, so their javascript engines are pretty much the same as Chrome.EDIT: --i instead of i-- saves 0.12 ms each run (i-- is 1.7)EDIT: Holy expletive, never mind this whole post. Use the reduce() method mentioned above, it\'s only 1 ms/run.If you happen to be using Lodash you can use the sum functionFunny approach:You can also use reduceRight.which results output as 21.Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/ReduceRightAnyone looking for a functional oneliner like me? Take this:A standard JavaScript solution:This works for me (the result should be 5). I hope there is no hidden disadvantage in this kind of solution.I am a beginner with JavaScript and coding in general, but I found that a simple and easy way to sum the numbers in an array is like this: Basically, I wanted to contribute this because I didn\'t see many solutions that don\'t use built in functions, and this method is easy to write and understand.A short piece of JavaScript code would do this job:That way you can put all kinds of exotic things in the array.I\'m only half joking.Array.prototype.reduce can be used to iterate through the array, adding the current element value to the sum of the previous element values.We can use eval to execute a string representation of JavaScript code. Using the Array.prototype.join function to convert the array to a string, we change [1,2,3] into "1+2+3", which evaluates to 6.This way is dangerous if the array is built from user input as it may be exploited eg: eval([1,"2;alert(\'Malicious code!\')"].join(\'+\'))will result in an alert with the text Malicious code. The only reason I have included this is as an answer Ortund\'s question as I do not think it was clarified and I cannot add comments yet.Those are really great answers, but just in case if the numbers are in sequence like in the question ( 1,2,3,4) you can easily do that by applying the formula \n(n*(n+1))/2 where n is the last numberCool tricks here, I\'ve got a nit pick with a lot of the safe traditional answers not caching the length of the array.Without caching the length of the array the JS compiler needs to go through the array with every iteration of the loop to calculate the length, it\'s unnecessary overhead in most cases.  V8 and a lot of modern browsers optimize this for us, so it is less of a concern then it was, but there are older devices that benefit from this simple caching.If the length is subject to change, caching\'s that could cause some unexpected side effects if you\'re unaware of why you\'re caching the length, but for a reusable function who\'s only purpose is to take an array and add the values together it\'s a great fit.Here\'s a CodePen link for this arraySum function.\nhttp://codepen.io/brandonbrule/pen/ZGEJyVIt\'s possible this is an outdated mindset that\'s stuck with me, but I don\'t see a disadvantage to using it in this context.Use reduceThis is much easierUse recursionThe best way to get sum of the array in my opinion.try this...Vanilla JavaScript is all you need:So, try some iteration for the win, it\'s simple. The best part is you DON\'T have to know HOW LONG the array is, so it\'s easy and useful when you use the "for loop" to get the result. Use map:You could potentially add the method to the Array prototype.Then you can use it on any Array like so:
