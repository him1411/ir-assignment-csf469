While helping a friend with a git problem today, I had to introduce a\nbranch that needed to be totally separate from the master branch.\nThe contents of this branch really had a different origin from what\nhad been developed on the master branch, but they were going to be\nmerged into the master branch at a later time.I remembered from reading John Wiegley\'s Git from the bottom\nup how\nbranches are essentially a label to a commit that follows a certain\nconvention and how a commit is tied to a tree of files and, optionally\nto parent commits. We went to create a parentless commit to the\nexisting repository using git\'s plumbing:So we got rid of all files in the index ...... extracted directories and files from a tarball, added those to the\nindex ...... and created a tree object ...(git-write-tree told us the sha1sum of the created tree object.)Then, We committed the tree, without specifying parent commits...(git-commit-tree told us the sha1sum of the created commit object.)... and created a new branch that points to our newly created\ncommit.Finally, we returned to the master branch to continue work there.This seems to have worked as planned. But this is clearly not the kind\nof procedure I would recommend to someone who is just getting started\nusing git, to put it mildly. Is there an easier way of creating a\nnew branch that is entirely unrelated to everything that has happened\nin the repository so far?There is a new feature (since V1.7.2) which makes this task a little more high-level than what\'s in any of the other answers.git checkout now supports the --orphan option. From the man page:git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] --orphan <new_branch> [<start_point>]Create a new orphan branch, named\n  <new_branch>, started from\n  <start_point> and switch to it. The\n  first commit made on this new branch\n  will have no parents and it will be\n  the root of a new history totally\n  disconnected from all the other\n  branches and commits.This doesn\'t do exactly what the asker wanted, because it populates the index and the working tree from <start_point> (since this is, after all, a checkout command). The only other action necessary is to remove any unwanted items from the working tree and index. Unfortunately, git reset --hard doesn\'t work, but git rm -rf . can be used instead (I believe this is equivalent to rm .git/index; git clean -fdx given in other answers).In summary:I left <start_point> unspecified because it defaults to HEAD, and we don\'t really care anyway. This sequence does essentially the same thing as the command sequence in Artem\'s answer, just without resorting to scary plumbing commands. From Git Community Book:Although the solution with git symbolic-ref and removing index works, it might be conceptually cleaner to create new repositorythen fetch from itNow you can delete /path/to/unrelatedGithub has a feature called Project Pages where you can create a particular named branch in your project to provide files that will be served by Github. Their instructions are as follows:From there you have an empty repository which you can then add your new content to.The currently selected answer is correct, I would just add that coincidentally...This is actually exactly how github.com lets users create Github Pages for their repos, thru an orphaned branch called gh-pages.\nThe pretty steps are given and explained here:https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manuallyHope this helps!Sometimes I just want to create empty branch in project instantly then start doing work, I will just excute following command : Found this script at http://wingolog.org/archives/2008/10/14/merging-in-unrelated-git-branches and it works very fine !
