In Swift 2, I was able to use dispatch_after to delay an action using grand central dispatch:But this no longer seems to compile in Swift 3. What is the preferred way to write this in Swift 3 (using the new Dispatch API)?The syntax is simply:Note, the above syntax of adding seconds as a Double seems to be a source of confusion (esp since we were accustomed to adding nsec). That "add seconds as Double" syntax works because deadline is a DispatchTime and, behind the scenes, there is a + operator that will take a Double and add that many seconds to the DispatchTime:But, if you really want to add an integer number of msec, \xce\xbcs, or nsec to the DispatchTime, you can also add a DispatchTimeInterval to a DispatchTime. That means you can do:These all seamlessly work because of this separate overload method for the + operator in the DispatchTime class.Swift 3:For the time .seconds(Int), .microseconds(Int) and .nanoseconds(Int) may also be used.If you just want the delay function inswift 3 xcode 8 beta 3swift 3 xcode 8 beta 4You can use it like:after Swift 3 release, also the @escaping has to be addedcall DispatchQueue.main.after(when: DispatchTime, execute: () -> Void)I\'d highly recommend using the Xcode tools to convert to Swift 3 (Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax). It caught this for me This worked for me in Swift 3You can create a performAfter function which uses Swift 3 DispatchAfter function internallyand use You can use
