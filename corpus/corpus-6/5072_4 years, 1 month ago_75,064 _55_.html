Not in a Git repo, but rather in GitHub specifically - how do I search just the commit messages of a specific repo/branch?As of 2017 it\'s a functionality included in the GitHub itself.\nYou used to be able to do this, but Github removed this feature at some point mid-2013.  To achieve this locally, you can do:(Use the -g flag if you want to search other branches and dangling commits.)Update (2017/01/05):\nGithub has published an update that allows you now to search within commit messages from within their UI. See blog post for more information.I had the same question and contacted someone @Github yesterday:Since they switched their search engine to ElasticSearch it\'s not possible to search for commit messages using the Github UI. But that feature is on the team\'s wishlist.Unfortunately there\'s no release date for that function right now.The short answer is, you cannot search commit messages directly on github.com the website. For the time being we recommend the local git grep solution others on this thread have proposed.At one point in time GitHub did offer a git grep style search over commit messages for a single repository. Unfortunately, this approach exposed a denial of service that could render a file server inaccessible. For this reason, we removed git grep searching.Current back-of-the envelope estimates puts the number of commits in GitHub somewhere around the 80 billion mark. Although Google engineers laugh behind our backs, this is a rather large number of documents to store in ElasticSearch. We\'d love to make this dataset searchable, but it is not a trivial project.This was removed from GitHub. I use:You can also filter by author:From the help page on searching code, it seems that this isn\'t yet possible.You can search for text in your repo, including the ability to choose files or paths to search in, but you can\'t specify that you want to search in commits.Maybe suggest this to them?You can do this with repos that have been crawled by google (results vary from repo to repo)Search all branches of all crawled repos for "change license""change license" site:https://github.com/*/*/commitsSearch master branch of all crawled repos for "change license""change license" site:https://github.com/*/*/commits/masterSearch master branch of all crawled twitter repos for "change license""change license" site:https://github.com/twitter/*/commits/masterSearch all branches of twitter/some_project repo for "change license""change license" site:https://github.com/twitter/some_project/commitsUpdate January 2017 (two years later): You can now search for commit messages! (still only in the master branch)February 2015: Not sure that could ever be possible, considering the current search infrastructure base on Elasticsearch (introduced in January 2013).As an answer "drawing from credible and/or official sources", here is an interview done with the GitHub people in charge of introducing Elasticsearch at GitHub (August 2013)Tim Pease: We have two document types in there: One is a source code file and the other one is a repository. The way that git works is you have commits and you have a branch for each commit. Repository documents keep track of the most recent commit for that particular repository that has been indexed. When a user pushes a new commit up to Github, we then pull that repository document from elasticsearch. We then see the most recently indexed commit and then we get a list of all the files that had been modified, or added, or deleted between this recent push and what we have previously indexed. Then we can go ahead and just update those documents which have been changed. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to re-index the entire source code tree every time someone pushes.Andrew Cholakian: So, you guys only index, I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming, the master branch.Tim Pease: Correct. It\xe2\x80\x99s only the head of the master branch that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get in there and still that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of data, two billion documents, 30 terabytes.Andrew Cholakian: That is awesomely huge.Tim Pease: With indexing source code on push, it\xe2\x80\x99s a self-healing process.\n  We have that repository document which keeps track of the last indexed commit. If we missed, just happen to miss three commits where those jobs fail, the next commit that comes in, we\xe2\x80\x99re still looking at the diff between the previous commit that we indexed and the one that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing with this new push.\n  You do a git diff and you get all the files that have been updated, deleted, or added. You can just say, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, we need to remove these files. We need to add these files, and all that.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s self-healing and that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that we have taken with pretty much all of the architecture.That all means not all the branches of all the repo would be indexed with that approach.\nA global commit message search isn\'t available for now.\nAnd Tim Pease himself confirms commit messages are not indexed.Note that it isn\'t impossible to get one\'s own elasticsearch local indexing of a local clone: see "Searching a git repository with ElasticSearch"But for a specific repo, the easiest remains to clone it and do a:(More options at "How to search a Git repository by commit message?")Since this has been removed from Github, I\'ve been using gitk on Linux to do this.From terminal go to your repository and type gitkIn the middle of the gui, theres\'s a search box. It provides a good selection of filters:Scope - containing, touching paths, adding/removing string, changing line matchingMatch type - Exact/IgnCase/RegexpSearch fields - All fields/Headline/Comments/CommitterThis works well from within eclipse, until github adds the feature:https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Searching_for_commitsIf you\'re working on Ubuntu (or perhaps other Unix OSes) and have a local version of the repo, you might want to try this crude shell script I wrote to open the GitHub pages for all commits matching your search term in new tabs in your default browser:Just replace https://github.com/RepoOwnerUserName/RepoName/ with the actual Github URL of your repo, save the script somewhere (e.g. as githubsearch.sh, make it executable (chmod +x githubsearch.sh) and then add the following alias to your ~/.bashrc file:Then, from anywhere in your git repo, just do this at the terminal:and any commits that match your (case insensitive) search term will have their corresponding GitHub pages opened in your browser. (Be warned that if your search term appears in hundreds of commits, this may well crash your browser and eat your PC\'s CPU for a while.)I\'ve only tested this on Ubuntu and don\'t know enough about shell scripting to know whether this will work on other Unix-based OSes - particularly I don\'t know whether anything I\'ve used here is Bash-specific. Feel free to comment or edit to add compatibility info.
