I have a script that prints the current date and time in JavaScript, but the DATEis allways wrong. Here is the code:It should print 18/04/2012 15:07:33 and prints 3/3/2012 15:07:33Any help? ThanksWhen calling .getMonth() you need to add +1 to display the correct month.\nJavascript count always starts at 0 (look here to check why), so calling .getMonth() in may will return 4 and not 5. So in your code we can use currentdate.getMonth()+1 to output the correct value. In addition:so your code should look like this:JavaScript Date instances inherit from Date.prototype. You can modify the constructor\'s prototype object to affect properties and methods inherited by JavaScript Date instancesYou can make use of the prototype constructor for the Date object and create a new method of the Date object to return today\'s date and time. These new methods or properties will be inherited by all instances of the Date object thus making it especially useful if you need to re-use this functionality.You can then simply retrieve the date and time by doing the following:Or call the method inline so it would simply be -To get time and date you should use To get only the date you should use To get only the time you should use Or if you just want the time in the format hh:mm without AM/PM for US Englishor for British EnglishRead more here.If you want true mysql style date time use this2013/10/04 08:51:32Just use:Change .getDay() method to .GetDate() and add one to month, because it counts months from 0.You need to use getDate() to get the date part. The getDay() function returns the day number (Sunday = 0, Monday = 1...), and the getMonth() returns a 0 based index, so you need to increment it by 1.This should do the trick:get current date and timegetDay() gets the day of the week.  3 is Wednesday.  You want getDate(), that will return 18.Also getMonth() starts at 0, you need to add 1 to get 4 (April).DEMO: http://jsfiddle.net/4zVxp/.getDay returns day of week. You need .getDate instead.\n.getMonth returns values from 0 to 11. You\'ll need to add 1 to the result to get "human" month number.This little code is easy and works everywhere.there is room to designThis question is quite old and the answers are too. Instead of those monstrous functions, we now can use moment.js to get the current date, which actually makes it very easy. All that has to be done is including moment.js in our project and get a well formated date, for example, by:I think that makes it way easier to handle dates in javascript.I have found the simplest way to get current date and time in JavaScript from here - How to get current Date and Time using JavaScriptMy well intended answer is to use this tiny bit of JS: https://github.com/rhroyston/clock-jsI think i am very late to share my answer, but i think it will be worth.console.log(__getCurrentDateTime(\'h:mi:ss ampm\'));    //return in 1:5:30 PMI needed to figure this out for a slate in after effects. Here\'s what I came up with after taking elements from a few different sources -- Formatting is MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM AM/PMIts simple and superbplease find the below fiddler for the examplehttp://jsfiddle.net/4zVxp/483/Check this out may be it will work for you
