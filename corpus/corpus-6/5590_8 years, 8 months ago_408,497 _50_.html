I\'m setting up a database using phpMyAdmin. I have two tables (foo and bar), indexed on their primary keys. I am trying to create a relational table (foo_bar) between them, using their primary keys as foreign keys.I created these tables as MyISAM, but have since changed all three to InnoDB, because I read that MyISAM doesn\'t support foreign keys. All id fields are INT(11).When I choose the foo_bar table, click the "relation view" link, and try to set the FK columns to be database.foo.id and database.bar.id, it says "No index defined!" beside each column.What am I missing?For the sake of simplicity, I want to keep using phpMyAdmin. I am currently using XAMPP, which is easy enough to let me focus on the PHP/CSS/Javascript, and it comes with phpMyAdmin.Also, although I haven\'t been able to set up explicit foreign keys yet, I do have a relational table and can perform joins like this:It just makes me uncomfortable not to have the FKs explicitly defined in the database.If you want to use phpMyAdmin to set up relations, you have to do 2 things. First of all, you have to define an index on the foreign key column in the referring table (so foo_bar.foo_id, in your case). Then, go to relation view (in the referring table) and select the referred column (so in your case foo.id) and the on update and on delete actions.I think foreign keys are useful if you have multiple tables linked to one another, in particular, your delete scripts will become very short if you set the referencing options correctly.EDIT: Make sure both of the tables have the InnoDB engine selected.phpMyAdmin lets you define foreign keys using their "relations" view. But since, MySQL only supports foreign constraints on "INNO DB" tables, the first step is to make sure the tables you are using are of that type.To setup a foreign key so that the PID column in a table named CHILD references the ID column in a table named PARENT, you can do the following:By doing an export on the CHILD table, you should see a foreign key constraint has been created for the PID column.This is a summary of a Wikipedia article. It specifies the different types of relationships you can stipulate in PHPmyadmin. I am putting it here because it is relevant to @Nathan\'s comment on setting the foreign keys options for "on update/delete" but is too large for a comment - hope it helps.CASCADEWhenever rows in the master (referenced) table are deleted (resp. updated), the respective rows of the child (referencing) table with a matching foreign key column will get deleted (resp. updated) as well. This is called a cascade delete (resp. update[2]).RESTRICTA value cannot be updated or deleted when a row exists in a foreign key table that references the value in the referenced table. Similarly, a row cannot be deleted as long as there is a reference to it from a foreign key table.NO ACTIONNO ACTION and RESTRICT are very much alike. The main difference between NO ACTION and RESTRICT is that with NO ACTION the referential integrity check is done after trying to alter the table. RESTRICT does the check before trying to execute the UPDATE or DELETE statement. Both referential actions act the same if the referential integrity check fails: the UPDATE or DELETE statement will result in an error.SET NULLThe foreign key values in the referencing row are set to NULL when the referenced row is updated or deleted. This is only possible if the respective columns in the referencing table are nullable. Due to the semantics of NULL, a referencing row with NULLs in the foreign key columns does not require a referenced row.SET DEFAULTSimilar to SET NULL, the foreign key values in the referencing row are set to the column default when the referenced row is updated or deleted.In phpmyadmin, you can assign Foreign key simply by its GUI. Click on the table and go to Structure tab. find the Relation  View on just bellow of table (shown in below image). You can assign the forging key from the list box near by the primary key.(See image below). and savecorresponding SQL query automatically generated and executed.For those new to database .... and need to ALTER an existing table. A lot things seem to be pretty straightforward, but there is always something ... between A and B. Before anything else, take a look at this. Go to SQL tab (I am using phpMyAdmin, should be similar in other ones) and do this command:ALTER TABLE child_table_name\nADD FOREIGN KEY (P_ID)\nREFERENCES parent_table_name (P_ID)Click on child table, than structure, finally on relational view. Finish your DB planning there. There was a nice answer before this one about cascade, restrict, etc. \nOf course it could be done by commands...Foreign key means a non prime attribute of a table referes the prime attribute of another\n*in phpMyAdmin* first set the column you want to set foreign key as an index then click on RELATION VIEWthere u can find the options to set foreign keyInnoDB allows you to add a new foreign key constraint to a table by using ALTER TABLE:On the other hand, if MyISAM has advantages over InnoDB in your context, why would you want to create foreign key constraints at all. You can handle this on the model level of your application. Just make sure the columns which you want to use as foreign keys are indexed!Don\'t forget that the two columns should have the same data type.for example if one column is of type INT and the other is of type tinyint you\'ll get the following error:Error creating foreign key on [PID column] (check data types)Step 1:\nYou have to add the line:\ndefault-storage-engine = InnoDB \nunder the [mysqld] section of your mysql config file (my.cnf or my.ini depending on your OS) and restart the mysqld service.\nStep 2:\nNow when you create the table you will see the type of table is: InnoDBStep 3:\nCreate both Parent and Child table.
