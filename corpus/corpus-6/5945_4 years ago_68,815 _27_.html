What is the difference between FragmentPagerAdapter and FragmentStatePagerAdapter?About FragmentPagerAdapter Google\'s guide says:This version of the pager is best for use when there are a handful of\n  typically more static fragments to be paged through, such as a set of\n  tabs. The fragment of each page the user visits will be kept in\n  memory, though its view hierarchy may be destroyed when not visible.\n  This can result in using a significant amount of memory since fragment\n  instances can hold on to an arbitrary amount of state. For larger sets\n  of pages, consider FragmentStatePagerAdapter.And about FragmentStatePagerAdapter:This version of the pager is more useful when there are a large number\n  of pages, working more like a list view. When pages are not visible to\n  the user, their entire fragment may be destroyed, only keeping the\n  saved state of that fragment. This allows the pager to hold on to much\n  less memory associated with each visited page as compared to\n  FragmentPagerAdapter at the cost of potentially more overhead when\n  switching between pages.So I have just 3 fragments. But all of them is a separate module with large amount of data. \nFragment1 handle some data (which user enter) and via activity pass it into Fragment2, which is just simple ListFragment. Fragment3 is also ListFragment.So my questions are: Which adapter should I use? FragmentPagerAdapter or FragmentStatePagerAdapter?I would greatly appreciate for your help. Alex. P.S. Sorry for my English:)Like the docs say, think about it this way. If you were to do an application like a book reader, you will not want to load all the fragments into memory at once. You would like to load and destroy Fragments as the user reads. In this case you will use FragmentStatePagerAdapter. If you are just displaying 3 "tabs" that do not contain a lot of heavy data (like Bitmaps), then FragmentPagerAdapter might suit you well. Also, keep in mind that ViewPager by default will load 3 fragments into memory. The first Adapter you mention might destroy View hierarchy and re load it when needed, the second Adapter only saves the state of the Fragment and completely destroys it, if the user then comes back to that page, the state is retrieved.FragmentPagerAdapter stores the whole fragment in memory, and could\nincrease a memory overhead if a large amount of fragments are used in\nViewPager.In contrary its sibling, FragmentStatePagerAdapter only stores the\nsavedInstanceState of fragments, and destroys all the fragments when\nthey lose focus.Therefore FragmentStatePagerAdapter should be used when we have to\nuse dynamic fragments, like fragments with widgets, as their data\ncould be stored in the savedInstanceState.Also it wont affect the performance even if there are large number of\nfragments. In contrary its sibling FragmentPagerAdapter should be    used when\nwe need to store the whole fragment in memory.When I say the whole fragment is kept in memory it means, its\ninstances wont be destroyed and would create a memory overhead.\nTherefore it is advised to use FragmentPagerAdapter only when there\nare low number of fragments for ViewPager.It would be even better if the fragments are static, since they would\nnot be having large amount of objects whose instances would be\nstored.To be more detail,FragmentStatePagerAdapter:with FragmentStatePagerAdapter,your unneeded fragment is\ndestroyed.A transaction is committed to completely remove the\nfragment from your activity\'s FragmentManager.The state in FragmentStatePagerAdapter comes from the fact that it\nwill save out your fragment\'s Bundle from savedInstanceState when\nit is destroyed.When the user navigates back,the new fragment will be\nrestored using the fragment\'s state.FragmentPagerAdapter:By comparision FragmentPagerAdapter does nothing of the kind.When\nthe fragment is no longer needed.FragmentPagerAdapter calls\ndetach(Fragment) on the transaction instead of remove(Fragment).This destroy\'s the fragment\'s view but leaves the fragment\'s instance\nalive in the FragmentManager.so the fragments created in the\nFragmentPagerAdapter are never destroyed.Something that is not explicitly said in the documentation or in the answers on this page (even though implied by @Naruto), is that FragmentPagerAdapter will not update the Fragments if the data in the Fragment changes because it keeps the Fragment in memory.So even if you have a limited number of Fragments to display, if you want to be able to refresh your fragments (say for example you re-run the query to update the listView in the Fragment), you need to use FragmentStatePagerAdapter.My whole point here is that the number of Fragments and whether or not they are similar is not always the key aspect to consider. Whether or not your fragments are dynamic is also key.FragmentPagerAdapter stores the previous data which is fetched from the adapter while FragmentStatePagerAdapter takes the new value from the adapter everytime it is executed.FragmentStatePagerAdapter = To accommodate a large number of fragments in ViewPager. As this adapter destroys the fragment when it is not visible to the user and only savedInstanceState of the fragment is kept for further use. This way a low amount of memory is used and a better performance is delivered in case of dynamic fragments.
