I need to send a CSV file in HTTP response. How can I set the output response as CSV format?This is not working:Using text/csv is the most appropriate type.You should also consider adding a Content-Disposition header to the response.  Often a text/csv will be loaded by a Internet Explorer directly into a hosted instance of Excel.  This may or may not be a desirable result.The above will cause a file "Save as" dialog to appear which may be what you intend.MIME type of the CSV is text/csv according to RFC 4180.Over the years I\'ve been honing a perfect set of headers for this that work brilliantly in all browsers that I know ofUse text/csv as the content type.Try one of these other mime-types (from here: http://filext.com/file-extension/CSV )Also, the mime-type might be case sensitive...Just Use like thatIn ASP.net MVC, you can use a FileContentResult and the File method:Setting the content type and the content disposition as described above produces wildly varying results with different browsers:IE8: SaveAs dialog as desired, and Excel as the default app.  100% good.Firefox: SaveAs dialog does show up, but Firefox has no idea it is a spreadsheet.  Suggests opening it with Visual Studio!  50% goodChrome: the hints are fully ignored.  The CSV data is shown in the browser.  0% good.Of course in all of these cases I\'m referring to the browsers as they come out of they box, with no customization of the mime/application mappings.I suggest to insert an \'/\' character in front of \'myfilename.cvs\'I hope you get better results.I have found that the problem with IE is that it sniffs the return data and makes up its own mind about what content-type it thinks it has been sent. There are a number of side effect that this causes, such as always openning a saveAs dialog for text files because you are using compression of data trasnferes. The solution is (in php code)......
