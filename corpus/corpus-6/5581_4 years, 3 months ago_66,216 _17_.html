I am still quite new to programming, and I was googling this question and I do not seem to get a straight answer. I googled what a cache was and I understand it is an encrypted file of similar files (a bit of a convoluted paraphrase but I think some will agree it is accurate). What, as a programmer, do we do with the folder __pycache__? Is it what we give people instead of our source code? Is it just data I have input? This folder keeps getting created and I am wondering what it is for... When you run a program in python, the interpreter compiles it to bytecode first (this is an oversimplification) and stores it in the __pycache__ folder. If you look in there you will find a bunch of files sharing the names of the .py files in your project\'s folder, only their extentions will be either .pyc or .pyo. These are bytecode-compiled and optimized bytecode-compiled versions of your program\'s files, respectively.As a programmer, you can largely just ignore it... All it does is make your program start a little faster. When your scripts change, they will be recompiled, and if you delete the files or the whole folder and run your program again, they will reappear (unless you specifically suppress that behavior)If you are using cpython (which is the most common, as it\'s the reference implementation) and you don\'t want that folder, then you can suppress it by starting the interpreter with the -B flag, for example Another option, as noted by tcaswell, is to set the environment variable PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE to any value (according to python\'s man page, any "non empty string").__pycache__ is a folder containing Python 3 bytecode compiled and ready to be executed.Don\'t bother deleting these files nor suppress creation. It\'s pointless and will actually hurt performance.Python programmers usually ignore bytecode. Indeed __pycache__ and *.pyc are common lines to see in .gitignore files. Bytecode is not meant for distribution and can be disassembled using dis module. If you are using OS X you can easily hide all of these folders in your project by running following command from the root folder of your project.Replace __pycache__ with *.pyc for Python 2.This sets a flag on all those directories (.pyc files) telling  Finder/Textmate 2 to exclude them from listings.Rerun the command if you create new modules and wish to hide new bytecode or if you delete the hidden bytecode files.On Windows the equivalent command might be (not tested, batch script welcome):Which is same as going through the project hiding folders using right-click > hide...In 3.2 and later, Python saves its .pyc byte code files in a sub-directory named pycache located in the directory where your source files reside and in files whose names identify the Python version that created them(e.g. script.cpython-33.pyc)
