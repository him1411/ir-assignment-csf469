I want to have 5 equal columns on a page I am building and I can\'t seem to understand how the 5 column grid is being used here:\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20120416024539/http://domain7.com/mobile/tools/bootstrap/responsiveIs the five column grid being demonstrated above part of the twitter bootstrap framework?Use five divs with a class of span2 and give the first a class of offset1.Voila!\nFive equally spaced and centered columns.In bootstrap 3.0, this code would look likeA fantastic full width 5 columns layout with Twitter Bootstrap was created here.This is by far the most advanced solution since it works seamlessly with Bootstrap 3. It allows you to re-use the classes over and over again, in pair with the current Bootstrap classes for responsive design.CSS:\nAdd this to your global stylesheet, or even to the bottom of your bootstrap.css document.Put it to use!For example, if you want to create a div element that behaves like a five column layout on medium screens and like two columns on smaller ones, you just need to use something like this:WORKING DEMO - Expand the frame to see the columns become responsive.ANOTHER DEMO - Incorporating the new col-*-5ths classes with others such as col-*-3 and col-*-2. Resize the frame to see them all change to col-xs-6 in responsive view.Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox by default, so you get access to its magical powers straight out of the box. Check out the auto layout columns that dynamically adjust width depending on how many columns are nested.Here\'s an example:WORKING DEMOFor Bootstrap 3, if you want full-width and are using LESS, SASS, or something similar, all you have to do is make use of Bootstrap\'s mixin functions make-md-column, make-sm-column, etc.LESS:SASS:Not only can you build true full-width bootstrap column classes using these mixins, but you can also build all the related helper classes like .col-md-push-*, .col-md-pull-*, and .col-md-offset-*:LESS:SASS:Other answers talk about setting @gridColumns which is perfectly valid, but that changes the core column width for all of bootstrap. Using the above mixin functions will add 5 column layout on top of the default bootstrap columns, so it will not break any 3rd party tools or existing styling.Below is a combo of @machineaddict and @Mafnah answers, re-written for Bootstrap 3 (working well for me so far):Keep the original bootstrap with 12 columns, do not customize it. The only modification you need to make is some css after the original bootstrap responsive css, like this:The following code has been tested for Bootstrap 2.3.2:And the html:Note: Even though the span2 times 5 doesn\'t equal 12 columns, you get the idea :)A working example can be found here http://jsfiddle.net/v3Uy5/6/Go to Bootstrap 2.3.2 (or Bootstrap 3) customization page and set the following variables (don\'t input semicolons):Download your build. This grid would fit into default containers, preserving default gutter widths (almost).Note: If you are using LESS, update variables.less instead.In case you do no need the exact same width of columns you can try create 5-columns using nesting:jsfiddleThe first two columns will have width equal 5/12 * 1/2 ~ 20.83%The last three columns:  7/12 * 1/3 ~ 19.44%Such hack gives the acceptable result in many cases and does not require any CSS changes (we\'re using only the native bootstrap classes).I voted up Mafnah\'s answer but looking at this again I\'d suggest the following is better if you\'re keeping the default margins etc.With flexbox http://output.jsbin.com/juziwuCreate 5 elements with the class col-sm-2 and add to the first element also the class col-sm-offset-1  P.s. this will not be full width (it will be indented a little from the right and left of the screen)  The code should look something like this Here is 5 equal, full-width columns (no extra CSS or SASS) using the auto-layout grid..http://www.codeply.com/go/MJTglTsq9hThis solution works because Bootstrap 4 is now flexbox. You can get the 5 colums to wrap witin the same .row using a clearfix break such as <div class="col-12"></div> or <div class="w-100"></div> very 5 columns.It can be done with nesting and using a little css over-ride.Then some css}Here is an example: 5 equal column exampleAnd here is my full write up on coderwallFive equal columns in bootstrap 3Another way to enable 5 columns in Bootstrap 3 is to modify the 12 columns format used by default by Bootstrap. And then create a 20 columns grid (use customize on the Bootstrap website OR use the LESS/SASS version).To customize on the bootstrap website, go to Customize and Download page, update variable  @grid-columns from 12 to 20. Then you will be able to create 4 as well as 5 columns. In my opinion it is better to use it like this with Less syntax.\nThis answer is based on the answer from @fizzixThis way columns use variables (@grid-gutter-width, media breakpoints) that user may have overriden and the behavior of five columns matches with behavior of 12 column grid.This is awesome: http://www.ianmccullough.net/5-column-bootstrap-layout/Just do:And CSS:By default Bootstrap does not provide grid system that allows us to create five columns layout, you need to create default column definition in the way that Bootstrap do\ncreate some custom classes and media queries in your css fileand some html codeIn bootstrap 3, I think we can do something like that, for remove left and right margin :and CSSHow You can add 5 columns grid in bootstrapBootstrap by default can scale up to 12 columns? This means if we want to create a 12-column layout of equal width, we would write inside div class="col-md-1" twelve times.the easiest solution without any need to edit CSS would be:And if you need those to break beyond any breakpoint, just make btn-group block. Hope this helps someone.Five columns are clearly not the part of bootstrap by design.But with Bootstrap v4 (alpha), there are 2 things to help with a complicated grid layoutIn simple term, I\'m usingBe it 5,7,9,11,13 or something odds, it\'ll be okay.\nI\'m quite sure that 12-grids standard is able to serve more than 90% of use case - so let\'s design that way - develop more easier too!The nice flex tutorial is here "https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"5 columns layout with Twitter Bootstrap styleA solution that do not require a lot of CSS, nor tweaking bootstrap default 12col layout:http://jsfiddle.net/0ufdyeur/1/HTML:CSS:For twitter bootstrap 3 this is the most simple way to achieve this:An improvisation on @lightswitch\'s answer, if we need a 5 column grid using LESS iterationsThis will generate css classes .col-md-5th-1, col-md-5th-2, col-md-5th-3, and so on which corresponds to 10%, 20%, 30%... respectivelythe bootstrap grid system as parted in 12 grid.So i parted it to two grid (7+5).This 7 and 5 are also contain full 12 grid.Thats why i parted 7(4+4+4) and 5(6+6) so it will take all content,simpleHTMLCSSYou can use the little trick to make the col-md-2 with offsets solution full width. It use the way that bootstrap does to remove(hide) 15px paddings.I mean by adding "-" margins. Actually the calc(-10% - 15px); margins for both side. (10% is the offset width and 15px for the padding).The only minus is it will make the page scroll horizontal so you will need the overflow-x:hidden on the parent of the row.Here is demo: http://jsfiddle.net/sct3j/171/I\'ve created SASS mixin definitions based on bootstrap definitions for any number of columns (personally beside 12 I use 8, 10 and 24):And you can simply create classes by:I hope someone will find it useful
