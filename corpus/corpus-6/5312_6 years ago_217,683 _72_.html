I am trying to get a Python script to run on the linux server I\'m connected to via ssh. The script uses mysqldb. I have all the other components I need, but when I try to install mySQLdb via setuptools like so:, I get the following error report related to the mysql_config command.Has anyone else encountered this error and if so how did you resolve it/what can I do to successfully install mysqldb? mySQLdb is a python interface for mysql, but it is not mysql itself. And apparently mySQLdb needs the command \'mysql_config\', so you need to install that first.Can you confirm that you did or did not install mysql itself, by running "mysql" from the shell? That should give you a response other than "mysql: command not found". Which linux distribution are you using? Mysql is pre-packaged for most linux distributions. For example, for debian / ubuntu, installing mysql is as easy as mysql-config is in a different package, which can be installed from (again, assuming debian / ubuntu):if you are using mariadb, the drop in replacement for mysql, then runI was installing python-mysql on Ubuntu 12.04 using First I had the same problem:This worked for me Then I had this problem:Then I tried withAnd  then I was happy :)The below worked for me on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:All though it worked, i still went ahead to do the below:I got the same error while trying to install mysql-python.This is how I fixed it.The problem was that the installer could not find the mysql_config in the default path. Now it can ..and it worked..Hope this helps.Thanks.I fixed this problem with the following steps:On Red Hat I had to doThen it worked.The commands (mysql too) mPATH might be missing. export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin/I fixed it by installing libmysqlclient:The MySQL-python package is using the mysql_config command to learn about the mysql configuration on your host. Your host does not have the mysql_config command.The MySQL development libraries package package (MySQL-devel-xxx) from dev.mysql.com provides this command and the libraries needed by the MySQL-python package. The MySQL-devel packages are found in the download - community server area. The MySQL development library package names start with MySQL-devel and vary based MySQL version and linux platform (e.g. MySQL-devel-5.5.24-1.linux2.6.x86_64.rpm.)Note that you do not need to install mysql server.I think, following lines can be executed on terminalThis mysql_config directory is for zend server on MacOSx. You can do it for linux like following linesThis is default linux mysql directory. You need to install the python-dev package:For Alpine Linux:$ apk add mariadb-dev mariadb-client mariadb-libsMariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL and became the new standard as of Alpine 3.2. See https://bugs.alpinelinux.org/issues/4264This method is only for those who know that Mysql is installed but still mysql_config can\'t be find. This happens if python install can\'t find mysql_config in your system path, which mostly happens if you have done the installation via .dmg Mac Package or installed at some custom path. The easiest and documented way by MySqlDB is to change the site.cfg. Find the mysql_config which is probably in /usr/local/mysql/bin/ and change the variable namely mysql_config just like below and run the installation again. Don\'t forget to un-comment it by removing "#"Change below line"#mysql_config = /usr/local/bin/mysql_config"to"mysql_config = /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config"depending upon the path in your system. By the way I used python install after changing the site.cfgsudo /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python setup.py installI had this issues and solved if by adding a symlink to mysql_config.  I had installed mysql with homebrew and saw this  in the output.Depending on how you got mysql it will be in different places.  In my case /usr/local/Cellar/mysql\nOnce you know where it is you should be able to ma a symbolic link to where python is looking for it.  /usr/local/mysql This worked for me.  sudo apt-get install python-mysqldbPython 2.5? Sounds like you are using a very old version of Ubuntu Server (Hardy 8.04?) - please confirm which Linux version the server uses.python-mysql search on ubuntu package databaseSome additional info: From the README of mysql-python - Red Hat Linux\n.............MySQL-python is pre-packaged in Red Hat Linux 7.x and newer. This\nincludes Fedora Core and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can also\nbuild your own RPM packages as described above.Debian GNU/Linux\n................Packaged as python-mysqldb_::Or use Synaptic... _python-mysqldb: http://packages.debian.org/python-mysqldbUbuntu\n......Same as with Debian.Footnote: If you really are using a server distribution older than Ubuntu 10.04 then you are out of official support, and should upgrade sooner rather than later.I encountered the same problem, just added the path where *mysql_config* resided to the environment variable PATH and it worked for me.sudo apt-get build-dep python-mysqldb will install all the dependencies to build the package from PIP/easy_installAs actual error isand If you can\'t install python-dev or python-devel packages, you may download archive with needed version of python sources from http://hg.python.org/ and place headers files in proper folder for includeJust type:This will solve this problems.On my Fedora 23 machine I had to run the following:sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev\nsudo apt-get install python-dev\nsudo apt-get install MySQL-pythonNOtice you should install python-dev as well, the packages like MySQL-python are compiled from source. The pythonx.x-dev packages contain the necessary header files for linking against python. Why does installing numpy require python-dev in Kubuntu 12.04
