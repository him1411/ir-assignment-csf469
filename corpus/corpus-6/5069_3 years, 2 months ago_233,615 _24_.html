I tried to install my app into Android L Preview Intel Atom Virtual Device, it failed with error:INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABISWhat does it mean?INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS is when you are trying to install an app that has native libraries and it doesn\'t have a native library for your cpu architecture. For example if you compiled an app for armv7 and are trying to install it on an emulator that uses the Intel architecture instead it will not work. If you using Genymotion you need Installing ARM Translation and GAppsI\'m posting an answer from another thread because it\'s what worked well for me, the trick is to add support for both architectures : Posting this because I could not find a direct answer and had to look at a couple of different posts to get what I wanted done...I was able to use the x86 Accelerated (HAXM) emulator by simply adding this to my Module\'s build.gradle script Inside android{} block:Run (build)... Now there will be a (yourapp)-x86-debug.apk in your output folder. I\'m sure there\'s a way to automate installing upon Run but I just start my preferred HAXM emulator and use command line:INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS is when you are trying to install an app that has native libraries and it doesn\'t have a native library for your cpu architecture.

Pick an ARM virtual device instead, like one of the Custom Tablets.INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS means the architecture is not matched. If you are using a Android Studio on a Mac (which generally uses Apple\'s ARM), then you need to set the Android Virtual Device CPU/ABI to \'arm\' or \'armeabi-v7a\'. If however you are using a Android Studio on a PC (which generally uses Intel\'s chip, then set to \'x86\' or \'x86_64\'.Visual Studio mac - you can change the support here:For genymotion on mac, I was getting INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS error while installing my apk.In my project there wasn\'t any "APP_ABI" but I added it accordingly and it built just one apk for both architectures but it worked.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/35565901/3241111this solution work for me try this,\nadd following lines in your app build.gradle file
