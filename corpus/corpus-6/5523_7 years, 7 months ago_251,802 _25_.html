What is the difference between ArrayList and List<> in C#? Is it only that List<> has a type while ArrayList doesn\'t?Yes, pretty much. List<T> is a generic class. It supports storing values of a specific type without casting to or from object (which would have incurred boxing/unboxing overhead when T is a value type in the ArrayList case). ArrayList simply stores object references. As a generic collection, List<T> implements the generic IEnumerable<T> interface and can be used easily in LINQ (without requiring any Cast or OfType call). ArrayList belongs to the days that C# didn\'t have generics. It\'s deprecated in favor of List<T>. You shouldn\'t use ArrayList in new code that targets .NET >= 2.0 unless you have to interface with an old API that uses it.Using List<T> you can prevent casting errors. It is very useful to avoid a runtime casting error.Example:Here (using ArrayList) you can compile this code but you will see an execution error later.If you use List, you avoid these errors:Reference:\nMSDNTo add to the above points. Using ArrayList in 64bit operating system takes 2x memory than using in the 32bit operating system. Meanwhile, generic list List<T> will use much low memory than the ArrayList.for example if we use a ArrayList of 19MB in 32-bit it would take 39MB in the 64-bit. But if you have a generic list List<int> of 8MB in 32-bit it would take only 8.1MB in 64-bit, which is a whooping 481% difference when compared to ArrayList.Source: ArrayList\xe2\x80\x99s vs. generic List for primitive types and 64-bitsAnother difference to add is with respect to Thread Synchronization. ArrayList provides some thread-safety through the Synchronized property, which returns a thread-safe wrapper around the collection. The wrapper works by locking the entire collection on every add or remove operation. Therefore, each thread that is attempting to access the collection must wait for its turn to take the one lock. This is not scalable and can cause significant performance degradation for large collections.List<T> does not provide any thread synchronization; user code must provide all synchronization when items are added or removed on multiple threads concurrently.More info here Thread Synchronization in the .Net FrameworkArrayList are not type safe whereas List are type safe. Simple :).ArrayList is the collections of different types data whereas List<> is the collection of similar type of its own depedencties.Using "List" you can prevent casting errors. It is very useful to avoid a runtime casting error.Example:Here (using ArrayList) you can compile this code but you will see an execution error later.To me its all about knowing your data. If I am continuing to expand my code on the basis of efficiency, I would have to choose the List option as a way of deciphering of my data w/o the unnecessary step of always wondering about types, especially  \'Custom Types\'. If the machine understands the difference and can determine on it\'s on what type of data I\'m actually dealing with then why should I get in the way and waste time going thru the gyrations of \'IF THEN ELSE\' determinations? My philosophy is to let the machine work for me instead of me working on the machine? Knowing the unique differences of different object code commands goes a long way in making your code as efficient.Tom Johnson\n(One Entry ... One Exit)  It is not only difference. ArrayList members can be accessed via index like ordinary arrays and also ArrayList members can easily sorted in direct and reverse order and two ArrayList can be easily merged, which is not the case with simple List.
