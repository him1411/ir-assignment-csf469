I was wondering if there\'s a way to do something like a PHP foreach loop in JavaSript. The functionality I\'m looking for is something like this: (PHP Snippet)I was looking at the JS for..in loop, but there seems to be no way to specify the as. If I do this with a \'normal\' for loop (for(var i = 0; i < data.length; i++), is there a way to grab the key => value pairs?hasOwnProperty is used to check if your target really has that property, rather than having inherited it from its prototype. A bit simpler would be:It just checks that k is not a method (as if target is array you\'ll get a lot of methods alerted, e.g. indexOf, push, pop,etc.)No one has mentioned Object.keys so I\'ll mention it.The for in will work for you. If you think of an object as a map:The php syntax is just sugar.If you can use ES6 natively or with Babel (js compiler) then you could do the following:Which will print out this output:Hope it helps! =)I assume you know that i is the key and that you can get the value via data[i] (and just want a shortcut for this).ECMAScript5 introduced forEach [MDN] for arrays (it seems you have an array):The MDN documentation provides a shim for browsers not supporting it.Of course this does not work for objects, but you can create a similar function for them:Since you tagged the question with jquery, jQuery provides $.each [docs] which loops over both, array and object structures.You can use the for..in for that.In javascript, every object has a bunch of built-in key-value pairs that have meta-information. When you loop through all the key-value pairs for an object you\'re looping through them too. The use of hasOwnProperty() filters these out.ES6 will provide Map.prototype.forEach(callback) which can be used like thisYou can use a \'for in\' loop for this:Below is an example that gets as close as you get.If you\'re using jQuery see: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/yes, you can have associative arrays also in javascript:
