I\'ve added .DS_Store to the .gitignore file, but it seems that it is only ignoring .DS_Store in the root directory, not in every folder and subfolder.How do I fix this?I think the problem you\'re having is that in some earlier commit, you\'ve accidentally added .DS_Store files to the repository.  Of course, once a file is tracked in your repository, it will continue to be tracked even if it matches an entry in an applicable .gitignore file.You have to manually remove the .DS_Store files that were added to your repository.  You can use git rm --cached .DS_Store.  Once removed, git should ignore it.  You should only need the following line in your root .gitignore file: .DS_Store.  Don\'t forget the period!git rm --cached .DS_Store removes only .DS_Store from the current directory. You can use find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --ignore-unmatch to remove all .DS_Stores from the repository.Felt tip: since you probably never want to include .DS_Store files, make a global rule.  First, make a global .gitignore file somewhere, e.g. echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore_global.  Now tell git to use it for all repositories: git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global.This page helped me answer your question: https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-filesAdd**/.DS_Store into .gitignore for the sub directoryIf .DS_Store already committed:To ignore them in all repository: (sometimes it named ._.DS_Store)Your .gitignore file should look like this:As long as you don\'t include a slash, it is matched against the file name in all directories. (from here)If .DS_Store was never added to your git repository, simply add it to your .gitignore file. If you don\'t have one, create a file calledIn your the root directory of your app and simply writeIn it. This will never allow the .DS_Store file to sneak in your git.But, if it\'s already there, write in your terminal:then commit and push the changes to remove the .DS_Store from your remote repo:And now add .DS_Store to your .gitignore file, and then again commit and push with the 2 last pieces of code (git commit..., git push...)Step 1, delete all the *.DS_store files. One can runbut be aware that rm -f can be a bit dangerous if you have a typo! \nStep two: add to .gitignore. This worked for me!You can also add the --cached flag to auco\'s answer to maintain local .DS_store files, as Edward Newell mentioned in his original answer. The modified command looks like this: find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch ..cheers and thanks!Add *.DS_Store to your .gitignore file. That works for me perfectlyStep :1)Remove the existing files using this commandfind . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatchStep : 2)Add .DS_Store in your .gitignore fileStep :3) Commit your changes in .gitignore\n    git add .gitignore\n    git commit -m "removed .DS_Store"
