I need a live test server that accepts my requests for basic information via HTTP GET and also allows me to POST (even if its really not doing anything). This is entirely for test purposes.A good example is hereit easily accepts GET requests, but I need one that accepts POST requests.Does anyone know of a server that I can send stupid test messages too?http://httpbin.org/It echoes the data used in your request for any of these types:There is http://www.posttestserver.com/"Here you will find a server which receives any POST you wish to give it and stores the contents for you to review."http://requestb.in is similar to the already mentioned tools but has a very nice UI.RequestBin gives you a URL that will collect requests made to it and let you inspect them in a human-friendly way.\n  Use RequestBin to see what your HTTP client is sending or to inspect and debug webhook requests.Have a look at PutsReq, it\'s similar to the others, but it also allows you to write the responses you want using JavaScript.Create choose a free web host and put the following codeOr just visit those sites I have created an open-source hackable local testing server that you can get running in minutes. You can create new API\'s, define your own response and hack it in any ways you wish to.Github Link : https://github.com/prabodhprakash/localTestingServerhttps://www.mockable.io. It has nice feature of getting endpoints without login (24h temporary account)I am not sure if anyone would take this much pain to test GET and POST calls. I took Python Flask module and wrote a function that does something similar to what @Robert shared. When I run this, this follows:Now lets try some calls. I am using the browser. http://127.0.0.1:5000/methodThis is just a GET methodhttp://127.0.0.1:5000/method/NotCorrectThis wish is not available.
