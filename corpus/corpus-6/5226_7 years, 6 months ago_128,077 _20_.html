In Ruby, how do you call a class method from one of that class\'s instances? Say I havethe line Truck.default_make retrieves the default. But is there a way of saying this without mentioning Truck? It seems like there should be.Rather than referring to the literal name of the class, inside an instance method you can just call self.class.whatever.Outputs:Using self.class.blah is NOT the same as using ClassName.blah when it comes to inheritance.To access a class method inside a instance method, do the following:Here is an alternative solution for your problem:Now let\'s use our class:You\'re doing it the right way.  Class methods (similar to \'static\' methods in C++ or Java) aren\'t part of the instance, so they have to be referenced directly.On that note, in your example you\'d be better served making \'default_make\' a regular method:Class methods are more useful for utility-type functions that use the class.  For example:If you have access to the delegate method you can do this:Alternatively, and probably cleaner if you have more then a method or two you want to delegate to class & instance:A word of caution:Don\'t just randomly delegate everything that doesn\'t change state to class and instance because you\'ll start running into strange name clash issues. Do this sparingly and only after you checked nothing else is squashed.Here\'s an approach on how you might implement a _class method that works as self.class for this situation. Note: Do not use this in production code, this is for interest-sake :)From: Can you eval code in the context of a caller in Ruby? and also http://rubychallenger.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/caller-binding.htmlMaybe the right answer is to submit a patch for Ruby :)One more:Similar your question, you could use:
