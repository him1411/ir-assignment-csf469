How do I use a local version of a module in node.js. For example, in my app, I installed coffee-script:This installs it in ./node_modules and the coffee command is in ./node_modules/.bin/coffee. Is there a way to run this command when I\'m in my project\'s main folder? I guess I\'m looking for something similar to bundle exec in bundler. Basically, I\'d like to specify a version of coffee-script that everyone involved with the project should use.I know I can add the -g flag to install it globally so coffee works fine anywhere, but what if I wanted to have different versions of coffee per project?The problem with puttinginto your PATH is that it only works when your current working directory is the root of your project directory structure (i.e. the location of node_modules)Independent of what your working directory is, you can get the path of locally installed binaries withTo execute a locally installed coffee binary independent of where you are in the project directory hierarchy you can use this bash constructI aliased this to npm-execSo, now I canto run the correct copy of coffee no matter of where I amUse the npm bin command to get the node modules /bin directory of your projecte.g.Use npm run[-script] <script name>After using npm to install the bin package to your local ./node_modules directory, modify package.json to add  like this:It would be nice if npm install had a --add-script option or something or if npm run would work without adding to the scripts block.Update: I no longer recommend this method, both for the mentioned security reasons and not the least the newer npm bin command. Original answer below:As you have found out, any locally installed binaries are in ./node_modules/.bin. In order to always run binaries in this directory rather than globally available binaries, if present, I suggest you put ./node_modules/.bin first in your path:If you put this in your ~/.profile, coffee will always be ./node_modules/.bin/coffee if available, otherwise /usr/local/bin/coffee (or whatever prefix you are installing node modules under).Use npm-run.From the readme:Any executable available to an npm lifecycle script is available to npm-run.The PATH solution has the issue that if $(npm bin) is placed in your .profile/.bashrc/etc it is evaluated once and is forever set to whichever directory the path was first evaluated in. If instead you modify the current path then every time you run the script your path will grow. To get around these issues, I create a function and used that. It doesn\'t modify your environment and is simple to use:This can then be used like this without making any changes to your environment:You don\'t have to manipulate $PATH anymore!From npm@5.2.0, npm ships with npx package which lets you run commands from a local node_modules/.bin or from a central cache.Simply run:By default, npx will check whether <command> exists in $PATH, or in the local project binaries, and execute that.Calling npx <command> when <command> isn\'t already in your $PATH will automatically install a package with that name from the NPM registry for you, and invoke it. When it\'s done, the installed package won\xe2\x80\x99t be anywhere in your globals, so you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about pollution in the long-term. You can prevent this behaviour by providing --no-install option.For npm < 5.2.0, you can install npx package manually by running the following command:If you want your PATH variable to correctly update based on your current working directory, add this to the end of your .bashrc-equivalent (or after anything that defines PATH):This may add a short delay every time the bash prompt gets rendered (depending on the size of your project, most likely), so it\'s disabled by default.You can enable and disable it within your terminal by running node-mode and node-mode-off, respectively.Store the following in a file called npm-exec.bat and add it to your %PATH%Then you can use it like \nnpm-exec <command> For exampleTo execute wdio installed in local node_modules directory, do:i.e. it will run  .\\node_modules\\.bin\\wdioI\'d love to know if this is an insecure/bad idea, but after thinking about it a bit I don\'t see an issue here:Modifying Linus\'s insecure solution to add it to the end, using npm bin to find the directory, and making the script only call npm bin when a package.json is present in a parent (for speed), this is what I came up with for zsh:For bash, instead of using the precmd hook, you can use the $PROMPT_COMMAND variable (I haven\'t tested this but you get the idea):You can also use direnv and change the $PATH variable only in your working folder.Add this script to your .bashrc. Then you can call coffee or anyhting locally. This is handy for your laptop, but don\'t use it on your server.note: this script makes aliase of cd command, and after each call of cd it checks node_modules/.bin and add it to your $PATH.note2: you can change the third line to NODE_MODULES=$(npm bin);. But that would make cd command too slow.Same @regular \'s accepted solution, but Fish shell flavourI encountered the same problem and I don\'t particularly like using aliases (as regular\'s suggested), and if you don\'t like them too then here\'s another workaround that I use, you first have to create a tiny executable bash script, say setenv.sh:and then you can then use any executables in your local /bin using this command:If you\'re using scripts in package.json then:zxc is like "bundle exec" for nodejs. It is similar to using PATH=$(npm bin):$PATH:I am a Windows user and this is what worked for me:Good Luck.For Windows use this:In case you are using fish shell and do not want to add to $path for security reason. We can add the below function to run local node executables. Now you can run thing like: n coffeeor more arguments like:n browser-sync --versionNote, if you are bash user, then @Bob9630 answers is the way to go by leveraging bash\'s $@, which is not available in fishshell. If switching to yarn (a npm replacement by facebook) is an option for you, then you can call:scripts inside the package.json will take precedence, if none is found it will look inside the ./node_modules/.bin/ folder.It also outputs what it ran:So you don\'t have to setup scripts for each command in your package.json.If you had a script defined at .scripts inside your package.json:yarn tsc would be equivalent to yarn run tsc or npm run tsc:Include coffee-script in package.json with the specific version required in each project, typically like this:Then run npm install to install dependencies in each project. This will install the specified version of coffee-script which will be accessible locally to each project.
