If there is a repository that I only have git:// access to (and would usually just push+pull), is there a way to rename branches in that repository in the same way that I would do locally with git branch -m?You just have to create a new local branch with the desired name, push it to your remote, and then delete the old remote branch:Then, to see the old branch name, each client of the repository would have to do:NOTE: If your old branch is your main branch, you should change your main branch settings. Otherwise, when you run  $ git push origin :old-branch-name, you\'ll get the error "deletion of the current branch prohibited".If you really just want to rename branches remotely (without renaming any local branches at the same time) you can do this with a single command likeAlso see this script of mine.To integrate @ksrb\'s comment: What this basically does is two pushes in a single command, first git push <remote> <remote>/<old_name>:refs/heads/<new_name> to push a new remote branch based on the old remote tracking branch and then git push <remote> :<old_name> to delete the old remote branch.First checkout to the branch which you want to renameTo remove old branch from remote:Sure. Just rename the branch locally, then push the new branch and push a deletion of the old. The only real issue is that other users of the repo won\'t have local tracking branches renamed.I don\'t know if this is right or wrong, but I pushed the "old name" of the branch to the "new name" of the branch, then deleted the old branch entirely with the following two lines:Adding to the answers already given, here is a version that first checks whether the new branch already exists (so you can safely use it in a script)(the check is from this answer)
