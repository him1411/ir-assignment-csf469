Older versions of pip, e.g. from July 2014, still relied on IncompleteRead. In the current version of pip, the import of IncompleteRead has been removed.So the one to blame is either:You can solve this issue, by either updating pip via Ubuntu (if there is a newer version) or by installing pip aside from Ubuntu.For fixing pip3 (worked on Ubuntu 14.10):Or you can remove all requests.For example:On Ubuntu 14.04 I resolved this by using the pip installation bootstrap script, as described in the documentationThat\'s an OK solution for a development environment.The problem is the Python module requests.

This solved the issue for me. In Windows, this worked from an administrative prompt:I tried with every answer below, but couldn\'t make it.Did this and workedAfter that I just installed virtualenv with pipI builded the virtualenv that I was working on and\nthe package was installed easily.\nGet into the virtualenv by using source /bin/activate \nand try to install your package, for example:It worked for me, although I was using python2.7 not python3Simply running easy_install -U pip resolved my problem.Check if have a python interpreter alive in any of the terminal windows.
