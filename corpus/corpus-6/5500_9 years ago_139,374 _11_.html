In Python for the *nix, does time.sleep() block the thread or the process?It blocks the thread.  If you look in Modules/timemodule.c in the Python source, you\'ll see that in the call to floatsleep(), the substantive part of the sleep operation is wrapped in a Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS and Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS block, allowing other threads to continue to execute while the current one sleeps.  You can also test this with a simple python program:Which will print:It will just sleep the thread except in the case where your application has only a single thread, in which case it will sleep the thread and effectively the process as well.The python documentation on sleep doesn\'t specify this however, so I can certainly understand the confusion!http://docs.python.org/2/library/time.htmlJust the thread.The thread will block, but the process is still alive.In a single threaded application, this means everything is blocked while you sleep.  In a multithreaded application, only the thread you explicitly \'sleep\' will block and the other threads still run within the process.Only the thread unless your process has a single thread.Process is not runnable by itself. In regard to execution, process is just a container for threads. Meaning you can\'t pause the process at all. It is simply not applicable to process.
