I want to rename a database, but keep getting the error that \'couldn\'t get exclusive lock\' on the database, which implies there is some connection(s) still active.How can I kill all the connections to the database so that I can rename it?See Kill All Active Connections To A Database.The reason that the approach that Adam suggested won\'t work is that during the time that you are looping over the active connections new one can be established, and you\'ll miss those. The article I linked to uses the following approach which does not have this drawback:Script to accomplish this, replace \'DB_NAME\' with the database to kill all connections to:Kill it, and kill it with fire:Using SQL Management Studio Express:In the Object Explorer tree drill down under Management to "Activity Monitor" (if you cannot find it there then right click on the database server and select "Activity Monitor"). Opening the Activity Monitor, you can view all process info. You should be able to find the locks for the database you\'re interested in and kill those locks, which will also kill the connection.You should be able to rename after that. I\'ve always used:Take offline takes a while and sometimes I experience some problems with that..Most solid way in my opinion:Detach\nRight click DB -> Tasks -> Detach...\ncheck "Drop Connections" \nOkReattach\nRight click Databases -> Attach..\nAdd... -> select your database, and change the Attach As column to your desired database name.\nOkuse the \'master\' database and run this query, it will kill all the active connections from your database.I usually run into that error when I am trying to restore a database I usually just go to the top of the tree in Management Studio and right click and restart the database server (because it\'s on a development machine, this might not be ideal in production).  This is close all database connections.In MS SQL Server Management Studio on the object explorer, right click on the database. In the context menu that follows select \'Tasks -> Take Offline\'Another "kill it with fire" approach is to just restart the MSSQLSERVER service.\nI like to do stuff from the commandline. Pasting this exactly into CMD will do it:\nNET STOP MSSQLSERVER & NET START MSSQLSERVEROr open "services.msc" and find "SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)" and right-click, select "restart".This will "for sure, for sure" kill ALL connections to ALL databases running on that instance.(I like this better than many approaches that change and change back the configuration on the server/database)Here\'s how to reliably this sort of thing in MS SQL Server Management Studio 2008 (may work for other versions too):The option working for me in this scenario is as follows: Try this:Right click on the database name, click on Property to get property window, Open the Options tab and change the "Restrict Access" property from Multi User to Single User. When you hit on OK button, it will prompt you to closes all open connection, select "Yes" and you are set to rename the database....These didn\'t work for me (SQL2008 Enterprise), I also couldn\'t see any running processes or users connected to the DB.  Restarting the server (Right click on Sql Server in Management Studio and pick Restart) allowed me to restore the DB.I\'m using SQL Server 2008 R2, my DB was already set for single user and there was a connection that restricted any action on the database. Thus the recommended SQLMenace\'s solution responded with error. Here is one that worked in my case.I use sp_who to get list of all process in database. This is better because you may want to review which process to kill.Result\nYou can use command in KillCommand column to kill the process you want to.You can Use SP_Who command and kill all process that use your database and then rename your database.
