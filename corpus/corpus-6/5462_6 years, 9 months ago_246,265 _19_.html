In my project I have an EditText. I want to count the characters in the EditText, and show that number it in a TextView. I have written the following code and it works fine. However, my problem is when I click Backspace it counts up, but I need to decrement the number. How can I consider Backspace?UseThe following was once suggested in one of the answers, but its very inefficienthow about just getting the length of char in your EditText and display it?something along the line oflittle few change in your code :This is a slightly more general answer with more explanation for future viewers.If you want to find the text length or do something else after the text has been changed, you can add a text changed listener to your edit text.The listener needs a TextWatcher, which requires three methods to be overridden: beforeTextChanged, onTextChanged, and afterTextChanged.You can get the character count in onTextChanged or beforeTextChanged with   or in afterTextChanged withThe parameters are a little confusing so here is a little extra explanation.beforeTextChangedbeforeTextChanged(CharSequence charSequence, int start, int count, int after)onTextChangedonTextChanged(CharSequence charSequence, int start, int before, int count)afterTextChangedafterTextChanged(Editable editable)Like onTextChanged, this is called after the change has already been made. However, now the text may be modified.
