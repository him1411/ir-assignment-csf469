I have a vector of numbers:How can I have R count the number of times a value x appears in the vector?You can just use table():Then you can subset it:Or convert it into a data.frame if you\'re more comfortable working with that:The most direct way is sum(numbers == x).  numbers == x creates a logical vector which is TRUE at every location that x occurs, and when suming, the logical vector is coerced to numeric which converts TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0.However, note that for floating point numbers it\'s better to use something like: sum(abs(numbers - x) < 1e-6).I would probably do something like thisBut really, a better way isMy preferred solution uses rle, which will return a value (the label, x in your example) and a length, which represents how many times that value appeared in sequence.By combining rle with sort, you have an extremely fast way to count the number of times any value appeared. This can be helpful with more complex problems.Example:If the value you want doesn\'t show up, or you need to store that value for later, make a a data.frame.I find it is rare that I want to know the frequency of one value and not all of the values, and rle seems to be the quickest way to get count and store them all.There is also count(numbers) from plyr package. Much more convenient than table in my opinion.There is a standard function in R for thattabulate(numbers)here\'s one fast and dirty way:If you want to count the number of appearances subsequently, you can make use of the sapply function:Output:You can change the number to whatever you wish in following line One more way i find convenient is:This converts the dataset to factor, and then summary() gives us the control totals (counts of the unique values).Output is:This can be stored as dataframe if preferred.as.data.frame(cbind(Number = names(s),Freq = s), stringsAsFactors=F, row.names = 1:length(s))here row.names has been used to rename row names.\nwithout using row.names, column names in s are used as row names in new dataframeOutput is:Using table but without comparing with names:table is useful when you are using the counts of different elements several times. If you need only one count, use sum(numbers == x)
