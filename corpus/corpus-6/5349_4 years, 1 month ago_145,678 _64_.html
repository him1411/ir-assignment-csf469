I just upgraded my iPhone 5 iOS 7 to four beta version. Now when I run my app from Xcode 5 on this iPhone, status bar doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hide, even though it should.Not Working:Not Working:Can\'t login to Apple Developer Forumsin your apps plist file add a row call it "View controller-based status bar appearance" and set it to NONote that this simply does not work, if you are using UIImagePickerController in the app.from http://www.openfl.org/developer/forums/general-discussion/iphone-5ios-7-cant-hide-status-bar/, mgiroux\'s solutionAdd method in your view controller.In the Plist add the following properties.-> Status bar is initially hidden = YES-> View controller-based status bar appearance = NOAdd both - now the status bar will disappear.To hide Status Bar on a Single view, you should use:         [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES withAnimation:UIStatusBarAnimationSlide];At first, this didn\'t work for me, and then a saw in the documentation of this method that says: \n// Setting statusBarHidden does nothing if your application is using the default UIViewController-based status bar system.This has to be done on the plist file, adding the key View controller-based status bar appearance set to NO.\nAnd then it worked.To hide status bar in iOS7 you need 2 lines of code inapplication:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions writein info.plist add thisIn order to use the legacy UIApplication method to hide/show the status bar, your app must set a plist value for iOS 7:View-Controller Based Status Bar Appearance = NOThis value is set to YES by default. If you change it to NO, you can use the legacy methods. If you leave it set to YES, you can still hide the status bar, but it\'s up to each view controller subclass in your app to override: prefersStatusBarHidden to return YES.Any time your app needs the status bar appearance or visibility to change, and View-Controller Based Status Bar Appearance is set to YES, your outermost view controller needs to call:setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdateAnimationThere are so many combinations suggested for this issue, but the problem is that iOS 6 and 7 use different methods to hide the status bar. I have never been successful setting the plist settings to enable the iOS6-style behaviour on iOS 7, but if you are building your app to support iOS 6+, you need to use 3 methods at once to ensure a particular view controller hides the status bar:This should work regardless of your plist settings.I had to do both changes below to hide the status bar:Add this code to the view controller where you want to hide the status bar:Add this to your .plist file (go to \'info\' in your application settings)Then you can call this line to hide the status bar:Just add these 2 lines in info.plist file. It will make the fix for iOS7 and older version both.Navigate to the project and select Targets -> General and see the "Status Bar style ...Hide during application launch" check box will be checked. This will work.Try this simple method:The only thing that worked for me is to add the following in your plistThe easiest method I\'ve found for hiding the status bar throughout the entire app is by creating a category on UIViewController and overriding prefersStatusBarHidden.

I thought it could be to do with the fact I had updated my Xcode and then the app to iOS 7 and some settings had got messed up somewhere. I decided To build a completely new project for it and after simple just setting: "Status bar is initially hidden = YES" and "View controller-based status bar appearance = NO" as stated by many others it worked correctly (i.e. no status bar).So my advice if you are working on a project which has been updated to iOS 7 from an old version and have tried all other options is to build a new project.You can check this code, pod UIViewController+ODStatusBarFor Swift 2.0+ IOS 9To hide status bar for specific viewControllerFor setting status bar Hidden for application:set View controller-based status bar appearancetoNO in .plist\nand in  application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: set:\n[application setStatusBarHidden:YES];Note: setStatusBarHidden: deprecatedORin Project settings -> General Tab ->Deployment InfoCheck Hide Status bar box.I\'m not sure why you "can\'t login to the Apple Developer Forums", but (without violating the NDA) you can also hide your statusBar through Xcode. It\'s a general setting on your application target.
