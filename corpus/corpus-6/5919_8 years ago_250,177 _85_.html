What is the most elegant code to validate that a string is a valid email address?What about this?To clarify, the question is asking whether a particular string is a valid representation of an e-mail address, not whether an e-mail address is a valid destination to send a message. For that, the only real way is to send a message to confirm.Note that e-mail addresses are more forgiving than you might first assume. These are all perfectly valid forms:For most use cases, a false "invalid" is much worse for your users and future proofing than a false "valid". Here\'s an article that used to be the accepted answer to this question (that answer has since been deleted). It has a lot more detail and some other ideas of how to solve the problem.Providing sanity checks is still a good idea for user experience. Assuming the e-mail passes validation, you can then pass it through another validator that could look for a known top-level domain, check the domain for an MX record, check for spelling errors from common domain names (gmail.cmo), etc. Then present a warning giving the user a chance to say "yes, my mail server really does allow \xf0\x9f\x8c\xae\xf0\x9f\x8d\xb3\xf0\x9f\x8e\x81 as an email address."As for using exception handling for business logic, I agree that is a thing to be avoided. But this is one of those cases where the convenience and clarity may outweigh the dogma.Per Stuart\'s comment, this compares the final address with the original string instead of always returning true. MailAddress tries to parse a string with spaces into "Display Name" and "Address" portions, so the original version was returning false positives.This is an old question, but all the answers I\'ve found on SO, including more recent ones, are answered similarly to this one.  However, in .Net 4.5 / MVC 4 you can add email address validation to a form by adding the [EmailAddress] annotation from System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations, so I was wondering why I couldn\'t just use the built-in functionality from .Net in general.  This seems to work, and seems to me to be fairly elegant:Personally, I would say that you should just make sure there is an @ symbol in there, with possibly a . character.  There\'s many regexes you could use of varying correctness, but I think most of these leave out valid email addresses, or let invalid ones through.  If people want to put in a fake email address, they will put in a fake one.  If you need to verify that the email address is legit, and that the person is in control of that email address, then you will need to send them an email with a special coded link so they can verify that it indeed is a real address.I took Phil\'s answer from #1 and created this class.\nCall it like this: bool isValid = Validator.EmailIsValid(emailString);Here is the class:.net 4.5 added  System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.EmailAddressAttributeYou can browse the EmailAddressAttribute\'s source, this is the Regex it uses internally:I use this single liner method which does the work for me-I think the best way is as follow:You can have this static function in a general class.I find this regex to be a good trade off between checking for something more than just the @ mark, and accepting weird edge cases:It will at least make you put something around the @ mark, and put at least a normal looking domain.Email address validation is not as easy as it might seem. It\'s actually theoretically impossible to fully validate an email address using just a regular expression.Check out my blog post about it for a discussion on the subject and a F# implementation using FParsec. [/shameless_plug]To be honest, in production code, the best I do is check for an @ symbol.I\'m never in a place to be completely validating emails. You know how I see if it was really valid? If it got sent. If it didn\'t, it\'s bad, if it did, life\'s good. That\'s all I need to know.The most elegant way is to use .Net\'s built in methods.These methods:Are tried and tested. These methods are used in my own professional projects.Use regular expressions internally, which are reliable and fast. Made by Microsoft for C#. There\'s no need to reinvent the wheel.Return a bool result. True means the email is valid.For users of .Net 4.5 and greaterAdd this Reference to your project:System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotationsNow you can use the following code:Example of useHere are some methods to declare:...and code demonstrating them in action:In addition, this example:Alternative, for users of a version of .Net less than 4.5For situations where .Net 4.5 is not available, I use the following solution:Specifically, I use:If you really and I mean really want to know if an email address is valid...ask the mail exchanger to prove it, no regex needed. I can provide the code if requested.General steps are as follows:\n1. does email address have a domain name part? (index of @ > 0)\n2. using a DNS query ask if domain has a mail exchanger\n3. open tcp connection to mail exchanger\n4. using the smtp protocol, open a message to the server using the email address as the reciever\n5. parse the server\'s response.\n6. quit the message if you made it this far, everything is good.This is as you can imagine, very expensive time wise and relies on smtp, but it does work.Here\'s my answer -- Phil\'s solution fails for single letter domains like "someone@q.com".  Believe it or not, that\'s used =) (goes to centurylink, for instance).Phil\'s answer is also going to work only with PCRE standard... so C# will take it, but javascript is going to bomb.  It\'s too complex for javascript.  So you can\'t use Phil\'s solution for mvc validation attributes.Here\'s my regex.  It\'ll work nicely with MVC validation attributes.\n- Everything before the @ is simplified, so that at least javascript will work. I\'m okay relaxing validation here as long as exchange server doesn\'t give me a 5.1.3.\n- Everything after the @ is Phil\'s solution modified for single letter domains.For people suggesting using system.net.mail MailMessage(), that thing is WAY to flexible.  Sure, C# will accept the email, but then exchange server will bomb with 5.1.3 runtime error as soon as you try to send the email.Generally speaking, a regular expression to validate email addresses is not an easy thing to come up with; at the time of this writing, the syntax of an email address must follow a relatively high number of standards and implementing all of them within a regular expression is practically unfeasible!I highly suggest you to try our EmailVerify.NET, a mature .NET library which can validate email addresses following all of the current IETF standards (RFC 1123, RFC 2821, RFC 2822, RFC 3696, RFC 4291, RFC 5321 and RFC 5322), tests the related DNS records, checks if the target mailboxes can accept messages and can even tell if a given address is disposable or not.Disclaimer: I am the lead developer for this component.Check email string is right format or wrong format by System.Text.RegularExpressions:/Using the Internal Regex used in creating the "new EmailAddressAttribute();" component in .Net4.5 >>> using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; \n        //To Validate an Email Address......Tested and Working.Also, You can use this:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/01escwtf(v=vs.110).aspxThere is culture problem in regex in C# rather then js. So we need to use regex in US mode for email check. If you don\'t use ECMAScript mode, your language special characters are imply in A-Z with regex.Here is an answer to your question for you to check.I succinctified Poyson 1\'s answer like so:I wrote an function to check if an email is valid or not. It seems working well for me in most cases.Results:Code:Simple way to identify the emailid is valid or not.I ended up using this regex, as it successfully validates commas, comments, Unicode characters and IP(v4) domain addresses. Valid addresses will be:" "@example.org(comment)test@example.org\xd1\x82\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82@example.org\xe1\x83\xa2\xe1\x83\x94\xe1\x83\xa1\xe1\x83\xa2\xe1\x83\x98@example.orgtest@[192.168.1.1]Until this process completes successfully, the email is assumed to be invalid.Some time back, I wrote an EmailAddressValidationAttribute that should properly validate pretty much any relatively normal email address of the formIt\'s a System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ValidationAttribute, so usage is really simple.And, since digging through all the RFCs and errata and assembling all the bits required to properly enumerate all the rules is...tedious — at best! — I posted the source code for the validator in my answer to the question C# Email Address validation for the source code.My validator isn\'t perfect by any stretch of the imagination, though Just for starters, it doesn\'t have any built-in support for emitting client-side javascript validation, though it wouldn\'t be too difficult to add that in. From my answer above:Here\'s the validation attribute I wrote. It validates pretty much every "raw" email\n  address, that is those of the form local-part@domain. It doesn\'t support any of\n  the other, more...creative constructs that the RFCs allow (this list is not\n  comprehensive by any means):It should accept almost any email address that can be expressed thuslywithout requiring the use of quotes ("), angle brackets (\'<>\')\n  or square brackets ([]).No attempt is made to validate that the rightmost dns label in the domain is a valid\n  TLD (top-level domain). That is because the list of TLDs is far larger now than the\n  "big 6" (.com, .edu, .gov, .mil, .net, .org) plus 2-letter ISO country codes.\n  ICANN actually updates the TLD list daily, though I suspect that the list\n  doesn\'t actually change daily. Further, [ICANN just approved a big expansion of the\n  generic TLD namespace][2]). And some email addresses don\'t have what you\'d recognize\n  as a TLD (did you know that postmaster@. is theoretically valid and mailable? Mail\n  to that address should get delivered to the postmaster of the DNS root zone.)Extending the regular expression to support domain literals shouldn\'t be too difficult.I created an email address validation routine based on Wikipedia\'s documented rules and sample addresses. For those that don\'t mind looking at a little more code, here you go. Honestly, I had no idea how many crazy rules there were in the email address specification. I don\'t fully validate the hostname or ipaddress, but it still passes all of the test cases on wikipedia.This may be the best way for the email validation for your textbox.Just include in any function where you want.A simple one without using Regex (which I don\'t like for its poor readability):Examples:It is meant to be simple and therefore it doesn\'t deal with rare cases like emails with bracketed domains that contain spaces (typically allowed), emails with IPv6 addresses, etc.
