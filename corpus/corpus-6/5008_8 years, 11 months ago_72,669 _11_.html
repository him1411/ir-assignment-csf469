I\'d like to log the call trace during certain points, like failed assertions, or uncaught exceptions.This code works on any thread.n13\'s answer didnt quite work - i modified it slightly to come up with thisCocoa already logs the stack trace on uncaught exceptions to the console although they\'re just raw memory addresses. If you want symbolic information in the console there\'s some sample code from Apple.If you want to generate a stack trace at an arbitrary point in your code (and you\'re on Leopard), see the backtrace man page. Before Leopard, you actually had to dig through the call stack itself.This pretty much tells you what to do.Essentially you need to set up the applications exception handling to log, something like: I found this to be exactly what I needed: Puts a catch in the main.m class and prints the stack trace. I am not sure it works in all situations, e.g. not sure this will work when there\'s a C level crash. But, better than nothing, and easy to install.http://blog.evergizmo.com/2012/01/17/objective-c-tip-how-to-print-stack-trace/In case the link goes away - put this in main.m:    For exceptions, you can use the NSStackTraceKey member of the exception\'s userInfo dictionary to do this. See Controlling a Program\'s Response to Exceptions on Apple\'s website.
