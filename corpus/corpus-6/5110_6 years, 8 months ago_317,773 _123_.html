I\'m able to access my laptop web server using the Android emulator, I\'m using 10.0.2.2:portno\nworks well.But when I connect my real Android phone, the phone browser can\'t connect to the same web server on my laptop. The phone is connected to the laptop using a USB cable. If I run the \nadb devices command, I can see my phone.What am I missing?USB doesn\'t provide network to mobile device. If both your desktop and phone are connected to the same WiFi (or any other local network), then use your desktop IP address assigned by the router (not localhost and not 127.0.0.1). To find out the IP address of your desktop: If your phone is connected to the mobile network, then things are going to be harder. Either go hardcore:Otherwise use something like xip.io or ngrok.It is very simple.Turn on Wifi Hotspot of your Android phone/router and connect your Laptop to your phone.Start your server at localhost (I am using wamp server)Now open command prompt and enter ipconfig command you will get following thingsCopy this 192.168.43.76  in your mobile browser.Note : Please set your network as "Home Network". Setting Home Network means allowing your PC to share stuff with other devices on the same network.\n If your using Windows 10 go to WiFi > Network properties of current network > Make this PC Discoverable.On Windows PC You may not need to do anything else than finding out your IPv4 Address using "ipconfig" command.Other Env Details : \nWindows 7, Google Nexus 4 (4.2.2), Tomcat Server, Grails Application.You should also make sure that you have the permission to access internet in AndroidManifest file :I found a quick solution to this problem. Try this link. It should help you fix the problem.I only changed one thing, where the tutorial states you change \'127.0.0.1\' to \'All\', change it to the IP address your server is running on instead.After that, you should be able to connect to your localhost.Below is a (proofread) copy of the information from the linked page:Install the Wamp server (or any other you prefer).This is one of the best servers I know to set up a local server. If you have installed Apache or any other server, ignore this step.Download and install Wamp Server from here.Add a new rule for port 80 in Windows Firewall.Open the Control Panel and select Windows Firewall.Select Advanced settings from the left panel of the Windows Firewall setting page.Select Inbound Rules from the left panel, then select New Rule.Select Port and click Next.Select the \xe2\x80\x9cSpecific local ports\xe2\x80\x9d radio button and enter 80 as the port value.Keep Allow the connection unchanged and move to the next step.Keep Profile options unchanged and click Next.Give some nice name to your new rule and click Finish.This will enable port 80 access on local network IP.Edit the httpd.conf file of the Wamp server to fix the 403 error.We need to edit this file. Otherwise, we will get the 403 forbidden error when we access the localhost through a local network IP.Click on the Wamp server tray icon.Open Apache server sub menu.Select httpd.conf.Find this section of configuration in the httpd.conf file:Find and replace \xe2\x80\x98127.0.0.1\xe2\x80\x99 with \xe2\x80\x98All\xe2\x80\x99, save the file, and restart your Wamp server.Find your local network IP.Open the command prompt.Type and enter the ipconfig command.In my case, my local area network address is 10.0.0.2.This is the IP which you need to access your localhost on your Android phone over wifi. To test if it is working, type this IP address in your desktop browser where your localhost server is installed. The browser should display your localhost page successfully. This will assure that this local network IP is now successfully accessible on your Android phone.I hope this tutorial will help you to access your localhost over wifi.i had success by enabling remote management:You will see a message similar to this    Other users can manage your computer using the address some.url.comOn your android device you should now be able to hit some.url.com, which delegates to localhost on your mac. You can also use ifconfig to get the ip of your macbookIf you don\'t mind exposing your project with a temporary domain you can use ngrok. Lets say I have an app that runs on localhost:9460This will give me:I can now reach https://f7c23d14.ngrok.io as a way to remotely view localhost. This is great to share design work or progress with clientsIf you are running something like this through nginx proxy_pass it will require a bit more tweaking - this is a hacky approach, but it works for me and i am open to suggestions on improving it:```reload and visit http://youripaddress:81As this is an old question, there is a new way to do this that is really really simple. Download the ADB Chrome Extension and then follow these instructions:https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debuggingThere is however a far better solution. You can access your host machine with the IP address "10.0.2.2". This has been designed in this way by the Android team. So your webserver can perfectly run at localhost and from your Android app you can access it via "http://10.0.2.2:8080".You may have your web server listening on your loopback interface and not on your network interface. Major signs of this are:I talk more about diagnosing this and fixing this in an answer here.Run CMD as administrator and on CMD screen type ipconfig and the screen will appear with text as this photo \nand you can access your localhost using this ip \nyou have to be connected to same network as your pc connected to "Port forwarding on Chrome for Android makes it easy to test your development site on mobile. It works by creating a listening TCP port on your mobile device that maps to a particular TCP port on your development machine. Traffic between these ports travels through USB, so the connection doesn\'t depend on your network configuration."More details here: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#port-forwardingTry going to this file: \nC:\\wamp\\bin\\apache\\Apache2.2.11\\conf\\httpd.confAnd change 10.0.2.2 to your IP address.I used this process:Note that this process requires you to change the WiFi settings on the Android device at the start and end of every session. I found this less painful then rooting my Android device.First of all make your machine(where server is running)IP address static. Enter this static IP address in the android code. \nNext go to your wifi router\'s interface and check the left panel. You will see option such as port forwarding/forwarding. Click on it and forward port 80.\nNow edit your htttpd.conf file and edit it for Allow from All. Restart your server. Everything should work fine now. Additionally you can reserve the IP address of your machine so that it is always allocated to you.\nIn the left panel of your router\'s interface, find DHCP -> Address Reservation, click on it. Enter your machine\'s MAC address and the IP address you have entered in the code. Click on save. This will reserve the given IP address for your machine.  A solution to connect my mobile device to my wamp server based on my laptop:First, wifi is not a router. So to connect my mobile device to my wamp server based on localhost on my laptop, I need a router. \nI have downloaded and installed a free virtual router: https://virtualrouter.codeplex.com/ Configuring it is really simple:Then you can connect to your laptop via your device by launching a browser and fill the IPV4 address of your laptop \n(to find it on windows, type in cmd : ipconfig,  and find ipv4 address)You should see your wamp server home page. Was running into this problem using several different localhost servers. Finally got my app up and running on the phone in seconds just by using the Python simple server. It only takes a few seconds so is worth a try before getting into any more complicated solutions. First, make sure you have Python installed. cmd+r and type python for Windows  or $ python --version in mac terminal.  Next:Then just find the address of your host machine on the network, I used System Preferences/Sharing on mac to find it. Tap that into your Android device and should load your index.html and you should be good. If not then the problem is something else and you may want to look into some of the other suggested solutions. Good luck!* EDIT *Another quick solution to try if you\'re using Chrome is the Web Server for Chrome extension. I found it a quick and super easy way to get access to localhost on my phone. Just make sure to check Accessible to local network under the Options and it should work on your cell without any problem.ngrok lets you put your localhost onto a temporary server and is very simple to set up. I\'ve provided some steps here that can be found in the link:You\'ll see a little dashboard in your terminal with an address pointing to your localhost. Point your app to that address and build to your device.Although one answer has been accepted but this worked for me:Open your mobile settings and go to network-> long press your wifi network-> modify network -> scroll down to advanced options -> chose proxy manual and in proxy hostname type your address i.e. 19*.16*.1.4 inside port enter your port. and save it.search for what is my ip in google chrome, and get your ip, lets say it is 1**.1**.15*.2**It is as simple as this.This is what worked for me, I added another line after the 127.0.0.1 ip to specify the exact local network ip address (not the public ip address) of the device I wanted to use. In my case my Samsung Galaxy S3As suggested by Bangptit edit the httpd.conf file (x being the version numbers):\nC:\\wamp\\bin\\apache\\Apache2.x.x\\conf\\httpd.confSearch for the onlineoffline tag and add the ip of your phone (I found my phones ip address in my routers configuration pages):One could extend this to include an entire sub domain too for e.g. 192.168.1.0/24 etcFirst of all connect your phone and computer to common wifi.Then,  open command prompt using run as administratorGive ipconfig commandWhich shows wireless lan ipUse ip:port of your server to access in phone(for example, if you use WAMP server):1) Install your Android drivers on your PC and download portable Android Tethering Reverse Tool and connect your Android device through the Reverse Tool application.2) Click on WAMP icon > Put Online (after restarting).3) Open your IP in the Android browser (i.e. http://192.168.1.22 OR http://164.92.124.42 )To find your local IP address, click Start>Run>cmd and type ipconfig and your IP address will show up in the output.That\'s all.  Now you can access (open) localhost from Android.use connectify and xampp or equivalent, and type ip address on mobile URL bar to accessPersonally I do not insist to use localhost when using device, there is no easy solution.Just start the activity where you connect to localhost where you can use emulator. Whatever info you have to get from device can be generated with ease and can be sent to activity as parameter.What worked for me ( target: debug an windows server app running on localhost:99999 from an client app running on android phone )then the service app url (my_dev_machine_ip:99999/path_to_service) was accessible from the phone.Adding a solution for future developers.Copy address of your ip address. right click on your network -> network and sharing-> click on the connection you currently have-> details-> then the address beside ipv4 address is your ip address, note this down somewhereGo to control panel -> system and security -> windows firewall -> advanced settings -> inbound rules -> new rules (follow the steps to add a port e.g 80, its really simple to follow)put your ip address that you noted down  on your phone browser and the port number you created the rule for beside it. e.g 192.168.0.2:80 and wala. Possible solution if it doesn\'t connect.\nright click network->open network and sharing-> look under view your active connections, under the name of your connection  at the type of connection and click on it if it is public,  and make sure to change it to a home network. its very simple , - GOTO command line (Window + R [type cmd]) - type ipconfig , that will show the current IP address of your PC - write taht IP address on your Android Phone\'s browser with :80 e.g (http://192.168.x.x:80)Donelocalhost will appear on your Phone
