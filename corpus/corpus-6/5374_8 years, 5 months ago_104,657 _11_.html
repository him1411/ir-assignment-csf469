What is the general guidance on when you should use CAST versus CONVERT? Is there any performance issues related to choosing one versus the other? Is one closer to ANSI-SQL?CONVERT is SQL Server specific, CAST is ANSI.CONVERT is more flexible in that you can format dates etc. Other than that, they are pretty much the same. If you don\'t care about the extended features, use CAST.EDIT:As noted by @beruic and @C-F in the comments below, there is possible loss of precision when an implicit conversion is used (that is one where you use neither CAST nor CONVERT). For further information, see CAST and CONVERT and in particular this graphic: SQL Server Data Type Conversion Chart. With this extra information, the original advice still remains the same. Use CAST where possible.Convert has a style parameter for date to string conversions.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187928.aspxCAST is standar SQL, but CONVERT is not (only for the dialect T-SQL), we have a small advantage for convert in the case datetimewith CAST, you indicate the\nexpression and the target type; with CONVERT, there\xe2\x80\x99s a third argument representing the\nstyle for the conversion, which is supported for some conversions, like between character\nstrings and date and time values. For example, CONVERT(DATE, \'1/2/2012\', 101) converts the\nliteral character string to DATE using style 101 representing the United States standard.regards,CAST uses ANSI standard. In case of portability, this will work on other platforms.  CONVERT is specific to sql server. But is very strong function. You can specify different styles for dates
