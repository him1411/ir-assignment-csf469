What\'s a simple and canonical way to read an entire file into memory in Scala?  (Ideally, with control over character encoding.)The best I can come up with is:or am I supposed to use one of Java\'s god-awful idioms, the best of which (without using an external library) seems to be:From reading mailing list discussions, it\'s not clear to me that scala.io.Source is even supposed to be the canonical I/O library.  I don\'t understand what its intended purpose is, exactly.... I\'d like something dead-simple and easy to remember.  For example, in these languages it\'s very hard to forget the idiom ...By the way, "scala." isn\'t really necessary, as it\'s always in scope anyway, and you can, of course, import io\'s contents, fully or partially, and avoid having to prepend "io." too.The above leaves the file open, however. To avoid problems, you should close it like this:Another problem with the code above is that it is horrible slow due to its implementation nature. For larger files one should use:Just to expand on Daniel\'s solution, you can shorten things up tremendously by inserting the following import into any file which requires file manipulation:With this, you can now do:I would be wary of reading an entire file into a single String.  It\'s a very bad habit, one which will bite you sooner and harder than you think.  The getLines method returns a value of type Iterator[String].  It\'s effectively a lazy cursor into the file, allowing you to examine just the data you need without risking memory glut.Oh, and to answer your implied question about Source: yes, it is the canonical I/O library.  Most code ends up using java.io due to its lower-level interface and better compatibility with existing frameworks, but any code which has a choice should be using Source, particularly for simple file manipulation.(EDIT: This does not work in scala 2.9 and maybe not 2.8 either)Use trunk:I\'ve been told that Source.fromFile is problematic. Personally, I have had problems opening large files with Source.fromFile and have had to resort to Java InputStreams.Another interesting solution is using scalax. Here\'s an example\xc2\xa0of some well commented code that opens a log file using ManagedResource to open a file with scalax helpers: http://pastie.org/pastes/420714Using getLines() on scala.io.Source discards what characters were used for line terminators (\\n, \\r, \\r\\n, etc.)The following should preserve it character-for-character, and doesn\'t do excessive string concatenation (performance problems):Control over character encoding, and no resources to clean up. Also, optimized, since Files.readAllBytes allocates a byte array that matches the size of the file.Just like in Java, using CommonsIO library:Also, many answers here forget Charset. It\'s better to always provide it explicitly, or it will hit one day.as a few people mentioned scala.io.Source is best to be avoided due to connection leaks. Probably scalax and pure java libs like commons-io are the best options until the new incubator project (ie scala-io) gets merged.you can also use Path from scala io to read and process files.Now you can get file path using this:- You can also Include terminators but by default it is set to false..For faster overall reading / uploading a (large) file, consider increasing the size of bufferSize (Source.DefaultBufSize set to 2048), for instance as follows,Note Source.scala. For further discussion see Scala fast text file read and upload to memory.For emulating Ruby syntax (and convey the semantics) of opening and reading a file, consider this implicit class (Scala 2.10 and upper),In this way,One more: https://github.com/pathikrit/better-files#streams-and-codecsVarious ways to slurp a file without loading the contents into memory:You can supply your own codec too for anything that does a read/write (it assumes scala.io.Codec.default if you don\'t provide one):The obvious question being "why do you want to read in the entire file?" This is obviously not a scalable solution if your files get very large. The scala.io.Source gives you back an Iterator[String] from the getLines method, which is very useful and concise.It\'s not much of a job to come up with an implicit conversion using the underlying java IO utilities to convert a File, a Reader or an InputStream to a String. I think that the lack of scalability means that they are correct not to add this to the standard API.  print every line, like use Java BufferedReader read ervery line, and print it:equivalent:You do not need to parse every single line and then concatenate them again...I prefer to use this:in arguments you can give file path and it will return all lines
