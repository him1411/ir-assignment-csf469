Is there any easy way to remove all classes matching, for example, so if I have an element:after removing, it would beThanks!The removeClass function takes a function argument since jQuery 1.4.Live example: http://jsfiddle.net/xa9xS/1409/I\'ve written a plugin that does this called alterClass \xe2\x80\x93 Remove element classes with wildcard matching. Optionally add classes: https://gist.github.com/1517285 I\'ve generalized this into a Jquery plugin which takes a regex as an argument.Coffee:Javascript:So, for this case, usage would be (both Coffee and Javascript):Note that I\'m using the Array.filter function which doesn\'t exist in IE<9. You could use Underscore\'s filter function instead or Google for a polyfill like this WTFPL one.Similar to @tremby\'s answer, here is @Kobi\'s answer as a plugin that will match either prefixes or suffixes.https://gist.github.com/zaus/6734731Based on ARS81\'s answer (that only matches class names beginning with), here\'s a more flexible version. Also a hasClass() regex version.Usage: $(\'.selector\').removeClassRegex(\'\\\\S*-foo[0-9]+\')This will effectively remove all class names which begins with prefix from a node\'s class attribute. Other answers do not support SVG elements (as of writing this), but this solution does:If you want to use it in other places I suggest you an extension. This one is working fine for me.Usage:You could also use the className property of the element\'s DOM object:we can get all the classes by .attr("class"), and to Array, And loop & filter:demo: http://jsfiddle.net/L2A27/1/For a jQuery plugin try thisor thisI had the same issue and came up with the following that uses underscore\'s _.filter method. Once I discovered that removeClass takes a function and provides you with a list of classnames, it was easy to turn that into an array and filter out the classname to return back to the removeClass method.A regex splitting on word boundary \\b isn\'t the best solution for this:or as a jQuery mixin:if you have more than one element having a class name \'example\', to remove classes of \'color-\'in all of them you can do this:[using jquery]if you don\'t put [a-z1-9-]* in your regex it won\'t remove the classes which have a number or some \'-\' in their names.If you just need to remove the last set color, the following might suit you.In my situation, I needed to add a color class to the body tag on a click event and remove the last color that was set. In that case, you store the current color, and then look up the data tag to remove the last set color.Code:\nMight not be exactly what you need, but for me it was and this was the first SO question I looked at, so thought I would share my solution in case it helps anyone.
