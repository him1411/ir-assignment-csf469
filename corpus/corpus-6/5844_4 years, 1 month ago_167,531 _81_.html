I want to setup the Android dev environment from command line, and encounter the following issue:after extract the file, runHowever, it is too slow on runningThe result is that nothing in folder build-tools, and I want is aapt and apkbuilder, since I want to build apk from command line without ant.By default, the SDK Manager from the command line does not include the build tools in the list.  They\'re in the "obsolete" category.  To see all available downloads, use And then to get one of the packages in that list from the command line, use:Where -u stands for --no-ui, -a stands for --all and -t stands for --filter.If you need to install multiple packages do:Where 1,2,..,n is the package number listed with the list command aboveAs mentioned in other answers, you can use the --filter option to limit the installed packages:android update sdk --filter ...The other answers don\'t mention that you can use constant string identifiers instead of indexes (which will change) for the filter options. This is helpful for unattended or scripted installs. Man for --filter option:... This also accepts the identifiers returned by \'list sdk --extended\'.android list sdk --all --extended :Then you can use the string ids as the filter options to precisely specify the versions you want:android update sdk --filter tools,platform-tools,build-tools-19.0.3 etcADB Build-Tools Will Not be downloaded automatically, by command android update sdk --no-uiSo for installing Buil-Tool type (in console): Remember the number that is listed before the item and execute the following:commands should be typed in /YourFolder/android-sdk-linux/toolsAlso for remote folder (server opened by ssh for example) type:For simple list of ADB packages type in terminal:for install all packages:Or with filters (comma is separator):Version 25.2.3 (and higher) of Android SDK Tools package contains new tool - sdkmanager - which simplifies this task of installing build-tools from the command line.\nIt is located in android_sdk/tools/bin folder.  Usage (from documentation):The packages argument is an SDK-style path, wrapped in quotes (for\n  example, "build-tools;25.0.0" or "platforms;android-25"). You can\n  pass multiple package paths, separated with a space, but they must\n  each be wrapped in their own set of quotes.Example usage (on my Mac):You can also specify various options, for example to force all connections to use HTTP (--no_https), or in order to use proxy server (--proxy_host=address and --proxy_port=port).To check the available options, use the --help flag. On my machine (Mac), the output is as following:  A great source of information I came across while trying to install everything Android SDK related from the command line, was this Dockerfile. Inside the Dockerfile you can see that the author executes a single command to install platform tools and build tools without any other interaction. In the case the OP has put forth, the command would be adapted to:Most of the answers seem to ignore the fact that you may need to run the update in a headless environment with no super user rights, which means the script has to answer all the y/n license prompts automatically.Here\'s the example that does the trick.No matter how many prompts you get, all of those will be answered. This while/sleep loop looks like simulation of the yes command, and in fact it is, well almost. The problem with yes is that it floods stdout with \'y\' and there is virtually no delay between sending those characters and the version I had to deal with had no timeout option of any kind. It will "pollute" stdout and the script will fail complaining about incorrect input. The solution is to put a delay between sending \'y\' to stdout, and that\'s exactly what while/sleep combo does.expect is not available by default on some linux distros and I had no way to install it as part of my CI scripts, so had to use the most generic solution and nothing can be more generic than simple bash script, right?As a matter of fact, I blogged about it (NSBogan), check it out for more details here if you are interested.I just had a heck of a time getting android sdk dependencies installed via command line and since the documentation that comes with the tools and online are woefully lacking, I thought I\'d post what I discovered here.I\'m working with android sdk r24.4.1 for linux.  There are two commands that you can run to list the available packages:android list sdkand the more exhaustive:android list sdk --allThe package numbers for specific packages differ for each command above!  For example, the former lists package  API 23.1 revision 3 as package #3 and the latter lists it as #29.  Now, there are two different ways to install using the android command.  tools/android update sdk --no-ui --filter <package number>and tools/android update sdk -u -a -t <package number>Given that the install commands each can take the package # as a parameter, which package number do you use?  After much online searching and trial and error, I discovered thatandroid update sdk --no-ui --filter uses the package numbers from android list sdkand android update sdk -u -a -t uses the package numbers from android list sdk --allIn other words - to install API 23.1 revision 3 you can do either:android update sdk --no-ui --filter 3orandroid update sdk -u -a -t 29Crazy, but it works.However, it is too slow on runningYes, I\'ve had the same problem.  Some of the file downloads are extremely slow (or at least they have been in the last couple of days).  If you want to download everything there\'s not a lot you can do about that.The result is that nothing in folder build-tools, and I want is aapt and apkbuilder, since I want to build apk from command line without ant.Did you let it run to completion?One thing you can do is filter the packages that are being downloaded using the -t switch.For example:When I tried this the other day I got version 18.0.0 of the build tools installed.  For some reason the latest version 18.0.1 is not included by this filter and the only way to get it was to install everything with the --all switch.I just had this problem, so I finally wrote a 1 line bash dirty solution by reading and parsing the list of aviable tools :Inspired from answers by @i4niac & @Aur\xc3\xa9lien Lambert, this is what i came up withExplanationI prefer to put a script that install my dependencies Something like:https://github.com/caipivara/android-scripts/blob/master/install-android-dependencies.shBuild tools could not be downloaded automatically by default as Nate said in https://stackoverflow.com/a/19416222/1104031 post.But I wrote small tool that make everything for youI used "expect" tool as danb in https://stackoverflow.com/a/17863931/1104031 post.\nYou only need android-sdk and python27, expect.This script will install all build tools, all sdks and everything you need for automated build:As stated in other responses, the build tools requires the --all flag to be installed. You also better use a -t filter flag to avoid installing ALL\xc2\xa0the packages but there is no way to filter all the build tools.There are already features requests for these two points in AOSP bug tracker. Feel free to vote for them, this might make them happen some day:I tried this for update all, and it worked!Try1. List all packages2. Install packages using following commandandroid update sdkThis command will update and install all latest release for SDK Tools, Build Tools,SDK platform tools.It\'s Work for me.
