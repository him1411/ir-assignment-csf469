As Java 8 allows for default implementation of methods in interface called Default Methods, there seems to be a confusion between when would I use a abstract class.So when should interface with default methods be used and when should an abstract class be used? Are the abstract classes still useful in that scenario?   There\'s a lot more to abstract classes than default method implementations (such as private state), but as of Java 8, whenever you have the choice of either, you should go with the defender (aka. default) method in the interface.The constraint on the default method is that it can be implemented only in the terms of calls to other interface methods, with no reference to a particular implementation\'s state. So the main use case is higher-level and convenience methods.The good thing about this new feature is that, where before you were forced to use an abstract class for the convenience methods, thus constraining the implementor to single inheritance, now you can have a really clean design with just the interface and a minimum of implementation effort forced on the programmer.There are a few technical differences. Abstract classes can still do more in comparison to Java 8 interfaces:Conceptually, main purpose of defender methods is a backward compatibility after introduction of new features (as lambda-functions) in Java 8.This is being described in this article. Think about forEach of Collections.The forEach isn\xe2\x80\x99t declared by java.util.List nor the\n  java.util.Collection interface yet. One obvious solution would be to\n  just add the new method to the existing interface and provide the\n  implementation where required in the JDK. However, once published, it\n  is impossible to add methods to an interface without breaking the\n  existing implementation.The benefit that default methods bring is that now it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to\n  add a new default method to the interface and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t break the\n  implementations.These two are quite different:Default methods are to add external functionality to existing classes without changing their state.And abstract classes are a normal type of inheritance, they are normal classes which are intended to be extended.Whenever we have a choice between abstract class and interface we should always (almost) prefer default (also known as defender or virtual extensions) methods.Another important use of default methods is interface evolution. Suppose I had a class Ball as:public class Ball implements Collection {   ...   }Now in Java 8 a new feature streams in introduced. We can get a stream by using stream method added to the interface. If stream were not a default method all the implementations for Collection interface would have broken as they would not be implementing this new method. Adding a non-default method to an interface is not source-compatible.But suppose we do not recompile the class and use an old jar file which contains this class Ball. The class will load fine without this missing method, instances can be created and it seems everything is working fine. BUT if program invokes stream method on instance of Ball we will get AbstractMethodError. So making method default solved both the problems.Regarding your query of So when should interface with default methods be used and when should an abstract class be used? Are the abstract classes still useful in that scenario?java documentation  provides perfect answer. Abstract Classes Compared to Interfaces:Abstract classes are similar to interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private concrete methods.With interfaces, all fields are automatically public, static, and final, and all methods that you declare or define (as default methods) are public. In addition, you can extend only one class, whether or not it is abstract, whereas you can implement any number of interfaces.Use cases for each of them have been explained in below SE post:What is the difference between an interface and abstract class?Are the abstract classes still useful in that scenario?Yes. They are still useful. They can contain non-static, non-final methods   and attributes (protected, private in addition to public), which is not possible even with Java-8 interfaces. As described in thisarticle,Abstract classes versus interfaces in Java 8After introducing Default Method, it seems that interfaces and\n  abstract classes are same. However, they are still different concept\n  in Java 8.Abstract class can define constructor. They are more structured and\n  can have a state associated with them. While in contrast, default\n  method can be implemented only in the terms of invoking other\n  interface methods, with no reference to a particular implementation\'s\n  state. Hence, both use for different purposes and choosing between two\n  really depends on the scenario context.Default methods in Java interface enables interface evolution.Given an existing interface, if you wish to add a method to it without breaking the binary compatibility with older versions of the interface, you have two options at hands: add a default or a static method. Indeed, any abstract method added to the interface would have to be impleted by the classes or interfaces implementing this interface.A static method is unique to a class. A default method is unique to an instance of the class.If you add a default method to an existing interface, classes and interfaces which implement this interface do not need to implement it. They canMore on the topic here.Why we have to use abstract class:Why we have to use interface:Remi Forax rule is You don\'t design with Abstract classes. You design your app with interfaces. Watever is the version of Java, whatever is the language. It is backed by the Interface segregation principle in SOLID principles.You can later use Abstract classes to factorize code. Now with Java 8 you can do it directly in the interface. This is a facility, not more.when should interface with default methods be used and when should an\n  abstract class be used?Backward compatibility:\nImagine that your interface is implemented by hundreds of classes, modifying that interface will force all the users to implement the newly added method, even though it could be not essential for many other classes that implements your interface, Plus it allows your  interface to be a functional interfaceFacts & Restrictions: 1-May only be declared within an interface and not within a class or\nabstract class.2-Must provide a body3-It is not assumed to be abstract as other normal methods used in an interface.In Java 8 we can have concrete methods within interfaces.. right.. So how it is different from Abstract classes? Remember an abstract class is a class that can not be instantiated (i.e. objects can not be created of) and which may contain method bodies. Default method in Java 8 looks similar to Abstract class isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?We\xe2\x80\x99ll its different actually. Abstract class can hold state of object. It can have constructors and member variables. Whereas interfaces with Java 8 default methods cannot hold state. It cannot have constructors and member variables. You should still use Abstract class whenever you think your class can have state or you need to do something in constructor. Default method should be used for backward compatibility. Whenever you want to add additional functionality in an existing legacy interface you can use default methods without breaking any existing implementer classes
