I am trying to set up Bower on a build server at our organization\'s data center, but git\'s port does not appear to be open on the data center\'s firewall.  I can use the git command line client to clone via https://[repo], but not git://[repo].Is there a switch or preference which will instruct bower to perform git clone using https rather than the git protocol?I\'ve looked at the source, and considered changing the resolution code to replace git:// with https://, but I figured I\'d ask before I go to those lengths.You can make git replace the protocol for you. Just run:Building on the answer from @Sindre, I wrote a little helper function in BASH which lives in my ~/.bashrc file. Call it just as you would grunt, except now it\'s called nngrunt. Enjoy!
