I\'m working on an interactive interface using SVG and JavaScript/jQuery, and I\'m trying to decide between Raphael and jQuery SVG. I\'d like to know I don\'t need the VML/IE support in Raphael, or the plotting abilities of jQuery SVG. I\'m primarily interested in the most elegant way to create, animate, and manipulate individual items on an SVG canvas.I\'ve recently used both Raphael and jQuery SVG - and here are my thoughts:Pros: a good starter library, easy to do a LOT of things with SVG quickly. Well written and documented. Lots of examples and Demos. Very extensible architecture. Great with animation.Cons: is a layer over the actual SVG markup, makes it difficult to do more complex things with SVG - such as grouping (it supports Sets, but not groups). Doesn\'t do great w/ editing of already existing elements.Pros: a jquery plugin, if you\'re already using jQuery. Well written and documented. Lots of examples and demos. Supports most SVG elements, allows native access to elements easilyCons: architecture not as extensible as Raphael. Some things could be better documented (like configure of SVG element). Doesn\'t do great w/ editing of already existing elements. Relies on SVG semantics for animation - which is not that great.SnapSVG is the successor of Raphael. It is supported only in the SVG enabled browsers and supports almost all the features of SVG.If you\'re doing something quick and easy, Raphael is an easy choice. If you\'re going to do something more complex, I chose to use jQuery SVG because I can manipulate the actual markup significantly easier than with Raphael. And if you want a non-jQuery solution then SnapSVG is a good option.For posterity, I\'d like to note that I ended up choosing Raphael, because of the clean API and "free" IE support, and also because the active development looks promising (event support was just added in 0.7, for instance). However, I\'ll leave the question unanswered, and I\'d still be interested to hear about others\' experiences using Javascript + SVG libraries.I\'m a huge fan of Raphael and the development momentum seems to be going strong (version 0.85 was released late last week). Another big plus is that its developer, Dmitry Baranovskiy, is currently working on a Raphael charting plugin, g.raphael, which looks like its shaping up to be pretty slick (there are a few samples of the output from the early versions on Flickr).However, just to throw another possible contender into the SVG library mix, Google\'s SVG Web looks very promising indeed (even though I\'m not a big fan of Flash, which it uses to render in non-SVG compliant browsers). Probably one to watch, especially with the upcoming SVG Open conference.Raphael is definitely easier to set up and get going, but note that there are ways of expressing things in SVG that are not possible in Raphael.  As noted above there are no "groups". This implies that you can\'t implement layers of Coordinate Transfomations. Instead there is only one coordinate transform available.If your design depends on nested coordinate transforms, Raphael is not for you.Oh Raphael has moved on significantly since June.\nThere is a new charting library that can work with it and these are very eye catching.\nRaphael also supports full SVG path syntax and is incorporating really advanced path methods. Come see 1.2.8+ at my site (Shameless plug) and then bounce over to the Dmitry\'s site from there.\nhttp://www.irunmywebsite.com/raphael/raphaelsource.htmlI think it is not totally unrelated but did you consider canvas? something like Process JS can make it simpler.You should also take a look at svgweb. It uses flash to render svg in IE, and optionally on other browsers (in the cases where it supports more than the browser itself does).http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/I will throw my vote behind Raphael - the cross-browser support, clean API and consistent updates (so far) make it a joy to use.  It plays very nicely with jQuery too.  Processing is cool, but more useful as a demo for bleeding-edge stuff at the moment.  As a Javascript beginner, I found Rapahel samples not so easy, I recommend  http://cancerbero.mbarreneche.com/raphaeltut, which is a real Step by step tutorial.For those who don\'t care about IE6/IE7, the same guy who wrote Raphael built an svg engine specifically for modern browsers: Snap.svg .. they have a really nice site with good docs: http://snapsvg.iosnap.svg couldn\'t be easier to use right out of the box and can manipulate/update existing SVGs or generate new ones. You can read this stuff on the snap.io about page but here\'s a quick run down:ConsProsImplements the full features of SVG like masking, clipping, patterns, full gradients, groups, and more.Ability to work with existing SVGs: content does not have to be generated with Snap for it to work with Snap, allowing you to create the content with any common design tools.Full animation support using a straightforward, easy-to-implement JavaScript APIWorks with strings of SVGs (for example, SVG files loaded via Ajax) without having to actually render them first, similar to a resource container or sprite sheet.check it out if you\'re interested: http://snapsvg.ioSince it\'s not mentioned here yet:\nYou should also take a look at Dojox.drawing, which also provides good SVG drawing capabilities. It has a pretty impressive set of features. I\'m just starting a project with it, but it seems to me that it\'s far superior (at least in terms of features) to Raphael and JQuerySVG. This presentation convinced me to use it instead of Raphael/JQuerySVG:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/elazutkin/dojo-gfx-svg-in-the-real-world-2114082Reference:\nhttp://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dojox/index.htmlReference on Dojocampus:\nhttp://docs.dojocampus.org/dojox/drawingDownload Dojo (including Dojox):\nhttp://dojotoolkit.org/download/Another svg javascript library you might want to look at is d3.js. http://d3js.org/I prefer using RaphaelJS because it has great cross-browser abilities. However, some SVG &  VML effects can\'t be achieved with RaphaelJS (complex gradients...).Google has also developped a library of its own to enable SVG support in IE:\nhttp://svgweb.googlecode.com/files/svgweb-2009-08-20-B.zipIf you don\'t need VML and IE8 support then use Canvas (PaperJS for example). Look at latest IE10 demos for Windows 7. They have amazing animations in Canvas. SVG is not capable to do anything close to them. \nOverall Canvas is available at all mobile browsers. SVG is not working at early versions of Android 2.0- 2.3 (as I know)Yes, Canvas is not scalable, but it so fast that you can redraw the whole canvas faster then browser capable to scroll view port. From my perspective Microsoft\'s optimizations provides means to use Canvas as regular GDI engine and implement graphics applications like we do them for Windows now.
