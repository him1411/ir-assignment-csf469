How do I create and/or send a pull request to another repository hosted on GitHub?(In addition of the official "GitHub Help \'Using pull requests\' page",\nsee also "Forking vs. Branching in GitHub", "What is the difference between origin and upstream in GitHub")Assuming that you have first forked a repo, here is what you should do in that fork that you own:Note: to write the Pull-Request itself, see "How to write the perfect pull request" (January 2015, GitHub)March 2016: New PR merge button option: see "Github squash commits from web interface on pull request after review comments?".The maintainer of the repo can chose to merge --squash those PR commits.Regarding the last point, since April, 10th 2013, "Redesigned merge button", the branch is deleted for you:Deleting branches after you merge has also been simplified.\n  Instead of confirming the delete with an extra step, we immediately remove the branch when you delete it and provide a convenient link to restore the branch in the event you need it again.That confirms the best practice of deleting the branch after merging a pull request.pull request isn\'t an official "git" term.\nGit uses the request-pull(!) command to build a request for merging:\nIt "summarizes the changes between two commits to the standard output, and includes the given URL in the generated summary."\nGithub launches its own version since day one (February 2008), but redesigned that feature in May 2010, stating that:<humour>That (pull request) isn\'t even defined properly by GitHub!Fortunately, a true business news organization would know, and there is an e-note in order to replace pull-replace by \'e-note\':So if your reposotory needs a e-note... ask Fox Business. They are in the know.</humour>To learn how to make a pull request I just followed two separate help pages on Github (linked below as bullet points). The following command line commands are for Part 1. Part 2, the actual pull request, is done entirely on Github\'s website.Part 1: fork someone\'s repo: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repoPart 2: make pull-request: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requestsIn order to make a pull request you need to do the following steps:It took me a while to figure this, hope this will help someone.For those of us who have a github.com account, but only get a nasty error message when we type "git" into the command-line, here\'s how to do it all in your browser :)I\'ve started a project to help people making their first GitHub pull request. You can do the hands-on tutorial to make your first PR hereThe workflow is simple asI followed tim peterson\'s instructions but I created a local branch for my changes. However, after pushing I was not seeing the new branch in GitHub. The solution was to add -u to the push command:
