I\'m doing:I\'m getting:Fatal: destination path \'.\' already exists and is not an empty\n  directory.I know path . already exists.\nAnd I can assure that directory IS empty. (I do ls inside and I see nothing!)What am I missing here in order to clone that project into the current directory ?simply put a dot next to itFrom git help clone:Cloning into an existing directory is only allowed if the directory is empty.So make sure the directory is empty (check with ls -a), otherwise the command will fail.The following is probably not fully equivalent to a clone in all cases but did the trick for me:In my case, this produces a .git/config file which is equivalent to the one I get when doing a clone.@Andrew has answered it clearly here. But as simple as this also works even if the directory is not empty:To be sure that you could clone the repo, go to any temporary directory and clone the project there:This will clone your stuff into a project_hub directory.Once the cloning has finished, you could move this directory wherever you want:This is safe and doesn\'t require any magical stuff around.In addition to @StephaneDelcroix\'s answer, before using:make sure that your current dir is empty by usingIf the current directory is empty, then this will work:Improving on @GoZoner\'s answer:The shopt command is taken from this SO answer and changes the behavior of the \'mv\' command on Bash to include dotfiles, which you\'ll need to include the .git directory and any other hidden files.Also note that this is only guaranteed to work as-is if the current directory (.) is empty, but it will work as long as none of the files in the cloned repo have the same name as files in the current directory. If you don\'t care what\'s in the current directory, you can add the -f (force) option to the \'mv\' command.Solution:\nOn this case, the solution was using the dot,\nso: rm -rf .* && git clone ssh://user@host.com/home/user/private/repos/project_hub.git .rm -rf .* && may be omitted if we are absolutely sure that the directory is empty.Credits go to:\n@James McLaughlin on comments below.I see this:Amongst my searchings, I stumbled on to:https://couchpota.to/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3943Look for the entry by Clinton.Hall...\nIf you try this (as I did), you will probably get the access denied response, there was my 1st clue, so the initial error (for me), was actually eluding to the wrong root issue.Solution for this in windows:\nmake sure you run cmd or git elevated, then run:The above was my issue and simply elevating worked for me.use .(dot) at the end of your command like belowgit clone URL .Removing with rm -rf .*may get you into trouble or some more errors.If you have /path/to/folder, and would like to remove everything inside, but not that folder, just run:rm -rf /path/to/folder/*I had this same need. In my case I had a standard web folder which is created by a web server install. For the purposes of this illustration let\'s say this is/server/webrootand webroot contains other standard files and folders. My repo just has the site specific files (html, javascript, CFML, etc.)All I had to do was:You need to be careful to do the git init in the target folder because if you do NOT one of two things will happen:fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .gitThis did NOT disturb any of the "standard" files I have in my webroot folder but I did need to add them to the .gitignore file to prevent the inadvertent addition of them to subsequent commits.This seems like an easy way to "clone" into a non-empty directory. If you don\'t want the .git and .gitignore files created by the pull, just delete them after the pull.it\'s useful to create a new file by mkdir filename,then running the command of git clone xxxxx,it does work in my computerif repo is private\nfirst add your ssh key\nuse => git clone git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepo.git\nelse\nuse => git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.gitI have seen this question so many times - and I just want to point out that git pull from within your directory will do the trick. Unless I\'m missing something here - that worked for me.
