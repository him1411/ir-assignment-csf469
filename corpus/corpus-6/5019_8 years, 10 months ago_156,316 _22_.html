I want to deal with the command line input in Ruby:What is the best way to do it? In particular I want to deal with blank STDIN, and I hope for an elegant solution.Following are some things I found in my collection of obscure Ruby.So, in Ruby, a simple no-bells implementation of the Unix command cat would be:ARGF is your friend when it comes to input; it is a virtual file that gets all input from named files or all from STDIN.Thank goodness we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the diamond operator in Ruby, but we did get ARGF as a replacement. Though obscure, it actually turns out to be useful. Consider this program, which prepends copyright headers in-place (thanks to another Perlism, -i) to every file mentioned on the command-line:Credit to:Ruby provides another way to handle STDIN: The -n flag. It treats your entire program as being inside a loop over STDIN, (including files passed as command line args). See e.g. the following 1-line script:I am not quite sure what you need, but I would use something like this:Note that because ARGV array is empty before first gets, Ruby won\'t try to interpret argument as text file from which to read (behaviour inherited from Perl).If stdin is empty or there is no arguments, nothing is printed.Few test cases:Something like this perhaps?Example:This is inspired by Perl:I\'ll add that in order to use ARGF with parameters, you need to clear ARGV before calling ARGF.each. This is because ARGF will treat anything in ARGV as a filename and read lines from there first.Here\'s an example \'tee\' implementation:I do something like this : It seems most answers are assuming the arguments are filenames containing content to be cat\'d to the stdin.  Below everything is treated as just arguments.  If STDIN is from the TTY, then it is ignored.Either arguments or stdin can be empty or have data.Quick and simple:STDIN.gets.chomp == \'YES\'
