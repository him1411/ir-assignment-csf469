I am looking for a more elegant way of concatenating strings in Ruby.I have the following line:Is there a nicer way of doing this?And for that matter what is the difference between << and +?You can do that in several ways:With string interpolationwith +The second method seems to be more efficient in term of memory/speed from what I\'ve seen (not measured though). All three methods will throw an uninitialized constant error when ROOT_DIR is nil.When dealing with pathnames, you may want to use File.join to avoid messing up with pathname separator.In the end, it is a matter of taste.The + operator is the normal concatenation choice, and is probably the fastest way to concatenate strings.The difference between + and << is that << changes the object on its left hand side, and + doesn\'t.If you are just concatenating paths you can use Ruby\'s own File.join method.from http://greyblake.com/blog/2012/09/02/ruby-perfomance-tricks/Using << aka concat is far more efficient than +=, as the latter creates a temporal object and overrides the first object with the new object.output:Since this is a path I\'d probably use array and join:I\'d prefer using Pathname:about << and + from ruby docs:+: Returns a new String containing other_str concatenated to str<<: Concatenates the given object to str. If the object is a Fixnum between 0 and 255, it is converted to a character before concatenation.so difference is in what becomes to first operand (<< makes changes in place, + returns new string so it is memory heavier) and what will be if first operand is Fixnum (<< will add as if it was character with code equal to that number, + will raise error)Let me show to you all my experience with that.I had an query that returned 32k of records, for each record I called a method to format that database record into a formated string and than concatenate that into a String that at the end of all this process wil turn into a file in disk.My problem was that by the record goes, around 24k, the process of concatenating the String turned on a pain.I was doing that using the regular \'+\' operator.When I changed to the \'<<\' was like magic. Was really fast.So, I remembered my old times - sort of 1998 - when I was using Java and concatenating String using \'+\' and changed from String to StringBuffer (and now we, Java developer have the StringBuilder). I believe that the process of + / << in Ruby world is the same as + / StringBuilder.append in the Java world. The first reallocate the entire object in memory and the other just point to a new address.Concatenation you say? How about #concat method then?In all fairness, concat is aliased as <<.Here are more ways to do this:And so on ... Here\'s another benchmark inspired by this gist. It compares concatenation (+), appending (<<) and interpolation (#{}) for dynamic and predefined strings.output:Conclusion: interpolation in MRI is heavy.
