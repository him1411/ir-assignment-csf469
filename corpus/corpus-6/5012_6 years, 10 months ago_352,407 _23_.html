I have a directory that stores all the .py files.I want to use classes from user.py and dir.py in main.py.\nHow can I import these Python classes into main.py?\nFurthermore, how can I import class User if user.py is in a sub directory?Make an empty file called __init__.py in the same directory as the files. That will signify to Python that it\'s "ok to import from this directory".Then just do...The same holds true if the files are in a subdirectory - put an __init__.py in the subdirectory as well, and then use regular import statements, with dot notation. For each level of directory, you need to add to the import path. So if the directory was named "classes", then you\'d do this:Same as previous, but prefix the module name with a . if not using a subdirectory:I just learned (thanks to martineau\'s comment) that, in order to import classes from files within the same directory, you would now write in Python 3:In your main.py:where Class is the name of the class you want to import.If you want to call a method of Class, you can call it using:Class.methodNote that there should be an empty __init__.py file in the same directory. To make it more simple to understand:Step 1: lets go to one directory, where all will be includedStep 2: now lets make a class1.py file which has a class name Class1 with some codeStep 3: now lets make a class2.py file which has a class name Class2 with some codeStep 4: now lets make one main.py which will be execute once to use Class1 and Class2 from 2 different filesStep 5: apple biteyou can import the module and have access through it\'s name if you don\'t want to mix functions and classes with yoursor you can import the functions and classes to your code you can use wildchar * to import everything in that module to your codeJust too brief,\nCreate a file __init__.py is classes directory and then import it to your script like following
