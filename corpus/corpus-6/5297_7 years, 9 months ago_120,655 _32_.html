I\'m currently returning 401 Unauthorized whenever I encounter a validation failure in my Django/Piston based REST API application.\nHaving had a look at the HTTP Status Code Registry\nI\'m not convinced that this is an appropriate code for a validation failure, what do y\'all recommend?Update: "Validation failure" above means an application level data validation failure, i.e., incorrectly specified datetime, bogus email address etc.If "validation failure" means that there is some client error in the request, then use HTTP 400 (Bad Request).  For instance if the URI is supposed to have an ISO-8601 date and you find that it\'s in the wrong format or refers to February 31st, then you would return an HTTP 400.  Ditto if you expect well-formed XML in an entity body and it fails to parse.(1/2016): Over the last five years WebDAV\'s more specific HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) has become a very reasonable alternative to HTTP 400.  See for instance its use in JSON API. But do note that HTTP 422 has not made it into HTTP 1.1, RFC-7231.Richardson and Ruby\'s RESTful Web Services contains a very helpful appendix on when to use the various HTTP response codes.  They say:400 (\xe2\x80\x9cBad Request\xe2\x80\x9d)\n  Importance: High.\n  This is the generic client-side error status, used when no other 4xx error code is appropriate. It\xe2\x80\x99s commonly used when the client submits a representation along with a\n  PUT or POST request, and the representation is in the right format, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make\n  any sense. (p. 381)and:401 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnauthorized\xe2\x80\x9d)\n  Importance: High.\n  The client tried to operate on a protected resource without providing the proper authentication credentials. It may have provided the wrong credentials, or none at all.\n  The credentials may be a username and password, an API key, or an authentication\n  token\xe2\x80\x94whatever the service in question is expecting. It\xe2\x80\x99s common for a client to make\n  a request for a URI and accept a 401 just so it knows what kind of credentials to send\n  and in what format. [...]From RFC 4918 (and also documented at http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml):The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server\n    understands the content type of the request entity (hence a\n    415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the\n    syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request)\n    status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained\n    instructions.  For example, this error condition may occur if an XML\n    request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but\n    semantically erroneous, XML instructions.A duplicate in the database should be a 409 CONFLICT.I recommend using 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY for validation errors.I give a longer explanation of 4xx codes here: http://parker0phil.com/2014/10/16/REST_http_4xx_status_codes_syntax_and_sematics/Here it is: rfc2616#section-10.4.1 - 400 Bad RequestThe request could not be understood by the server due to malformed \n  syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.rfc7231#section-6.5.1 - 6.5.1.  400 Bad RequestThe 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot\n   or    will not process the request due to something that is perceived\n  to be    a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request    message framing, or deceptive request routing).Refers to malformed (not wellformed) cases!rfc4918 - 11.2.  422 Unprocessable EntityThe 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server\n  understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions.  For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous, XML instructions.ConclusionRule of thumb: [_]00 covers the most general case and cases that are not covered by designated code.422 fits best object validation error (precisely my recommendation:)\nAs for semantically erroneous - Think of something like "This username already exists" validation. 400 is incorrectly used for object validation I would say technically it might not be an HTTP failure, since the resource was (presumably) validly specified, the user was authenticated, and there was no operational failure (however even the spec does include some reserved codes like 402 Payment Required which aren\'t strictly speaking HTTP-related either, though it might be advisable to have that at the protocol level so that any device can recognize the condition).If that\'s actually the case, I would add a status field to the response with application errors, like<status><code>4</code><message>Date range is invalid</message></status>There\'s a little bit more information about the semantics of these errors in RFC 2616, which documents HTTP 1.1.Personally, I would probably use 400 Bad Request, but this is just my personal opinion without any factual support.What exactly do you mean by "validation failure"? What are you validating? Are you referring to something like a syntax error (e.g. malformed XML)?If that\'s the case, I\'d say 400 Bad Request is probably the right thing, but without knowing what it is you\'re "validating", it\'s impossible to say.
