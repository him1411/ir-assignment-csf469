I tried to parse a JSON file using PHP. But I am stuck now.This is the content of my JSON file:And this is what I have tried so far:But because I don\'t know the names (like \'John\', \'Jennifer\') and all available keys and values (like \'age\', \'count\') beforehand, I think I need to create some foreach loop.I would appreciate an example for this.To iterate over a multidimensional array, you can use RecursiveArrayIteratorOutput:run on codepadI can\'t believe so many people are posting answers without reading the JSON properly.If you foreach iterate $json_a alone, you have an object of objects. Even if you pass in true as the second parameter, you have a two-dimensional array. If you\'re looping through the first dimension you can\'t just echo the second dimension like that. So this is wrong:To echo the statuses of each person, try this:The most elegant solution:Remember that the json-file has to be encoded in UTF-8 without BOM. If the file has BOM, then json_decode will return NULL.Alternatively:It\'s completely beyond me that no one pointed out that your begining "tags" are wrong. You\'re creating an object with {}, while you could create an array with []. With this change, the json will be parsed as an array instead of an object. And with that array, you can do whatever you want, like loops etc. TryTry:Loop through the JSON with a foreach loop as key-value pairs. Do type-checking to determine if more looping needs to be done.More standard answer:And the output is:Try ThisTry it:When you decode a json string, you will get an object. not an array. So the best way to see the structure you are getting, is to make a var_dump of the decode. (this var_dump can help you understand the structure, mainly in complex cases).You have to give like this:Which gives the result :The quickest way to echo all json values is using loop in loop, the first loop is going to get all the objects and the second one the values...
