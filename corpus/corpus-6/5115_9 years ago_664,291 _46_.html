How do I get timestamp from e.g. 22-09-2008?PHP\'s strtotime() givesWhich does work with the Supported Date and Time Formats Docs.There is also strptime() which expects exactly one format:Be careful with functions like strtotime() that try to "guess" what you mean (it doesn\'t guess of course, the rules are here).Indeed 22-09-2008 will be parsed as 22 September 2008, as it is the only reasonable thing. How will 08-09-2008 be parsed? Probably 09 August 2008. What about 2008-09-50? Some versions of PHP parse this as 20 October 2008.So, if you are sure your input is in DD-MM-YYYY format, it\'s better to use the solution offered by @Armin Ronacher.With DateTime API:The same with the procedural API:If the above fails because you are using a unsupported format, you can useNote that if you do not set the !, the time portion will be set to current time, which is different from the first four which will use midnight when you omit the time.Yet another alternative is to use the IntlDateFormatter API:Unless you are working with localized date strings, the easier choice is likely DateTime.Using mktime:If you have PHP 5.3 or above,this method works on both Windows and Unix and is time-zone aware, which is probably what you want if you are serious about working with dates.If you don\'t care about timezone, or want to use the time zone your server uses:1222093324 (This will differ depending on your server time zone...)If you want to specify in which time zone, here EST. (Same as New York.)1222093305Or if you want to use UTC. (Same as "GMT".)1222093289Here is a very simple and effective solution using the split and mtime functions:It worked like a charm for me.Using strtotime() function you can easily convert date to timestamp More info: http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.phpOnline conversion tool: http://freeonlinetools24.com/Given that the function strptime() does not work for Windows and strtotime() can return unexpected results, I recommend using date_parse_from_format():If you know the format use strptime because strtotime does a guess for the format, which might not always be correct. Since strptime is not implemented in Windows there is a custom functionRemember that the returnvalue tm_year is from 1900! and tm_month is 0-11Example:http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.phpIf you want to know for sure whether a date gets parsed into something you expect, you can use DateTime::createFromFormat():It\'s obvious in this case, but e.g. 03-04-2008 could be 3rd of April or 4th of March depending on where you come from :)If you want, put it in a MySQL input type timestamp. The above works very well (only in PHP 5 or later):Here is how I\'d do it:This way, you let the function know what date format you are using and even specify the timezone.Please be careful about time/zone if you set it to save dates in database, as I got an issue when I compared dates from mysql that converted to timestamp using strtotime. you must use exactly same time/zone before converting date to timestamp otherwise, strtotime() will use default server timezone.Please see this example: https://3v4l.org/BRlmVIf you\'re looking to convert a UTC datetime (2016-02-14T12:24:48.321Z) to timestamp, here\'s how you\'d do it:
