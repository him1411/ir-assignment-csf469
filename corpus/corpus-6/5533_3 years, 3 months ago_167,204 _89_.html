How can I get the nth character of a string? I tried bracket([]) accessor with no luck. Swift 2:Swift 3:Now, these all equal true.Swift 3.1... but for that you\'d need to add this String extension (fully tested):No indexing using integers, only using String.Index. Mostly with linear complexity. You can also create ranges from String.Index and get substrings using them.Swift 3.0Swift 2.xNote that you can\'t ever use an index (or range) created from one string to another stringI just came up with this neat workaroundXcode 9 \xe2\x80\xa2 Swift 4TestingXcode 8.3 \xe2\x80\xa2 Swift 3.1CharAtIndex nSwift 2Swift 3SubString fromIndex toIndexSwift 2Swift 3First n charsLast n charsSwift 2.0 as of Xcode 7 GM SeedFor the nth character, replace 0 with n-1.Edit: Swift 3.0\nn.b. there are simpler ways of grabbing certain characters in the stringe.g. let firstChar = text.characters.firstIf you see Cannot subscript a value of type \'String\'... use this extension:Swift 3Swift 2.3Source: http://oleb.net/blog/2014/07/swift-strings/The following extension works in Xcode 7, this is a combination of this solution and Swift 2.0 syntax conversion. As an aside note, there are a few functions applyable directly to the Character-chain representation of a String, like this:The result is of type Character, but you can cast it to a String.Or this::-)The swift string class does not provide the ability to get a character at a specific index because of its native support for UTF characters. The variable length of a UTF character in memory makes jumping directly to a character impossible. That means you have to manually loop over the string each time.You can extend String to provide a method that will loop through the characters until your desired indexI just had the same issue. Simply do this:My solution is in one line, supposing cadena is the string and 4 is the nth position that you want:Simple... I suppose Swift will include more things about substrings in future versions.In order to feed the subject and show swift subscript possibilities, here\'s a little string "substring-toolbox" subscript basedThese methods are safe and never go over string indexesfirst(str) // retrieve first letterMore here:\nhttp://sketchytech.blogspot.com/2014/08/swift-pure-swift-method-for-returning.htmlUpdate for swift 2.0 subString I think that a fast answer for get the first character could be:It\'s so much elegant and performance than: But.. if you want manipulate and do more operations with strings you could think create an extension..here is one extension with this approach, it\'s quite similar to that already posted here:}BUT IT\'S A TERRIBLE IDEA!! The extension below is horribly inefficient. Every time a string is accessed with an integer, an O(n) function to advance its starting index is run. Running a linear loop inside another linear loop means this for loop is accidentally O(n2) \xe2\x80\x94 as the length of the string increases, the time this loop takes increases quadratically.Instead of doing that you could use the characters\'s string collection.Swift 3: another solution (tested in playground)Usage:Swift\'s String type does not provide a characterAtIndex method because there are several ways a Unicode string could be encoded. Are you going with UTF8, UTF16, or something else?You can access the CodeUnit collections by retrieving the String.utf8 and String.utf16 properties. You can also access the UnicodeScalar collection by retrieving the String.unicodeScalars property.In the spirit of NSString\'s implementation, I\'m returning a unichar type.A python-like solution, which allows you to use negative index, could be:By the way, it may be worth it to transpose the whole python\'s slice notationIn Swift 3Using characters  would do the job. You can quickly convert the String to an array of characters that can be manipulated by the CharacterView methods.Example:(full CharacterView doc)(tested in Swift 3)You could use SwiftString (https://github.com/amayne/SwiftString) to do this.DISCLAIMER: I wrote this extensionYou can also convert String to Array of Characters like that:This is the way to get char at specified index in constant time.The example below doesn\'t run in constant time, but requires linear time. So If You have a lot of searching in String by index use the method above.Swift 3UsageHelpful Programming Tips and Tricks (written by me)I wanted to point out that if you have a large string and need to randomly access many characters from it, you may want to pay the extra memory cost and convert the string to an array for better performance:In Swift 3 without extensions to the String class, as simple as I can make it!myCharacter is "3" in this example.Swift3You can use subscript syntax to access the Character at a particular String index.Visit https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.htmlAllows Negative IndicesIts always useful not always having to write string[string.length - 1] to get the last character when using a subscript extension. This (Swift 3) extension  allows for negative indices, Range and CountableClosedRange. How you can use it:For the more thorough Programmer: Include a guard against empty Strings in this extensionHere\'s an extension you can use, working with Swift 3.1. A single index will return a Character, which seems intuitive when indexing a String, and a Range will return a String.Some examples of the extension in action:n.b. You could add an additional method to the above extension to return a String with a single character if wanted:Note that then you would have to explicitly specify the type you wanted when indexing the string:
