This question already has an answer here:I\'m getting a datetime string in a format like "2009-05-28T16:15:00" (this is ISO 8601, I believe) one hack-ish option seems to be to parse the string using time.strptime and passing the first 6 elements of the touple into the datetime constructor, like:I haven\'t been able to find a "cleaner" way of doing this, is there one?I prefer using the dateutil library for timezone handling and generally solid date parsing. If you were to get an ISO 8601 string like: 2010-05-08T23:41:54.000Z you\'d have a fun time parsing that with strptime, especially if you didn\'t know up front whether or not the timezone was included. pyiso8601 has a couple of issues (check their tracker) that I ran into during my usage and it hasn\'t been updated in a few years. dateutil, by contrast, has been active and worked for me: With Python 2.5:Because RFC 3339 allows many variations of optional colons and dashes being present, basically CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[Z|(+|-)hh:mm]. If you want to use strptime, you need to strip out those variations first.\n\nThe goal is to generate a utc datetime object.\nArrow looks promising for this:Arrow is a Python library that provides a sensible, intelligent way of creating, manipulating, formatting and converting dates and times. Arrow is simple, lightweight and heavily inspired by moment.js and requests.You should keep an eye on the timezone information, as you might get into trouble when comparing non-tz-aware datetimes with tz-aware ones.It\'s probably the best to always make them tz-aware (even if only as utc), unless you really know why it wouldn\'t be of any use to do so. I haven\'t tried it yet, but pyiso8601 promises to support this.Isodate seems to have the most complete support.Both ways:Epoch to ISO time:ISO time to Epoch:This also includes the milliseconds and time zone.If the time is \'2012-09-30T15:31:50.262-08:00\', this will convert into epoch time.aniso8601 should handle this. It also understands timezones, python2 and python3, and has a reasonable coverage of the rest of ISO8601 should you ever need it.Here is a supper simple way to do these kind of conversions. \nNo parsing, or extra libraries required.\nClean, Simple, and Fast.
