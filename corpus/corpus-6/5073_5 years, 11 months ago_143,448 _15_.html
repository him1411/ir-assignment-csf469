Is there a foreach construct in the Go language? Can I iterate over a slice or array using a for?http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#For_statementsA "for" statement with a "range" clause iterates through all entries\n  of an array, slice, string or map, or values received on a channel.\n  For each entry it assigns iteration values to corresponding iteration\n  variables and then executes the block.As an example:If you don\'t care about the index, you can use _:The underscore, _, is the blank identifier, an anonymous placeholder.Iterate over array or slice:Iterate over a map:Iterate over a channel:Equivalent to:The following example shows how to use the range operator in a for loop to implement a foreach loop.The example iterates over an array of functions to unify the error handling for the functions. A complete example is at Google\xc2\xb4s playground.PS: it shows also that hanging braces are a bad idea for the readability of code. Hint: the for condition ends just before the action() call. Obvious, isn\'t it?You can in fact use range without referencing it\'s return values by using for range against your type:https://play.golang.org/p/XHrHLbJMEd
