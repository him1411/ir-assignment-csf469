The problem statement is simple. I need to see if user has selected a radio button from a radio group. Every radio button in the group share same id.The problem is that I don\'t have control on how the form is generated. Here is the sample code of how a radio button control code looks like:In addition to this when a radio button is selected it doesn\'t add a "checked" attribute to the control just text checked (I guess just the property checked without a value). Below is how a selected radio control looks likeCan anybody help me with jQuery code that can help me to get the value of checked radio button?Just use.So easy it is.First, you cannot have multiple elements with the same id.  I know you said you can\'t control how the form is created, but...try to somehow remove all the ids from the radios, or make them unique.To get the value of the selected radio button, select it by name with the :checked filter.EDITSo you have no control over the names.  In that case I\'d say put these radio buttons all inside a div, named, say, radioDiv, then slightly modify your selector:Make sure to wrap this in the DOM ready function ($(function(){...}); or $(document).ready(function(){...});).Simplest way to get the selected radio button\'s value is as follows:No space should be used in between selector.This will return, checked radio button value.To get the value of the selected Radio Button, Use RadioButtonName and the Form Id containing the RadioButton.OR by only Check the example it works fineGet all radios:Filter to get the one that\'s checkedORAnother way you can find radio button valueThe best way to explain this simple topic is by giving simple example and reference link:-In the following example we have two radio buttons. If the user selects any radio button, we will display the selected radio button value in a alert box.Html:jquery:-Try this with exampleI am not a javascript person, but I found here for searching this problem. For who google it and find here, I am hoping that this helps some. So, as in question if we have a list of radio buttons:I can find which one selected with this selector:Even if there is no element selected, I still don\'t get undefined error. So, you don\'t have to write extra if statement before taking element\'s value.Here is very basic jsfiddle example.and handle jquery for alert as for th e value set / Changed through div id:it is so easy....:-}Here are 2 radio buttons namely rd1 and Radio1 The simplest wayt to check which radio button is checked ,by checking individual is(":checked")  property
