This seems like a solved problem but I am unable to find a solution for it.Basically, I read a JSON file, change a key, and write back the new JSON to the same file. All works, but I loose the JSON formatting.So, instead of:I getIs there a way in Node.js to write well formatted JSON to file ?JSON.stringify\'s third parameter defines white-space insertion for pretty-printing. It can be a string or a number (number of spaces). Node can write to your filesystem with fs.  Example:See the JSON.stringify() docs at MDN, Node fs docsI think this might be useful... I love example code :)You can use the native "util" module. It uses syntax-highlighting, smart indentation, removes quotes from keys and just makes the output as pretty as it gets.Edit:Even easier is console.dir(), which is a shortcut for console.log(util.inspect()).\nThe only difference is that it bypasses any custom inspect() function defined on an object.
