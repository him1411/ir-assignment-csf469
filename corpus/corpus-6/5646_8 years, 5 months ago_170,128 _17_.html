I have a function that returns information in seconds, but I need to store that information in hours:minutes:seconds.  Is there an easy way to convert the seconds to this format in python?By using the divmod() function, which does only a single division to produce both the quotient and the remainder, you can have the result very quickly with only two mathematical operations:or you can  doI can hardly name that an easy way (at least I can\'t remember the syntax), but it is possible to use time.strftime, which gives more control over formatting:gmtime is used to convert seconds to special tuple format that strftime() requires.and:without \':0>8\':and:but:If you need to get datetime.time value, you can use this trick:You cannot add timedelta to time, but can add it to datetime.UPD: Yet another variation of the same technique:Instead of 1 you can use any number greater than 0. Here we use the fact that datetime.fromordinal will always return datetime object with time component being zero.This is how I got it.Some examples:This is my quick trick:visit:\nhttps://humanfriendly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#humanfriendly.format_timespan\nfor more info.
