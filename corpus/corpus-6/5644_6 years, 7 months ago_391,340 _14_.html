How would I loop through a std::map in C++?\nMy map is defined as:For example, this holds data like this:How can I loop through this map and access the various values?Old question but the remaining answers are outdated as of C++11 - you can use a ranged based for loop and simply do:this should be much cleaner than the earlier versions, and avoids unnecessary copies. Some favour replacing the comments with explicit definitions of reference variables (which get optimised away if unused):You can use an iterator.or nicer in C++0x:Do something like this:In C++17, you will be able to use the "structured bindings" feature, which lets you define multiple variables, with different names, using a single tuple/pair. Example:The original proposal (by luminaries Bjarne Stroustrup, Herb Sutter and Gabriel Dos Reis) is fun to read (and the suggested syntax is more intuitive IMHO); there\'s also the proposed wording for the standard which is boring to read but is closer to what will actually go in.C++11:output:use std::map< std::string, std::map<std::string, std::string> >::const_iterator when map is const.
