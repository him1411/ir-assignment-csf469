I am playing with Fragment in Android.I know I can change fragment by using the following code:My question is, in a Java file, how can I get the currently displayed Fragment instance ?When you add the fragment in your transaction you should use a tag....and later if you want to check if the fragment is visible:See also http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.htmlI know it\'s an old post, but was having trouble with it previously too. Found a solution which was to do this in the onBackStackChanged() listening functionThis worked for me as I didn\'t want to iterate through every fragment I have to find one that is visible. Hope it helps someone else too.Here is my solution which I find handy for low fragment scenariosEvery time when you show fragment you must put it tag into backstack:And then when you need to get current fragment you may use this method:What I am using to find current displaying fragment is in below code. It is simple and it works for me by now. It runs in the activity which holds the fragmentsThe reactive way:My method is based on try / catch like this :But there may be a better way ...1)2)3)Inspired by Tainy\'s answer, here is my two cents. Little modified from most other implementations.Replace "myActivity" with "this" if it is your current activity or use reference to your activity.Well, this question got lots of views and attention but still did not contained \nthe easiest solution from my end - to use getFragments().It\'s a bit late, But for anyone who is interested :\nIf you know the index of the your desired fragment in FragmentManager just get a reference to it and check for isMenuVisible() function! here :If true Its visible to user and so on!If you are getting the current instance of Fragment from the parent activity you can justThis actually get\'s the current instance of fragment that\'s populated on the view. I had the same issue. I had to load the same fragment twice keeping one on backstack. The following method doesn\'t work. It just gets a Fragment that has the tag. Don\'t waste your time on this method. I am sure it has it\'s uses but to get the most recent version of the same Fragment is not one of them.There\'s a method called findFragmentById() in SupportFragmentManager. I use it in the activity container like : That\'s how to get your current Fragment. If you have custom Fragment and need to check what Fragment it is, I normally use instanceof :This is work for me. I hope this will hepl someone.In the main activity, the onAttachFragment(Fragment fragment) method is called when a new fragment is attached to the activity. In this method, you can get the instance of the current fragment. However, the onAttachFragment method is not called when a fragment is popped off the backstack, ie, when the back button is pressed to get the top fragment on top of the stack. I am still looking for a callback method which is triggered in the main activity when a fragment becomes visible inside the activity.I ran into a similar problem, where I wanted to know what fragment was last displayed when the back key was pressed. I used a very simple solution that worked for me. Each time I open a fragment, in the onCreate() method, I set a variable in my singleton (replace "myFragment" with the name of your fragment)The variable is declared in the singleton as Then in the onBackPressed() I checkMake sure to call the super.onBackPressed(); after the "return", otherwise the app will process the back key, which in my case caused the app to terminate.Sev\'s answer works for when you hit the back button or otherwise change the backstack.I did something slightly different, though.  I have a backstack change listener setup on a base Fragment and its derived fragments and this code is in the listener:Maybe the simplest way is:It worked for meUsing an event bus (like Otto, EventBus or an RxJava Bus)  is especially handy in these situations.While this approach doesn\'t necessarily hand you down the currently visible fragment as an object (though that too can be done but it leads to a longer call chain), it allows you execute actions on the currently visible fragment (which is usually what you want to do knowing the currently visible fragment).all visible fragments that have registered with the bus will execute the necessary action.A bit strange but I looked at FragmentManager$FragmentManagerImpl and the following works for me:to get the first active fragment use 0 as the indexThis works for me. You need to perform a null check before you iterate through the fragments list. There could be a scenario that no fragments are loaded on the stack.The returning fragment can be compared with the fragment you want to put on the stack.Please try this method ..... You can get current fragment by using following codeYou can add a class variable selectedFragment, and every time you change the fragment you update the variable.then you can use selectedFragment wherever you wantHello I know this is an very old issue, but I would like to share my own solution..In order to get the browsed fragment list by the user, I created a helper class:And into the main Activity, I override onAttachFragment methodand also, I override onBackPressed Method:so by this way you any time can get the active fragment with MyHelperClass.getCurrentFragment()I hope this be helpful for anyoneregardswell i think you want to see in which fragment u\'re in \ni guess there is a sollution i dont think its the best \nbut it works \nFirst at allyou should create your parent fragment that it extends Fragment you should extend it in every fragment and in each write in onCreateView Thirdwhere you want to get the current fragment you shouldwrite thisthis is the best way:dont forget to define this in header :This is simple way to get current fragment..If you use the Support library v13 than this issue is fixed and you should simply override:The thing is, you can\'t mix the two because the fragment is not compatible with the Fragment Class of the of the version 4.If you are not and you are using the V4 support lib, Override the setPrimaryItem method to your FragmentStatePagerAdapter.I was using this to update the Actionbat title in big lists.
