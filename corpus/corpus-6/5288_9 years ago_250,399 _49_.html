When is it a good idea to use PHP_EOL?I sometimes see this in code samples of PHP. Does this handle DOS/Mac/Unix endline issues?Yes, PHP_EOL is ostensibly used to find the newline character in a cross-platform-compatible way, so it handles DOS/Mac/Unix issues.You use PHP_EOL when you want a new line, and you want to be cross-platform.This could be when you are writing files to the filesystem (logs, exports, other).  You could use it if you want your generated HTML to be readable.  So you might follow your <br /> with a PHP_EOL.You would use it if you are running php as a script from cron and you needed to output something and have it be formatted for a screen.You might use it if you are building up an email to send that needed some formatting.From main/php.h of PHP version 5.6.30 and version 7.1.1:As you can see PHP_EOL can be "\\r\\n" (on Windows servers) or "\\n" (on anything else). On PHP versions prior 5.4.0RC8, there were a third value possible for PHP_EOL: "\\r" (on MacOSX servers). It was wrong and has been fixed on 2012-03-01 with bug 61193.As others already told you, you can use PHP_EOL in any kind of output (where any of these values are valid - like: HTML, XML, logs...) where you want unified newlines (and you should want this in my opinion).I just wanted to show the possibles values of PHP_EOL backed by the PHP sources since it hasn\'t been shown here yet...PHP_EOL (string)\n  The correct \'End Of Line\' symbol for this platform.\n  Available since PHP 4.3.10 and PHP 5.0.2You can use this constant when you read or write text files on the server\'s filesystem.Line endings do not matter in most cases as most software are capable of handling text files regardless of their origin. You ought to be consistent with your code.If line endings matter, explicitly specify the line endings instead of using the constant. For example:I\'d like to throw in an answer that addresses "When not to use it" as it hasn\'t been covered yet and can imagine it being used blindly and no one noticing the there is a problem till later down the line. Some of this contradicts some of the existing answers somewhat.If outputting to a webpage in HTML, particularly text in <textarea>, <pre> or <code> you probably always want to use \\n and not PHP_EOL.The reason for this is that while code may work perform well on one sever - which happens to be a Unix-like platform - if deployed on a Windows host (such the Windows Azure platform) then it may alter how pages are displayed in some browsers (specifically Internet Explorer - some versions of which will see both the \\n and \\r).I\'m not sure if this is still an issue since IE6 or not, so it might be fairly moot but seems worth mentioning if it helps people prompt to think about the context. There might be other cases (such as strict XHTML) where suddently outputting \\r\'s on some platforms could cause problems with the output, and I\'m sure there are other edge cases like that.As noted by someone already, you wouldn\'t want to use it when returning HTTP headers - as they should always follow the RFC on any platform.I wouldn\'t use it for something like delimiters on CSV files (as someone has suggested). The platform the sever is running on shouldn\'t determine the line endings in generated or consumed files.The definition of PHP_EOL is that it gives you the newline character of the operating system you\'re working on.In practice, you should almost never need this. Consider a few cases:When you are outputting to the web, there really isn\'t any convention except that you should be consistent. Since most servers are Unixy, you\'ll want to use a "\\n" anyway.If you\'re outputting to a file, PHP_EOL might seem like a good idea. However, you can get a similar effect by having a literal newline inside your file, and this will help you out if you\'re trying to run some CRLF formatted files on Unix without clobbering existing newlines (as a guy with a dual-boot system, I can say that I prefer the latter behavior)PHP_EOL is so ridiculously long that it\'s really not worth using it.I found PHP_EOL very useful for file handling, specially if you are writing multiple lines of content into a file.For example, you have a long string that you want to break into the multiple lines while writing into plain file. Using \\r\\n might not work so simply put PHP_EOL into your script and the result is awesome.Check out this simple example below:No, PHP_EOL does not handle endline issues, because the system where you use that constant is not the same system where you send the output to.I would not recommend using PHP_EOL at all. Unix/Linux use \\n, MacOS / OS X changed from \\r to \\n too and on Windows many applications (especially browsers) can display it correctly too. On Windows, it is also easy change existing client-side code to use \\n only and still maintain backward-compatibility: Just change the delimiter for line trimming from \\r\\n to \\n and wrap it in a trim() like function.There is one obvious place where it might be useful: when you are writing code that predominantly uses single quote strings. Its arguable as to whether:The art of it is to be consistent. The problem with mix and matching \'\' and "" is that when you get long strings, you don\'t really want to have to go hunting for what type of quote you used. As with all things in life, it depends on the context.DOS/Windows standard "newline" is CRLF (= \\r\\n) and not LFCR (\\n\\r). If we put the latter, it\'s likely to produce some unexpected (well, in fact, kind of expected! :D) behaviors.Nowadays almost all (well written) programs accept the UNIX standard LF (\\n) for newline code, even mail sender daemons (RFC sets CRLF as newline for headers and message body).You are writing code that predominantly uses single quote strings.I have a site where a logging-script writes a new line of text to a textfile after an action from the user, who can be using any OS.Using PHP_EOL don\'t seem to be optimal in this case. If the user is on Mac OS and writes to the textfile it will put \\n. When opening the textfile on a windows computer it doesn\'t show a line break. For this reason i use "\\r\\n" instead which works when opening the file on any OS.Handy with error_log() if you\'re outputting multiple lines.I\'ve found a lot of debug statements look weird on my windows install since the developers have assumed unix endings when breaking up strings.I am using WebCalendar and found that Mac iCal barfs on importing a generated ics file because the end-of-line is hardcoded in xcal.php as "\\r\\n". I went in and replaced all occurrences with PHP_EOL and now iCal is happy! \nI also tested it on Vista and Outlook was able to import the file as well, even though the end of line character is "\\n".I use the PHP_EOL constant in some command line scripts I had to write. I develop on my local Windows machine and then test on a Linux server box. Using the constant meant I didn\'t have to worry about using the correct line ending for each of the different platforms.When jumi (joomla plugin for PHP) compiles your code for some reason it removes all backslashes from your code. Such that something like $csv_output .= "\\n"; becomes $csv_output .= "n";Very annoying bug!Use PHP_EOL instead to get the result you were after.I prefer to use \\n\\r. Also I am on a windows system and \\n works just fine in my experience.Since PHP_EOL does not work with regular expressions, and these are the most useful way of dealing with text, then I really never used it or needed to.
