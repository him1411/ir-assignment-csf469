I am currently wondering what is the difference between the two. When I used both they seem to break the word if it is not fitting the container. But why did W3C made two ways to do it?The W3 specification that talks about these seem to suggest that word-break: break-all is for requiring a particular behaviour with CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) text, whereas word-wrap: break-word is the more general, non-CJK-aware, behaviour.word-wrap: break-word recently changed to overflow-wrap: break-wordword-break: break-allSo if you have many fixed-size spans which get content dynamically, you might just prefer using word-wrap: break-word, as that way only the continuous words are broken in between, and in case it\xe2\x80\x99s a sentence comprising many words, the spaces are adjusted to get intact words (no break within a word).And if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, go for either.With word-break, a very long word starts at the point it should start \nand it is being broken as long as requiredHowever, with word-wrap, a very long word WILL NOT start at the point it should start.\nit wrap to next line and then being broken as long as requiredAt least in Firefox (as of v24) and Chrome (as of v30), when applied to content in a table element:word-wrap:break-word will not actually cause long words to wrap, which can result in the table exceeding the bounds of its container; word-break:break-all will result in words wrapping, and the table fitting within its container.  jsfiddle demo.This is all i can find out. Not sure if it helps, but thought I\'d add it to the mix.WORD-WRAPThis property specifies whether the current rendered line should break if the content exceeds the boundary of the specified rendering box for an element (this is similar in some ways to the \xe2\x80\x98clip\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98overflow\xe2\x80\x99 properties in intent.) This property should only apply if the element has a visual rendering, is an inline element with explicit height/width, is absolutely positioned and/or is a block element.WORD-BREAKThis property controls the line breaking behavior within words. It is especially useful in cases where multiple languages are used within an element.word-wrap has been renamed to overflow-wrap probably to avoid this confusion.Now this is what we have:The overflow-wrap property is used to specify whether or not the browser may break lines within words in order to prevent overflow when an otherwise unbreakable string is too long to fit in its containing box.Possible values:normal: Indicates that lines may only break at normal word break points.break-word: Indicates that normally unbreakable words may be broken at arbitrary points if there are no otherwise acceptable break points in the line.source.The word-break CSS property is used to specify whether to break lines within words.source.Now back to your question, the main difference between overflow-wrap and word-break is that the first determines the behavior on an overflow situation, while the later determines the behavior on a normal situation (no overflow). An overflow situation happens when the container doesn\'t have enough space to hold the text. Breaking lines on this situation doesn\'t help because there\'s no space (imagine a box with fix width and height).So:From the respective W3 specifications \xe2\x80\x94which happen to be pretty unclear due to a lack of context\xe2\x80\x94 one can deduce the following:At least, these were W3\'s intentions. What actually happened was a major cock-up with browser incompatibilities as a result. Here is an excellent write-up of the various problems involved.The following code snippet may serve as a summary of how to achieve word wrapping using CSS in a cross browser environment:word-break:break-all :word to continue to border then break in newline.word-wrap:break-word :At first , word wrap in newline then continue to border.Example :In addition to the previous comments browser support for word-wrap seems to be a bit better than for word-break.
