In our project we\'re using TransactionScope\'s to ensure our data access layer performs it\'s actions in a transaction. We\'re aiming to not require the MSDTC service to be enabled on our end-user\'s machines. Trouble is, on half of our developers machines, we can run with MSDTC disabled.  The other half must have it enabled or they get the "MSDTC on [SERVER] is unavailable" error message. It\'s really got me scratching my head and has me seriously considering rolling back to a home-spun TransactionScope-like solution based on ADO.NET transaction objects. It\'s seemingly insane - the same code that works (and does not escalate) on half of our developer\'s does escalate on the other developer\'s.I was hoping for a better answer to Trace why a transaction is escalated to DTC but unfortunately it doesn\'t. Here\'s a sample bit of code that will cause the trouble, on the machines that try to escalate, it tries to escalate on the second connection.Open() (and yes, there is no other connection open at the time.)We\'ve really dug in and tried to figure this out.  Here\'s some info on the machines that it works on:Developers it doesn\'t work on:I should add that all machines, in an effort to hunt down the problem, have been fully patched with everything that\'s available from Microsoft Update.That MSDN transaction-escalation page states that the following conditions will cause a transaction to escalate to DTC:We\'re not experiencing #3. #2 is not happening because there is only ever one connection at a time, and it\'s also to a single \'durable resource\'.  Is there any way that #1 could be happening?  Some SQL2005/8 configuration that causes it to not support single-phase notifications?Re-investigated, personally, everyone\'s SQL Server versions - "Dev 3" actually has SQL2008, and "Dev 4" is actually SQL2005.  That\'ll teach me to never trust my coworkers again. ;)  Because of this change in data, I\'m pretty sure we\'ve found our problem.  Our SQL2008 developers weren\'t experiencing the problem because SQL2008 has copious amounts of awesome included that SQL2005 does not have.It also tells me that because we\'re going to be supporting SQL2005 that we can\'t use TransactionScope like we have been, and if we want to use TransactionScope we\'re going to need to be passing a single SqlConnection object around...which seems problematic in situations where the SqlConnection can\'t easily be passed around...it just smells of global-SqlConnection instance.  Pew!Just to clarify up here in the question:SQL2008:SQL2005:In the interest of making this question even more of a mess useful, and just for more clarity\'s sake, here\'s how you can get SQL2005 to escalate to DTC with a single SqlConnection:This just seems broken to me, but I guess I can understand if every call to SqlConnection.Open() is grabbing from the connection pool.  "Why might this happen, though?"  Well, if you use a SqlTableAdapter against that connection before it\'s opened, the SqlTableAdapter will open and close the connection, effectively finishing the transaction for you because you now can\'t re-open it.So, basically, in order to successfully use TransactionScope with SQL2005 you need to have some sort of global connection object that remains open from the point of the first TransactionScope is instantiated until it\'s no longer needed.  Besides the code-smell of a global connection object, opening the connection first and closing it last is at odds against the logic of opening a connection as late as possible and closing it as soon as possible.  SQL2008 can use multiple SQLConnections in a TransactionScope without escalating, provided the connections are not open at the same time, which would result in multiple "physical" TCP connections and thus require escalation.I see some of your developers have SQL2005 and others SQL2008.  Are you sure you have correctly identified which ones are escalating and which not?The most obvious explanation would be that developers with SQL 2008 are the ones that aren\'t escalating.The result of my research on the topic:See Avoid unwanted Escalation to Distributed TransactionsI am still investigating Oracle\xe2\x80\x99s escalation behavior:\nDo transactions spanning multiple connections to same DB escalate to DTC?That code will cause an escalation when connecting to 2005.Check the documentation on MSDN - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms172070.aspxPromotable Transactions in SQL Server 2008In version 2.0 of the .NET Framework\n  and SQL Server 2005, opening a second\n  connection inside a TransactionScope\n  would automatically promote the\n  transaction to a full distributed\n  transaction, even if both connections\n  were using identical connection\n  strings. In this case, a distributed\n  transaction adds unnecessary overhead\n  that decreases performance.Starting with SQL Server 2008 and\n  version 3.5 of the .NET Framework,\n  local transactions are no longer\n  promoted to distributed transactions\n  if another connection is opened in the\n  transaction after the previous\n  transaction is closed. This requires\n  no changes to your code if you are\n  already using connection pooling and\n  enlisting in transactions.I can\'t explain why Dev 3: Windows 7 x64, SQL2005 succeeds and Dev 4: Windows 7 x64 fails. Are you sure that is not the other way round?I don\'t know why this answer was deleted but this seems to have some relevant information. answered Aug 4 \'10 at 17:42 EduardoSet Enlist=false on connection string to avoid auto enlistment on transaction.Manually enlist connection as participants in transaction scope. [original article outdated]\nor do this: How to prevent automatic MSDTC promotion  [archive.is]I\'m not too sure if nested connection is the issue.  I\'m calling a local instance of SQL server and it doesn\'t generate the DTC??TransactionScope always escalates to DTC transaction, if you use access more than 1 connection inside. The only way the code above can work with DTC disabled is if by a huge chance you get the same connection from the connection pool both times."Trouble is, on half of our developers machines, we can run with MSDTC disabled."\nAre you sure sure it\'s disabled ;)
