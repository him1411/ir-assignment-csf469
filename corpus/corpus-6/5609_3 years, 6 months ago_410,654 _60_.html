How do I copy the text inside a div to the clipboard? I have a div and need to add a link which will add the text to the clipboard. Is there a solution for this? After I click copy text, then I press Ctrl + V, it must be pasted.Edit as of 2016As of 2016, you can now copy text to the clipboard in most browsers because most browsers have the ability to programmatically copy a selection of text to the clipboard using document.execCommand("copy") that works off a selection.As with some other actions in a browser (like opening a new window), the copy to clipboard can only be done via a specific user action (like a mouse click).  For example, it cannot be done via a timer.Here\'s a code example:Here\'s a little more advanced demo: https://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/v9g1x0o6/And, you can also get a pre-built library that does this for you with clipboard.js.Old, historical part of answerDirectly copying to the clipboard via JavaScript is not permitted by any modern browser for security reasons. The most common workaround is to use a Flash capability for copying to the clipboard that can only be triggered by a direct user click.As mentioned already, ZeroClipboard is a popular set of code for managing the Flash object to do the copy. I\'ve used it. If Flash is installed on the browsing device (which rules out mobile or tablet), it works.The next most common work-around is to just place the clipboard-bound text into an input field, move the focus to that field and advise the user to press Ctrl + C to copy the text.Other discussions of the issue and possible work-arounds can be found in these prior Stack Overflow posts:How do I copy to the clipboard in JavaScript?How to copy text to the client's clipboard using jQuery?How can you copy to clipboard without Flash?These questions asking for a modern alternative to using Flash have received lots of question upvotes and no answers with a solution (probably because none exist):HTML5 alternative to flash-based ZeroClipboard for safe copying of data to clipboard?Copy to clipboard without FlashInternet Explorer and Firefox used to have non-standard APIs for accessing the clipboard, but their more modern versions have deprecated those methods (probably for security reasons).There is a nascent standards effort to try to come up with a "safe" way to solve the most common clipboard problems (probably requiring a specific user action like the Flash solution requires), and it looks like it may be partially implemented in the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome, but I haven\'t confirmed that yet.There is another non-Flash way (apart from the Clipboard API mentioned in jfriend00\'s answer). You need to select the text and then execute the command copy to copy to the clipboard whatever text is currently selected on the page.For example, this function will copy the content of the passed element into the clipboard (updated with suggestion in the comments from PointZeroTwo):This is how it works:You can see a quick demo here:The main issue is that not all browsers support this feature at the moment, but you can use it on the main ones from:Update 1: This can be achieved also with a pure JavaScript solution (no jQuery):Notice that we pass the id without the # now.As madzohan reported in the comments below, there is some strange issue with the 64-bit version of Google Chrome in some cases (running the file locally). This issue seems to be fixed with the non-jQuery solution above.Madzohan tried in Safari and the solution worked but using document.execCommand(\'SelectAll\') instead of using .select() (as specified in the chat and in the comments below).As PointZeroTwo points out in the comments, the code could be improved so it would return a success/failure result. You can see a demo on this jsFiddle.As a user pointed out in the Spanish version of StackOverflow, the solutions listed above work perfectly if you want to copy the content of an element literally, but they don\'t work that great if you want to paste the copied text with format (as it is copied into a input type="text", the format is "lost").A solution for that would be to copy  into a content editable div and then copy it using the execCommand in a similar way. Here there is an example - click on the copy button and then paste into the content editable box below:And in jQuery, it would be like this:clipboard.js is a nice utility that allows copying of text or HTML data to the clipboard without use of Flash. It\'s very easy to use; just include the .js and use something like this:clipboard.js is also on GitHub.Edit on Jan 15, 2016:  The top answer was edited today to reference the same API in my answer posted in August 2015.  The previous text was instructing users to use ZeroClipboard.  Just want to be clear that I didn\'t yank this from jfriend00\'s answer, rather the other way around.  Even better approach without flash or any other requirements is clipboard.js. All you need to do is add data-clipboard-target="#toCopyElement" on any button, initialize it new Clipboard(\'.btn\'); and it will copy the content of DOM with id toCopyElement to clipboard. This is a snippet that copy the text provided in your question via a link.One limitation though is that it does not work on safari, but it works on all other browser including mobile browsers as it does not use flashWith Line Breaks (Extention of the Answer from Alvaro Montoro) It is a simplest method to copy the contentThe text to copy is in text input,like:    <input type="text" id="copyText" name="copyText">  and, on button click above text should get copied to clipboard,so button is   like:<button type="submit" id="copy_button" data-clipboard-target=\'copyText\'>Copy</button>  Your script should be like:For CDN filesnote: ZeroClipboard.swf and ZeroClipboard.js" file should be in the same folder as your file using this functionality is, OR you have to include like we include <script src=""></script> on our pages.you can just using this lib for easy realize the copy goal!https://clipboardjs.com/Copying text to the clipboard shouldn\'t be hard. It shouldn\'t require\n  dozens of steps to configure or hundreds of KBs to load. But most of\n  all, it shouldn\'t depend on Flash or any bloated framework.That\'s why clipboard.js exists.orhttps://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboardhttp://zeroclipboard.org/The ZeroClipboard library provides an easy way to copy text to the\n  clipboard using an invisible Adobe Flash movie and a JavaScript\n  interface.html code hereJS CODE:
