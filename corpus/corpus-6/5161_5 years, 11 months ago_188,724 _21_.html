Basically, I want to do this:I\'m pretty sure that would work in MySQL (my background), but it doesn\'t seem to work in postgres. The error I get is:Surely there\'s an easy way to do this, but I can\'t find the proper syntax. So, how would I write this In PostgreSQL?The UPDATE syntax is:In your case I think you want this:Let me explain a little more by my example.Task: correct info, where abiturients (students about to leave secondary school) have submitted applications to university earlier, than they got school certificates (yes, they got certificates earlier, than they were issued (by certificate date specified). So, we will increase application submit date to fit certificate issue date. Thus. next MySQL-like statement:\nBecomes PostgreSQL-like in such a wayAs you can see, original subquery JOIN\'s ON clause have become one of WHERE conditions, which is conjucted by AND with others, which have been moved from subquery with no changes. And there is no more need to JOIN table with itself (as it was in subquery).The answer of Mark Byers is the optimal in this situation. \nThough in more complex situations you can take the select query that returns rowids and calculated values and attach it to the update query like this:This approach lets you develop and test your select query and in two steps convert it to the update query.So in your case the result query will be:Note that column aliases are mandatory otherwise PostgreSQL will complain about the ambiguity of the column names.For those actually wanting to do a join you can also use:You can use the a_alias in the SET section on the right of the equals sign if needed.\nThe fields on the left of the equals sign don\'t require a table reference as they are deemed to be from the original "a" table.Here we go:Simple as I could make it. Thanks guys!Can also do this:But then you\'ve got the vehicle table in there twice, and you\'re only allowed to alias it once, and you can\'t use the alias in the "set" portion.Here\'s a simple SQL that updates Mid_Name on the Name3 table using the Middle_Name field from Name:
