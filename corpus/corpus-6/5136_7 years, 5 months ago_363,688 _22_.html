I have the following JavaScript array of real estate home objects:What I would like to do is be able to perform a filter on the object to return a subset of "home" objects.For example, I want to be able to filter based on: price, sqft, num_of_beds, and num_of_baths.Question: How can I perform something in JavaScript like the pseudo-code below:Note, the syntax does not have to be exactly like above. This is just an example.You can use the Array.prototype.filter method:This method is part of the new ECMAScript 5th Edition standard, and can be found on almost all modern browsers.For IE, you can include the following method for compatibility:You can try using framework like jLinq - following is a code sample of using jLinqFor more information you can follow the link http://www.hugoware.net/projects/jlinq I prefer the Underscore framework. It suggests many useful operations with objects.\nYour task:can be overwriten like:Hope it will be useful for you!here is the working fiddle which works fine in IE8 using jquery MAP functionhttp://jsfiddle.net/533135/Cj4j7/You can use jQuery.grep() since jQuery 1.0:You could do this pretty easily - there are probably many implementations you can choose from, but this is my basic idea (and there is probably some format where you can iterate over an object with jQuery, I just cant think of it right now):And then you could invoke this function like so:This way, you can invoke the filter based on whatever predicate you define, or even filter multiple times using smaller filters. You can implement a filter method yourself that meets your needs, here is how:Hope, it helps!Or you can simply use $.each (which also works for objects, not only arrays) and build a new array like so:
