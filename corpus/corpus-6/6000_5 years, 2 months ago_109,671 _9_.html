Is there a really easy way to toggle a boolean value in javascript?So far, the best I\'ve got outside of writing a custom function is the ternary:This holds true in most languages.If you don\'t mind the boolean being converted to a number (that is either 0 or 1), you can use the Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator. Like so:\nThis is especially good if you use long, descriptive boolean names, EG:This is easier for me to scan than repeating the variable in each line.This method works in all (major) browsers (and most programming languages).One of the cases.if you want the value to hold true if tool (another boolean) has the same value
