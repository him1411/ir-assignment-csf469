I want to set up a complete Python IDE in Sublime Text 2.I want to know how to run the Python code from within the editor. Is it done using build system? How do I do it ?Tools -> Build System -> (choose) Python then:To Run:This would start your file in the console which should be at the bottom of the editor.To Stop:You can find out where your Break key is here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_key.    Note: CTRL + C will NOT work.What to do when Ctrl + Break does not work:Go to: Preferences -> Key Bindings - Userand paste the line below:  Now, you can use ctrl+shift+c instead of CTRL+BREAKEdit %APPDATA%\\Sublime Text 2\\Python\\Python.sublime-build Change content to:change the "c:\\python27" part to any version of python you have in your system. On Mac OS X, save your file with a .py extension. Press \xe2\x8c\x98 + B.  It runs in a window below.To RUN press CtrlB (answer by matiit)But when CtrlB does not work, Sublime Text probably can\'t find the Python Interpreter. When trying to run your program, see the log and find the reference to Python in path.The point is that it tries to run python via command line, the cmd looks like:If you can\'t run python from cmd, Sublime Text can\'t too.\n(Try it yourself in cmd, type python in it and run it, python commandline should appear)You can either change the Sublime Text build formula or the System %PATH%.  To set your %PATH%:\n*You will need to restart your editor to load new %PATH%Run Command Line* and enter this command: *needs to be run as administrator\nSETX /M PATH "%PATH%;<python_folder>"\nfor example: SETX /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\\Python27;C:\\Python27\\Scripts" OR manually: (preferable)\nAdd ;C:\\Python27;C:\\Python27\\Scripts at the end of the string.\n To set the interpreter\'s path without messing with System %PATH% see this answer by ppy.You can use SublimeREPL (you need to have Package Control installed first).If using python 3.x you need to edit the Python3.sublime-build (Preferences > Browse packages > Python 3) to look like this:[ This applies to ST3 (Win), not sure about ST2 ]To have the output visible in Sublime as another file (+ one for errors), do this:Cool U guys, I just found this:http://ptomato.wordpress.com/2012/02/09/geek-tip-running-python-guis-in-sublime-text-2/It explains (like one of the answers above) how to edit this exec.py in the default directory.I had the problem that my PYTHON UI APPLICATION would not start. I commented out the last line from the following snipped:and, taaadaaaa, I could start my app by pressing Ctrl+B. Funny line anyways, uh? And a big thank you to whoever wrote that article ;-)You can access the Python console via \xe2\x80\x9cView/Show console\xe2\x80\x9d or Ctrl+`.I solved this problem :Open the exec.py file, near line 41-42, the code should look like this :then delete it or edit it as :I had the same problem. You probably haven\'t saved the file yet. Make sure to save your code with .py extension and it should work.One thing to note about the aforementioned build system: you can write (and use) custom .sublime-build files or even per project build_systems clause (in your project settings). This allows you to do useful things like a fancy test runner with ANSI colors output.For even more "full IDE" features, you can use the excellent SublimePythonIDE package:Disclosure: I\'ve contributed a PR to that package, and I use it all the time, but there are others.I ran into the same problem today. And here is how I managed to run python code in Sublime Text 3:What you need to do next is replace the content in Python.sublime-build to You can of course further customise it to something that works for you.
