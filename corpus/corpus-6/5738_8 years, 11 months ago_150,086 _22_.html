I need to store a url in a MySQL table. What\'s the best practice for defining a field that will hold a URL with an undetermined length?Lowest common denominator max URL length among popular web browsers: 2,083 (Internet Explorer)http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/char.html\n  Values in VARCHAR columns are variable-length strings. The length can be specified as a value from 0 to 255 before MySQL 5.0.3, and 0 to 65,535 in 5.0.3 and later versions. The effective maximum length of a VARCHAR in MySQL 5.0.3 and later is subject to the maximum row size (65,535 bytes, which is shared among all columns) and the character set used.So ...\n  < MySQL 5.0.3 use TEXT\n  or\n  >= MySQL 5.0.3 use VARCHAR(2083)VARCHAR(512) (or similar) should be sufficient.  However, since you don\'t really know the maximum length of the URLs in question, I might just go direct to TEXT.  The danger with this is of course loss of efficiency due to CLOBs being far slower than a simple string datatype like VARCHAR.varchar(max) for SQLServer2005varchar(65535) for MySQL 5.0.3 and laterThis will allocate storage as need and shouldn\'t affect performance.You should use a VARCHAR with an ASCII character encoding. URLs are percent encoded and international domain names use punycode so ASCII is enough to store them. This will use much less space than UTF8.Most browsers will let you put very large amounts of data in a URL and thus lots of things end up creating very large URLs so if you are talking about anything more than the domain part of a URL you will need to use a TEXT column since the VARCHAR/CHAR are limited.You\'ll want to choose between a TEXT or VARCHAR column based on how often the URL will be used and whether you actually need the length to be unbound.Use VARCHAR with maxlength >= 2,083 as micahwittman suggested if:Use TEXT if :This really depends on your use case (see below), but storing as TEXT has performance issues, and a huge VARCHAR sounds like overkill for most cases.My approach: use a generous, but not unreasonably large VARCHAR length, such as VARCHAR(500) or so, and encourage the users who need a larger URL to use a URL shortener such as safe.mn. The Twitter approach: For a really nice UX, provide an automatic URL shortener for overly-long URL\'s and store the "display version" of the link as a snippet of the URL with ellipses at the end. (Example: http://stackoverflow.com/q/219569/1235702 would be displayed as stackoverflow.com/q/21956... and would link to a shortened URL http://ex.ampl/e1234)Notes and CaveatsI don\'t know about other browsers, but IE7 has a 2083 character limit for HTTP GET operations. Unless any other browsers have lower limits, I don\'t see why you\'d need any more characters than 2083.You better use varchar(max) which (in terms of size) means varchar (65535).\nThis will even store your bigger web addresses and will save your space as well.The max specifier expands the storage capabilities of the varchar,\n  nvarchar, and varbinary data types. varchar(max), nvarchar(max), and\n  varbinary(max) are collectively called large-value data types. You can\n  use the large-value data types to store up to 2^31-1 bytes of data.See this article on TechNet about using Using Large-Value Data TypesMost web servers have a URL length limit (which is why there is an error code for "URI too long"), meaning there is a practical upper size. Find the default length limit for the most popular web servers, and use the largest of them as the field\'s maximum size; it should be more than enough.
