Java has some very good open source static analysis tools such as FindBugs, Checkstyle and PMD.  Those tools are easy to use, very helpful, runs on multiple operating systems and free.Commercial C++ static analysis products are available from vendors Klocwork, Gimpel and Coverity. Also there is less-known PVS-Studio analyzer. Although having such products are great, the cost is just way too much for students and it is usually rather hard to get trial version.The alternative is to find open source C++ static analysis tools that will run on multiple platforms (Windows and Unix). By using an open source tool, it could be modified to fit certain needs.  Finding the tools has not been easy task.Below is a short list of C++ static analysis tools that were found or suggested by others.  What are some other portable open source C++ static analysis tools that anyone knows of and can be recommended?Some related links.Oink is a tool built on top of the Elsa C++ front-end.  Mozilla\'s Pork is a fork of Elsa/Oink.See: http://danielwilkerson.com/oink/index.htmlCppCheck is open source and cross-platform.Mac OSX:Concerning the GNU compiler, gcc has already a builtin option that enables additional warning to those of -Wall. The option is -Weffc++ and it\'s about the violations of some guidelines of Scott Meyers published in his books "Effective and More Effective C++".In particular the option detects the following items:Under development for now, but clang does C analysis and is targeted to handle C++ over time. It\'s part of the LLVM project.Update: While the landing page says "The analyzer is a continuous work-in-progress", it is nevertheless now documented as a static analyzer for both C and C++.Question: How can I run GCC/Clang for static analysis? (warnings only)Compiler option: -fsyntax-onlySomeone else mentioned -Weffc++, but that is actually one of the only GCC warnings I do not turn on by default. However, the set of warnings that I do turn on is the most important static analysis tool in my kit. You can see the complete list of recommended warnings.In summary: -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -Wcast-align -Wcast-qual -Wctor-dtor-privacy -Wdisabled-optimization -Wformat=2 -Winit-self -Wlogical-op -Wmissing-declarations -Wmissing-include-dirs -Wnoexcept -Wold-style-cast -Woverloaded-virtual -Wredundant-decls -Wshadow -Wsign-conversion -Wsign-promo -Wstrict-null-sentinel -Wstrict-overflow=5 -Wswitch-default -Wundef -Werror -Wno-unusedNote that some of these require a new version of gcc, so you may need to eliminate them from your list if you are stuck back on 4.5 or something.John Carmack also mentions PVS-Studio in this interesting blog post on "Static Code Analysis".If by Open Source, you really meant "free", then Microsoft\'s prefast analysis is a good one. Windows-only ofcourse. It is fully integrated in Visual Studio & the compiler. e.g.:cl /analyze Sample.cpp Mozilla\'s static analysis work is probably worth a look.Splint seems to fill the bill for C.If you didn\'t specify open source I\'d say Gimpel Software\'s PCLint is probably one of the best tools available for static code checking in C++.  But, of course, it\'s not open source.  Mac OSX: Microsoft\'s PREFast is also available in the Windows Driver Kit.  Version 7.0 is downloadable here.The Microsoft docs state that it should only be run against driver code but this (old) blog post lays out steps to run it.  Perhaps it can be integrated into a normal build process?We have been working on an Eclipse CDT plug-in called metriculator. Its still under development but some major metrics (e.g. LSLOC, McCabe, EfferentCoupling) are already implemented.See http://sinv-56013.edu.hsr.ch/redmine/projects/metricular/wiki/Documentation for more details like video demonstration and documentation.The latest nightly build is available for installation via update site at: http://sinv-56013.edu.hsr.ch/metriculator/updatesite-nightly/site/Further DescriptionMetriculator statically analysis C++ source code and generates software metrics. Metrics are implemented as\nCodan checkers. The analysis results can be explored in a separate view. Each\nmetric has configurable properties (e.g. a threshold for \'max lines of code per\nfunction\'). Exceeding these threshold will report a problem and create a marker\nin the source code editor.with metriculator you can:Currently metriculator comes with the following metrics:You should try oo-browser it has awesome integration with xemacsOne can also code extensions of GCC in MELT (a domain specific language designed for extending GCC) or GCC plugins in C (much harder) to do some custom analysis.Doxygen does some control flow analysis and generates graphs. Those may not be what you\'re looking for, but I\'ve foudn them useful to look at.
