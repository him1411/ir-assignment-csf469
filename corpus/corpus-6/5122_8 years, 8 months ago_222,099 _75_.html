Consider I have the following text in a UILabel (a long line of dynamic text):Since the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. I want to resize the UILabel\'s height so that the text can fit in. I\'m using following properties of UILabel to make the text within to wrap.Please let me know if I\'m not heading in the right direction. Thanks.sizeWithFont constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode: is the method to use. An example of how to use it is below:You were going in the right direction. All you need to do is:In iOS 6 Apple has added a property to UILabel that greatly simplifies dynamic vertical resizing of labels: preferredMaxLayoutWidth.Using this property in combination with lineBreakMode = NSLineBreakByWordWrapping and sizeToFit method allows easily resize a UILabel instance to the height that accommodates the entire text.A quote from iOS documentation:A sample:Instead doing this programmatically, you can do this in Storyboard/XIB while designing.Check this work perfectly without adding Single line of code. (Using Autolayout)I made a demo for you according to your requirement. Download it from below link,Autoresize UIView and UILabelStep by Step Guide :-Step 1 :- Set constrain to UIView 1) Leading 2) Top 3) Trailing (From mainview)Step 2 :- Set constrain to Label 11) Leading 2) Top 3) Trailing (From it\'s superview)Step 3 :- Set constrain to Label 21) Leading 2) Trailing (From it\'s superview)Step 4 :- Most tricky give botton to UILabel from UIView .Step 5 :- (Optional) Set constrain to UIButton1) Leading 2) Bottom 3) Trailing 4) Fixed Height (From mainview)Output :-Note :- Make sure you have set Number of lines =0 in Label property.I hope this info enough to understand Autoresize UIView according to UILabel\'s height and Autoresize UILabel According to text.Thanks guys for help, here is the code I tried which is working for meSolution to iOS7 prior and iOS7 aboveSince sizeWithFont is deprecated I use this one instead.this one get label specific attributes.Here is a category version:UILabel+AutoSize.h\n    #import UILabel+AutoSize.mYou can implement TableViewController\'s (UITableViewCell *)tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath   method in the following way (for example) :Also use NSString\'s sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode: method to compute the text\'s height.The easiest and better way that worked for me was to apply height constraint to label and set the priority to low, i.e., (250) in storyboard.So you need not worry about calculating the height and width programmatically, thanks to storyboard.And for those that are migrating to iOS 8, here is a class extension for Swift:Updated MethodThis is one line of code to get the UILabel Height using Objective-c:and using .height you will get the height of label as follows:Thanks for this post. It helped me a great deal. In my case I am also editing the text in a separate view controller. I noticed that when I use:in the tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath: method that the label view was continually rendered over the top of the previous view each time I edited the cell. The text became pixelated, and when something was deleted or changed, the previous version was visible under the new version. Here\'s how I solved the problem:No more weird layering. If there is a better way to handle this, Please let me know.use this here all the properties are used on the label and test it by increasing the text in the itemTitle.text asit will show the perfetc answer as you need You may use it as a method, as well.  @Pyjamasam is very much true so i am just making its method.  It may be helpfull for some one elseand just set it like thisSwift 2:The interesting lines are sizeToFit() in conjunction with setting a frame.size.height to the max float, this will give room for long text, but sizeToFit() will force it to only use the necessary, but ALWAYS call it after setting the .frame.size.height .I recommend setting a .backgroundColor for debug purposes, this way you can see the frame being rendered for each case.One line is Chris\'s answer is wrong.should beOther than that, it\'s the correct solution.Finally, it worked. Thank you guys.I was not getting it to work because i was trying to resize the label in heightForRowAtIndexPath method:and (yeah silly me), i was resizing the label to default in cellForRowAtIndexPath method - i was overlooking the code i had written earlier: My code: This method will give perfect  height Please set constraints for UILable in storyboard including top left bottom rightTo do this in Swift3 following is the code:When autoLayout is enabled the resizing doesn\'t work :)Problem is that none of mentioned functions is realiable and for some string and font will return incorrect height value. Especially will fail for attributed texts.The only realiable solution is here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/4214978/699944 and the point is to use CoreText to manually calculate height of every line to get right size. There is no other known way to do this.This method will work for both iOS 6 and 7My approach to compute the dynamic height of UILabel.Wrap to function:
