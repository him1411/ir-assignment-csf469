lets say we have a custom class named imageFile and this class contains two properties. lots of them stored in Arrayquestion is: how can i sort images array by \'fileID\' ASC or DESC?First, declare your Array as a typed array so that you can call methods when you iterate:Then you can simply do:The example above gives desc sort order[Updated for Swift 3 with sort(by:)] This, exploiting a trailing closure:where you use < or > depending on ASC or DESC, respectively.  If you want to modify the images array, then use the following:If you are going to do this repeatedly and prefer to define a function, one way is:and then use as:Nearly everyone gives how directly, let me show the evolvement:you can use the instance methods of Array:For elaborate explanation about the working principle of sort, see The Sorted Function.Swift 3In Swift 3.0Two alternatives1) Ordering the original array with sortInPlace2) Using an alternative array to store the ordered arrayYou can also do something likeso your images array will be stored as sortedWith Swift 4, Array has two methods called sorted() and sorted(by:). The first method, sorted(), has the following declaration:Returns the elements of the collection, sorted.The second method, sorted(by:), has the following declaration:Returns the elements of the collection, sorted using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.If the element type inside your collection conforms to Comparable protocol, you will be able to use sorted() in order to sort your elements with ascending order. The following Playground code shows how to use sorted():If the element type inside your collection conforms to Comparable protocol, you will have to use sorted(by:) in order to sort your elements with a descending order.If the element type inside your collection DOES NOT conform to Comparable protocol, you will have to use sorted(by:) in order to sort your elements with ascending or descending order.Note that Swift also provides two methods called sort() and sort(by:) as counterparts of sorted() and sorted(by:) if you need to sort your collection in-place.If you are going to be sorting this array in more than one place, it may make sense to make your array type Comparable.If you are not using custom objects, but value types instead that implements Comparable protocol (Int, String etc..) you can simply do this:An example:If you want to sort original array of custom objects. Here is another way to do so in Swift 2.1Where id is an Integer. You can use the same < operator for String properties as well.You can learn more about its use by looking at an example here:\nSwift2: Nearby Customers
