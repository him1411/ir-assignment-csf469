Is there any way to determine the category of screen size of the current device, such as small, normal, large, xlarge?Not the density, but the screen size.You can use the Configuration.screenLayout bitmask.Example:The code below fleshes out the answer above, displaying the screen size as a Toast.This code below displays the screen density as a Toast.Jeff Gilfelt\'s answer as a static helper method:Thanks for the answers above, that helped me a lot :-) But for those (like me) forced to still support Android 1.5 we can use java reflection for backward compatible:If you want to easily know the screen density and size of an Android device, you can use this free app (no permission required):\nhttps://market.android.com/details?id=com.jotabout.screeninfoNeed to check for xlarge screens & x..high densities? This is the altered code from the chosen answer.Here is a Xamarin.Android version of Tom McFarlin\'s answer Copy and paste this code into your Activity and when it is executed it will Toast the device\'s screen size category.Couldn\'t you do this using a string resource and enums? You can define a string resource that had the name of the screen size, such as SMALL, MEDIUM, or LARGE. Then you could use the value of the string resource to create an instance of the enum. Define an Enum in your code for the different screen sizes you care about.  Define a string resource, say screensize, whose value will be either SMALL, MEDIUM, or LARGE.
