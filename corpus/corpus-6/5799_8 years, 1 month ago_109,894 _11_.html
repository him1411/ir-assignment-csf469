Assuming I am the maintainer of a repo, and I want to pull in changes from a contributor, there are a few possible workflows:In both cases 2 and 3, git records the branch history of the commits, unlike 1.What are the pro\'s and con\'s between using either cherry-pick or merge methods described? My understanding is that method 2 is the norm, but I feel that resolving a large commit with a single "conflict" merge, is not the cleanest solution. Both rebase (and cherry-pick) and merge have their advantages and disadvantages.  I argue for merge here, but it\'s worth understanding both.  (Look here for an alternate, well-argued answer enumerating cases where rebase is preferred.)merge is preferred over cherry-pick and rebase for a couple of reasons.Even with a merge-heavy workflow rebase and cherry-pick are still useful for particular cases:As for preferring merging many changes over one: it\'s just a lot simpler.  It can get very tedious to do merges of individual changesets once you start having a lot of them.  The merge resolution in git (and in Mercurial, and in Bazaar) is very very good.  You won\'t run into major problems merging even long branches most of the time.  I generally merge everything all at once and only if I get a large number of conflicts do I back up and re-run the merge piecemeal.  Even then I do it in large chunks.  As a very real example I had a colleague who had 3 months worth of changes to merge, and got some 9000 conflicts in 250000 line code-base.  What we did to fix is do the merge one month\'s worth at a time: conflicts do not build up linearly, and doing it in pieces results in far fewer than 9000 conflicts.  It was still a lot of work, but not as much as trying to do it one commit at a time.In my opinion cherry-picking should be reserved for rare situations where it is required, for example if you did some fix on directly on \'master\' branch (trunk, main development branch) and then realized that it should be applied also to \'maint\'.  You should base workflow either on merge, or on rebase (or "git pull --rebase").  Please remember that cherry-picked or rebased commit is different from the point of view of Git (has different SHA-1 identifier) than the original, so it is different than the commit in remote repository.  (Rebase can usually deal with this, as it checks patch id i.e. the changes, not a commit id).Also in git you can merge many branches at once: so called octopus merge.  Note that octopus merge has to succeed without conflicts.  Nevertheless it might be useful.HTH.
