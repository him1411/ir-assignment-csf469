While reading up the documentation for dict.copy(), it says that it makes a shallow copy of the dictionary. Same goes for the book I am following (Beazley\'s Python Reference), which says: The m.copy() method makes a shallow\n  copy of the items contained in a\n  mapping object and places them in a\n  new mapping object.Consider this:So I assumed this would update the value of original (and add \'c\': 3) also since I was doing a shallow copy. Like if you do it for a list:This works as expected.Since both are shallow copies, why is that the dict.copy() doesn\'t work as I expect it to? Or my understanding of shallow vs deep copying is flawed?By "shallow copying" it means the content of the dictionary is not copied by value, but just creating a new reference.In contrast, a deep copy will copy all contents by value.So:b = a: Reference assignment, Make a and b points to the same object.b = a.copy(): Shallow copying, a and b will become two isolated objects, but their contents still share the same referenceb = copy.deepcopy(a): Deep copying, a and b\'s structure and content become completely isolated.It\'s not a matter of deep copy or shallow copy, none of what you\'re doing is deep copy.Here:you\'re creating a new reference to the the list/dict referenced by original.while here:you\'re creating a new list/dict which is filled with a copy of the references of objects contained in the original container.Take this example:Now let\'s change a value in the \'shallow\' (first) level:Now let\'s change a value one level deeper:"new" and "original" are different dicts, that\'s why you can update just one of them.. The items are shallow-copied, not the dict itself.Adding to kennytm\'s answer. When you do a shallow copy parent.copy() a new dictionary is created with same keys. Values are not copied they are referenced.If you add a new value to parent_copy it won\'t effect parent because parent_copy is a new dictionary not reference.The hash(id) value of parent[1], parent_copy[1] are identical which implies  [1,2,3] of parent[1] and parent_copy[1] stored at id 140690938288400.But hash of parent and parent_copy are different which implies \nThey are different dictionaries and parent_copy is a new dictionary having values reference to values of parentContents are shallow copied.So if the original dict contains a list or another dictionary, modifying one them in the original or its shallow copy will modify them (the list or the dict) in the other.
