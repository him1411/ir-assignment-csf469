I have a classI want to make a typedef which creates a Vector (column vector) which is equivalent to a Matrix with sizes N and 1. Something like that:Which produces compile error. The following creates something similar, but not exactly what I want:Is there a solution or a not too expensive workaround / best-practice for it? C++11 added alias declarations, which are generalization of typedef, allowing templates:The type Vector<3> is equivalent to Matrix<3, 1>.In C++03, the closest approximation was:Here, the type Vector<3>::type is equivalent to Matrix<3, 1>.
