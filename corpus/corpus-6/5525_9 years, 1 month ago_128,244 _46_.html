I am currently developing a .NET application, which consists of 20 projects. Some of those projects are compiled using .NET 3.5, some others are still .NET 2.0 projects (so far no problem).The problem is that if I include an external component I always get the following warning:What exactly does this warning mean and is there maybe a possibility to exclude this warning (like using #pragma disable in the source- code files)?This warning means that two projects reference the same assembly (e.g. System.Windows.Forms) but the two projects require different versions. You have a few options:Recompile all projects to use the same versions (e.g. move all to .Net 3.5). This is the preferred option because all code is running with the versions of dependencies they were compiled with.Add a binding redirect. This will suppress the warning. However, your .Net 2.0 projects will (at runtime) be bound to the .Net 3.5 versions of dependent assemblies such as System.Windows.Forms. You can quickly add a binding redirect by double-clicking on error in Visual Studio.Use CopyLocal=true. I\'m not sure if this will suppress the warning. It will, like option 2 above, mean that all projects will use the .Net 3.5 version of System.Windows.Forms.Here is a utility to identify the offending reference(s):https://gist.github.com/1553265Basically this happens when the assemblies you\'re referencing have "Copy Local" set to "True", meaning that a copy of the DLL is placed in the bin folder along with your exe.Since Visual Studio will copy all of the dependencies of a referenced assembly as well, it\'s possible to end up with two different builds of the same assembly being referred to. This is more likely to happen if your projects are in separate solutions, and can therefore be compiled separately.The way I\'ve gotten around it is to set Copy Local to False for references in assembly projects. Only do it for executables/web applications where you need the assembly for the finished product to run.Hope that makes sense!I had the same problem with one of my projects, however, none of the above helped to solve the warning. I checked the detailed build logfile, I used AsmSpy to verify that I used the correct versions for each project in the affected solution, I double checked the actual entries in each project file - nothing helped.Eventually it turned out that the problem was a nested dependency of one of the references I had in one project. This reference (A) in turn required a different version of (B) which was referenced directly from all other projects in my solution. Updating the reference in the referenced project solved it.I hope the above shows what I mean, took my a couple of hours to find out, so hopefully someone else will benefit as well.I wanted to post pauloya\'s solution they provided in the comments above.  I believe it is the best solution for finding the offending references.The simplest way to find what are the "offending reference(s)" is to\n  set Build output verbosity (Tools, Options, Projects and Solutions,\n  Build and Run, MSBuild project build output verbosity, Detailed) and\n  after building, search the output window for the warning. See the text\n  just above it.For example, when you search the output panel for "conflict" you may find something like this:As you can see, there is a conflict between EF versions 5 and 6.I just had this warning message and cleaned the solution and recompiled (Build -> Clean Solution) and it went away.I had the same issue and I resolved by changing the following in web.config.It happened to me because I am running the application using Newtonsoft.Json 4.0 From:To:On Visual Studio if you right click on the solution and Manage nuget packages theres a "Consolidate" tab which sets all the packages to the same version.This actually depends on your external component. When you reference an external component in a .NET application it generates a GUID to identify that component. This error occurs when the external component referenced by one of your projects has the same name and but different version as another such component in another assembly.This sometimes happens when you use "Browse" to find references and add the wrong version of the assembly, or you have a different version of the component in your code repository as the one you installed in the local machine.Do try to find which projects have these conflicts, remove the components from the reference list, then add them again making sure that you\'re pointing to the same file.I have another way to do this if you\'re using Nuget to manage your dependencies. I\'ve discovered that sometimes VS and Nuget don\'t match up and Nuget is unable to recognize that your projects are out of sync. The packages.config will say one thing but the path shown in References - Properties will indicate something else.  If you\'re willing to update your dependencies, do the following:From Solution Explorer, right click the Project and click \'Manage\nNuget Packages\'Select \'Installed packages\' tab in left pane Record your installed\n    packages     You may want to copy your packages.config to your\n    desktop first if you have a lot, so you can cross check it with\n    Google to see what Nuget pkgs are installedUninstall your packages. Its OK, we\'re going to add them right back.Immediately install the packages you need. What Nuget will do is not only get you the latest version, but will alter your references, and also add the binding redirects for you.Do this for all of your projects.At the solution level, do a Clean and Rebuild.You may want to start with the lower projects and work your way to the higher level ones, and rebuild each project as you go along.If you don\'t want to update your dependencies, then you can use the package manager console, and use the syntax Update-Package -ProjectName [yourProjectName] [packageName] -Version [versionNumber]=> check there will be some instance of application installed partially. => first of all uninstall that instance from uninstall application.=> then,clean,Rebuild,and try to deploy.this solved my issue.hope it helps you too.\nBest Regards.This happened to me too. One dll was referenced twice: once directly (in references) and once indirectly (referenced by another referenced project). \nI removed direct reference, cleaned & rebuilt solution. Problem fixed.In my case, there was a problem with MySQL reference. Somehow, I could list three versions of it under the list of all available references; for .net 2.0, .net 4.0 and .net 4.5. I followed process 1 through 6 above and it worked for me.Also had this problem - in my case it was caused by having the "Specific Version" property on a number of references set to true. Changing this to false on those references resolved the issue.
