Is there a really easy way to start from a full URL:And extract just the host part:There\'s gotta be a JavaScript function that does this reliably, but I can\'t find it.suppose that you have a page with this address: http://sub.domain.com/virtualPath/page.htm. use the following in page code to achive those results:Update: about the .origin***** As the ref states, browser compatibility for window.location.origin is not clear. I\'ve checked it in chrome and it returned http://sub.domain.com:port if the port is anything but 80, and http://sub.domain.com if the port is 80.Special thanks to @torazaburo for mentioning that to me.You could concatenate the location protocol and the host:For a url, let say \'http://stackoverflow.com/questions\', it will return \'http://stackoverflow.com\'Use document.location object and its host or hostname properties.There are two ways. The first is a variant of another answer here, but this one accounts for non-default ports:But I prefer this simpler method (which works with any URI string):Tryoruse window.location.originand for: "http://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd.com/sadf.aspx?blah"you will get: http://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd.com/There is another hack I use and never saw in any StackOverflow response :\nusing "src" attribute of an image will yield the complete base path of your site.\nFor instance :On an URL like http://domain.com/somesite/index.html,\nroot will be set to http://domain.com/somesite/.\nThis also works for localhost or any valid base URL.Note that this will cause a failed HTTP request on the $ dummy image.\nYou can use an existing image instead to avoid this, with only slight code changes.Another variant uses a dummy link, with no side effect on HTTP requests :I did not test it on every browser, though.The accepted answer didn\'t work for me since wanted to be able to work with any arbitary url\'s, not just the current page URL. Take a look at the URL object:Check this:this will return host name as www.domain.comand:will return domain name with port like www.example.com:80For complete reference check Mozilla developer site.I would like to specify something. If someone want to get the whole url with path like I need, can use:As Martin said, the other answers won\'t work with arbitrary urls. The new URL object will work but is still experimental and not compatible with all browsers.For a more reliable and cross browser solution, you can use this component I built to parse an arbitrary url into properties similar to those found in the above URL object.For example:newUrl will now contain:You can import the component to use parseUrl()
