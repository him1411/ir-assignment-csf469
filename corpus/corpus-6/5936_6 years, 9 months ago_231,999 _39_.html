What is the difference between the return and exit statement in BASH functions with respect to exit codes?return returns a value from a function. exit abandons the current shell.EDIT:As per your edit of the question, regarding exit codes, return has nothing to do with exit codes. Exit codes are intended for applications/scripts, not functions. So in this regard, the only keyword that sets the exit code of the script (the one that can be caught by the calling program using the $? shell variable) is exit.EDIT 2:My last statement referring exit is causing some comments. It was made to differentiate return and exit for the understanding of the OP, and in fact, at any given point of a program/shell script, exit is the only way of ending the script with an exit code to the calling process.Every command executed in the shell produces a local "exit code": it sets the $? variable to that code, and can be used with if,  && and other operators to conditionally execute other commands.These exit codes (and the value of the $? variable) are reset by each command execution.Incidentally, the exit code of the last command executed by the script is used as the exit code of the script itself as seen by the calling process. Finally, functions, when called, act as shell commands with respect to exit codes. The exit code of the function (within the function) is set by using return. So when in a function return 0 is run, the function execution terminates, giving an exit code of 0.return will cause the current function to go out of scope, while exit will cause the script to end at the point where it is called.  Here is a sample program to help explain this:I don\'t think anyone has really fully answered the question because they don\'t describe how the two are used.  OK I think we know that exit kills the script, where ever it is called and you can assign a status to it as well such as exit or exit 0  or exit 7 and so forth. This can be used to determine how the script was forced to stop if called by another script etc.  Enough on exit.return when called will return the value specified to indicate the function\'s behavior, usually a 1 or a 0. For example:check like this:or like this:In this example, the test can be used to indicate if the directory was found. notice that anything after the return will not be executed in the function.  0 is true but false is 1 in the shell, different from other prog langs.For more info on functions:\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/content/return-values-bash-functionsRemember, functions are internal to a script and normally return from whence they were  called by using the return statement.  Calling an external script is another matter entirely, and scripts usually terminate with an exit statement.The difference "between the return and exit statement in BASH functions with respect to exit codes" is very little.  Both return a status, not values per se.  A status of zero indicates success, while any other status (1 to 255) indicates a failure.  The return statement will return to the script from where it was called, while the exit statement will end the entire script from whereever it is encountered.If your function simply ends with no return statement, the status of the last command executed is returned as the status code (and will be placed in $?).Remember, return and exit give back a status code from 0 to 255, available in $?.  You cannot stuff anything else into a status code (e.g. return "cat"); it will not work.  But, a script can pass back 255 different reasons for failure by using status codes.You can set variables contained in the calling script, or echo results in the function and use command substitution in the calling script; but the purpose of return and exit are to pass status codes, not values or computation results as one might expect in a programming language like C.Sometimes, you run a script using . or source.If you include an exit in the a.sh, it will not just terminate the script, but end your shell session.If you include a return in the a.sh, it simply stops processing the script.In simple words (mainly for newbie in coding), we can say,Also If you observed, this is very basic but...,First of all, return is a keyword and exit my friend is a function.That said, here\'s a simplest of explanations.return \nIt returns a value from a function. exit\nIt exits out of or abandons the current shell.exit terminate the current process; with or without exit code, consider this a system more than a program function. Note that when sourcing, exit will end the shell, however, when running will just exit the script.return from a function go back to the instruction after the call,\nwith or without a return code. return is optional and it\'s implicit\nat the end of the function. return can only be used inside a function.I want to add that while being sourced, it\'s not easy to exit the script from within a function without killing the shell. I think, an example is better on a \'test\' scriptdoing the following:test -and- the shell will close.only test will finish and the prompt will show.The solution is to enclose the potentially procedure in ( and )now, in both case only test will exit.
