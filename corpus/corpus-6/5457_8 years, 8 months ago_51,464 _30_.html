While I like to think of myself as a reasonably competent Python coder, one aspect of the language I\'ve never been able to grok is decorators.I know what they are (superficially), I\'ve read tutorials, examples, questions on Stack Overflow, and I understand the syntax, can write my own, occasionally use @classmethod and @staticmethod, but it never occurs to me to use a decorator to solve a problem in my own Python code.  I never encounter a problem where I think, "Hmm...this looks like a job for a decorator!"So, I\'m wondering if you guys might offer some examples of where you\'ve used decorators in your own programs, and hopefully I\'ll have an "A-ha!" moment and get them.I use decorators mainly for timing purposesI\'ve used them for synchronization.As pointed out in the comments, since Python 2.5 you can use a with statement in conjunction with a  threading.Lock (or multiprocessing.Lock since version 2.6) object to simplify the decorator\'s implementation to just:Regardless, you then use it like this:Basically it just puts lock.acquire() / lock.release() on either side of the function call.I use decorators for type checking parameters which are passed to my Python methods via some RMI. So instead of repeating the same parameter counting, exception-raising mumbo-jumbo again and againI just declareand accepts() does all the work for me.Decorators are used for anything that you want to transparently "wrap" with additional functionality.Django uses them for wrapping "login required" functionality on view functions, as well as for registering filter functions.You can use class decorators for adding named logs to classes.Any sufficiently generic functionality that you can "tack on" to an existing class or function\'s behavior is fair game for decoration.There\'s also a discussion of use cases on the Python-Dev newsgroup pointed to by PEP 318 -- Decorators for Functions and Methods.The Twisted library uses decorators combined with generators to give the illusion that an asynchronous function is synchronous.  For example:Using this, code that would have been broken up into a ton of little callback functions can be written quite naturally as a single block, making it a lot easier to understand and maintain.For nosetests, you can write a decorator that supplies a unit test function or method with several sets of parameters:There are a number of suggested usages and snippets at the Python wiki.I use them mainly for debugging (wrapper around a function that prints its arguments and result) and verification (e.g. to check if an argument is of correct type or, in the case of web application, if the user has sufficient privileges to call a particular method).I\'ve actually recently had one of those "A-ha!" moments, as you call them, and used a decorator to enable me to profile decorated functions/methods only. It\'s the profile_func decorator in this file, the output of which can be viewed in KCacheGrind. Very useful indeed.One obvious use is for logging, of course:Decorators are used either to define a function\'s properties or as boilerplate that alters it; it\'s possible but counter-intuitive for them to return completely different functions.  Looking at the other responses here, it seems like one of the most common uses is to limit the scope of some other process - be it logging, profiling, security checks, etc.CherryPy uses object-dispatching to match URLs to objects and, eventually, methods.  Decorators on those methods signal whether or not CherryPy is even allowed to use those methods.  For example, adapted from the tutorial:I am using the following decorator for making a function threadsafe. It makes the code more readable. It is almost similar to the one proposed by John Fouhy but the difference is that one work on a single function and that there is no need to create a lock object explicitely. I used them recently, while working on social networking web application. For Community/Groups, I was supposed to give membership authorization to create new discussion and reply to a message you have to be the member of that particular group. So, I wrote a decorator @membership_required and put that where I required in my view.I use this decorator to fix parameterthis written when I refactor some functions need to passed argument "wanN" but in my old codes, I passed N or \'N\' onlyDecorator can be used to easily create function method variables.
