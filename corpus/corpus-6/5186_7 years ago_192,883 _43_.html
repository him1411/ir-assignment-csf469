How can I get the year/month/day of a NSDate object, given no other information? I realize that I could probably do this with something similar to this:But that seems to be a whole lot of hassle for something as simple as getting a NSDate\'s year/month/day. Is there any other solution?Because this is apparently my most popular answer, I\'ll try to edit it to contain a little bit more information.Despite its name, NSDate in and of itself simply marks a point in machine time, not a date. There\'s no correlation between the point in time specified by an NSDate and a year, month, or day. For that, you have to refer to a calendar. Any given point in time will return different date information based on what calendar you\'re looking at (dates are not the same in both the Gregorian and Jewish calendars, for instance), and while the Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world - I\'m assuming - we\'re a little biased that NSDate should always use it. NSDate, luckily, is far more bipartisan.Getting date and time is going to have to pass through NSCalendar, as you mentioned, but there\'s a simpler way to do it:That generates an NSDateComponents object containing the day, month, and year from the current system calendar for the current day. (Note: this isn\'t necessarily the current user-specified calendar, just the default system one.)Of course, if you\'re using a different calendar or date, you can easily change that. A list of  available calendars and calendar units can be found in the NSCalendar Class Reference. More information about NSDateComponents can be found in the NSDateComponents Class Reference.For reference, accessing individual components from the NSDateComponents is rather easy:You just have to be mindful: NSDateComponents won\'t contain valid information for any fields you ask for unless you generated them with that valid information (i.e. request NSCalendar to provide that information with NSCalendarUnits). NSDateComponents contain no reference information in and of themselves - they\'re just simple structures that hold numbers for you to access. If you want to also get an era, for instance, out of NSDateComponents, you\'ll have to feed the generator method from NSCalendar with the NSCalendarUnitEra flag.You can get separate component of a NSDate using NSDateFormatter:If you wish to get month\'s number instead of abbreviation, use "MM". If you wish to get integers, use [myDayString intValue];Just to reword Itai\'s excellent (and working!) code, here\'s what a sample helper class would look like, to return the year value of a given NSDate variable.As you can see, it\'s easy enough to modify this code to get the month or day. (I can\'t believe we\'re having to write our own basic iOS date functions like this, in 2013...)One other thing:  don\'t ever use < and > to compare two NSDate values.XCode will happily accept such code (without any errors or warnings), but its results are a lottery.  You must use the "compare" function to compare NSDates:In Swift 2.0:I\'m writing this answer because it\'s the only approach that doesn\'t give you optionals back from NSDateComponent variables and/or force unwrapping those variables (also for Swift 3).Swift 3Swift 2Bonus Swift 3 fun versionObjCSwiftIf you are targeting iOS 8+ you can use the new NSCalendar convenience methods to achieve this in a more terse format.First create an NSCalendar and use whatever NSDate is required.You could extract components individually via component:fromDate:Or, even more succinctly, use NSInteger pointers via getEra:year:month:day:fromDate:For more information and examples check out NSDate Manipulation Made Easy in iOS 8. Disclaimer, I wrote the post.If you wish to get the individual NSDateComponents from NSDate, you would definitely need the solution suggested by Itai Ferber. But if you want to go from NSDate directly to an NSString, you can use NSDateFormatter.   Here\'s the solution in Swift:As of iOS 8.0 (and OS X 10) you can use the component method to simplify getting a single date component like so:Should make things simpler and hopefully this is implemented efficiently.Try the following:Swift 2.xYou can use it as OutputTry this . . .Code snippet:It gives current year, month, datei do in this way ....
