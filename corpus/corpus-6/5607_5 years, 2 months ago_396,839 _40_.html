I tried to close the tomcat using ./shutdown.sh from tomcat /bin directory. But found that the server was not closed properly. And thus I was unable to restartMy tomcat is running on port 8080.I want to kill the tomcat process running on 8080. I first want to have the list of processes running on a specific port (8080) in order to select which process to kill.This fuser 8080/tcp will print you PID of process bound on that port.And this fuser -k 8080/tcp will kill that process.Works on Linux only. More universal is use of lsof -i4 (or 6 for IPv6). To list any process listening to the port 8080:To kill any process listening to the port 8080:or more violently:Use the commandused grep java as tomcat uses java as their processes.It will show the list of processes with port number and process idthe number before /java is a process id. Now use kill command to kill the process-9 implies the process will be killed forcefully.You can use the lsof command.\nLet port number like here is 8090This command returns a list of open processes on this port.Something like\xe2\x80\xa6To free the port, kill the process using it(the process id is 75782)\xe2\x80\xa6This one worked for me.\nhere is the link from the original post: linkI would add this one-liner for only LISTEN on specific port:kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN)This prints to stdout the process ids of everything running on <port_number>:    It also prints some stuff to stderr, so:We can then supply these process ids to the kill command:You could also put this in a function if you do it a lot:To know the pid of service running on particular port :you will get the description of that process. Now use kill or kill -9 pid. Easily killed.e.gnetstat -ap | grep :8080Now:Remember to run all commands as roottry like this,lsof -i tcp:8000\nThis command lists the information about process running in port 8000kill -9 [PID]\nThis command kills the processLinux: You can use this command if you know the port :AIX: You then take the first column (example: f100050000b05bb8) and run the following command:kill process.kill -9 `fuser 8080/tcp|xargs -n 1`, this commands also kills the process that listens on port 8080 with TCP connectionIn Windows, it will be netstat -ano | grep "8080" and we get the following message TCP    0.0.0.0:8080           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       10076WE can kill the PID using  taskkill /F /PID 10076
