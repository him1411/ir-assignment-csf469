In iOS 7 Apple added a new default navigation behavior. You can swipe from the left edge of the screen to go back on the navigation stack. But in my app, this behavior conflicts with my custom left menu. So, is it possible to disable this new gesture in UINavigationController?I found a solution:  Objective-C: Swift 3:\nself.navigationController?.interactivePopGestureRecognizer?.isEnabled = falseI found out setting the gesture to disabled only doesn\'t always work. It does work, but for me it only did after I once used the backgesture. Second time it wouldn\'t trigger the backgesture.Fix for me was to delegate the gesture and implement the shouldbegin method to return NO:Just remove gesture recognizer from NavigationController. Work in iOS 8.As of iOS 8 the accepted answer no longer works.  I needed to stop the swipping to dismiss gesture on my main game screen so implemented this:I\'ve refined Twan\'s answer a bit, because:The following example assumes iOS 7:If you want to manage swipe back feature for specific navigation controllers, consider using SwipeBack.With this, you can set navigationController.swipeBackEnabled = NO.For example:It can be installed via CocoaPods.I appologize for lack of explanation.it works for me in ios 10 and later : it doesnt work on viewDidLoad() method.None of the given answers helped me to resolve the issue. Posting my answer here; may be helpful for someoneDeclare private var popGesture: UIGestureRecognizer? as global variable in your viewcontroller. Then implement the code in viewDidAppear and viewWillDisappear methodsThis will disable swipe back in iOS v8.x onwards This works in viewDidLoad: for iOS 8:Lots of the problems could be solved with help of the good ol\' dispatch_after.Though please note that this solution is potentially unsafe, please use your own reasoning.For iOS 8.1 delay time should be 0.5 seconds On iOS 9.3 no delay needed anymore, it works just by placing this in your viewDidLoad:\n(TBD if works on iOS 9.0-9.3)For Swift:This is the way on Swift 3works for meAll of these solutions manipulate Apple\'s gesture recognizer in a way they do not recommend. I\'ve just been told by a friend that there\'s a better solution:where myPanGestureRecognizer is the gesture recognizer you are using to e.g. show your menu. That way, Apple\'s gesture recognizer doesn\'t get turned back on by them when you push a new navigation controller and you don\'t need to rely on skanky delays that may fire too early if your phone is put to sleep or under heavy load.Leaving this here because I know I\'ll not remember this the next time I need it, and then I\'ll have the solution to the issue here.My method. One gesture recognizer to rule them all:Important: don\'t reset the delegate anywhere in the navigation stack: navigationController!.interactivePopGestureRecognizer!.delegate = nilPlease set this in root vc:
