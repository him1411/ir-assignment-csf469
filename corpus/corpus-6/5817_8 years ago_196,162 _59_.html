We currently offer JSON,\n  PHP, and XML formats.So getting this URL http://vimeo.com/api/v2/video/6271487.xmlParse this for every video to get the thumbnailHere\'s approximate code in PHPIn javascript (uses jQuery):To display it :Using jQuery jsonp request:You should parse Vimeo\'s API\'s response. There is no way to it with URL calls (like dailymotion or youtube).Here is my PHP solution:With Ruby, you can do the following if you have, say:Here is an example of how to do the same thing in ASP.NET using C#. Feel free to use a different error catch image :) NOTE: Your API request should like this when requested: http://vimeo.com/api/v2/video/32660708.xmlUsing the Vimeo url(https://player.vimeo.com/video/30572181), here is my exampleIf you would like to use thumbnail through pure js/jquery no api, you can use this tool to capture a frame from the video and voila! Insert url thumb in which ever source you like.Here is a code pen :http://codepen.io/alphalink/pen/epwZpJHere is the site to get thumbnail:http://video.depone.eu/The easiest JavaScript way that I found to get the thumbnail, without searching for the video id is using:Note: If someone need to get the video thumbnail related to the video id he can replace the $id with the video id and get an XML with the video details:Example: Source Actually the guy who asked that question posted his own answer."Vimeo seem to want me to make a HTTP request, and extract the thumbnail URL from the XML they return..."The Vimeo API docs are here: http://vimeo.com/api/docs/simple-apiIn short, your app needs to make a GET request to an URL like the following:and parse the returned data to get the thumbnail URL that you require, then download the file at that URL.I wrote a function in PHP to let me to this, I hope its useful to someone.  The path to the thumbnail is contained within a link tag on the video page.  This seems to do the trick for me.Hope it helps anyone.Foggson//at below function pass the thumbnail url.It seems like api/v2 is dead.\nIn order to use the new API, you need to register your application, and base64 encode the client_id and client_secret as an Authorization header.  For security, you can return the client_id and client_secret already encoded from the server.For somebody like me who\'s trying to figure this out recently,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/[video_id]_[dimension].webp works for me. (where dimension = 200x150 | 640)If you don\'t need an automated solution, you can find the thumbnail URL by entering the vimeo ID here: http://video.depone.eu/Decomposing Karthikeyan P\'s answer so it can be used in a wider array of scenarios:Get a Vimeo Id from a Vimeo video URL:Get a vimeo thumbnail URL from a Vimeo Id:https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/nm8L8cc8/1/If you are looking for an alternative solution and can manage the vimeo account there is another way, you simply add every video you want to show into an album and then use the API to request the album details - it then shows all the thumbnails and links. It\'s not ideal but might help.API end point (playground)Twitter convo with @vimeoapiYou might want to take a look at the gem from Matt Hooks.  https://github.com/matthooks/vimeoIt provides a simple vimeo wrapper for the api.  All you would need is to store the video_id (and the provider if you are also doing other video sites)You can extract the vimeo video id like soand if you need you tube you might find this usefull
