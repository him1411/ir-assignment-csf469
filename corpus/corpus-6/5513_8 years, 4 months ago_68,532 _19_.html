I\'m VERY confused as to why this coderesults in this link:The hidefocus part is what I was aiming to achieve, but where does the ?Length=4 come from?The Length=4 is coming from an attempt to serialize a string object. Your code is running this ActionLink method:This takes a string object "Home" for routeValues, which the MVC plumbing searches for public properties turning them into route values. In the case of a string object, the only public property is Length, and since there will be no routes defined with a Length parameter it appends the property name and value as a query string parameter. You\'ll probably find if you run this from a page not on HomeController it will throw an error about a missing About action method. Try using the following:The way I solved this is was adding a null to the fourth parameter before the anonymous declaration (new {}) so that it uses the following method overload: (linkText, actionName, controllerName, routeValues, htmlAttributes):You forgot to add the HTMLAttributes parm.This will work without any changes:The parameters to ActionLink are not correct, it\'s attempting to use the "Home" value as a route value, instead of the anonymous type.I believe you just need to add new { } or null as the last parameter.EDIT: Just re-read the post and realized you\'ll likely want to specify null as the second last parameter, not the last.This will take the overload: \nstring linkText, string actionName, string controllerName, Object routeValues, Object htmlAttributesKindly use right overloaded method with five (5) parameters. Example:Just remove "Home" (name of the controller) so that the code would be:As  Jonathon Watney pointed out in a comment, this also goes for Html.BeginForm()methods. In my case, I was in a Create.cshtml targeting the post request of the corresponding controller + Create action and hadwhich was adding the querystring "?Length=6" to the form action when rendered. Hinted by roryf\'s approved answer and realizing the string length of "Create" is 6, I finally solved this by removing the explicit action specification:With attribute names:
