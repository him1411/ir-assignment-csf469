I need to serve my app through my app server at 8080, and my static files from a directory without touching the app server. The nginx config I have is something like this...Now, with this config, everything is working fine. Note that the root directive is commented out.If I activate root and deactivate the alias -- it stops working. However, when I remove the trailing /static/ from the root it starts working again.Can someone explain what\'s going on. Also please explain clearly and verbosely what are the differences between root and alias, and their purposes.I have found answers to my confusions.There is a very important difference between the root and the alias directives. This difference exists in the way the path specified in the root or the alias is processed.In case of the root directive, full path is appended to the root including the location part, whereas in case of the alias directive, only the portion of the path NOT including the location part is appended to the alias.To illustrate:Let\'s say we have the configIn this case the final path that Nginx will derive will beThis is going to return 404 since there is no static/ within static/This is because the location part is appended to the path specified in the root. Hence, with root, the correct way isOn the other hand, with alias, the location part gets dropped. So for the configthe final path will correctly be formed asSee the documentation here: http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#aliasas say as @treecoder In case of the root directive, full path is appended to the root including the location part, whereas in case of the alias directive, only the portion of the path NOT including the location part is appended to the alias.A picture is worth a thousand wordsfor root:for alias:In your case, you can use root directive, because $uri part of the location directive is the same with last root directive part.Nginx documentation advices it as well:\n  When location matches the last part of the directive\xe2\x80\x99s value:location /images/ {\n      alias /data/w3/images/;\n  }\n  it is better to use the root directive instead:location /images/ {\n      root /data/w3;\n  }and root directive will append $uri to the path.Just a quick addendum to @good_computer\'s very helpful answer, I wanted to replace to root of the URL with a folder, but only if it matched a subfolder containing static files (which I wanted to retain as part of the path).For example if file requested is in /app/js or /app/css, look in /app/location/public/[that folder]. I got this to work using a regex.Server block to live the static page on nginx.
