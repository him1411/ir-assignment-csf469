I really hope someone can advise.I have 2 branches master | designWorking in design I did a stash and switched to master, made some adjustments. Switched back to design and did a stash apply only to lose all my changes in the design branch.I am hoping all my work is within a stash as I have not cleared or removed these.If I do a stash list I get 4 results:If I try git stash apply f2c0c72 I am getting an error:How can I apply a specific stash?Hope someone can help!!The keys into the stash are actually the stash@{n} items on the left. So try git stash apply stash@{0} etc. (note that in some shells you need to quote "stash@{0}", like zsh and fish).In fact stash@{0} is a revision in git that you can switch to... but git stash apply ... should figure out how to DTRT to apply it to your current location.To apply a stash and remove it from the stash list, run:To apply a stash and keep it in the stash cache, run:If one is on a Windows machine and in PowerShell, one needs to quote the argument such as:...or to apply the changes and remove from the stash:Otherwise without the quotes you might get this error:fatal: ambiguous argument \'stash@\': unknown revision or path not in\n  the working tree.Since the version 2.11, it\'s pretty easy, you can use the N stack number instead of saying "stash@{n}".\nSo now instead of use:You can type:For example, in your list:If you want to apply stash@{1} you could type:Otherwise, you can use it even if you have some changes in your directory since 1.7.5.1, but you must be sure the stash won\'t overwrite your working directory changes if it does you\'ll get an error:In earlier versions to 1.7.5.1, it refused to work if there was a change in the working directory.Git release notes:The user always has to say "stash@{$N}" when naming a single element\n  in the default location of the stash, i.e. reflogs in refs/stash.  The\n  "git stash" command learned to accept "git stash apply 4" as a\n  short-hand for "git stash apply stash@{4}"git stash apply" used to refuse to work if there was any change in the\n  working tree, even when the change did not overlap with the change the\n  stash recorded
