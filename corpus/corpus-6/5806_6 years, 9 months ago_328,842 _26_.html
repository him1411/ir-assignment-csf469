I\'ve tried all three of these to no avail:each are different values I found recommended by google searching or SO searching, but none of the \'user-scalable=X\' values seem to be workingI also tried comma delimiting the values instead of semicolon, no luck. Then I tried ONLY having the user-scalable value present, still no luck.UPDATEGot this from Apple\'s site and it works:it turns out that the problem was the non-standard quotes because I had copied the meta tag from a website that was using them, whoopsYour code is displaying attribute double quotes as fancy double quotes. If the fancy quotes are present in your actual source code I would guess that is the problem.This works for me on Mobile Safari in iOS 4.2.For the people looking for an iOS 10 solution, user-scaleable=no is disabled in Safari for iOS 10. The reason is that Apple is trying to improve accessibility by allowing people to zoom on web pages.From release notes:To improve accessibility on websites in Safari, users can now\n  pinch-to-zoom even when a website sets user-scalable=no in the\n  viewport.So as far as I understand, we are sh** out of luck.EDIT:\nCheck the answer by @jeremypress for a possible workaround :)@mattis is correct that iOS 10 Safari won\'t allow you to disable pinch to zoom with the user-scalable attribute. However, I got it to disable using preventDefault on the \'gesturestart\' event. I\'ve only verified this on Safari in iOS 10.0.2.for iphones safari up to iOS 10 "viewport" is not a solution, i don\'t like this way, but i have used this javascript code and it helped meTry adding the following to your head-tag:additionallyFinally, either as a style-attribute or in your css file, add the following text for webkit-based Browsers:In Safari 9.0 and up you can use shrink-to-fit in viewport meta tag as shown belowsometimes those other directives in content can mess up your view with Apple\'s best guess at how to layout your page, all you need to disable pinch zoom isThis no longer works on iOS 10. Apple removed the feature.There is no way yo can disable zoom website on iOS now, unless you make gross platform app.This works fine in IOS 10.3.2 thank you @arthur and @aleclarsonIn order to comply with WAI WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility requirements you must never disable pinch zoom.  (WCAG 2.0: SC 1.4.4 Resize text Level AA).
