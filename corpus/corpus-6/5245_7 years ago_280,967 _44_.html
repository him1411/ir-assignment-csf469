Something like:The solution should not contain try/catch. Some of us turn on "break on all errors" and they don\'t like the debugger breaking on those invalid JSON strings.A comment first. The question was about not using try/catch.\nIf you do not mind to use it, read the answer below.\nHere we just check a JSON string using a regexp, and it will work in most cases, not all cases.Have a look around the line 450 in https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.jsThere is a regexp that check for a valid JSON, something like:EDIT: The new version of json2.js makes a more advanced parsing than above, but still based on a regexp replace ( from the comment of @Mrchief )Use a JSON parser like JSON.parse:I know i\'m 3 years late to this question, but I felt like chiming in.While Gumbo\'s solution works great, it doesn\'t handle a few cases where no exception is raised for JSON.parse({something that isn\'t JSON})I also prefer to return the parsed JSON at the same time, so the calling code doesn\'t have to call JSON.parse(jsonString) a second time.This seems to work well for my needs:Usage: isJSON({}) will be false, isJSON(\'{}\') will be true.To check if something is an Array or Object (parsed JSON):Usage: isAO({}) will be true, isAO(\'{}\') will be false.in prototype js we have method isJSON. try that http://api.prototypejs.org/language/string/prototype/isjson/even http://www.prototypejs.org/learn/jsonYou can use the javascript eval() function to verify if it\'s valid.e.g.Alternatively, you can use JSON.parse function from json.org:Hope this helps.WARNING: eval() is dangerous if someone adds malicious JS code, since it will execute it. Make sure the JSON String is trustworthy, i.e. you got it from a trusted source.Edit For my 1st solution, it\'s recommended to do this.To guarantee json-ness. If the jsonString isn\'t pure JSON, the eval will throw an exception.I used a really simple method to check a string how it\'s a valid JSON or not.Result with a valid JSON string:Result with a simple string;This works everytime. :)From Prototype framework String.isJSON definition hereso this is the version that can be used passing a string objectThis answer to reduce the cost of trycatch statement.I used JQuery to parse JSON strings and I used trycatch statement to handle exceptions, but throwing exceptions for un-parsable strings slowed down my code, so I used simple Regex to check the string if it is a possible JSON string or not without going feather by checking it\'s syntax, then I used the regular way by parsing the string using JQuery :I wrapped the previous code in a recursive function to parse nested JSON responses.Maybe it will useful:output:IE7: string,object,string,stringCHROME: object,object,string,stringI think I know why you want to avoid that. But maybe try & catch !== try & catch. ;o) This came into my mind:So you may also dirty clip to the JSON object, like:As this as encapsuled as possible, it may not break on error.If there are errors, return false. If there are no errors, return json dataI prefere this way :
