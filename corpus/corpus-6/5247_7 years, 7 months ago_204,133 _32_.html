I am having some troubles with leading and trailing whitespace in a data.frame.\nEg I like to take a look at a specific row in a data.frame based on a certain condition:I was wondering why I didn\'t get the expected output since the country Austria obviously existed in my data.frame. After looking through my code history and trying to figure out what went wrong I tried:All I have changed in the command is an additional whitespace after Austria. Further annoying problems obviously arise. Eg when I like to merge two frames based on the country column. One data.frame uses "Austria " while the other frame has "Austria". The matching doesn\'t work.So far I used to write a simple Perl script which removes the whitespace but it would be nice if I can somehow do it inside R.Probably the best way is to handle the trailing whitespaces when you read your data file. If you use read.csv or read.table you can set the parameterstrip.white=TRUE.If you want to clean strings afterwards you could use one of these functions:To use one of these functions on myDummy$country:To \'show\' the whitespace you could use:which will show you the strings surrounded by quotation marks (") making whitespaces easier to spot.As of R 3.2.0 a new function was introduced for removing leading/trailing whitespaces:See: http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/trimws.html(now the only issue is getting on top as the best answer... :) )To manipulate the white space, use str_trim() in the stringr package.\nThe package has manual dated Feb 15,2013 and is in CRAN.\nThe function can also handle string vectors.(credit goes to commenter: R. Cotton)A simple function to remove leading and trailing whitespace:Usage:ad1) To see white spaces you could directly call print.data.frame with modified arguments:See also ?print.data.frame for other options.Use grep or grepl to find observations with whitespaces and sub to get rid of them.I\'d prefer to add the answer as comment to user56 but yet unable so writing as an independent answer.\nRemoving leading and trailing blanks might be achieved through trim() function from gdata package as well:Usage example:Another option is to use the stri_trim function from the stringi package which defaults to removing leading and trailing whitespace:For only removing leading whitespace, use stri_trim_left. For only removing trailing whitespace, use stri_trim_right. When you want to remove other leading or trailing characters, you have to specify that with pattern =.See also ?stri_trim for more info.Another related problem occurs if you have multiple spaces inbetween inputs:You can then easily split this string into "real" tokens using a regular expression to the split argument:Note that if there is a match at the beginning of\na (non-empty) string, the first element of the output is \xe2\x80\x98""\xe2\x80\x99, but\nif there is a match at the end of the string, the output is the\nsame as with the match removed.I created a trim.strings () function to trim leading and/or trailing whitespace as:For illustration, After this, you\'ll need to force R not to recognize "Austria " as a level. Let\'s pretend you also have "USA" and "Spain" as levels:A little less intimidating than the highest voted response, but it should still work.
