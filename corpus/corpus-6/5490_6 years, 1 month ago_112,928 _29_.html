I have a bunch of commits on my local repository which are thematically similar. I\'d like to combine them into a single commit before pushing up to a remote. How do I do it? I think rebase does this, but I can\'t make sense of the docs.What you want to do is referred to as "squashing" in git.  There are lots of options when you\'re doing this (too many?) but if you just want to merge all of your unpushed commits into a single commit, do this:This will bring up your text editor (-i is for "interactive") with a file that looks like this:Change all the pick to squash (or s) except the first one:Save your file and exit your editor.  Then another text editor will open to let you combine the commit messages from all of the commits into one big commit message.Voila! Googling "git squashing" will give you explanations of all the other options available.If you have lots of commits and you only want to squash the last X commits, find the commit ID of the commit from which you want to start squashing and doThen proceed as described in leopd\'s answer, changing all the picks to squashes except the first one.You can do this with git rebase -i, passing in the revision that you want to use as the \'root\':will open an editor window showing all of the commits you have made after the last commit in origin/master. You can reject commits, squash commits into a single commit, or edit previous commits.There are a few resources that can probably explain this in a better way, and show some other examples:http://book.git-scm.com/4_interactive_rebasing.htmlandhttp://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.htmlare the first two good pages I could find.There are quite a few working answers here, but I found this the easiest. This command will open up an editor, where you can just replace pick with squash in order to remove/merge them into onewhere, 4 is the number of commits you want to squash into one. This is explained here as well.I came up withCombines, sorts, unifies and remove empty lines from the commit message. I use this for local changes to a github wiki (using gollum)You can squash (join) commits with an Interactive Rebase. There is a pretty nice YouTube video which shows how to do this on the command line or with SmartGit:If you are already a SmartGit user then you can select all your outgoing commits (by holding down the Ctrl key) and open the context menu (right click) to squash your commits. It\'s very comfortable:There is also a very nice tutorial from Atlassian which shows how it works:And my way of squashing multiple push is (perhaps you pushed to your own branch many commits and now you wish to do a pull request and you don\'t want to clutter them with many commits which you have already pushed).  The way I do that (no other simpler option as far as I can tell is).Example:You can now pull request into from_branch_you_wish_to_pull_request_toYou probably want to use Interactive Rebasing, which is described in detail in that link.You can find other good resources if you search for "git rebase interactive".
