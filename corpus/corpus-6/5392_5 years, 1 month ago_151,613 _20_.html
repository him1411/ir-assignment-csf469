I know that we can easily use ng-repeat for json objects or arrays like:but how can we use the ng-repeat for dictionaries, for example:I want to use that with users dictionary:Is it possible?. If yes, how can I do it in AngularJs?Example for my question:\nIn C# we define dictionaries like:Is there a build-in function that returns the values from a dictionary like in c#?You can useSee ngRepeat documentation. Example: http://jsfiddle.net/WRtqV/1/I would also like to mention a new functionality of AngularJS ng-repeat, namely, special repeat start and end points. That functionality was added in order to repeat a series of HTML elements instead of just a single parent HTML element.In order to use repeater start and end points you have to define them by using ng-repeat-start and ng-repeat-end directives respectively. The ng-repeat-start directive works very similar to ng-repeat directive. The difference is that is will repeat all the HTML elements (including the tag it\'s defined on) up to the ending HTML tag where ng-repeat-end is placed (including the tag with ng-repeat-end).Sample code (from a controller):\nSample HTML template:\nOutput would look similar to the following (depending on HTML styling):As you can see, ng-repeat-start repeats all HTML elements (including the element with ng-repeat-start). All ng-repeat special properties (in this case $first and $index) also work as expected.JavaScript developers tend to refer to the above data-structure as either an object or hash instead of a Dictionary.Your syntax above is wrong as you are initializing the users object as null.  I presume this is a typo, as the code should read:To retrieve all the values from a hash, you need to iterate over it using a for loop:If you plan on doing a lot of work with data-structures in JavaScript then the underscore.js library is definitely worth a look.  Underscore comes with a values method which will perform the above task for you:I don\'t use Angular myself, but I\'m pretty sure there will be a convenience method build in for iterating over a hash\'s values (ah, there we go, Artem Andreev provides the answer above :))
