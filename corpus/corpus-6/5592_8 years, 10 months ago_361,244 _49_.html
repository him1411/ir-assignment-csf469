How can I check which version of Apache is installed on a Debian machine? Is there a command for doing this?Try apachectl -V:If it does not work for you, run the command with sudo.This works for my Debian:You should use apache2ctl -v or apache2 -v for newer Debian or Ubuntu distributions.or you can use apache2 -V to get more information.I am using Red Hat Linux and the following command works:The command varies depending on how your version of Linux has named the Apache Server.On Debian and Mac OS:On Red Hat and Amazon\'s EC2 Linux use:On other verisons of Linux try:You can use two different flags:If you want to run the command with the full directory like user3786265 did but don\'t know where your apache is located, use the whereis command:Try it with sudo You can also use the package manager directly:This isn\'t focused on just version number, but it will make a broader search, which will give you other useful information, like module versions.Another way round to check a package (including Apache) installed version on Debian-based system, we can use:e.g. for Apachewhich will show something like (look at the Installed line):For me this works on Debian 6 (Squeeze):Linux www809 2.6.26-2-xen-686 #1 SMP Wed Sep 21 09:56:47 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/LinuxI had to go to the right path:./apachectl: line 71: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted \n  Server version: Apache/2.2.21 (Unix) \n  Server built:   Dec 17 2011 19:57:53I tried running the command "httpd -V" and "apachectl -V", but I could not execute and was getting the error: -ksh: php: not found [No such file or directory]Then I tried another way. I went to the Apache directory on my server and then tried executing the command:This worked for me and returned the output:I hope this helps.You can use apachectl -V or apachectl -v. Both of them will return the Apache version information!You may be more like using apache2 -V or apache2 -v. It seems easier to remember!For me apachectl -V did not work, but apachectl fullstatus gave me my version.Some installations of Apache are fubar (think Oracle\'s packaging of it, OHS) and do not understand the -V flag, nor can be invoked directly without running into missing library errors.Easiest way is to use the strings command (part of binutils) on the httpd binary and grep for a string that might resemble a version. For example, assuming your httpd binary is under directory /foo/bar:Most binaries (not all) contain their version (at least their major version) as static strings. This is my go-to way to get versions (or to corroborate what a binary\'s help message matches what reality on the ground truly is.)Or, less directly:nmap -A localhost -p 80I think you have to be sure what type of installation you have binary or source.\nTo check what binary packages is installed: with root rights execute following command: result should be something like:To find version you can run : result should be something like:\nServer version: Apache/2.4.10 (Debian)Surely typing /usr/sbin/apache2 -v into the shell is the best and quickest way to go, by the way here\'s another option, just in case there\'s PHP too in your server and you\'re interested into gathering Apache version (and much more infos) in quick programmatical steps.Just make an info.php file in your Apache web root folder (or whatever you like)  and write these inside it:Now go to yoursite.com/info.php (or localhost/info.php for local machines).You\'ll see your Apache version in PHP Variables section, here\'s an example:phpinfo() example dump pageAlso, please notice that these steps obviously apply to any web server with PHP integration, so it\'s not limited to Apache and once created that page could be handy while developing (just don\'t forget to remove it on production environments!!)
