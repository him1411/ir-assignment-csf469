Multiple colours in an NSString or NSMutableStrings are not possible. So I\'ve heard a little about the NSAttributedString which was introduced with the iPad SDK 3.2 (or around 3.2) and is available on the iPhone as of iPhone SDK 4.0 beta.I would like to have a string that has three colours.The reason I don\'t use 3 separate NSStrings, is because the length of each of the three NSAttributedString substrings will be changing often and so I would prefer not to use any calculations to re-position 3 separate NSString objects.If it\'s possible using NSAttributedString how do I make the following - (if not possible with NSAttributed string how would you do it):Edit:\nRemember, @"first", @"second" and @"third" will be replaced by other strings at any time. So using hardcoded NSRange values won\'t work.When building attributed strings, I prefer to use the mutable subclass, just to keep things cleaner.That being said, here\'s how you create a tri-color attributed string:typed in a browser. caveat implementorObviously you\'re not going to hard-code in the ranges like this.  Perhaps instead you could do something like:The question is already answered... but I wanted to show how to add shadow and change the font with NSAttributedString as well, so that when people search for this topic they won\'t have to keep looking.Here is a Swift version...Warning! \nThis works for 4s.For 5s you have to change all of the the Float values to Double values (because the compiler isn\'t working correctly yet)Swift enum for font choice:Swift array for enum access (needed because enum can\'t use \'-\'):Swift attributed text function:first and last extension used for finding ranges in a string array:new colors:my macro replacement:my button maker w/attributed text:my UIView/UILabel maker w/attributed text, shadow, and round corners:generic shadow add:view extension for view style:the actual view did load function:I think, it is a very convenient way to use regular expressions to find a range for applying attributes. This is how I did it: I was searching for a list of available attributes and didn\'t find them here and in a class reference\'s first page. So I decided to post here information on that. Standard AttributesAttributed strings support the following standard attributes for text. If the key is not in the dictionary, then use the default values described below.NSAttributedString programming guideA full class reference is here. This solution will work for any lengthI wrote helper to add attributes easily:https://github.com/shmidt/MASAttributesYou can install through CocoaPods also : pod \'MASAttributes\', \'~> 1.0.0\'Since iOS 7 you can use NSAttributedString with HTML syntax:You have to add the file "string.html" to you project, and the content of the html can be like this:Now, you can use NSAttributedString as you want, even without HTML file, like for example:SourceI always found working with attributed strings to be an incredibly long winded and tedious process. So I made a Mac App that creates all the code for you. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/attributed-string-creator/id730928349?mt=12You can load an HTML attributed string in Swift as follow  To load a html from file    http://sketchytech.blogspot.in/2013/11/creating-nsattributedstring-from-html.html And setup string as per your required attribute....follow this..\nhttp://makeapppie.com/2014/10/20/swift-swift-using-attributed-strings-in-swift/I made a library that makes this a lot easier.  Check out ZenCopy:\nhttps://github.com/trifl/ZenCopyYou can create Style objects, and/or set them to keys to reference later. Like this:Then, you can easily construct strings AND style them AND have params :)You can also style things easily with regex searches!This will style all words with \'@\' in front of it with the \'token\' style. (e.g. @jpmcglone)I need to still get it working w/ everything NSAttributedString has to offer, but I think fontName, fontSize and color cover the bulk of it.  Expect lots of updates soon :)I can help you get started with this if you need. Also looking for feedback, so if it makes your life easier, I\'d say mission accomplished.To solve such kind of problems I created library in swift which is called Atributika.You can find it here https://github.com/psharanda/Atributika
