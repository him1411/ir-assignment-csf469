I am using maven to create a dynamic webapp in Eclipse. I added some folders like src/test/java and src/test/resources. Also I changed the library in Java Build Path to obtain the JavaSE-1.7. It\'s all OK up to here.When I tried to change the Projects Facet Dynamic Web Module something  went wrong. I had change the Java to 1.7 in the same place. And it still told me, cannot change version of project facet Dynamic Web Module to 3.0.I have changed everything that would effect the changing I think.I updated my web.xmland then just Maven -> Update Project ...Another way is to edit the project facet configuration file itself: org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.xmlChange the dynamic web module version in this line to 3.0 - <installed facet="jst.web" version="2.5"/> And then:You\'ll find this file in the .settings directory within the Eclipse project.I think I had the same problem as you. my web.xml had version 2.5 while the project had the (right-click on Project-> Properties-> Progect Facets->) Dynamic Web Module 2.3. \nAlthough I tried to change the version from 2.3 to 2.5 ECLIPSE did not permit it. \nSolution: I removed the check mark under the heading Dynamic Web Module, I saved and I had Update Project. Automatically re-awakening is entering the box with the correct version. I use Eclipse Kepler. Hope that useful.p.s.look at the comments of Jonathan just below, very useful. I had the same issue and I even tried to remove the project and add it again. What did the trick was to remove the .settings directory.Delete and import again the maven project.Right click the project â†’ Properties; in Project Facets, deselect Dynamic Web Module (version should be 3.1) and deselect JavaServer Faces (version is 2.2).Change this:to this:Then remove the prefix before param-name and the like.Finally, Maven -> Update project.What worked for me:In your POM - you have to set compiler plugin to version 1.8 (or 1.7) in <build> section:Ensure that change Java Build shows 1.8. If it does not - click EDIT and select what it should be.Instead of changing it:a) uncheck the Dynamic Web Moduleb) applyc) check it again. New version 3.0 should be set.**After applying and checking it again:Hope this helps.Open org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.xml file<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<faceted-project>\n  <fixed facet="wst.jsdt.web"/>\n  <installed facet="jst.web" version="2.3"/>\n  <installed facet="wst.jsdt.web" version="1.0"/>\n  <installed facet="java" version="1.8"/>\n</faceted-project>Change the version like this  <installed facet="jst.web" version="3.1"/>Just this worked to me.you please open the Navigator view  and following stepOpen web.xml from project structure\nhttp://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"\n    version="3.0">\n    Servlet 3.0 Web Application\nand update web.xml file\nfor example change version = "2.5"Also change the org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.xml file from your project .settings file\nFollow the steps\n1. Window > Show View > Other > General > NavigatorThere is a .settings folder under your project directoryChange the dynamic web module version in this line to 2.5\n4.Change the Java version in this line to 1.5 or higher Now refresh your project and get set to run on your server. Do follow the blog for the solution \nhttp://scrapillars.blogspot.in/2014/02/how-to-change-project-facet-in-eclipse.htmlThe solution is produced with image illustrationsBest and simple steps solved this problem for me is \n1) Properties -> Project Facets -> Deselect/unmark the check box of Dynamic Web Module -> Apply\n2)Now change to the desired version Apply\n3)Check the Dynamic web Module check box..\n--Now your are done--Their is one more way to resolve this problem (check it out hope it will help you to solve your problem)PROBLEMCannot change version of project facet dynamic web module 2.3 to 3.0SOLUTION In my case the web.xml was referenced by a dtd. After I changed this to xsd reference like the one posted by Sydney it worked.The web.xml trick works because you\'re now explicitly telling WTP that you are using that specific servlet version, regardless of what the container supports. In my case, I am using the annotation config within a Maven project and I do not have a web.xml file. It turns out that in the absence of a web.xml, WTP looks at your Maven dependencies to determine what Servlet version to use. In my case, I had defined the following:Changing it to 6.0 fixed the problem and it\'s now using Servlet 3.0 instead of 3.1, which is the default for JavaEE 7. Since I had to go from Tomcat 8 to Tomcat 7, Tomcat 7 only supports the JavaEE 6 Web profile. Now things work wonderfully.I had the same issue ,deleting the .settings folder resolved the issueMy solution to the problem that didn\'t allowed me to change the version of project facet Dynamic Web Module in Eclipse (Mars) was:I tried many of the answers here, but none of them worked for me.\nThen I found an article about my problem here. I thought of sharing it here too.Below are the steps taken in brief.For a maven eclipse web project, changing dynamic web module version needs to check three places. If one uses eclipse, and after you have checked the following:\n1) web.xml 2) maven: 3) eclipse build path and compiler version is 1.7you still have an error marker at maven:Then you can:\nuncheck the dynamic web module, and recheck it.\nI think it is because .settings of eclipse file is corrupted somehow. About the second tip tomcat which version is a good note.Doing maven update or reimporting the project did not help. @Sydney\'s answer is right; in addition I have to recreate the project in different workspace as  said in JavaServer Faces 2.2 requires Dynamic Web Module 2.5 or newerI had the same issue, editing web.xml as well as changing file in .settings folder alone didn\'t help. My solution was to directly point maven compiler plugin to use the desired java version by editing pom.xml:Now run Maven->Update project and after that you can change servlets version in properties->project facets->Dynamic Web module version or, as written earlier, by manually editing org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.xml in .settings folder of your project.Open the org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.xml file and change the jst.web version to 3.0. Also update the web.xml to version 3.0. Save and update the project. Hope this helps. I am using Eclipse JunoThis is a variation on pagurix\'s answer, but using Eclipse Mars. Change your web.xml file to web.bak Ignore the errors, we\'ll regenerate it next. Go into project properties -> project facets and set the Dynamic Web Module version to what you need. Eclipse now allows you to save. Now right-click on the project. Choose Java EE Tools -> Generate Deployment Descriptor Stub. This creates a new web.xml with the required version. Open the new web.xml and copy across the XML header and the complete web-app opening tag to your original web.bak, delete the new web.xml and rename web.bak back to web.xml.Done.Mine was Web Module 3.0 in web.xml, but in properties>Dynamic Web Module It was on 3.1I changed the web.xml to this:after this change, do: right click on project>Maven>Update Project...If answer by Sydney still doesn\'t help then try below.\nAfter following Sydney\'s answer, goto Properties > Projects Facets deselect Dynamic Web Module and then change the version to match your web.config and then select again. Apply > Save\nThen Maven Update.web.xmlThis Problem With version right click on the project->properties->Project Facets->right click on Dynamic Web Module->unlock it-> uncheck->select 2.5 version->Apply->Update the mavenI resolved the issue by modifying web.xml with correct version,xsd locations and modifying org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.xml with correct version and doing maven update.updating maven worked for meselect project then press ALT+F5 then select project click ok
