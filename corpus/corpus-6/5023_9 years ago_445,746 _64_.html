How can I find/replace all CRLF characters in notepad++?  Looking for something equivalent to the ^p special character in Word.[\\r\\n]+ should work tooUpdate March, 26th 2012, release date of Notepad++ 6.0:OMG, it actually does work now!!!Original answer 2008 (Notepad++ 4.x) - 2009-2010-2011 (Notepad++ 5.x)Actually no, it does not seem to work with regexp...But if you have Notepad++ 5.x, you can use the \'extended\' search mode and look for \\r\\n. That does find all your CRLF.(I realize this is the same answer than the others, but again, \'extended mode\' is only available with Notepad++ 4.9, 5.x and more)Since April 2009, you have a wiki article on the Notepad++ site on this topic:\n"How To Replace Line Ends, thus changing the line layout".\n(mentioned by georgiecasey in his/her answer below)Some relevant extracts includes the following search processes:You can select an EOL in the editing window. The "Extended" option shows \\n and \\r as characters that could be matched.\n  As with the Normal search mode, Notepad++ is looking for the exact character.\n  Searching for \\r in a UNIX-format file will not find anything, but searching for \\n will. Similarly, a Macintosh-format file will contain \\r but not \\n.Regular expressions use the characters ^ and $ to anchor the match string to the beginning or end of the line. For instance, searching for return;$ will find occurrences of "return;" that occur with no subsequent text on that same line. The anchor characters work identically in all file formats.\n  The \'.\' dot metacharacter does not match line endings.[Tested in Notepad++ 5.8.5]: a regular expression search with an explicit \\r or \\n does not work (contrary to the Scintilla documentation).\n  Neither does a search on an explicit (pasted) LF, or on the (invisible) EOL characters placed in the field when an EOL is selected.\n  Advanced search (Ctrl+R) without regexpCtrl+M will insert something that matches newlines. They will be replaced by the replace string.\n  I recommend this method as the most reliable, unless you really need to use regex.\n  As an example, to remove every second newline in a double spaced file, enter Ctrl+M twice in the search string box, and once in the replace string box.Neither Ctrl+M, $ nor \\r\\n are matched. The same wiki also mentions the Hex editor alternative:Note: the character selected for new line usually appears as 0a.\n  It may have a different value if the file is in Windows Format. In that case you can always go to Edit -> EOL Conversion -> Convert to Unix Format, and after the replacement switch it back and Edit -> EOL Conversion -> Convert to Windows Format.It appears that this is a FAQ, and the resolution offered is:Simple search (Ctrl+H) without regexpYou can turn on View/Show End of Line\n  or view/Show All, and select the now\n  visible newline characters. Then when\n  you start the command some characters\n  matching the newline character will be\n  pasted into the search field. Matches\n  will be replaced by the replace\n  string, unlike in regex mode.Note 1: If you select them with the\n  mouse, start just before them and drag\n  to the start of the next line.\n  Dragging to the end of the line won\'t\n  work. Note 2: You can\'t copy and paste\n  them into the field yourself.Advanced search (Ctrl+R) without regexpCtrl+M will insert something that matches newlines. They will be replaced by the replace string.On the Replace dialog, you want to set the search mode to "Extended".  Normal or Regular Expression modes wont work.Then just find "\\r\\n"  (or just \\n for unix files or just \\r for mac format files), and set the replace to whatever you want.I\'ve not had much luck with \\r\\n regular expressions from the find/replace window.However, this works in Notepad++ v4.1.2:Use the "View | Show end of line" menu to enable display of end of line characters.\n(Carriage return line feeds should show up as a single shaded CRLF \'character\'.)Select one of the CRLF \'characters\' (put the cursor just in front of one, hold down the SHIFT key, and then pressing the RIGHT CURSOR key once).Copy the CRLF character to the clipboard.Make sure that you don\'t have the find or find/replace dialog open.Open the find/replace dialog.\nThe \'Find what\' field shows the contents of the clipboard: in this case the CRLF character - which shows up as 2 \'box characters\' (presumably it\'s an unprintable character?)Ensure that the \'Regular expression\' option is OFF.Now you should be able to count, find, or replace as desired.The way I found it to work is by using the Replace function, and using "\\n", with the "Extended" mode.  I\'m using version 5.8.5.Image with CRLFImage without CRLFin 2013, v6.13 or later, use:Assuming it has a "regular expressions" search, look for \\r\\n.  I prefer \\r?\\n, because some files don\'t use carriage returns.EDIT: Thanks for the feedback, whoever voted this down.  I have learned that... well, nothing, because you provided no feedback.  Why is this wrong?Use the advanced search option (ctrl-R) and use the keyboard shortcut for CRLF (ctrl-M) to insert a carriage return.If you need to do a complex regexp replacement including  \\r\\n, you can workaround limitation by a three steps approach :I opened the file in notepad++ and did a replacement in a few stepsThis puts all the breaks where they should be and removes those that are breaking up the file.It worked for me and I hope it helps you :)maybe you can use TextFX pluginsin TextFX go to textfx edit --> delete blank linesTo change a document of separate lines into a single line, with each line forming one entry in a comma separated list:These steps turn e.g.foo barbar bazbaz foointo:foo bar,bar baz,baz fooor: (depending on preference)foo bar, bar baz, baz fooJust do a \\r with a find and replace with a blank in the replace field so everything goes up to one line. Then do a find and replace (in my case by semi colon) and replace with ;\\n:)\n-T&CMake this setting. Menu-> View-> Show Symbol-> uncheck Show End of the Line
