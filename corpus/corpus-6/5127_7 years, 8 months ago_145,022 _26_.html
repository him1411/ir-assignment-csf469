I accidentely said git rm -r .. How do I recover from this?I did not commit.I think all files were marked for deletion and were also physically removed from my local checkout.EDIT: I could (if I knew the command) revert to the last commit. But it would be a lot better if I could just undo the git rm -r .. Because I am not really sure what I did after the last commit and before the git rm -r ..Should do it. If you don\'t have any uncommitted changes that you care about, thenshould forcibly reset everything to your last commit. If you do have uncommitted changes, but the first command doesn\'t work, then save your uncommitted changes with git stash:I git-rm\'d a few files and went on making changes before my next commit when I realized I needed some of those files back. Rather than stash and reset, you can simply checkout the individual files you missed/removed if you want:This leaves your other uncommitted changes intact with no workarounds.To regain some single files or folders one may use the followingThis will first recreate the index entries for path/to/file and recreate the file as it was in the last commit, i.e.HEAD.Hint: one may pass a commit hash to both commands to recreate files from an older commit. See git reset --help and git checkout --help for details.Update:Since git rm . deletes all files in this and child directories in the working checkout as well as in the index, you need to undo each of these changes:This should do what you want.  It does not affect parent folders of your checked-out code or index.Old answer that wasn\'t:will do the trick, and will not erase any uncommitted changes you have made to your files.after that you need to repeat any git add commands you had queued up.If you end up with none of the above working, you might be able to retrieve data using the suggestion from here: http://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg62499.htmlIf you\'ve committed and pushed the changes, you can do this to get the file backThere are some good answers already, but I might suggest a little-used syntax that not only works great, but is very explicit in what you want (therefor not scary or mysterious)Get list commitFor example, Stable commit has hash: 45ff319c360cd7bd5442c0fbbe14202d20ccdf81I had an identical situation. In my case the solution was:I had exactly the same issue: was cleaning up my folders, rearranging and moving files. I entered: git rm . and hit enter; and then felt my bowels loosen a bit. Luckily, I didn\'t type in git commit -m "" straightaway. However, the following commandrestored everything, and saved my life.
