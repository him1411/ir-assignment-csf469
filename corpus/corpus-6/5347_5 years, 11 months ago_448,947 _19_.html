I have a char array:My current solution is to do But surely there is a better way of doing this?No, that solution is absolutely correct and very minimal. Note however, that this is a very unusual situation: Because String is handled specially in Java, even "foo" is actually a String. So the need for splitting a String into individual chars and join them back is not required in normal code.Compare this to C/C++ where "foo" you have a bundle of chars terminated by a zero byte on one side and string on the other side and many conversions between them due do legacy methods.String text = String.copyValueOf(data); or String text = String.valueOf(data);is arguably better (encapsulates the new String call).This will convert char array back to string:A String in java is merely an object around an array of chars. Hence ais identical to an unboxed String with the same characters. By creating a new String from your array of charactersyou are essentially telling the compiler to autobox a String object around your array of characters.Try thisTry this:You can also use StringBuilder classUse of String or StringBuilder varies with your method requirements.1 alternate way is to do:
