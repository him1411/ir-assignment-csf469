I\'m trying to setup up MySQL on mac os 10.6 using Homebrew by brew install mysql 5.1.52.Everything goes well and I am also successful with the mysql_install_db.\nHowever when I try to connect to the server using:I get: I\'ve tried to access mysqladmin or mysql using -u root -proot as well,\nbut it doesn\'t work with or without password. This is a brand new installation on a brand new machine and as far as I know the new installation must be accessible without a root password. I also tried:but I also get I think one can end up in this position with older versions of mysql already installed. I had the same problem and none of the above solutions worked for me. I fixed it thus:Used brew\'s remove & cleanup commands, unloaded the launchctl script, then deleted the mysql directory in /usr/local/var, deleted my existing /etc/my.cnf (leave that one up to you, should it apply) and launchctl plistUpdated the string for the plist. Note also your alternate security script directory will be based on which version of MySQL you are installing.Step-by-step:I then started from scratch:ran the commands brew suggested: (see note: below)Start mysql with mysql.server start command, to be able to log on itUsed the alternate security script:Followed the launchctl section from the brew package script output such as,Boom.Hope that helps someone!Note: the --force bit on brew cleanup will also cleanup outdated kegs, think it\'s a new-ish homebrew feature.Note the second: a commenter says step 2 is not required. I don\'t want to test it, so YMMV! Had the same problem. Seems like there is something wrong with the set up instructions or the initial tables that are being created. This is how I got mysqld running on my machine.If the mysqld server is already running on your Mac, stop it first with:launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mysql.mysqld.plistStart the mysqld server with the following command which lets anyone log in with full permissions.mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tablesThen run mysql -u root which should now let you log in successfully without a password. The following command should reset all the root passwords.UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD(\'NewPassword\') WHERE User=\'root\'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;Now if you kill the running copy of mysqld_safe and start it up again without the skip-grant-tables option, you should be able to log in with mysql -u root -p and the new password you just set.Here are detailed instructions combining getting rid of all MySQL from your Mac then installing it The Brew Way as Sedorner wrote above:mysql should now work and be running all the time as expectedGodspeed.I had the same problem just now. If you brew info mysql and follow the steps it looks like the root password should be new-password if I remember correctly. I was seeing the same thing you are seeing. This article helped me the most. It turned out I didn\'t have any accounts created for me. When I logged in after running mysqld_safe and did select * from user; no rows were returned. I opened the MySQLWorkbench with the mysqld_safe running and added a root account with all the privs I expected. This are working well for me now. Okay I had the same issue and solved it. For some reason the mysql_secure_installation script doesn\'t work out of the box when using Homebrew to install mysql, so I did it manually. On the CLI enter:That should get you into mysql. Now do the following (taken from mysql_secure_installation):Now exit and get back into mysql with: mysql -u root -pIf brew installed MySQL 5.7, the process is a bit different than for previous versions.\nIn order to reset the root password, proceed as follows:A temporary password will be printed to the console and it can only be used for updating the root password:brew info mysqlmysql.service startor mysql -u rootI\'m looking for a solution for some time but I can not solve my problem. I tried several solutions in stackoverflow.com but no this helping me.Stop mysql completely.Remove files.  Instructions above are good.  I\'ll add:Hopefully you have homebrew.  If not, download it.I like to run brew as root, but I don\'t think you have to.Try by giving Grant permission Command of mysqlNone of the above answers (or any of the dozens of answers I saw elsewhere) worked for me when using brew with the most recent version of mysql and yosemite. I ended up installing a different mysql version via brew.Specifying an older version by saying (for example)Worked for me. Hope this helps someone. This was a frustrating problem that  I felt like I was stuck on forever.TL;DRMySQL server might not be running after installation with Brew. Try brew services start mysql or just mysql.server start if you don\'t want MySQL to run as a background service.Full Story:I just installed MySQL (stable) 5.7.17 on a new MacBook Pro running Sierra and also got an error when running mysql_secure_installation:Say what?According to the installation info from Brew, mysql_secure_installation should prompt me to... secure the installation. I figured the MySQL server might not be running and rightly so. Running brew services start mysql and then mysql_secure_installation worked like a charm.I had the same issue after I tried to restart mysql.I use the following two aliases in my .profile for convenienceAfter stoping mysql and then trying to restart I experienced the issue you were having. I looked into the launchctl load and it was reporting a \xe2\x80\x9cnothing found to load\xe2\x80\x9d error.After a quick search I found this..http://www.daveoncode.com/2013/02/01/solve-mac-osx-launchctl-nothing-found-to-load-error/So I updated me mysql-start alias as followsThis solved my issue which may be useful for you.The "Base-Path" for Mysql is stored in /etc/my.cnf which is not updated when you do brew upgrade. Just open it and change the basedir valueFor example, change this:to point to the new version:Restart mysql with:
