I am using Json.NET to serialize a class to JSON.I have the class like this:I want to add a JsonIgnore() attribute to Test2List property only when Test2List is null. If it is not null then I want to include it in my json.As per James Newton King: If you create the serializer yourself rather than using JavaScriptConvert there is a NullValueHandling property which you can set to ignore.Here\'s a sample:Alternatively, as suggested by @amitAn alternate solution using the JsonProperty attribute:As seen in this online doc.Similar to @sirthomas\'s answer, JSON.NET also respects the EmitDefaultValue property on DataMemberAttribute:This may be desirable if you are already using [DataContract] and [DataMember] in your model type and don\'t want to add JSON.NET-specific attributes.You can do this to ignore all nulls in an object you\'re serializing, and any null properties won\'t then appear in the JSONAs can be seen in this link on their site (http://james.newtonking.com/archive/2009/10/23/efficient-json-with-json-net-reducing-serialized-json-size.aspx) I support using [Default()] to specify default valuesTaken from the linkAn adaption to @Mrchief\'s / @amit\'s answer,  but for people using VBSee:\n "Object Initializers: Named and Anonymous Types (Visual Basic)"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb385125.aspxTo expound slightly on GlennG\'s very helpful answer (translating the syntax from C# to VB.Net is not always "obvious") you can also decorate individual class properties to manage how null values are handled. If you do this don\'t use the global JsonSerializerSettings from GlennG\'s suggestion, otherwise it will override the individual decorations. This comes in handy if you want a null item to appear in the JSON so the consumer doesn\'t have to do any special handling.  If, for example, the consumer needs to know an array of optional items is normally available, but is currently empty...\nThe decoration in the property declaration looks like this:For those properties you don\'t want to have appear at all in the JSON change :=NullValueHandling.Include to :=NullValueHandling.Ignore.\nBy the way - I\'ve found that you can decorate a property for both XML and JSON serialization just fine (just put them right next to each other). This gives me the option to call the XML serializer in dotnet or the NewtonSoft serializer at will - both work side-by-side and my customers have the option to work with XML or JSON.  This is slick as snot on a doorknob since I have customers that require both!
