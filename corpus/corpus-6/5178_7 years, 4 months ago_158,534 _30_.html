I want to disable the orange highlight that occurs when touching a listView row. So far in my xml I have tried the following:More information: I want there to be zero difference when a user touches the screen on this listView object.Add this to your xml:And for the problem this may work (I\'m not sure and i dont know if there are better solutions):You could apply a ColorStateList to your TextView.RoflcoptrException\'s answer should do the trick,but for some reason it did not work for me, So I am posting the solution which worked for me, hope it helps someoneThe orange highlight effect is a style on the ListView.  This article gives a good overview of how to override the listView style.Essentially, you have a selector that specifies different style elements based on the current state. see this for short and quick solution https://stackoverflow.com/a/12242564/185022from http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/03c92af7b519d290?pli=1when you set your ListAdapter use the following codeThis will override the BaseAdapter class.  It also cancels the white border between cells.add this also to ur XMl along with listselector..hope it will workIf you are using ArrayAdapter or BaseAdapter to populate the list items. Override the isEnabled method and return false.After a few \'google\'ing and testing on virtual and real devices, I notice my below code works:notice that I\'ve omitted the areAllItemsEnabled() portion.Nothing helps me but this:transparent_drawable.xmllayout.xmlin codeand add small transparent image to drawable folder. Like: \ntransparent.xmlFor me android:focusableInTouchMode="true" is the way to go. android:listSelector="@android:color/transparent"  is of no use. Note that I am using a custom listview with a number of objects in each row.You only need to add:\nandroid:cacheColorHint="@android:color/transparent"As an alternative:orIf you want to disable the highlight for a single list view item, but keep the cell enabled, set the background color for that cell to disable the highlighting.For instance, in your cell layout, set android:background="@color/white"you can just get the pos that you get from the onItemClick\nand do:that\'s the best way i know of
