How do I get:toNo CURSOR, WHILE loop, or User-Defined Function needed.  Just need to be creative with FOR XML and PATH.[Note: This solution only works on SQL 2005 and later. Original question didn\'t specify the version in use.]using XML path will not perfectly concatenate as you might expect... it will replace "&" with "&amp;" and will also mess with <" and ">\n...maybe a few other things, not sure...but you can try thisI came across a workaround for this... you need to replace:with:...or NVARCHAR(MAX) if thats what youre using.why the hell doesn\'t SQL have a concatenate aggregate function? this is a PITA.I ran into a couple of problems when I tried converting Kevin Fairchild\'s suggestion to work with strings containing spaces and special XML characters (&, <, >) which were encoded.The final version of my code (which doesn\'t answer the original question but may be useful to someone) looks like this:Rather than using a space as a delimiter and replacing all the spaces with commas, it just pre-pends a comma and space to each value then uses STUFF to remove the first two characters.The XML encoding is taken care of automatically by using the TYPE directive.Another option using Sql Server 2005 and aboveSQL Server 2005 and later allow you to create your own custom aggregate functions, including for things like concatenation- see the sample at the bottom of the linked article.Just to add to what Cade said, this is usually a front-end display thing and should therefore be handled there. I know that sometimes it\'s easier to write something 100% in SQL for things like file export or other "SQL only" solutions, but most of the times this concatenation should be handled in your display layer.Install the SQLCLR Aggregates from http://groupconcat.codeplex.comThen you can write code like this to get the result you asked for:This kind of question is asked here very often, and the solution is going to depend a lot on the underlying requirements:https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=sql+pivotandhttps://stackoverflow.com/search?q=sql+concatenateTypically, there is no SQL-only way to do this without either dynamic sql, a user-defined function, or a cursor.Eight years later... Microsoft SQL Server vNext Database Engine has finally enhanced Transact-SQL to directly support grouped string concatenation. The Community Technical Preview version 1.0 added the STRING_AGG function and CTP 1.1 added the WITHIN GROUP clause for the STRING_AGG function.Reference: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt775028.aspxIn Oracle you can use LISTAGG aggregate function.\nAn example would be:Would result in:If it is SQL Server 2017 or SQL Server Vnext, SQL Azure you can use string_agg as below:Don\'t need a cursor... a while loop is sufficient.This is just an addition to Kevin Fairchild\'s post (very clever by the way). I would have added it as a comment, but I don\'t have enough points yet :)I was using this idea for a view I was working on, however the items I was concatinating contained spaces. So I modified the code slightly to not use spaces as delimiters. Again thanks for the cool workaround Kevin!Let\'s get very simple:Replace this line:With your query.You can improve performance significant the following way if group by contains mostly one item: didn\'t see any cross apply answers, also no need for xml extraction.  Here is a slightly different version of what Kevin Fairchild wrote. It\'s faster and easier to use in more complex queries:
