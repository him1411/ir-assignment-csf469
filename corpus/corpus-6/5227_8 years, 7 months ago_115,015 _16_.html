Which is the best way to extend a dictionary with another one? For instance:I\'m looking for any operation to obtain this avoiding for loop:I wish to do something like:Python Standard Library DocumentationA beautiful gem in this closed question:The "oneliner way", altering neither of the input dicts, isLearn what **basket_two (the **) means here.In case of conflict, the items from basket_two will override the ones from basket_one.  As one-liners go, this is pretty readable and transparent, and I have no compunction against using it any time a dict that\'s a mix of two others comes in handy (any reader who has trouble understanding it will in fact be very well served by the way this prompts him or her towards learning about dict and the ** form;-).  So, for example, uses like:are reasonably frequent occurrences in my code.Originally submitted by Alex MartelliNote: In Python 3, this will only work if every key in basket_two is a string.Will add keys and values from b to a, overwriting if there\'s already a value for a key.As others have mentioned, a.update(b) for some dicts a and b will achieve the result you\'ve asked for in your question. However, I want to point out that many times I have seen the extend method of mapping/set objects desire that in the syntax a.extend(b), a\'s values should NOT be overwritten by b\'s values. a.update(b) overwrites a\'s values, and so isn\'t a good choice for extend.Note that some languages call this method defaults or inject, as it can be thought of as a way of injecting b\'s values (which might be a set of default values) in to a dictionary without overwriting values that might already exist.Of course, you could simple note that a.extend(b) is nearly the same as b.update(a); a=b. To remove the assignment, you could do it thus:Thanks to Tom Leys for that smart idea using a side-effect-less dict constructor for extend.
