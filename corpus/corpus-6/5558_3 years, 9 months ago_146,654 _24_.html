How can I replace \\n in Sublime Text with real in-editor displayed new line so:becomes:in the editor when I view the file in it.Turn on Regex Search and Replace (icon most to the left in search and replace bar or shortcut Alt + R)Find What: \\\\n\nReplace with: \\nCheersUse Find > Replace, or (Ctrl+H), to open the Find What/Replace With Window, and use Ctrl+Enter to indicate a new line in the Replace With inputbox.Fool proof method (no RegEx and Ctrl+Enter didn\'t work for me as it was just jumping to next Find):First, select an occurrence of \\n and hit Ctrl+H (brings up the Replace... dialogue, also accessible through Find -> Replace... menu). This populates the Find what field.Go to the end of any line of your file (press End if your keyboard has it) and select the end of line by holding down Shift and pressing \xe2\x86\x92 (right arrow) EXACTLY once. Then copy-paste this into the Replace with field.(the animation is for finding true new lines; works the same for replacing them)In Sublime Text (with shortcuts on Mac):Highlight the text that you want to search to apply Find & ReplaceGo to Menu > Find > Replace... (Keyboard Shortcut: Alt + Command + F)In the Find & Replace tool, enable Regular Expression by clicking on the button which looks like [.*] (Keyboard Shortcut: Alt + Command + R)In Find What, type: \\\\n Note: The additional \\ escapes the Regular Expression syntax when searched.In Replace With, type: \\nClick on the \'Replace All\' button (Keyboard Shortcut: CTRL + Alt + Enter)Your literal text \\n will then turn into an actual line break.None of the above worked for me in Sublime Text 2 on Windows.I did this:By selecting before hitting ctrl+H it uses that as the character to be replaced.
