What\'s the best way to implement the enum idiom in Ruby? I\'m looking for something which I can use (almost) like the Java/C# enums.Two ways. Symbols (:foo notation) or constants (FOO notation).Symbols are appropriate when you want to enhance readability without littering code with literal strings.Constants are appropriate when you have an underlying value that is important. Just declare a module to hold your constants and then declare the constants within that.The most idiomatic way to do this is to use symbols.  For example, instead of:...you can just use symbols:This is a bit more open-ended than enums, but it fits well with the Ruby spirit.Symbols also perform very well. Comparing two symbols for equality, for example, is much faster than comparing two strings.I\'m surprised that no one has offered something like the following (harvested from the RAPI gem):Which can be used like so:Example:This plays well in database scenarios, or when dealing with C style constants/enums (as is the case when using FFI, which RAPI makes extensive use of).Also, you don\'t have to worry about typos causing silent failures, as you would with using a hash-type solution.I using approach:I like it for the following advantages:Symbols may be better cause you don\'t have to write the name of outer class, if you are using it in another class (MyClass::MY_VALUE_1)If you are using Rails 4.2 or greater you can use Rails enums.Rails now has enums by default without the need for including any gems.This is very similar (and more with features) to Java, C++ enums.Quoted from http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Enum.html :This is my approach to enums in Ruby. I was going for short and sweet, not necessarily the the most C-like. Any thoughts?Check out the ruby-enum gem, https://github.com/dblock/ruby-enum.I know it\'s been a long time since the guy posted this question, but I had the same question and this post didn\'t give me the answer. I wanted an easy way to see what the number represents, easy comparison, and most of all ActiveRecord support for lookup using the column representing the enum.I didn\'t find anything, so I made an awesome implementation called yinum which allowed everything I was looking for. Made ton of specs, so I\'m pretty sure it\'s safe.Some example features:Someone went ahead and wrote a ruby gem called Renum. It claims to get the closest Java/C# like behavior. Personally I\'m still learning Ruby, and I was a little shocked when I wanted to make a specific class contain a static enum, possibly a hash, that it wasn\'t exactly easily found via google.If you\'re worried about typos with symbols, make sure your code raises an exception when you access a value with a non-existent key. You can do this by using fetch rather than []:or by making the hash raise an exception by default if you supply a non-existent key:If the hash already exists, you can add on exception-raising behaviour:Normally, you don\'t have to worry about typo safety with constants. If you misspell a constant name, it\'ll usually raise an exception.Recently we released a gem that implements Enums in Ruby. In my post you will find the answers on your questions. Also I described there why our implementation is better than existing ones (actually there are many implementations of this feature in Ruby yet as gems). It all depends how you use Java or C# enums. How you use it will dictate the solution you\'ll choose in Ruby.Try the native Set type, for instance:Symbols is the ruby way. However, sometimes one need to talk to some C code or something or Java that expose some enum for various things.This can then be used like thisThis is can of course be made abstract and you can roll our own Enum class I have implemented enums like that then its easy to do operations ......Perhaps the best lightweight approach would beThis way values have associated names, as in Java/C#:To get all values, you can doIf you want an enum\'s ordinal value, you can doThis seems a bit superfluous, but this is a methodology that I have used a few times, especially where I am integrating with xml or some such.This gives me the rigor of a c# enum and it is tied to the model.Most people use symbols (that\'s the :foo_bar syntax). They\'re sort of unique opaque values. Symbols don\'t belong to any enum-style type so they\'re not really a faithful representation of C\'s enum type but this is pretty much as good as it gets.Output:1 - a\n2 - b\n3 - c\n4 - dOutput:Sometimes all I need is to be able to fetch enum\'s value and identify its name similar to java world.This to me serves the purpose of enum and keeps it very extensible too. You can add more methods to the Enum class and viola get them for free in all the defined enums. for example. get_all_names and stuff like that.Another approach is to use a Ruby class with a hash containing names and values as described in the following RubyFleebie blog post. This allows you to convert easily between values and constants (especially if you add a class method to lookup the name for a given value).I think the best way to implement enumeration like types is with symbols since the pretty much behave as integer (when it comes to performace, object_id is used to make comparisons  ); you don\'t need to worry about indexing and they look really neat in your code xDAnother way to mimic an enum with consistent equality handling (shamelessly adopted from Dave Thomas). Allows open enums (much like symbols) and closed (predefined) enums.Another solution is using OpenStruct. Its pretty straight forward and clean.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/ostruct/rdoc/OpenStruct.htmlExample:
