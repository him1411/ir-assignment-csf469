If I have a date 01/01/2009, I want to find out what day it was e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc...Is there a built-in function for this in SQL 2005/2008? Or do I need to use an auxiliary table?Use DATENAME or DATEPART:Even though SQLMenace\'s answer has been accepted, there is one important SET option you should be aware ofSET DATEFIRSTDATENAME will return correct date name but not the same DATEPART value if the first day of week has been changed as illustrated below.To get a deterministic value for the day of week for a given date you could use a combination of DATEPART() and @@datefirst. Otherwise your dependent on the settings on the server.Check out the following site for a better solution:\nMS SQL: Day of WeekThe day of week will then be in the range 0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc. Then you can use a simple case statement to return the correct weekday name.EUROPE:this is a working copy of my code check it, how to retrive day name from date in sqlHappy coding....With SQL Server 2012 and onward you can use the FORMAT functionYou may find this version usefull.If you don\'t want to depend on @@DATEFIRST or use DATEPART(weekday, DateColumn), just calculate the day of the week yourself.For Monday based weeks (Europe) simplest is:For Sunday based weeks (America) use:This return the weekday number (1 to 7) ever since January 1st respectively 7th, 1753.
