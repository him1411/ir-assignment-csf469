I\'m trying to find a working example of the twitter bootstrap typeahead element that will make an ajax call to populate it\'s dropdown. I have an existing working jquery autocomplete example which defines the ajax url to and how to process the replyWhat do i need change to convert this to the typeahead example? I\'m going to wait for the \'Add remote sources support for typeahead\' issue to be resolved.Edit: typeahead is no longer bundled in Bootstrap 3. Check out:As of Bootstrap 2.1.0 up to 2.3.2, you can do this:To consume JSON data like this:Note that the JSON data must be of the right mime type (application/json) so jQuery recognizes it as JSON.You can use the BS Typeahead fork which supports ajax calls.\nThen you will be able to write:Starting from Bootstrap 2.1.0:HTML:Javascript:Now you can make a unified code, placing "json-request" links in your HTML-code.All of the responses refer to BootStrap 2 typeahead, which is no longer present in BootStrap 3.For anyone else directed here looking for an AJAX example using the new post-Bootstrap Twitter typeahead.js, here\'s a working example. The syntax is a little different:This example uses both synchronous (the call to processSync) and asynchronous suggestion, so you\'d see some options appear immediately, then others are added. You can just use one or the other.There are lots of bindable events and some very powerful options, including working with objects rather than strings, in which case you\'d use your own custom display function to render your items as text.I\'ve augmented the original typeahead Bootstrap plugin with ajax capabilities. Very easy to use:Here\'s the github repo: Ajax-TypeaheadI did some modifications on the jquery-ui.min.js:and add following cssWorks perfect.To those looking for a coffeescript version of the accepted answer:I went through this post and everything didnt want to work correctly and eventually pieced the bits together from a few answers so I have a 100% working demo and will paste it here for reference - paste this into a php file and make sure includes are in the right place.I am using this methodUPDATE: I modified my code using this fork also instead of using $.each I changed to $.map as suggested by Tomislav MarkovskiHowever I am encountering some problems by gettingUncaught TypeError: Cannot call method \'toLowerCase\' of undefinedas you can see on a newer post I am trying to figure out herehope this update is of any help to you...One can make calls by using Bootstrap. The current version does not has any source update issues\nTrouble updating Bootstrap's typeahead data-source with post response \n, i.e. the source of bootstrap once updated can be again modified.Please refer to below for an example:Try this if your service is not returning the right application/json content type header:I don\'t have a working example for you nor do I have a very clean solution, but let me tell you what I\'ve found.If you look at the javascript code for TypeAhead it looks like this:This code uses the jQuery "grep" method to match an element in the source array. I didn\'t see any places you could hook in an AJAX call, so there\'s not a "clean" solution to this.However, one somewhat hacky way that you can do this is to take advantage of the way the grep method works in jQuery. The first argument to grep is the source array and the second argument is a function that is used to match the source array (notice Bootstrap calls the "matcher" you provided when you initialized it). What you could do is set the source to a dummy one-element array and define the matcher as a function with an AJAX call in it. That way, it will run the AJAX call just once (since your source array only has one element in it).This solution is not only hacky, but it will suffer from performance issues since the TypeAhead code is designed to do a lookup on every key press (AJAX calls should really only happen on every few keystrokes or after a certain amount of idle time). My advice is to give it a try, but stick with either a different autocomplete library or only use this for non-AJAX situations if you run into any problems.when using ajax, try $.getJSON() instead of $.get() if you have trouble with the correct display of the results.In my case i got only the first character of every result when i used $.get(), although i used json_encode() server-side.
