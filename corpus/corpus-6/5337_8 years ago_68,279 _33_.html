I have two working branches, master and forum and I\'ve just made some modifications in forum branch, that I\'d like to cherry-pick into master. But unfortunately, the commit I want to cherry-pick also contains some modifications that I don\'t want.The solution would probably be to somehow delete the wrong commit and replace it with two separate commits, one with changes I want to pick in master, and others that doesn\'t belong there.I\'ve tried doingwhich deleted all changes, so I had to go back withSo my question is, what is the best way to split last commit into two separate commits?You should use the index. After doing a mixed reset ("git reset HEAD^"), add\nthe first set of changes into the index, then commit them. Then commit the\nrest.You can use "git add" to put all changes made in a file to the index. If you\ndon\'t want to stage every modification made in a file, only some of them, you\ncan use "git add -p".Let\'s see an example. Let\'s suppose I had a file called myfile, which contains\nthe following text:I modified it in my last commit so that now it looks like this:Now I decide that I want to split it into two, and I want the insertion of the\nfirst line to be in the first commit, and the insertion of the last line to be\nin the second commit.First I go back to HEAD\'s parent, but I want to keep the modifications in file system,\nso I use "git reset" without argument (which will do a so-called "mixed"\nreset):Now I use "git add -p" to add the changes I want to commit to the index (=I\nstage them). "git add -p" is an interactive tool that asks you about what\nchanges to the file should it add to the index.Then I commit this first change:Now I can commit all the other changes (namely the numeral "2" put in the last line):Let\'s check the log to see what commits we have:The rebase steps (1 & 7) can be skipped if the splitme is the most recent commit.If I wanted the split files to be committed first, I\'d then rebase -i again and switch the orderTo change the current commit into two commits, you can do something like the following.Either:This undoes the last commit but leaves everything staged. You can then unstage certain files:Optionally restage parts of those files:Make a new first commit:The stage and commit the rest of the changes in a second commit:Or:Undo and unstage all of the changes from the last commit:Selectively stage the first round of changes:Commit:Commit the rest of the changes:(In either step, if you undid a commit that added a brand new file and want to add this to the second commit you\'ll have to manually add it as commit -a only stages changes to already tracked files.)Run git gui, select the "Amend last commit" radio button, and unstage (Commit > Unstage From Commit, or Ctrl-U) changes that you do not want to go into first commit. I think that\'s the easiest way to go about it.Another thing you could do is cherry-pick the change without committing (git cherry-pick -n) and then either manually or with git gui select desired changes before committing.the --hard is what\'s killing your changes.I\'m surprised nobody suggested git cherry-pick -n forum. This will stage the changes from the latest forum commit but not commit them - you can then reset away the changes you don\'t need and commit what you want to keep.
