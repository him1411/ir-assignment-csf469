My blog is hosted on Blogger and I frequently post code snippets in C / C# / Java / XML etc. but I find the snippet gets "mangled".Are there any web sites that I could use to parse the snippet beforehand and sort out the formatting, convert XML "<" to "&lt;" etc.There are a numbers of questions around this area on SO but I couldn\'t find any that address this question directly.Edit: For @Rich answer, site states "To display the formatted code on your site, you need to get this CSS stylesheet, and add a reference to it in the <head> section of your page". That\'s the problem - you can\'t do this on Blogger AFAIK.I\'ve created a blog post entry which explains how to add code syntax highlighting to blogger using the syntaxhighlighter 2.0Here\'s my blog post:http://www.craftyfella.com/2010/01/syntax-highlighting-with-blogger-engine.htmlI hope it helps you guys.. I\'m quite impressed with what it can do.Easiest way to share code is with a public gist.  Just write one up and paste in the embed code. Easy peasy.http://gist.github.comTo address the search engine issue, one can use hidden div on the page as simple as:For my blog I use http://hilite.me/ to format source code. It supports lots of formats and outputs rather clean html. But if you have lots of code snippets then you have to do a lot of copy paste. For formatting Python code I\'ve also used Pygments (blog post).This css script might be useful to all - It is not for syntax highlighting but works well for presenting the source code in original format :How to use :BENEFITS : Simple and easy to use, less configuration, easy to reconfigure, no extra softwareThis can be done fairly easily with SyntaxHighlighter.  I have step-by-step instructions for setting up SyntaxHighlighter in Blogger on my blog.  SyntaxHighlighter is very easy to use. It lets you post snippets in raw form and then wrap them in pre blocks like:Just change the brush name to "python" or "java" or "javascript" and paste in the code of your choice.  The CDATA tagging let\'s you put pretty much any code in there without worrying about entity escaping or other typical annoyances of code blogging.1.  First, take backup of your blogger template\n2.  After that open your blogger template (In Edit HTML mode) & copy the all css   given in this link before </b:skin> tag\n3.  Paste the followig code before </head> tag4.  Paste the following code before </body> tag.5.  Save Blogger Template.\n6.  Now syntax highlighting is ready to use you can use it with <pre></pre> tag.7.  You can Escape your code here.\n8. Here is list of supported language for <class> attribute.Here\'s one site that will format your code and spit out html, and it even includes inline styles for syntax coloring.  Might not work for all of your needs, but is a good start.  I believe he has made the source available if you want to extend it:http://formatmysourcecode.blogspot.co.uk/\nworks fine, you just copy , format, paste back.I have created a tool that gets the job done. You can find it on my blog:Free Online C# Code ColorizerBesides colorizing your C# code, the tool also takes care of all the \'<\' and \'>\' symbols convering them to \'&lt;\' and \'&ampgt;\'. Tabs are converted to spaces in order to look the same in different browsers. You can even make the colorizer inline the CSS styles, in case you cannot or you do not want to insert a CSS style sheet in you blog or website.I use SyntaxHighlighter with my Blogger powered blog. The actual site is hosted on my own server rather than Blogger\'s though (Blogger has an option of ftping posts to your own site), but having your own domain and web hosting only costs a couple of dollars a month.It looks like there have been some changes with SyntaxHighlighter 2.0 that make it easier to use with Blogger. There are hosted versions of the styles and Javascripts at: http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/Actually I had used (what else ;-) ) Vim for this: it has a 2html "plugin". See the docs here.So as I edit my code, I just convert it to HTML and paste the results to Blogger\'s HTML editor. Note: it\'s not so beautiful HTML (embeded css would be better), but it just works.Oh: and it has syntax files for several languages which makes it pretty useful.I use a fairly low tech solution. I format the code using this online syntax highlighting tool then just paste it into the blogEmacs specific answer : As far as blogger is concerned, it allows inline css. The problem with javascript based highlighters is that you have to live with their color scheme or implement your own. But, like me, if you are a fan of your own emacs color scheme, you have a much better option available. I have hacked up the "htmlize.el" package for emacs to add the following four functions...These functions will output copy-paste ready html (inline styled) in a new buffer in emacs, which you can directly use in your blog post. The output looks exactly same as you would see the code in emacs (including the color scheme).Here is a link to my blog, where you can find detailed information of how to use the "blog-htmlize.el" with emacs. This does away with html-encoding the "less than" and "greater than" signs also. And as emacs is doing all the highlighting and styling, you do not have to worry about whether the js library supports the language of your snippets, nor do you have to meddle with your template code in blogger.You can find the elisp file here (save the file as blog-htmlize.el)I rolled my own in F# (see this question), but it still isn\'t perfect (I just do regexps, so I don\'t recognise classes or method names etc.).Basically, from what I can tell, the blogger editor will sometimes eat your angle brackets if you switch between Compose and HTML mode. So you have to paste into HTML mode then save directly. (I may be wrong on this, just tried now and it seems to work - browser dependent?)It\'s horrible when you have generics!To post your html, javascript,c# and java you should convert special characters to HTML code. as \'<\' as &lt; and \'>\' to  &gt; and e.t.c..Add this link Code Converter to iGoogle. This will help you to convert the special characters.Then add SyntaxHighlighter 3.0.83 new version to customize your code in blogger. But you should know How to configure the syntaxHighlighter in your blogger template.
