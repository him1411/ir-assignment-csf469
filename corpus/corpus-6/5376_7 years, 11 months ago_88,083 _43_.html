I\'m struggling to determine how to design restful URLs.  I\'m all for the restful approach of using URLs with nouns and not verbs don\'t understand how to do this.We are creating a service to implement a financial calculator.  The calculator takes a bunch of parameters that we will upload via a CSV file.  The use cases would involve:I gather the restful approach would be to have the following type URLs:You could achieve the first three use cases with:But how do you do the 4th and 5th use case without a verb?  Wouldn\'t you need URLs like:??Perhaps something like:General principles for good URI design:(Note: I did not say "RESTful URI design"; URIs are essentially opaque in REST.)General principles for HTTP method choice:General principles of web service design with HTTP:With regard to your specific question, POST should be used for #4 and #5.  These operations fall under the "RPC-like" guideline above.  For #5, remember that POST does not necessarily have to use Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  This could just as easily be a JSON or CSV payload.Whenever it looks like you need a new verb, think about turning that verb into a noun instead. For example, turn \'activate\' into \'activation\', and \'validate\' into \'validation\'.But just from what you\'ve written I\'d say your application has much bigger problems.Any time a resource called \'parameter\' is proposed, it should send up red flags in every project team member\'s mind. \'parameter\' can literally apply to any resource; it\'s not specific enough.What exactly does a \'parameter\' represent? Probably a number of different things, each of which should have a separate resource dedicated to it.Another way to get at this - when you discuss your application with end users (those who presumably know little about programming) what are the words they themselves use repeatedly?Those are the words you should be designing your application around.If you haven\'t yet had this conversion with prospective users - stop everything right now and don\'t write another line of code until you do! Only then will your team have an idea of what needs to be built.I know nothing about financial software, but if I had to guess, I\'d say some of the resources might go by names such as "Report", "Payment", "Transfer", and "Currency".There are a number of good books on this part of the software design process. Two I can recommend are Domain Driven Design and Analysis Patterns.The design of your urls has nothing to do with whether your application is RESTful or not. the phrase "RESTful URLS" is therefore nonsense. I think you should do some more reading on what REST actually is. REST treats the URLS as opaque, and as such doesn\'t know what\'s in them, whether theres verbs or nouns or whatever. You might still want to design your URLS, but that\'s about UI, not REST.That said, lets get to your question: The last two cases are not RESTful, and don\'t fit into any kind of restful scheme. Those are what you might call RPC. If you\'re serious about REST you\'ll have to rethink how your application works from the ground up. Either that, or abandon REST and just do your app as an RPC app.Hrmmm maybe not.The idea here is that you have to treat everything as a resource, so once a set of parameters has a URL you can refer to it from, you just addget [parametersurl]/validationresultspost [paramatersurl]body: {command:"activate"}but again, that activate thing is RPC, not REST.The activate and validate requirements are situations where you are attempting to change the state of a resource.  It is no different that making an order "completed", or some other request "submitted".  There are numerous ways to model these kinds of state change but one that I find that often works is to create collection resources for resources of the same state and then to move the resource between the collections to affect the state.  e.g.  Create some resources such as,If you want to make a set of parameters active, then add that set to the ActiveParameters collection.  You could either pass the set of parameters as an entity body, or you could pass an url as a query parameter, as follows:The same thing can be done with the /ValidatedParameters.  If the Parameters are not valid then the server can return "Bad Request" to the request to add the parameters to collection of validated parameters.I would suggest the following Meta resource and methods.Make parameters active and/or validate them:Check if the parameters are active and valid:In a REST environment, each URL is a unique resource. What are your resources? A financial calculator really doesn\'t have any obvious resources. You need to dig into what you are calling parameters and pull out the resources. For example, an amortization calendar for a loan might be a resource. The URL for the calendar might include start_date, term (in months or yers), period (when interest is compounded), interest rate, and initial principle. With all those values you have a specific calendar of payments:Now, I don\'t know what you are calculating but your concept of a parameter list doesn\'t sound RESTful. As someone else said, your requirements above sound more XMLRPC. If you are trying for REST you need nouns. Calculations are not nouns, they are verb that act on nouns. You need to turn it around to pull the nouns out of your calcs.Edit: Indeed the URI would have prevented GET requests from remaining idempotent. For the validation however, the use of HTTP status codes to notify the validity of a request (to create a new or modify an existing \'parameter\') would fit a Restful model. Report back with a 400 Bad Request status code if the data submitted is/are invalid and the request must be altered before being resubmitted (HTTP/1.1 Status Codes).This relies on validating at submission time though, rather than deferring it as in your use-case. The other answers have suitable solutions to that scenario.
