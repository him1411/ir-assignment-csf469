I already tried all the possible ways, but I still didn\'t get it working.\nI have a modal window with a checkbox I want that when the modal opens, the checkbox check or uncheck should be based on a database value. (I have that already working with others form fields.) I started trying to get it checked but it didn\'t work.My html div:and the jquery:I also tried with attr, and others seen here in the forums, but none seem to work.\nCan someone point me the right way?EDIT:\nok, I\'m really missing something here... I can check/uncheck using code if the check box is in the page, but is it\'s in the modal window, I can\'t. I tried dozens of different ways...I have a link that\'s supposed to open the modal:\nand jquery to "listen" the click and execute some operations like filling some text boxes with data coming from database. Everything works like I want but the problem is that I can\'t set checkbox checked/unchecked using code. help please!you have to use the \'prop\' function : Before jQuery 1.6 (see user2063626\'s answer):Taking all of the proposed answers and applying them to my situation - trying to check or uncheck a checkbox based on a retrieved value of true (should check the box) or false (should not check the box) - I tried all of the above and found that using .prop("checked", true) and .prop("checked", false) were the correct solution.I can\'t add comments or up answers yet, but I felt this was important enough to add to the conversation. Here is the longhand code for a fullcalendar modification that says if the retrieved value "allDay" is true, then check the checkbox with ID "even_allday_yn":Dude try below code :OR ORSince you are in a modal window (whether dynamic or in the page) you can use the following code to accomplish your goal: (I ran into the same problem on my site and this is how I fixed it)HTML:CODE:In the above "kendoWindow" is my window (mine is dynamic, but I also do this when appending to an element directly in the page). I am looping through an array of data ("queriesToAddToGroup") to see if any rows have an attribute of COPY. If so I want to turn on the checkbox within the window that sets that attribute when a user saves from this window.will work.Make sure true and false are not inside quotes."checked" attribute \'ticks\' the checkbox as soon as it exists. So to check/uncheck a checkbox you have to set/unset the attribute.For checking the box:For unchecking the box:For testing the checked status:Hope it helps...You can write like below given code.HTMLjQueryHope it work for you.Find will return array , so use [0] to get even if there is only one itemif you don\'t use find thenthis worked fine in Mozilla Firefox for meWorked for me:Try this since your are using jQuery UI probably (if not please comment)Have you tried running $("#estado_cat").checkboxradio("refresh") on your checkbox?This works.This occurs because you with the newest version of jquery attr(\'checked\') returns \'checked\' while prop(\'checked\') returns true.I encountered this problem too.and here is my old doesn\'t work codehere is my new code which is worked now:so,the key point is before it worked ,make sure the checked property does exist and does not been removed.Set the check box after loading the modal window. I think you are setting the check box before loading the page.
