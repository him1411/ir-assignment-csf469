I think this is a very basic question but I\'m not sure how it can be done.What I want to do is when a certain div is hovered, it\'d affect the properties of another div.For example, in this simple example, when you hover over #cube it changes the background-color but what I want is that when I hover over #container, #cubeis affected.If the cube is directly inside the container:If cube is next to (after containers closing tag) the container:If the cube is somewhere inside the container:If the cube is a sibling of the container:In this particular example, you can use:This only works since cube is a child of container. For more complicated scenarios, you\'d need to use javascript.Using the sibling selector is the general solution for styling other elements when hovering over a given one, but it works only if the other elements follow the given one in the DOM. What can we do when the other elements should actually be before the hovered one? Say we want to implement a signal bar rating widget like the one below:This can actually be done easily using the CSS flexbox model, by setting flex-direction to reverse, so that the elements are displayed in the opposite order from the one they\'re in the DOM. The screenshot above is from such a widget, implemented with pure CSS.Flexbox is very well supported by 95% of modern browsers.Big thanks to Mike and Robertc for their helpful posts!If you have two elements in your HTML and you want to :hover over one and target a style change in the other the two elements must be directly related--parents, children or siblings. This means that the two elements either must be one inside the other or must both be contained within the same larger element. I wanted to display definitions in a box on the right side of the browser as my users read through my site and :hover over highlighted terms; therefore, I did not want the \'definition\' element to be displayed inside the \'text\' element.I almost gave up and just added javascript to my page, but this is the future dang it! We should not have to put up with back sass from CSS and HTML telling us where we have to place our elements to achieve the effects we want! In the end we compromised.While the actual HTML elements in the file must be either nested or contained in a single element to be valid :hover targets to each other, the css position attribute can be used to display any element where ever you want. I used position:fixed to place the target of my :hover action where I wanted it on the user\'s screen regardless to its location in the HTML document.The html:The css:In this example the target of a :hover command from an element within #explainBox must either be #explainBox or also within #explainBox. The position attributes assigned to #definitions force it to appear in the desired location (outside #explainBox) even though it is technically located in an unwanted position within the HTML document.I understand it is considered bad form to use the same #id for more than one HTML element; however, in this case the instances of #light can be described independently due to their respective positions in uniquely #id\'d elements. Is there any reason not to repeat the id #light in this case?Only this worked for me:Where .cube is CssClass of the #cube.Tested in Firefox, Chrome and Edge.
