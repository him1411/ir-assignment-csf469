This question already has an answer here:Is there a built-in function for getting the size of a file object in bytes? I see some people do something like this:But from my experience with Python, it has a lot of helper functions so I\'m guessing maybe there is one built-in.Try to take a look at http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#os.path.getsizeos.path.getsize(path) Return the size,\n  in bytes, of path. Raise os.error if\n  the file does not exist or is\n  inaccessible.OR Return the size, in bytes, of path. Raise os.error if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.You may use os.stat(), which is a wrapper of system call stat():Try It should return the size of a file, reported by os.stat().You can use os.stat(path) callhttp://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.stat
