I need something like:You can also do it using -v option of grep as:grep -v "unwanted_word" file will filter the lines that have the unwanted_word and grep XXXXXXXX will list only lines with pattern XXXXXXXX.EDIT:From your comment it looks like you want to list all lines without the unwanted_word. In that case all you need is:I understood the question as "How do I match a word but exclude another", for which one solution is two greps in series: First grep finding the wanted "word1", second grep excluding "word2":In my case: I need to differentiate between "plot" and "#plot" which grep\'s "word" option won\'t do ("#" not being a alphanumerical).Hope this helps.If your grep supports Perl regular expression with -P option you can do (if bash; if tcsh you\'ll need to escape the !):Demo:Let us now list all foo except foo3The right solution is to use grep -v "word" file, with its awk equivalent:However, if you happen to have a more complex situation in which you want, say, XXX to appear and YYY not to appear, then awk comes handy instead of piping several greps:You can even say something more complex. For example: I want those lines containing either XXX or YYY, but not ZZZ:etc.Invert match using grep -v:The -v option will show you all the lines that don\'t match the pattern.grep provides \'-v\' or \'--invert-match\' option to select non-matching lines.e.g. This will output all the lines from file file_name, which does not have \'unwanted_pattern\'.If you are searching the pattern in multiple files inside a folder, you can use the recursive search option as followsHere grep will try to list all the occurrences of \'wanted_pattern\' in all the files from within currently directory and pass it to second grep to filter out the \'unwanted_pattern\'. \n\'|\' - pipe will tell shell to connect the standard output of left program (grep -r \'wanted_pattern\' *) to standard input of right program (grep -v \'unwanted_pattern\').I\'ve a directory with a bunch of files. I want to find all the files that DO NOT contain the string "speedup" so I successfully used the following command:
