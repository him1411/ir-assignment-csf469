I am using Fedora 14 and I have MySQL and MySQL server 5.1.42 installed and running.\nNow I tried to do this as root user:But I get this error:What\'s wrong here? In installed ruby 1.8.7. and the latest rubygems 1.3.7.For those who may be confused by the accepted answer, as I was, you also need to have the ruby headers installed [ruby-devel].The article that saved my hide is here.And this is the revised solution (note that I\'m on Fedora 13):For Debian, and other distributions using Debian style packaging the ruby development headers are installed by:For Ubuntu  the ruby development headers are installed by:If you are using a earlier version of ruby (such as 2.2), then you will need to run:(where 2.2 is your desired Ruby version)Red Hat, Fedora:Debian, Ubuntu:Arch Linux:For anyone reading this in 2015: if you happened to install the package ruby2.0, you need to install the matching ruby2.0-dev to get the appropriate Ruby headers. The same goes for ruby2.1 and ruby2.2, etc. For example:it seems that thewas enough for me to performafterwards.It\'s possible that you will need to install another packages:to be able to build native extensionsThis post helped me. Thanks a lot.On Linux (Ubuntu 12.10) I needed to runbefore I could succesfully runI found the solution here.If you have gem installed and ruby and not able to install rails. Then install ruby dev lib.It works for me. I have tried the different solution. Red Hat, Fedora:MAC users may face this issue when xcode tools are not installed properly.\nBelow is the command to get rid of the issue.This command solved the problem for me!My initial solution was to resolve the above errors by installing ruby-devel, patch and rubygems. My issue was a bit different as bcrypt 3.1.11 still had issues compiling and installing on Fedora 23. I needed additional packages. So after ensuring I had the above installed, I was still having issues:gcc: error: conftest.c: No such file or directorygcc: error: /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-hardened-cc1: No such file or directoryFrom here I had to do the following:I ensured that I wasn\'t lacking any C compiler tools sudo dnf group install "C Development Tools and Libraries"Then I ran sudo dnf install redhat-rpm-config to resolve the gcc issue listed above.You can find a write up here on Fedore Project. You may also find answers to other needs as well.in openSUSE:Works to me :)It\'s necessary to install redhat-rpm-config to. I guess it solve your problem!For those that are still experiencing problems, like I have(I am using Ubuntu 16.04), I had to put in the following commands in order to get some gems like bcrypt, pg, and others installed.  They are all similar to the ones above except for one.This allowed me to install gems like, PG, bcrypt, and recaptcha.Just to add path to ruby.h file in my PATH\nfor example: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/src/ruby-xxxxxx
