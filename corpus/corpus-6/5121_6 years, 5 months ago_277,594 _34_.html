How do I detect when one of the arrow keys are pressed? I used this to find out:Though it worked for every other key, it didn\'t for arrow keys (maybe because the browser is supposed to scroll on these keys by default).arrow keys are only triggered by onkeydown, not onkeypresskeycodes are:On key up and down call function. There are different codes for each key.Possibly the tersest formulation:Demo (thanks to user Angus Grant): http://jsfiddle.net/angusgrant/E3tE6/This should work cross-browser.  Leave a comment if there is a browser where it does not work.There are other ways to get the key code (e.which, e.charCode, and window.event instead of e), but they should not be necessary.  You can try most of them out at http://www.asquare.net/javascript/tests/KeyCode.html. \nNote that event.keycode does not work with onkeypress in Firefox, but it does work with onkeydown.Use keydown, not keypress for non-printable keys such as arrow keys:The best JavaScript key event reference I\'ve found (beating the pants off quirksmode, for example) is here: http://unixpapa.com/js/key.htmlMore recent and much cleaner: use event.key. No more arbitrary number codes! If you are transpiling or know your users are all on modern browsers, use this!Mozilla DocsSupported BrowsersP.S. event.code is the same for arrowsHere\'s an example implementation:Here\'s how I did it:Edit:I forgot, the if statements need to be put into a loop that is constantly running.I\'ve been able to trap them with jQuery:An example: http://jsfiddle.net/AjKjU/That is the working code for chrome and firefox Modern answer since keyCode is now deprecated in favor of key:I was also looking for this answer until I came across this post.I\'ve found another solution to know the keycode of the different keys, courtesy to my problem.  I just wanted to share my solution.Just use keyup/keydown event to write the value in the console/alert the same using event.keyCode. like-- rupamThat\'s shorter.function IsArrows (e) {\n   return (e.keyCode >= 37 && e.keyCode <= 40); \n}Re answers that you need keydown not keypress. Assuming you want to move something continuously while the key is pressed, I find that keydown works for all browsers except Opera. For Opera, keydown only triggers on 1st press. To accommodate Opera use:This library rocks!\nhttps://craig.is/killing/miceYou need to press the sequence a bit fast to highlight the code in that page though.control the Key codes %=37 and &=38... and only arrow keys left=37  up=38
