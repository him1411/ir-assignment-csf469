I have this text input in a form:I am trying to get it to take multiple lines of input. The width and height make the box to be bigger, but the user can enter text all (s)he wants yet it fills one line only. How do I make the input more like a textarea?You need to use a textarea to get multiline handling.It is possible to make a text-input multi-line by giving it the word-break: break-word; attribute. (Only tested this in Chrome)You can\'t. The only HTML form element that\'s designed to be multi-line is <textarea>.Use the textarea don\'t leave any space between the opening and closing tags Or Else This will leave some empty lines or spaces.Check this:The  TEXTAREA element creates a \n  multi-line text input control
