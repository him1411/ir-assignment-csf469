I really haven\'t found normal example of PHP file where MySQL transactions are being used. Can you show me simple example of that? And one more question. I\'ve already done a lot of programming and didn\'t use transactions. Can I put a PHP function or something in header.php that if one mysql_query fails, then the others fail too?I think I have figured it out, is it right?:The idea I generally use when working with transactions looks like this (semi-pseudo-code):\nNote that, with this idea, if a query fails, an Exception must be thrown:\nUnfortunately, there is no magic involved. You cannot just put an instruction somewhere and have transactions done automatically: you still have to specific which group of queries must be executed in a transaction.For example, quite often you\'ll have a couple of queries before the transaction (before the begin) and another couple of queries after the transaction (after either commit or rollback) and you\'ll want those queries executed no matter what happened (or not) in the transaction.I think I have figured it out, is it right?:As this is the first result on google for "php mysql transaction", I thought I\'d add an answer that explicitly demonstrates how to do this with mysqli (as the original author wanted examples). Here\'s a simplified example of transactions with PHP/mysqli:Also, keep in mind that PHP 5.5 has a new method mysqli::begin_transaction. However, this has not been documented yet by the PHP team, and I\'m still stuck in PHP 5.3, so I can\'t comment on it.Please check which storage engine you are using. If it is MyISAM, then Transaction(\'COMMIT\',\'ROLLBACK\') will not be supported because only the InnoDB storage engine, not MyISAM, supports transactions.I made a function to get a vector of queries and do a transaction, maybe someone will find out it useful:I had this, but not sure if this is correct. Could try this out also.Idea from here: http://www.phpknowhow.com/mysql/transactions/One more procedural style example with mysqli_multi_query, assumes $query is filled with semicolon-separated statements.When using PDO connection:I often use the following code for transaction management:Usage example:This way the transaction-management code is not duplicated across the project. Which is a good thing, because, judging from other PDO-ralated answers in this thread, it\'s easy to make mistakes in it. The most common ones being forgetting to rethrow the exception and starting the transaction inside the try block.
