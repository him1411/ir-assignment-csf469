Is there any difference between ::: and ++ for concatenating lists in Scala?From the documentation it looks like ++ is more general whereas ::: is List-specific. Is the latter provided because it\'s used in other functional languages?Legacy. List was originally defined to be functional-languages-looking:Of course, Scala evolved other collections, in an ad-hoc manner. When 2.8 came out, the collections were redesigned for maximum code reuse and consistent API, so that you can use ++ to concatenate any two collections -- and even iterators. List, however, got to keep its original operators, aside from one or two which got deprecated.::: works only with lists, while ++ can be used with any traversable. In the current implementation (2.9.0), ++ falls back on ::: if the argument is also a List.Always use :::. There are two reasons: efficiency and type safety.Efficiencyx ::: y ::: z is faster than x ++ y ++ z, because ::: is right associative. x ::: y ::: z is parsed as x ::: (y ::: z), which is algorithmically faster than (x ::: y) ::: z (the latter requires O(|x|) more steps).Type safetyWith ::: you can only concatenate two Lists. With ++ you can append any collection to List, which is terrible:++ is also easy to mix up with +:A different point is that the first sentence is parsed as:Whereas the second example is parsed as:So if you are using macros, you should take care.Besides, ++ for two lists is calling ::: but with more overhead because it is asking for an implicit value to have a builder from List to List. But microbenchmarks did not prove anything useful in that sense, I guess that the compiler optimizes such calls.Micro-Benchmarks after warming up.As Daniel C. Sobrai said, you can append the content of any collection to a list using ++, whereas with ::: you can only concatenate lists.
