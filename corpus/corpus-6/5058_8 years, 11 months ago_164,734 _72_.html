I\'d love to create a "back" left-arrow-bezel button in a UIToolbar.As far as I can tell, the only way to get one of these is to leave UINavigationController at default settings and it uses one for the left bar item. But there\'s no way I can find to create one as a UIBarButtonItem, so I can\'t make one in a standard UIToolbar, even though they\'re very similar to UINavigationBars.I could manually create it with button images, but I can\'t find the source images anywhere. They have alpha-channel edges, so screenshotting and cutting won\'t get very versatile results.Any ideas beyond screenshotting for every size and color scheme I intend to use?Update: PLEASE STOP dodging the question and suggesting that I shouldn\'t be asking this and should be using UINavigationBar. My app is Instapaper Pro. It shows only a bottom toolbar (to save space and maximize readable content area), and I wish to put a left-arrow-shaped Back button in the bottom.Telling me that I shouldn\'t need to do this is not an answer and certainly doesn\'t deserve a bounty.I used the following psd that I derived from http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/?p=447http://www.chrisandtennille.com/pictures/backbutton.psdI then just created a custom UIView that I use in the customView property of the toolbar item.Works well for me.Edit: As pointed out by PrairieHippo, maralbjo found that using the following, simple code did the trick (requires custom image in bundle) should be combined with this answer. So here is additional code:I think it is much easier to just use a unicode character to get the job done. You can look through arrows by googling either Unicode Triangles or Unicode Arrows. Starting with iOS6 Apple changed the character to be an emoji character with a border. To disable the border I add the 0xFE0E Unicode Variation Selector. The code block is just for the demo. It would work in any button that accepts an NSString.For a full list of characters search Google for Unicode character and what you want. Here is the entry for Black Left-Pointing Triangle.WARNING: There are reports that this will not work on iOS 6. This might only work on older versions of the OS. Evidently at least one dev has had their app rejected for using this trick (see the comments). Use at your own risk. Using an image (see answer above) might be a safer solution.This can be done without adding in your own image files using sekr1t button type 101 to get the correct shape. For me the trick was figuring out that I could use \'initWithCustomView\' to create the Bar Button Item. I personally needed this for a dynamic navbar rather than a toolbar, but I tested it with a toolbar and the code is nearly the same:If you\'re doing this on a toolbar you\'ll have to tweak how you set the items, but that depends on the rest of your code and I leave that as an exercise for the reader. :P This sample worked for me (compiled & run).Blah blah, read the HIG, don\'t use undocumented features, and all that. There\'s only six supported button types and this isn\'t one of them.First of all you have to find an image of the back button. I used a nice app called Extractor that extracts all the graphics from iPhone.\nIn iOS7 I managed to retrieve the image called UINavigationBarBackIndicatorDefault and it was in black colour, since I needed a red tint I change the colour to red using Gimp.EDIT: As was mentioned by btate in his comment, there is no need to change the color with the image editor. The following code should do the trick:Then I created a view that contains an imageView with that arrow, a label with the custom text and on top of the view I have a button with an action. Then I added a simple animation (fading and translation).The following code simulates the behaviour of the back button including animation.EDIT:Instead of adding the button, in my opinion the better approach is to use a gesture recognizer. I\'m not sure if this would work, but you could try creating a UINavigationController with the default settings to create the button, find the button in the navigation controller\'s subview hierarchy, call removeFromSuperview on it, destroy the navigation controller, and then add the button as a subview of your toolbar.  You may also need to retain and the button before calling removeFromSuperview (and then release it after adding it as subview of your toolbar) to avoid it being deallocated during the process.To make a UIButton with an arrow pretty close (I\'m not a designer ;) to the iOS 7 system back arrow:Standard:  Apple SD Gothic NeoIn Xcode:Ref @staticVoidMan\'s answer to Back-like arrow on iOS 7If you don\'t want to bother with image files, the arrow shape can be drawn in a UIView subclass with the following code:where the arrow view is proportional to a width of 6.0 and a height of 10.0Works for me. I used this when I had more tabs then could fit on the tab bar, and a view controller pushed from the "More" overrode the leftBarButtonItem in its viewDidLoad.You can find the source images by extracting them from Other.artwork in UIKit ${SDKROOT}/System/Library/Frameworks/UIKit.framework/Other.artwork. The modding community has some tools for extracting them, here. Once you extract the image you can write some code to recolor it as necessary and set it as the button image. Whether or not you can actually ship such a thing (since you are embedding derived artwork) might be a little dicey, so maybe you want to talk to a lawyer.The Three20 library has a way to do this:I found that using the following, simple code did the trick (requires custom image in bundle): Here\'s what I ended up doing after searching through all these solutions and others. It uses a stretchable png\'s extracted from the UIKit stock images. This way you can set the text to whatever you liekIt\'s easy to do with Interface Builder in Xcode 5.x use Toolbar and Bar Button Item from Object library in button\'s Attributes inspector edit Image section \nwith your back button imageDone!I was trying to do the same thing, but I wanted the back button to be in the navigation bar. (I actually needed a back button, that would do more than only going back, so I had to use the leftBarButtonItem property). I tried what AndrewS suggested, but in the navigation bar it wouldn\'t look the way it should, as the UIButton was kind of casted to a UIBarButtonItem.But I found a way to work around this. I actually just put a UIView under the UIButton and set the customView for the UIBarButtonItem. Here is the code, if somebody needs it:To create an image for the UIToolbar, make a png in photoshop and WHERE EVER there is ANY colour it puts it white, and where it\'s alpha = 0 then it leaves it alone.The SDK actually put\'s the border around the icon you have made and turns it white without you having to do anything.See, this is what I made in Photoshop for my forward button (obviously swap it around for back button):http://twitpic.com/1oanvand this is what it appeared like in Interface Builderhttp://twitpic.com/1oaoaSolution WITHOUT using a png. Based on this SO answer: Adding the little arrow to the right side of a cell in an iPhone TableView CellJust flipping the UITableViewCell horizontally!If you want to avoid drawing it yourself, you could use the undocumented class: UINavigationButton with style 1. This could, of course, stop your application from being approved...\n/JohnWell, you don\'t have to have a different button for every size,  you can use [UIImage stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:topCapHeight:], but the only thing I\'ve found is custom images.I had a similar problem, and come out one library PButton. And the sample is the back navigation button like button, which can be used anywhere just like  a customized button. Something like this:\nExample in Swift 3, with a previous and a next button in the top right.Swift Try this. I am sure you do not need a back button image to create one such.That\'s all you have to do :)Why are you doing this? If you want something that looks like a navigation bar, use UINavigationBar.Toolbars have specific visual style associated with them. The Human Interface Guidelines for the iPhone state:A toolbar appears at the bottom edge of the screen and contains buttons that perform actions related to objects in the current view.It then gives several visual examples of roughly square icons with no text. I would urge you to follow the HIG on this.
