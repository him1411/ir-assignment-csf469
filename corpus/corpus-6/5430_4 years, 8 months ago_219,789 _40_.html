I have two branches namely master and development in a GitHub Repository. I am doing all my  development in development branch as shown.Now I want to merge all the changes on the development branch into the master. My current approach is:Please let me know if the procedure I am following is correct.I generally like to merge master into the development first so that if there are any conflicts, I can resolve in the development branch itself and my master remains clean.There isn\'t much of a difference in the two approaches, but I have noticed sometimes that I don\'t want to merge the branch into master yet, after merging them, or that there is still more work to be done before these can be merged, so I tend to leave master untouched until final stuff.EDIT: From commentsIf you want to keep track of who did the merge and when, you can use --no-ff flag while merging to do so. This is generally useful only when merging development into the master (last step), because you might need to merge master into development (first step) multiple times in your workflow, and creating a commit node for these might not be very useful.Personally, my approach is similar to your, with a few more branches and some squashing of commits when they go back to master.One of my co-workers doesn\'t like having to switch branches so much and stays on the development branch with something similar to the following all executed from the development branch.The first line makes sure he has any upstream commits that have been made to master since the last time updated his local repository.The second pulls those changes (if any) from master into developmentThe third pushes the development branch (now fully merged with master) up to origin/master.I may have his basic workflow a little wrong, but that is the main gist of it.It would be great if you can use the Git Flow command. It merge develop branch to Master easily.What you want to do is just follow the git flow instruction mention here,http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/steps.Check the above link for more info.Yes, this is correct, but it looks like a very basic workflow, where you\'re just buffering changes before they\'re ready for integration. You should look into more advanced workflows that git supports. You might like the topic branch approach, which lets you work on multiple features in parallel, or the graduation approach which extends your current workflow a bit.on branch development(resolve any merge conflicts if there are any)You need to push the code to master once you are done with merge. This is because merge does commit operation by default but not push.Explanation from the bottom for ones who came here without any knowledge of branches.Basic master branch development logic is: You work only on another branches and use master only to merge another branches.You begin to create a new branch in this way:1) Clone needed repository in your web root:2) Create a new branch. It will contain the latest files of your master branch repository3) Change git branch to the new_branch4) Do coding, commits, as usual\xe2\x80\xa65) When job is finished on this branch, merge with \xe2\x80\x9cmaster\xe2\x80\x9d branch:1) On branch Development, check git status using following command:git statusThere should be no uncommitted code. If it is, push your code on Development branch:git add *git commit -m "My initial commit message"git push origin Development2) On Development branch, run following two commands:git branch -f master HEADgit push -f origin masterIt will push your Development branch code to master branch.
