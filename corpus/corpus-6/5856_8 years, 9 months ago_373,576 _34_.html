How do I use the json_encode() function with MySQL query results? Do I need to iterate through the rows or can I just apply it to the entire results object?The function json_encode needs PHP >= 5.2 and the php-json package - as mentioned hereNOTE: mysql is deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0, use mysqli extension instead http://php.net/manual/en/migration55.deprecated.php.Try this, this will create your object properlyhttp://www.php.net/mysql_query says "mysql_query() returns a resource".http://www.php.net/json_encode says it can encode any value "except a resource".You need to iterate through and collect the database results in an array, then json_encode the array.Thanks this helped me a lot. My code:The above will not work, in my experience, before you name the root-element \nin the array to something, I have not been able to access anything in the \nfinal json before that.That should do the trick!P\xc3\xa4rThanks.. my answer goes:The code below works fine here!My simple fix to stop it putting speech marks around numeric values...Sorry, this is extremely long after the question, but:Just basically:How to create JSON using data from MySQL databaseJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is more preferred nowadays over XML as it\xe2\x80\x99s lightweight, readable and easily manageable for exchanging data across various platforms. \nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll see how JSON Data can be created from Employee table stored in MySQL database. Live : [Example ]aarray_push($rows,$row_array); help to build array otherwise it give last value in the while loopthis work like append method of StringBuilder in javaOne more option using FOR loop:The only disadvantage is that loop for is slower then e.g. while or especially foreachFor example\n$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM userprofiles where NAME=\'TESTUSER\' ");1.) if $result is only one row.2.) if $result is more than one row. You need to iterate the rows and save it to an array and return a json with array in it.we could simplify Paolo Bergantino answer like thisI solved like this as simple as that :-)I have the same requirement. I just want to print a result object into JSON format so I use the code below. I hope you find something in it.Code:Check the code below for using mysql_fetch and json_encode. You will need to iterate through the rows but if you use mysqli the situation will change
