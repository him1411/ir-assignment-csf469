How do I get the id of my Java process? I know there are several platform-dependent hacks, but I\'d prefer a more generic solution.There exists no platform-independent way that can be guaranteed to work in all jvm implementations.\nManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getName() looks like the best (closest) solution. It\'s short, and probably works in every implementation in wide use.On linux+windows it returns a value like 12345@hostname (12345 being the process id). Beware though that according to the docs, there are no guarantees about this value:Returns the name representing the running Java virtual machine. The\n  returned name string can be any arbitrary string and a Java virtual\n  machine implementation can choose to embed platform-specific useful\n  information in the returned name string. Each running virtual machine\n  could have a different name.In Java 9 the new process API can be used:You could use JNA. Unfortunately there is no common JNA API to get the current process ID yet, but each platform is pretty simple:Make sure you have jna-platform.jar then:Declare:Then:Under Java 9 the new process API can be used to get the current process ID. First you grab a handle to the current process, then query the PID:Here\'s a backdoor method which might not work with all VMs but should work on both linux and windows (original example here):Try Sigar . very extensive APIs.  Apache 2 license.The following method tries to extract the PID from java.lang.management.ManagementFactory:Just call getProcessId("<PID>"), for instance.You can check out my project: JavaSysMon on GitHub. It provides process id and a bunch of other stuff (CPU usage, memory usage) cross-platform (presently Windows, Mac OSX, Linux and Solaris) For older JVM, in linux...Since Java 9 there is a method Process.getPid() which returns the native ID of a process:To get the process ID of the current Java process one can use the ProcessHandle interface:The latest I have found is that there is a system property called sun.java.launcher.pid that is available at least on linux.  My plan is to use that and if it is not found to use the JMX bean.It depends on where you are looking for the information from.If you are looking for the information from the console you can use the jps command. The command gives output similar to the Unix ps command and comes with the JDK since I believe 1.5If you are looking from the process the RuntimeMXBean (as said by Wouter Coekaerts) is probably your best choice. The output from getName() on Windows using Sun JDK 1.6 u7 is in the form [PROCESS_ID]@[MACHINE_NAME]. You could however try to execute jps and parse the result from that:If run with no options the output should be the process id followed by the name.In Scala:This should give you a workaround on Unix systems until Java 9 will be released.\n(I know, the question was about Java, but since there is no equivalent question for Scala, I wanted to leave this for Scala users who might stumble into the same question.)For completeness there is a wrapper in Spring Boot for the solution. If an integer is required, then this can be summed up to the one-liner:If someone uses Spring boot already, she/he might use org.springframework.boot.ApplicationPidThe toString() method prints the pid or \'???\'.Caveats using the ManagementFactory are discussed in other answers already.Based on Ashwin Jayaprakash\'s answer (+1)\nabout the Apache 2.0 licensed SIGAR, here is how I use it to get only the PID of the current process:Even though it does not work on all platforms, it does work on Linux, Windows, OS X and various Unix platforms as listed here.This is the code JConsole, and potentially jps and VisualVM uses. It utilizes classes from\nsun.jvmstat.monitor.* package, from tool.jar.There are few catches:UPDATE: I have just double checked that JPS uses this way, that is Jvmstat library (part of tool.jar). So there is no need to call JPS as external process, call Jvmstat library directly as my example shows. You can aslo get list of all JVMs runnin on localhost this way.\nSee JPS source code:You can try getpid() in JNR-Posix.  It has a Windows POSIX wrapper that calls getpid() off of libc.I know this is an old thread, but I wanted to call out that API for getting the PID (as well as other manipulation of the Java process at runtime) is being added to the Process class in JDK 9: http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/102Here is my solution:This is what I used when I had similar requirement. This determines the PID of the Java process correctly. Let your java code spawn a server on a pre-defined port number and then execute OS commands to find out the PID listening on the port. For Linux
