I\'m trying to open a dialog window, but every time I try to open it it throws this exception:I\'m creating it by calling showDialog with the display\'s id. The onCreateDialog handler logs fine and I can step through it without an issue, but I\'ve attached it since it seems like I\'m missing something:Is there something missing from this? Some questions have talked about having this problem when creating a dialog from onCreate, which happens because the activity isn\'t created yet, but this is coming from a call from a menu object, and the appContext variable seems like it is correctly populated in the debugger.i.e. this line:\nContext appContext = this.getApplicationContext();\nmust go, and instead you use a pointer to the activity you\'re in (probably this).I got bitten by this today too, the annoying part is the getApplicationContext() is verbatim from developer.android.com :(You cannot display an application window/dialog through a Context that is not an Activity. Try passing a valid activity referenceDitto on the getApplicationContext thing.The documents on the android site says to use it, but it doesn\'t work...grrrrr :-PJust do:"this" is usually your Activity from which you start the dialog.Android documents suggests to use getApplicationContext();but it will not work instead of that use your current activity while instantiating AlertDialog.Builder or AlertDialog or Dialog... Ex:  orInstead of getApplicationContext(), just use ActivityName.thisI had a similar issue where I had another class something like this:Worked fine most of the time, but sometimes it crashed with the same error.  Then I realise that in MyActivity I had...Because I was holding the object as static, a second run of the code was still holding the original version of the object, and thus was still referring to the original Activity, which no long existed.Silly stupid mistake, especially as I really didn\'t need to be holding the object as static in the first place...Just change it intoInstead ofAnother solution is to set the window type to a system dialog:This requires the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission:As the docs say:Very few applications should use this permission; these windows are intended for system-level interaction with the user.This is a solution you should only use if you require a dialog that\'s not attached to an activity.Don\'t use getApplicationContext() on declaring dialougeAlways use this or your activity.this This Worked for me--Use For nested dialogs this issue is very common, It works when is used instead of this alternative.You can also do this This worked for me !! As it\'s said, you need an Activity as context for the dialog, use "YourActivity.this" for a static context or check here for how to use a dynamic one in a safe modeTry to reset dialog window\'s type toDon\'t forget to use the permission android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOWText here:-\nuse this for getting activity context for progressdialogor progressdialog = new ProgressDialog(this); use this for getting application context for BroadcastListener\n     not for progressdialog.The best and the safest way to show a \'ProgressDialog\' in an AsyncTask, avoiding memory leak problem is to use a \'Handler\' with Looper.main().then in the \'onCreate\'Now you r done with the setup part. Now call \'showProgress()\' and \'hideProgress()\' in AsyncTask.
