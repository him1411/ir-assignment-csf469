I use Sublime Text 2 and want a Ruler to be shown in every file with specific line-height. But I have to show it manually in every file.Edit the "rulers" value in the default settings to contain the column number you want the ruler to be displayed on, and it will persist.Go to Sublime Text > Preferences > Settings - UserAdd a "rulers" setting with the lines you want for the ruler:If you want multiple rulers, separate the values with a comma:Rulers not showing? Rulers are only shown when using a monospace font, which is the default font for Sublime Text. Ensure you are using a monospace font if the settings above don\'t work for you.Never edit Settings - Default; edit Settings - User instead. If you upgrade your SublimeText version you will lose all of your settings because Settings - Default will be overwritten.In the Packages folders the \'User/\' folder will be ignored between upgrades of SublimeText, the settings here will be persistent.To enable the persistent rulers in any document, add the settings in Defaults - User:This example will display 3 rulers, at 75, 80 and 85 chars length.As others have stated before me, select Preferences -> Settings-User and change"rulers": [],to"rulers": [80],in order to display one ruler at column 80.Now for the rub, it seems that one must use a monospaced font in order to display rulers so you\'ll also need to change"font_face": "",to"font_face": "Monospace",or any other monospaced font. Thinking about it, this makes sense. If different characters have different widths, then the ruler could potentially not be a single line, but a bunch of annoying line segments. I noticed this while using the default font and my column numbers were not the same for the same vertical position. At the same time, my fancy ruler was specified but not displayed. Changing the font to Monospace solved both problems.If you change font, ruler will not be displayed. E.g. I set "font_face": "Lucida Grande", and ruler disappeared.While the answer by Ross Allen is great, it isn\'t the most convenient if you find yourself wanting to toggle the rulers on and off or change the width at various points while using Sublime.Luckily, someone made a Package that allows you to do this.https://packagecontrol.io/packages/QuickRulersThe package works in both Sublime Text 2 and 3.You can access the command (quick_rulers) through several different means, but by default it is loaded in Omnisearch via "QuickRulers: Open Panel". (i.e., Hit \xe2\x8c\x98 + SHIFT + P and type "QuickRulers: Open Panel")
