I want to run a function when a user edits the content of a div with contenteditable attribute. What\'s the equivalent of an onchange event?I\'m using jQuery so any solutions that uses jQuery is preferred. Thanks!I\'d suggest attaching listeners to key events fired by the editable element, though you need to be aware that keydown and keypress events are fired before the content itself is changed. This won\'t cover every possible means of changing the content: the user can also use cut, copy and paste from the Edit or context browser menus, so you may want to handle the cut copy and paste events too. Also, the user can drop text or other content, so there are more events there (mouseup, for example). You may want to poll the element\'s contents as a fallback.UPDATE 29 October 2014The HTML5 input event is the answer in the long term. At the time of writing, it is supported for contenteditable elements in current Mozilla (from Firefox 14) and WebKit/Blink browsers, but not IE.Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/ch6yn/Here is a more efficient version which uses on for all contenteditables. It\'s based off the top answers here.In CoffeeScript using jQuery:In JavaScript using jQuery:The project is here: https://github.com/balupton/html5editConsider using MutationObserver.  These observers are designed to react to changes in the DOM, and as a performant replacement to Mutation Events.Pros:Cons:Learn more:I have modified lawwantsin \'s answer like so and this works for me. I use the keyup event instead of keypress which works great.non jQuery quick and dirty answer:Here\'s what worked for me:This thread was very helpful while I was investigating the subject. I\'ve modified some of the code available here into a jQuery plugin so it is in a re-usable form, primarily to satisfy my needs but others may appreciate a simpler interface to jumpstart using contenteditable tags. https://gist.github.com/3410122Due to its increasing popularity the plugin has been adopted by Makesites.orgDevelopment will continue from here:https://github.com/makesites/jquery-contenteditableHere is the solution I ended up using and works fabulously. I use $(this).text() instead because I am just using a one line div that is content editable. But you may also use .html() this way you dont have to worry about the scope of a global/non-global variable and the before is actually attached to the editor div.The onchange event doesn\'t fires when an element with the contentEditable attribute is changed, a suggested approach could be to add a button, to "save" the edition.Check this plugin which handles the issue in that way:To avoid timers and "save" buttons, you may use blur event wich fires when the element loses focus. but to be sure that the element was actually changed (not just focused and defocused), its content should be compared against its last version. or use keydown event to set some "dirty" flag on this element.Using DOMCharacterDataModified under MutationEvents will lead to the same. The timeout is setup to prevent sending incorrect values (e.g. in Chrome I had some issues with space key)JSFIDDLE exampleI built a jQuery plugin to do this.You can simply call $(\'.wysiwyg\').wysiwygEvt();You can also remove / add events if you wishA simple answer in JQuery, I just created this code and thought it will be helpful for others tooCheck this idea out.\nhttp://pastie.org/1096892I think it\'s close.  HTML 5 really needs to add the change event to the spec.  The only problem is that the callback function evaluates if (before == $(this).html()) before the content is actually updated in $(this).html().  setTimeout don\'t work, and it\'s sad.  Let me know what you think.Based on @balupton\'s answer:Non JQuery answer...To use it, call on (say) a header element with id="myHeader"That element will now be editable by the user until it loses focus.
