I need to parse the query string www.mysite.com/default.aspx?dest=aboutus.aspx.\nHow do I get the dest variable in JavaScript?Here is a fast and easy way of parsing query strings in JavaScript:Now make a request to page.html?x=Hello:Turns query string like hello=1&another=2 into object {hello: 1, another: 2}. From there, it\'s easy to extract the variable you need. That said, it does not deal with array cases such as "hello=1&hello=2&hello=3". To work with this, you must check whether a property of the object you make exists before adding to it, and turn the value of it into an array, pushing any additional bitsYou can also use the excellent URI.js library by Rodney Rehm. Here\'s how:-And to parse the query string of current page:-Me too! http://jsfiddle.net/drzaus/8EE8k/(Note: without fancy nested or duplicate checking)And tests:Results in:Here\'s my version based loosely on Braceyard\'s version above but parsing into a \'dictionary\' and support for search args without \'=\'. In use it in my JQuery $(document).ready() function. The arguments are stored as key/value pairs in argsParsed, which you might want to save somewhere...Following on from my comment to the answer @bobby posted, here is the code I would use:This code takes in the querystring provided (as \'str\') and returns an object. The string is split on all occurances of &, resulting in an array. the array is then travsersed and each item in it is split by "=". This results in sub arrays wherein the 0th element is the parameter and the 1st element is the value (or undefined if no = sign). These are mapped to object properties, so for example the string "hello=1&another=2&something" is turned into:In addition, this code notices repeating reoccurances such as "hello=1&hello=2" and converts the result into an array, eg:You\'ll also notice it deals with cases in whih the = sign is not used. It also ignores if there is an equal sign straight after an & symbol.A bit overkill for the original question, but a reusable solution if you ever need to work with querystrings in javascript :)The following function will parse the search string with a regular expression, cache the result and return the value of the requested variable:You can either call it once without any parameters and work with the window.parsedSearch object, or call getSearch subsequently.\nI haven\'t fully tested this, the regular expression might still need some tweaking...If you know that you will only have that one querystring variable you can simply do:How about this?..then just call it with:CheersI wanted a simple function that took a URL as an input and returned a map of the query params.\nIf I were to improve this function, I would support the standard for array data in the URL, and or nested variables. This should work back and for with the jQuery.param( qparams ) function.I wanted to pick up specific links within a DOM element on a page, send those users to a redirect page on a timer and then pass them onto the original clicked URL. This is how I did it using regular javascript incorporating one of the methods above.Page with links: HeadBodyRedirect page\nHeadBodyHave a look at this solution. Using his function, you would just not to call gup(\'dest\') to grab the URL dest parameter.
