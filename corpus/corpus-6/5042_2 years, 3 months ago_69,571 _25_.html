I just created a new Swift project within Xcode. I am wondering which version of Swift it\'s using. How can I see, in Xcode or the terminal, what version of Swift I am using inside my project?.What I do is say in the Terminal:Output for Xcode 6.3.2 is:Of course that assumes that your xcrun is pointing at your copy of Xcode correctly. If, like me, you\'re juggling several versions of Xcode, that can be a worry! To make sure that it is, sayand look at the path to Xcode that it shows you. For example:If that\'s your Xcode, then the output from -version is accurate. If you need to repoint xcrun, use the Command Line Tools pop-up menu in Xcode\'s Locations preference pane.Open the Terminal and write:From Xcode 8.3 onward Build Settings has key Swift Language Version with a value of swift version your target is using.For older Xcodes use this solution,\nopen terminal and type following command(s)  Case 1: You have installed only one Xcode App Case 2: You have installed multiple Xcode AppsSwitch active developer directory (Replace Xcode_7.3.app from\nfollowing command with your Xcode app file name from Application directory for which you want\nto check swift version)ThenNOTE: From Xcode 8 to Xcode 8.2.x you can use swift 2.3 even though Xcode 8 uses swift 3.x as default swift version. To use swift 2.3, just turn on flag Use Legacy Swift Language Version to YES from Build Setting and XCode will use Swift 2.3 for that project target. This reddit post helped me:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/4o8atc/xcode_8_which_swift/d4anpetXcode 8 uses Swift 3.0 as default. But you can turn on Swift 2.3. Go to project\'s Build Settings and set \'Use Legacy Swift Language Version\' to YES.Good old reddit :)You can see and select which Swift version Xcode is using in:Target -> Build Settings -> Swift Language Version:This is available in Xcode 8.3 and Xcode 9 (haven\'t checked older versions)Project build setting has a block \'Swift Compiler - Languages\', which stores information about Swift Language Version in key-value format. It will show you all available (supported) Swift Language Version for your Xcode and active version also by tick mark.Look at this snapshot, for easy understanding:
