I was wondering what peoples opinions are of a RESTful \'PUT\' operation that returns nothing(null) in the response body?The HTTP specification (RFC 2616) has a number of recommendations that are applicable. Here is my interpretation:As opposed to most of the answers here, I actually think that PUT should return the updated resource (in addition to the HTTP code of course).The reason why you would want to return the resource as a response for PUT operation is because when you send a resource representation to the server, the server can also apply some processing to this resource, so the client would like to know how does this resource look like after the request completed successfully. (otherwise it will have to issue another GET request).Http response code of 201 for "Created" along with a "Location" header to point to where the client can find the newly created resource.The HTTP/1.1 spec (section 9.6) discusses the appropriate response/error codes. However it doesn\'t address the response content.What would you expect ? A simple HTTP response code (200 etc.) seems straightforward and unambiguous to me.I think it is possible for the server to return content in response to a PUT. If you are using a response envelop format that allows for sideloaded data (such as the format consumed by ember-data), then you can also include other objects that may have been modified via database triggers, etc. (Sideloaded data is explicitly to reduce # of requests, and this seems like a fine place to optimize.)If I just accept the PUT and have nothing to report back, I use status code 204 with no body. If I have something to report, I use status code 200, and include a body.I used RESTful API in my services, and here is my opinion:\nFirst we must get to a common view\xef\xbc\x9a PUT is used to update an resource not create or get.I defined resources with: Stateless resource and Stateful resource:Stateless resources\nFor these resources, just return the HttpCode with empty body, it\'s enough.Stateful resources\nFor example: the resource\'s version. For this kind of resources, you must provide the version when you want to change it, so return the full resource or return the version to the client, so the client need\'t to send a get request after the update action.But, for a service or system, keep it simple, clearly, easy to use and maintain is the most important thing.There\'s a difference between the header and body of a HTTP response. PUT should never return a body, but must return a response code in the header. Just choose 200 if it was successful, and 4xx if not. There is no such thing as a null return code. Why do you want to do this?seems ok... though I\'d think a rudimentary indication of success/failure/time posted/# bytes received/etc. would be preferable.edit: I was thinking along the lines of data integrity and/or record-keeping; metadata such as an MD5 hash or timestamp for time received may be helpful for large datafiles.Ideally it would return a success/fail response.Just as an empty Request body is in keeping with the original purpose of a GET request and empty response body is in keeping with the original purpose of a PUT request.
