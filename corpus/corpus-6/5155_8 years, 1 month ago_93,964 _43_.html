At work I\'ve been tasked with turning a bunch of HTML files into a simple JSP project. It\'s really all static, no serverside logic to program. I should mention I\'m completely new to Java. JSP files seem to make it easy to work with common includes and variables, much like PHP, but I\'d like to know a simple way to get something like template inheritance (Django style) or at least be able to have a base.jsp file containing the header and the footer, so I can insert content later.Ben Lings seems to offer some hope in his answer here:\nJSP template inheritance\nCan someone explain how to achieve this?Given that I don\'t have much time I think dynamic routing is a little much, so I\'m happy to just to have URLs map directly onto .jsp files, but I\'m open to suggestion.Thanks.edit: I don\'t want to use any external libraries, because it would increase the learning curve for myself and others who work on the project, and the company I work for has been contracted to do this.Another edit: I\'m not sure if JSP tags will be useful because my content doesn\'t really have any template variables. What I need is a way to be able to do this:base.html:somepage.htmlwith the output being:I think this would give me enough versatility to do everything I need. It could be achieved with includes but then I would need a top and a bottom include for each wrapper, which is kind of messy.As skaffman suggested, JSP 2.0 Tag Files are the bee\'s knees.Let\'s take your simple example.Put the following in WEB-INF/tags/wrapper.tagNow in your example.jsp page:That does exactly what you think it does.So, lets expand upon that to something a bit more general.\nWEB-INF/tags/genericpage.tagTo use this:What does that buy you? A lot really, but it gets even better...WEB-INF/tags/userpage.tagTo use this:\n(assume we have a user variable in the request)But it turns you like to use that user detail block in other places. So, we\'ll refactor it.\nWEB-INF/tags/userdetail.tagNow the previous example becomes:The beauty of JSP Tag files is that it lets you basically tag generic markup and then refactor it to your heart\'s content.JSP Tag Files have pretty much usurped things like Tiles etc., at least for me. I find them much easier to use as the only structure is what you give it, nothing preconceived. Plus you can use JSP tag files for other things (like the user detail fragment above).Here\'s an example that is similar to DisplayTag that I\'ve done, but this is all done with Tag Files (and the Stripes framework, that\'s the s: tags..). This results in a table of rows, alternating colors, page navigation, etc:Of course the tags work with the JSTL tags (like c:if, etc.). The only thing you can\'t do within the body of a tag file tag is add Java scriptlet code, but this isn\'t as much of a limitation as you might think. If I need scriptlet stuff, I just put the logic in to a tag and drop the tag in. Easy.So, tag files can be pretty much whatever you want them to be. At the most basic level, it\'s simple cut and paste refactoring. Grab a chunk of layout, cut it out, do some simple parameterization, and replace it with a tag invocation.At a higher level, you can do sophisticated things like this table tag I have here.I made quite easy, Django style JSP Template inheritance tag library.\nhttps://github.com/kwon37xi/jsp-template-inheritanceI think it make easy to manage layouts without learning curve.example code :base.jsp : layoutview.jsp : contentsBased on the same basic idea as in @Will Hartung\'s answer, here is my magic one-tag extensible template engine. It even includes documentation and an example :-)WEB-INF/tags/block.tag:Use tiles. It saved my life.But if you can\'t, there\'s the include tag, making it similar to php. The body tag might not actually do what you need it to, unless you have super simple content. The body tag is used to define the body of a specified element. Take a look at this example:You specify the element name, any attributes that element might have ("lang" in this case), and then the text that goes in it--the body. So if Then the output would beYou should be aware that using JSP with lots of <%...%> all over, has generally showed to create applications that are hard to maintain (of a non-trivial size).Hence, you should already now prepare yourself for having to learn an additional layer, either for this or the next project.  Personally I chose JSF for a project which allowed for pure XML jsp-pages invoking taglibs, which was reasonably nice, but had a steep learning curve so I will not recommend it unless you have considered it carefully first :)Regardless of what technology you choose, take one that allows you to separate presentation from actual code.  You will appreciate this some day.
