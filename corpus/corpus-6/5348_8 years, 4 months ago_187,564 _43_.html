How can I change color of a section header in UITableView?EDIT: The answer provided by DJ-S should be considered for iOS 6 and above. The accepted answer is out of date.Hopefully this method from the UITableViewDelegate protocol will get you started:Objective-C:Swift:Updated 2017:Swift 3:Replace [UIColor redColor] with whichever UIColor you would like. You may also wish to adjust the dimensions of headerView.This is an old question, but I think the answer needs to be updated.This method does not involve defining and creating your own custom view.\nIn iOS 6 and up, you can easily change the background color and the text color by defining the section delegate method  For example:Taken from my post here:\nhttps://happyteamlabs.com/blog/ios-how-to-customize-table-view-header-and-footer-colors/Swift 3Here\'s how to change the text color.You can do this if you want header with custom color:This solution works great since iOS 6.0.The following solution works for Swift 1.2 with iOS 8+ Don\'t forget to add this piece of code from the delegate or your view will be cut off or appear behind the table in some cases, relative to the height of your view/label.If you don\'t want to create a custom view, you can also change the color like this (requires iOS 6):Set the background and text color of section area: (Thanks to William Jockusch and Dj S)Setting the background color on UITableViewHeaderFooterView has been deprecated. Please use contentView.backgroundColor instead.Here\'s how to add an image in header view:You can do it on main.storyboard in about 2 seconds.For iOS8 (Beta) and Swift choose the RGB Color you want and try this:}(The "override" is there since i\xc2\xb4m using the UITableViewController instead of a normal UIViewController in my project, but it\xc2\xb4s not mandatory for changing the section header color)The text of your header will still be seen.\nNote that you will need to adjust the section header height.Good Luck.SWIFT 2I was able to successfully change the section background color with an added blur effect (which is really cool). To change the background color of section easily:Then for blur effect, add to code:I know its answered, just in case, In Swift use the followingiOS 8+I have a project using static table view cells, in iOS 7.x.  willDisplayHeaderView does not fire. However, this method works ok:I think this code is not so bad.Based on @Dj S answer, using Swift 3. This works great on iOS 10.In iOS 7.0.4 I created a custom header with it\'s own XIB. Nothing mentioned here before worked. It had to be the subclass of the UITableViewHeaderFooterView to work with the dequeueReusableHeaderFooterViewWithIdentifier: and it seems that class is very stubborn regarding the background color. So finally I added an UIView (you could do it either with code or IB) with name customBackgroudView, and then set it\'s backgroundColor property. In layoutSubviews: I set that view\'s frame to bounds. It work with iOS 7 and gives no glitches.With RubyMotion / RedPotion, paste this into your TableScreen:Works like a charm!Just change the color of layer of the header viewIf anyone needs swift, keeps title:
