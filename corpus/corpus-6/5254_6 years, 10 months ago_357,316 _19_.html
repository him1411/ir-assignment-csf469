Can anybody tell me how to do the following in in a Windows batch script?  (*.bat):In more detail, I want to create a folder named VTS on the C:\\ drive, but only if that folder doesn\'t already exist.  I don\'t want to overwrite the contents of the folder if it already exists and the batch is executed.You just use this: if not exist "C:\\VTS\\" mkdir C:\\VTS it wll create a directory only if the folder does not exist.Note that this existence test will return true only if VTS exists and is a directory.  If it is not there, or is there as a file, the mkdir command will run, and should cause an error.  You might want to check for whether VTS exists as a file as well.See also https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/65994Just call mkdir C:\\VTS no matter what.  It will simply report that the subdirectory already exists.Edit: As others have noted, this does set the %ERRORLEVEL% if the folder already exists. If your batch (or any processes calling it) doesn\'t care about the error level, this method works nicely. Since the question made no mention of avoiding the error level, this answer is perfectly valid. It fulfills the needs of creating the folder if it doesn\'t exist, and it doesn\'t overwrite the contents of an existing folder. Otherwise follow Martin Schapendonk\'s answer.create a folder called VTS and output A subdirectory or file TEST already exists to NUL.or change the drive letter to C:, mkdir, output error to NUL and run the next command.I use this way, you should put a backslash at the end of the directory name to avoid that place exists in a file without extension with the same name as the directory you specified, never use "C:\\VTS" because it can a file exists with the name "VTS" saved in "C:" partition, the correct way is to use "C:\\VTS\\", check out the backslash after the VTS, so is the right way.You can use:You can also expand the code to replace any missing expected files.i created this for my script I use in my work for eyebeam.Try thisROBOCOPY C:\\Users\\ADMIN\\Pictures c:%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2%%date:~10,4% /MOVThis batch will make a new folder and set its name as the current date. (03222013)\nIt then will move any files in the C:\\Users\\ADMIN\\Pictures folder to that newly created folder.If today is March 22 2013....\nAll files in C:\\Users\\ADMIN\\Pictures will be moved to a folder named 03222013.Only files in C:\\Users\\ADMIN\\Pictures will be moved.\nAny folder in C:\\Users\\ADMIN\\Pictures will not be touched.
