I have some issues with Vagrant shared folders, my base system is Ubuntu 13.10 desktop.I do not understand why I have this error is something that is not right configured ? Is a NFS issue or Virtualbox Guest Additions ? I have tried with different many boxes but the same issue.Here is the complete process after vagrant up :My Vagrantfile configuration is :The Personalization file is :The following plugins are enabled in Vagrant:The plugin vagrant-vbguest   solved my problem: Output:Just make sure you are running the latest version of VirtualBoxI found this issue addressed here vagrant issues. Two ways to do it:Run this on guest (i.e. after you ssh into vbox via vagrant ssh )Then run vagrant reload to correctly mount the folders. As @klang pointed out, update the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso file on your mac:Since the iso is no longer available, you can use the 4.3.12 one (http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/virtualbox/4.3.12/VBoxGuestAdditions_4.3.12.iso)note : the binary vbox4.3.12 for os X is not available at this timeI arrived at this page whilst looking for the same error message. \nFor me the cause was different: I had ran a yum update on the system that installed a new kernel. The guest additions where out of date so it couldn\'t load them. I rebuilt them withAnd a vagrant reload later my guest was up and running again.I\'m just adding it here in case someone else gets here the same way I did.Edit (Per KCD\'s comment):\nIt is possible that you get an error saying:The headers for the current running kernel were not foundThis can be resolved by installing kernel-devel (yum install kernel-devel)Fix Step by step:If you not have vbguest plugin, install it:Run VagrantIt is show a error.Login on VMFix!In the guest (VM logged).Back on the host, reload VagrantUpdate February 2016This took me hours to solve independently. Yes, this problem does still exist with latest Vagrant and Virtual Box installs:The symptoms for me were messages something like: Checking for guest additions in VM... The guest additions on this VM do not match the installed version of VirtualBox!followed by a failure to mount NFS drives.1). Install the vagrant-vbguest plugin.Depending on version of Vagrant you are using, issue one of the following commands:Next, do vagrant halt, followed by vagrant up - chances are you still have issues.2). ssh into your guest and setup a soft link to the correct version of Guest Additions (here, 5.0.14).You should be all good. By default, the mounted drive on guest is at /vagrantFinal comment:IF you still have problems related to mounting NFS drives, then here is a workaround that worked for me. I had a vagrantfile with config something like:Simply remove the mount type information, and slim down the mount_options settings so they work universally. Vagrant will now automatically choose the best synced folder option for your environment.Install the vagrant-vbguest plugin by running this command:I experienced the same issue with Centos 7, I assume due to an outdated kernel in combination with an updated version of VirtualBox. Based on Blizz\'s update, this is what worked for me (vagrant-vbguest plugin already installed):As mentioned in Vagrant issue #3341 this was a Virtualbox bug #12879.It affects only VirtualBox 4.3.10 and was completely fixed in 4.3.12.For me, with VBoxGuestAdditions 5.1.20, the problem was that /sbin/mount.vboxsf pointed to the wrong location.sudo ln -sf /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-5.1.20/lib/VBoxGuestAdditions/mount.vboxsf /sbin/mount.vboxsffixed it for meI believe this is the most updated answer now and it worked for me ( Guest Additions Version: 5.0.6, VirtualBox Version: 4.3.16, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/3341#issuecomment-144271026Basically i says:Just for future reference, this problem happened with me, using Vagrant 1.7.4 and VirtualBox 5.0.10 r104061, when I provisioned a shared folder in / and created a symbolic link to my home folder. Something like this:Apparently, this operation is not allowed by Vagrant due to security purposes and throws the described error.I solved it by provisioning the desired folder directly to my home directory, such as /home/vagrant/folder.(from my comment above)Following the problem to it\'s roots: , specifically the part in the comments saying this:After doing that, I have business as usual with all my virtual machines (and their current Vagrantfiles, of course)When you have to do something in a freshly created virtual machine, to make it work, something is wrong.In configuration where windows is a host, and linux is a guest I found solution of the same problem in other place.So again, the error message was "Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually because the "vboxsf" file system is not available." (...)This was caused because I have made mistake by doing symlink inside the guest system from /vagrant into /home/vagrant/vagrant. The point is, that the directory /vagrant is a normal linux directory that has a symlink (so all ok), but when booting up by "vagrant up", it tries to mount windows directory on that place, and windows directory cannot work as a symlink. Windows host does not support linux symlinks.So what You can do then, is to ssh into guest, remove the symlink wherever You have it, and reload machine.In my configuration it was: Vagrant 1.7.2, VBoxGuestAdditions 4.3.28 and VBox 4.3.28.This is 2017. Just in case someone faces the same issue. For bento/centos-6.7, I was getting same error. That was solved by adding plugin vagrant-vbguest (0.13.0).\nc:> vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguestBox url: http://opscode-vm-bento.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/virtualbox/opscode_centos-7.0_chef-provisionerless.boxThis centos-7 version was giving me same error Error:My Configuration:Since I already have vagrant-vbguest plugin, it tries to update the VBoxGuestAdditions in centos-7 when it sees different version of VBGuestAdditions are installed in Host 5.0.10 and guest 4.3.20. I even have checked that symbolic link exists.This did not work as suggested by user3006381Solution for centos-7: as given by psychok7 workedDiabled autoupdate.  config.vbguest.auto_update = false\nThen vagrant destroy --force and vagrant upResult:In my case on a previously working Ubuntu 16.04 image, the error started after installing vagrant-vbguest for a different vagrant image, and then starting the Ubuntu VM.  It upgraded the guest additions to 5.1.20, and since then the mounts started failing.  Updated the box, apt update + upgrade and the same, vbguest would install the newer 5.1.20 version.It was solved by manually running:And also disabling the: config.vbguest.auto_update = false\nfor this VM (might not be necessary).Your log complains about not finding exportfs:\n     sudo: /usr/bin/exportfs: command not foundThe exportfs makes local directories available for NFS clients to mount.This seems to be due to an incompatibility with the vbguest vagrant plugin and the latest version(s) of vagrant. It is trying to update the guest additions and failing to do it completely/properly.Try like it:In Vagrantfile add:Run:One more step I had to complete after following the first suggestion that kenzie made was to run the mount commands listed in the error message with sudo from the Ubuntu command line [14.04 Server]. After that, everything was good to go!
