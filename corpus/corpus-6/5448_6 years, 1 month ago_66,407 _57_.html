How do I print a list of my git aliases, i.e., something analogous to the bash alias command?I created a git alias called (strangely enough) alias for exactly this purpose... handy from time to time if you use aliasing enough...$ git config --global alias.alias "config --get-regexp ^alias\\."Note, the regex makes sure the line starts with alias..Another alternative (purely something I find easy to remember):git config --list | grep aliasThis answer builds upon the answer by johnny. It applies if you\'re not using git-alias from git-extras.On Linux, run once:This will create a permanent git alias named alias which gets stored in your ~/.gitconfig file. Using it will list all of your git aliases, in nearly the same format as they are in the ~/.gitconfig file. To use it, type:The following optional considerations apply:To prevent the alias alias from getting listed as above, append | grep -v ^\'alias \' just before the closing double-quote. I don\'t recommend this for Linux users so that they don\'t forget that the the command alias is but an alias and is not a feature of git.To sort the listed aliases, append | sort just before the closing double-quote. Alternatively, you can keep the aliases in ~/.gitconfig sorted.To add the alias as a system-wide alias, replace --global (for current user) with --system (for all users). This typically goes in the /etc/gitconfig file.Did I hear \'bash scripting\'? ;)About the \'not needed\' part in a comment above, I basically created a man page like overview for my aliases. Why all the fuss? Isn\'t that complete overkill?Read on...I have set the commands like this in my .gitconfig, separated like TAB=TAB:and simply defined another alias to grep the TAB= part of the defined aliases. (All other options don\'t have tabs before and after the \'=\' in their definition, just spaces.)Comments not appended to an alias also have a TAB===== appended, so they are shown after grepping.For better viewing I am piping the grep output into less, like this:The \'\\t=\' part matches TAB=.To have an even better overview of what aliases I have, and since I use the bash console, I colored the output with terminal colors:Basically the same as above, just sed usage is added to get the color codes into the output.The -R flag of less is needed to get the colors shown in less.(I recently found out, that long commands with a scrollbar under their window are not shown correctly on mobile devices: They text is cut off and the scrollbar is simply missing. That might be the case with the last code snippet here, keep that in mind when looking at code snippets here while on the go.)I have a like half a mile of aliases, tailored to my needs.\nAlso some of them change over time, so after all the best idea to have an up-to-date list at hand is parsing the .gitconfig.A ****short**** excerpt from my .gitconfig aliases:In my linux or mac workstations also further aliases exist in the .bashrc\'s, sort of like:That way no need to type git help submodule, no need for git h submodule, just gh submodule is all that is needed to get the help. It is just some characters, but how often do you type them?I use all of the following, of course only with shortcuts... This was just from the top of my head.I often have to use git without a gui, since a lot of the git commands are not implemented properly in any of the graphical frontends. But everytime I put them to use, it is mostly in the same manner.On the \'not implemented\' part mentioned in the last paragraph:\nI have yet to find something that compares to this in a GUI:\nsba    =    show-branch --color=always -a --more=10 --no-name - show all local and remote branches as well as the commits they have within them\nccm    =    "!git reset --soft HEAD~ && git commit" - change last commit messageFrom a point of view that is more simple:\nHow often do you type git add . or git commit -am "..."? Not counting even the rest...\nGetting things to work like git aa or git ca "..." in windows,\nor with bash aliases gaa/g aa or gca "..."/g ca "..." in linux and on mac\'s...For my needs it seemed a smart thing to do, to tailor git commands like this... \n... and for easier use I just helped myself for lesser used commands, so i dont have to consult the man pages everytime. Commands are predefined and looking them up is as easy as possible.I mean, we are programmers after all? Getting things to work like we need them is our job.Here is an additional screenshot, this works in Windows:colorized man pagesAs other answers mentioned, git config -l lists all your configuration details from your config file. Here\'s a partial example of that output for my configuration:So we can grep out the alias lines, using git config -l | grep alias:We can make this prettier by just cutting out the alias. part of each line, leaving us with this command:Which prints:Lastly, don\'t forget to add this as an alias:Enjoy!Using git var and filtering only those that start with alias:for windows:Add to your .gitconfig under [alias]:Then you can do If you know the name of the alias, you can use the --help option to describe it. For example:There is a built-in function... trylists all the aliases :)Yet another git alias (called alias) that prints out git aliases: add the following to your gitconfig [alias] section:Example usage, giving full alias name (matches alias name exactly: i.e., ^foobar$), and simply shows the value:Or, give regexp, which shows all matching aliases & values: Caveats: quote the regexp to prevent shell expansion as a glob, although it\'s not technically necessary if/when no files match the pattern. Also: any regexp is fine, except ^ (pattern start) and $ (pattern end) can\'t be used; they are implied. Assumes you\'re not using git-alias from git-extras.Also, obviously your aliases will be different; these are just a few that I have configured. (Perhaps you\'ll find them useful, too.)
