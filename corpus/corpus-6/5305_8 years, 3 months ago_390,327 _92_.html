What is the fundamental difference between the Set<E> and List<E> interfaces?List is an ordered sequence of elements whereas Set is a distinct list of elements which is unordered (thank you, Quinn Taylor).List<E>:An ordered collection (also known as a\n  sequence). The user of this interface\n  has precise control over where in the\n  list each element is inserted. The\n  user can access elements by their\n  integer index (position in the list),\n  and search for elements in the list.Set<E>:A collection that contains no\n  duplicate elements. More formally,\n  sets contain no pair of elements e1\n  and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at\n  most one null element. As implied by\n  its name, this interface models the\n  mathematical set abstraction.Ordered lists of element (unique or not)\nConform to Java\'s interface named List\nCan be accessed by indeximplemetented usingLists of unique elements:\nConform to Java\'s interface named Set\nCan not be accessed by indeximplemetented usingBoth interfaces Set and List conform to Java\'s interface named CollectionA Set cannot contain duplicate elements while a List can.  A List (in Java) also implies order.Conceptually we usually refer to an unordered grouping that allows duplicates as a Bag and doesn\'t allow duplicates is a Set.ListSetLists generally allow duplicate objects.\nLists must be ordered, and are therefore accessible by index.Implementation classes include: ArrayList, LinkedList, VectorSets  do not allow duplicate objects.\nMost implementations are unordered, but it is implementation specific.Implementation classes include:\n HashSet (unordered), \n LinkedHashSet (ordered),\n TreeSet (ordered by natural order or by provided comparator)As we are talking about the Java interfaces, why not look at the Javadoc ?!There is NO mention about lack of order concerning Sets: it depends on the implementation.This might not be the answer you\'re looking for, but the JavaDoc of the collections classes is actually pretty descriptive. Copy/pasted:An ordered collection (also known as a\n  sequence). The user of this interface\n  has precise control over where in the\n  list each element is inserted. The\n  user can access elements by their\n  integer index (position in the list),\n  and search for elements in the list.Unlike sets, lists typically allow\n  duplicate elements. More formally,\n  lists typically allow pairs of\n  elements e1 and e2 such that\n  e1.equals(e2), and they typically\n  allow multiple null elements if they\n  allow null elements at all. It is not\n  inconceivable that someone might wish\n  to implement a list that prohibits\n  duplicates, by throwing runtime\n  exceptions when the user attempts to\n  insert them, but we expect this usage\n  to be rare.A set is an unordered group of distinct objects \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0no duplicate objects are allowed. It is generally implemented using the hash code of the objects being inserted. (Specific implementations may add ordering, but the Set interface itself does not.)A list is an ordered group of objects which may contain duplicates. It could be implemented with an ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.1.List allows duplicate values and  set does\'nt allow duplicates2.List maintains the order in which you inserted elements in to the list\nSet does\'nt maintain order.\n3.List is an ordered sequence of elements whereas Set is a distinct list of elements which is unordered.Ordering... a list has an order, a set does not.All of the List classes maintain the order of insertion.  They use different implementations based on performance and other characteristics (e.g. ArrayList for speed of access of a specific index, LinkedList for simply maintaining order). Since there is no key, duplicates are allowed.The Set classes do not maintain insertion order. They may optionally impose a specific order (as with SortedSet), but typically have an implementation-defined order based on some hash function (as with HashSet). Since Sets are accessed by key, duplicates are not allowed.List Vs Set1) Set does not allow duplicates. List allows duplicate. Based on the implementation of Set, It also maintains the insertion Order .eg : LinkedHashSet. It maintains the insertion order.Please refer click here2) contains method. By nature of the Set it will give better performance to access. Best case its o(1). But List has performance issue to invoke contains.Few note worthy differences between List and Set in Java are given as following :1) Fundamental difference between List and Set in Java is allowing duplicate elements. List in Java allows duplicates while Set doesn\'t allow any duplicate. If you insert duplicate in Set it will replace the older value. Any implementation of Set in Java will only contains unique elements.2) Another significant difference between List and Set in Java is order. List is an Ordered Collection while Set is an unordered Collection. List maintains insertion order of elements, means any element which is inserted before will go on lower index than any element which is inserted after. Set in Java doesn\'t  maintain any order. Though Set provide another alternative called SortedSet which can store Set elements in specific Sorting order defined by Comparable and Comparator methods of Objects stored in Set.3) Popular implementation of List interface in Java includes ArrayList, Vector and LinkedList. While popular implementation of Set interface includes HashSet, TreeSet and LinkedHashSet.Its pretty clear that if you need to maintain insertion order or object and you collection can contain duplicates than List is a way to go. On the other hand if your requirement is to maintain unique collection without any duplicates than Set is the way to go.Set<E> and List<E> are both used to store elements of type E.  The difference is that Set is stored in unordered way and does not allow duplicate values. List is used to store elements in ordered way and it does allow duplicate values.Set elements cannot be accessed by an index position, and List elements can be accessed with an index position.List:Set:DuplicitySet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \n        allow duplicates. Set and all of the classes which\n        implements Set interface should have unique elements.\n List allows\n        duplicate elements. Any number of duplicate elements can be inserted\n        into the list without affecting the same existing values and their\n        indexes.Null valuesOrder List and all of its implementation classes maintains the insertion order.\nSet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t maintain any order still few of its classes sort the elements in an order such as LinkedHashSet maintains the elements in insertion order and TreeSet(the elements maintain the ascending order by default)class implementationsList:\nList is allow duplicate elements and null values.Easy for search elements using the corresponding index of the element and also it will display elements in insertion order.\nExample:(linkedlist)\nimport java.util.*;public class ListExample {}Output:1\n1\n555\n333\n888\n555\nnull\nnull\nValue:1\nValue:555\nValue:333\nValue:888\nValue:555\nValue:null\nValue:nullSet:\nSet isn\'t allow any duplicate elements and it allow single null value.It will not maintain any order to display elements.Only TreeSet will display in ascending order.Example:(TreeSet)import java.util.TreeSet;public class SetExample {}Output:all\nhello\nwelcome\nworld\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nSet doesn\'t allow null value and duplicate valueDifference based on following points1) Duplicity: List allows duplicate elements. Any number of duplicate elements can be inserted into the list without affecting the same existing values and their indexes.\nSet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow duplicates. Set and all of the classes which implements Set interface should have unique elements.2) Null values: List allows any number of null values.\nSet allows single null value at most.3) Order: List and all of its implementation classes maintains the insertion order.\nSet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t maintain any order; still few of its classes sort the elements in an order such as LinkedHashSet maintains the elements in insertion order.Hi So many answers are already given..Let me point out some points which are not mentioned so far:Here ist a clear example with groovy. i create a set and a list.\nthen i try to store 20 randomly generated value within each list. the generated value can be in range 0 to 5The result :random Numbers: 4, 1, 4, 0, 1, 2, 4, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3Set : [4, 1, 0, 2, 3] list : [4, 1, 4, 0, 1, 2, 4, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3] You can see that the difference is that:Like the answer as SET don\'t have duplicate value and List can.\nOf course, order is another one thing to different them apart.Set:\nA Set cannot have Duplicate elements in its collections. it is also an unordered collection. To access the data from Set, it is required to use Iterator only and index based retrieve is not possible for it. It is mainly used whenever required uniqueness collection.List:\nA List can have duplicate elements, with the natural ordered as it is inserted.\nThus, it can be retrieved data based on index or iterator. It is widely used to store collection which needs to access based on index.TOPIC Name: List VS SetI have just gone through Java\'s most important topic called Collections Framework. I thought to share my little knowledge about Collections with you. List, Set, Map are the most important topic of it. So let\'s start with List and Set.Difference between List and Set:List is a collection class which extends AbstractList class where as Set is a collection class which extends AbstractSet class but both implements Collection interface.List interface allows duplicate values (elements) whereas Set interface does not allow duplicate values. In case of duplicate elements in Set, it replaces older values.List interface allows NULL values where as Set interface does not allow Null values. In case of using Null values in Set it gives NullPointerException. List interface maintains insertion order. That means the way we add the elements in the List in the same way we obtain it using iterator or for-each style. Whereas Set implementations do not necessarily maintain insertion order. (Although SortedSet does using TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet maintains insertion order).List interface has its own methods defined whereas Set interface does not have its own method so Set uses Collection interface methods only.List interface has one legacy class called Vector whereas Set interface does not have any legacy classLast but not the least... The listIterator() method can only be used to cycle through the elements within List Classes whereas we can use iterator() method to access Set class elementsAnything else can we add? Please let me know.Thanks.Set:Cannot have duplicate values\nOrdering depends on implementation. By default it is not ordered\nCannot have access by indexList:Can have duplicate values\nOrdered by default\nCan have access by index
