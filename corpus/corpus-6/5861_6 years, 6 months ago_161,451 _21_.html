How do I set up IntelliJ IDEA for Android applications?I\'ve spent a day on trying to put all the pieces together, been in hundreds of sites and tutorials, but they all skip trivial steps.So here\'s the full guide:New Project: Compiling:The 5th step in "New Project\' has apparently changed slightly since.Where it says android sdk then has the drop down menu that says none, there is no longer a \'new\' button.5.)Once I have followed all these steps, I start to receive error messages in all android classes calls like:I revolved that including android.jar in the SDKs Platform Settings:Just in case someone is lost. For both new application or existing ones go to File->Project Structure. Then in Project settings on the left pane select Project for the Java SDK and select Modules for Android SDK.I had some issues that this didn\'t address in getting this environment set up on OSX. It had to do with the solution that I was maintaining having additional dependencies on some of the Google APIs. It wasn\'t enough to just download and install the items listed in the first response.You have to download these. Another way to identify the correct SDK is to install Android Studio, create a new project, go to project structure, SDK Location and find where the SDK was installed.I found using the default installation process on a mac that the SDK home folder was in the /Users/\'yourUser\'/Library/Android/sdk folder.  Make sure you have enabled your Mac to view the Library folder.You just need to install Android development kit from http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html#Updatingand also Download and install Java JDK (Choose the Java platform)define the environment variable in windows System setting https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Setting+the+JAVA_HOME+Variable+in+WindowsVoila ! You are Donezo !
