I have a web application on a Linux server which starts with <?I needed to copy this application to a windows environment and everything is working fine except that an SQL statement is being rendered differently. I don\'t know if this has to do with the script beginning with <?php instead of <? because I don\'t know from where to enable the <? from the PHP.ini so I changed it to <?phpI know that these 2 statements are supposed to mean the same but I need to test it with <? in order to ensure that the application is exactly the same. This way I can eliminate another possibility.ThanksSetin php.iniAnd restart your Apache server.This can be done by enabling short_open_tag in php.ini:If you don\'t have access to the php.ini you can try to enable them trough the .htaccess file but it\'s possible the hosting company disabled this if you are on shared hosting:For the people thinking that short_open_tags are bad practice as of php 5.4 the <?= ... ?> shorttag will supported everywhere, regardless of the settings so there is no reason not to use them if you can control the settings on the server. Also said in this link: short_open_tagThis can be done by enabling short_open_tag in php.ini:1.To locate php.ini file,on comment line executeyou will get some thing like this,See 2nd line from the comment output.The file will be in the mentioned path.2.Open php.ini file and find short_open_tag. By default it is in off change it to on.3.Restart the server,execute this comment ThanksTo set short tags to open from a Vagrant install script on Ubuntu:I can see all answers above are partially correct only.\nIn reality all 21st Century PHP apps will have FastCGI Process Manager(php-fpm) so once you have added php-info() into your test.php script and checked the correct path for php.iniIMPORTANT: then you must restart your php-fpm process so this can work!and then finally restart your nginx/http serveryou need to turn on short_open_tags.As simple, as that, follow the following steps:so, \nshort_open_tag = OnIn CentOS 6(tested on Centos 7 too) you can\'t set short_open_tag in /etc/php.ini for php-fpm.\nYou will have error:You must edit config for your site, which can found in /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf\nAnd write at end of file:if you edit your php.ini file, remember to restart your service (apache2, etc) for the edits to php.ini to take effectIf you are using Ubuntu with Apache+php5, then on current versions there are 2 places where you need to change to short_open_tag = OnFor Wamp Server users there is easier way:\nYou may enable that setting simply (left) click once on the WampServer icon, choose PHP -> PHP settings -> short open tag. Wait for a second, then WampServer will automatically restart your PHP and also its web service.originally from: http://osticket.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3149if using xampp, you will notice the php.ini file has twice mentioned short_open_tag . Enable the second one to short_open_tag = On . The first one is commented out and you might be tempted to uncomment and edit it but it is over-ridden by a second short_open_tagIf you are using xampp in windows then please do followingFind short_open_tag using ctrl+f utilityYou will found ;short_open_tagkindly remove the semicolon (;) from line.and keep it as short_open_tag = onFinally, restart your Apache serverTo enable short_open_tag for a particular domain with php-fpm, you must edit :/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/xxxxxxxxxx.confWhere xxxxx is the socket number of the domain.And add : php_value[short_open_tag] =  OnSet the asp_tags = On and short_open_tag = On in both the files \\apache\\Apache2.2.21\\bin\\php.ini and \\bin\\php\\php5.3.8\\php.ini  and then restart the apache server.
