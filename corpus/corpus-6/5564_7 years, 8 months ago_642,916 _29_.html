I want to create a link on a webpage that would close current active tab in a browser without closing other tabs in the browser. When user clicks close link, an alert message should appear asking user to confirm with two buttons, "YES" and "NO". If user clicks "YES", close that page and If "NO", do nothing.How can it be done? Any suggestions?You will need Javascript to do this. Use window.close():Note: the current tab is implied. This is equivalent:or you can specify a different window.So:with HTML:or:You return false here to prevent the default behavior for the event. Otherwise the browser will attempt to go to that URL (which it obviously isn\'t).Now the options on the window.confirm() dialog box will be OK and Cancel (not Yes and No). If you really want Yes and No you\'ll need to create some kind of modal Javascript dialog box.Note: there is browser-specific differences with the above. If you opened the window with Javascript (via window.open()) then you are allowed to close the window with javascript. Firefox disallows you from closing other windows. I believe IE will ask the user for confirmation. Other browsers may vary.Try thisThis method works in Chrome and IE:As far as I can tell, it no longer is possible in Chrome or FireFox.  It may still be possible in IE (at least pre-Edge).It is possible. I searched the whole net for this, but once when i took one of microsoft\'s survey, I finally got the answer.try this:this will close the current tab for you.Try this as well. Working for me on all three major browsers. The following works for me in Chrome 41:I\'ve tried several ideas for FF including opening an actual web-page, but nothing seems to work. As far as I understand, any browser will close a tab or window with xxx.close() if it was really opened by JS, but FF,  at least, cannot be duped into closing a tab by opening new content inside that tab.That makes sense when you think about it - a user may well not want JS closing a tab or window that has useful history.Tested successfully in FF 18 and Chrome 24:Insert in head:HTML:Credits go to Marcos J. Drake.This is one way of solving the same, declare a JavaScript function like thisAdd the following line to the HTML to call the function using a <button>Here\'s how you would create such a link: <a href="javascript:if(confirm(\'Close window?\'))window.close()">close</a>
