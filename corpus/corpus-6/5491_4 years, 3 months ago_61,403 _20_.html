The way you git ignore watching/tracking a particular dir/file. you just run this:  git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>Now how do you undo it so they are watched again? (lets call it un-assume)To get undo/show dir\'s/files that are set to assume-unchanged run this:git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>To get a list of dir\'s/files that are assume-unchanged run this:git ls-files -v|grep \'^h\'If this is a command that you use often - you may want to consider having an alias for it as well. Add to your global .gitconfig:After saving this to your .gitconfig, you can run a cleaner command.orThis resource was very helpfulgit update-index function has several option you can find typing as below:Here you will find various option - how to handle with the function update-index.
