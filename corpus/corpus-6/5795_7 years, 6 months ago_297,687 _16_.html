I have 3 classes in my example:\nClass A, the main activity.  Class A calls a startActivityForResult:Class B, this class is a TabActivity:Class C, this class is a regular Activity:onActivityResult is called in Class A, but the resultCode is RESULT_CANCELED instead of RESULT_OK and the returned intent is null.  How do I return something from the Activity inside a TabHost?I realize that the problem is that my Class C is actually running inside of Class B, and Class B is what is returning the RESULT_CANCELED back to Class A.  I just don\'t know a work around yet.Oh, god! After spending several hours and downloading the Android sources, I have finally come to a solution.If you look at the Activity class, you will see, that finish() method only sends back the result if there is a mParent property set to null. Otherwise the result is lost.So my solution is to set result to the parent activity if present, like that:I hope that will be helpful if someone looks for this problem workaround again.http://tylenoly.wordpress.com/2010/10/27/how-to-finish-activity-with-results/With a slight modification for "param_result"Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_FORWARD_RESULT?If set and this intent is being used to launch a new activity from an\n  existing one, then the reply target of the existing activity will be\n  transfered to the new activity.You could implement a onActivityResult in Class B as well and launch Class C using startActivityForResult. Once you get the result in Class B then set the result there (for Class A) based on the result from Class C. I haven\'t tried this out but I think this should work.Another thing to look out for is that Activity A should not be a singleInstance activity. For startActivityForResult to work your Class B needs to be a sub activity to Activity A and that is not possible in a single instance activity, the new Activity (Class B) starts in a new task.For start Activit 2 from  Activity 1 and get result, you colud use startActivityForResul and implement onActivityResult in Activity 1 and use setResult in Activity2.
