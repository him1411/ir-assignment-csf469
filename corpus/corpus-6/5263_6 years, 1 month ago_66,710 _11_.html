Ok so I can use an OrderedDict in json.dump. That is, an OrderedDict can be used as an input to JSON.But can it be used as an output? If so how? In my case I\'d like to load into an OrderedDict so I can keep the order of the keys in the file.If not, is there some kind of workaround?Yes, you can.  By specifying the object_pairs_hook argument to JSONDecoder.  In fact, this is the exact example given in the documentation.You can pass this parameter to json.loads (if you don\'t need a Decoder instance for other purposes) like so:Using json.load is done in the same way:Simple version for Python 2.7+Or for Python 2.4 to 2.6You could always write out the list of keys in addition to dumping the dict, and then reconstruct the OrderedDict by iterating through the list?In addition to dumping the ordered list of keys alongside the dictionary, another low-tech solution, which has the advantage of being explicit, is to dump the (ordered) list of key-value pairs ordered_dict.items(); loading is a simple OrderedDict(<list of key-value pairs>).It is indeed nice to take advantage of the fact that json dumps the OrderedDict in the correct order. However, it is in general not so nice to have to read each JSON dictionary as an OrderedDict (through the object_pairs_hook argument), so an explicit conversion of only the dictionaries that must be ordered makes sense too.
