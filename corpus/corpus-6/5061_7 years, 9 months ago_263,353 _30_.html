I am using a linear layout to display a pretty light initial screen.  It has 1 button that is supposed to centre in the screen both horizontally and vertically.  However no matter what I try to do the button will top align centre.  I have included the XML below, can some one point me in the right direction?ThanksIf you want to center an item in the middle of the screen don\'t use a LinearLayout as these are meant for displaying a number of items in a row.Use a RelativeLayout instead.  So replace:for the relevant RelativeLayout option:So your layout file will look like this:Center using a LinearLayout:Have you tried defining android:gravity="center_vertical|center_horizontal" inside the layout and setting android:layout_weight="1" in the image?A commonly-used method that works with linear layout is to set a property on the image buttonYou can choose whether to left-align, center-align, or right-align each object in the linear layout.  Note that the above line is precisely the same aseasy with thisYou can use the RelativeLayout.The above code will work.Add thisIn LinearLayout.complete and working sample from my machine...As per the Android documentation for XML Attributes of android:layout_gravity, we can do it easily :)You also can Try this Code:just use  ( to make it in the center of your layout)and use to change postionSet to true  android:layout_alignParentTop="true" and  android:layout_centerHorizontal="true" in the Button, like this:Did you try this?use android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"It would be easier to use relative layouts, but for linear layouts I usually center by making sure the width matches parent : and then just give margins to right and left accordingly.
