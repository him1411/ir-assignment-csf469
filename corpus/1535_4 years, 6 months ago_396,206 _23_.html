In my controller, I have data like:\n$scope.object = dataNow this data is the dictionary with keys and values from json.I can access the attribute with object.name in the template. Is there any way that I can iterate over the keys as well and display them in table like<tr><td> {{key}} </td> <td> data.key </td>The data is like thisHow about:This method is listed in the docs: http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngRepeatIf you would like to edit the property value with two way binding:I don\'t think there\'s a builtin function in angular for doing this, but you can do this by creating a separate scope property containing all the header names, and you can fill this property automatically like this:A todo list example which loops over object by ng-repeat:we can follow below procedure to avoid display of key-values in alphabetical order.JavascriptHTMLComplete example here:-You can do it in your javascript (controller) or in your html (angular view)...js:html:I believe the html way is more angular , but you can also do in your controller and retrieve it in your html...also not a bad idea to look at the Object keys, they give you the an array of the keys if you need them, more info here:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keysHere\'s a working example:edited
