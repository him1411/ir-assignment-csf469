Is this the right way to create a directory if it doesn\'t exist.\nIt should have full permission for the script and readable by others.No, for multiple reasons.The path module does not have an exists/existsSync method.  It is in the fs module.  (Perhaps you just made a typo in your question?)The docs explicitly discourage you from using exists.fs.exists() is an anachronism and exists only for historical reasons. There should almost never be a reason to use it in your own code.In particular, checking if a file exists before opening it is an anti-pattern that leaves you vulnerable to race conditions: another process may remove the file between the calls to fs.exists() and fs.open(). Just open the file and handle the error when it\'s not there.Since we\'re talking about a directory rather than a file, this advice implies you should just unconditionally call mkdir and ignore EEXIST.In general, You should avoid the *Sync methods.  They\'re blocking, which means absolutely nothing else in your program can happen while you go to the disk.  This is a very expensive operation, and the time it takes breaks the core assumption of node\'s event loop.The *Sync methods are usually fine in single-purpose quick scripts (those that do one thing and then exit), but should almost never be used when you\'re writing a server: your server will be unable to respond to anyone for the entire duration of the I/O requests.  If multiple client requests require I/O operations, your server will very quickly grind to a halt.The only time I\'d consider using *Sync methods in a server application is in an operation that happens once (and only once), at startup.  For example, require actually uses readFileSync to load modules.Even then, you still have to be careful because lots of synchronous I/O can unnecessarily slow down your server\'s startup time.Instead, you should use the asynchronous I/O methods.So if we put together those pieces of advice, we get something like this:And we can use it like this:Of course, this doesn\'t account for edge cases likeI have found and npm module that works like a charm for this.\nIt\'s simply do a recursively mkdir when needed, like a "mkdir -p ".https://www.npmjs.com/package/mkdirpThe best solution would be to use the npm module called node-fs-extra. It has a method called mkdir which creates the directory you mentioned. If you give a long directory path, it will create the parent folders automatically. The module is a super set of npm module fs, so you can use all the functions in fs also if you add this module. I\'d like to add a Typescript Promise refactor of josh3736\'s answer.It does the same thing and has the same edge cases, it just happens to use Promises, typescript typedefs and works with "use strict".This may help you :)Here is a little function to recursivlely create directories:
