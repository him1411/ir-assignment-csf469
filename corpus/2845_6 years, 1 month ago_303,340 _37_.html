I am trying to support CORS in my Node.js application that uses the Express.js web framework. I have read a Google group discussion about how to handle this, and read a few articles about how CORS works. First, I did this (code is written in CoffeeScript syntax):It doesn\'t seem to work. It seems like my browser (Chrome) is not sending the initial OPTIONS request. When I just updated the block for the resource I need to submit a cross-origin GET request to:It works (in Chrome). This also works in Safari.I have read that...In a browser implementing CORS, each cross-origin GET or POST request is preceded by an OPTIONS request that checks whether the GET or POST is OK.So my main question is, how come this doesn\'t seem to happen in my case? Why isn\'t my app.options block called? Why do I need to set the headers in my main app.get block?To answer your main question, the CORS spec only requires the OPTIONS call to precede the POST or GET if the POST or GET has any non-simple content or headers in it.See "Preflighted requests" in https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_access_controlI found the easiest way is to use the node.js package cors. The simplest usage is:There are, of course many ways to configure the behaviour to your needs; the page linked above shows a number of examples.Try passing control to the next matching route.  If Express is matching app.get route first, then it won\'t continue onto the options route unless you do this (note use of next):In terms of organising the CORS stuff, I put it in a middleware which is working well for me:To stay in the same idea of routing. I  use this code :Similar to http://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html exampleI have made a more complete middleware suitable for express or connect. It supports OPTIONS requests for preflight checking. Note that it will allow CORS access to anything, you might want to put in some checks if you want to limit access.doand just add  these lines in your main file where your request is going.install cors module of expressjs. you can follow these steps > Installation Simple Usage (Enable All CORS Requests)for more details go to https://github.com/expressjs/corsDo something like this:Testing done with express + node + ionic running in differente ports.Localhost:8100Localhost:5000This works for me, as its an easy implementation inside the routes, im using meanjs and its working fine, safari, chrome, etc.My simplest solution with Express 4.2.0 (EDIT: Doesn\'t seem to work in 4.3.0) was:I suppose doing app.all(\'/result\', ...) would work too...I found it to be extremely easy to do this with the npm request package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) Then I based my solution on this post http://blog.javascripting.com/2015/01/17/dont-hassle-with-cors/In addition to what others have said, don\'t forget that unless using nodemon you will need to restart your node server for the changes to take effect!I personally had been refreshing my browser out of habit, forgetting that it\'s server side code.We can avoid CORS and forward the requests to the other server instead:Some time ago, I faced this problem so i did this to allow CORS in my nodejs app:first simply install cors in your project.\nTake terminal(command prompt) and cd to your project directory and run the below command:Then take the server.js file and change the code to add the following in it:This worked for me..
