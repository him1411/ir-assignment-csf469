git blame is great for modified and added lines but how can I find when a line that existed in a specific previous commit was eventually deleted.  I\'m thinking bisect but I was hoping for something handier.[ before you ask: in the case, I just did a git log -p and searched through for the code line and (a) some idiot had just deleted the vital line in the previous commit and (b) I was that idiot ]If you know the contents of the line, this is an ideal use case for:which shows you commits which introduce or remove an instance of that string. There\'s also the -G<regex> which does the same thing with regular expressions! See man git-log and search for the -G and -S options, or pickaxe (the friendly name for these features) for more information.The -S option is actually mentioned in the header of the git-blame manpage too, in the description section, where it gives an example using git log -S....I think what you really want isFrom the manpage:Walk history forward instead of backward. Instead of showing the revision in which a line appeared, this shows the last revision in which a line has existed. This requires a range of revision like START..END where the path to blame exists in START. git blame --reverse can get you close to where the line is deleted. But it actually doesn\'t point to the revision where the line is deleted. It points to the last revision where the line was present. Then if the following revision is a plain commit, you are lucky and you got the deleting revision. OTOH, if the following revision is a merge commit, then things can get a little wild. As part of the effort to create difflame I tackled this very problem so if you already have python installed on your box and you are willing to give it a try, then don\'t wait any longer and let me know how it goes.https://github.com/eantoranz/difflame
