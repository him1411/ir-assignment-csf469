How do you check if a value is an Object in JavaScript?Try using typeof(var) and/or var instanceof something.EDIT: This answer gives an idea of how to examine variable\'s properties, but it is not a bulletproof recipe (after all there\'s no recipe at all!) for checking whether it\'s an object, far from it. Since people tend to look for something to copy from here without doing any research, I\'d highly recommend that they turn to the other, most upvoted (and correct!) answer.If typeof yourVariable === \'object\', it\'s an object or null. If you want to exclude null, just make it yourVariable !== null && typeof yourVariable === \'object\'.Let\'s define "object" in Javascript.  According to the MDN docs, every value is either an object or a primitive:primitive, primitive value A data that is not an object and does not have any methods. JavaScript has 5 primitive datatypes: string, number, boolean, null, undefined. What\'s a primitive?What\'s an object (i.e. not a primitive)?How to check whether a value is an objectinstanceof by itself won\'t work, because it misses two cases:typeof x === \'object\' won\'t work, because of false positives (null) and false negatives (functions):Object.prototype.toString.call won\'t work, because of false positives for all of the primitives:So I use:@Daan\'s answer also seems to work:because, according to the MDN docs:The Object constructor creates an object wrapper for the given value. If the value is null or undefined, it will create and return an empty object, otherwise, it will return an object of a type that corresponds to the given value. If the value is an object already, it will return the value.A third way that seems to work (not sure if it\'s 100%) is to use Object.getPrototypeOf which throws an exception if its argument isn\'t an object:Object.prototype.toString.call(myVar) will return:For more information on this and why it is a good alternative to typeof, check out this article.The official underscore.js uses this check to find out if something is really an objectI\'m fond of simply: If the item is a JS object, and it\'s not a JS array, and it\'s not null\xe2\x80\xa6if all three prove true, return true. If any of the three conditions fails, the && test will short-circuit and false will be returned. The null test can be omitted if desired (depending on how you use null).

As also posted here.isArray()isObject() - Note: use for Object literals only, as it returns false for custom objects, like new Date or new YourCustomObject.OK, let\'s give you this concept first before answering your question, in JavaScript Functions are Object, also null, Object, Arrays and even Date, so as you see it\'s not simple way like typeof obj === \'object\', so everything mentioned above will return true, but there are ways to check it with writing a function or using JavaScript frameworks, OK:Now, imagine you have this object that\'s a real object (not null or function or array):Pure JavaScript:or ororYou can simply use one of these functions as above in your code by calling them and it will return true if it\'s an object:If you are using a JavaScript framework, they usually have prepared these kind of functions for you, these are few of them:jQuery: Angular:Underscore and Lodash:It depends on what you mean with "is an object". If you want everything that is not a primitive, i.e. things that you can set new properties on, this should do the trick:It excludes the primitives (plain numbers/NaN/Infinity, plain strings, true/false, undefined and null) but should return true for everything else (including Number, Boolean and String objects). Note that JS does not define what "host" objects, such as window or console, should return when used with typeof, so those are hard to cover with a check like this.If you want to know whether something is a "plain" object, i.e. it was created as a literal {} or with Object.create(null), you might do this:The most reasonable way to check the type of a value seems the typeof operator. The only problem is that it\'s horribly broken:typeof is only reliable for non-null primitives. So a way to check if a value is an object would be ensuring that the string returned by typeof does not correspond to a primitive, and that the object is not null. However, the problem is that a future standard could introduce a new primitive type, and our code would consider it to be an object. New types don\'t appear frequently, but for example ECMAScript 6 introduced the Symbol type.Therefore, instead of typeof, I only recommend approaches whose result varies depending on if the value is an object or not. The following intends to be a Object constructorThe Object constructor coerces the passed argument to an object. If it\'s already an object, the same object is returned.Therefore, you can use it to coerce the value to an object, and strictly compare that object with the original value.The following function requires ECMAScript 3, which introduced ===:I like this approach because it\'s simple and self-descriptive, and an analogous check will also work for booleans, numbers and strings. However, be aware it relies on the global Object not being shadowed nor altered.ConstructorsWhen you instantiate a constructor, it can return a value different than the just-created instance. But that value will be ignored unless it\'s an object.The following function requires ECMAScript 3, which allowed constructors to return non-objects. Before ECMAScript 3 that threw an error, but try statements didn\'t exist back then.While a bit less simple than the previous example, this one does not rely on any global property, and thus might be the safest.this valueOld ECMAScript specifications required the this value to be an object. ECMAScript 3 introduced Function.prototype.call, which allowed to call a function with an arbitrary this value, but coerced to an object.ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode which removed this behavior, but in sloppy mode we still can (but arguably shouldn\'t) rely on it.[[Prototype]]All ordinary objects have an internal slot called [[Prototype]], whose value determines from which other object it inherits from. The value can only be an object or null. Therefore, you can attempt to create an object which inherits from the desired value, and check if it worked.Both Object.create and Object.getPrototypeOf require ECMAScript 5.Some new ECMAScript 6 waysECMAScript 6 introduces some new indirect ways to check is a value is an object. They use the previously seen approach to pass the value to some code which requires an object, wrapped inside a try statement to catch errors. Some hidden examples, not worth commentingNote: I intentionally skipped some approaches like Object.getPrototypeOf(value) (ES5) and Reflect methods (ES6) because they call essential internal methods which might do nasty things, e.g. if value is a proxy. For safety reasons my examples only reference value without accessing it directly.In Javascript, null, Object, Array, Date and functions are all objects. Although, null is bit contrived. So, it\'s better to check for the null first, to detect it\'s not null.Checking for typeof o === \'object\' guarantees that o is an object. Without this check, Object.prototype.toString would be meaningless, since it would return object for everthing, even for undefined and null! For example: toString(undefined) returns [object Undefined]!After typeof o === \'object\' check, toString.call(o) is a great method to check whether o is an object, a derived object like Array, Date or a function.In isDerivedObject function, it checks for the o is a function. Because, function also an object, that\'s why it\'s there. If it didn\'t do that, function will return as false. Example: isDerivedObject(function() {}) would return false, however now it returns true.One can always change the definition of what is an object. So, one can change these functions accordingly.Little late... for "plain objects" (i mean, like {\'x\': 5, \'y\': 7}) i have this little snippet:It generates the next output:It always works for me. If will return "true" only if the type of "o" is "object", but no null, or array, or function. \n:)I was asked to provide more details. Most clean and understandable way of checking if our variable is an object is typeof myVar. It returns a string with a type (e.g. "object", "undefined").Unfortunately either Array and null also have a type object. To take only real objects there is a need to check inheritance chain using instanceof operator. It will eliminate null, but Array has Object in inheritance chain.So the solution is:Try thisWhen everything else fails, I use this:lodash has isPlainObject, which might be what many who come to this page are looking for. It returns false when give a function or array.!!obj is shorthand for checking if object is truthy ( to filter out null/undefined) I think this would work. Function that returns true or false, possibly null.If you are already using AngularJS then it has a built in method which will check if its an object (without accepting null). What I like to use is thisI think in most of the cases a Date must pass the check as an Object, so I do not filter dates outi found a "new" way to do just this kind of type checking from this SO question: Why does instanceof return false for some literals?from that, i created a function for type checking as follows:then you can just do:this is tested on Chrome 56, Firefox 52, Microsoft Edge 38, Internet Explorer 11, Opera 43edit:\nif you also want to check if a variable is null or undefined, you can use this instead:update from inanc\'s comment: challenge accepted :Dif you want to loose compare objects you can try this way:that way, you can do just like inanc\'s comment:oruse typeof(my_obj) will tells which type of variable it is. if it is object will show \'object\'simple JS function,Eg:You can do this easily with toString() method of Object.prototypeorA little NodeJS console experiment based on the reading of Matt Fenwick\'s third option to his complete answer above. Just a little tweak to get true or false.The following return false for the object test.The object will return true.direct answer is ofcourse typeof v===\'object\' but this is terribly not useful. I wonder if the OP meant a plain dictionary ..try: I have a code snippet that works. I find it confusing when the whole piece of code is not given, so I just created it myself:
