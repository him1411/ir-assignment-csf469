I am trying to set up a project using Maven (m2eclipse), but I get this error in Eclipse:Description    Resource    Path    Location    Type\n  Could not calculate build plan: Failure to transfer org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:pom:2.0.2 from http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced. Original error: Could not transfer artifact org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:pom:2.0.2 from/to central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2): No response received after 60000   ExampleProject      Unknown Maven ProblemAny ideas?\nIt would be helpful if you could show me how to check if everything is configured fine...Remove all your failed downloads:For windows:Then rightclick on your project in eclipse and choose Maven->"Update Project ...", make sure "Update Dependencies" is checked in the resulting dialog and click OK.This worked for me in Windows as well. Try to executeor Run > Maven Clean and Maven > Update snapshots from project context menu in eclipseThanks for the replies, but after some more searching I was able to fix the problem. It turned out that I had to remove one of the "*.lastUpdated" which was preventing one of my plugins (Maven Surefire Plugin) from updating. I did this manually, because a maven clean wasn\'t doing it apparently.The problem was that the "*.lastUpdated" file for a plugin was blocking the maven check for updates and not allowing a necessary jar to get downloaded.In Eclipse:\nRight click the project->Maven->Update Project->Check checkbox "Force Update of Snapshots/Releases". Click OK.If you are behind a proxy, you have to update the settings.xml file (under the conf folder of your MAVEN_HOME, the file itself contains information about the proxy settings) and additionally you may need to update your Eclipse Network Settings (Window->Preferences...-> type Network Connections). Try using -X or --debug in order to get the debug output, this could provide additional information about the problem.It happened to me as Iam behind a firewall. The dependencies doesn\'t get downloaded sometimes when you are running in  Eclipse IDE. Make sure you use mvn clean install -U to resolve the problem. You would see the dependencies download after this. This worked for me in Windows:I had similar issue in Eclipse 3.6 with m2eclipse. Could not calculate build plan: Failure to transfer org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-resources-plugin:jar:2.4.3 from http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced. Original error: Could not transfer artifact org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-resources-plugin:jar:2.4.3 from central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2): ConnectException   project1 Unknown Maven ProblemDeleting all maven*.lastUpdated files from my local reository (as Deepak Joy suggested) solved that problem.In my case. The issues is same reason. I see the problem is on proxy and firewall. Here my solution\nFisrt ways: 1. install Proxy for Maven and Eclipse 2. Go to Locate the {user}/.m2/repository and Remove all the *.lastupdated files  3. Go back into Eclipse, Right-click on the project and select Maven > Update Project. > Select "Force Update of Snapshots/Releases". If the project is still exist error. example: here is my issues after all above stepI use this solution useful for me:\n 1. Find repository in https://mvnrepository.com/  2. Copy dependency to my *.poml of project  example \n3. Build project. the dependency missing will be downloaded to local repository.\n4. Go back into Eclipse, Right-click on the project and select Maven > Update Project. > Select "Force Update of Snapshots/Releases".   =>> Error is resolved 5. I remove dependencies at step 2 after finished and resolved. \nDoneIt Happened to me also you may have  two solue=tion for thisIf your project consist of some external or project specificdependency in it then you have to manually add it to your M2 repo folder which is located at C:\\Users\\Mohit.Singh.m2\\repository folder and then you have to run \nmvn eclipse:eclipse and then\nmvn clean install from the project folderif you do not have any wxternal or project sppecific dependency then you may import the project into eclipse as Existing maven project\nthen right click on project --> GO to maven --> Click on update project\na window will appear check the force snapshot download option and hit on OK I had a similar issue with only a few projects in my workspace.  Other projects with nearly identical POMs didn\'t have an error at all.  None of the other answers listed fixed my problem.  I finally stumbled upon removing/re-applying the Maven nature for each project and the errors disappeared:For each project that has a pom with the "resolution will not be reattempted..." error:just delete the archetype in maven local repository. As said above, it happens in case of failed archetype downloads.settings.xml for proxy?\nand in eclipse there are maven global\\local profile, add the settings.xmlGive correct maven setting.xml path in eclipse.Enter correct setting.xml path in user settings text boxFor me I just added the bellow xml code in the POM.xml file. And after I dit **right click in the project -> Maven -> Update Project and I checked Force Update of Snapshots/Releases ** and every thing worked Please Make sure that settings.XML file in the folder .m2 is valid first \nThen after clean the repository using below command in cmd
