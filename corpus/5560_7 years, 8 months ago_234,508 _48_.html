Given a string like: What kind of jQuery or JavaScript magic can be used to keep spaces to only one space max?Goal: Given that you also want to cover tabs, newlines, etc, just replace \\s\\s+ with \' \': If you really want to cover only spaces (and thus not tabs, newlines, etc), do so:Since you seem to be interested in performance, I profiled these with firebug.  Here are the results I got:This is on Firefox, running 100k string replacements.I encourage you to do your own profiling tests with firebug, if you think performance is an issue.  Humans are notoriously bad at predicting where the bottlenecks in their programs lie.(Also, note that IE 8\'s developer toolbar also has a profiler built in -- it might be worth checking what the performance is like in IE.) EDIT:\nIf you wish to replace all kind of whitespace characters the most efficient way would be like that:This is one solution, though it will target all space characters:Edit: This is probably better since it targets a space followed by 1 or more spaces:Alternative method:I didn\'t use /\\s+/ by itself since that replaces spaces that span 1 character multiple times and might be less efficient since it targets more than necessary.I didn\'t deeply test any of these so lmk if there are bugs.Also, if you\'re going to do string replacement remember to re-assign the variable/property to its own replacement, eg:Using jQuery.prototype.text:I have this method, I call it the Derp method for lack of a better name.Running it in JSPerf gives some surprising results.More robust:I suggestfor just spaces  ORfor turning multiple returns into a single return also.A more robust method: This takes care of also removing the initial and trailing spaces, if they exist. Eg:Your example didn\'t have those spaces but they are a very common scenario too, and the accepted answer was trimming even those into single spaces, like: " The ... RED! ", which is not what you will typically need.Here is an alternate solution if you do not want to use replace (replace spaces in a string without using replace javascript)Also a possibility:Comprehensive unencrypted answer for newbies et al.This is for all of the dummies like me who test the scripts written by some of you guys which do not work.The following 3 examples are the steps I took to remove special characters AND extra spaces on the following 3 websites (all of which work perfectly) {1. EtaVisa.com 2. EtaStatus.com 3. Tikun.com} so I know that these work perfectly.We have chained these together with over 50 at a time and NO problems.// This removed special characters + 0-9 and allows for just letters (upper and LOWER case)// This removed special characters and allows for just letters (upper and LOWER case) and 0-9 AND spaces// This removed special characters and allows for just letters (upper and LOWER case) and 0-9 AND spaces\n// The .replace(/\\s\\s+/g, " ") at the end removes excessive spaces\n// when I used single quotes, it did not work.::NEXT::\nSave #3 as a .js // I called mine NoDoubles.js::NEXT::\nInclude your JS into your page\n    <script language="JavaScript" src="js/NoDoubles.js"></script>::NEXT::\nInclude this in your form field:: such as <INPUT type="text" name="Name"> string \n     onKeyUp="NoDoublesPls3()" onKeyDown="NoDoublesPls3()" id="NoDoubles3"So that it looks like this\n    <INPUT type="text" name="Name" onKeyUp="NoDoublesPls3()" onKeyDown="NoDoublesPls3()" id="NoDoubles3">This will remove special characters, allow for single spaces and remove extra spaces.I know that I am late to the party, but I discovered a nice solution.Here it is:Jquery has trim() function which basically turns something like this "   FOo   Bar     " into "FOo Bar".It is much more usefull because it is automatically removes empty spaces at the beginning and at the end of string as well. No regex needed.Or if you also want to replace tabs:We can use the following regex explained with the help of sed system command. The similar regex can be used in other languages and platforms.Add the text into some file say testWe can use the following regex to replace all white spaces with single spaceHope this serves the purpose
