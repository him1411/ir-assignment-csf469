I have a problem with HTTP in Angular 2. I just want to GET a JSON list and show it in the view. And in the HallListComponent I call the getHalls method from the service:However, I got an EXCEPTION: TypeError: this.http.get(...).map is not a function in [null]Sorry for the long post...I think that you need to import this:Or more generally this if you want to have more methods for observables.\nWARNING: This will import all 50+ operators and add them to your application, thus affecting your bundle size and load times.See this issue for more details.Just some background... The newly minted Server Communication dev guide (finally) discusses/mentions/explains this:The RxJS library is quite large. Size matters when we build a production application and deploy it to mobile devices. We should include only those features that we actually need.Accordingly, Angular exposes a stripped down version of Observable in the rxjs/Observable module, a version that lacks almost all operators including the ones we\'d like to use here such as the map method.It\'s up to us to add the operators we need. We could add each operator, one-by-one, until we had a custom Observable implementation tuned precisely to our requirements.So as @Thierry already answered, we can just pull in the operators we need:Or, if we\'re lazy we can pull in the full set of operators. WARNING: this will add all 50+ operators to your app bundle, and will effect load timesUsing Observable.subscribe directly should work.Since Http service in angular2 returns an Observable type,\nFrom your Angular2 installation directory(\'node_modules\' in my case),We need to import map function of the Observable in your component using http service,as:
