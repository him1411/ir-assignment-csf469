Consider the following HTML:and the following CSS:As it stands, Firefox currently renders this similarly to the following:Notice that the fourth item was split between the second and third column. How do I prevent that?The desired rendering might look something more like:orEdit: The width is only specified to demonstrate the unwanted rendering. In the real case, of course there is no fixed width.The correct way to do this is with the break-inside CSS property:Unfortunately, no browser currently supports this.  With Chrome, I was able to use the following, but I couldn\'t make anything work for Firefox (See Bug 549114):The workaround you can do for Firefox if necessary is to wrap your non-breaking content in a table but that is a really, really terrible solution if you can avoid it.UPDATEAccording to the bug report mentioned above, Firefox 20+ supports page-break-inside: avoid as a mechanism for avoiding column breaks inside an element but the below code snippet demonstrates it still not working with lists:As others mention, you can do overflow: hidden or display: inline-block but this removes the bullets shown in the original question.  Your solution will vary based on what your goals are.UPDATE 2 Since Firefox does prevent breaking on display:table and display:inline-block a reliable but non-semantic solution would be to wrap each list item in its own list and apply the style rule there:Adding;to the child elements will prevent them being split between columns.set following to the style of the element that you don\'t want to break:As of October 2014, break-inside still seems to be buggy in Firefox and IE 10-11. However, adding overflow: hidden to the element, along with the break-inside: avoid, seems to make it work in Firefox and IE 10-11. I am currently using:Firefox now supports this:This solves the problem of elements breaking across columns.The accepted answer is now two years old and things appear to have changed.This article explains the use of the column-break-inside property.  I can\'t say how or why this differs from break-inside, because only the latter appears to be documented in the W3 spec.  However, the Chrome and Firefox support the following:This works for me in 2015 :Firefox 26 seems to requireAnd Chrome 32 needs I had the same problem i think and found a solution in this:Working also in FF 38.0.5: http://jsfiddle.net/rkzj8qnv/A possible workaround for Firefox is to set the CSS property "display" of the element you don\'t want to have a break inside to "table". I don\'t know if it works for the LI tag (you\'ll probably lose the list -item-style), but it works for the P tag.I just fixed some divs that were splitting onto the next column by adding to the child divs.*Realized it only fixes it in Firefox!I made an update of the actual answer.This seems to be working on firefox and chrome: \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/gatsbimantico/QJeB7/1/embedded/result/Note: The float property seems to be the one making the block behaviour.This answer might only apply to certain circumstances; If you set a height to your elements, this will be obeyed by the column styling. There-by keeping anything that is contained within that height to a row.I had a list, like the op, but it contained two elements, items and buttons to act upon those items. I treated it like a table <ul> - table, <li> - table-row, <div> - table-cell put the UL in a 4 column layout. The columns were sometimes being split between the item and it\'s buttons. The trick I used was to give the Div elements a line height to cover the buttons.The following code works to prevent column breaks inside elements:
