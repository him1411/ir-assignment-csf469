I want to define a two-dimensional array without an initialized length like this :but it does not work...I\'ve tried the code below, but it is wrong too:Error:What is my mistake?You\'re technically trying to index an uninitialized array. You have to first initialize the outer list with lists before adding items; Python calls this\n"list comprehension".Although you can name them as you wish, I look at it this way to avoid some confusion that could arise with the indexing, if you use "x" for both the inner and outer lists, and want a non-square Matrix.If you really want a matrix, you might be better off using numpy. Other ways (with output removed for compactness):Note that many people recommend against using matrix since an array is more flexible, but I thought I\'d include it since we\'re talking about matrices.Here is a shorter notation for initializing a list of lists:Unfortunately shortening this to something like 5*[5*[0]] doesn\'t really work because you end up with 5 copies of the same list, so when you modify one of them they all change, for example:If you want to create an empty matrix, the correct syntax isAnd if you want to generate a matrix of size 5 filled with 0, If all you want is a two dimensional container to hold some elements, you could conveniently use a dictionary instead:Then you can do:This works because 1,2 is a tuple, and you\'re using it as a key to index the dictionary. The result is similar to a dumb sparse matrix.Edit: As indicated by osa and Josap Valls, you can also use Matrix = collections.defaultdict(lambda:0) so that the missing elements have a default value of 0.Vatsal further points that this method is probably not very efficient for large matrices, and should only be used in non performance-critical parts of the code.In Python you will be creating a list of lists.  You do not have to declare the dimensions ahead of time, but you can.  For example:Now matrix[0][0] == 2 and matrix[1][0] == 3.  You can also use the list comprehension syntax.  This example uses it twice over to build a "two-dimensional list":You should make a list of lists, the best way is use nested comprehensions:On your [5][5] example, you are creating a list with an integer "5" inside, and try to access its 5th item, and that naturally raises an IndexError because there is no 5th item.:To declare a matrix of zeros (ones):e.g.or\n    numpy.ones((x, y))\ne.g.Even three dimensions are possible.\n(http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~warner/prog/python.html see --> Multi-dimensional arrays)The accepted answer is good and correct, but it took me a while to understand that I could also use it to create a completely empty array.results inA rewrite for easy reading:I read in comma separated files like this:The list "data" is then a list of lists with index data[row][col]Be careful about this short expression, see full explanation down in @F.J\'s answerI\'m on my first python script and I was a little confused by the square matrix example so I hope the below example will help you save some time:so thatyou can define keys and values in two ways:orresult  Why not The *5 for the first dimension works because at this level the data is immutable.I do think numpy is the way to go. The above is a generic one if you don\'t want to use numpy. if you want to be able to think it as a 2D array rather than being forced to think in term of a list of lists (much more natural in my opinion), you can do the following: the result is a list (not a numpy array), and you can overwrite the individual positions with numbers, strings, whateverIf you don\'t have size information before start then create 2 one one dimensional list.\nlist 1 : To store rows\nlist 2 : actual 2 dimensional matrix\nStore entire row in 1st list once done append list 1 into list 2.Output :Using numpy you can initialize empty matrix like this:And later append data like this:
