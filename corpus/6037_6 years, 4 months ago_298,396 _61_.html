I\'m developing a part of an application that\'s responsible for exporting some data into CSV files. The application always uses UTF-8 because of its multilingual nature at all levels. But opening such CSV files (containing e.g. diacritics, cyrillic letters, Greek letters) in Excel does not achieve the expected results showing something like \xd0\x93\xe2\x80\x9e/\xd0\x93\xc2\xa4, \xd0\x93\xe2\x80\x93/\xd0\x93\xc2\xb6. And I don\'t know how to force Excel understand that the open CSV file is encoded in UTF-8. I also tried specifying UTF-8 BOM EF BB BF, but Excel ignores that.Is there any workaround?P.S. Which tools may potentially behave like Excel does?UPDATEI have to say that I\'ve confused the community with the formulation of the question. When I was asking this question, I asked for a way of opening a UTF-8 CSV file in Excel without any problems for a user, in a fluent and transparent way. However, I used a wrong formulation asking for doing it automatically. That is very confusing and it clashes with VBA macro automation. There are two answers for this questions that I appreciate the most: the very first answer by Alex https://stackoverflow.com/a/6002338/166589, and I\'ve accepted this answer; and the second one by Mark https://stackoverflow.com/a/6488070/166589 that have appeared a little later. From the usability point of view, Excel seemed to have lack of a good user-friendly UTF-8 CSV support, so I consider both answers are correct, and I have accepted Alex\'s answer first because it really stated that Excel was not able to do that transparently. That is what I confused with automatically here. Mark\'s answer promotes a more complicated way for more advanced users to achieve the expected result. Both answers are great, but Alex\'s one fits my not clearly specified question a little better.UPDATE 2Five months later after the last edit, I\'ve noticed that Alex\'s answer has disappeared for some reason. I really hope it wasn\'t a technical issue and I hope there is no more discussion on which answer is greater now. So I\'m accepting Mark\'s answer as the best one.Alex is correct, but as you have to export to csv, you can give the users this advice when opening the csv files:This way the special characters should show correctly.   The UTF-8 Byte-order marker will clue Excel 2007+ in to the fact that you\'re using UTF-8. (See this SO post).In case anybody is having the same issues I was, .NET\'s UTF8 encoding class does not output a byte-order marker even when its constructor is explicitly told to. You have to use this workaround if you want to really save it with a byte-order marker.The bug with ignored BOM seems to be fixed for Excel 2013. I had same problem with Cyrillic letters, but adding BOM character \\uFEFF did help.We have used this workaround:  Had the same problems with PHP-generated CSV files. \nExcel ignored the BOM when the Separator was defined via "sep=,\\n" at the beginning of the content (but of course after the BOM).So adding a BOM ("\\xEF\\xBB\\xBF") at the beginning of the content and setting the semicolon as separator via fputcsv($fh, $data_array, ";"); does the trick.It is incredible that there are so many answers but none answers the question: "When I was asking this question, I asked for a way of opening a UTF-8\n  CSV file in Excel without any problems for a user,..."The answer marked as the accepted answer with 200+ up-votes is useless for me because I don\'t want to give my users a manual how to configure Excel.\nApart from that: this manual will apply to one Excel version but other Excel versions have different menus and configuration dialogs. You would need a manual for each Excel version.So the question is how to make Excel show UTF8 data with a simple double click?Well at least in Excel 2007 this is not possible if you use CSV files because the UTF8 BOM is ignored and you will see only garbage. This is already part of the question of Lyubomyr Shaydariv:   "I also tried specifying UTF-8 BOM EF BB BF, but Excel ignores that."I make the same experience: Writing russian or greek data into a UTF8 CSV file with BOM results in garbage in Excel:Content of UTF8 CSV file:Result in Excel 2007:A solution is to not use CSV at all. This legacy format is completely deprecated alone by the fact, that it depends on the region settings in control panel if comma or semicolon is used as separator, which is the most stupid misdesign in Excel. So the same CSV file may open correctly on one computer but on anther computer not. "CSV" means "Comma Separated Values" but for example on a german Windows by default semicolon must be used as separator while comma does not work. This contradicts the name of the file format. Excel exists since decades. It is a shame that Microsoft was not able to implement such a basic thing as CSV import in all these years.If you put the same values into a HTML file and save that file as UTF8 file with BOM with the file extension XLS you will get the correct result.Content of UTF8 XLS file:Result in Excel 2007:You can even use colors in HTML which Excel will show correctly.Result in Excel 2007:I have had the same issue in the past (how to produce files that Excel can read, and other tools can also read). I was using TSV rather than CSV, but the same problem with encodings came up.I failed to find any way to get Excel to recognize UTF-8 automatically, and I was not willing/able to inflict on the consumers of the files complicated instructions how to open them. So I encoded them as UTF-16le (with a BOM) instead of UTF-8. Twice the size, but Excel can recognize the encoding. And they compress well, so the size rarely (but sadly not never) matters.Old question but heck, the simplest solution is:This is an old question but comes up in the search at top. I found after a lot of efforts that adding BOM characters at the beginning of csv file helps.I have briefed it here: https://sites.google.com/site/ritechtips/home/the-multi-line-fields-csv-file-and-excel-import---ha Simple vba macro for opening utf-8 text and csv filesOrigin:=65001  is UTF-8.\nComma:True  for .csv files distributed in columsSave it in Personal.xlsb to have it always available.\nPersonalise excel toolbar adding a macro call button and open files from there.\nYou can add more formating to the macro, like column autofit , alignment,etc.Just for help users interested on opening the file on Excel that achieve this thread like me.I have used the wizard below and it worked fine for me, importing an UTF-8 file.\nNot transparent, but useful if you already have the file.Source: https://www.itg.ias.edu/content/how-import-csv-file-uses-utf-8-character-encoding-0This is an old question but I\'ve just encountered had a similar problem and the solution may help others:Had the same issue where writing out CSV text data to a file, then opening the resulting .csv in Excel shifts all the text into a single column. After having a read of the above answers I tried the following, which seems to sort the problem out.Apply an encoding of UTF-8 when you create your StreamWriter. That\'s it.Example:This is my working solution:The key is Origin:=65001Yes it is possible.  When writing the stream creating the csv, the first thing to do is this:A truly amazing list of answers, but since one pretty good one is still missing, I\'ll mention it here: open the csv file with google sheets and save it back to your local computer as an excel file.In contrast to Microsoft, Google has managed to support UTF-8 csv files so it just works to open the file there. And the export to excel format also just works. So even though this may not be the preferred solution for all, it is pretty fail safe and the number of clicks is not as high as it may sound, especially when you\'re already logged into google anyway.If you want to make it fully automatic, one click, or to load automatically into Excel from say a web page, but can\'t generate proper Excel files, then I would suggest looking at SYLK format as an alternative.  OK it is not as simple as CSV but it is text based and very easy to implement and it supports UTF-8 with no issues. I wrote a PHP class that receives the data and outputs a SYLK file which will open directly in Excel by just clicking the file (or will auto-launch Excel if you write the file to a web page with the correct mime type. You can even add formatting (like bold, format numbers in particular ways etc) and change column sizes, or auto size columns to the text in the columns and all in all the code is probably not more than about 100 lines.It is dead easy to reverse engineer SYLK by creating a simple spreadsheet and saving as SYLK and then reading it with a text editor.  The first block are headers and standard number formats that you will recognise (which you just regurgitate in every file you create), then the data is simply an X/Y coordinate and a value.Yes, this is possible. As previously noted by multiple users, there seems to be a problem with excel reading the correct Byte Order Mark when the file is encoded in UTF-8. With UTF-16 it does not seem to have a problem, so it is endemic to UTF-8. The solution I use for this is adding the BOM, TWICE. For this I execute the following sed command twice: , where the wildcard can be replaced with any file name. However, this leads to a mutation of the sep= at the beginning of the .csv file. The .csv file will then open normally in excel, but with an extra row with "sep=" in the first cell. \nThe "sep=" can also be removed in the source .csv itself, but when opening the file with VBA the delimiter should be specified:Format 6 is the .csv format. Set Local to true, in case there are dates in the file. If Local is not set to true the dates will be Americanized, which in some cases will corrupt the .csv format. First save the Excel spreadsheet as Unicode text. Open the TXT file using Internet explorer and click "Save as" TXT Encoding - choose the appropriate encoding, i.e. for Win Cyrillic 1251
