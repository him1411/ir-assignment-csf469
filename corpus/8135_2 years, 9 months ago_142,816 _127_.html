I am unable to start my Android Studio for Android development on Mac OS (10.10.1 - Yosemite)Open the application package for Android Studio in finder, and edit the Info.plist file. Change the key JVMversion. Put 1.6+ instead of 1.6*. That worked for me!.Cheers!Edited:While this was necessary in older versions of Android Studio, this is no longer recommended. See the official statement "Please note: Do not edit Info.plist to pick a different version. That will break not only the application signature, but also future patch updates to your installation." Antonio Jose\'s answer is the correct one.Thanks aried3r!Just install this guy herehttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_USand you should be good. [Update]\nThis is fixed in Android Studio 1.1\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37015035In the next version of Android Studio, if no java 6 is found but 7 (or greater) is found then it will use that instead. We still recommend running studio with Java 6 due to improved font rendering, but there is no work around needed if, for example, only java 8 is found.  [End Update]From Android Studio 1.0 RC3 NotesAs of RC 3, we have a better mechanism for customizing properties for the launchers on all three platforms. You should not edit any files in the IDE installation directory. Instead, you can customize the attributes by creating your own .properties or .vmoptions files in the following directories. (This has been possible on some platforms before, but it required you to copy and change the entire contents of the files. With the latest changes these properties are now additive instead such that you can set just the attributes you care about, and the rest will use the defaults from the IDE installation).However there is no explanation about what options are.After searching a little I found this\nAdjusting VM Options for Android Studio on Mac\nIntelliJ IDEA 14.0.0 Web Help/File IDEA.PropertiesHowever no luck with that.Fortunately I was able to resolve it on Yosemite using environment variables as said in the 1.0 RC3 Release Notes.You can also place use environment variables to point to specific override files elsewhere:\n  STUDIO_VM_OPTIONS, which vmoptions file to use\n  STUDIO_PROPERTIES, which property file to use\n  STUDIO_JDK, which JDK to run studio withThis was a little tricky because Android Studio is not a command line application so I had to use a AppleScript command to set the environment variable when login. More info hereThis is my launchctl command for the command line.  And this my AppleScript (remember to save it as an Application)  About launchctl, see hereNote that this last variable allows you to for example run Android Studio with Java 7 on OSX (which normally picks Java 6 from the version specified in Info.plist):$ export STUDIO_JDK=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_67.jdk$ open /Applications/Android\\ Studio.appWorked for meChange this key in the Info.plist I changed fromtoand it worked fine now..Edited:\nPer the official statement as mentioned above by hasternet and aried3r, the solution by Antonio Jose is correct.Thanks!As a novice user it took me a while to understand how to fix this in a correct way. After searching and understating many answers on SO I came out with the Following steps that you need to follow to fix the issue.Please Note:Although the simplest solution is to update the Info.plist of android studio . But it is not recommended and not the correct way to fix it .Official statement- "Please note: Do not edit Info.plist to pick a different version. That will break not only the application signature, but also future patch updates to your installation."First Solution : If you run your Android Studio from command line, you can add these two lines into your .bash_profile From next time whenever you open your terminal your studio will start automatically.Second Solution: If you want to run Android Studio from UI(by click on Icon) follow below steps:Copy past the below linedo shell script "launchctl setenv STUDIO_JDK /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk"Note :- Change the jdk version according to your version. To check which version you are using open terminal and run the following command 3.Now save (\xe2\x8c\x98+s) as File format: Application. Finally open System Settings \xe2\x86\x92 Users & Groups \xe2\x86\x92 Login Items and add your new application that you have just created.woolaaaa\xe2\x80\xa6Its done.References :Antonio Jose\'s answerruario\'s answerI am using Mac OS X 10.10 also. And to fix this problem.Search and replace:replaced by:That\'s it!On Mac OS X Yosemite just install:Java SE Development Kit 8and Java Version 8 Update 25It\'s all, work for me!Set envirionment variable STUDIO_JDK (java_home outputs the Java home dir and sed strips two folders to get the jdk dir)launchctl setenv STUDIO_JDK `/usr/libexec/java_home -version 1.8 | sed \'s/\\/Contents\\/Home//g\'`\nLaunch Android Studio like you would normallyThe above steps only works for the current session. Here is how to create a plist file in /Library/LaunchDaemons that runs the above command on every boot:Found out about the plist trick thanks to http://www.dowdandassociates.com/blog/content/howto-set-an-environment-variable-in-mac-os-x-launchd-plist/On Android Tools Project Site, there is a great explanation Mac OSX JDK Selection. It fixed my problem. In summary:Android Studio requires two different JDKs:These two can be (and usually are) the same, but you can configure\n  them individually. And on OSX in particular, they will often be\n  different.and for Yosemite (Mac OSX 10.10) Issues:First, please make sure that you have the latest version of Java 6\n  installed; in some cases that has fixed the problems:\n  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572If not, try running a recent version of Java 7 or Java 8 instead by\n  setting STUDIO_JDK as described above. That is reported to have fixed\n  the other problems (though you will get the font rendering shown for\n  Java 8 above.)Java was uninstalled when I updated to OS X El Capitan.  See screenshot of terminal before and after I reinstalled Java.  To reinstall Java I followed this link that was provided in the Android Studio dialog box. Android Studio ran again after the Java installation was reinstalled. Edit the android studio\'s Info.plist file in the package so that it uses 1.7 or whatever JVMVersion you have installed. Changing the JVMVersion to 1.6+ instead of 1.6* as hasternet answered above should work too.The above works but is not recommended see RC3 Release Notes As of RC 3, we have a better mechanism for customizing properties for\n  the launchers on all three platforms. You should not edit any files in\n  the IDE installation directory. Instead, you can customize the\n  attributes by creating your own .properties or .vmoptions files in the\n  following directories.

With the latest changes these properties are now additive\n  instead such that you can set just the attributes you care about, and\n  the rest will use the defaults from the IDE installation).see Android Studio failed to load JVM on Mac OSX (Mavericks)I have same problem and fixed with this way:You should install Java from Official Apple page.http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572This one work for me, very simple, just export the environmentable var. but make sure u have the valid JVM first though.https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=82378On Mac OS X Yosemite just install:Java SE Development Kit 8andJava Version 8 Update 25It\'s all, work for me too! like gehev said , so simple !You can implement the STUDIO_JDK solution using your user\'s launch agents. This involves creating one plist file in your LaunchAgents directory, located at ~/Library/LaunchAgents Create a new file, ~/Library/LaunchAgents/UNIQUE_KEY.plist, where UNIQUE_KEY is just an identifier. I use com.username.androidstudio.Copy the following text into your new plist file and modify it according the instructions below.You will need to make two modifications:This is the same underlying solution as Antonio Jose\'s answer. It sets the STUDIO_JDK environment variable based on the Android Studio version 1.0 RC3 release notes. This solution uses the LaunchAgents directory rather than AppleScript to set the environment variable. As such it is mostly a difference in how your order and organize your system and environment variables.Do not edit the plist. These instructions worked for me the first time I installed Android Studio a few months ago as well as just today. (1/21/2015)All you need to do is a few simple things, although they aren\'t really listed on Google\'s website.As @Gerard suggested, I summerise my original comment (https://stackoverflow.com/a/27370525/763459)  as an Answer, hope it can help others who are annoyed by this issue.There\'s a way without running the AppleScript: \nedit .bash_profile (if this file doesn\'t exist, please create a new one , as @Gerard suggested, you can to use source .bash_profile for the first time).Install the legacy Java (may be neccessary) http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572Put export STUDIO_JDK /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_31.jdkThen quit terminal (or any text editors you\'re using to edit this file), run the Android Studio and violaTested with OSX 10.10 and Android 1.0.1   Android Studio will read settings from the file ~/Library/Preferences/AndroidStudio/idea.properties.  I created this file and in it have the path to my jdk :STUDIO_JDK=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_45.jdkNo editing of the Info.plist necessary!"On Mac OS, run Android Studio with Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 for optimized font rendering. You can then configure your project to use Java Development Kit (JDK) 6 or JDK 7."This was listed in http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html under the system requirements for Mac OS X.Once you install Java 6 (not the JDK) from Apple as per Alonso C. Licks, you should be able to open Android Studio and reconfigure as you wish without having to mess around in the terminal, info.plist file, or other libraries.I have downloaded Intellij Idea. When I try to install Intellij, a pop-up appeared that my Mac is missing with Java RE, do you want to download it? After I downloaded missing package using Intellij, I could open Android Studio. I resolved this issue by changing the JVM version in the Info.plist file to 1.7*I ran this bad boy:i\'m dealing with the same problem and i get it worked.it is probably that your jdk version is not right.now i installed jdk1.8 and it is ok now.For those who were having trouble creating a script that launched on startup, as an alternative you can add this .plist to your LaunchAgents folder. This may be a more appropriate way of adding environment variables to the system since Yosemite decided to do away with launchd.conf. This should also work across user accounts due to the nature of the LaunchAgents folder, but I haven\'t tested that.To do this, create a .plist file with the following name and path:and the contents:Then change file properties by running the following commands in Terminal:Notes:1) You may need to change \'jdk1.8.0_25.jdk\' to match the version that you have on your computer.2) I tried to use "jdk1.8.*.jdk" to try and account for varying Java * versions, but when I opened Android Studio I got the no JVM error even though if you run "echo $STUDIO_JDK" it returns the correct path. Perhaps someone has some insight as to how to fix that issue.Try downloading the Java from Apple Support Page: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572 if that doesn\'t work for you or fails to load (very common issue), just follow this link to download and install the Java version you need:http://support.apple.com/downloads/DL1572/en_US/JavaForOSX2014-001.dmgThat\'s it.I had previously uninstall Java 6 and install Java 7, Android Studio was working okay, then I upgraded Android Studio and I had the issue everyone is having.  Today, I uninstalled Java 7 and installed Java 8 from Oracle.  Then I uninstall Android Studio and installed the latest.  Everything is working for me nowI was able to get it to work by editing the info.plist changing 16* to 16+. Tried using the recommended method but that failed.
