Can anyone please explain, what is setup.py and how can it be configured or used?setup.py is a python file, which usually tells you that the module/package you are about to install has been packaged and distributed with Distutils, which is the standard for distributing Python Modules.This allows you to easily install Python packages. Often it\'s enough to write:and the module will install itself.http://docs.python.org/install/index.htmlsetup.py is Python\'s answer to a multi-platform installer and make file. If you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with command line installations, then make && make install translates to python setup.py build && python setup.py install. Some packages are pure Python, and are only byte compiled. Others may contain native code, which will require a native compiler (like gcc or cl) and a Python interfacing module (like swig or pyrex).If you downloaded package that has "setup.py" in root folder, you can install it by runningIf you are developing a project and are wondering what this file is useful for, check Python documentation on writing the Setup ScriptIt helps to install a python package foo on your machine (can also be in virtualenv) so that you can import the package foo from other projects and also from Python prompt.  It does the similar job of pip, easy_install etc.,Using setup.py Let\'s start with some definitions:Package - A folder/directory that contains __init__.py file.\nModule  - A valid python file with .py extension.\nDistribution - How one package relates to others.  Let\'s say you want to install a package named foo. Then you do,  Instead, if you don\'t want to actually install it but still would like to use it. Then do,  This command will create symlinks to the source directory within site-packages instead of copying things. Because of this, it is quite fast (particularly for large packages).  Creating setup.py If you have your package tree like,  Then, you do the following so that it can be installed on some machine:  Instead if your package tree is more complex like:  In this case your setup.py would look be,Add more stuff to (setup.py) & make it decent:The long_description is used in pypi.org as the README description of your package.  And, you\'re ready to upload your package to PyPi.org so that others can install your package using pip install yourpackage.  First step is to claim your package name & space in pypi using:Once registered, nobody can use your package name. After this, you have to upload your package there (to the cloud) by,Optionally, you can also sign your package with GPG by,setup.py is a Python script that is usually shipped with libraries or programs, written in that language. It\'s purpose is the correct installation of the software.Many packages use the distutils framework in conjuction with setup.py.http://docs.python.org/distutils/setup.py can be used in two scenarios , First, you want to install a Python package. Second, you want to create your own Python package. Usually standard Python package has couple of important files like setup.py, setup.cfg and Manifest.in. When you are creating the Python package, these three files will determine the (content in PKG-INFO under egg-info folder) name, version, description, other required installations (usually in .txt file) and few other parameters. setup.cfg is read by setup.py while package is created (could be tar.gz ). Manifest.in is where you can define what should be included in your package. Anyways you can do bunch of stuff using setup.py like There are bunch of other commands which could be used with setup.py . for help When you download a package with setup.py open your Terminal (Mac,Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows). Using cd  and helping you with Tab button set the path right to the folder where you have downloaded the file and where there is setup.py :Press enter, you should see something like this:Then type after this python setup.py install :Press enter. Done!To install a Python package you\'ve downloaded, you extract the archive and run the setup.py script inside:To me, this has always felt odd. It would be more natural to point a package manager at the download, as one would do in Ruby and Nodejs, eg. gem install rails-4.1.1.gemA package manager is more comfortable too, because it\'s familiar and reliable. On the other hand, each setup.py is novel, because it\'s specific to the package. It demands faith in convention "I trust this setup.py takes the same commands as others I have used in the past". That\'s a regrettable tax on mental willpower. I\'m not saying the setup.py workflow is less secure than a package manager (I understand Pip just runs the setup.py inside), but certainly I feel it\'s awkard and jarring. There\'s a harmony to commands all being to the same package manager application. You might even grow fond it.
