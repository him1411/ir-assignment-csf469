I have a element that already has a class:Now I want to create a javascript function that will add a class to the div (not replace, but add).How can I do that?Add a space plus the name of your new class to the className property of the element. First, put an id on the element so you can easily get a reference.Then See also element.className on MDN.The easiest way to do this without any framework is to use element.classList.add method.I prefer not having to add any empty space and duplicate entry handling myself (which is required when using the document.className approach). There are some browser limitations, but you can work around them using polyfills.find your target element "d" however you wish and then:you can wrap that in cleverer ways to check pre-existence, and check for space requirements etc..Cross CompatibleIn the following example we add a classname to the <body> element.  This is IE-8 compatible.This is shorthand for the following..PerformanceIf your more concerned with performance over cross-compatibility you can shorten it to the following which is 4% faster.ConvenienceAlternatively you could use jQuery but the resulting performance is significantly slower.  94% slower according to jsPerfPerformanceUsing jQuery selectively is the best method for removing a class if your concerned with performanceWithout jQuery it\'s 32% slowerAnother approach to add the class to element using pure JavaScriptFor adding class:For removing class:When the work I\'m doing doesn\'t warrant using a library, I use these two functions:Assuming you\'re doing more than just adding this one class (eg, you\'ve got asynchronous requests and so on going on as well), I\'d recommend a library like Prototype or jQuery.This will make just about everything you\'ll need to do (including this) very simple.So let\'s say you\'ve got jQuery on your page now, you could use code like this to add a class name to an element (on load, in this case):Check out the jQuery API browser for other stuff.You can use the classList.add OR classList.remove method to add/remove a class from a element.The above code will add(and NOT replace) a class "anyclass" to nameElem.\nSimilarly you can use classList.remove() method to remove a class.To add a class to an element, without removing/affecting existing values, append a space and the new classname, like so:To replace all existing classes with one or more new classes, set the className attribute:(You can use a space-delimited list to apply multiple classes.)Just to elaborate on what others have said, multiple CSS classes are combined in a single string, delimited by spaces. Thus, if you wanted to hard-code it, it would simply look like this:From there you can easily derive the javascript necessary to add a new class... just append a space followed by the new class to the element\'s className property. Knowing this, you can also write a function to remove a class later should the need arise.To add, remove or check element classes in a simple way:If you don\'t want to use jQuery and want to support older browsers:I know IE9 is shutdown officially and we can achieve it with element.classList as many told above but I just tried to learn how it works without classList with help of many answers above I could learn it.Below code extends many answers above and improves them by avoiding adding duplicate classes.Sample with pure JS. In first example we get our element\'s id and add e.g. 2 classes.In second example we get element\'s class name and add 1 more.    I think it\'s better to use pure JavaScript, which we can run on the DOM of the Browser.Here is the functional way to use it. I have used ES6 but feel free to use ES5 and function expression or function definition, whichever suits your JavaScript StyleGuide.first, give the div an id. Then, call function appendClass:You can use the API querySelector to select your element and then create a function with the element and the new classname as parameters. Using classlist for modern browsers, else for IE8. Then you can call the function after an event. For those using Lodash and wanting to update className string:This js code works for meprovides classname replacementTo add just useTo remove useHope this is helpful to sombodyIn YUI, if you include yuidom, you can use \nYAHOO.util.Dom.addClass(\'div1\',\'className\');\nHTHthis will toggle the class you want to toggle without jQuery
