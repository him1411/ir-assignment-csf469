This error message is being presented, any suggestions?Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate\n  43148176 bytes) in phpAt last I found the answer:Just add this below line to before line of you getting error in your fileini_set(\'memory_limit\', \'-1\');It will take unlimited memory usage of server, it\'s working fine.Thanks for giving suggestion friends.Here are two simple methods to increase the limit on shared hosting:If you have access to your PHP.ini file, change the line in PHP.ini\nIf your line shows 32M try 64M:\nmemory_limit = 64M ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (64MB)If you don\'t have access to PHP.ini try adding this to an .htaccess file:\nphp_value memory_limit 64MYour script is using too much memory. This can often happen in PHP if you have a loop that has run out of control and you are creating objects or adding to arrays on each pass of the loop. Check for infinite loops.If that isn\'t the problem, try and help out PHP by destroying objects that you are finished with by setting them to null. eg. $OldVar = null;Check the code where the error actually happens as well. Would you expect that line to be allocating a massive amount of memory? If not, try and figure out what has gone wrong...Doing :is never good. If you want to read a very large file, it is a best practise to copy it bit by bit. Try the following code for best practise.It is unfortunately easy to program in PHP in a way that consumes memory faster than you realise. Copying strings, arrays and objects instead of using references will do it, though PHP 5 is supposed to do this more automatically than in PHP 4. But dealing with your data set in entirety over several steps is also wasteful compared to processing the smallest logical unit at a time. The classic example is working with large resultsets from a database: most programmers fetch the entire resultset into an array and then loop over it one or more times with foreach(). It is much more memory efficient to use a while() loop to fetch and process one row at a time. The same thing applies to processing a file. If you want to read large files, you should read them bit by bit instead of reading them at once.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s simple math: If you read a 1 MB large file at once, than at least 1 MB of memory is needed at the same time to hold the data.So you should read them bit by bit using fopen & fread.You can increase the memory allowed to php script by executing the following line above all the codes in the script:And also de allocate the unwanted variables in the script.Check this php library : Freeing memory with PHP I was also having the same problem, looked for phpinfo.ini, php.ini or .htaccess files to no avail. Finally I have looked at some php files, opened them and checked the codes inside for memory. Finally this solution was what I come out with and it worked for me. I was using wordpress, so this solution might only work for wordpress memory size limit problem.\nMy solution, open default-constants.php file in /public_html/wp-includes folder. Open that file with code editor, and find memory settings under wp_initial_constants scope, or just Ctrl+F it to find the word "memory". There you will come over WP_MEMORY_LIMIT and WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT. Just increase it, it was 64 MB in my case, I increased it to 128 MB and then to 200 MB. Btw, please don\'t do the following code, because that\'s bad practice:We had a similar situation and we tried out given at the top of the answers\nini_set(\'memory_limit\', \'-1\');\nand everything worked fine, compressed images files greater than 1MB to KBs. wordpress users add line:@ini_set(\'memory_limit\', \'-1\');in wp-settings.php which you can find in the wordpress installed root folderIf you are trying to read a file, that will take up memory in PHP. For instance, if you are trying to open up and read an MP3 file ( like, say, $data = file("http://mydomain.com/path/sample.mp3" ) it is going to pull it all into memory.As Nelson suggests, you can work to increase your maximum memory limit if you actually need to be using this much memory.Writeini_set(\'memory_limit\', \'-1\');in your index.php at the top after opening of php tag \n    I hadn\'t renewed my hosting and the database was read-only. Joomla needed to write the session and couldn\'t do it.
