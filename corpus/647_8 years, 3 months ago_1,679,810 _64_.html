I have checked my PHP ini file and display errors is set and also error reporting is E_ALL. I have restarted my Apache web server.I have even put these lines at the top of my script, and it doesn\'t even catch simple parse errors. For example, I declare variables with a "$" and I don\'t close statements";". But all my scripts show a blank page on these errors, but I want to actually see the errors in my browser output. What is left to do?This always works for me:However, this doesn\'t make PHP to show parse errors - the only way to show those errors is to modify your php.ini with this line:You can\'t catch parse errors when enabling error output at runtime, because it parses the file before actually executing anything (and since it encounters an error during this, it won\'t execute anything). You\'ll need to change the actual server configuration so that display_errors is on and the approriate error_reporting level is used. If you don\'t have access to php.ini, you may be able to use .htaccess or similar, depending on the server.This question may provide additional info.Inside your php.ini:Then restart your web server.To display all errors you need to:1. Have these lines in the PHP script you\'re calling from the browser (typically index.php):2.(a) Make sure that this script has no syntax errors\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x942.(b) Set display_errors = On in your php.iniOtherwise, it can\'t even run those 2 lines!You can check for syntax errors in your script by running (at the command line):If you include the script from another PHP script then it will display syntax errors in the included script.  For example:index.phpmy_script.phpSome web hosting providers allow you to change PHP params in the .htaccess file.You can add the following line:I had the same issue as yours and this solution fixed it.This will work:Use:This is the best way to write it, but a syntax error gives blank output, so use the console to check for syntax errors. The best way to debug PHP code is to use the console; run the following:You might find all of the settings for "error reporting" or "display errors" do not appear to work in PHP 7. That is because error handling has changed. Try this instead:Or, to catch exceptions and errors in one go (this is not backward compatible with PHP 5):Create a file called php.ini in the folder where your PHP file resides.Inside php.ini add the following code (I am giving an simple error showing code):Here is a PHP script:For a more detailed explanation of PHP errors, visit PHP Error - error_reporting().When using PHP as an Apache module, we can a change the configuration settings using directives in Apache configuration files (e.g. httpd.conf) and .htaccess files. You will need \xe2\x80\x9cAllowOverride Options\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cAllowOverride All\xe2\x80\x9d privileges to do so.Check this http://funbird.co.uk/blog/tech-articals/linux-tech-articals/enabling-error-display-php-via-htaccessIf you somehow find yourself in a situation where you can\'t modifiy the setting via php.ini or .htaccess you\'re out of luck for displaying errors when your PHP scripts contain parse errors. You\'d then have to resolve to linting the files on the command line like this:If your host is so locked down that it does not allow changing the value via php.ini or .htaccess, it may also disallow changing the value via ini_set. You can check that with the following PHP script:If, despite following all of the above answers (or you can\'t edit your php.ini file), you still can\'t get an error message, try making a new PHP file that enables error reporting and then include the problem file. eg:Despite having everything set properly in my php.ini file, this was the only way I could catch a namespace error. My exact scenario was:You can do something like below : Set below parameters in your main index file     Then based on your requirement you can choose which you want to show :For All Error, Warning and Notice For All ErrorsFor All WarningsFor All NoticeFor More Info check hereI would usually go with the following code in my plain php project which are very small, if the project grows large then I will recommend.Hope this helps.As we are now running PHP7, answers given here are not correct anymore. The only one still OK is the one from Frank Forte, as he talks about PHP7.\nOn the other side, rather than trying to catch error with a try/catch you can use a trick: use include.\nHere 3 pieces of code:File: tst1.phpRunning this in PHP7 will show nothingNow, try this:File: tst2.phpFile: tst3.phpNow run tst2 which set the error reporting then include tst3. You will see:Parse error: syntax error, unexpected end of file, expecting variable (T_VARIABLE) or ${ (T_DOLLAR_OPEN_CURLY_BRACES) or {$ (T_CURLY_OPEN) in tst3.php on line 4Just write:The best/easy/fast solution that you can use if it\'s a quick debugging, is to surround your code with catching exceptions. That\'s what I\'m doing when I want to check something fast on production.I Hope this helps.That\'s what I learnt. In PHP.INI fileThis code on top should work error_reporting(E_ALL);However try to edit the code on phone in fileerror_reporting =onYou can add your own custom error handler, which can provide extra debug info. Furthermore you can set it up to send you via email.
