The hard drive on my laptop just crashed and I lost all the source code for an app that I have been working on for the past two months.\nAll I have is the APK file that is stored in my email from when I sent it to a friend. Is there any way to extract my source code from this APK file?Simple way: use online tool http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk, upload apk and get source code.Procedure for decoding .apk files, step-by-step method:Make a new folder and copy over the .apk file that you want to decode.Now rename the extension of this .apk file to .zip (e.g. rename from filename.apk to filename.zip) and save it. Now you can access the classes.dex files, etc. At this stage you are able to see drawables but not xml and java files, so continue.Now extract this .zip file in the same folder (or NEW FOLDER).Download dex2jar and extract it to the same folder (or NEW FOLDER).Move the classes.dex file into the dex2jar folder.Now open command prompt and change directory to that folder (or NEW FOLDER). Then write d2j-dex2jar classes.dex (for mac terminal or ubuntu write ./d2j-dex2jar.sh classes.dex) and press enter. You now have the classes.dex.dex2jar file in the same folder.Download java decompiler, double click on jd-gui, click on open file, and open classes.dex.dex2jar file from that folder: now you get class files.Save all of these class files (In jd-gui, click File -> Save All Sources) by src name. At this stage you get the java source but the .xml files are still unreadable, so continue.Now open another new folderPut in the .apk file which you want to decodeDownload the latest version of apktool AND apktool install window (both can be downloaded from the same link) and place them in the same folderOpen a command windowNow run command like apktool if framework-res.apk and nextapktool d myApp.apk  (where myApp.apk denotes the filename that you want to decode)now you get a file folder in that folder and can easily read the apk\'s xml files. It\'s not any step just copy contents of both folder(in this case both new folder)to the single one and enjoy the source code...This is an alternative description - just in case someone got stuck with the description above. Follow the steps:\nIntermediate result: resource files, AndroidManifest.xml\nIntermediate result: classes.dex\nIntermediate result: classes_dex2jar.jar\nResult: source code Note: it is not allowed to decompile third party packages; this guide is intended to recover personal source code from an APK file only; finally, the resulting code will most likely be obfuscated While you may be able to decompile your APK file, you will likely hit one big issue: it\'s not going to return the code you wrote. It is instead going to return whatever the compiler inlined, with variables given random names, as well as functions given random names. It could take significantly more time to try to decompile and restore it into the code you had, than it will be to start over.Sadly, things like this have killed many projects.\nFor the future, I highly recommend learning a Version Control System, like CVS, SVN and git etc.and how to back it up.There is also a new application on the Play Store with which it is possible to decompile an apk (system applications too) and view the source code right on your smartphone. It saves the files to your SD card so you can view it on your computer too. It does not require root or something else. Just install and have fun. I think this is the easiest way to decompile an app.apktool is the best thing you can try. I have saved some xml with it, but honestly I don\'t know how it will work with the .java code.I would recommend you to have a code repository even if your are the only coder. I\'ve been using Project Locker for my own projects. It gives you free svn and git repos.These two articles describe how to combine the use of apktool and dex2jar to take an APK file and create an Eclipse project that can build and run it.http://blog.inyourbits.com/2012/11/extending-existing-android-applications.htmlhttp://blog.inyourbits.com/2012/12/extending-existing-android-applications.htmlBasically you:apktool will work. You don\'t even need to know the keystore to extract the source code (which is a bit scary). The main downside is that the source is presented in Smali format instead of Java. Other files such as the icon and main.xml come through perfectly fine though and it may be worth your time to at least recover those. Ultimately, you will most likely need to re-write your Java code from scratch.You can find apktool here. Simply just download apktool and the appropriate helper (for Windows, Linux, or Mac OS). I recommend using a tool such as 7-zip to unpack them.I\'ll show you other way to decompile the .apk files.You can follow the first 2 steps from "prankul garg". So you have another opportunities:Step 3\':Download the "JD-GUI", thats easy to found this one.\nOpen your .jar file in "jd-gui.exe". (File > Open file > \'found your .jar file\'). After this procedure, you can save all resources in a .zip file.So, 1st - You have to rename the .apk file to .zip2nd - You have to decode .dex file (if you want, decode the .apk file to dex2jar, that\'s possible)3rd - You have to decode .jar file with JD-GUIMay be the easy one to see the source:In Android studio 2.3, Build -> Analyze APK -> Select the apk that you want to decompile.\nYou will see it\'s source code.Linf for reference:\nhttps://medium.com/google-developers/making-the-most-of-the-apk-analyzer-c066cb871ea2Apktool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after making some modifications. It makes possible to debug smali code step by step. Also it makes working with an app easier because of project-like file structure and automation of some repetitive tasks like building apk, etc.http://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/apktool is THE way to go.\nOnline apktool service exists as well: http://www.javadecompilers.com/apktoolSome limitations, obviously, exist due to the service \xe2\x80\x98online nature\xe2\x80\x99: you may extract and research assets and the manifest file, but it is impossible to recompile the application at the moment.Still, this is a no-hassle way to \'open\' the android application.There are a few ways to do this:Use the "Profile or Debug APK" feature in Android Studio 3.0.It allows you to open and explore APKs in Android Studio. Classes are decompiled into smali. Resources are not extracted and things like "Go to Definition", "Find All References" and debugging don\'t work without the source code (android studio 3.0 canary 9). Some additional smali features might work with smalidea.Use jadx.Jadx decompiles the code in a given APK to java source files.Use apktool.Apktool is a command line tool which extracts resources and decompiles code into smali for a given apk. You can recompile using apktool also. Here\'s an example of it in action:Below ONLINE tool: http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk it do ALL by one click: decompiled .java files + resources + xml (in one .zip file) with very good decompiler (jadx return java code in places/functions  where other compiles return comments inside function like "unable to decompile" or some android assembler/machine code)This site https://www.apkdecompilers.com/ did it automatically.I tried the site mentioned in the accepted answer first but that didn\'t work for me.
