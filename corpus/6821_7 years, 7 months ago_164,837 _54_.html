I am displaying in a group tableview contents parsed from XML. I want to disable the click event on it (I should not be able to click it at all) The table contains two groups. I want to disable selection for the first group only but not the second group. Clicking the first row of second group navigates to my tube player view. How can I make just specific groups or rows selectable?Thanks.You just have to put this code into cellForRowAtIndexPathTo disable the cell\'s selection property:(While tapping the cell).To enable being able to select (tap) thecell:(tapping the cell).Note that a cell with selectionStyle = UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone will still cause the UI to call didSelectRowAtIndexPath when touched by the user. To avoid this, do as suggested below and set.instead. Also note you may want to set cell.textLabel.enabled = false to grey out the item.If you want to make a row (or subset of rows) non-selectable, implement the UITableViewDelegate method -tableView:willSelectRowAtIndexPath: (also mentioned by TechZen). If the indexPath should be not be selectable, return nil, otherwise return the indexPath.  To get the default selection behavior, you just return the indexPath passed to your delegate method, but you can also alter the row selection by returning a different indexPath.example:Starting in iOS 6, you can use If you return NO, it disables both the selection highlighting and the storyboard triggered segues connected to that cell.The method is called when a touch comes down on a row. Returning NO to that message halts the selection process and does not cause the currently selected row to lose its selected look while the touch is down.UITableViewDelegate Protocol ReferenceNone from the answers above really addresses the issue correctly. The reason is that we want to disable selection of the cell but not necessarily of subviews inside the cell.In my case I was presenting a UISwitch in the middle of the row and I wanted to disable selection for the rest of the row (which is empty) but not for the switch! The proper way of doing that is hence in the methodwhere a statement of the formdisables selection for the specific cell while at the same time allows the user to manipulate the switch and hence use the appropriate selector. This is not true if somebody disables user interaction through the method which merely prepares the cell and does not allow interaction with the UISwitch.Moreover, using the methodin order to deselect the cell with a statement of the form still shows the row being selected while the user presses on the original contentView of the cell.Just my two cents. I am pretty sure many will find this useful.You trap selections with these data source methods.In these methods, you check if the selected row is one you want to be selectable. If it is, take an action, if not, do nothing. Unfortunately, you can\'t turn off selection for just one section. It\'s the whole table or nothing. You can however set the table cells selectionStyle property to UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone. I believe that will make the selection invisible. Combined with the above methods that should make the cells look completely inert from the user\'s perspective. If you have a table in which only some of the rows are selectable it is important that the cells of the selectable rows be visually distinct from the non-selectable rows. The chevron accessory button is the default way to do this. However you do it, you don\'t want your users trying to select rows and thinking the app has malfed because the row doesn\'t do anything. You need to do something like the following to disable cell selection within the cellForRowAtIndexPath method:To show the cell grayed out, put the following within the tableView:WillDisplayCell:forRowAtIndexPath method:One method allows you to control the interactivity, the other allows you to control the UI appearance.For Swift 2.0 for example:To stop just some cells being selected use:As well as preventing selection, this also stops tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath: being called for the cells that have it set.You can use the tableView:willDisplayCell method to do all the kinds of customization to a tableViewCell.In this above code, the user can only select the first row in the second section of the tableView. The rest all rows can\'t be selected. Thanks!~For swift:My solution based on data model:SIMPLE Just use cell.userInteractionEnabled = YES; to the cell if it can navigate and cell.userInteractionEnabled = NO; otherwiseI like Brian Chapados answer above.  However, this means that you may have logic duplicated in both cellForRowAtIndexPath and then in willSelectRowAtIndexPath which can easily get out of sync.  Instead of duplicating the logic, just check the selectionStyle:I found this handy as it works with both static and dynamic tables. I only set the disclosure indicator on those cells I want to allow selection.on Xcode 7 without coding you can simply do the following: In the outline view, select Table View Cell.\n(The cell is nested under Table View Controller Scene > Table View Controller > Table View. You may have to disclose those objects to see the table view cell)In the Attributes inspector, find the field labeled Selection and select None.\natribute inspector\nWith this option, the cell won\xe2\x80\x99t get a visual highlight when a user taps it.Use this to make the cell look like it is disabled and non-selectable:Important: note that this is only a styling property, and does not actually disable the cell. In order to do that, you have to check for selectionStylein your didSelectRowAtIndexPath: delegate implementation:Implement just the method tableView:willSelectRowAtIndexPath:\nin the data source for your table. If you want the row at the path to highlight, return the given indexPath. If you do not, return nil.Example from my app:The nice thing about this is that shouldPerformSegueWithIdentifier:sender: will not be called if the above method returns nil, although I repeat the test above just for completeness.For Xcode 6.3:For me, the following worked fine:for swift 3.0 you can use below code to disable user interaction to UITableView cell
