I have a Date object. How do I render the title portion of the following snippet?I have the "relative time in words" portion from another library.I\'ve tried the following:But that gives me:There is already a function called toISOString(): If, somehow, you\'re on a browser that doesn\'t support it, I\'ve got you covered:See the last example on page https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference:Global_Objects:Date:Almost every to-ISO method on the web drops the timezone information by applying a convert to "Z"ulu time (UTC) before outputting the string. Browser\'s native .toISOString() also drops timezone information.This discards valuable information, as the server, or recipient, can always convert a full ISO date to Zulu time or whichever timezone it requires, while still getting the timezone information of the sender.The best solution I\'ve come across is to use the Moment.js javascript library and use the following code:To get the current ISO time with timezone information and millisecondsTo get the ISO time of a native JavaScript Date object with timezone information but without millisecondsThis can be combined with Date.js to get functions like Date.today() whose result can then be passed to moment.A date string formatted like this is JSON compilant, and lends itself well to get stored into a database. Python and C# seem to like it.The question asked was ISO format with reduced precision. Voila:Assuming the trailing Z is wanted, otherwise just omit.If you don\'t need to support IE7, the following is a great, concise hack:Shortest, but not supported by Internet Explorer 8 and earlier:There is a \'+\' missing after the \'T\'should do it.For the leading zeros you could use this from here:Using it like this:I typically don\'t want to display a UTC date since customers don\'t like doing the conversion in their head. To display a local ISO date, I use the function:The function above omits time zone offset information (except if local time happens to be UTC), so I use the function below to show the local offset in a single location. You can also append its output to results from the above function if you wish to show the offset in each and every time:toLocalIsoString uses pad. If needed, it works like nearly any pad function, but for the sake of completeness this is what I use:The problem with toISOString is that it gives datetime only as "Z". ISO-8601 also defines datetime with timezone difference in hours and minutes, in the forms like 2016-07-16T19:20:30+5:30 (when timezone is ahead UTC) and 2016-07-16T19:20:30-01:00 (when timezone is behind UTC).I don\'t think it is a good idea to use another plugin, moment.js for such a small task, especially when you can get it with a few lines of code.Once you have the timezone offset in hours and minutes, you can append to a datetime string.I wrote a blog post on it : http://usefulangle.com/post/30/javascript-get-date-time-with-offset-hours-minutesI would just use this small extension to Date - http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-formatI was able to get below output with very less code.Output:I found the basics on Stack Overflow somewhere (I believe it was part of some other Stack Exchange code golfing), and I improved it so it works on Internet Explorer 10 or earlier as well. It\'s ugly, but it gets the job done.
