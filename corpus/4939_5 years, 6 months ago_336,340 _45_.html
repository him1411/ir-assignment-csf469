In my Android application, I am using spinner, and I have loaded data from the SQLite database into the spinner, and it\'s working properly. Here is the code for that.Now I want to change the text color and text size of spinner data. I have used following XML lines to my spinner tag on my XML file, but it is not working.How can I change the text color and text size of my spinner?Make a custom XML file for your spinner item.spinner_item.xml:Give your customized color and size to text in this file.Now use this file to show your spinner items like:You don\'t need to set the drop down resource. It will take spinner_item.xml only to show your items in spinner.Simple and crisp...:If all the spinners may have the same text color for their TextView items, another approach is to use a custom style for spinner dropdown items:In res/values/styles.xml:And define your custom color in res/values/colors.xml:Here is a link that can help you to change the color of the Spinner:Click hereYou need to create your own layout file with a custom definition for the spinner item spinner_item.xml:If you want to customize the dropdown list items, you will need to create a new layout file. spinner_dropdown_item.xml:And finally another change in the declaration of the spinner:That\'s it.To prevent lagging, you need to not only set the text properties in the onItemSelected listener, but also in the Activity\'s onCreate method (but it\'s a little tricky).Specifically, you need to put this in onCreate after setting the adapter:And then put this in onItemSelected:Here is a full example:For more details, see my question.Rather than making a custom layout to get a small size and if you want to use Android\'s internal small size LAYOUT for the spinner, you should use:"android.R.layout.simple_gallery_item" instead of "android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item".It can reduce the size of spinner\'s layout. It\'s just a simple trick.If you want to reduce the size of a drop down list use this:Simplest: Works for meThe easiest way to re-use/change the android.R.layout resources is just go the definition. In Android Studio, do Ctrl + B on android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item.xml.It will take you to the resource file. Just copy the resource file and add a new layout in your Package.R.layout folder and change the textColor of textview as you like and then just call it in adapter like this:just use this:First we have to create the simple xml resource file for the textview like as below:    and save it. after set on your adapterlist.If you want the text color to change in the selected item only, then this can be a possible workaround. It worked for me and should work for you as well.Another variation of Ashraf\'s solution would be to make sure you\'re taking into account screen sizes.  You\'ll need to get the spinner in onCreate and set the listener after you set the adapter:Then you can start changing the text size of the view that\'s showing before the spinner is clicked:All you need to do is create layout specific folders like this:values-sw360dpvalues-sw600dpvalues-sw800dpan then add an xml file named "bool.xml" into each of those folders:I have done this as following.I have use getDropDownView() and getView() methods.Use getDropDownView() for opened Spinner.And Use getView() for closed Spinner.For those who want to change DrowDownIcon color\nyou can use like this
