I know about joins in SQL Server.For example. there is two tables Table1, Table2. There table structure are following.Table1 Data as follows:Table2 Data as follows:If I execute both below mentioned SQL statements, both outputs will be the samePlease explain the difference between left and right join in above sql statements.andare indeed completely interchangeable. Try however Table2 left join Table1 (or its identical pair, Table1 right join Table2) to see a difference. This query should give you more rows, since Table2 contains a row with an id which is not present in Table1.Codeproject has this image which explains the simple basics of SQL joins, taken from: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/Visual_SQL_Joins.aspx\nTable from which you are taking data is \'LEFT\'.\nTable you are joining is \'RIGHT\'.\nLEFT JOIN: Take all items from left table AND (only) matching items from right table.\nRIGHT JOIN: Take all items from right table AND (only) matching items from left table.\nSo:  gives:  but:  gives:  you were right joining table with less rows on table with more rows\nAND\nagain, left joining table with less rows on table with more rows\nTry:  The table in the from in this example tableA, is on the left side of relation.So if you want to take all rows from the left table (tableA), even if there are no matches in the right table (tableB), you\'ll use the "left join".And if you want to take all rows from the right table (tableB), even if there are no matches in the left table (tableA), you will use the right join.Thus, the following query is equivalent to that used above.Your two statements are equivalent.Most people only use LEFT JOIN since it seems more intuitive, and it\'s universal syntax - I don\'t think all RDBMS support RIGHT JOIN.You seem to be asking, "If I can rewrite a RIGHT OUTER JOIN using LEFT OUTER JOIN syntax then why have a RIGHT OUTER JOIN syntax at all?" I think the answer to this question is, because the designers of the language didn\'t want to place such a restriction on users (and I think they would have been criticized if they did), which would force users to change the order of tables in the FROM clause in some circumstances when merely changing the join type.I feel we may require "AND" condition in where clause of last figure of "Outer Excluding JOIN" so that we get the desired result of A Union B Minus A Interaction B.\nI feel query needs to be updated to SELECT \nFROM Table_A A\nFULL OUTER JOIN Table_B B\nON A.Key = B.Key\nWHERE A.Key IS NULL AND B.Key IS NULLIf we use OR , then we will get all the results of A Union BI ran this on sql server and it fetched the same results B LEFT JOIN A = A RIGHT JOIN B. Only Reason I could understand behind it "Ease of use and Convenience".
