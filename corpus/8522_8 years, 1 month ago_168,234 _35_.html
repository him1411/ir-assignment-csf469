I have a string which contains a mixture of upper and lower case characters, for example "a Simple string" . What I want to do is to convert first character of each word ( I can assume that words are separated by spaces) into upper case. So I want the result as "A Simple String". Is there any easy way to do this? I don\'t want to split the string and do the conversion (that will be my last resort). Also, it is guaranteed that the strings are in English.MSDN : TextInfo.ToTitleCase Try this:As has already been pointed out, using TextInfo.ToTitleCase might not give you the exact results you want. If you need more control over the output, you could do something like this:And then use it like so:Yet another variation. Based on several tips here I\'ve reduced it to this extension method, which works great for my purposes:Personally I tried the TextInfo.ToTitleCase method, but, I don\xc2\xb4t understand why it doesn\xc2\xb4t work when all chars are upper-cased.Though I like the util function provided by Winston Smith, let me provide the function I\'m currently using:Playing with some tests strings:Giving output:Recently I found the Better Solution. If your text Contains every letter in uppercase then TextInfo will not convert it to the Proper Case so, then, we can fix that by using the Lowercase function inside like ::And, now this will convert everything comes in to Propercase.Here\'s the solution for that problem...If someone is interested for the solution for Compact Framework :Use ToLower() first, than CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ToTitleCase on the result to get the correct output.I needed a way to deal with all caps words, and I liked Ricky AH\'s solution, but I took it a step further to implement it as an extension method. This avoids the step of having to create your array of chars then call ToArray on it explicitly every time - so you can just call it on the string, like so:usage:code:Its better to understand by trying your own code...Read more http://www.stupidcodes.com/2014/04/convert-string-to-uppercase-proper-case.html 1) Convert a String to Uppercase2) Convert a String to Lowercase3) Convert a String to TitleCaseHere is an implementation, character by character. Should work with "(One Two Three)"Try this:\nCall this method in the TextChanged event of the TextBox.I used the above references and complete solution is:-//Need result like "Infoa2z Means All Information"\n//We need to convert the string in lowercase also, otherwise it is not working properly. http://www.infoa2z.com/asp.net/change-string-to-proper-case-in-an-asp.net-using-c#You can directly change text or string to proper using this simple method, after checking for null or empty string values in order to eliminate errors:This is what I use and it works for most cases unless the user decides to override it by pressing shift or caps lock. Like on Android and iOS keyboards.For the ones who are looking to do it automatically on keypress I did it with following code in vb.net on a custom textboxcontrol - you can obviously also do it with a normal textbox - but I like the possibility to add recurring code for specific controls via custom controls it suits the concept of OOP.I know this an old question but I was searching for the same thing for C and I figured it out so I figured I\'d post it if someone else is searching for a way in C:
