players will either be empty or a comma separated list (or a single value). What is the easiest way to check if it\'s empty? I\'m assuming I can do so as soon as I fetch the $gameresult array into $gamerow? In this case it would probably be more efficient to skip exploding the $playerlist if it\'s empty, but for the sake of argument, how would I check if an array is empty as well?If you just need to check if there are ANY elements in the arrayIf you need to clean out empty values before checking (generally done to prevent explodeing weird strings):An empty array is falsey in PHP, so you don\'t even need to use empty() as others have suggested.PHP\'s empty() determines if a variable doesn\'t exist or has a falsey value (like array(), 0, null, false, etc). In most cases you just want to check !$emptyVar. Use empty($emptyVar) if the variable might not have been set AND you don\'t wont to trigger an E_NOTICE; IMO this is generally a bad idea.Some decent answers, but just thought I\'d expand a bit to explain more clearly when PHP determines if an array is empty.  Main Notes:  An array with a key (or keys) will be determined as NOT empty by PHP.  As array values need keys to exist, having values or not in an array doesn\'t determine if it\'s empty, only if there are no keys (AND therefore no values).  So checking an array with empty() doesn\'t simply tell you if you have values or not, it tells you if the array is empty, and keys are part of an array.  So consider how you are producing your array before deciding which checking method to use.\nEG An array will have keys when a user submits your HTML form when each form field has an array name (ie name="array[]").\nA non empty array will be produced for each field as there will be auto incremented key values for each form field\'s array.  Take these arrays for example:  If you echo out the array keys and values for the above arrays, you get the following:ARRAY ONE:\n  [UserKeyA] => [UserValueA]\n  [UserKeyB] => [UserValueB]  ARRAY TWO:\n  [0] => [UserValue01]\n  [1] => [UserValue02]  ARRAY THREE:\n  [0] => []\n  [1] => []  And testing the above arrays with empty() returns the following results:ARRAY ONE:\n  $ArrayOne is not empty  ARRAY TWO:\n  $ArrayTwo is not empty  ARRAY THREE:\n  $ArrayThree is not emptyAn array will always be empty when you assign an array but don\'t use it thereafter, such as:This will be empty, ie PHP will return TRUE when using if empty() on the above.  So if your array has keys - either by eg a form\'s input names or if you assign them manually (ie create an array with database column names as the keys but no values/data from the database), then the array will NOT be empty().  In this case, you can loop the array in a foreach, testing if each key has a value. This is a good method if you need to run through the array anyway, perhaps checking the keys or sanitising data.  However it is not the best method if you simply need to know "if values exist" returns TRUE or FALSE.\nThere are various methods to determine if an array has any values when it\'s know it will have keys. A function or class might be the best approach, but as always it depends on your environment and exact requirements, as well as other things such as what you currently do with the array (if anything).Here\'s an approach which uses very little code to check if an array has values:Using array_filter():\nIterates over each value in the array passing them to the callback function. If the callback function returns true, the current value from array is returned into the result array. Array keys are preserved.Running array_filter() on all three example arrays (created in the first code block in this answer) results in the following:ARRAY ONE:\n  $arrayone is not empty  ARRAY TWO:\n  $arraytwo is not empty  ARRAY THREE:\n  $arraythree is empty  So when there are no values, whether there are keys or not, using array_filter() to create a new array and then check if the new array is empty shows if there were any values in the original array.\nIt is not ideal and a bit messy, but if you have a huge array and don\'t need to loop through it for any other reason, then this is the simplest in terms of code needed.  I\'m not experienced in checking overheads, but it would be good to know the differences between using array_filter() and foreach checking if a value is found.Obviously benchmark would need to be on various parameters, on small and large arrays and when there are values and not etc. count($gamerow[\'players\']) will be 0.If you want to ascertain whether the variable you are testing is actually explicitly an empty array, you could use something like this:is_arrayI use this codeBut note that if the array has a large number of keys, this code will spend much time counting them, as compared to the other answers here.if you are to check the array content you may use:see here:\n    http://codepad.org/EORE4k7vyou can use array_filters which works great for all situationsHow about:The above solutions did not work for me. Rather I used more reliable way (it may have move overhead):
