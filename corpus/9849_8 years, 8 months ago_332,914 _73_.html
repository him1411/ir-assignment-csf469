What is a stored procedure? How do they work? What is the make-up of a stored procedure (things each must have to be a stored procedure)?Stored procedures are a batch of SQL statements that can be executed in a couple of ways. Most major DBMs support stored procedures; however, not all do. You will need to verify with your particular DBMS help documentation for specifics. As I am most familiar with SQL Server I will use that as my samples. To create a stored procedure the syntax is fairly simple:So for example:A benefit of stored procedures is that you can centralize data access logic into a single place that is then easy for DBA\'s to optimize. Stored procedures also have a security benefit in that you can grant execute rights to a stored procedure but the user will not need to have read/write permissions on the underlying tables. This is a good first step against SQL injection.Stored procedures do come with downsides, basically the maintenance associated with your basic CRUD operation. Let\'s say for each table you have an Insert, Update, Delete and at least one select based on the primary key, that means each table will have 4 procedures. Now take a decent size database of 400 tables, and you have 1600 procedures! And that\'s assuming you don\'t have duplicates which you probably will.This is where using an ORM or some other method to auto generate your basic CRUD operations has a ton of merit. A stored procedure is a set of precompiled SQL statements that are used to perform a special task.Example: If I have an Employee tableFirst I am retrieving the Employee table:To run the procedure on SQL Server:Then second, I am inserting the value into the Employee TableTo run the parametrized procedure on SQL Server:Example: @Name Varchar(30)In the Employee table the Name column\'s size must be varchar(30).A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that has been created and stored in the database. A stored procedure will accept input parameters so that a single procedure can be used over the network by several clients using different input data. A stored procedures will reduce network traffic and increase the performance. If we modify a stored procedure all the clients will get the updated stored procedure.Sample of creating a stored procedureAdvantages of using stored proceduresA stored procedure allows modular programming.You can create the procedure once, store it in the database, and call it any number of times in your program.A stored procedure allows faster execution.If the operation requires a large amount of SQL code that is performed repetitively, stored procedures can be faster. They are parsed and optimized when they are first executed, and a compiled version of the stored procedure remains in a memory cache for later use. This means the stored procedure does not need to be reparsed and reoptimized with each use, resulting in much faster execution times.A stored procedure can reduce network traffic.An operation requiring hundreds of lines of Transact-SQL code can be performed through a single statement that executes the code in a procedure, rather than by sending hundreds of lines of code over the network.Stored procedures provide better security to your dataUsers can be granted permission to execute a stored procedure even if they do not have permission to execute the procedure\'s statements directly.In SQL Server we have different types of stored procedures:System-stored procedures are stored in the master database and these start with a sp_ prefix. These procedures can be used to perform a variety of tasks to support SQL Server functions for external application calls in the system tablesExample: sp_helptext [StoredProcedure_Name]User-defined stored procedures are usually stored in a user database and are typically designed to complete the tasks in the user database. While coding these procedures don\xe2\x80\x99t use the sp_ prefix because if we use the sp_ prefix first, it will check the master database, and then it comes to user defined database.Extended stored procedures are the procedures that call functions from DLL files. Nowadays, extended stored procedures are depreciated for the reason it would be better to avoid using extended stored procedures.Generally, a stored procedure is a "SQL Function."  They have:This is a T-SQL focused example. Stored procedures can execute most SQL statements, return scalar and table-based values, and are considered to be more secure because they prevent SQL injection attacks.  Think of a situation like this,NOTE:A stored procedure is mainly used to perform certain tasks on a database. For exampleA stored procedure is nothing but a group of SQL statements compiled into a single execution plan.Example: creating a stored procedureAlter or modify a stored procedure:Drop or delete a stored procedure:A stored procedure is used to retrieve data, modify data, and delete data in database table. You don\'t need to write a whole SQL command each time you want to insert, update or delete data in an SQL database.A stored procedure is a named collection of SQL statements and procedural logic i.e, compiled, verified and stored in the server database. A stored procedure is typically treated like other database objects and controlled through server security mechanism.A stored procedure is a precompiled set of one or more SQL statements which perform some specific task.A stored procedure should be executed stand alone using EXECA stored procedure can return multiple parametersA stored procedure can be used to implement transactIn a DBMS, a stored procedure is a set of SQL statements with an assigned name that\'s stored in the database in compiled form so that it can be shared by a number of programs.The use of a stored procedure can be helpful in Providing a controlled access to data (end users can only enter or change data, but can\'t write procedures)Ensuring data integrity (data would be entered in a consistent manner) andImproves productivity (the statements of a stored procedure need to be written only once)"What is a stored procedure" is already answered in other posts here. What I will post is one less known way of using stored procedure. It is grouping stored procedures or numbering stored procedures.Syntax Reference; number as per thisAn optional integer that is used to group procedures of the same name. These grouped procedures can be dropped together by using one DROP PROCEDURE statementExampleUse ResultAnother AttemptResultMsg 2730, Level 11, State 1, Procedure SecondTest, Line 1 [Batch Start Line 3]\n  Cannot create procedure \'SecondTest\' with a group number of 2 because a procedure with the same name and a group number of 1 does not currently exist in the database.\n  Must execute CREATE PROCEDURE \'SecondTest\';1 first.References:CAUTIONfor simple,Stored Procedure are Stored Programs, A program/function stored into database.Each stored program contains a body that consists of an SQL statement. This statement may be a compound statement made up of several statements separated by semicolon (;) characters.Stored procedures in SQL Server can accept input parameters and return multiple values of output parameters; in SQL Server, stored procedures program statements to perform operations in the database and return a status value to a calling procedure or batch.The benefits of using stored procedures in SQL ServerThey allow modular programming.\nThey allow faster execution.\nThey can reduce network traffic.\nThey can be used as a security mechanism.Here is an example of a stored procedure that takes a parameter, executes a query and return a result.  Specifically, the stored procedure accepts the BusinessEntityID as a parameter and uses this to match the primary key of the HumanResources.Employee table to return the requested employee.I learned this from essential.com...it is very useful.
