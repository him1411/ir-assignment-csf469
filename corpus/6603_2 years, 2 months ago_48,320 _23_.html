I am working on a typescript project in Visual Studio code and would like to hide the .js.map (and maybe even the .js) files from appearing in the file explorer.  Is it possible to display only the .ts files in the file explorer?In your settings (either user or workspace) there is a setting that you can tweak to hide anything you\'d like:So you can add in the following to hide .js and .js.map filesAs this other answer explains, most people probably only want to hide .js files when there is a matching .ts file.So instead of doing:you might want to do:I found this, If you have standard JS files then these will be hidden too which may not always be what you want. Perhaps this is better as it only hides JS files that match TS files...I really don\'t know how this is implemented but for hiding .js files works:For hiding .js.map files works:   When you are working with TypeScript, you often don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see generated JavaScript files in the explorer or in search results. VS Code offers filtering capabilities with a files.exclude setting (File > Preferences > Workspace Settings) and you can easily create an expression to hide those derived files:Similarly hide generated .map files by:So you will have a configuration like in:settings.jsonLink: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_hiding-derived-javascript-filesJohn Papa Twitter LINK says use the following:Add these settings to your settings.json in your .vscode folderIf the settings.json is not available click on File ---> Preferences --> Workspace Settings.Maybe it\'s better to hide .map and .js files when they match their corresponding .ts file.\nYou can do that by copying the following lines in VS User Settings (Preferences > User Settings):From the official doc: to exclude JavaScript files generated from both .ts and .tsx source\n  files, use this expression:This is a bit of a trick. The search glob pattern is used as a key.\n  The settings above use two different glob patterns to provide two\n  unique keys but the search will still match the same files.In VS Code go to Code (or File for Windows users) > Preferences > Workspace Settings and add this code snippet:
