I\'ve recently switched to Google Maps API V3. I\'m working of a simple example which plots markers from an array, however I do not know how to center and zoom automatically with respect to the markers. I\'ve searched the net high and low, including Google\'s own documentation, but have not found a clear answer. I know I could simply take an average of the co-ordinates, but how would I set the zoom accordingly?Yes, simply declare your new bounds object.Then for each marker, extend your bounds object:API: google.maps.LatLngBoundsGot everything sorted - see the last few lines for code - (bounds.extend(myLatLng); map.fitBounds(bounds);)My suggestion for google maps api v3 would be(don\'t think it can be done more effeciently):In the result u will fit all points in bounds in your map window.Example works perfectly and u freely can check it here www.zemelapis.ltThe answers are perfect for adjust map boundaries for markers but if you like to expand Google Maps boundaries for shapes like polygons and circles, you can use following codes:For CirclesFor PolygonsFor RectanglesFor PolylinesThe setCenter() method is still applicable for latest version of Maps API for Flash where fitBounds() does not exist.Use below one,map.setCenter(bounds.getCenter(), map.getBoundsZoomLevel(bounds));
