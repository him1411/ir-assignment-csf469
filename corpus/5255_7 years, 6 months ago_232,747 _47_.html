I\'m showing an input box using AlertDialog. The EditText inside the dialog itself is automatically focused when I call AlertDialog.show(), but the soft keyboard is not automatically shown.How do I make the soft keyboard automatically show when the dialog is shown? (and there is no physical/hardware keyboard). Similar to how when I press the Search button to invoke the global search, the soft keyboard is automatically shown.You can create a focus listener on the EditText on the AlertDialog, then get the AlertDialog\'s Window. From there you can make the soft keyboard show by calling setSoftInputMode.For showing keyboard use:For hiding keyboard use:You can request a soft keyboard right after creating the dialog (test on  SDK - r20)I had the same problem and solved it with the following code. I\'m not sure how it will behave on a phone with hardware keyboard.I found this example http://android-codes-examples.blogspot.com/2011/11/show-or-hide-soft-keyboard-on-opening.html. Add the following code just before alert.show().orSnippets of code from other answers work, but it is not always obvious where to place them in the code, especially if you are using an AlertDialog.Builder and followed the official dialog tutorial because it doesn\'t use final AlertDialog ... or alertDialog.show().Is preferable toBecause SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_VISIBLE will hide the keyboard if the focus switches away from the EditText, where SHOW_FORCED will keep the keyboard displayed until it is explicitly dismissed, even if the user returns to the homescreen or displays the recent apps.Below is working code for an AlertDialog created using a custom layout with an EditText defined in XML.  It also sets the keyboard to have a "go" key and allows it to trigger the positive button.alert_dialog.xml:AlertDialog.java:Let me point some additional info to the solution of yuku, because I found it hard to get this working! How do I get the AlertDialog object from my AlertDialog.Builder? Well, it\'s the result of my alert.show() execution:Take a look at this discussion which handles manually hiding and showing the IME. However, my feeling is that if a focused EditText is not bringing the IME up it is because you are calling AlertDialog.show() in your OnCreate() or some other method which is evoked before the screen is actually presented. Moving it to OnPostResume() should fix it in that case I believe.Well, this is a pretty old post, still there is something to add. These are 2 simple methods that help me to keep keyboard under control and they work just perfect:Show keyboardHide keyboardYes you can do with setOnFocusChangeListener it  will help you.If anyone is getting:Cannot make a static reference to the non-static method getSystemService(String) from the type ActivityTry adding context to getSystemService call.SoThe original question concerns Dialogs and my EditText is on a regular view. Anyhow, I suspect this should work for most of you too. So here\'s what works for me (the above suggested highest rated method did nothing for me). Here\'s a custom EditView that does this (subclassing is not necessary, but I found it convenient for my purposes as I wanted to also grab the focus when the view becomes visible).This is actually largely the same as the tidbecks answer. I actually didn\'t notice his answer at all as it had zero up votes. Then I was about to just comment his post, but it would have been too long, so I ended doing this post anyways. tidbeck points out that he\'s unsure how it works with devices having keyboards. I can confirm that the behaviour seems to be exactly the same in either case. That being such that on portrait mode the software keyboard gets popped up and on landscape it doesn\'t. Having the physical keyboard slid out or not makes no difference on my phone.Because, I personally found the behaviour a bit awkward I opted for using: InputMethodManager.SHOW_FORCED. This works as I wanted it to work. The keyboard becomes visible regardless of the orientation, however, at least on my device it doesn\'t pop up if the hardware keyboard has been slid out.The problem seems to be that since the place where you enter text is hidden initially (or nested or something), AlertDialog is automatically setting the flag WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM or WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE so that things don\'t trigger a soft input to show up.The way that to fix this is to add the following:try and use:To show keyboard, for me, I had to do the followingAndroid TextField : set focus + soft input programmaticallyEssentially the solution is the followingWhere ShowKeyboard isAfter a successful input, I also make sure I hide the keyboardThis is good sample for you :Why this answer - Because above solution will show your keyboard but it will not vanish if you click anywhere other that EditText. So you need to do something to make the keybaord disappear when EditText loses focus.You can achieve this by doing the following steps:Make the parent view(content view of your activity) clickable and focusable by adding the following attributesImplement a hideKeyboard() methodLastly, set the onFocusChangeListener of your edittext.This is bit tricky. I did in this way and it worked.1.At first call to hide the soft Input from the window. This will hide the soft input if the soft keyboard is visible or do nothing if it is not.2.Show your dialog3.Then simply call to toggle soft input.code:
