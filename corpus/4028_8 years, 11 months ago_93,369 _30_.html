When used like this:what\'s the difference between import static com.showboy.Myclass and import com.showboy.Myclass?See DocumentationThe static import declaration is\n  analogous to the normal import\n  declaration. Where the normal import\n  declaration imports classes from\n  packages, allowing them to be used\n  without package qualification, the\n  static import declaration imports\n  static members from classes, allowing\n  them to be used without class\n  qualification.So when should you use static import?\n  Very sparingly! Only use it when you\'d\n  otherwise be tempted to declare local\n  copies of constants, or to abuse\n  inheritance (the Constant Interface\n  Antipattern). In other words, use it\n  when you require frequent access to\n  static members from one or two\n  classes. If you overuse the static\n  import feature, it can make your\n  program unreadable and unmaintainable,\n  polluting its namespace with all the\n  static members you import. Readers of\n  your code (including you, a few months\n  after you wrote it) will not know\n  which class a static member comes\n  from. Importing all of the static\n  members from a class can be\n  particularly harmful to readability;\n  if you need only one or two members,\n  import them individually. Used\n  appropriately, static import can make\n  your program more readable, by\n  removing the boilerplate of repetition\n  of class names.There is no difference between those two imports you state.  You can, however, use the static import to allow unqualified access to static members of other classes.  Where I used to have to do this:I can do this:Static import is used to import static fields / method of a class instead of:You can write :It is useful if you are often used a constant from another class in your code and if the static import is not ambiguous.Btw, in your example "import static org.example.Myclass;" won\'t work : import is for class, import static is for static members of a class.The basic idea of static import is that whenever you are using a static class,a static variable or an enum,you can import them and save yourself from some typing.I will elaborate my point with example.Same code, with static imports:Note: static import can make your code confusing to read.the difference between "import static com.showboy.Myclass" and "import com.showboy.Myclass"?The first should generate a compiler error since the static import only works for importing fields or member types. (assuming MyClass is not an inner class or member from showboy)I think you meant which makes all static fields and members from MyClass available in the actual compilation unit without having to qualify them... as explained aboveThe import allows the java programmer to access classes of a package without package qualification. The static import feature allows to access the static members of a class without the class qualification. The import provides accessibility to classes and interface whereas static import provides accessibility to static members of the class.Example :With importWith static importSee also : What is static import in Java 5Say you have static fields and methods inside a class called       myClass    inside a package called myPackage and you want to access them  directly  by typing    myStaticField or    myStaticMethod without typing each time myClass.myStaticField  or    myClass.myStaticMethod.Note : you need to do an\n   import myPackage.MyClass  or myPackage.*\n    for accessing the other resources The static modifier after import is for retrieving/using static fields of a class. One area in which I use import static is for retrieving constants from a class.\nWe can also apply import static on static methods. Make sure to type import static because static import is wrong. A very good link to know about import static is http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/10/what-is-static-import-in-java-5-example-tutorial.htmlYou will be having less code if you use Static import but if you use more rigorously it could be hard to maintain later at some stage.
