I\'m trying to write a function that either accepts a list of strings, or a single string. If it\'s a string, then I want to convert it to an array with just the one item. Then I can loop over it without fear of an error. So how do I check if the variable is an array?I\'ve rounded up the various solutions below and created a jsperf test.The method given in the ECMAScript standard to find the class of Object is to use the toString method from Object.prototype.Or you could use typeof to test if it is a String:Or if you\'re not concerned about performance, you could just do a concat to a new empty Array.EDIT: Check out a thorough treatment from @T.J. Crowder\'s blog, as posted in his comment below.EDIT 2: Check out this benchmark to get an idea which method performs better: http://jsben.ch/#/QgYAVI would first check if your implementation supports isArray:You could also try using the instanceof operatorjQuery also offers an $.isArray() method:In modern browsers you can do(Supported by Chrome 5, Firefox 4.0, IE 9, Opera 10.5 and Safari 5)For backward compatibility you can add the followingIf you use jQuery you can use jQuery.isArray(obj) or $.isArray(obj). If you use underscore you can use _.isArray(obj)If you don\'t need to detect arrays created in different frames you can also just use instanceofThis is the fastest among all methods (all browsers supported):Array.isArray works fast, but it isn\'t supported by all versions of browsers.\nSo you could make an exception for others and use universal method:Simple function to check this:imagine you have this array below: Javascript (new and older browsers):oror then call it like this:Javascript (IE9+, Ch5+, FF4+, Saf5+, Opera10.5+) jQuery:Angular:Underscore and Lodash:You can try this approach: http://web.archive.org/web/20100424091244/http://www.ajaxdr.com/code/javascript-version-of-phps-is_array-function/EDIT: also, if you are already using JQuery in your project, you can use its function $.isArray().As MDN says in here:use Array.isArray or Object.prototype.toString.call to differentiate\n  regular objects from arraysLike this:Object.prototype.toString.call(arr) === \'[object Array]\', orArray.isArray(arr)You can check the type of your variable whether it is an array with;I would make a function to test the type of object you are dealing with...then you can write a simple if statement...https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArrayI do this in a very simple way. Works for me. Any drawbacks?This is my attempt to improve on this answer taking into account the comments:It gets rid of the if/else, and accounts for the possibility of the array being null or undefinedI have updated the jsperf fiddle with two alternative methods as well as error checking.It turns out that the method defining a constant value in the \'Object\' and \'Array\' prototypes is faster than any of the other methods.  It is a somewhat surprising result.These two methods do not work if the variable takes the undefined value, but they do work if you are certain that they have a value.  With regards to checking with performance in mind if a value is an array or a single value, the second method looks like a valid fast method.  It is slightly faster than \'instanceof\' on Chrome, twice as fast as the second best method in Internet Explorer, Opera and Safari (on my machine).I know, that people are looking for some kind of raw javascript approach.\nBut if you want think less about, take a look here: http://underscorejs.org/#isArrayReturns true if object is an Array.There\'s just one line solution for this questionwhere x is the variable it will return true if x is an array and false if it is not.The best solution I\'ve seen is a cross-browser replacement for typeof. Check Angus Croll\'s solution here.The TL;DR version is below, but the article is a great discussion of the issue so you should read it if you have time.Here\'s my lazy approach:I know it\'s sacrilege to "mess with" the prototype, but it appears to perform significantly better than the recommended toString method.Note: A pitfall of this approach is that it wont work across iframe boundaries, but for my use case this is not an issue.There is a nice example in Stoyan Stefanov\'s book JavaScript Patterns which suppose to handle all possible problems as well as utilize ECMAScript 5 method Array.isArray().So here it is:By the way, if you are using jQuery, you can use it\'s method $.isArray()If the only two kinds of values that could be passed to this function are a string or an array of strings, keep it simple and use a typeof check for the string possibility:A simple function for testing if an input value is an array is the following:This works cross browser, and with older browsers. This is pulled from T.J. Crowders\' blog postIn search for shortest version here is what I got so far.Note, there is no perfect function that will always detect all possible combinations. It is better to know all abilities and limitations of your tools than expect a magic tool.This function will turn almost anything into an array:It uses some newer browser features so you may want to polyfill this for maximum support.Examples:N.B. strings will be converted into an array with a single element instead of an array of chars. Delete the isString check if you would prefer it the other way around.I\'ve used Array.isArray here because it\'s the most robust and also simplest.easiest and fastest way to check if an Object is an Array or not.or or you can make a utility function:usage:The following could be used if you know that your object doesn\'t have a concat method.This function has been taken from "JS the good parts" book, works perfect for me.You can try this:
