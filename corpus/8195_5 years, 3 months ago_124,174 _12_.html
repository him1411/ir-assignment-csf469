In a given shell, normally I\'d set a variable or variables and then run a command. Recently I learned about the concept of prepending a variable definition to a command:This works... kind of. It doesn\'t work when you\'re changing a LC_* variable (which seems to affect the command but NOT its arguments, e.g., \'[a-z]\' char ranges) or when piping output to another command thusly:I can prepend somecommand2 with "FOO=bar" as well, which works but which adds unwanted duplication, and it doesn\'t help with arguments that are interpreted depending on the variable (e.g. \'[a-z]\')So, what\'s a good way to do this on a single line? I\'m thinking something on the order of:Edit: I got lots of good answers! The goal is to keep this a one-liner, preferably without using "export". The method using a call to bash was best overall, though the parenthetical version with "export" in it was a little more compact. The method of using redirection rather than a pipe is interesting as well.How about exporting the variable, but only inside the subshell?:Keith has a point, to unconditionally execute the commands, do this:You can also use eval:Since this answer with eval doesn\'t seem to please everyone, let me clarify something: when used as written, with the single quotes, it is perfectly safe. It is good as it will not launch an external process (like the accepted answer) nor will it execute the commands in an extra subshell (like the other answer).As we get a few regular views, it\'s probably good to give an alternative to eval that will please everyone, and has all the benefits (and perhaps even more!) of this quick eval \xe2\x80\x9ctrick\xe2\x80\x9d.  Just use a function! Define a function with all your commands:and execute it with your environment variables like this:How about using a shell script?
