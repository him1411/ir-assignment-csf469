Is there a way to tell Mongo to pretty print output? Currently, everything is output to a single line and it\'s difficult to read, especially with nested arrays and documents.(note: this is answer to original version of the question, which did not have requirements for "default")You can ask it to be pretty.You can addto your file in $HOME/.mongorc.js to enable pretty print globally by default.(note: this is answer to the updated question)You can just do this on the CLI:And it\'s always going to output pretty results.Since it is basically a javascript shell, you can also use toArray():However, this will print all the documents of the collection unlike pretty() that will allow you to iterate.\nRefer: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/cursor.toArray/Oh so i guess .pretty() is equal to:Give a try to Mongo-hacker(node module), it alway prints pretty.\nhttps://github.com/TylerBrock/mongo-hackerMore it enhances mongo shell (supports only ver>2.4, current ver is 3.0), like I am using for while in production env, no problems yet.above command will make your result like this : the stu is the name of my collection , you should use your own collection name instead it. i hope the screenshot help you in a good way.
