I apparently have a redis-server instance running because when I try to start a new server by entering redis-server, I\'m greeted with the following:I can\'t figure out how to stop this server and start a new one.Is there any command I can append to redis-server when I\'m typing in the CLI?My OS is Ubuntu 10.04.Either connect to node instance and use shutdown command or if you are on ubuntu you can try to restart redis server through init.d:or stop/start it:On MacA cleaner, more reliable way is to go into redis-cli and then type shutdownIn redis-cli, type help @server and you will see this near the bottom of the list:SHUTDOWN -   summary: Synchronously save the dataset to disk and then\n  shut down the server   since: 0.07And if you have a redis-server instance running in a terminal, you\'ll see this:redis-cli shutdown is most effective. The accepted answer does not work for me (OSX Lion). Thanks, @JesseBuesking.For osx I created the following aliases for starting and stopping redis (redis installed with homebrew):This has worked great for me for local development.Type SHUTDOWN in the CLIorif your don\'t care about your data in memory, you may also type SHUTDOWN NOSAVE to force shutdown the server.Try killall redis-server. You may also use ps aux to find the name and pid of your server, and then kill it with kill -9 here_pid_number.Option 1: go to redis installation directory and navigate to src , in my case : where 6379 is the default port.Option 2: find redis process and killAnd Then initiate kill:I\'m using Centos 6.7 , x86_64hope it helpsAnother way could be:Works on *NIX & OSXIf you know on what port it would be running(by default it would be 6379), you can use below command to get the pid of the process using that port and then can execute kill command for the same pid.the above command will give you pid.kill <pid>;This would shutdown your server.  MacOSX - It Worked :)Step 1 : Find the previously Running Redis ServerStep 2 : Kill the specific process by finding PID (Process ID) - Redis SeverIn my case it was:To find out what is your service name, you can run:And it will show you every Redis files in your system.stop the redis server type in terminal with root userthe message will be display after stop the redis-serverif you want to start the redis-server typeif you want to restart the server typeUsually this problem arises after I shut down my computer ( or leaving running ) an irregular way.. I believe the port gets stuck open, while the process stops but continues to be bound to the previous port.9/10 times the fix can be:Good to go. I don\'t know specifically for redis, but for servers in general:What OS or distribution?  Often there will be a stop or /etc/init.d/... command that will be able to look up the existing pid in a pid file.You can look up what process is already bound to the port with sudo netstat -nlpt (linux options; other netstat flavors will vary) and signal it to stop.  I would not use kill -9 on a running server unless there really is no other signal or method to shut it down.On MacOSX, This is what worked for mesystemd, ubuntu 16.04:The commands below works for me on Ubuntu Server
