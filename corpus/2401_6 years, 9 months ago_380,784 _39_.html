I have two branches: master and devI want to create a "feature branch" from the dev branch.Currently on the branch dev, I do:... (some work)But, after visualizing my branches, I got:I mean that the branch seems ff merged, and I don\'t understand why...What I\'m doing wrong?Can you explain me please how you branch off from another branch and push back to the remote repository for the feature branch?All that in a branching model like the one described here.If you like the method in the link you\'ve posted, have a look at Git Flow.It\'s a set of scripts he created for that workflow.But to answer your question:Creates MyFeature branch off dev. Do your work and thenNow merge your changes to dev without a fast-forwardeditNow push changes to the serverAnd you\'ll see it how you want it.If you want create a new branch from any of the existing branches in Git, just follow the options.First change/checkout into the branch from where you want to create a new branch. For example, if you have the following branches like:So if you want to create a new branch called "subbranch_of_b1" under the branch named "branch1" follow the steps:Checkout or change into "branch1"Now create your new branch called "subbranch_of_b1" under the "branch1" using the following command.The above will create a new branch called subbranch_of_b1 under the branch branch1 (note that branch1 in the above command isn\'t mandatory since the HEAD is currently pointing to it, you can precise it if you are on a different branch though).Now after working with the subbranch_of_b1 you can commit and push or merge it locally or remotely.Do simultaneous work on the dev branch. What happens is that in your scenario the feature branch moves forward from the tip of the dev branch, but the dev branch does not change. It\'s easier to draw as a straight line, because it can be thought of as forward motion. You made it to point A on dev, and from there you simply continued on a parallel path. The two branches have not really diverged.Now, if you make a commit on dev, before merging, you will again begin at the same commit, A, but now features will go to C and dev to B. This will show the split you are trying to visualize, as the branches have now diverged.VersusCreate a Branch$ git branch branch1$ git branch branch2Checkout a Branchgit checkout command switch branches or restore working tree filesRenaming a BranchDelete a BranchCreate and Switch BranchBranches that are completely included************************** Branch Differences [ git diff branch1..branch2 ] ************************Switched to another branch "branchName"
