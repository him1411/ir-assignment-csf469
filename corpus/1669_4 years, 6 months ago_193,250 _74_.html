Can someone please show me an example of something that can be done with an IntentService that cannot be done with a Service (and vice-versa)?I also believe that an IntentService runs in a different thread and a Service does not.  So, as far as I can see, starting a service within its own thread is like starting an IntentService.  Is it not?I would appreciate if someone can help me with both of my questions.Tejas Lagvankar wrote a nice post about this subject.\nBelow are some key differences between Service and IntentService.When to use?The Service can be used in tasks with no UI, but shouldn\'t be too long.  If you need to perform long tasks, you must use threads within Service.The IntentService can be used in long tasks usually with no communication to Main Thread.  If communication is required, can use Main Thread handler or broadcast intents. Another case of use is when callbacks are needed (Intent triggered tasks).How to trigger?The Service is triggered by calling method startService().The IntentService is triggered using an Intent, it spawns a new worker thread and the method onHandleIntent() is called on this thread.Triggered FromRuns OnThe Service runs in background but it runs on the Main Thread of the application. The IntentService runs on a separate worker thread.Limitations / DrawbacksThe Service may block the Main Thread of the application.The IntentService cannot run tasks in parallel. Hence all the consecutive intents will go into the message queue for the worker thread and will execute sequentially.When to stop?If you implement a Service, it is your responsibility to stop the service when its work is done, by calling stopSelf() or stopService(). (If you only want to provide binding, you don\'t need to implement this method).The IntentService stops the service after all start requests have been handled, so you never have to call stopSelf().If someone can show me an example of something that you can be done with an intentService and can not be done with a Service and the other way around.By definition, that is impossible. IntentService is a subclass of Service, written in Java code. Hence, anything an IntentService does, a Service could do, by including the relevant bits of code that IntentService uses.Starting a service with its own thread is like starting an IntentService. Is it not?The three primary features of an IntentService are:the background threadthe automatic queuing of Intents delivered to onStartCommand(), so if one Intent is being processed by onHandleIntent() on the background thread, other commands queue up waiting their turnthe automatic shutdown of the IntentService, via a call to stopSelf(), once the queue is emptyAny and all of that could be implemented by a Service without extending IntentService.DifferencesServiceIntentServiceAdding points to accepted answer:See the usage of IntentService with in Android API.\neg:To create an IntentService component for your app, define a class that extends IntentService, and within it, define a method that overrides onHandleIntent(). Also see the source code of the IntentService, it\'s consutructor and life cycle methods like onStartCommand..Service together a AsyncTask is one of best approaches for many\n  usecases where payload is  not huge.   or just create a class\n  extending IntentSerivce. From Android version 4.0 all network\n  operations should be in background process otherwise the application compile/build fails.\n  separate thread from the UI. The AsyncTask class provides one of the simplest ways to fire off a new task from the UI thread. For more discussion of this topic, see the blog postfrom Android developers guide:IntentService is a base class for Services that handle asynchronous requests (expressed as Intents) on demand. Clients send requests through startService(Intent) calls; the service is started as needed, handles each Intent in turn using a worker thread, and stops itself when it runs out of work.Design pattern used in IntentService:\nThis "work queue processor" pattern is commonly used to offload tasks from an application\'s main thread. The IntentService class exists to simplify this pattern and take care of the mechanics. To use it, extend IntentService and implement onHandleIntent(Intent). IntentService will receive the Intents, launch a worker thread, and stop the service as appropriate.All requests are handled on a single worker thread -- they may take as long as necessary (and will not block the application\'s main loop), but only one request will be processed at a time.The IntentService class provides a straightforward structure for running an operation on a single background thread. This allows it to handle long-running operations without affecting your user interface\'s responsiveness. Also, an IntentService isn\'t affected by most user interface lifecycle events, so it continues to run in circumstances that would shut down an AsyncTask.An IntentService has a few limitations:It can\'t interact directly with your user interface. To put its results in the UI, you have to send them to an Activity.\nWork requests run sequentially. If an operation is running in an IntentService, and you send it another request, the request waits until the first operation is finished.\nAn operation running on an IntentService can\'t be interrupted.\nHowever, in most casesIntentService is the preferred way to simple background operations**Volley LibraryThere is library called volley-library for developing android networking applications\nSource code is available for public in github.The android official documentation for  Best practices for Background jobs:\nhelps better understand on intent service, thread, handler, service. and also Performing Network OperationsI\'m sure you can find an extensive list of differences by simply googling something such as \'Android IntentService vs Service\' One of the more important differences per example is that IntentService ends itself once it\'s done. Some examples (quickly made up) could be; IntentService: If you want to download a bunch of images at the start of opening your app. It\'s a one-time process and can clean itself up once everything is downloaded. Service: A Service which will constantly be used to communicate between your app and back-end with web API calls. Even if it is finished with its current task, you still want it to be around a few minutes later, for more communication. IntentService runs on its own thread. \nIt will stop itself when its done. More like fire and forget.\nSubsequent calls will be queued. Good for queuing calls.\nYou can also spin multiple threads within IntentServiceif you need to- You can achieve this using ThreadPoolExecutor.\n I say this because many people asked me "why use IntentService since it doesn\'t support parallel execution".\nIntentService is just a thread. You can do whatever you need inside it- Even spinning multiple threads. Only caveat is that IntentService is finish as soon as you spin those multiple threads. It doesn\'t wait for those threads to come back. You need to take care of this . So I recommend using ThreadPoolExecutor in those scenarios.By Default Service runs on the main thread. You need to spin a worker thread to do your job. \nYou need stop service explicitly.\nI used it for situation when you need to run stuff in the background even when you move away from your app and come back more for a Headless service.You can always communicate back to your activity using  BroadcastReceivers if you need to. An IntentService is an extension of a Service that is made to ease the execution of a task that needs to be executed in background and in a seperated thread.IntentService starts, create a thread and runs its task in the thread. once done, it cleans everything. Only one instance of a IntentService can run at the same time, several calls are enqueued.It is very simple to use and very convenient for a lot of uses, for instance downloading stuff. But it has limitations that can make you want to use instead the more basic (not simple) Service.For example, a service connected to a xmpp server and bound by activities cannot be simply done using an IntentService. You\'ll end up ignoring or overriding IntentService stuffs.If someone can show me an example of something that you can be done with an IntentService and can not be done with a service and the other way around.IntentService can not be used for Long Time Listening, Like for XMPP Listeners, its a single time operator, do the job and wave goodbye.Also it has just one threadworker, but with a trick, you can use it as unlimited.main difference :Service class needs a manual stop using stopSelf(). Meanwhile, IntentService automatically stops itself when there is no intent in queue. The IntentService can be used in long tasks usually but If you need to perform long tasks, you must use threads within Service.The Major Difference between a Service and an IntentService is described as follows:Service :1.A Service by default, runs on the application\'s main thread.(here no default worker thread is available).So the user needs to create a separate thread and do the required work in that thread.2.Allows Multiple requests at a time.(Multi Threading)IntentService :1.Now, coming to Intent Service, here a default worker thread is available to perform any operation.Note that - You need to implement onHandleIntent() method ,which receives the intent for each start request, where you can do the background work.2.But it allows only one request at a time.
