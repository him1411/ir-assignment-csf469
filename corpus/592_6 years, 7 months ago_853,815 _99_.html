Which method of checking if a variable has been initialized is better/correct?\n(Assuming the variable could hold anything (string, int, object, function, etc.))ororYou want the typeof operator. Specifically:The typeof operator will check if the variable is really undefined.The typeof operator, unlike the other operators, doesn\'t throw a ReferenceError exception when used with an undeclared variable.However, do note that typeof null will return "object". We have to be careful to avoid the mistake of initializing a variable to null. To be safe, this is what we could use instead:For more info on using strict comparison === instead of simple equality ==, see:Which equals operator (== vs ===) should be used in JavaScript comparisons?In JavaScript, a variable can be defined, but hold the value undefined, so the most common answer is not technically correct, and instead performs the following:That may suffice for your purposes.  The following test has simpler semantics, which makes it easier to precisely describe your code\'s behavior and understand it yourself (if you care about such things):This, of course, assumes you are running in a browser (where window is a name for the global object).  But if you\'re mucking around with globals like this you\'re probably in a browser.  Subjectively, using \'name\' in window is stylistically consistent with using window.name to refer to globals.  Accessing globals as properties of window rather than as variables allows you to minimize the number of undeclared variables you reference in your code (for the benefit of linting), and avoids the possibility of your global being shadowed by a local variable.  Also, if globals make your skin crawl you might feel more comfortable touching them only with this relatively long stick.In the majority of cases you would use:Unlike a simple if (elem), it allows 0, false, NaN and \'\', but rejects null or undefined, making it a good, general test for the presence of an argument, or property of an object.The other checks are not incorrect either, they just have different uses:if (elem): can be used if elem is guaranteed to be an object, or if false, 0, etc. are considered "default" values (hence equivalent to undefined or null).typeof elem == \'undefined\' can be used in cases where a specified null has a distinct meaning to an uninitialised variable or property.Also useful is a strict comparison against undefined:However, because the global undefined can be overridden with another value, it is best to declare the variable undefined in the current scope before using it:Or:A secondary advantage of this method is that JS minifiers can reduce the undefined variable to a single character, saving you a few bytes every time.This is a pretty bulletproof solution for testing if a variable exists and has been initialized :It is most commonly used in combination with a ternary operator to set a default in case a certain variable has not been initialized :Unfortunately, you cannot simply encapsulate your check in a function.You might think of doing something like this :However, this will produce a reference error if you\'re calling eg. isset(foo) and variable foo has not been defined, because you cannot pass along a non-existing variable to a function : Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not definedWhile our isset function cannot be used to test whether a variable exists or not (for reasons explained hereabove), it does allow us to test whether the parameters of a function are undefined :Even though no value for y is passed along to function test, our isset function works perfectly in this context, because y is known in function test as an undefined value.There is another short hand way to check this, when you perform simple assignments and related checks. Simply use Conditional (Ternary) Operator.Also this will be helpful, when you try to declare the Global variable with instance assignment of the reference variable.If you wanted to check variable shouldn\'t be undefined or null. Then perform below check.When the variable is declared, and if you want to check the value, this is even Simple: and it would perform undefined or null checks together.An alternative to the plethora of typeof answers, is the use of hasOwnProperty() which of course checks if an object (pretty much everything in JS) has a property i.e. a variable (amongst other things).The hasOwnProperty() method returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as own (not inherited) property.Every object descended from Object inherits the hasOwnProperty() method. This method can be used to determine whether an object has the specified property as a direct property of that object; unlike the in operator, this method does not check down the object\'s prototype chain.What\'s great about hasOwnProperty() is that in calling it, we don\'t use a variable that might as yet be undefined - which of course is half the problem in the first place.Although not always the perfect or ideal solution, in certain circumstances, it\'s just the job!undefined,boolean,string,number,functionObject,ArrayIt depends if you just care that the variable has been defined or if you want it to have a meaningful value.Checking if the type is undefined will check if the variable has been defined yet.=== null or !== null will only check if the value of the variable is exactly null.== null or != null will check if the value is undefined or null.if(value) will check if the variable is undefined, null, 0, or an empty string.The highest answer is correct, use typeof.However, what I wanted to point out was that in JavaScript undefined is mutable (for some ungodly reason). So simply doing a check for varName !== undefined has the potential to not always return as you expect it to, because other libs could have changed undefined. A few answers (@skalee\'s, for one), seem to prefer not using typeof, and that could get one into trouble.The "old" way to handle this was declaring undefined as a var to offset any potential muting/over-riding of undefined. However, the best way is still to use typeof because it will ignore any overriding of undefined from other code. Especially if you are writing code for use in the wild where who knows what else could be running on the page...Or betterWorks in all browsersIt is difficult to distinguish between undefined and null. Null is a value you can assign to a variable when you want to indicate that the variable has no particular value. Undefined\nis a special value which will be the default value of unassigned variables.In many cases, using :will do the job... it will check these below cases:So it will cover many cases, but there are always weird cases which we\'d like to cover as well, for example a string with spaces, like this \'    \', this will be defined in javascript as it has spaces inside string... for example in this case you add one more check using trim(), like:I also create the image below to show quick brief of the answer:The most robust \'is it defined\' check is with typeofIf you are just checking for a defined variable to assign a default, for an easy to read one liner\nyou can often do this:It\'s often fine to use, see: Idiomatic way to set default value in javascriptThere is also this one liner using the typeof keyword:you can use the typeof operator.For example,Above code snippet will return the output likevariable dataSet is : undefined.Null is a value in JavaScript and typeof null returns "object"Therefore, accepted answer will not work if you pass null values. If you pass null values, you need to add an extra check for null values:In the particular situation outlined in the question,is identical to I prefer the latter since it\'s shorter.Please note that we look up for console only in global scope (which is a window object in all browsers).  In this particular situation it\'s desirable.  We don\'t want console defined elsewhere.@BrianKelley in his great answer explains technical details.  I\'ve only added lacking conclusion and digested it into something easier to read.My preference is typeof(elem) != \'undefined\' && elem != null. However you choose, consider putting the check in a function like soIf you don\'t know the variable is declared then continue with typeof (x) != \'undefined\' && x != null;Where you know the variable is declared but may not be existy, you could use The variable you are checking may be a nested property sometimes. You can use prop || {} to go down the line checking existance to the property in question:After each property use (...\' || {}\').nextProp so that a missing property won\'t throw an error.Or you could use existy like existy(o) && existy(o.p) && existy(o.p.q) && doSomething(o.p.q)These answers (aside from the Fred Gandt solution ) are all either incorrect or incomplete. Suppose I need my variableName; to carry an undefined value, and therefore it has been declared in a manner such as var variableName; which means it\'s already initialized; - How do I check if it\'s already declared?Or even better - how do I immediately check if "Book1.chapter22.paragraph37" exists with a single call, but not rise a reference error?We do it by using the most powerful JasvaScript operator, the in operator.:In times of AJAX peaking popularity I\'ve written a method (later named) isNS() which is capable of determining if the namespace exists including deep tests for property names such as "Book1.chapter22.paragraph37" and a lot more.But since it has been previously published and because of its great importance it deserves to be published in a separate thread I will not post it here but will provide keywords (javascript + isNS ) which will help you locate the source code, backed with all the necessary explanations.It depends on the situation. If you\'re checking for something that may or may not have been defined globally outside your code (like jQuery perhaps) you want:(No need for strict equality there, typeof always returns a string.) But if you have arguments to a function that may or may not have been passed, they\'ll always be defined, but null if omitted.To contribute to the debate, if I know the variable should be a string or an object I always prefer if (!variable), so checking if its falsy. This can bring to more clean code so that, for example:..could be reduced to:I use two different ways depending on the object.Sometimes I do not want to evaluate an empty string as falsey, so then I use this caseIf you need the opposite, then in the first instance !variable becomes !!variable, and in the invalid function === become != and the function names changes to notInvalid.A bit more functional and easy to use:The function will return true if exist, else false if does not exist.What about a simple:To check if a variable has been declared/set I did this dirty trick.I haven\'t found a way to extract the code to a function, even with eval.I can\'t see this in the above answers, so I\'ll suggest it here, I guess.!x will return true iff x is either null or undefined, so !!x will only return true iff x is neither undefined nor null.I realise that this also accounts for the null case, but here\'s fair warning about that.
