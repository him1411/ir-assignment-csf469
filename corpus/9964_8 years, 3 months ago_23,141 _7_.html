I\'ve programmed in both classic ASP and ASP.NET, and I see different tags inside of the markup for server side code.  I\'ve recently come across a good blog on MSDN that goes over the difference between:(<%# is evaluated only at databind, and <%= is evaluated at render), but I also see:I believe <%@ loads things like assemblies and perhaps <%$ loads things from config files?  I\'m not too sure.I was just wondering if anyone could clarify all of this for me and possibly explain why it\'s important to create so many different tags that seemingly have a similar purpose?You\'ve covered 2 of them (<%# is evaluated only at databind, and <%= is evaluated at render), and the answer for "<%@" is that it\'s compiler directives (ie., stuff like what you\'d put on a compiler\'s command line).I don\'t know about "<%$".
