How can I make xargs execute the command exactly once for each line of input given?\nIt\'s default behavior is to chunk the lines and execute the command once, passing multiple lines to each instance. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs: find /path -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rmIn this example, find feeds the input of xargs with a long list of file names. xargs then splits this list into sublists and calls rm once for every sublist. This is more efficient than this functionally equivalent version:find /path -type f -exec rm \'{}\' \\;I know that find has the "exec" flag.  I am just quoting an illustrative example from another resource.\nfrom the man page:It seems to me all existing answers on this page are wrong, including the one marked as correct. That stems from the fact that the question is ambiguously worded.Summary: \xc2\xa0 If you want to execute the command "exactly once for each line of input given," passing the entire line (without the newline) to the command as a single argument, then this is the best UNIX-compatible way to do it:GNU xargs may or may not have useful extensions that allow you to do away with tr, but they are not available on OS X and other UNIX systems.Now for the long explanation\xe2\x80\xa6There are two issues to take into account when using xargs:To test xargs\' behavior, we need an utility that shows how many times it\'s being executed and with how many arguments. I don\'t know if there is a standard utility to do that, but we can code it quite easily in bash:Assuming you save it as show in your current directory and make it executable, here is how it works:Now, if the original question is really about point 2. above (as I think it is, after reading it a few times over) and it is to be read like this (changes in bold):How can I make xargs execute the command exactly once for each argument of input given? Its default behavior is to chunk the input into arguments and execute the command as few times as possible, passing multiple arguments to each instance.then the answer is -n 1. Let\'s compare xargs\' default behavior, which splits the input around whitespace and calls the command as few times as possible:and its behavior with -n 1:If, on the other hand, the original question was about point 1. input splitting and it was to be read like this (many people coming here seem to think that\'s the case, or are confusing the two issues):How can I make xargs execute the command with exactly one argument for each line of input given? Its default behavior is to chunk the lines around whitespace.then the answer is more subtle.One would think that -L 1 could be of help, but it turns out it doesn\'t change argument parsing. It only executes the command once for each input line, with as many arguments as were there on that input line:Not only that, but if a line ends with whitespace, it is appended to the next:Clearly, -L is not about changing the way xargs splits the input into arguments.The only argument that does so in a cross-platform fashion (excluding GNU extensions) is -0, which splits the input around NUL bytes.Then, it\'s just a matter of translating newlines to NUL with the help of tr:Now the argument parsing looks all right, including the trailing whitespace.Finally, if you combine this technique with -n 1, you get exactly one command execution per input line, whatever input you have, which may be yet another way to look at the original question (possibly the most intuitive, given the title):If you want to run the command for every line (i.e. result) coming from find, then what do you need the xargs for?Try:find path -type f -exec your-command {} \\;where the literal {} gets substituted by the filename and the literal \\; is needed for find to know that the custom command ends there.(after the edit of your question clarifying that you know about -exec)From man xargs:-L max-lines\n   Use at most max-lines nonblank input lines per command line.  Trailing\n   blanks cause an input line to be logically continued on the next input line.\n   Implies -x.Note that filenames ending in blanks would cause you trouble if you use xargs:So if you don\'t care about the -exec option, you better use -print0 and -0:I don\'t like the -L answer because it does not handle files with spaces in them which is a key function of find -print0.A better solution is to use tr to convert newlines to null (\\0) characters, and then use the xargs -0 argument.Another problem with using -L also is that it doesn\'t allow multiple arguments for each xargs command call.  For example, the currently accepted solution would call /bin/rm for each of the lines which is a ton of execs.  By using the tr command, then the -n can be used to limit the number of lines read from the input for every invocation of the utility.This also allows you to filter the output of find before converting the breaks into nulls.Another alternative...is all you need.The following command will find all the files (-type f) in /path and then copy them using cp to the current folder.  Note the use if -I % to specify a placeholder character in the cp command line so that arguments can be placed after the file name.find /path -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I % cp % .Tested with xargs (GNU findutils) 4.4.0You can limit the number of lines, or arguments (if there are spaces between each argument) using the --max-lines or --max-args flags, respectively.These two ways also work, and will work for other commands that are not using find!example use case:will delete all pyc files under this directory even if the pyc files contain spaces.It seems I don\'t have enough reputation to add a comment to Tobia\'s answer above, so I am adding this "answer" to help those of us wanting to experiment with xargs the same way on the Windows platforms.Here is a windows batch file that does the same thing as Tobia\'s quickly coded "show" script:In your example, the point of piping the output of find to xargs is that the standard behavior of find\'s -exec option is to execute the command once for each found file. If you\'re using find, and you want its standard behavior, then the answer is simple - don\'t use xargs to begin with.execute ant task clean-all on every build.xml on current or sub-folder.
