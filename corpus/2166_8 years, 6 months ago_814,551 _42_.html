Are there any JavaScript or jQuery APIs or methods to get the dimensions of an image on the page?clientWidth and clientHeight are DOM properties that show the current in-browser size of the inner dimensions of a DOM element (excluding margin and border). So in the case of an IMG element, this will get the actual dimensions of the visible image.You can programmatically get the image and check the dimensions using Javascript...This can be useful if the image is not a part of the markup.Also (in addition to Rex and Ian\'s answers) there is:andThese provide the height and width of the image file itself (rather than just the image element).If you are using jQuery and you are requesting image sizes you have to wait until they load or you will only get zeroes.I think an update to these answers is useful because one of the best-voted replies suggests using clientWidth and clientHeight, which I think is now obsolete.I have done some experiments with HTML5, to see which values actually get returned.First of all, I used a program called Dash to get an overview of the image API.\nIt states that height and width are the rendered height/width of the image and that naturalHeight and naturalWidth are the intrinsic height/width of the image (and are HTML5 only).I used an image of a beautiful butterfly, from a file with height 300 and width 400. And this Javascript:Then I used this HTML, with inline CSS for the height and width.Results:I then changed the HTML to the following:i.e. using height and width attributes rather than inline stylesResults:I then changed the HTML to the following:i.e. using both attributes and CSS, to see which takes precedence.Results:Using JQuery you do this:The thing all other have forgot is that you cant check image size before it loads. When the author checks all of posted methods it will work probably only on localhost. Since jQuery could be used here, remember that \'ready\' event is fired before images are loaded. $(\'#xxx\').width() and .height() should be fired in onload event or later.You can only really do this using a callback of the load event as the size of the image is not known until it has actually finished loading. Something like the code below...ok guys, i think i improved the source code to be able to let the image load before trying to find out its properties, otherwise it will display \'0 * 0\', because the next statement would have been called before the file was loaded into the browser. Requires jquery...With jQuery library-Use .width() and .height().More in jQuery width and jQuery heigth.Before using real image size you should load source image. If you use JQuery framework  you can get real image size in simple way.This answer was exactly what I was looking for (in jQuery):JQuery Answer:Simply, you can test like this.Nicky De Maeyer asked after a background picture; I simply get it from the css and replace the "url()":Recently I had same issue for an error in the flex slider. The first image\'s height was set smaller due to the loading delay. I tried the following method for resolving that issue and it\'s worked.    This will give you the height with respect to the width you set rather than original width or  Zero. You can apply the onload handler property when the page loads in js or jquery like this:-This is my method, hope this helpful. :)You can also use:it is important to remove the browser interpreted setting from the parent div. So if you want the real image width and height you can just use This is one TYPO3 Project example from me where I need the real properties of the image to scale it with the right relation. this work for multiple image preview and upload . if you have to select for each of the images one by one . Then copy and past into all the preview image function and validate!!!Before acquire element\'s attributes,the document page should be onload:
