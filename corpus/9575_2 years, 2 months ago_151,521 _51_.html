I am trying to get my first Typescript and DefinitelyTyped node app up and running, and running into some errors.I am getting the error "TS2304: Cannot find name \'require\' " when I attempt to transpile a simple ts node page.  I have read through several other occurrences of this error on SO and I do not think I have similar issues.\nI am running at the shell prompt the command : tsc movie.server.model.ts.   The contents of this file are:The error is thrown on the var mongoose=require(\'mongoose\') lineThe contents of the typings/tsd.d.ts file are:The .d.ts file references were placed in the appropriate folders and added to typings/tsd.d.ts by the commands:The produced .js file seems to work fine, so I could ignore the error.  But I would appreciate knowing why this error occurs and what I am doing wrong.If you are using TypeScript 2.x you no longer need to have Typings or Definitely Typed installed. Simply install the following package.The Future of Declaration Files (6/15/2016)Tools like Typings and tsd will continue to work, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be working\n  alongside those communities to ensure a smooth transition.OPTIONAL:\nIf you are specifying typeroots or types in your tsconfig.json. You may need to update the tsconfig.json to include node as a type.  By default any package under @types is already included in your build unless you\'ve specified either of these options.  Read more Below is proper configuration for each of these options.Using typings (DefinitelyTyped\'s replacement) you can specify a definition directly from a GitHub repository.Install typingsInstall the requireJS type definition from DefinitelyType\'s repoIf you just have one file using require, or you\'re doing this for demo purposes you can define require at the top of your TypeScript file.If you\'re attempting to use a require statement in your Angular CLI project, update tsconfig.app.json to include node typings.For TypeScript 2.x, there are now two steps:Install a package that defines require. For example:Tell TypeScript to include it globally in tsconfig.json:The second step is only important if you need access to globally available functions such as require. For most packages, you should just use the import package from \'package\' pattern. There\'s no need to include every package in the tsconfig.json types array above.You canOr, for more comprehensive support, use DefinitelyTyped\'s require.d.tsAlso, instead of var mongoose = require(\'mongoose\'), you could try the following Instead of:Try: i.e. reference path first.I found the solution was to use the TSD command:Which adds/updates the typings/tsd.d.ts file and that file contains all the type definitions that are required for a node application.At the top of my file, I put a reference to the tsd.d.ts like this:The require is defined like this as of January 2016:I took Peter Varga\'s answer to add declare var require: any; and made it into a generic solution that works for all .ts files generically by using the preprocess-loader:install preprocessor-loader:add the loader to your webpack.config.js (I\'m using ts-loader for processing TypeScript sources):You can add the more robust require.d.ts the same way, but declare var require: any; was sufficient in my situation.Note, there\'s a bug in preprocessor 1.0.5, which cuts off the last line, so just make sure you have an extra line space return at the end and you\'ll be fine.I\'ve been struggling from this issue as well. I believe that this works for all release candidates aka rc but I didn\'t test is though. For @angular rc.2 it works well.Cheers!Did you specify what module to use to transpile the code?\ntsc --target es5 --module commonjs script.ts\nYou must do that to let the transpiler know that you\'re compiling NodeJS code. Docs.You must install mongoose definitions as well\ntsd install mongoose --saveDo not use var to declare variables (unless necessary, which is a very rare case),  use let instead.  Learn more about thatI couldn\'t get the \'require\' error to go away by using any of the tricks above.but I found out that the issue was that my typescript tools for visual studio where an old version (1.8.6.0) and the latest version as of today is  (2.0.6.0)You can download the latest version of the tools from:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48593Just in addition to cgatian\'s answer, for TypeScript 1.xIf you are still seeing errors, please specifically provide index.d.ts in your compiler options.If you can compile code but Visual Studio 2015 marks \'require\' functions as errors with error text cannot find name \'require\' or cannot resolve symbol \'require\' update TypeScript for Visual Studio 2015 to the latest version (at the moment 2.1.5) and update ReSharper (if you use it) to at least version 2016.3.2.I had this annoying problem for a while, couldn\'t find a solution, but finally resolved it this way. Hope this helps to someone.Sometime missing "jasmine" from tsconfig.json may cause this error. (Typescript 2.X)so addto your tsconfig.json
