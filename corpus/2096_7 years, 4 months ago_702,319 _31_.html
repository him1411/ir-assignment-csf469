I have a comma separated string that I want to convert into an array so I can loop through it.Is there anything built-in to do this?For e.g. I have this stringnow want to split this by comma and store in Array objectMDN reference, mostly helpful for the possibly unexpected behavior of the limit parameter. (Hint: "a,b,c".split(",", 2) comes out to ["a", "b"], not ["a", "b,c"].)Watch out if you are aiming at integers, like 1,2,3,4,5. If you intend to use the elements of your array as integers and not as strings after splitting the string, consider converting them into such.adding a loop like thiswill return an array containing integers, and not strings.Hmm split is dangerous imho as a string can always contain a comma, observe the following: So how would you interperate that? and what do you WANT the result to be? an array with: even if you escape the comma you\'d have a problem.Quickly fiddled this together: Feel free to use / edit it :) In javascript and PHP you have these two very powerful functions:JS: String.split(String) Array.join(String);PHP: explode(string,string) implode(string,array)The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.note that:will alert 1Pass you Comma Separated string into this function and it will return array , and if not \ncomma separated string then will return null.its accept string and objectstringsJSFiddle  https://jsfiddle.net/7ne9L4Lj/1/I know this question has been answered for quite a while, but I thought that my contribution would be beneficial to others researching this topic...Here is a function that will convert a string to an array, even if there is only one item in the list (no separator character):Use it like this:I created this function because split throws out an error if there is no separator character in the string (only one item)I had a similar issue, but more complex as I needed to transform a csv into an array of arrays (each line is one array element that inside has an array of items split by comma).The easiest solution (and more secure I bet) was to use PapaParse (http://papaparse.com/) which has a "no-header" option that transform the csv into an array of arrays, plus, it automatically detected the "," as my delimiter.Plus, it is registered in bower, so I only had to:and then use it in my code as follows:I really liked it.
