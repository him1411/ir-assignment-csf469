I\'m trying to find a way to scan my entire Linux system for all files containing a specific string of text. Just to clarify, I\'m looking for text within the file, not in the file name.When I was looking up how to do this, I came across this solution twice:However, it doesn\'t work. It seems to display every single file in the system.Is this close to the proper way to do it? If not, how should I? This ability to find text strings in files would be extraordinarily useful for some programming projects I\'m doing.Do the following:Along with these, --exclude, --include, --exclude-dir or --include-dir flags could be used for efficient searching:This will only search through those files which have .c or .h extensions:This will exclude searching all the files ending with .o extension:This works very well for me, to achieve almost the same purpose like yours.For more options check man grep.You can use grep -ilR:You can use ack. It is like grep for source code. You can scan your entire file system with it.Just do:In your root directory.You can also use regular expressions, specify the filetype, etc.UPDATEI just discovered The Silver Searcher, which is like ack but 3-5x faster than it and even ignores patterns from a .gitignore file.You can use:The r stands for recursive and so will search in the path specified and also its sub-directories. This will tell you the file name as well as print out the line in the file where the string appears.Or a command similar to the one you are trying (example: ) for searching in all javascript files (*.js):This will print the lines in the files where the text appears, but it does not print the file name.You can use this:If your grep doesn\'t support recursive search, you can combine find with xargs:I find this easier to remember than the format for find -exec.This will output the filename and the content of the matched line, e.g.Optional flags you may want to add to grep:First of all, I believe you have used -H instead of -l. Also you can try adding the text inside quotes followed by {} \\.Even if you are not use about the case like "text" vs "TEXT", you can use the -i switch to ignore case. You can read further details here. Hope this helps you.Try:Use pwd to search from any directory you are in, recursing downwardUpdate\nDepending on the version of grep you are using, you can omit pwd. On newer versions . seems to be the default case for grep if no directory is given\nthus:grep -rnw -e "pattern" or grep -rnw "pattern" will do the same thing as above!If you know the extension of your source files (and the project is not too big), use:within the folder of your interest.The magic here is within using extended globbing (**) which helps you to scan all the files recursively with specific extension. If doesn\'t work, activate it by shopt -s globstar. You may also use **/*.* for all files (excluding hidden and without extension).Add the following useful parameters (most common for source code searching):If you\'ve the error that your argument is too long, consider narrowing down your search, or use find syntax instead.Here are the several list of commands that can be used to search file.There\'s a new utility called The SilversearcherIt works closely with Git and other VCS. So you won\'t get anything in a .git or another directory.You can simply useAnd it will do the task for you!Try:which will search all file systems, because / is the root folder.For home folder use:For current folder use:grep can be used even if we\'re not looking for a string.Simply running,will print out the path to all text files, i.e. those containing only printable characters.Explanation from commentsfind is a command that lets you find files and other objects like directories and links in subdirectories of a given path. If you don\'t specify a mask that filesnames should meet, it enumerates all directory objects.Hope this is of assistance...Expanding the grep a bit to give more information in the output, for example, to get the line number in the file where the text is can be done as follows:And if you have an idea what the file type is you can narrow your search down by specifying file type extensions to search for, in this case .pas OR .dfm files:Short explanation of the options:A Simple find can work handy. alias it in your ~/.bashrc file:Start a new terminal and issue:I wrote a Python script which does something similar. This is how one should use this script.The first argument, path, is the directory in which we will search recursively. The second argument, pattern_to_search, is a regular expression which we want to search in a file. We use the regular expression format defined in the Python re library. In this script, the . also matches newline.The third argument, file_pattern, is optional. This is another regular expression which works on a filename. Only those files which matches this regular expression will be considered. For example, if I want to search Python files with the extension py containing Pool( followed by word Adaptor, I do the following,And voila, it generates the path of matched files and line number at which the match was found. If more than one match was found, then each line number will be appended to the filename.The below command will work fine for this approach:To search for the string and output just that line with the search string: e.g.:To display filename containing the search string:e.g.:If you have a set of files that you will always be checking you can alias their paths, for example:Then you can simply filter the list like this:Which filters out the list fd to files that contain the CR pattern.I find that aliasing the files that I am interested in helps me create easier scripts then always trying to remember how to get all those files.  The recursive stuff works as well but sooner or later you are going to have to contend with weeding out specific file types.  Which is is why I just find all the file types I\'m interested in to begin with.Avoid the hassle and install ack-grep. It eliminates a lot of permission and quotation issues.Then go to the directory you want to search and run the command belowUse:This will report how many copies of your pattern are there in each of the files in the current directory.Try thisI came across this solution\n  twice:find / -type f -exec grep -H \'text-to-find-here\' {} \\;(...)Is this close to the proper way to do it?Short answer: Yes, it is very close.Long answer: This command is correct.Using just grep -r (grep --recursive) is more straightforward:grep \'text-to-find-here\' -r <path_to_search>However, your command (combining find and grep) comes in handy sometimes, for example on systems where the grep command doesn\'t support -r (--recursive), so let\'s examine the rest of the question:find / -type f -exec grep -H \'text-to-find-here\' {} \\;(...)However, it doesn\'t work. It seems to display every single file in the system.You probably get error messages such asYou can avoid these by adding option -s (or --no-messages) to grep.But then you still get errors likeTo avoid this, you can add 2>/dev/null at the end of your command, to discard all error messages, which gives:find / -type f -exec grep -sH \'text-to-find-here\' {} \\; 2>/dev/nullYou can use the below command as you don\'t want a file name, but you want to search from all the files. Here are I am capturing "TEXT" from all the log files, making sure that the file name is not printed:Using grep with the -e option is quite quick compared to other options as it is for a PATTERN match.The command will search recursivly in all files and directories of the current directory and print the result.Note: if your grep output isn\'t colored, you can change it by using the grep=\'grep --color=always\' alias in your shell src fileSilver Searcher is a terrific tool, but ripgrep may be even better.  It works on Linux, Mac and Windows, and was written up on Hacker News a couple of months ago (this has a link to Andrew Gallant\'s Blog which has a GitHub link):Ripgrep \xe2\x80\x93 A new command line search toolAll previous answers suggest grep and find. But there is another way: Use midnight commanderIt is a free utility (30 years old, proven by time) which is visual without being GUI. Has tons of functions, finding files is just one of them.
