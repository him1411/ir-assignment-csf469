Sprockets tends to be quite verbose in the (dev) log by default under Rails 3.1 (RC1):I\'d like to either reduce the level of verbosity or disable it altogether.\nI\'m assuming there is a clean way to disable or reduce the verbosity of the logging by adding a config line in either environment.rb or development.rb similar to config.active_record.logger = nil which silences ActiveRecord SQL statements.Place the following code in config/initializers/quiet_assets.rbUpdated: now works for Rails 3.2 too (previous attempt fixes before_dispatch now we\'re going for the root rack call instead)Update: A proper Rack middleware solution (instead of fragile alias_method_chain)  from @macournoyer https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2639#issuecomment-6591735Take a look at https://github.com/evrone/quiet_assets and just include it into your GemfileFor lazy: gem \'quiet_assets\', group: :developmentFor Rails 3.2, add config.assets.logger = false to your development environment configuration file, typically found at config/environments/development.rb . See #4512Eventually, it will be config.assets.logger = nil but that part is currently stubbed on master (not done yet)Two things is enough:\n1. config.assets.debug = false in config/enviroments/development.rb\n2. rake assets:precompile.  See comment by @oma below; this is not neededThats all!I know it\'s an ugly and temporary solution but i use this :tail -f log/development.log | grep -vE \'asset\'Many people are confused about the use of config.assets.logger = false. Here is what it does and what it doesn\'t do.According the source documentation:Setting config.assets.logger to false will turn off served assets logging.However this probably is not what you think it is. It only disables sprocket \'serving\' logs, not Rails actionpack request logs. The Rails maintainer explains this clearly here: \nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/issues/4569#issuecomment-3594500Taking example from the link, logs like this are disabled:Served asset /jquery.isotope.js - 304 Not Modified (0ms)But logs like this are not Started GET "/assets/jquery.isotope.js?body=1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2012-01-20 23:16:46 -0500in development.rb in config/environments you\'ll find the line config.assets.debug = true. Switch that to false and most of the asset load output will be gone. On my system only the two requests for application.css and .js remain.This is the latest way to go.it\'s the same code @choonkeat added. I just included to work under windows as well.In config/environments/development.rb please add:    config.assets.debug = falseconfig.assets.logger = falseThis will help toward your problem. Lograge for the win- It kills Rails\' annoying logger defaults out of the box (e.g. logging assets, logging partial rendering), and is customizable if you want to add/remove specific items.The below mentioned link solution helps:https://github.com/evrone/quiet_assetsAlso as below it\'s working fine for me3.1 (only) (3.2 breaks before_dipatch)In config/environments add config.log_level = :error to the .rb files you want to change. This will change the log settings to error only.\nI hope this helped!
