In SQL I (sadly) often have to use "LIKE" conditions due to databases that violate nearly every rule of normalization. I can\'t change that right now. But that\'s irrelevant to the question.Further, I often use conditions like WHERE something in (1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21) for better readability and flexibility of my SQL statements.Is there any possible way to combine these two things without writing complicated sub-selects?I want something as easy as WHERE something LIKE (\'bla%\', \'%foo%\', \'batz%\') instead ofI\'m working with SQl Server and Oracle here but I\'m interested if this is possible in any RDBMS at all.There is no combination of LIKE & IN in SQL, much less in TSQL (SQL Server) or PLSQL (Oracle).  Part of the reason for that is because Full Text Search (FTS) is the recommended alternative.Both Oracle and SQL Server FTS implementations support the CONTAINS keyword, but the syntax is still slightly different:Reference:If you want to make your statement easily readable, then you can use REGEXP_LIKE (available from Oracle version 10 onwards).An example table:The original syntax:And a simple looking query with REGEXP_LIKEBUT ...I would not recommend it myself due to the not-so-good performance. I\'d stick with the several LIKE predicates. So the examples were just for fun.you\'re stuck with the unless you populate a temp table (include the wild cards in with the data) and join like this:try it out (using SQL Server syntax):OUTPUT:With PostgreSQL there is the ANY or ALL form:orwhere the subselect returns exactly one column of data.I would suggest using a TableValue user function if you\'d like to encapsulate the Inner Join or temp table techniques shown above.  This would allow it to read a bit more clearly.After using the split function defined at: http://www.logiclabz.com/sql-server/split-function-in-sql-server-to-break-comma-separated-strings-into-table.aspxwe can write the following based on a table I created called "Fish" (int id, varchar(50) Name)OutputsOne approach would be to store the conditions in a temp table (or table variable in SQL Server) and join to that like this:Use an inner join instead:u can even try thisFunctionQueryAnother solution, should work on any RDBMS:For Sql Server you can resort to Dynamic SQL.Most of the time in such situations you have the parameter of IN clause based on some data from database.The example below is a little "forced", but this can match various real cases found in legacy databases.  Suppose you have table Persons where person names are stored in a single field PersonName as FirstName + \' \' + LastName. \nYou need to select all persons from a list of first names, stored in field NameToSelect in table NamesToSelect, plus some additional criteria (like filtered on gender, birth date, etc)You can do it as followsI may have a solution for this, although it will only work in SQL Server 2008 as far as I know. I discovered that you can use the row-constructor described in https://stackoverflow.com/a/7285095/894974 to join a \'fictional\' table using a like clause.\nIt sounds more complex then it is, look:This will result in all users with an e-mail adres like the ones provided in the list.\nHope it\'s of use to anyone. The problem had been bothering me a while.If you are using MySQL the closest you can get is full-text search:Full-Text Search, MySQL DocumentationThis works for comma separated valuesEvaluates to:If you want it to use indexes, you must omit the first \'%\' character.In Oracle you can use a collection in the following way:Here I have used a predefined collection type ku$_vcnt, but you can declare your own one like this:I have a simple solution, that works in postgresql at least, using like any followed by the list of regex. Here is an example, looking at identifying some antibiotics in a list:I was also wondering for something like that. I just tested using a combination of SUBSTRING and IN and it is an effective solution for this kind of problem. Try the below query :In Oracle RBDMS you can achieve this behavior using REGEXP_LIKE function.The following code will test if the string three is present in the list expression one|two|three|four|five (in which the pipe "|" symbol means OR logic operation). Preceding expression is equivalent to:So it will succeed.On the other hand, the following test will fail.There are several functions related to regular expressions (REGEXP_*) available in Oracle since 10g version. If you are an Oracle developer and interested this topic this should be a good beginning Using Regular Expressions with Oracle Database.do thisor
