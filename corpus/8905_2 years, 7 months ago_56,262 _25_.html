Android Docs say:The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of\n  ListView. This widget is a container for displaying large data sets\n  that can be scrolled very efficiently by maintaining a limited number\n  of views. Use the RecyclerView widget when you have data collections\n  whose elements change at runtime based on user action or network\n  eventsActually ListView can do all of the above if efficiency doesn\'t matter, and we have found many issues when we use RecyclerView to replace ListView:There is no onItemClickListener() for list item selection - solutionNo divider between list items - solutionNo built-in overlap selector, there is no visual feedback when you click list item - solutionNo addHeaderView for list header - solutionMaybe more issues ...So when we use RecyclerView to replace ListView, we have to do much extra coding to reach the same effect as ListView. QUESTION:Thanks for your attention and any idea!If ListView works for you, there is no reason to migrate.\nIf you are writing a new UI, you might be better off with RecyclerView.RecyclerView is powerful when you need to customize your list or you want better animations. Those convenience methods in ListView caused a lot of trouble to people which is why RecyclerView provides a more flexible solution to them.The major change you need to make for migration is in your adapter. If you want to keep calling notifyDataSetChanged, you lose most of the animation & binding benefits. But if you can change your adapter to dispatch detailed notify events (added/removed/moved/updated), then you get much better animations and performance. These events let RecyclerView choose correct animations and it also helps it avoid unnecessary onBind calls. You\'ll get a huge benefit if your item views are complex. Also, going forward, there will be more components around RecyclerView.According to me, if ListView fulfills all the current needs of your app and satisfies all use-cases then there is no need to replace it with a RecyclerView.The RecyclerView gives huge power to its developers at the cost of increasing the complexity for the developers. There are certain things which could be done easily in a ListView can now take a lot of unnecessary effort. But yes, there are many things that a ListView can never do, like the amazing LayoutManager feature which can allow you to dynamically change the layout to horizontal, vertical, grid, or staggered grid seamlessly.I wrote a detailed answer on this topic here.1 You can use an interface to provide a click listener. I use this technique with ListViews, too.\n2 No divider: Simply add in your row a View with a width of match_parent and a height of 1dp and give it a background color.\n3 Simply use a StateList selector for the row background.\n4  addHeaderView can be avoided in ListViews, too: simply put the Header outside the View.So, if efficiency is your concern, then yes, it\'s a good idea to replace a ListView with a RecyclerView.The only case when it\'s still fine to use ListView is when the list is not dynamic or affected by network events. For example: navigation.   For any other uses, RecyclerView eclipses ListView. Since RecyclerView only cares about recycling it will be easier to do visual related things that were tightly coupled in ListView, like changing position / rearrangement, animation (in fact it comes with RecyclerView.ItemAnimator), custom layouts (the stock has StaggeredGrid in addition to the old list or grid style but there\'s also this library which extends it even more).Also if you want to use CardView I believe it\'s the only way to go (some good reading when to use card or list).A great alternative is using the BaseAdapter. It supports the use Viewholder pattern and mine contains 100+ rows with bitmaps and buttons and it runs very smooth.
