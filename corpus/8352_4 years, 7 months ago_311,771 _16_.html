I have some CSS that looks like this: I would like to replace the image with an icon from Font Awesome.I do not see anyway to use the icon in CSS as a background image. Is this possible to do assuming the Font Awesome stylesheets/fonts are loaded before my CSS? You can\'t use text as a background image, but you can use the :before or :after pseudo classes to place a text character where you want it, without having to add all kinds of messy extra mark-up.Be sure to set position:relative on your actual text wrapper for the positioning to work.Further to the answer from Diodeus above, you need the font-family: FontAwesome rule (assuming you have the @font-face rule for FontAwesome declared already in your CSS). Then it is a matter of knowing which CSS content value corresponds to which icon. I have listed them all here: http://astronautweb.co/snippet/font-awesome/Consolidating everything above, the following is the final class which works wellActually even font-awesome CSS has a similar strategy for setting their icon styles.  If you want to get a quick hold of the icon code, check the non-minified font-awesome.css file and there they are....each font in its purity.No need to embed content into the CSS. You can put the badge content inside the fa element, then adjust the badge css. http://jsfiddle.net/vmjwayrk/2/in mine working this cssUse the following Python program via command line to create png images from Font-Awesome icons:https://github.com/Pythonity/font-awesome-to-pngFor this you just need to add content attribute and font-family attribute to the required element via :before or :after wherever applicable.For example: I wanted to attach an attachment icon after all the a element inside my post. So, first I need to search if such icon exists in fontawesome. Like in the case I found it here, i.e. fa fa-paperclip. Then I would right click the icon there, and go the ::before pseudo property to fetch out the content tag it is using, which in my case I found to be \\f0c6. Then I would use that in my css like this:
