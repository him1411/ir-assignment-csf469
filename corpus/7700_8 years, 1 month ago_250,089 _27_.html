Coming from a Java world into a C# one is there a HashMap equivalent? If not what would you recommend?Dictionary is probably the closest. System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary implements the System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary interface (which is similar to Java\'s Map interface).Some notable differences that you should be aware of:Dictionary\'s has a ContainsKey method that can help deal with the previous two problems.From C# equivalent to Java HashMapI needed a Dictionary which accepted a "null" key, but there seems to be no native one, so I have written my own. It\'s very simple, actually. I inherited from Dictionary, added a private field to hold the value for the "null" key, then overwritten the indexer. It goes like this :Hope this helps someone in the future.==========I modified it to this formatCheck out the documentation on MSDN for the Hashtable class. Represents a collection of key-and-value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key. Also, keep in mind that this is not thread-safe.Let me help you understand it with an example of "codaddict\'s algorithm"\'Dictionary in C#\' is \'Hashmap in Java\' in parallel universe.Some implementations are different. See the example below to understand better.Declaring Java HashMap:Declaring C# Dictionary:Getting a value from a location:Setting a value at location:An Overall Example can be observed from below Codaddict\'s algorithm.codaddict\'s algorithm in Java:Codaddict\'s algorithm in C#I think it\'s better to give examples as to tell one favorite..\nSo check this Collections and decide which collection do you want to use.the answer is Dictionarytake look at my function, its simple add uses most important member functions inside Dictionarythis function return false if the list contain Duplicates items
