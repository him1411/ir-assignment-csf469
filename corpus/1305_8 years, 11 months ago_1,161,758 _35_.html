I have a database with account numbers and card numbers. I match these to a file to update any card numbers to the account number, so that I am only working with account numbers. I created a view linking the table to the account/card database to return the Table ID and the related account number, and now I need to update those records where the ID matches with the Account Number.This is the Sales_Import table, where the account number field needs to be updated:And this is the RetrieveAccountNumber table, where I need to update from:I tried the below, but no luck so far:It updates the card numbers to account numbers, but the account numbers gets replaced by NULLI believe an UPDATE FROM with a JOIN will help:The simple Way to copy the content from one table to other is as follow:You can also add the condition to get the particular data copied.For SQL Server 2008 + Using MERGE rather than the proprietary UPDATE ... FROM syntax has some appeal. As well as being standard SQL and thus more portable it also will raise an error in the event of there being multiple joined rows on the source side (and thus multiple possible different values to use in the update) rather than having the final result be undeterministic.Unfortunately the choice of which to use may not come down purely to preferred style however. The implementation of MERGE in SQL Server has been afflicted with various bugs. Aaron Bertrand has compiled a list of the reported ones here.Seems you are using MSSQL, then, if I remember correctly, it is done like this:I had the same problem with foo.new being set to null for rows of foo that had no matching key in bar. I did something like this in Oracle:Generic answer for future developers. For PostgreSQL:For MySql that works fine:Thanks for the responses. I found a solution tho.For MySql:For Sql Server:I have used all above queries, but they\'re not working; and when I used this one, it\'s done.You can catch it from here also,  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5036918/update-one-table-with-data-from-anotherHope u get it. thanksupdate within the same table:it works with postgresqlI thought this is a simple example might someone get it easier, The below SQL someone suggested, does NOT work in SQL Server. This syntax reminds me of my old school class:All other queries using NOT IN or NOT EXISTS are not recommended. NULLs show up because OP compares entire dataset with smaller subset, then of course there will be matching problem. This must be fixed by writing proper SQL with correct JOIN instead of dodging problem by using NOT IN. You might run into other problems by using NOT IN or NOT EXISTS in this case.My vote for the top one, which is conventional way of updating a table based on another table by joining in SQL Server. Like I said, you cannot use two tables in same UPDATE statement in SQL Server unless you join them first.This will allow you to update a table based on the column value not being found in another table.This will update a table based on the column value being found in both tables.try this :I\'d like to add one extra thing.Don\'t update a value with the same value, it generates extra logging and unnecessary overhead. \nSee example below - it will only perform the update on 2 records despite linking on 3.I want to add this update for Access SQL or VBA code : we have to do the JOIN before the SET.
