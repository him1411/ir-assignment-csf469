How can I customize the navigation back button in iOS 7 and above without title? (i.e. with the arrow only)I\'m just wondering if they have any self.backButtonItem;OR something like this?It\'s actually pretty easy, here is what I do:Objective CSwiftPut this line in the view controller that is pushing on to the stack. The newly pushed view controller back button will now show whatever you put for initWithTitle, which in this case is an empty string. I found an easy way to make my back button with iOS single arrow.Let\'s supouse that you have a navigation controller going to ViewA from ViewB. In IB, select ViewA\'s navigation bar, you should see these options: Title, Prompt and Back Button.ViewA navigate bar optionsThe trick is choose your destiny view back button title (ViewB) in the options of origin view (View A). If you don\'t fill the option "Back Button", iOS will put the title "Back" automatically, with view origin\'s title. So, you need to fill this option with a single space.Fill space in "Back Button" optionThe Result:Just use an image! Icon-Back.png Icon-Back@2x.png Icon-Back@3x.pngiOS7 has new interface rules, so It\'s better to keep at least the back arrow when you push a UIView.\nIt\'s very easy to change the "back" text programmatically. Just add this code before push the view (Or prepareForSegue if you are using StoryBoards):This will change the default "Back" text, but will keep the iOS7 styled back arrow.\nYou can also change the tint color for the back arrow before push the view:Hope this helps you!Nothing much you need to do. You can achieve the same through storyboard itself. Just go the root Navigation controller and give a space. Remember not to the controller you wanted the back button without title, but to the root navigation controller.While Kyle Begeman\'s answer totally does the trick, it is quite annoying to have this code in every view controller possible. I ended up with a simple UINavigationItem category. Beware, here be dragons! Sorry, I mean, swizzling:EDIT: 2014-04-09: As I gained reputations, I feel sorry because I don\'t use this trick any more. I recommend Kyle\'s answer. Also notice that the self of self.navigationItem.backBarButtonItem isn\'t the view controller the back button is displayed, but the previous view controller to be went back. If you don\'t need to have title text for the previous view controller, just fill the title with a blank string;This will prevent showing "back" with chevron on the pushed view controller.EDIT: Even you use non-blank title text, setting the title of the previous view controller in viewWillAppear: works except the title can flicker in a blink when view controller popped. I think "The twitter app" seems to do more subtle hack to avoid the flicker.This works, but it will remove the title of the previous item, even if you pop back to it:Just set this property on viewDidLoad of the pushed View Controller.You don\'t have access to the navigation backButtonItem with the way you want, you need to create your own back button like below:And off course:Simple hack from iOS6 works on iOS7 too:Edit:\nDon\'t use this hack. See comment for details.Target:\ncustomizing all back button on UINavigationBar to an white iconSteps:\n1. in "didFinishLaunchingWithOptions" method of AppDelete\xef\xbc\x9a2.in the viewDidLoad method of the common super ViewController class:This is how I do it and the simplest, works and most clear way to do it.This works if embed on Navigation ControllerSwift 3In viewDidLoad I add this to the View Controller you want the back button to be just arrow.The difference of this to @Kyle Begeman\'s answer is that you call this on the view controller that you want the back button to be just arrow, not on the pushing stack view controller.you can use this. This works perfectly for me by just adding a UIButton as a custumview for the UIBarButtonItem.Try the Below CodeAll the answers do not solve the issue. It is not acceptable to set back button title in every view controller and adding offset to the title still makes next View Controller title shift to the right.Here is the method using method swizzling, just create new extension to UINavigationItemCreate a UILabel with the title you want for your root view controller and assign it to the view controller\'s navigationItem.titleView.Now set the title to an empty string and the next view controller you push will have a back button without text.Set back title emptyChange back image I have been using this solution since iOS 5 or so without any problems. I made a utility function that I call in my view controllers. You need to do it either in viewDidLoad or any point after that.In some cases the navigation item may already exist, in other cases it needs to be created. This accounts for both of those cases without messing with the navigation item title. It allows you to remove the title by simply passing in @"".I applied the following code in viewDidLoad and it works:Just to update I use Vector IconYou can subclass UINavigationController, set itself as the delegate, and set the backBarButtonItem in the delegate method navigationController:willShowViewController:animated:If you have two ViewController(FirstVC, SecondVC) Embed in Navigation Controller, and you want there is only back arrow in SecondVC.You can try this\nIn FirstVC\'s ViewDidLoadThen when you push into SecondVC, you\'ll see the there is only back arrowIf you set the tintColor Of NavigationBar,add a custom back button image without title that tint color will reflect the image color.

You\'ll know you succeeded when you see "Bar Button Item - " under the "Navigation Item".  That\'s in the Document Outline (Editor->Show Document Outline). Once you see the above picture, you can delete a few spaces and see if it still works.Just like Kyle Begeman does, you add the code above at your root view controller. All the sub view controller will be applied. Additionally, adding this in initWithCoder: method, you can apply the style for root view controllers in xib, storyboard or code based approaches.The only way that worked for me was:UPDATE: When I changed the segue animation flag to true (It was false before), the only way that worked for me was: You may place that category in AppDelegate.m file.\nto removes text from all default back buttons in UINavigation. Only the arrow "<" or set custom image if you need.Objective-c:...@endThis works a treat for both iOS6 and 7Xamarin(C#) optionsObjective-C option [[UIBarButtonItem appearance] setBackButtonTitlePositionAdjustment:UIOffsetMake(-1000, -1000) forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault];
