I was able to clone a copy of this repo over HTTPS authenticated. I\'ve made some commits and want to push back out to the GitHub server. Using Cygwin on Windows 7 x64.Also set it up with verbose mode. I\'m still pretty baffled.These are the versions of git and curl that I have:I just got the same problem and just figured out what\'s cause.Github seems only supports ssh way to read&write the repo, although https way also displayed \'Read&Write\'.So you need to change your repo config on your PC to ssh way:To definitely be able to login using https protocol, you should first set your authentication credential to the git Remote URI:Then you\'ll be asked for a password when trying to git push.In fact, this is on the http authentication format. You could set a password too:You should be aware that if you do this, your github password will be stored in plaintext in your .git directory, which is obviously undesirable.One small addition to Sean\'s answer.Instead of editing .git/config file manually, you can use git remote set-url command.In your case it should be:I find it easier and cleaner, than messing around with dot-files.Edit .git/config file under your repo directoryFind url= entry under section [remote "origin"]Change it from url=https://github.com/rootux/ms-Dropdown.git to \nhttps://USERNAME@github.com/rootux/ms-Dropdown.gitwhere USERNAME is your github user nameThe other answers that suggest switching to SSH sort of miss the point. HTTPS is supported, but you must log in with you GITHUB password, not your SSH passphrase (which was what was giving me the same exact error). I was having the same problem, but making sure to use my actual GitHub password at the terminal password prompt fixed the solution with no alteration to the config, or resorting to SSH.The reason it is important to note this, is many public institutions (such as my school) will block SSH, but allow HTTPS (which is the only reason I started cloning over HTTPS in the first place).Hope that helps anyone else having the same issue...I think @deepwaters got the answer correct for older versions. The HTTPS URL needs to have the username. I had git 1.7.0.4 and git push origin master wouldn\'t even ask for a password till I added it.Upgrade your git. GitHub has answered this question at https://help.github.com/articles/error-the-requested-url-returned-error-403.This works for me -:Hope it helpsSame error and resolution on Mac OS X.Everything was working fine till I created a new account on GitHub and tried to pushAnd got the error:remote: Permission to NEWUSER/NEWREPO.git denied to OLDUSER. fatal: unable to access \xe2\x80\x98https://github.com/NEWUSER/NEWREPO.git/\': The requested URL returned error: 403It should have fixed by setting the user.name either for global or current repoBut it didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I got it fixed by deleting the OLDUSER associated with GitHub from Keychain Access app under Passwords section. Then the push command went successful.referenceFigured it out. I cloned over HTTPS. Setting up my public SSH keys, cloning over SSH, and pushing over SSH fixed it.I actually had a very simple fix to this. All i did was edit the git config file differently after cloning the repository.  The remote origin url is what you need to edit in your default config file. It should look like seen belowA 403 code is "Forbidden".  The server saw your request and refused it.  Do you have permission to push to that repository?Just add you username into url like this :\nhttps://islam9@github.com/islam9/bootstrap-rtlplease check:\nhttp://islamkhalil.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/github-error-pushing-to-git-returning-error-code-403-fatal/After this our "Push to Git" worked fine.I faced the same error and the cause was stupid - I did not have privileges to commit to selected repository. I did not know that I have to as described in https://help.github.com/categories/63/articlesWhat worked for me:My repo was a fork and still linked to the the parents repo.Will tell you if it is your repo or not.Allows you to reconfigure it to your repo and then allow you to push.For anyone curious, my mac machine vs lucid vm ran git 1.7.6 vs 1.7.0.4, and the exact same repo was pushable from my mac (newer git) but not the VMSame curl version.

Do not forget the "git" before the "@".I figured out my own variation of this problem.The issue was not changing the protocol from https to ssl, but instead,\nsetting the Github global username and email! (I was trying to push to a \nprivate repository.Add the user name as part of the URL and This error happens because the git command is hitting http instead of https. So set the urlAfter which you will be prompted for password: I had this problem right now, and it turned out that my server /etc/resolver.conf file had a bad ip address.  Might help others.This happened to me because my coworker accidentially disabled the repository that this repository was forked from. Just might check to ensure that the original git(hub) repo actually still exists.It could be an accounting issue. The Github account of the upstream (private) repo owner may not be financial. I\'ve seen this where the client\'s credit card expired.I had the same issue. My case was: I\'d initialized git repo locally before I created it on github, then I tried to add remote branch. I solved my issue by changing the order of actions: created a repo on github site, then inited it locally. But it\'s not the case fr them who like to do all from command line as me.After changing https to http within gitbox app, it worked for me. Sometimes there is nothing wrong with settings, and there are some problems on github servers.https://status.github.com - current status of github :)Github has page dedicated to troubleshooting this error:https://help.github.com/articles/https-cloning-errorsIn my case it turned out that using a new version of git (1.8.5.2) solved this problem.Edit .git/config file under your repo directoryFind url= entry under section [remote "origin"]Change it from url=https://github.com/rootux/ms-Dropdown.git to https://USERNAME@github.com/rootux/ms-Dropdown.gitwhere USERNAME is your github user name=> This solution worked for me.For those having permission denied 403 error while using ssh(according to Xiao) or http urls\ntry these commands with administrator rights One another possible reason is, you might have exceeded their plan limit.To fix this issue and restore write access to the repo, either your account plan will need to be upgraded, or some of your collaborators will need to be removed.
