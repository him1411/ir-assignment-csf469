I am running this query on MySQLand it is giving this error:Every derived table must have its own alias. What is wrong ?Every derived table (AKA sub-query) must indeed have an alias. I.e. each query in brackets must be given an alias (AS whatever), which can the be used to refer to it in the rest of the outer query.In your case, of course, the entire query could be replaced with:I think it\'s asking you to do this: But why would you write this query in the first place?Here\'s a different example that can\'t be rewritten without aliases ( can\'t GROUP BY DISTINCT).Imagine a table called purchases that records purchases made by customers at stores, i.e. it\'s a many to many table and the software needs to know which customers have made purchases at more than one store:..will break with the error Every derived table must have its own alias.  To fix:( Note the AS custom alias).
