I have a DataFrame:Then I just want the records whose EPS is not NaN, that is, df.drop(....) will return the dataframe as below:How do I do that?Don\'t drop. Just take rows where EPS is finite:This question is already resolved, but... ...also consider the solution suggested by Wouter in his original comment. The ability to handle missing data, including dropna(), is built into pandas explicitly. Aside from potentially improved performance over doing it manually, these functions also come with a variety of options which may be useful. There are also other options (See docs at http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html), including dropping columns instead of rows. Pretty handy! I know this has already been answered, but just for the sake of a purely pandas solution to this specific question as opposed to the general description from Aman (which was wonderful) and in case anyone else happens upon this:You could use dataframe method notnull or inverse of isnull, or numpy.isnan:You can use this:yet another solution which uses the fact that np.nan != np.nan:It  may be added at that \'&\' can be used to add additional conditions e.g.Notice that when evaluating the statements, pandas needs parenthesis.For some reason none of the previously submitted answers worked for me. This basic solution did:Though of course that will drop rows with negative numbers, too. So if you want those it\'s probably smart to add this after, too.
