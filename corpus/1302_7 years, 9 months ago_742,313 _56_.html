I have many rows in a database that contains xml and I\'m trying to write a Python script that will go through those rows and count how many instances of a particular node attribute show up. For instance, my tree looks like:How can I access the attributes 1 and 2 in the XML using Python?I suggest ElementTree.  There are other compatible implementations of the same API, such as lxml, and cElementTree in the Python standard library itself; but, in this context, what they chiefly add is even more speed -- the ease of programming part depends on the API, which ElementTree defines.After building an Element instance e from the XML, e.g. with the XML function, or by parsing a file with something likeor any of the many other ways shown at ElementTree, you just do something like:and similar, usually pretty simple, code patterns.minidom is the quickest and pretty straight forward:XML:PYTHON:OUTPUTYou can use BeautifulSoupThere are many options out there. cElementTree looks excellent if speed and memory usage are an issue. It has very little overhead compared to simply reading in the file using readlines.The relevant metrics can be found in the table below, copied from the cElementTree website:As pointed out by @j-f-sebastian, cElementTree comes bundled with python: "On Python 2: from xml.etree import cElementTree as ElementTree. On Python 3: from xml.etree import ElementTree (the accelerated C version is used automatically)."lxml.objectify is really simple.Taking your sample text:Output:I suggest xmltodict for simplicity.It parses your xml to an OrderedDict;Python has an interface to the expat xml parser.It\'s a non-validating parser, so bad xml will not be caught. But if you know your file is correct, then this is pretty good, and you\'ll probably get the exact info you want and you can discard the rest on the fly.I\'m still a Python newbie myself, but my impression is that ElementTree is the state-of-the-art in Python XML parsing and handling.Mark Pilgrim has a good section on Parsing XML with ElementTree in his book Dive Into Python 3.Here a very simple but effective code using cElementTree. Source:http://www.snip2code.com/Snippet/991/python-xml-parse?fromPage=1I find the Python xml.dom and xml.dom.minidom quite easy. Keep in mind that DOM isn\'t good for large amounts of XML, but if your input is fairly small then this will work fine.Just to add another possibility, you can use untangle, as it is a simple xml-to-python-object library. Here you have an example:InstallationUsageYour xml file (a little bit changed):accessing the attributes with untangle:the output will be:More information about untangle can be found here.Also (if you are curious), you can find a list of tools for working with XML and Python here (you will also see that the most common ones were mentioned by previous answers).This will print the value of foobar attribute.Are you serious ?What about security concerns ? Use defusedxml .This is also recommended by Two Scoops of Django .Comparison about defusedxml vs other librariesLxml is protected against billion laughs attacks and doesn\'t do\n  network lookups by default.libxml2 and lxml are not directly vulnerable to gzip decompression\n  bombs but they don\'t protect you against them either.xml.etree doesn\'t expand entities and raises a ParserError when an\n  entity occurs.minidom doesn\'t expand entities and simply returns the unexpanded\n  entity verbatim.genshi.input of genshi 0.6 doesn\'t support entity expansion and raises\n  a ParserError when an entity occurs.Library has (limited) XInclude support but requires an additional step\n  to process inclusion.I might suggest declxml.Full disclosure: I wrote this library because I was looking for a way to convert between XML and Python data structures without needing to write dozens of lines of imperative parsing/serialization code with ElementTree.With declxml, you use processors to declaratively define the structure of your XML document and how to map between XML and Python data structures. Processors are used to for both serialization and parsing as well as for a basic level of validation.Parsing into Python data structures is straightforward:Which produces the output:You can also use the same processor to serialize data to XMLWhich produces the following outputIf you want to work with objects instead of dictionaries, you can define processors to transform data to and from objects as well.Which produces the following outputrec.xml:-par.py:-
