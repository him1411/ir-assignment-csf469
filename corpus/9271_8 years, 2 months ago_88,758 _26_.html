Is there a way to show the SQL that Django is running while performing a query?See the docs FAQ: "How can I see the raw SQL queries Django is running?"django.db.connection.queries contains a list of the SQL queries:Querysets also have a query attribute containing the query to be executed:Note that the output of the query is not valid SQL, because:"Django never actually interpolates the parameters: it sends the query and the parameters separately to the database adapter, which performs the appropriate operations."From Django bug report #17741.Because of that, you should not send query output directly to a database.Take a look at debug_toolbar, it\'s very useful for debugging.Documentation and source is available at http://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/.Django-extensions have a command shell_plus with a parameter print-sqlIn django-shell all executed queries will be printedEx.:Though you can do it with with the code supplied, I find that using the debug toolbar app is a great tool to show queries. You can download it from github here.This gives you the option to show all the queries ran on a given page along with the time to query took. It also sums up the number of queries on a page along with total time for a quick review. This is a great tool, when you want to look at what the Django ORM does behind the scenes. It also have a lot of other nice features, that you can use if you like.No other answer covers this method, so:I find by far the most useful, simple, and reliable method is to ask your database.  For example on Linux for Postgres you might do:Each database will have slightly different procedure.  In the database logs you\'ll see not only the raw SQL, but any connection setup or transaction overhead django is placing on the system.If you make sure your settings.py file has:Then you should have access to the sql_queries variable.  I append a footer to each page that looks like this:I got the variable sql_time_sum by adding the line to the debug function in django_src/django/core/context_processors.py.Another option, see logging options in settings.py described by this posthttp://dabapps.com/blog/logging-sql-queries-django-13/debug_toolbar slows down each page load on your dev server, logging does not so it\'s faster. Outputs can be dumped to console or file, so the UI is not as nice. But for views with lots of SQLs, it can take a long time to debug and optimize the SQLs through debug_toolbar since each page load is so slow.
