I\'ve the enum type ReportTypeEnum that get passed between methods in all my classes but I then need to pass this on the URL so I use the ordinal method to get the int value. After I get it in my other JSP page, I need to convert it to back to an ReportTypeEnum so that I can continue passing it. How can I convert ordinal to the ReportTypeEnum?Using Java 6 SE.To convert an ordinal into its enum represantation you might want to do this:Please notice the array bounds.                    Note that every call to values() returns a newly cloned array which might impact performance in a negative way. You may want to cache the array if it\'s going to be called often. Code example on how to cache values().This answer was edited to include the feedback given inside the commentsThis is almost certainly a bad idea. Certainly if the ordinal is de-facto persisted (e.g. because someone has bookmarked the URL) - it means that you must always preserve the enum ordering in future, which may not be obvious to code maintainers down the line.Why not encode the enum using myEnumValue.name() (and decode via ReportTypeEnum.valueOf(s)) instead?If I\'m going to be using values() a lot:Meanwhile wherever.java:Mind your array bounds.You could use a static lookup table:I agree with most people that using ordinal is probably a bad idea.  I usually solve this problem by giving the enum a private constructor that can take for example a DB value then create a static fromDbValue function similar to the one in Jan\'s answer.Now you can change the order without changing the lookup and vice versa.This is what I use. I make no pretense that it\'s far less "efficient" than the simpler solutions above. What it does do is provide a much clearer exception message than "ArrayIndexOutOfBounds" when an invalid ordinal value is used in the solution above.It utilizes the fact that EnumSet javadoc specifies the iterator returns elements in their natural order. There\'s an assert if that\'s not correct.The JUnit4 Test demonstrates how it\'s used.the test classI appreciate that you share with us if you have a more efficient code, My enum is huge and constantly called thousands of times.Every enum has name(), which gives a string with the name of enum member.Given enum Suit{Heart, Spade, Club, Diamond}, Suit.Heart.name() will give Heart.Every enum has a valueOf() method, which takes an enum type and a string, to perform the reverse operation:Enum.valueOf(Suit.class, "Heart") returns Suit.Heart.Why anyone would use ordinals is beyond me. It may be nanoseconds faster, but it is not safe, if the enum members change, as another developer may not be aware some code is relying on ordinal values (especially in the JSP page cited in the question, network and database overhead completely dominates the time, not using an integer over a string).
