I have this script called test.sh:when I run sh test.sh I get this:What am I doing wrong?  I look at extremely basic/beginners bash scripting tutorials online and this is how they say to declare variables... So I\'m not sure what I\'m doing wrong.I\'m on Ubuntu Server 9.10. And yes, bash is located at /bin/bash.You cannot have spaces around your \'=\' sign.  When you write:bash tries to run a command named STR with 2 arguments (the strings \'=\' and \'foo\')When you write:bash tries to run a command named STR with 1 argument (the string \'=foo\')When you write:bash tries to run the command foo with STR set to the empty string in its environment.I\'m not sure if this helps to clarify or if it is mere obfuscation, but note that:The relevant section of the sh language spec, section 2.9.1 states:A "simple command" is a sequence of optional variable assignments and redirections, in any sequence, optionally followed by words and redirections, terminated by a control operator.In that context, a word is the command that bash is going to run.  Any string  containing = (in any position other than at the beginning of the string) which is not a redirection is a variable assignment, while any string that is not a redirection and does not contain = is a command.  In STR = "foo", STR is not a variable assignment.Drop the spaces around the = sign:In the interactive mode everything looks fine Obviously ! as Johannes said, no space around \'=\'. In case there is any space around \'=\' then in the interactive mode it gives errors as `No command \'str\' foundWhen you define any variable then you do not have to put in any extra spaces.E.g.So remove spaces:and it will work fine.
