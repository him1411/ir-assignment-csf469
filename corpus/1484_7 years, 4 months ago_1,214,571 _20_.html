How do I comment out a block of tags in XML?I.e. How can I comment out <staticText> and everything inside it, in the code below?I could use <!-- staticText--> but that\'s just for single tags (as what I know), like // in Java and C. I would like something more like how /** comment **/ can be used in Java and C, so I can comment out longer blocks of XML code.You can use that style of comment across multiple lines (which exists also in HTML)If you ask, because you got errors with the <!-- --> syntax, it\'s most likely the CDATA section (and there the ]]> part), that then lies in the middle of the comment. It should not make a difference, but ideal and real world can be quite a bit apart, sometimes (especially when it comes to XML processing).Try to change the ]]>, too:Another thing, that comes to mind: If the content of your XML somewhere contains two hyphens, the comment immediately ends there:That\'s quite a common pitfall. It\'s inherited from the way SGML handles comments. (Read the XML spec on this topic)You can wrap the text with a non-existing processing-instruction, e.g.:Nested processing instructions are not allowed and \'?>\' ends the processing instruction (see http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-pi)Actually, you can use the <!--...--> format with multi-lines or tags:Here for commenting we have to write like below:Shortcut for Commenting a single line:Ctrl + /Shortcut for Commenting multiple lines:Ctrl + Shift + /One thing you have to keep in mind that, you can\'t comment an attribute of an XML tag. For Example:Here, TextView is a XML Tag and text is an attribute of that tag. You can\'t comment attributes of an XML Tag. You have to comment the full XML Tag.You can easily comment out the data using this:method of commenting in xml.
