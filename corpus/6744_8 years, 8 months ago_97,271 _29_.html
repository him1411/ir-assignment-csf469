I\'m writing an iPhone app.  It\'s already been published, but I would like to add a feature where its version number is displayed.I\'d rather not have to do this manually with each version I release... Is there a way in objective-C to find out what the version is of my app?As I describe here, I use a script to rewrite a header file with my current Subversion revision number.  That revision number is stored in the kRevisionNumber constant.  I can then access the version and revision number using something similar to the following:which will create a string of the format "Version 1.0 (51)".Building on Brad Larson\'s answer, if you have major and minor version info stored in the info plist (as I did on a particular project), this worked well for me:Now revving a minor version manually can be a pain, and so using a source repository revision number trick is ideal. If you\'ve not tied that in (as I hadn\'t), the above snippet can be useful. It also pulls out the app\'s display name.This is what I did in my applicationHopefully this simple answer will help somebody...Swift version for both separately:Swift 3Swift 2Its included in this repo, check it out:https://github.com/goktugyil/EZSwiftExtensionsYou can specify the CFBundleShortVersionString string in your plist.info and read that programmatically using the provided API.There are two things - build version and app version.To get App version:To get Build version:A succinct way to obtain a version string in X.Y.Z format is:Or, for just X.Y:Both of these snippets returns strings that you would assign to your label object\'s text property, e.g.You can try using dictionary as:-Read the info.plist file of your app and get the value for key CFBundleShortVersionString. Reading info.plist will give you an NSDictionary objectIf you need a combination of both version and build num, here\'s a short way using Swift 3:Add an as! String to the end of either the appVersion or buildNum line to get only that portion as a String object. No need for that though if you\'re looking for the full versionInfo.I hope this helps!This is a good thing to handle with a revision control system. That way when you get a bug report from a user, you can check out that revision of code and (hopefully) reproduce the bug running the exact same code as the user. The idea is that every time you do a build, you will run a script that gets the current revision number of your code and updates a file within your project (usually with some form of token replacement). You can then write an error handling routine that always includes the revision number in the error output, or you can display it on an "About" page.You can use the infoDictionary which gets the version details from info.plist of you app. This code works for swift 3. Just call this method and display the version in any preferred UI element.
