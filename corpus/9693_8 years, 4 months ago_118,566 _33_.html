How can I simply scan barcodes on iPhone and/or iPad?We produced the \'Barcodes\' application for the iPhone. It can decode QR Codes. The source code is available from the zxing project; specifically, you want to take a look at the iPhone client and the partial C++ port of the core library. The port is a little old, from circa the 0.9 release of the Java code, but should still work reasonably well.If you need to scan other formats, like 1D formats, you could continue the port of the Java code within this project to C++.EDIT: Barcodes and the iphone code in the project were retired around the start of 2014.Check out ZBar reads QR Code and ECN/ISBN codes and is available as under the LGPL v2 license.As with the release of iOS7 you no longer need to use an external framework or library. The iOS ecosystem with AVFoundation now fully supports scanning almost every code from QR over EAN to UPC.Just have a look at the Tech Note and the AVFoundation programming guide. AVMetadataObjectTypeQRCode is your friend.Here is a nice tutorial which shows it step by step:\niPhone QR code scan library iOS7Just a little example on how to set it up:The iPhone 4 camera is more than capabale of doing barcodes.\nThe zebra crossing barcode library has a fork on github zxing-iphone. It\'s open-source.liteqr is a "Lite QR Reader in Objective C ported from zxing" on github and has support for Xcode 4.There are two major libraries:ZXing a library written in Java and then ported to Objective C / C++ (QR code only). And an other port to ObjC has been done, by TheLevelUp: ZXingObjCZBar an open source software for reading bar codes, C based.According to my experiments, ZBar is far more accurate and fast than ZXing, at least on iPhone.HOWTO: Add a barcode reader to an iPhone app, that points to ZBar iPhone SDK, looks helpful (from another thread).Not sure if this will help but here is a link to an open source QR Code library. As you can see a couple of people have already used this to create apps for the iphone.Wikipedia has an article explaining what QR Codes are. In my opinion QR Codes are much more fit for purpose than the standard barcode where the iphone is concerned as it was designed for this type of implementation.If support for the iPad 2 or iPod Touch is important for your application, I\'d choose a barcode scanner SDK that can decode barcodes in blurry images, such as our Scandit barcode scanner SDK for iOS and Android. Decoding blurry barcode images is also helpful on phones with autofocus cameras because the user does not have to wait for the autofocus to kick in. Scandit comes with a free community price plan and also has a product API that makes it easy to convert barcode numbers into product names. (Disclaimer: I\'m a co-founder of Scandit)You could take a look at Stefan Hafeneger\'s iPhone DataMatrix Reader Source Code (Google Code project; archived blog post) if it\'s still available.There\'s another option for this now if you are open to licensing an SDK.  Check out the RedLaser SDK that works for UPCA/EAN13 with or without autofocus.  Recently updated.I\'m a founder of the computer vision startup that built this new scanner, just FYI.The problem with iPhone camera is that the first models (of which there are tons in use) have a fixed-focus camera that cannot take picture in-focus for distances under 2ft. The images are blurry and distorted and if taken from greater distance there is not enough detail/information from the barcode.A few companies have developed iPhone apps that can accomodate for that by using advanced de-blurring technologies. Those applications you can find on Apple app store: pic2shop, RedLaser and ShopSavvy. All of the companies have announced that they have also SDKs available - some for free or very preferential terms, check that one out.For a native iOS 7 bar code scanner take a look at my project on GitHub:   https://github.com/werner77/WECodeScannerHere is simple code:Sometimes it can be useful also to generate QR codes. There is a superb C library for this which works like a charm. It is called libqrencode. Writing a custom view for displaying the QR code then is not that difficult and can be done with a basic understanding of QuartzCore.you can check  ZBarSDK  to reads QR Code and ECN/ISBN codes it\'s simple to integrate try the following code.and in didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo we get bar code value.I believe this can be done using AVFramework, here is the sample code to do this
