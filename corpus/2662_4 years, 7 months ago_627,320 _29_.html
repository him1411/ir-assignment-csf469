I have an array of products that I\'m repeating over using ng-repeat and am using to filter these products by colour. The filter is working but if the product name / description etc contains the colour then the product remains after the filter is applied.How do I set the filter to only apply to the colour field of my array rather than every field?See the example on the filter page.  Use an object, and set the color in the color property:Specify the property (i.e. colour) where you want the filter to be applied:You can filter by an object with a property matching the objects you have to filter on it:This can of course be passed in by variable, as Mark Rajcok suggested.If you want to filter on a grandchild (or deeper) of the given object, you can continue to build out your object hierarchy. For example, if you want to filter on \'thing.properties.title\', you can do the following:You can also filter on multiple properties of an object just by adding them to your filter object:Best way to do this is to use a function:htmljavascriptAlternatively, you can use ngHide or ngShow to dynamically show and hide elements based on a certain criteria.Be careful with angular filter. If you want select specific value in field, you can\'t use filter.Example:javascripthtmlThis will select both, because use something like substr That means you want select product where "color" contains string "blue" and not where "color" is "blue".If you were to do the following:...you would not only get items of itemTypeId 2 and itemStatus 1, but you would also get items with itemType 20, 22, 202, 123 and itemStatus 10, 11, 101, 123.  This is because the filter: {...} syntax works like a string contains query.However, if you were to add the : true condition, it would do filter by exact match:Search by color: you can do an inner nest too.filter:{prop1:{innerprop1:searchinput}}my way is thissub is a Input field or whatever you likeDisplaying like thisYou must use\n filter:{color_name:by_colour} instead ofIf you want to match with a single property of an object, then write that property instead of object, otherwise some other property will get match.
