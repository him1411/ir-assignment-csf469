list.append() is the obvious choice for adding to the end of a list.  Here\'s a reasonable explanation for the missing list.prepend().  Assuming my list is short and performance concerns are negligible, is or idiomatic?The s.insert(0, x) form is the most common.Whenever you see it though, it may be time to consider using a collections.deque instead of a list.If you can go the functional way, the following is pretty clearOf course you haven\'t inserted x into your_list, rather you have created a new list with x preprended to it.If someone finds this question like me, here are my performance tests of proposed methods:As you can see, insert and slice assignment are as almost twice as fast than explicit adding and are very close in results. As Raymond Hettinger noted insert is more common option and I, personally prefer this way to prepend to list.What\'s the idiomatic syntax for prepending to a short python list?The list.insert can be used this way.But this is inefficient, because in Python, a list is an array of pointers, and Python must now take every pointer in the list and move it down one to insert the pointer to your object in the first slot, so this is really only efficient for rather short lists, as you ask.As Raymond said, consider a collections.deque, which has many of the methods of a list, but also has an appendleft method (as well as popleft). The deque is a double-ended queue - no matter the length, it always takes the same amount of time to preprend something. In big O notation, O(1) versus the O(n) time for lists. Here\'s the usage:and performance:The list operations all perform similarly, and the deque is about twice as fast. As the lists get longer, I would expect a deque to perform even better.The first one is certainly a lot clearer and expresses the intent much better: you only want to insert a single element, not a whole list.
