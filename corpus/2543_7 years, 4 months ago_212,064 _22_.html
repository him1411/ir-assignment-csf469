I need to check if an dict has a key or not. How?objectForKey will return nil if a key doesn\'t exist.orMore recent versions of Objective-C and Clang have a modern syntax for this:You do not have to check for equality with nil, because only non-nil Objective-C objects can be stored in dictionaries(or arrays). And all Objective-C objects are truthy values. Even @NO, @0, and [NSNull null] evaluate as true. Edit: Swift is now a thing. For Swift you would try something like the followingThis syntax will only execute the if block if myKey is in the dict and if it is then the value is stored in the value variable. Note that this works for even falsey values like 0.I like Fernandes\' answer even though you ask for the obj twice. This should also do (more or less the same as Martin\'s A).Martin\'s and this answer both work on iPad2 iOS 5.0.1 9A405When using JSON dictionaries:One very nasty gotcha which just wasted a bit of my time debugging - you may find yourself prompted by auto-complete to try using doesContain which seems to work.Except, doesContain uses an id comparison instead of the hash comparison used by objectForKey so if you have a dictionary with string keys it will return NO to a doesContain.Using Swift, it would be:Yes. This kind of errors are very common and lead to app crash. So I use to add NSDictionary in each project as below://.h file code ://.m file code is as belowIn code you can use as below:For checking existence of key in NSDictionary:  Because nil cannot be stored in Foundation data structures NSNull is sometimes to represent a nil. Because NSNull is a singleton object you can check to see if NSNull is the value stored in dictionary by using direct pointer comparison:I\'d suggest you store the result of the lookup in a temp variable, test if the temp variable is nil and then use it. That way you don\'t look the same object up twice:
