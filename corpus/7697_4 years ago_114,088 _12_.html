I am trying to figure out how I can hide the overflow-y:scroll; if not needed. What I mean is that I am building a website and I have a main area which posts will be displayed and I want to hide the scroll bar if content does not exceed the current width.Also, my second question. I want to make it so when the posts exceed the current width, the width will increase automatically and the content won\'t go out of the box.Does anyone have a clue how to do this?Posts area:Main website container:Set overflow-y property to auto, or remove the property altogether if it is not inherited.Here is a working example of both the problems solved.You can use overflow:auto;You can also control the x or y axis individually with the overflow-x and overflow-y properties.Example:You can use both .content and .container to overflow:auto. Means if it\'s text is exceed automatically scroll will come x-axis and y-axis. (no need to give separete x-axis and y-axis commonly give overflow:auto).content {overflow:auto;}
