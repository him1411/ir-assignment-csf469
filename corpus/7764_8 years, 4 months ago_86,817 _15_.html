I\'m handling the dblclick event on a span in my web app. A side-effect is that the double click selects text on the page. How can I prevent this selection from happening?You can also apply these styles to the span for all non-IE browsers and IE10:In plain javascript:Or with jQuery:A simple Javascript function that makes the content inside a page-element unselectable:or, on mozilla: On IE,To prevent text selection ONLY after a double click:You could use MouseEvent#detail property.\nFor mousedown or mouseup events, it is 1 plus the current click count.See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UIEvent/detailTo prevent IE 8 CTRL and SHIFT click text selection on individual elementTo prevent text selection on documentOld thread, but I came up with a solution that I believe is cleaner since it does not disable every even bound to the object, and only prevent random and unwanted text selections on the page. It is straightforward, and works well for me. \nHere is an example; I want to prevent text-selection when I click several time on the object with the class "arrow-right": HTH !I had the same problem. I solved it by switching to <a> and add onclick="return false;" (so that clicking on it won\'t add a new entry to browser history).
