I have designed my custom Cell in IB, subclassed it and connected my outlets to my custom class. I have three subviews in cell content which are: UIView (cdView) and two labels (titleLabel and emailLabel). Depending on data available for each row, sometimes I want to have UIView and two labels displayed in my cell and sometimes only two labels. What I am trying to do is to set constraints that way if I set UIView property to hidden or I will remove it from superview the two labels will move to the left. I tried to set UIView leading constraint to Superview (Cell content) for 10px and UILabels leading Constraints for 10 px to the next view (UIView). Later in my code I am hiding my cell.cdView and I would like the labels to move to the left however they are staying in the same position in Cell. I tried to remove cell.cdView from superview but it didn\'t work either. I have attached image to clarify what I am about.I know how to do this programatically and I am not looking for that solution. What I want is to set constraints in IB and I expect that my subviews will move dynamically if other views are removed or hidden. Is it possible to do this in IB with auto-layout?It is possible, but you\'ll have to do a little extra work. There are a couple conceptual things to get out of the way first:In your case, this likely means:What you need to do is judiciously over-constrain your labels. Leave your existing constraints (10pts space to the other view) alone, but add another constraint: make your labels\' left edges 10pts away from their superview\'s left edge with a non-required priority (the default high priority will probably work well).Then, when you want them to move left, remove the left view altogether. The mandatory 10pt constraint to the left view will disappear along with the view it relates to, and you\'ll be left with just a high-priority constraint that the labels be 10pts away from their superview. On the next layout pass, this should cause them to expand left until they fill the width of the superview but for your spacing around the edges.One important caveat: if you ever want your left view back in the picture, not only do you have to add it back into the view hierarchy, but you also have to reestablish all its constraints at the same time. This means you need a way to put your 10pt spacing constraint between the view and its labels back whenever that view is shown again.Adding or removing constraints during runtime is a heavyweight operation that can affect performance. However, there is a simpler alternative.For the view you wish to hide, set up a width constraint. Constrain the other views with a leading horizontal gap to that view.To hide, update the .constant of the width constraint to 0.f. The other views will automatically move left to assume position.See my other answer here for more details:How to change label constraints during runtime?For those who support iOS 8+ only, there is a new boolean property active. It will help to enable only needed constraints dynamicallyP.S. Constraint outlet should be strong, not weakUIStackView repositions its views automatically when the hidden property is changed on any of its subviews (iOS 9+). Jump to 11:48 in this WWDC video for a demo:Mysteries of Auto Layout, Part 1My project uses a custom @IBDesignable subclass of UILabel (to ensure consistency in colour, font, insets etc.) and I have implemented something like the following:This allows the label subclass to take part in Auto Layout, but take no space when hidden.For the Googlers: building on Max\'s answer, to solve the padding issue that many have noticed I simply increased the height of the label and used that height as the separator instead of actual padding. This idea could be expanded for any scenario with containing views.Here\'s a simple example:In this case, I map the height of the Author label to an appropriate IBOutlet:and when I set the height of the constraint to 0.0f, we preserve the "padding", because the Play button\'s height allows for it.connect constraint between uiview and labels as IBOutlet and set priority member to a less value when set hidden = YESWhat I ended up doing was creating 2 xibs. One with the left view and one without it. I registered both in the controller and then decided which to use during cellForRowAtIndexPath.They use the same UITableViewCell class. The downside is that there is some duplication of the content between the xibs, but these cells are pretty basic. The upside is that I don\'t have a bunch of code to manually manage removing view, updating constraints, etc.In general, this is probably a better solution since they are technically different layouts and therefore should have different xibs.In this case, I map the height of the Author label to an appropriate IBOutlet:and when I set the height of the constraint to 0.0f, we preserve the "padding", because the Play button\'s height allows for it.\nUse two UIStackView Horizontal and Vertical, when some subview view in stack is hidden other stack subviews will be moved, use Distribution -> Fill Proporionally for Vertical stack with two UILabels and need set width and height constaints for first UIViewAs no_scene suggested, you can definitely do this by changing the priority of the constraint at runtime. This was much easier for me because I had more than one blocking view which would have to be removed.Here\'s a snippet using ReactiveCocoa:In my case I set the constant of the height constraint to 0.0f and also set the hidden property to YES.To show the view (with the subviews) again I did the opposite: I set the height constant to a non-zero value and set the hidden property to NO.In case this helps someone, I built a helper class for using visual format constraints. I\'m using it in my current app.AutolayoutHelperIt might be a bit tailored to my needs, but you might find it useful or you might want to modify it and create your own helper.I have to thank Tim for his answer above, this answer about UIScrollView and also this tutorial.Here\'s how I would re-align my uiviews to get your solution:I created a thumb rule of my own. Whenever you have to hide / show any uiview whose constraints might be affected, add all the affected / dependent subviews inside a uiview and update its leading / trailing / top / bottom constraint constant programmatically.
