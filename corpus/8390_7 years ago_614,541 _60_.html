I have a directory which hosts all of my Django apps (C:\\My_Projects). I want to add this directory to my pythonpath so I can call the apps directly.I have tried adding C:\\My_Projects\\; to my Path variable from the Windows GUI (My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables). But it still doesn\'t read the coltrane module and generates this error:Error: No module named coltraneYou know what has worked for me really well on windows.My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > Then under system variables I create a new Variable called PythonPath. In this variable I have C:\\Python27\\Lib;C:\\Python27\\DLLs;C:\\Python27\\Lib\\lib-tk;C:\\other-folders-on-the-pathThis is the best way that has worked for me which I hadn\'t found in any of the docs offered.EDIT: For those who are not able to get it,\nPlease add C:\\Python27;along with it. Else it will never work.Windows 7 Professional\nI Modified @mongoose_za\'s answer to make it easier to change the python version:Add the following to the existing variable:%PY_HOME%;%PY_HOME%\\Lib;%PY_HOME%\\DLLs;%PY_HOME%\\Lib\\lib-tk;\nClick [OK] to close all of the windows. As a final sanity check open a command prompt and enter python. You should see If you need to switch between versions, you only need to modify the PY_HOME variable to point to the proper directory. This is bit easier to manage if you need multiple python versions installed. Just append your installation path (ex. C:\\Python27\\) to the PATH variable in System variables. Then close and open your command line and type \'python\'.These solutions work, but they work for your code ONLY on your machine. I would add a couple of lines to your code that look like this:That should take care of your problemsFrom Windows command line:To set the PYTHONPATH permanently, add the line to your autoexec.bat. Alternatively, if you edit the system variable through the System Properties, it will also be changed permanently.Adding Python and PythonPath to the Windows environment:Under \'System Variables\':AddPY_HOMEPYTHONPATHAppendpathThe easier way to set the path in python is : \nclick start> My Computer >Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables >\nsecond windows > select Path > Edit > and then add ";C:\\Python27\\;C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\"link :http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/You need to add to your PYTHONPATH variable instead of Windows PATH variable.http://docs.python.org/using/windows.htmlYou can also add a .pth file containing the desired directory in either your c:\\PythonX.X folder, or your \\site-packages folder, which tends to be my preferred method when I\'m developing a Python package.See here for more information.To augment PYTHONPATH, run regedit and navigate to KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\n\\SOFTWARE\\Python\\PythonCore and then select the folder for the python\nversion you wish to use. Inside this is a folder labelled PythonPath,\nwith one entry that specifies the paths where the default install\nstores modules. Right-click on PythonPath and choose to create a new\nkey. You may want to name the key after the project whose module\nlocations it will specify; this way, you can easily compartmentalize\nand track your path modifications.thanksIn Python 3.4 on windows it worked when I added it to PATH enviroment variable instead of PYTHONPATH. Like if you have installed Python 3.4 in D:\\Programming\\Python34 then add this at the end of your PATH environment variableClose and reopen command prompt and execute \'python\'. It will open the python shell. This also fixed my Sublime 3 issue of \'python is not recognized as an internal or external command\'.For anyone trying to achieve this with Python 3.3+, the Windows installer now includes an option to add python.exe to the system search path. Read more in the docs.The python 2.X paths can be set from few of the above instructions.\nPython 3 by default will be installed in \nC:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35-32\\\nSo this path has to be added to Path variable in windows environment.This PYTHONPATH variable needs to be set for ArcPY when ArcGIS Desktop is installed. PYTHONPATH=C:\\arcgis\\bin (your ArcGIS home bin)For some reason it never was set when I used the installer on a Windows 7 32-bit system.Maybe a little late, but this is how you add the path to the Windows Environment Variables.Go to the Environment Variables tab, you do this by pressing Windows key + Pausa inter.Go to Advanced System Settings.Click on Environment Variables.On the lower window search for the \'Path\' value.Select itClick on EditIn the end of the line add your instalation folder and the route to \'Scripts\' folder.Click ok, aceptar etc.You\'re done, enter cmd and write python from any location of your drive, it should enter the Python program.Example with my pc (I have Python34)Hope it helps.Greetings from Bogot\xc3\xa1You have to do this only once.
