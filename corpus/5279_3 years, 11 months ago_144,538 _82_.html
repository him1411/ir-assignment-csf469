I\'m running Visual Studio 2013 Pro (RTM version) on my formated PC (Windows 8.1 fresh install).I don\'t know why but Visual Studio 2013 Pro is very very slow! Slow for building, debugging, navigating in the IDE... my HDD led is not lighting up at all!I\'m on a little MFC (C++) project using the Boost library.Any ideas?It is something concerned with the graphics drivers. If you update them you will be fine.Or you can disable the hardware graphics acceleration in Visual Studio according to these steps:In Visual Studio, click "Tools", and then click "Options".In the Options dialog box, navigate to the "Environment > General" section and clear the "Automatically adjust visual experience based on client performance" check box. (Refer to the following screen shot for this step.)Clear the "Use hardware graphics acceleration if available" check box to prevent the use of hardware graphics acceleration.Select or clear the "Enable rich client visual experience" check box to make sure that rich visuals are always on or off, respectively. When this check box is selected, rich visuals are used independent of the computer environment. For example, rich visuals are used when you run Visual Studio locally on a rich client and over remote desktop.References:Try to set Current source control plug-in to None (Tools > Options > Source Control), if you are using Microsoft Git provider, which seems to to slow VS2013 down more and more the larger the repository gets.I had the whole dojo framework under source control using the MS Git provider and it got to the point where there were delays from the time I hit a key to the time the glyph would appear on the screen. That bad. When/if you need git again, you can switch to the tortoise git provider or Git-Extensions, both will work without slowdown. I like Git-Extensions, personally.I too have struggled a bit with bad performance in VS 2013 (Premium). Pretty much the same issues as TS had. Slow navigation, scrolling, building.. just about everything. Luckily I have manage to solve my own problem by disabling Synchronized Settings in VS.\nGo to Tools -> Options -> Environment-Synchronized Settings and remove this option by unchecking the checkbox.Hopefully this will solve your performance issues too!In the case of web applications, another cause of slow building and debugging (but not IDE navigation) could be the Browser Link feature.I found that with this switched on, building would take 4 times longer and debugging was painful - after every postback, web pages would freeze for a few seconds before you could interact with them.I was using a solution upgraded from Visual Studio 2012. Visual Studio 2013 also upgraded the .suo file. Deleting the solution\'s .suo file (it\'s next to the .sln file), closing and re-opening Visual Studio fixed the problem for me. My .suo file went from 91KB to 27KB. I had the same problem and the only solution that worked for me was to follow the 3 steps presented below:Clean the WebSiteCache folder (you may find it at\nC:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WebSiteCache)Clean the "Temporary ASP.NET Files" folder (find it at\nC:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Temporary ASP.NET Files)Restart Visual StudioHope it helps you.What fixed it for me was disabling GIT by setting it to none in Visual Studio, Options, Source  Control.This issue seems to be because of uninstalling the SQL Server Compact edition (4.0).\nI was having this issue and it got fixed after installing the SQL Server Compact edition 4.0.\nOn closing VS 2013 I was getting message to install SQL Server Compact edition as C++ project needed some thing.. can\'t put finger on anything. Resolve this issue by installing Microsoft SQL Server Compact 4.0 Microsoft SQL Server Compact 4.0I can advise an option like this.The "Code Lens" can be disabled like as at the picture. It gives a lot of performance goodness.If you are debugging an ASP.NET website using IE10+, make sure turn off your IE \'LastPass\' password manager plugin. LastPass will bring your debugging sessions to a crawl and significantly reduce your capacity for patience!I submitted a support ticket to Lastpass about this and they acknowledged the issue without any intention to fix it, merely saying: "LastPass is not compatible with Visual Studio 2013".Had the same problem and all the solutions mentioned here didn\'t work out for me.\nAfter uninstalling the "Productivity Power Tools 2013" extension. The performance was back to normal.Hope this will save time for someone.Hey guys there is a good work around for this solution if you are experiencing slowness in rendering the cs files and .cshtml files ,just close all the files opened so that cache gets cleared and open the required files again One more thing to check; for me it was Fusion logging. I\'d turned this on a very long time ago and more or less forgotten about it. Getting rid of the 5000+ directories and 1GB of logged files worked wonders.Visual Studio Community Edition was slow switching between files or opening new files. Everything else (eg menu items) was otherwise normal.I tried all the suggestions above first and none worked. I then noticed it was occuring only on an MVC4 Web Application so I added a new MVC4 Web Application and this was fast.After much trial and error I discovered the difference was packages.config - If i put the Microsoft references at the top of the file this made everything snappy again.Move the Microsoft* entries to the top.It appears you dont need to move them all - moving say <package id="Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure" has an noticeable effect on my machine.as an asideIt appears missing or incomplete nuget packages locally are the cause. I opened the Package manager and got a warning \'Some NuGet packages are missing from this solution\' and choose to Restore them and this sped things up. However I dont like this as in my repo i only add the actual items required for compilation as I dont want to bloat my repo so in the end I just removed the packages.config. this solution may not suit your needs as I prefer to use nuget to fetch the packages, not handle updates to packages so this will break this if you use it for that purposeJust thought I\'d add one more possibility for those who ended up here.  For me, the problem was the Start page -- it was downloading content and causing Visual Studio to hang.  The only solution for me was to:Running unit tests was slow.  It was a ReSharper issue.  I also had issue with slow IDE\nIn my case I installedFollowings helped me a bit\nDisabled synchronization - Tools -> Options -> Environment-Synchronized Settings\nDisabled plug-in selection - Tools -> Studio -> Options -> Source Control.\nDisabled Entity Framework Power Tools Beta 4 - Tools -> Extensions and UpdatesUninstalled JetBrain\'s Resharper - WOW!! I am fast again!!I was also facing this issue for quite long time, below are the steps that I perform and it works for me always:Visual Studio 2013 has a package server running, it was spending up to 2 million K of memory, I put it to low priority and affinity with only one cpu and VS ran much more smoothly.Did anybody found CodeLens (the reference counter) problems with startup performance?Disable CodeLens (tools->options->text editor -> all languages ->code lens) Disable Git Source Control too (tools -> options -> source control)Have you been using ANALYIZE > Performance and Diagnostics?  I have!  It\'s awesome!  But you may want to clean up.Open the Performance Explorer.  If you collapse all of the items in there, select all, then you can right click and do Delete.My solution opens faster and is in general running much faster now.Also you may notice changes to your sln file as shown.  For me, this section was deleted from the sln.In VS 2015 Community edition, I\'ve experienced a very (very) slow IDE after changing the "Environment Font" on "Tools > Options... > Fonts and Colors".Reverting this options back to the default value ("automatic") solved it immediately.I had similar problems when moving from VS2012 -> VS2013.  The IDE would lock up after almost ever click or save, building would take several times longer.  None of the solutions listed here helped.What finally did help was moving my projects to a local drive.  VS2012 had no problems storing my projects on a network share, but VS2013 for some reason couldn\'t handle it.Mike Flynn \'s version did not worked for me. Renaming c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\TeamFoundation\\Team Explorer\\Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Git.Provider.dll worked for me.Change the Fusion Log Value to 0. It solved my issue This is the FusionLog key on registry:Had a VS2013 installed and it was running smoothly. At some point it started to get sluggish and decided to install VS2015. After install nothing changed and both versions were building the solution very slow (around 10 minutes for 18 projects in solution).Then I have started thinking of recently installed extensions - the most recent installed was PHP tools for visual studio (had it on VS2013 only). Not sure how can extension affect other version of VS, but uninstalling it helped me to solve the problem.Hope this will help others to realize that it is not always VS fault.I added "devenv.exe" as an exclusion to Windows Defender. This solved my problem completely. People can try this as their first try.i have some problem, but i just get slowly when try to stop debugging in VS 2013 and i try this:Hope this help.None of the suggestions worked for me but I did solve my problem. I had tried most of the other recommendations before coming to the following solution.My Scenario/Problem: \nUsing VS 2017 with Resharper Ultimate. Keyboard input in the IDE got super slow as others have described. The last change I made to my solution was to add a new web site project so I looked into that. After trying a lot of things, I tried adding a second web site project so I could try to replace the first one and Visual Studio just tanked after that. It wouldn\'t even load the solution anymore.My Solution:\nI forced Visual Studio closed and then I removed the newly added web site project(s) from the sln file using notepad. After saving and starting VS, my solution loaded quickly and everything seemed to be back to normal. I added a new Web Site with a slightly different configuration (see thinking below) and the problem did not present itself again. My Thinking:\nI think the problem stemmed from creating the new web site project and using a File System path to a network share that is hosted in Azure. I\'m working over VPN which tends to slow things down and I occasionally experience various routing problems with some services so my problem/solution might be a bit of a snowflake. I changed the File System path to be a local repository and will publish the files as needed which seems like a much better way to go.
