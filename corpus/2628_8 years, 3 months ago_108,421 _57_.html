Mercurial has a way of printing the root directory (that contains .hg) viaIs there something equivalent in git to get the directory that contains the .git directory?Yes:The man page for git-config (under Alias) says:If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point, it will be treated as a shell\n  command. For example, defining "alias.new = !gitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD", the invocation "git\n  new" is equivalent to running the shell command "gitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD". Note that shell\n  commands will be executed from the top-level directory of a repository, which may not\n  necessarily be the current directory.So, on UNIX you can do:Has --show-toplevel only recently been added to git rev-parse or why is nobody mentioning it?From the git rev-parse man page:How about "git rev-parse --git-dir" ?The --git-dir option seems to work.From git rev-parse manual page:You can see it in action in this git setup-sh script.If you\'re already in the top-level or not in a git repository cd $(git rev-parse --show-cdup) will take you home (just cd).  cd ./$(git rev-parse --show-cdup) is one way of fixing that.To write a simple answer here, so that we can useto do the job, simply configure your git by usingand then you might want to add the following to your ~/.bashrc:so that you can just use cdroot to go to top of your repo.To calculate the absolute path of the current git root directory, say for use in a shell script, use this combination of readlink and git rev-parse:git-rev-parse --show-cdup gives you the right number of ".."s to get\nto the root from your cwd, or the empty string if you are at the root.\nThen prepend "./" to deal with the empty string case and use\nreadlink -f to translate to a full path.You could also create a git-root command in your PATH as a shell script to apply this technique:(The above can be pasted into a terminal to create git-root and set execute bits; the actual script is in lines 2, 3 and 4.)And then you\'d be able to run git root to get the root of your current tree.\nNote that in the shell script, use "-e" to cause the shell to exit if the rev-parse fails so that you can properly get the exit status and error message if you are not in a git directory.As others have noted, the core of the solution is to use git rev-parse --show-cdup. However, there are a few of edge cases to address:When the cwd already is the root of the working tree, the command yields an empty string.\nActually it produces an empty line, but command substitution strip off the trailing line break. The final result is an empty string.Most answers suggest prepending the output with ./ so that an empty output becomes "./" before it is fed to cd.When GIT_WORK_TREE is set to a location that is not the parent of the cwd, the output may be an absolute pathname.Prepending ./ is wrong in this situation. If a ./ is prepended to an absolute path, it becomes a relative path (and they only refer to the same location if the cwd is the root directory of the system).The output may contain whitespace.This really only applies in the second case, but it has an easy fix: use double quotes around the command substitution (and any subsequent uses of the value).As other answers have noted, we can do cd "./$(git rev-parse --show-cdup)", but this breaks in the second edge case (and the third edge case if we leave off the double quotes).Many shells treat cd "" as a no-op, so for those shells we could do cd "$(git rev-parse --show-cdup)" (the double quotes protect the empty string as an argument in the first edge case, and preserve whitespace in the third edge case). POSIX says the result of cd "" is unspecified, so it may be best to avoid making this assumption.A solution that works in all of the above cases requires a test of some sort. Done explicitly, it might look like this:No cd is done for the first edge case.If it is acceptable to run cd . for the first edge case, then the conditional can be done in the expansion of the parameter:To amend the "git config" answer just a bit:and get the path cleaned up.  Very nice.If you\'re looking for a good alias to do this plus not blow up cd if you aren\'t in a git dir:This shell alias works whether you are in a git subdir, or at the top level:updated to use modern syntax instead of backticks: Just in case if you\'re feeding this path to the Git itself, use :/Everything else fails at some point either going to the home directory or just miserably failing. This is the quickest and shortest way to get back to the GIT_DIR.Here is a script that I\'ve written that handles both cases: 1) repository with a workspace, 2) bare repository.https://gist.github.com/jdsumsion/6282953git-root (executable file in your path):Hopefully this is helpful.Short solutions that work with submodules, in hooks, and inside the .git directoryHere\'s the short answer that most will want:This will work anywhere in a git working tree (including inside the .git directory), but assumes that repository directory(s) are called .git (which is the default). With submodules, this will go to the root of the outermost containing repository. If you want to get to the root of the current submodule use:To easily execute a command in your submodule root, under [alias] in your .gitconfig, add:This allows you to easily do things like git sh ag <string>Robust solution that supports differently named or external .git or $GIT_DIR directories.Note that $GIT_DIR may point somewhere external (and not be called .git), hence the need for further checking. Put this in your .bashrc: Execute it by typing git_root (after restarting your shell: exec bash)adds $ git root\nsee https://github.com/tj/git-extras/blob/master/Commands.md#git-rootHad to solve this myself today. Solved it in C# as I needed it for a program, but I guess it can be esily rewritten. Consider this Public Domain.
