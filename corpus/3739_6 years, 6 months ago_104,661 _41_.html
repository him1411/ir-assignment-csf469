Is there markdown syntax for the equivalent of:should be the correct markdown syntax to jump to the anchor point named pookie.To insert an anchor point of that name use HTML:Markdown doesn\'t seem to mind where you put the anchor point. A useful place to put it is in a header. For example:works very well.  (I\'d demonstrate here but SO\'s renderer strips out the anchor.)An earlier version of this post suggested using <a id=\'tith\' />, using the self-closing syntax for XHTML, and using the id attribute instead of name.XHTML allows for any tag to be \'empty\' and \'self-closed\'.  That is, <tag /> is short-hand for <tag></tag>, a matched pair of tags with an empty body. Most browsers will accept XHTML, but some do not. To avoid cross-browser problems, close the tag explicitly using <tag></tag>, as recommended above.Finally, the attribute name= was deprecated in XHTML, so I originally used id=, which everyone recognises. However, HTML5 now creates a global variable in JavaScript when using id=, and this may not necessarily be what you want. So, using name= is now likely to be more friendly.(Thanks to Slipp Douglas for explaining XHTML to me, and nailer for pointing out the HTML5 side-effect \xe2\x80\x94 see the comments and nailer\'s answer for more detail. name= appears to work everywhere, though it is deprecated in XHTML.)Use a name. Using an id isn\'t necessary in HTML 5 and will create global variables in your JavaScriptSee the HTML 5 specification, 5.9.8 Navigating to a fragment identifier - both id and name are used.It\'s important to know that most browsers still turn IDs into global variables. Here\'s a quick test. Using a name avoids creating globals and any conflicts that may result.Example using a name:And the destination anchor:On bitbucket.org the voted solution wouldn\'t work. Instead, when using headers (with ##), it is possible to reference them as anchors by prefixing them as #markdown-header-my-header-name, where #markdown-header- is an implicit prefix generated by the renderer, and the rest is the lower-cased header title with dashes replacing spaces.Examplewill produce an implicit anchor like thisThe whole URL before each anchor reference is optional, i.e. is equivalent of provided that they are in the same page.Source: https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo/overview (edit source of this .md file and look at how anchors are made). There\'s no readily available syntax to do this in the original Markdown syntax, but Markdown Extra provides a means to at least assign IDs to headers \xe2\x80\x94 which you can then link to easily. Note also that you can use regular HTML in both Markdown and Markdown Extra, and that the name attribute has been superseded by the id attribute in more recent versions of HTML.Late to the party, but I think this addition might be useful for people working with rmarkdown. In rmarkdown there is built-in support for references to headers in your document.Any header defined bycan be referenced by The following is a minimal standalone .rmd file that shows this behavior. It can be knitted to .pdf and .html.For most common markdown generators. You have a simple self generated anchor in each header. For instance with pandoc, the generated anchor will be a kebab case slug of your header.Depending on which markdown parser you use, the anchor can change (take the exemple of symbolrush and La muerte Peluda answers, they are different!). See this babelmark where you can see generated anchors depending on your markdown implementation.Markdown Anchor supports the hashmark, so a link to an anchor in the page would simply be [Pookie](#pookie)Generating the anchor is not actually supported in Gruber Markdown, but is in other implementations, such as Markdown Extra.In Markdown Extra, the anchor ID is appended to a header or subhead with {#pookie}.Github Flavored Markdown in Git repository pages (but not in Gists) automatically generates anchors with several markup tags on all headers (h1, h2, h3, etc.), including:Excluding the aria/svg icon, when one writes:Github generates:Therefore, one need do nothing to create the header links, and can always link to them with:Using the latest Markdown, you should be able to use the following syntax:[](){:name=\'anchorName\'}This should create the following HTML: <a name="anchorName"></a>If you wanted the anchor to have text, simply add the test within the square brackets:`Some Text{:name=\'anchorName\'}
