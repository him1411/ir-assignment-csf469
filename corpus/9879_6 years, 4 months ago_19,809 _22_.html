Visual Studio remembers breakpoints from previous debugging sessions, which is awesome.However, when I\'m debugging, and I clear one of these "old" breakpoints by clicking on it, it\'s only temporarily deleted. What I mean is the next time I debug, the breakpoint that I thought I removed is back. This is super annoying--is there a setting to make it not do this? go to Debug menu then Delete All Breakpoints Ctrl+Shift+F9The problem is that child breakpoints of your breakpoints persist.\nYou could run the macro posted here, between debug session to remove child breakpoints, which will make removing breakpoints more effective\xe2\x80\x94but it continues to be problematic and awkward.\nA more surefire way of deleting a breakpoint is to manually look for it in the breakpoint window, and delete it from there.There are some answers here, but in my opinion proposed actions are distractive to use during debugging (I don\'t want to lose my focus). My flow with sticky breakpoints during breakpoints is as follows:During debug, DISABLE the breakpoint instead of removing it. Possible ways of disabling a breakpoint:Later on, during development, I remove a disabled breakpoint when I see one.PS. It\'s also a good practice to remove all breakpoints once in a while.I was struggling to find the \'BreakPoints Window\'.So here\'s the quick way to open it- ctrl+alt+B  Or you can manually go to \'Debug->Windows->Breakpoints\' to open it.Or you can hit ctrl+shift+F9 to delete all breakpoints at once!Most breakpoints can be removed during debug-session, but some are stuck (probably a bug in Visual Studio). It you want to remove only the breakpoint which is stuck, then use the "Breakpoints" windows found on the debug menu. There you will probably see that your breakpoint exist multiple times for the same row. Simply rightclick and delete it.  A quick alternative answer to this old question that just hit me with Visual Studio 2017.If possible, just cut and paste the code with the breakpoint on it. The breakpoint goes away with the cut.Go to debug > windows > breakpoints and find breakpoints and remove those from pane.as It was answered here
