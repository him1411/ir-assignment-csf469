I added the public ssh key to the authorized_keys file.  ssh localhost should log me in without asking for the password.  I did that and tried typing ssh localhost, but it still asks me to type in the password. Is there any other setting that I have to go through to make it work?I have followed instruction for changing permissions:Below is the result if I do ssh -v localhostThen it asks for passphase after the above log.  Why isn\'t it logging me in without a password?You need to verify the permissions of the authorized_keys file and the folder / parent folders in which it is located.For more information see http://www.openssh.org/faq.html#3.14 (dead link)Cached copy: https://web.archive.org/web/20140327182105/http://www.openssh.org/faq.html#3.14You may also need to change/verify the permissions of your home directory to remove write access for the group and others.SELinux can also cause authorized_keys not to work. Especially for root in CentOS 6 and 7. No need to disable it though. Once you\'ve verified your permissions are correct, you can fix this like so:setting ssh authorized_keys seem to be simple but hides some traps I\'m trying to figure-- SERVER --in /etc/ssh/sshd_config set  passwordAuthentication yes to let server temporary accept password authentication-- CLIENT -- consider  cygwin as linux emulation and install & run openssh1.  generate private and public keys (client side)\n# ssh-keygenhere pressing just ENTER you get DEFAULT\n2 files "id_rsa" and "id_rsa.pub" in ~/.ssh/ but if you give a name_for_the_key the generated files are saved in your pwd 2. place the your_key.pub to target machine ssh-copy-id user_name@host_nameif  you didn\'t create default key this is the first step to go wrong \n... you should usessh-copy-id -i path/to/key_name.pub user_name@host_name3. logging ssh user_name@host_name will  work only for default id_rsa so here is 2nd trap for you need to ssh -i path/to/key_name user@host(use ssh -v ... option to see what is happening)If server still asks for password then  you gave smth.  to Enter passphrase: when you\'ve  created keys ( so it\'s normal)  if ssh is not listening default port 22 must use ssh -p port_nr -- SERVER -----4.  modify  /etc/ssh/sshd_config to have(uncoment if case)This tells ssh to accept authorized_keys and look in user home directory for key_name sting written  in .ssh/authorized_keys file5  set permissions in target machineAlso turn off pass auth passwordAuthentication no to close the gate to all ssh root/admin/....@your_domain  attempts6 ensure ownership and group ownership of all non-root home directories are appropriate.===============================================7. consider the excelent  http://www.fail2ban.org8. extra\nssh TUNNEL to access a MySQL (bind = 127.0.0.1) severAlso be sure your home directory is not writeable by othersAnswer is stolen from here Listing a public key in .ssh/authorized_keys is necessary but not sufficient for sshd (server) to accept it.  If your private key is passphrase-protected, you\'ll need to give ssh (client) the passphrase every time.  Or you can use ssh-agent, or a gnome equivalent.Your UPDATE\'d trace is consistent with a passphrase-protected private key.  See ssh-agent, or ssh-keygen -p.the desperate may also make sure they don\'t have extra newlines in the authorized_keys file due to copying id_rsa.pub text out of a confused terminal.Beware that SELinux can trigger this error as well, even if all permissions seem to be OK. Disabling it did the trick for me (insert usual disclaimers about disabling it).The thing that did the trick for me finally was to make sure that the owner/group were not root but user:user is your usernameTry "ssh-add" which worked for me.Write command:After you do this, make sure your dir is like that:Another tip to remember. Since v7.0 OpenSSH disables DSS/DSA ssh keys by default due to their inherit weakness. So if you have OpenSSH v7.0+, make sure your key is not ssh-dss.If you are stuck with DSA keys, you can re-enable support locally by\n  updating your sshd_config and ~/.ssh/config files with lines like so: PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-dssMake sure that the target user has a password set. Run passwd username to set one. This was required for me even if password SSH login was disabled.I issued sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh and chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and chmod go-w $HOME $HOME/.ssh from above and it fixed my problem on a CentOS7 box that I had messed up the permissions on while trying to get samba shares working.  Thanksthis solves my problemssh-agent bashssh-addAnother issue you have to take care. If your generated file is not default \nid_rsa  and  id_rsa.pubYou have to create .ssh/config file and define manually which id file you are going to use with the connection.Example is here:In my case I needed to put my authorized_keys file in .openssh. This location is specified in /etc/ssh/sshd_config under the option AuthorizedKeysFile  %h/.ssh/authorized_keys.on that note, make sure you sshd config has -;set as the above, then restart sshd(/etc/init.d/sshd restart)log-out and  try log-in in again!default I believe is -;It seems like a permission problem. Usually it happens if the permission of some file/directory is not correctly set up. In most case they are ~/.ssh and ~/.ssh/*. In my case they are /home/xxx.You can changing the log level of sshd by modifying /etc/ssh/sshd_config(search LogLevel, set it to DEBUG), then check the output in /var/log/auth.log to see what happened exactly.In my case it\'s because the user\'s group is not set in AllowGroups of config file /etc/ssh/sshd_config. After adding it everything works fine. My problem was a modified AuthorizedKeysFile, when the automation to populate /etc/ssh/authorized_keys had not yet been run.I have the home directory in a non-standard location and in sshd logs I have this line:even if all permissions were just fine (see the other answers).I have found a solution here: http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=25813191&sid=0876f069ec2aa5fdcd691a2e2e7242c2#p25813191In my particular case:added a new line in /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts.homedirs:this is the original line for regular home directories:/home/[^/]*/\\.ssh(/.*)? unconfined_u:object_r:ssh_home_t:s0this is my new line:/data/home/[^/]*/\\.ssh(/.*)? unconfined_u:object_r:ssh_home_t:s0followed by a restorecon -r /data/ and a sshd restart
