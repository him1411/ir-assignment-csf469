I\'m trying to generate a view with a gradient color background (A solid color to transparent) at runtime. Is there a way of doing that?Info: use startPoint and endPoint to change direction of gradient.If there are any other views added onto this UIView (such as a UILabel), you may want to consider setting the background color of those UIView\xe2\x80\x99s to [UIColor clearColor] so the gradient view is presented instead of the background color for sub views. Using clearColor has a slight performance hit.This is my recommended approach.To promote reusability, I\'d say create a category of CAGradientLayer and add your desired gradients as class methods. Specify them in the header file like this :Then in your implementation file, specify each gradient with this syntax :Then simply import this category in your ViewController or any other required subclass, and use it like this :Since I only needed one type of gradient throughout my app I created a subclass of UIView and preconfigured the gradient layer on initialization with fixed colors.\nThe initializers of UIView call the configureGradientLayer-method, which configures the CAGradientLayer:DDGradientView.h:DDGradientView.m:You can create a custom class GradientView: Swift 3Swift 2.2In storyboard, set the class type to any view that you want to have gradient background: This is better in the following ways: Swift Implementation:Try This it worked like a charm for me,I have set RGB gradient background Color to UIviewHope this is help for some one .I have implemented this in swift with an extension:Swift 3Swift 2.2No I can set a gradient on every view like this:What you are looking for is CAGradientLayer.  Every UIView has a layer - into that layer you can add sublayers, just as you can add subviews.  One specific type is the CAGradientLayer, where you give it an array of colors to gradiate between.One example is this simple wrapper for a gradient view:http://oleb.net/blog/2010/04/obgradientview-a-simple-uiview-wrapper-for-cagradientlayer/Note that you need to include the QuartZCore framework in order to access all of the layer parts of a UIView.I\'ve extended the accepted answer a little using Swift\'s extension functionality as well as an enum.Oh and if you are using Storyboard like I do, make sure to call gradientBackground(from:to:direction:) in viewDidLayoutSubviews() or later.Swift 3A Swift ApproachThis answer builds on the answers above and provides implementation for dealing with the problem of the gradient not being properly applied during rotation. It satisfies this problem by changing the gradient layer to a square so that rotation in all directions results in a correct gradient. The function signature includes a Swift variadic argument that allows one to pass in as many CGColorRef\'s (CGColor) as needed (see sample usage). Also provided is an example as a Swift extension so that one can apply a gradient to any UIView.To use:in viewDidLoad...Extension implementationExtension use-case example:Which means the gradient background can now be applied to any UIControl since all controls are UIViews (or a subclass) and all UIViews have CALayers.My solution is to create UIView subclass with CAGradientLayer accessible as a readonly property. This will allow you to customize your gradient how you want and you don\'t need to handle layout changes yourself. Subclass implementation:Usage:Simple swift view based on Yuchen\'s versionThen you can use gradientLayer after initialization like this...SWIFT 3TO ADD A GRADIENT LAYER ON YOUR VIEWBIND YOUR VIEW OUTLET DEFINE THE CAGradientLayer()HERE IS THE CODE YOU HAVE TO WRITE IN YOUR VIEWDIDLOADYOURVIEW.layoutIfNeeded()gradient.startPoint = CGPoint(x: CGFloat(0), y: CGFloat(1))\n    gradient.endPoint = CGPoint(x: CGFloat(1), y: CGFloat(0))\n    gradient.frame = YOURVIEW.bounds\n    gradient.colors = [UIColor.red.cgColor, UIColor.green.cgColor]\n    gradient.colors = [ UIColor(red: 255.0/255.0, green: 56.0/255.0, blue: 224.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0).cgColor,UIColor(red: 86.0/255.0, green: 13.0/255.0, blue: 232.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0).cgColor,UIColor(red: 16.0/255.0, green: 173.0/255.0, blue: 245.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0).cgColor]\n    gradient.locations = [0.0 ,0.6 ,1.0]\n    YOURVIEW.layer.insertSublayer(gradient, at: 0)I have implemented this in my code.Now I can see a gradient on my view.USAGEIn Swift 3.1\nI have added this extension to UIViewwhich I then call with
