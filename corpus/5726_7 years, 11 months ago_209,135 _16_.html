I did a \'git commit\' but I have not pushed to others.\nso when i do \'git status\', I get \'# Your branch is ahead of \'master\' by 1 commit.\'So if I want to roll back my top commit,  can I just do"given that when i do \'git log\'Actually, when you use git reset, you should refer to the commit that you are resetting to; so you would want the db0c078 commit, probably.An easier version would be git reset --hard HEAD^, to reset to the previous commit before the current head; that way you don\'t have to be copying around commit IDs.Beware when you do any git reset --hard, as you can lose any uncommitted changes you have. You might want to check git status to make sure your working copy is clean, or that you do want to blow away any changes that are there.In addition, instead of HEAD you can use origin/master as reference, as suggested by @bdonlan in the comments: git reset --hard origin/masterIF you have NOT pushed your changes to remoteCheck if the working copy is clean by git status.ELSE you have pushed your changes to remoteThis command will revert/remove the last one commit/change and then you can pushto reset it to whatever the origin was at.This was posted by @bdonlan in the comments.  I added this answer for people who don\'t read comments.I have experienced the same situation I did the below as this much easier.\nBy passing commit-Id you can reach to the particular commit you want to go:As you want to remove your last commit so you need to pass the commit-Id where you need to move your pointer:One way would be to delete the local branch and checkout that branch from the server if your local branch is ahead of remote by multiple commits and you need to uncommit all of them.
