I want to make a pause between two lines of code, Let me explain a bit: -> the user clicks a button (a card in fact) and I show it by changing the background of this button: -> after let\'s say 1 second, I need to go back to the previous state of the button by changing back its background: -> I\'ve tried to pause the thread between these two lines of code with:However, this does not work. Maybe it\'s the process and not the Thread that I need to pause?I\'ve also tried (but it doesn\'t work):With this:How can I pause/sleep the thread or process?A good solution to this problem is to use the Handler.postDelayed() method.  The solution below, however, causes a memory leak because it uses a non-static inner and anonymous class which implicitly holds a reference to its outer class, the activity.  This is a problem when the activity context is supposed to be garbage collected:A better solution subclasses the Handler and Runnable with static inner classes inside the activity since static inner classes do not hold an implicit reference to their outer class:Note that the Runnable uses a WeakReference to the Activity, which is necessary in a static class that needs access to the UI.You can try this one it is short WARNING: Never, ever, do this on a UI thread.Use this to sleep eg. background thread.Full solution for your problem will be:\nThis is available API 1Without creating tmp Handler. Also this solution is better than @tronman because we do not retain view by Handler.\nAlso we don\'t have problem with Handler created at bad thread ;) Documentationpublic static void sleep (long ms)Added in API level 1Waits a given number of milliseconds (of uptimeMillis) before returning. Similar to sleep(long), but does not throw InterruptedException; interrupt() events are deferred until the\n  next interruptible operation. \n  Does not return until at least the specified number of milliseconds has elapsed.Parametersms to sleep before returning, in milliseconds of uptime.Code for postDelayed from View class:I use this:You probably don\'t want to do it that way. By putting an explicit sleep() in your button-clicked event handler, you would actually lock up the whole UI for a second. One alternative is to use some sort of single-shot Timer. Create a TimerTask to change the background color back to the default color, and schedule it on the Timer.Another possibility is to use a Handler. There\'s a tutorial about somebody who switched from using a Timer to using a Handler.Incidentally, you can\'t pause a process. A Java (or Android) process has at least 1 thread, and you can only sleep threads.This is what I did at the end of the day - works fine now :In addition to Mr. Yankowsky\'s answers, you could also use postDelayed(). This is available on any View (e.g., your card) and takes a Runnable and a delay period. It executes the Runnable after that delay.I use CountDownTimeThis is my exampleCreate a Java Utils
