Given a datetime.time value in Python, is there a standard way to add an integer number of seconds to it, so that 11:34:59 + 3 = 11:35:02, for example?These obvious ideas don\'t work:In the end I have written functions like this:I can\'t help thinking that I\'m missing an easier way to do this though.You can use full datetime variables with timedelta, and by providing a dummy date then using time to just get the time value.For example:results in the two values, three seconds apart:You could also opt for the more readableif you\'re so inclined.If you\'re after a function that can do this, you can look into using addSecs below:This outputs:As others here have stated, you can just use full datetime objects throughout:However, I think it\'s worth explaining why full datetime objects are required.  Consider what would happen if I added 2 hours to 11pm.  What\'s the correct behavior?  An exception, because you can\'t have a time larger than 11:59pm?  Should it wrap back around?Different programmers will expect different things, so whichever result they picked would surprise a lot of people.  Worse yet, programmers would write code that worked just fine when they tested it initially, and then have it break later by doing something unexpected.  This is very bad, which is why you\'re not allowed to add timedelta objects to time objects.One little thing, might add clarity to override the default value for secondsThanks to @Pax Diablo, @bvmou and @Arachnid for the suggestion of using full datetimes throughout.  If I have to accept datetime.time objects from an external source, then this seems to be an alternative add_secs_to_time() function:This verbose code can be compressed to this one-liner:but I think I\'d want to wrap that up in a function for code clarity anyway.If it\'s worth adding another file / dependency to your project, I\'ve just written a tiny little class that extends datetime.time with the ability to do arithmetic.  When you go past midnight, it wraps around zero.  Now, "What time will it be, 24 hours from now" has a lot of corner cases, including daylight savings time, leap seconds, historical timezone changes, and so on.  But sometimes you really do need the simple case, and that\'s what this will do.Your example would be written:nptime inherits from datetime.time, so any of those methods should be usable, too.It\'s available from PyPi as nptime ("non-pedantic time"), or on GitHub: https://github.com/tgs/nptimeTry adding a datetime.datetime to a datetime.timedelta. If you only want the time portion, you can call the time() method on the resultant datetime.datetime object to get it.
