I would like to move one DIV element inside another. For example, I want to move this (including all children):into this:so that I have this:You may want to use the appendTo function (which adds to the end of the element):Alternatively you could use the prependTo function (which adds to the beginning of the element):my solution:MOVE:COPY:Note the usage of .detach(). When copying, be careful that you are not duplicating IDs.I just used:Which I grabbed from here.If the div where you want to put your element has content inside, and you want the element to show after the main content:If the div where you want to put your element has content inside, and you want to show the element before the main content:If the div where you want to put your element is empty, or you want to replace it entirely:If you want to duplicate an element before any of the above:What about a JavaScript solution?Declare a fragment:var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();Append desired element to the fragment:fragment.appendChild(document.getElementById(\'source\'));Append fragment to desired element:document.getElementById(\'destination\').appendChild(fragment);Check it out.You can use:To Insert After,To Insert inside another element,If you want a quick demo and more details about how you move elements, try this link:http://html-tuts.com/move-div-in-another-div-with-jqueryHere is a short example:To move ABOVE an element:To move AFTER an element:To move inside an element, ABOVE ALL elements inside that container:To move inside an element, AFTER ALL elements inside that container:Old question but got here because I need to move content from one container to another including all the event listeners.jQuery doesn\'t have a way to do it but standard DOM function appendChild does.Using appendChild removes the .source and places it into target including it\'s event listeners: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.appendChildYou can use following code to move source to destination   try working codepenEver tried plain JavaScript... destination.appendChild(source); ? I noticed huge memory leak & performance difference between insertAfter & after or insertBefore & before .. If you have tons of DOM elements, or you need to use after() or before() inside a MouseMove event, the browser memory will probably increase and next operations will run really slow. The solution I\'ve just experienced is to use inserBefore instead before() and insertAfter instead after().You may also try:But this will completely overwrite anything you have in #destination.
