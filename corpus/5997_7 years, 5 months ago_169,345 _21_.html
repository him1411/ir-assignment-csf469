I\'m totally new to the ASP.NET MVC stack, and I was wondering what happened to the simple Page object and the Request ServerVariables object?Basically, I want to to pull out the client PC\'s IP address, but I fail to understand how the current MVC structure has changed all of this.As far as I can understand, most of the variable objects has been replaced by the HttpRequest variants.Anybody care to share some resources? There is really a sea of stuff to learn in the ASP.NET MVC world. :)For example, I have a static class with this current function. How do I get the same result using ASP.NET MVC?And how do I call this function from the controller page?The simple answer is to use the HttpRequest.UserHostAddress property.Example: From within a Controller:Example: From within a helper class:BUT,  if the request has been passed on by one, or more, proxy servers then the IP address returned by HttpRequest.UserHostAddress property will be the IP address of the last proxy server that relayed the request.Proxy servers MAY use the de facto standard of placing the client\'s IP address in the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. Aside from there is no guarantee that a request has a X-Forwarded-For header, there is also no guarantee that the X-Forwarded-For hasn\'t been SPOOFED.Original AnswerThe above code provides the Client\'s IP address without resorting to looking up a collection. The Request property is available within Controllers (or Views). Therefore instead of passing a Page class to your function you can pass a Request object to get the same result:Request.ServerVariables["REMOTE_ADDR"] should work - either directly in a view or in the controller action method body (Request is a property of Controller class in MVC, not Page).It is working.. but you have to publish on a real IIS not the virtual one.A lot of the code here was very helpful, but I cleaned it up for my purposes and added some tests.  Here\'s what I ended up with:And here are some NUnit tests against that code (I\'m using Rhino Mocks to mock the HttpRequestBase, which is the M<HttpRequestBase> call below):I had trouble using the above, and I needed the IP address from a controller. I used the following in the end:In a class you might call it like this:I used this in a razor app with great results.How I account for my site being behind an Amazon AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):
