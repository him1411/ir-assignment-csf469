Rails defines a bunch of magic with named routes that make helpers for your routes. Sometimes, especially with nested routes, it can get a little confusing to keep track of what URL you\'ll get for a given route helper method call. Is it possible to, using the Ruby console, see what link a given helper function will generate? For example, given a named helper like post_path(post) I want to see what URL is generated.You can show them with rake routes directly.In a Rails console, you can call app.post_path. This will work in Rails ~= 2.3 and >= 3.1.0.you can alsofrom inside a console sessions to access the helpers:In the Rails console, the variable app holds a session object on which you can call path and URL helpers as instance methods.
