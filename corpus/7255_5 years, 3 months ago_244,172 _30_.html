I am trying to use the ng-click feature of AngularJS to switch views. How would I go about doing this with the code below?index.htmlcontroller.jsIn order to switch between different views, you could directly change the window.location (using the $location service!) in\nindex.html fileController.jsand configure the router to switch to different partials based on the location ( as shown here https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/blob/master/app/app.js ). This would have the benefit of history as well as using ng-view. Alternatively, you use ng-include with different partials and then use a ng-switch as shown in here ( https://github.com/ganarajpr/Angular-UI-Components/blob/master/index.html )The provided answer is absolutely correct, but I wanted to expand for any future visitors who may want to do it a bit more dynamically - In the view - In the controller - Same basic concept as the accepted answer, just adding some dynamic content to it to improve a bit.  If the accepted answer wants to add this I will delete my answer.I\'ve got an example working.Here\'s how my doc looks:Here\'s what my partial looks like:  Here\'s what my Ctrl looks like:app is my module:Hope this is helpful!The method used for all previous answers to this question suggest changing the url which is not necessary, and I think readers should be aware of an alternative solution.  I use ui-router and $stateProvider to associate a state value with a templateUrl which points to the html file for your view.  Then it is just a matter of injecting the $state into your controller and calling $state.go(\'state-value\') to update your view.What is the difference between angular-route and angular-ui-router?Without doing a full revamp of the default routing (#/ViewName) environment, I was able to do a slight modification of Cody\'s tip and got it working great.the controllerthe viewWhat brought me to this solution was when I was attempting to integrate a Kendo Mobile UI widget into an angular environment I was losing the context of my controller and the behavior of the regular anchor tag was also being hijacked. I re-established my context from within the Kendo widget and needed to use a method to navigate...this worked.Thanks for the previous posts!There are two ways for this:If you are using ui-router or $stateProvider, do it as:if you are using angular-router or $routeProvider, do it as:Hope this will help youThis little function has served me well:You dont need the full path, just the view you are switching to
