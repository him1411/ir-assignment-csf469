I am using centos 7 and I have to ensure that ports 2888 and 3888 are open.I read this article but this did not work because on centos 7 OS there is no iptables save command.someone told me that the above URL is not valid for centos 7. and I should follow thisbut this article is not clear to me on exactly what command I need to execute.I also found but this does not survive reboots.So how can I open the ports and make it survive rebootsUse this command to find your active zone(s):It will say either public, dmz, or something else. You should only apply to the zones required. In the case of dmz try:Otherwise, substitute dmz for your zone, for example, if your zone is public:Then remember to reload the firewall for changes to take effect.The answer by ganeshragav is correct, but \nit is also useful to know that you can use:but if is a known service, you can use:and then reload the firewall[ Answer modified to reflect Martin Peter\'s comment, original answer had --permanent at end of command line ]CentOS (RHEL) 7, has changed the firewall to use firewall-cmd which has a notion of zones which is like a Windows version of Public, Home, and Private networks.  You should look here to figure out which one you think you should use.  EL7 uses public by default so that is what my examples below use.You can check which zone you are using with firewall-cmd --list-all and change it with firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=<zone>.You will then know what zone to allow a service (or port) on:firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=<zone> --add-service=httpfirewall-cmd --permanent --zone=<zone> --add-port=80/tcpYou can check if the port has actually be opened by running: firewall-cmd --zone=<zone> --query-port=80/tcpfirewall-cmd --zone=<zone> --query-service=httpAccording to the documentation,When making changes to the firewall settings in Permanent mode, your\n  selection will only take effect when you reload the firewall or the\n  system restarts.You can reload the firewall settings with: firewall-cmd --reload.Fedora, did it via iptablesSeems to workWhile ganeshragav and Sotsir provide correct and directly applicable approaches, it is useful to note that you can add your own services to /etc/firewalld/services. For inspiration, look at /usr/lib/firewalld/services/, where firewalld\'s predefined services are located.The advantage of this approach is that later you will know why these ports are open, as you\'ve described it in the service file. Also, you can now apply it to any zone without the risk of typos. Furthermore, changes to the service will not need to be applied to all zones separately, but just to the service file.For example, you can create /etc/firewalld/services/foobar.xml:(For information about the syntax, do man firewalld.service.)Once this file is created, you can firewall-cmd --reload to have it become available and then permanently add it to some zone withfollowed with firewall-cmd --reload to make it active right away.If you are familiar with iptables service like in centos 6 or earlier, you can still use iptables service by manual installation:step 1 => install epel repoyum install epel-releasestep 2 => install iptables serviceyum install iptables-servicesstep 3 => stop firewalld servicesystemctl stop firewalldstep 4 => disable firewalld service on startupsystemctl disable firewalldstep 5 => start iptables servicesystemctl start iptablesstep 6 => enable iptables on startupsystemctl enable iptablesfinally you\'re now can editing your iptables config at /etc/sysconfig/iptables.So -> edit rule -> reload/restart.do like older centos with same function like firewalld.The top answers here work, but I found something more elegant in Michael Hampton\'s answer to a related question.  The "new" (firewalld-0.3.9-11+) --runtime-to-permanent option to firewall-cmd lets you create runtime rules and test them out before making them permanent:Or to revert the runtime-only changes:Also see Antony Nguyen\'s comment.  Apparently firewall-cmd --reload may not work properly in some cases where rules have been removed. In that case, he suggests restarting the firewalld service:
