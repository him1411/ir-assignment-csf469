I remember seeing in either IntelliJ or Eclipse the setting to reformat (cleanup) files whenever they are saved. How do I find it (didn\'t find it in the settings)I suggest the save actions plugin. It also supports optimize imports and rearrange code.Works well in combination with the eclipse formatter plugin.Search and activate the plugin:Configure it:Edit: it seems like it the recent version of Intellij the save action plugin is triggered by the automatic Intellij save. This can be quite annoying when it hits while still editing.This github issue of the plugin gives a hint to some possible solutions:https://github.com/dubreuia/intellij-plugin-save-actions/issues/63I actually tried to assign reformat to Ctrl+S and it worked fine - saving is done automatically now.This solution worked better for me:Note: You will have to check the box "Do not show this message again" the first time for the organized imports, but it works as expected after that.step 2. with: Edit -> Macros -> "Start Macro Recording"\nstep 6. with: Edit -> Macros -> "Stop Macro Recording"Everything else remains the same.-Neil8. The Preferences contain the Keymap settings. Use the input field to filter the content, as shown in the screenshot.Below is Neil\'s answer updated.I set it to automatically clean up on check-in, which is usually good enough for me. If something is too ugly, I\'ll just hit the shortcut (Ctrl-Alt-L, Return). And I see they have an option for auto-formatting pasted code, although I\'ve never used that.Ctrl + Alt + L is format file (includes the two below)Ctrl + Alt + O is optimize importsCtrl + Alt + I will fix indentation on a particular lineI usually run Ctrl + Alt + L a few times before committing my work.  I\'d rather it do the cleanup/reformatting at my command instead of automatically.I wound up rebinding the Reformat code... action to Ctrl-S, replacing the default binding for Save All.It may sound crazy at first, but IntelliJ seems to save on virtually every action: running tests, building the project, even when closing an editor tab. I have a habit of hitting Ctrl-S pretty often, so this actually works quite well for me. It\'s certainly easier to type than the default bind for reformatting.I thought there was something like that in IntelliJ, but I can\'t find it.  The only clean-up that happens at save is that white space at the ends of lines is removed.  I thought I had to specify that behavior at one point, but I don\'t see anything related at this point.IntellIJ 14 && 15: When you are checking in code in Commit changes dialog, tick the Reformat code checkbox, then IntelliJ will reformatting all the code that you are checking in.Source: www.udemy.com/intellij-idea-secrets-double-your-coding-speed-in-2-hours
