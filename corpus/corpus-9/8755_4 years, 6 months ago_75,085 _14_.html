I stashed my changes. Now I want to unstash only some files from the stash. How can I do this?As mentioned below, and detailed in "How would I extract a single file (or changes to a file) from a git stash?", you can apply use git checkout or git show to restore a specific file.(As commented by Jaime M., for certain shell like tcsh where you need to escape the special characters, the syntax would be:  git checkout \'stash@{0}\' -- <filename>)or to save it under another filename:(note that here <full filename> is full pathname of a file relative to top directory of a project (think: relative to stash@{0})).yucer suggests in the comments:If you want to select manually which changes you want to apply from that file:Vivek adds in the comments:Looks like "git checkout stash@{0} -- <filename>" restores the version of the file as of the time when the stash was performed -- it does NOT apply (just) the stashed changes for that file.\n  To do the latter: As commented: "unstash" (git stash pop), then:The last point is what allows you to keep some file while stashing others.\nIt is illustrated in "How to stash only one file out of multiple files that have changed".Eg.\nTo restore only ./test.c file and ./include folder from last stashed,I think VonC\'s answer is probably what you want, but here\'s a way to do a selective "git apply":If you git stash pop (with no conflicts) it will remove the stash after it is applied.  But if you git stash apply it will apply the patch without removing it from the stash list.  Then you can revert the unwanted changes with git checkout -- files...
