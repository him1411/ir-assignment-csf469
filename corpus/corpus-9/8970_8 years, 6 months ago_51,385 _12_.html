What is the official name for the "special" ASP.NET tags like this:I can\'t seem to figure out the conceptual or well known name for these, so I\'m having trouble searching for more info.  As a bonus, can anyone give me a quick rundown of all of the possible "special tags" and what each one of them does (or point me to a resource)?The official name is "server-side scripting delimiters" or "ASP.NET inline expressions". Visual Studio 2008 syntax highlighting settings dialog calls these "HTML Server-Side Script". Microsoft guys call them "code nuggets" in their blogs.There is also a Code Declaration Block, the final Embedded Code Block form.This is used to include additional members (methods etc.) to the class generated from the ASP.NET markup. These have only ever been provided "primarily to preserve backward compatibility with older ASP technology" and are not recommended for use.I have always found this QuickStart page to be very useful, whenever I have a doubt about Server-side syntax. It details 8 different markup styles and provides illustrative examples of each one, in addition to explaining the pros and cons.It doesn\'t mention the Page level directive, though, which IIRC is detailed elsewhere in the Quickstart.Of course, this is relevant to ASP.NET 2.0.No answer for your name question, but the MSDN "ASP.NET Page Syntax" page is pretty good (or rather, that\'s the top level page; the pages under it give more information).EDIT: I had previously thought that <%# ... %> wasn\'t included in the list, but of course it is, under Data-Binding Expressions. Doh.Microsoft guys call them "nuggets" or "code nuggets" sometimes.I\'ve also heard these called "V stings," including on the StackOverflow Podcast.
