What\'s the difference between specifying a background color using background and background-color?Snippet #1Snippet #2Premising that those are two distinct properties, in your specific example there\'s no difference in the result, since background actually is a shortcut forbackground-color\n  background-image\n  background-position\n  background-repeat\n  background-attachment\n  background-clip\n  background-origin\n  background-size Thus, besides the background-color, using the background shortcut you could also add one or more values without repeating any other  background-* property more than once.Which one to choose is essentially up to you, but it could also depend on specific conditions of your style declarations (e.g if you need to override just the background-color when inheriting other related background-* properties from a parent element, or if you need to remove all the values except the background-color).background will supercede all previous background-color, background-image, etc. specifications. It\'s basically a shorthand, but a reset as well.I will sometimes use it to overwrite previous background specifications in template customizations, where I would want the following:background: white url(images/image1.jpg) top left repeat;to be the following:background: black;So, all parameters (background-image, background-position, background-repeat) will reset to their default values.About CSS performance :background vs background-color :Comparison of 18 color swatches rendered 100 times on a page as small\n  rectangles, once with background and once with background-color.While these numbers are from a single page reload, with subsequent\n  refreshes the render times changed, but the percent difference was\n  basically the same every time.That\'s a savings of almost 42.6ms, almost twice as fast, when using\n  background instead of background-color in Safari 7.0.1. Chrome 33\n  appears to be about the same.This honestly blew me away because for the longest time for two reasons:Ref : https://github.com/mdo/css-perf#background-vs-background-colorWith background you can set all background properties like:With background-color you can just specify the color of the backgroundVS.(See Caption: Background - Shorthand property)One of the difference:If you use a image as background in this way:then you cannot override it with "background-color" property.But if you are using background to apply a color, it is same as background-color and can be overriden.eg: http://jsfiddle.net/Z57Za/11/ and http://jsfiddle.net/Z57Za/12/There is no difference. Both will work in the same way.CSS background properties are used to define the background effects of\n    an element.CSS properties used for background effects:Background property includes all of this properties and you can just write them in one line.They\'re both the same.  There are multiple background selectors (i.e. background-color, background-image, background-position) and you can access them either through the simpler background selector or the more specific one. For example:orThe difference is that the background shorthand property sets several background-related properties. It sets them all, even if you only specify e.g. a color value, since then the other properties are set to their initial values, e.g. background-image to none.This does not mean that it would always override any other settings for those properties. This depends on the cascade according to the usual, generally misunderstood rules.In practice, the shorthand tends to be somewhat safer. It is a precaution (not complete, but useful) against accidentally getting some unexpected background properties, such as a background image, from another style sheet. Besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s shorter. But you need to remember that it really means \xe2\x80\x9cset all background properties\xe2\x80\x9d.This is the best answer. Shorthand (background) is for reset and DRY (combine with longhand).Comparison of 18 color swatches rendered 100 times on a page as small\n  rectangles, once with background and once with background-color.I recreated the CSS performance experiment and the results are  significantly different nowadays.Chrome 54: 443 (\xc2\xb5s/div)Firefox 49: 162 (\xc2\xb5s/div)Edge 10: 56 (\xc2\xb5s/div)Chrome 54: 449 (\xc2\xb5s/div)Firefox 49: 171 (\xc2\xb5s/div)Edge 10: 58 (\xc2\xb5s/div)As you see - there\'s almost no difference.I\'ve noticed when generating emails for Outlook...You can do some pretty neat stuff once you understand that you can play with inheritance with this. However first let\'s understand something from this doc on background:With CSS3, you can apply multiple backgrounds to elements. These are\n  layered atop one another with the first background you provide on top\n  and the last background listed in the back. Only the last background\n  can include a background color.So when one do:He is setting the background-color to red because red is the last value listed.When one do:Red is the background color once again BUT you will see a gradient.Now the same thing with background-color:The reason this happens is because when we are doing this :The last number sets the background-color.Then in the before we are inheriting from background (then we get the gradient) or background color, then we get red.background is the shortcut for background-color and few other background related stuffs as below:Read the statement below from W3C:The shorthand property for background is background:When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long\n  as the other ones are in this order.There\'s a bug regarding with background and background-colorthe difference of this,\nwhen using background, sometimes when your creating a webpage\nin CSS\nbackground: #fff // can over ride a block of Mask image("top item, text or image"))\nso its better to always use background-color\nfor safe use, in your design if its individualOne thing I\'ve noticed that I don\'t see in the documentation is using \nbackground: url("image.png")short hand like above if the image is not found it sends a 302 code instead of being ignored like it is if you use
