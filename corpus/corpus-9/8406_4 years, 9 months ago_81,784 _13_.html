I added an external framework via cocoapods into my iOS application. How can i remove that library from the project?Remove lib from Podfile, then pod install again.Since the accepted answer\'s side effects have been removed by a script written by Kyle Fuller - deintegrate, I\'ll post the proper workflow here:Install deintegrate and clean: Run deintegrate in the folder of the project: $ pod deintegrateClean:$ pod cleanModify your podfile (delete the lines with the pods you don\'t want to use anymore) and run:$ pod installDone.Remove the library from your PodfileRun pod install on the terminal
