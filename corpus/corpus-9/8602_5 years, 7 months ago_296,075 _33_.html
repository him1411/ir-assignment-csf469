This question already has an answer here:Is it possible in some way to stop or terminate JavaScript in a way that it prevents any further JavaScript-based execution from occuring, without reloading the browser?I am thinking of a JavaScript equivalent of exit() in PHP.Short answer:If you want to know more, keep reading.The expression debugger; in your code, will halt the page execution, and then your browser\'s developer tools will allow you to review the state of your page at the moment it was frozen.Instead of trying to stop everything, let your code handle the error. Read about Exceptions by googling. They are a smart way to let your code "jump" to error handling procedures without using tedious if/else blocks.After reading about them, if you believe that interrupting the whole code is absolutely the only option, throwing an exception that is not going to be "caught" anywhere except in your application\'s "root" scope is the solution:be sure you don\'t have catch() blocks that catch any exception; in this case modify them to rethrow your "FatalError" exception:return; will terminate the current function\'s execution flow.Note: return; works only within a function....you may want to know how to stop asynchronous code as well. It\'s done with clearTimeout and clearInterval. Finally, to stop XHR (Ajax) requests, you can use the xhrObj.abort() method (which is available in jQuery as well).You can make a JavaScript typo :D (thinking outside the box here)Or something like:Something like this might work:Taken from here:http://vikku.info/codesnippets/javascript/forcing-javascript-to-abort-stop-javascript-execution-at-any-time/No.Even if you throw an exception, it will only kill the current event loop. Callbacks passed to setTimeout or DOM/XMLHttpRequest event handlers will still run when their time comes.You can call return early in a function, and at least that function will stop running. You can also just use throw \'\' to cause an error and stop the current process. But these won\'t stop everything. setTimeout and setInterval can make delayed functions and functions that run on a time interval, respectively. Those will continue to run. Javascript events will also continue to work as usual.I do:this way I have 5 seconds to interact with UI and then in stops. Las time I used was when I needed to leave custom tooltip visible, to do some styling changes.If you\'re in a function you can exit it using return; but that doesn\'t stop execution of the parent function that called that function.I am usingreturn false;if I want to abort from JavaScript from running further downwards.The process is tedious, but in Firefox:stop or terminate JavaScript this [in a] way to [that it] prevent[s] any further\n  JavaScript-based execution from occuring, without reloading the browserNotes:  Other browsers have and use different conventions.Define a variable inside the JavaScript function, set this variable to 1 if you want ot execute the function and set it to 0 if you want to stop itI know this is old, but I wanted to do this and I have found, in my opinion, a slightly improved solution of the throw answers. Just temporary supress the error messages and reactivate them later using setTimeout :I found calling alert in browser console does the trick.
