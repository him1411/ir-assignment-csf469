I have registered a trigger on window resize. I want to know how I can trigger the event to be called. For example, when hide a div, I want my trigger function to be called.I found window.resizeTo() can trigger the function, but is there any other solution?Where possible, I prefer to call the function rather than dispatch an event. This works well if you have control over the code you want to run, but see below for cases where you don\'t own the code.In this example, you can call the doALoadOfStuff function without dispatching an event.In your modern browsers, you can trigger the event using:This doesn\'t work in Internet Explorer, where you\'ll have to do the longhand:jQuery has the trigger method, which works like this:And has the caveat:Although .trigger() simulates an event activation, complete with a synthesized event object, it does not perfectly replicate a naturally-occurring event.You can also simulate events on a specific element...With jQuery, you can try to call trigger:A pure JS that also works on IE (from @Manfred comment)Or for angular:I wasn\'t actually able to get this to work with any of the above solutions. Once I bound the event with jQuery then it worked fine as below:justis what I use... unless I misunderstand what you\'re asking for. Combining pomber\'s and avetisk\'s answers to cover all browsers and not causing warnings:window.resizeBy() will trigger window\'s onresize event. This works in both Javascript or VBScript.window.resizeBy(xDelta, yDelta) called like window.resizeBy(-200, -200) to shrink page 200px by 200px.
