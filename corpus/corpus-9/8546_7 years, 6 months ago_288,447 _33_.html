I\'m trying to construct a layout similar to the following:where the bottom is filling the space of the upper row.If this were an actual table, I could easily accomplish this with <td colspan="3">, but as I\'m simply creating a table-like layout, I cannot use <table> tags. Is this possible using CSS?There\'s no simple, elegant CSS analog for colspan.Searches on this very issue will return a variety of solutions that include a bevy of alternatives, including absolute positioning, sizing, along with a similar variety of browser- and circumstance-specific caveats. Read, and make the best informed decision you can based on what you find. There is no colspan in css as far as I know, but there will be column-span for multi column layout in the near future, but since it is only a draft in CSS3, you can check it in here. Anyway you can do a workaround using div and span with table-like display like this.  This would be the HTML:And this would be the css:  The only reason to use this trick is to gain the benefit of table-layout behaviour, I use it alot if only setting div and span width to certain percentage didn\'t fullfil our design requirement.But if you don\'t need to benefit from the table-layout behaviour, then durilai\'s answer would suit you enough.That isn\'t part of the purview of CSS.  colspan describes the structure of the page\'s content, or gives some meaning to the data in the table, which is HTML\'s job.Another suggestion is using flexbox instead of tables altogether. This is a "modern browser" thing of course, but come on, it\'s 2016 ;)At least this might be an alternative solution for those looking for an answer to this nowadays, since the original post was from 2010.Here\'s a great guide: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/You could trying using a grid system like http://960.gs/Your code would be something like this, assuming you\'re using a "12 column" layout:http://www.quackit.com/css/css3/properties/css_column-span.cfmTry adding display: table-cell;  width: 1%; to your table cell element.if you use div and span it will occupy more code size when the datagrid-table row are more in volume. This below code  is checked in all browsersHTML:CSS:You could always position:absolute; things and specify widths.  It\'s not a very fluid way of doing it, but it would work.I\'ve created this fiddle:http://jsfiddle.net/wo40ev18/3/Media Query classes can be used to achieve something passable with duplicate markup. Here\'s my approach with bootstrap:colspan 1 for mobile, colspan 5 for others with CSS doing the work.Easy method I think is with the Bootstrap But if you don\'t want bootstrap in your site, you could get only the grid from bootstrapYou can find the customized only grid from the net
