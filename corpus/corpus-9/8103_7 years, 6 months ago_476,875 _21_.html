I have a query which works fine in MySQL, but when I run it on Oracle I get the following error:SQL Error: ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended\n  00933. 00000 -  "SQL command not properly ended"The query is:That syntax isn\'t valid in Oracle.  You can do this:Or you might be able to do this:(It depends if the inline view is considered updateable by Oracle).Oracle does not support joins in the UPDATE statements.Use this:Merge with where clause worked for me:You need the WHERE clause because columns referenced in the ON clause cannot be updated.As indicated here, the general syntax for the first solution proposed by Tony Andrews is :I think this is interesting especially if you want update more than one field.It works fine oracleThis following syntax works for me.Using description instead of desc for table2,update table1  a set a.col1=\'Y\' \nwhere exists(select 1 from table2 b\nwhere a.col1=b.col1 and a.col2=b.col2)UPDATE (SELECT T.FIELD A, S.FIELD B\n        FROM TABLE_T T INNER JOIN TABLE_S S\n        ON T.ID = S.ID)\nSET B = A;A and B are the alias fields, you don\'t need to point the table.If you have lots of records to update don\'t use nested select as specified in some answers above, it is excruciatingly slow. Use join, so something likeSee this link for more details.\nhttp://geekswithblogs.net/WillSmith/archive/2008/06/18/oracle-update-with-join-again.aspx.Also, ensure that there are primary keys on all the tables you are joining.
