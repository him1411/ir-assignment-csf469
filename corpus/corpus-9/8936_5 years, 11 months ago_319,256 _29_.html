I have a table in PostgreSQL with 22 columns, and I want to add an auto increment primary key.I tried to create a column called id of type BIGSERIAL but pgadmin responded with an error:Does anyone know how to fix this issue?  How do I add a create an auto-incrementing primary key in PostgreSQL without recreating the table again?Try this command:Try it with the same DB-user as the one you have created the table.Step 1, create your table:Step 2, insert values into your table like this, notice that mytable_key is not specified in the first parameter list, this causes the default sequence to autoincrement.Step 3, select * from your table:Step 4, interpret the output:Observe that mytable_key column has been auto incremented.ProTip:You should always be using a primary key on your table because postgresql internally uses hash table structures to increase the speed of inserts, deletes, updates and selects.  If a primary key column (which is forced unique and non-null) is available, it can be depended on to provide a unique seed for the hash function.  If no primary key column is available, the hash function becomes inefficient as it selects some other set of columns as a key.Create an auto incrementing primary key in postgresql, using a custom sequence:Step 1, create your sequence:Step 2, create your tableStep 3, insert into your tableStep 4, observe the rowsThe two rows have keys that start at 1 and are incremented by 1, as defined by the sequence.Bonus Elite ProTip:Programmers hate typing, and typing out the nextval(\'splog_adfarm_seq\') is annoying.  You can type DEFAULT for that parameter instead, like this:For the above to work, you have to define a default value for that key column on splog_adfarm table.  Which is prettier.If you want to do this in pgadmin, it is much easier. It seems in postgressql, to add a auto increment to a column, we first need to create a auto increment sequence and add it to the required column.  I did like this.1) Firstly you need to make sure there is a primary key for your table. Also keep the data type of the primary key in bigint or smallint. (I used bigint, could not find a datatype called serial as mentioned in other answers elsewhere)2)Then add a sequence by right clicking on sequence-> add new sequence.\n If there is no data in the table, leave the sequence as it is, don\'t make any changes. Just save it.\nIf there is existing data, add the last or highest value in the primary key column to the Current value in Definitions tab as shown below.\n3)Finally, add the line nextval(\'your_sequence_name\'::regclass) to the Default value in your primary key as shown below. \nMake sure the sequence name is correct here. This is all and auto increment should work.Maybe I\'m a bit of late to answer this question, but I\'m working on this subject at my job :) I wanted to write column \'a_code\' = c1,c2,c3,c4...Firstly I opened a column with the name ref_id and the type serial.\nThen I solved my problem with this command:
