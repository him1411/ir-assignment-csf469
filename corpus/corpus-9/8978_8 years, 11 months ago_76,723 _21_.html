Can someone define what exactly \'POCO\' means? I am encountering the term more and more often, and I\'m wondering if it is only about plain classes or it means something more?"Plain Old C# Object"Just a normal class, no attributes describing infrastructure concerns or other responsibilities that your domain objects shouldn\'t have.EDIT - as other answers have stated, it is technically "Plain Old CLR Object" but I, like David Arno comments, prefer "Plain Old Class Object" to avoid ties to specific languages or technologies.TO CLARIFY:  In other words, they don\xe2\x80\x99t derive from \nsome special base class, nor do they return any special types for their properties.Most people have said it - Plain Old CLR Object (as opposed to the earlier POJO - Plain Old Java Object)The POJO one came out of EJB, which required you to inherit from a specific parent class for things like value objects (what you get back from a query in an ORM or similar), so if you ever wanted to move from EJB (eg to Spring), you were stuffed. POJO\'s are just classes which dont force inheritance or any attribute markup to make them "work" in whatever framework you are using.POCO\'s are the same, except in .NET.Generally it\'ll be used around ORM\'s - older (and some current ones) require you to inherit from a specific base class, which ties you to that product. Newer ones dont (nhibernate being the variant I know) - you just make a class, register it with the ORM, and you are off. Much easier.POCO stands for "Plain Old CLR Object".To add the the other answers, the POxx terms all appear to stem from POTS (Plain old telephone services).The POX, used to define simple (plain old) XML, rather than the complex multi-layered stuff associated with REST, SOAP etc, was a useful, and vaguely amusing, term. PO(insert language of choice)O terms have rather worn the joke thin.I may be wrong about this.. but anyways, I think POCO is Plain Old Class CLR Object and it comes from POJO plain old Java Object. A POCO is a class that holds data and has no behaviours.Here is an example written in C#:In Java land typically "PO" means "plain old". The rest can be tricky, so I\'m guessing that your example (in the context of Java) is "plain old class object".some other examplesIn .NET a POCO is a \'Plain old CLR Object\'. It is not a \'Plain old C# object\'...Interesting. The only thing I knew that had to do with programming and had POCO in it is the POCO C++ framework. In WPF MVVM terms, a POCO class is one that does not Fire PropertyChanged eventsWhilst I\'m sure POCO means Plain Old Class Object or Plain Old C Object to 99.9% of people here, POCO is also Animator Pro\'s (Autodesk) built in scripting language.
