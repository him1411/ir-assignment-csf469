I wish to test the core class of a plugin by directly referencing the plugin project and instantiating the plugin class. When I create a test Console App project and add a project reference to the plugin project, I get a warning icon (yellow triangle with exclamation mark) next to the reference in the References list. When I instead add a reference to the dll, the assembly build output of the plugin, I get no such warning. What could this warning be trying to tell me?As mentioned in the question\'s comments, differing .NET Framework versions between the projects can cause this. Check your new project\'s properties to ensure that a different default version isn\'t being used.Encountered the same issue with a ASP.Net Web App and two library class projects which needed to be referenced within the Web App.  I had no information provided on why the build failed and the references were invalid.Solution was to ensure all projects had the same Target Framework:In Visual Studio 2015- Right Click project > Properties > Application > Target FrameworkSave, Clean and Rebuild solution.  The project references should no longer appear as yellow warnings and the solution will compile.My Web App was targeting .Net 4.5 whereas the other two dependent library class projects targeted .Net v4.5.2For both of (or all of) the projects that you want to use together:Right click on the project > Properties > Application > Target .NET frameworkMake sure that both of (or all of) your projects are using the same .NET framework version.Reinstall all packages in all projects of the current solution:Check NETFramework of the referred dll & the Project where you are adding the DLL.\nEx: \nDLL     ==> supportedRuntime version="v4.0"\nProject ==> supportedRuntime version="v3.0"You will get  warning icon.\nSolution : Make dll version consistence across. Adding my 2 cents to the @kad81 answer,Go to Visual Studio -> BUILD -> Configuration ManagerIn the "Active Solution Platform" drop down in top right hand corner (mine is VS 2012), if it is "Mixed Platforms", change it to the appropriate platform based upon your reference third party assemblies.Then in each of the project in the list, make sure you select same platform for all the project. (if x86 not exist, then select "", then you can select "x86".)Rebuild the library projects first and then referencing projects. \nHope this helps.It\'s been a long time since this question was asked but if someone is still interested - I recently ran into similar icons. I was compiling a C#.net project using VS 2008. I found VS could not locate the assemblies for those references. When I double clicked VS refreshed the references and removed the icons on some of those[EDIT: which it could NOW locate]. For remaining references, I had to compile the respective assemblies.I had these icons for a different reason. We have one big solution for all our projects (nearly 100). I made a subselection of the projects I was interested in and made a new solution. However the references where project references instead of references to the compiled dll\'s.... After some research I found this link on GitHub which explains this is new behaviour in VS2015. On the GitHub page they explain a workaround for converting project references to binary references.
