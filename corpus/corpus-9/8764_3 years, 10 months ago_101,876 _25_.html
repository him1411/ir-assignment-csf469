Can you tell me when to use these vectorization methods with basic examples? I see that map is a Series method whereas the rest are DataFrame methods. I got confused about apply and applymap methods though. Why do we have two methods for applying a function to a DataFrame? Again, simple examples which illustrate the usage would be great!Thanks!Straight from Wes McKinney\'s Python for Data Analysis book, pg. 132 (I highly recommended this book):Another frequent operation is applying a function on 1D arrays to each column or row. DataFrame\xe2\x80\x99s apply method does exactly this:Many of the most common array statistics (like sum and mean) are DataFrame methods,\n      so using apply is not necessary.Element-wise Python functions can be used, too. Suppose you wanted to compute a formatted string from each floating point value in frame. You can do this with applymap:The reason for the name applymap is that Series has a map method for applying an element-wise function:Summing up, apply works on a row / column basis of a DataFrame, applymap works element-wise on a DataFrame, and map works element-wise on a Series.Adding to the other answers, in a Series there are also map and apply. Apply can make a DataFrame out of a series; however, map will just put a series in every cell of another series, which is probably not what you want.Also if I had a function with side effects, such as "connect to a web server", I\'d probably use apply just for the sake of clarity.Map can use not only a function, but also a dictionary or another series. Let\'s say you want to manipulate permutations.TakeThe square of this permutation isYou can compute it using map. Not sure if self-application is documented, but it works in 0.15.1. @jeremiahbuddha mentioned that apply works on row/columns, while applymap works element-wise. But it seems you can still use apply for element-wise computation.... There\'s great information in these answers, but I\'m adding my own to clearly summarize which methods work array-wise versus element-wise. jeremiahbuddha mostly did this but did not mention Series.apply.  I don\'t have the rep to comment.DataFrame.apply operates on entire rows or columns at a time.DataFrame.applymap, Series.apply, and Series.map operate on one\nelement at time.There is a lot of overlap between the capabilities of Series.apply and Series.map, meaning that either one will work in most cases.  They do have some slight differences though, some of which were discussed in osa\'s answer.Just wanted to point out, as I struggled with this for a bitProbably simplest explanation the difference between apply and applymap:apply takes the whole column as a parameter and then assign the result to this columnapplymap takes the separate cell value as a parameter and assign the result back to this cell.NB If apply returns the single value you will have this value instead of the column after assigning and eventually will have just a row instead of matrix.
