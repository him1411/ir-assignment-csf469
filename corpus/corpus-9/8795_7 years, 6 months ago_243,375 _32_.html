I\'m trying to make a system call in Python and store the output to a string that I can manipulate in the Python program.I\'ve tried a few things including some of the suggestions here:Retrieving the output of subprocess.call()but without any luck.In Python 2.7 or Python 3Instead of making a Popen object directly, you can use the subprocess.check_output() function to store output of a command in a string:In Python 2.4-2.6Use the communicate method.out is what you want.Important note about the other answersNote how I passed in the command. The "ntpq -p" example brings up another matter. Since Popen does not invoke the shell, you would use a list of the command and options\xe2\x80\x94["ntpq", "-p"].This worked for me for redirecting stdout (stderr can be handled similarly):If it doesn\'t work for you, please specify exactly the problem you\'re having.Assuming that pwd is just an example, this is how you can do it:See the subprocess documentation for another example and more information.subprocess.Popen: http://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.PopenIn the Popen constructor, if shell is True, you should pass the command as a string rather than as a sequence. Otherwise, just split the command into a list: If you need to read also the standard error, into the Popen initialization, you can set stderr to subprocess.PIPE or to subprocess.STDOUT:This works perfectly for me:for Python 2.7+ the idiomatic answer is to use subprocess.check_output()You should also note the handling of arguments when invoking a subprocess, as it can be a little confusing....If args is just single command with no args of its own (or you have shell=True set), it can be a string.  Otherwise it must be a list.for example... to invoke the ls command, this is fine:so is this:however, if you want to pass some args to the shell command, you can\'t do this:instead, you must pass it as a list:the shlex.split() function can sometimes be useful to split a string into shell-like syntax before creating a subprocesses... \nlike this:In this case you will only have one element in the list.I wrote a little function based on the other answers here:Usage:This was perfect for me. \nYou will get the return code, stdout and stderr in a tuple.For Example:
