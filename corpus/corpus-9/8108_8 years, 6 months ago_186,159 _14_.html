Is there a way to compare 2 DateTime variables in Linq2Sql but to disregard the Time part.The app stores items in the DB and adds a published date. I want to keep the exact time but still be able to pull by the date itself.I want to compare 12/3/89 12:43:34 and 12/3/89 11:22:12 and have it disregard the actual time of day so both of these are considered the same.I guess I can set all the times of day to 00:00:00 before I compare but I actually do want to know the time of day I just also want to be able to compare by date only.I found some code that has the same issue and they compare the year, month and day separately. Is there a better way to do this?try using the Date property on the DateTime Object...For a true comparison, you can use:This is how I do this in order to work with LINQ.If you only use dtOne.Date == dtTwo.Date it wont work with LINQ (Error: The specified type member \'Date\' is not supported in LINQ to Entities)You should use EntityFunctions.TruncateTime with EF < 6.0 and DbFunctions.TruncateTime in EF > 6.0 around any DateTime property you want to use inside your Linq.ExampleThe diff value represents the number of days for the age.  If the value is negative the start date falls after the end date.  This is a good check.You can use this if you are using nullable DateFields.In your join or where clause, use the Date property of the column. Behind the scenes, this executes a CONVERT(DATE, <expression>) operation. This should allow you to compare dates without the time.
