I\'m using JQuery as such:However, it appears that if the person manually resizes their browser windows by dragging the window edge to make it larger/smaller, the .resize event above fires multiple times.Question: How to I call a function AFTER the browser window resize completed (so that the event only fires once)?Here\'s a modification of CMS\'s solution that can be called in multiple places in your code:Usage:CMS\'s solution is fine if you only call it once, but if you call it multiple times, e.g. if different parts of your code set up separate callbacks to window resizing, then it will fail b/c they share the timer variable.  With this modification, you supply a unique id for each callback, and those unique IDs are used to keep all the timeout events separate.I prefer to create an event:Here is how you create it:You could have this in a global javascript file somewhere.I use the following function for delaying repeated actions, it will work for your case:Usage:The callback function passed to it, will execute only when the last call to delay has been made after the specified amount of time, otherwise a timer will be reset, I find this useful for other purposes like detecting when the user stopped typing, etc...If you have Underscore.js installed, you could:Some of the previously mentioned solutions did not work for me, even though they are of more general usage. Alternatively I\'ve found this one that did the job on window resize:Many thanks to David Walsh, here is a vanilla version of underscore debounce.Code:Simple usage:Ref: http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-functionSee this answer: javascript resize event firing multiple times while dragging the resize handleIt involves the use of timeouts to delay the execution of your function.Actually, as I know, you can\'t do some actions exactly when resize is off, simply because you don\'t know future user\'s actions. But you can assume the time passed between two resize events, so if you wait a little more than this time and no resize is made, you can call your function.\nIdea is that we use setTimeout and it\'s id in order to save or delete it. For example we know that time between two resize events is 500ms, therefore we will wait 750ms.Simple jQuery plugin for delayed window resize event.Add new function to resize eventRemove the function(by declaring its ID) added earlierRemove all functionsUSAGE OUTPUT:Assuming that the mouse cursor should return to the document after window resize, we can create a callback-like behavior with onmouseover event. Don\'t forget that this solution may not work for touch-enabled screens as expected.Have a look at this CSS-Tricks article. They make use of a feature called debounce. It only executes when the window resize stops.CSS-Tricks Article LinkIt work for me.\nSee this solution - https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/firing-resize-event-only-once-when-resizing-is-finished/
