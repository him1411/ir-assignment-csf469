Is there a way to delete the newline at the end of a line in Vim, so that the next line is appended to the current line?For example:I\'d like to put this all on one line without copying lines and pasting them into the previous one.  It seems like I should be able to put my cursor to the end of each line, press a key, and have the next line jump onto the same one the cursor is on.End result:Is this possible in Vim?If you are on the first line, pressing (upper case) J will join that line and the next line together, removing the newline. You can also combine this with a count, so pressing 3J will combine all 3 lines together.Certainly. Vim recognizes the \\n character as a newline, so you can just search and replace.\nIn command mode type:While on the upper line in normal mode, hit Shift+j.You can prepend a count too, so 3J on the top line would join all those lines together.J deletes extra leading spacing (if any), joining lines with a single space.  (With some exceptions: after /[.!?]$/, two spaces may be inserted; before /^\\s*)/, no spaces are inserted.)If you don\'t want that behavior, gJ simply removes the newline and doesn\'t do anything clever with spaces at all.All of the following assume that your cursor is on the first line:Using normal mappings:3Shift+JUsing Ex commands:Which is an abbreviation ofWhich can also be entered by the following shortcut:3:jAn even shorter Ex command:In vim:It probably depends on your settings, but I usually do this with A<delete>Where A is append at the end of the line. It probably requires nocompatible mode :)cursor in first lineNOW, in NORMAL MODE door:normal V2jJin your .vimrc will allow you to use backspace and delete on \\n (newline) in insert mode.will allow you to delete the previous LF in normal mode with X (when in col 1).I would just press A (append to end of line, puts you into insert mode) on the line where you want to remove the newline and then press delete.if you don\'t mind using other shell tools,The problem is that multiples char 0A (\\n) that are invisible may accumulate.\nSupose you want to clean up from line 100 to the end:Typing ESC and : (terminal commander)In a vim script:Explanation: from 110 till the end\nsearch for lines that start with new line (are blank) \nand remove them
