In MySQL, I have a table, and I want to set the auto_increment value to 5 instead of  1.  Is this possible and what query statement does this?You can use ALTER TABLE to change the auto_increment initial value:See the MySQL reference for more details.Yes, you can use the ALTER TABLE t AUTO_INCREMENT = 42 statement. However, you need to be aware that this will cause the rebuilding of your entire table, at least with InnoDB and certain MySQL versions. If you have an already existing dataset with millions of rows, it could take a very long time to complete.In my experience, it\'s better to do the following:In this way, even if you\'re rolling back the transaction, MySQL will keep the auto-increment value, and the change will be applied instantly.You can verify this by issuing a SHOW CREATE TABLE t statement. You should see:This auto increments the id column by one starting at 10.This auto increments the id column by 5 each time, starting at 10.Procedure to auto fix AUTO_INCREMENT value of tableIf you need this procedure for variable fieldnames instead of id this might be helpful:just export the table with data ..\nthen copy its sql likenow change auto increment value and execute sql.
