Are trailing commas standard in JavaScript, or do most browsers like Chrome and Firefox just tolerate them?I thought they were standard, but IE8 puked after encountering one\xe2\x80\x94of course IE not supporting something hardly means it\xe2\x80\x99s not standard.Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example of what I mean (after the last element of the books array):Specs: ECMAScript 5 and ECMAScript 3Section 11.1.5 in the ECMAScript 5 specification: So yes, it is part of the specification. Update: Apparently this is new in ES5. In ES3 (page 41), the definition was just:For arrays literals (Section 11.1.4) it is even more interesting (Update: this already existed in ES3):(where Elision_opt is Elisionopt, meaning the Elision is optional)Elision is defined as So, an array literal like is perfectly legal. This creates an array with two elements but sets the array length to 2 + 3 = 5.Don\'t expect too much from IE (before IE9)...Just a quick reminder/warning that this is one of the areas in which the JavaScript/ECMAScript standard and JSON standard differ; trailing commas are valid in JS but not valid in JSON.What is even funnier, IE7 giveswhile Firefox and ChromeYou can find the specification for javascript (aka ECMA Script) here.  You can find the relevant definition for arrays on page 63 and as Felix noted, the object definition a couple of pages later on page 65.While this specification says it is fine to have a trailing , I don\'t know if that would be true looking back a few versions.  As you\'ve noted IE8- will crap itself if you leave a trailing comma but Chrome and FF handle it fine.On Chrome 52 :I just don\'t like trailing commas.
