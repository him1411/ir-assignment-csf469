I\'m looking for a stand-alone full-text search server with the following properties:The alternatives I\'ve found that have these properties are:My questions:I\'ve been using Solr successfully for almost 2 years now, and have never used Sphinx, so I\'m obviously biased. \nHowever, I\'ll try to keep it objective by quoting the docs or other people. I\'ll also take patches to my answer :-)Similarities:Here are some differences:Related questions:Unless you need to extend the search functionality in any proprietary way, Sphinx is your best bet.Sphinx advantages:Solr advantages: Note: There are many users with the same question in mind.So, to answer to the point:Which and why? Use Solr if you intend to use it in your web-app(example-site search engine). It will definitely turn out to be great, thanks to its API. You will definitely need that power for a web-app.Use Sphinx if you want to search through tons of documents/files real quick. It indexes real fast too. I would recommend not to use it in an app that involves JSON or parsing XML to get the search results. Use it for direct dB searches. It works great on MySQL.AlternativesAlthough these are the giants, there are plenty more. Also, there are those that use these to power their custom frameworks. So, i would say that you really haven\'t missed any. Although there is one elasticsearch that has a good user base.I have been using Sphinx for almost a year now, and it has been amazing.\nI can index 1.5 million documents in about a minute on my MacBook, and even quicker on the server. I am also using Sphinx to limit searches to places within specific latitudes & longitudes, and it is very fast.\nAlso, how results are ranked is very tweakable.\nEasy to install & setup, if you read a tutorial or two.\nAlmost 1.0 status, but their Release Candidates have been rock solid.Lucene / Solr appears to be more featured and with longer years in business and a much stronger user community.\nimho if you can get past the initial setup issues as some seems to have faced (not we) then I would say Lucene / Solr is your best bet.
