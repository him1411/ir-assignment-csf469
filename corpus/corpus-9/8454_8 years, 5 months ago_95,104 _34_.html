Is there an easy way to run a single migration? I don\'t want to migrate to a certain version I just want to run a specific one.You can just run the code directly out of the ruby file:Note: newer versions of rails may require AddFoos.new.up rather than AddFoos.up.An alternative way (without IRB) which relies on the fact that require returns an array of class names:Note that if you do this, it probably won\'t update the schema_migrations table, but it seems like that\'s what you want anyway.Assuming fairly recent version of Rails you can always run:Where version is the timestamp in the filename of the migration.Edit: At some point over the last 8 years (I\'m not sure what version) Rails added checks that prevent this from running if it has already been run.  This is indicated by an entry in the schema_migrations table.  To re-run it, simply delete that row and then this will work.If you want to run a specific migration, doIf you want to run migrations multiple times, doIf you want to run a single migration multiple times, do(you can find the version number in the filename of your migration)Edit: You can also simply rename your migration file, Eg: 20151013131830_my_migration.rb -> 20151013131831_my_migration.rbThen migrate normally, this will treat the migration as a new one (usefull if you want to migrate on a remote environment (such as staging) on which you have less control.Edit 2: You can also just nuke the migration entry in the database. Eg:rake db:migrate will then rerun the up method of the nuked migrations.If you\'ve implemented a change method like this:You can create an instance of the migration and run migrate(:up) or migrate(:down) on an instance, like this:This are the steps to run again this migration file "20150927161307_create_users.rb"Copy and past the class which is in that file to the console.Create an instance of the class CreateUsers: c1 = CreateUsers.newIf you\'re having trouble with paths you can useAs of rails 5 you can also use rails instead of rakeRails 3 - 4Rails 5 Please notice that instead of script/runner, you may have to use rails runner on new rails environments.Method 1 :Method 2: In Rails Console\n 1. Copy paste the migration class in console (say add_name_to_user.rb)\n 2. Then in console, type the followingIt is done!!Is this something that you ran once as a migration because it happened to be needed, then turns out to be a useful query that might need to get run a number of times?perhaps you should refactor the contents of the migration into a model or other object, then have the migration reference that new location.Then you can simply execute the new object at your lesure by invoking ruby on the command line.
