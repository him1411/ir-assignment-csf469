Let\'s say I have, or am going to write, a set of related functions. Let\'s say they\'re math-related. Organizationally, should I:Why would I choose one over the other as a means of organizing my software?By default, use namespaced functions.Classes are to build objects, not to replace namespaces.Scott Meyers wrote a whole Item for his Effective C++ book on this topic, "Prefer non-member non-friend functions to member functions". I found an online reference to this principle in an article from Herb Sutter: http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/084.htmThe important thing to know is that: In C++ functions in the same namespace as a class belong to that class\' interface (because ADL will search those functions when resolving function calls).Namespaced functions, unless declared "friend," have no access to the class\' internals, whereas static methods have.This means, for example, that when maintaining your class, if you need to change your class\' internals, you will need to search for side effects in all its methods, including the static ones.Adding code to a class\' interface.In C#, you can add methods to a class even if you have no access to it. But in C++, this is impossible.But, still in C++, you can still add a namespaced function, even to a class someone wrote for you.See from the other side, this is important when designing your code, because by putting your functions in a namespace, you will authorize your users to increase/complete the class\' interface.A side-effect of the previous point, it is impossible to declare static methods in multiple headers. Every methods must be declared in the same class.For namespaces, functions from the same namespace can be declared in multiple headers (the almost-standard swap function is the best example of that).The basic cooless of a namespace is that in some code, you can avoid mentioning it, if you use the keyword "using":And you can even limit the "pollution" to one class:This "pattern" is mandatory for proper use of the almost-standard swap idiom.And this is impossible to do with static methods in classes.So, C++ namespaces have their own semantics.But it goes further, as you can combine namespaces in a way similar to inheritance.For example, if you have a namespace A with a function AAA, a namespace B with a function BBB, you can declare a namespace C, and bring AAA and BBB in this namespace with the keyword using.Namespaces are for namespaces.\nClasses are for classes.C++ was designed so each concept is different, and is used differently, in different cases, as solution to different problems.Don\'t use classes when you need namespaces.And in your case, you need namespaces.There are a lot of people who would disagree with me, but this is how I see it:A class is essentially a definition of a certain kind of object. Static methods should define operations that are intimately tied to that object definition.If you are just going to have a group of related functions not associated with an underlying object or definition of a kind of object, then I would say go with a namespace only. Just for me, conceptually, this is a lot more sensible.For instance, in your case, ask yourself, "What is a MyMath?" If MyMath does not define a kind of object, then I would say: don\'t make it a class.But like I said, I know there are plenty of folks who would (even vehemently) disagree with me on this (in particular, Java and C# developers).Otherwise, use namespaced functions.In response to the comments: yes, static methods and static data tend to be over-used. That\'s why I offered only two, related scenarios where I think they can be helpful. In the OP\'s specific example (a set of math routines), if he wanted the ability to specify parameters - say, a core data type and output precision - that would be applied to all routines, he might do something like:If you don\'t need that, then by all means use a namespace.You should use a namespace, because a namespace has the many advantages over a class:Static members are, in my opinion, very very overused. They aren\'t a real necessity in most cases. Static members functions are probably better off as file-scope functions, and static data members are just global objects with a better, undeserved reputation.I would prefer namespaces, that way you can have private data in an anonymous namespace in the implementation file (so it doesn\'t have to show up in the header at all as opposed to private members). Another benefit is that by using your namespace the clients of the methods can opt out of specifying MyMath::Both namespace and class method have their uses. Namespace have the ability to be spread across files however that is a weakness if you need to enforce all related code to go in one file. As mentioned above class also allows you to create private static members in the class. You can have it in the anonymous namespace of the implementation file however it is still a bigger scope than having them inside the class. One more reason to use class - Option to make use of access specifiers. You can then possibly break your public static method into smaller private methods. Public method can call multiple private methods.
