I\'m updating our app to use the new M Permissions system.\nIt is all working besides the onRequestPermissionsResult(). I need to check a permission on a button press, and if it is successful, send a text message. When I grant permission to do it, the dialog closes, but it doesn\'t trigger the Send Text until I press the button again.I\'ve debugged and set breakpoints in the onRequestPermissionsResult() method but it never goes into it.This method gets called first:And then my callback looks like this:Has anybody ran into a similar issue?\nAppreciate any help with this.\nThanksI ran into the same issue and I just found the solution. When using the Support library, you have to use the correct method calls. For example:If you call ActivityCompat.requestPermissions in a fragment, the onRequestPermissionsResult callback is called on the activity and not the fragment.Hope this helps!You can try this: If you are calling this code from a fragment it has it\'s own requestPermissions method. I believe the problem is that you are calling static method.Pro Tip if you want the onRequestPermissionsResult() in a fragment:\nFragmentCompat.requestPermissions(Fragment fragment, String[] permissions, int requestCode)I encountered this problem too. If you want the activity that handles permissions not in the history/recents, then you will be tempted to change your AndroidManifest.xml entry.If you set the activity that you call requestPermissions or AppCompatActivity.requestPermissions with  in your AndroidManifest.xml then onRequestPermissionsResult() will not be called. This is true if your Activity is derived from Activity or AppCompatActivity. This can be fixed by removing both flags from \'AndroidManifest.xml\' and finishing your activity with finishAndRemoveTask() instead. If you have onRequestPermissionsResult in both activity and fragment, make sure to call super.onRequestPermissionsResult in activity. It is not required in fragment, but it is in activity.I hope it works fineFor Activity :For Fragment :Inside fragment, you need to call:Not:If you are using requestPermissions in fragment, it accepts 2 parameters instead of 3.You should use requestPermissions(permissions, PERMISSIONS_CODE);If for some reason you have extended a custom Activity located in some external library that do not call the super you will need to manually call the Fragment super.onRequestPermissionsResult yourself in your Activity onRequestPermissionsResult.You have the checkPermissions function for pre Marshmallow devices in FragmentCompat.\nI use like this:I have found out that is important where you call android.support.v4.app.Fragment.requestPermissions.If you do it in onCreate(), onRequestPermissionsResult() is never called.Solution: Call it in onActivityCreated();This issue was actually being caused by NestedFragments.\nBasically most fragments we have extend a HostedFragment which in turn extends a CompatFragment. Having these nested fragments caused issues which eventually were solved by another developer on the project.He was doing some low level stuff like bit switching to get this working so I\'m not too sure of the actual final solutionThis will work..If you are calling this code from a fragment it has it\xe2\x80\x99s own requestPermissions method.So basic concept is, If you are in an Activity, then calland if in a Fragment, just callBefore you check everything according to above answers, make sure your request code is not 0!!!check the code of onRequestPermissionsResult() in FragmentActivity.java:You can use requestPermissions(PERMISSIONS, MULTIPLE_PERMISSIONS_CODE);. Do not use FragmentCompat if you are using v4.Based on goodgamerguy\'s answer the solution is:
