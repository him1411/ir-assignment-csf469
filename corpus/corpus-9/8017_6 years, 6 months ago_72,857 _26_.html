Whats the difference (in language a python/django noob can understand) in a view between render(), render_to_response() and direct_to_template()?e.g. from Nathan Borror\'s basic apps examplesBut I\'ve also seenAndWhats the difference, what to use in any particular situation?https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/shortcuts/#renderrender() is a brand spanking new shortcut for render_to_response in 1.3 that will automatically use RequestContext that I will most definitely be using from now on.https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/shortcuts/#render-to-responserender_to_response is your standard render function used in the tutorials and such. To use RequestContext you\'d have to specify context_instance=RequestContext(request)https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/generic-views/#django-views-generic-simple-direct-to-templatedirect_to_template is a generic view that I use in my views (as opposed to in my urls) because like the new render() function, it automatically uses RequestContext and all its context_processors.But direct_to_template should be avoided as function based generic views are deprecated. Either use render or an actual class, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/generic-views-migration/I\'m happy I haven\'t typed RequestContext in a long, long time. Rephrasing Yuri, F\xc3\xa1bio, and Frosts answers for the Django noob (i.e. me) - almost certainly a simplification, but a good starting point?render_to_response() is the "original", but requires you putting context_instance=RequestContext(request) in nearly all the time, a PITA.direct_to_template() is designed to be used just in urls.py without a view defined in views.py but it can be used in views.py to avoid having to type RequestContextrender() is a shortcut for render_to_response() that automatically supplies context_instance=Request....\nIts available in the django development version (1.2.1) but many have created their own shortcuts such as this one, this one or the one that threw me initially, Nathans basic.tools.shortcuts.py Render isSo there is really no difference between render_to_response except it wraps your context making the template pre-processors work.Direct to template is a generic view.There is really no sense in using it here because there is overhead over render_to_response in the form of view function.From django docs: render() is the same as a call to\n  render_to_response() with a\n  context_instance argument that that\n  forces the use of a RequestContext.direct_to_template is something different. It\'s a generic view that uses a data dictionary to render the html without the need of the views.py, you use it in urls.py. Docs hereJust one note I could not find in the answers above. In this code:What the third parameter context_instance actually does? Being RequestContext it sets up some basic context which is then added to user_context. So the template gets this extended context. What variables are added is given by TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS in settings.py. For instance django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth adds variable user and variable perm which are then accessible in the template.
