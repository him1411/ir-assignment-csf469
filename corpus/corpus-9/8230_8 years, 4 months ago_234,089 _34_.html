Can anyone suggest to me how I can pass a parameter to a thread?Also, how does it work for anonymous classes?You need to pass the parameter in the constructor to the thread object:and invoke it thus:In response to question edits here is how it works for Anonymous classesYou have a class that extends Thread (or implements Runnable) and a constructor with the parameters you\'d like to pass. Then, when you create the new thread, you have to pass in the arguments, and then start the thread, something like this:Runnable is a much better solution than Thread BTW. So I\'d prefer:This answer is basically the same as this similar question: How to pass parameters to a Thread objectvia constructor of a Runnable or Thread classWhen you create a thread, you need an instance of Runnable. The easiest way to pass in a parameter would be to pass it in as an argument to the constructor:If you then want to change the parameter while the thread is running, you can simply add a setter method to your runnable class:Once you have this, you can change the value of the parameter by calling like this:Of course, if you want to trigger an action when the parameter is changed, you will have to use locks, which makes things considerably more complex.To create a thread you normally create your own implementation of Runnable. Pass the parameters to the thread in the constructor of this class.You can either extend the Thread class or the Runnable class and provide parameters as you want. There are simple examples in the docs. I\'ll port them here:Either write a class that implements Runnable, and pass whatever you need in a suitably defined constructor, or write a class that extends Thread with a suitably defined constructor that calls super() with appropriate parameters.This answer comes very late, but maybe someone will find it useful. It is about how to pass a parameter(s) to a Runnable without even declaring named class (handy for inliners):Of course you can postpone execution of start to some more convenient or appropriate moment. And it is up to you what will be the signature of init method (so it may take more and/or different arguments) and of course even its name, but basically you get an idea.You can derive a class from Runnable, and during the construction (say) pass the parameter in.Then launch it using Thread.start(Runnable r);If you mean whilst the thread is running, then simply hold a reference to your derived object in the calling thread, and call the appropriate setter methods (synchronising where appropriate)Parameter passing via the start() and run() methods:There is a simple way of passing parameters into runnables.\nCode:One further option; this approach lets you use the Runnable item like an asynchronous function call.  If your task does not need to return a result, e.g. it just performs some action you don\'t need to worry about how you pass back an "outcome".This pattern lets you reuse an item, where you need some kind of internal state.  When not passing  parameter(s) in the constructor care is needed to mediate the programs access to parameters.  You may need more checks if your use-case involves different callers, etc.}Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable(parameter));\n   t.start();If you need a result of processing, you will also need to coordinate completion of MyRunnable when the sub-task finishes.  You could pass a call back or just wait on the Thread \'t\', etc.For callback purposes I usually implement my own generic Runnable with input parameter(s):Usage is simple:In manager:No you can\'t pass parameters to the run() method. The signature tells you that (it has no parameters). Probably the easiest way to do this would be to use a purpose-built object that takes a parameter in the constructor and stores it in a final variable: Once you do that - you have to be careful of the data integrity of the object you pass into the \'WorkingTask\'. The data will now exist in two different threads so you have to make sure it is Thread Safe.As of Java 8, you can use a lambda to capture parameters that are effectively final.  For example:
