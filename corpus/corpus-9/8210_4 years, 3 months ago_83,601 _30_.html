I\'m currently running an ec2 micro instance and i\'ve been finding that the instance occasionally runs out of memory.Other than using a larger instance size, what else can be done?A fix for this problem is to add swap or paging space to the instance.Paging works by creating an area on your hard drive and using it for extra memory, this memory is much slower than normal memory however much more of it is available.To add this extra space to your instance you type:If you need more than 1024 then change that to something higher.To enable it by default after reboot, add this line to /etc/fstab:Swap should take place on the Instance Storage (ephemeral) disk and not an EBS device. Swapping will cause a lot of IO and will increase cost on EBS. EBS is also slower than the Instance Store and the Instance Store comes free with certain types of EC2 Instances.It will usually be mounted to /mnt but if not runTo then create a swap file on this device do the following for a 4GB swapfileMake sure no other user can view the swap fileMake and Flag as swapAdd/Make sure the following are in your /etc/fstablastly enable swapAfter applying the steps mentioned by ajtrichards you can check if your amazon free tier instance is using swap using this commandresult:SwapTotal:       1048572 kBSwapFree:        1048572 kBYou can add a 1 GB swap to your instance with these commands:To enable it by default after reboot, add this line to /etc/fstab:If you are on t2 instances (t2.micro, t2.medium, t2.small), there is no ephemeral or instance storage available to you. So you need to just create your swap in EBS which depending on your use case may or maynot be a good idea.\nOtherwise follow @David \'s answer, and create your swap on the ephemeral storage to avoid paying EBS costs. More info: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html there is a table that shows how much ephemeral storage you get for each instance type.You can create swap space using the following steps\nHere we are creating swap at /home/dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=8388608\nHere count is kilobyte count of swap spacemkswap /home/swapfile1vi /etc/fstab\nmake entry :\n/home/swapfile1 swap swap defaults 0 0run:\nswapon -aTry swapspace http://pqxx.org/development/swapspace/Most distros have it packaged.On EC2 you might want to change "swappath" to /mnt or high-iops disk.
