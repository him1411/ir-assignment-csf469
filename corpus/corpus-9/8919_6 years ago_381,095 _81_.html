I am getting this error message when I start Eclipse Helios on Windows 7:Failed to create the Java Virtual MachineMy eclipse.ini looks as follows:My JAVA_HOME is correctly set as far as I can tell. How can I fix this?Why can I not use \'1024m\' for \'-Xmx\' and \'--launcher.XXMaxPermSize\'?Try removing the -vm P:\\Programs\\jdk1.6\\bin lines.Also, a general recommendation: set -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.6, not 1.5.1. Open the eclipse.ini file from your eclipse folder,see the picture below.2.  Open eclipse.ini in Notepad or any other text-editor application, Find the line -Xmx256m (or -Xmx1024m). Now change the default value 256m (or 1024m) to 512m. You also need to give the exact java installed version (1.6 or 1.7 or other).Like This:ORORThen it works well for me.Try to addFYI: Refer sunblogFor others who might have problems with Java 7, as per Eclipse Wiki - eclipse.ini vm_value (windows example)This might not work on all systems. If you encounter "Java was started but returned exit code=1" error while starting the eclipse, modify the -vm argument to point to jvm.dlle.g.Also note that The -vm option must occur before the -vmargs option, since everything after -vmargs is passed directly to the JVMI know this is pretty old now but I have just had the same issue and the problem was I was allocating to much memory to eclipse that it could not get hold of. So open eclipse.ini and lower the amount of memory that is being allocated to -Xmx XXMaxPermSize I changed mine to -Xmx512m and XXMaxPermSize256mOpen the eclipse.ini file from your eclipse folder.It has some of add on configuration . Find the line \xe2\x80\x93launcher.XXMaxPermSize. Now remove the the default value 256m and save it.I removed eclipse.ini. I encountered this issue and removing the ini file solved it.You can also solve this issue by removing the value "256m" under the line "-launcher.XXMaxPermSize\xe2\x80\x9d.Replace -vmargs by your current real path of javaw.exe: *-vm\n\xe2\x80\x9cc:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_07\\bin\\javaw.exe\xe2\x80\x9d*In STS.conf file you need to check two important things to avoid create/allocate jvm issue1. Give the exact jdk install location:2. You need to give the exact java installed version:3. Try to reduce the memory size:After trying the above solution of reducing the memory, Eclipse starts working but hangs every time while loading the plugins from the work-space specially at org.eclipse.debug.core.I found the solution here, Eclipse hangs at Splash Screen, and want share it. Hopefully it can help others as well.I found a very easy solution for this. Just delete eclipse.ini file, but backup first. I had this same problem many times and finally I deleted this and I no more have the problem.It also increased loading time. Now my Eclipse starts faster than earlier.Quick fix:Change -Xmx1024m to -Xmx512m in eclipse.ini (file located at the same level where eclipse.exe is present). And it will work like a charm.This may work:Open eclipse.ini file and paste below lines at the end of the lines.Try this one:This worked for me:I closed all the other memory intensive applications on my WindowsÂ 7 machine. And I tried to open Eclipse, and, voila, it worked.The simple way to fix this problem is just to delete or rename your eclipse.ini file. Try it first. If this method does not resolve your problem, try the solutions described below.Other ways to fix it:Solution 1Add a string into the eclipse.ini file which change a destination of the javaw.exe file. The main thing is that this string must be placed above the string "-vmargs"!Solution 2Remove the value of \xe2\x80\x93launcher.XXMaxPermSize, like 256m.Solution 3Remove or decrease the values of Xms and Xmx:Adding this fixed the issue for me:Some time it\'s not your eclipse.ini; it\'s your JDK which is crashed. You can check it by writing following command in a command prompt:If this command shows the following error: Then first uninstall JDK and reinstall it.Eclipse will be in action again ;) As today I have got the same problem, and \nthe above is suggested by Itachi Uchiha.Reduce param size upto -256After adding -vm in eclipse.ini as shown below worked for me. Add it before -vmargs do not remove itThere was a jdk update which was causing this issue. For me it solved by changing the JDK bin path in the Path environment variable. Put the JDK bin path which has jre/bin/client/jvm.dll under JDK home. STEPS TO SOLVE THE ISSUE :-Open the eclipse.ini file from your eclipse folder.It has some of add on configuration . Find the line \xe2\x80\x93launcher.XXMaxPermSize.It will be the last line in this file. Now remove/delete the the default value 256m and save it.I was facing the same problem, and I found the solution. There are issues in allocation of MaxPermSize. If you try to allocate more than your machine\'s free space then it gives this error in my issue. So try to reduce MaxPermSize.I think it will help you to sort out your issue.@Maro For me it worked very simply!After getting the error message alert, I executed \'eclipsec.exe\' from a command prompt. This opened Eclipse. Then again I tried with \'eclipse.exe\' and now it\'s working nice and well.Unfortunately, it didn\'t give any technical reason for this.In my case this problem occured after updating Java from 1.6 to 1.7.To understand the error, run java.exe in the folder of eclipse.exe. Use parameters from eclipse.ini as it will show which parameter causes the failure.For example:So I changed \'startup\' swith to \'jar\' like below and problem fixed:Go to Task Manager, end all unnecessary tasks, and start Eclipse. You will not get this error. Try it; it worked for me :)One Eclipse window was already opened on my machine and when I tried to open another Eclipse instance, I got this error. I just closed my open Eclipse windows and then launched another. And there was no such error anymore :)After failing with the above proven steps, I tried something after deciding to re-install.Added : %\\USER PATH\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_39\\bin to Environment VariablesDeleted: eclipse configuration file Re-run : eclipsec.exeNow everything from projects is back working.All I had to do was to remove -vm from the eclipse.ini file and return. This time it will tell you where it is looking for javaw.exe so you can go there and delete the symbolic link. Make sure you have JAVA_HOME defined to your jdk path.
