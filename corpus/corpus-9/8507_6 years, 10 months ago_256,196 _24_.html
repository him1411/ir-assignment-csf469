I\'m trying to create a website that can be downloaded and run locally by launching its index file.All the files are local, no resources are used online.When I try to use the AJAXSLT plugin for jQuery to process an XML file with an XSL template (in sub directories), I receive the following errors:XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///C:/path/to/XSL%20Website/data/home.xml. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///C:/path/to/XSL%20Website/assets/xsl/main.xsl. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.The index file making the request is file:///C:/path/to/XSL%20Website/index.html while the JavaScript files used are stored in file:///C:/path/to/XSL%20Website/assets/js/.How can I do to fix this issue?For instances where running a local webserver is not an option, you can allow Chrome access to file:// files via a browser switch. After some digging, I found this discussion, which mentions a browser switch in opening post. Run your Chrome instance with:This may be acceptable for development environments, but little else. You certainly don\'t want this on all the time. This still appears to be an open issue (as of Jan 2011).See also: Problems with jQuery getJSON using local files in ChromeEssentially the only way to deal with this is to have a webserver running on localhost and to serve them from there.It is insecure for a browser to allow an ajax request to access any file on your computer, therefore most browsers seem to treat "file://" requests as having no origin for the purpose of "Same Origin Policy"Starting a webserver can be as trivial as cding into the directory the files are in and running:Here is an applescript that will launch Chrome with the --allow-file-access-from-files switch turned on, for OSX/Chrome devs out there:This solution will allow you to load a local script using jQuery.getScript(). This is a global setting but you can also set the crossDomain option on a per-request basis.What about using the javascript FileReader function to open the local file, ie:Now Click Choose file button and browse to the file file:///C:/path/to/XSL%20Website/data/home.xmlLaunch chrome like so to bypass this restriction: open -a "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --args --allow-file-access-from-files.Derived from Josh Lee\'s comment but I needed to specify the full path to Google Chrome so as to avoid having Google Chrome opening from my Windows partition (in Parallels).You can try putting \'Access-Control-Allow-Origin\':\'*\' in response.writeHead(, {[here]}).The way I just worked around this is not to use XMLHTTPRequest at all, but include the data needed in a separate javascript file instead. (In my case I needed a binary SQLite blob to use with https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/)I created a file called base64_data.js (and used btoa() to convert the data that I needed and insert it into a <div> so I could copy it).and then included the data in the html like normal javascript:I imagine it would be trivial to modify this to read JSON, maybe even XML; I\'ll leave that as an exercise for the reader ;)
