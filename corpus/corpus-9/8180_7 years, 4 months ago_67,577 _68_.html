I would like to have my code run slightly differently when running on the emulator than when running on a device. (For example, using 10.0.2.2 instead of a public URL to run against a development server automatically.) What is the best way to detect when an Android application is running in the emulator?One common one sems to be Build.FINGERPRINT.startsWith("generic")How about this solution:Well Android id does not work for me, I\'m currently using:Based on hints from other answers, this is probably the most robust way:isEmulator = "goldfish".equals(Build.HARDWARE)How about something like the code below to tell if your app was signed with the debug key? it\'s not detecting the emulator but it might work for your purpose?This code works for meIn case that device does not have sim card, It retuns empty string:""Since Android emulator always retuns "Android" as network operator, I use above code.Both the following are set to "google_sdk":So it should be enough to use either one of the following lines.orI tried several techniques, but settled on a slightly revised version of checking the Build.PRODUCT as below.  This seems to vary quite a bit from emulator to emulator, that\'s why I have the 3 checks I currently have.  I guess I could have just checked if product.contains("sdk") but thought the check below was a bit safer.FYI - I found that my Kindle Fire had Build.BRAND = "generic", and some of the emulators didn\'t have "Android" for the network operator.I just look for _sdk, _sdk_ or sdk_, or even just sdk part in Build.PRODUCT:I never found a good way to tell if you\'re in the emulator.but if you just need to detecet if you\'re in a development environment  you can do this :Hope this help....use this function : Don\'t know if there are better ways to detect the emu, but the emulator will have the file init.goldfish.rc in the root-directory. It\'s the emulator specific startup-script, and it shouldn\'t be there on a non-emulator build.Here is my solution (it works only if you run a web server on your debug machine):\nI have created a background task that starts when the application starts. It looks for http://10.0.2.2 and if it exists it changes a global parameter (IsDebug) to true. It is a silent way to find out where you are running.from the main activity onCreate:Another option would be to look at the ro.hardware property and see if its set to goldfish.  Unfortunately there doesn\'t seem to be an easy way to do this from Java but its trivial from C using property_get().The above suggested solution to check for the ANDROID_ID worked for me until I updated today to the latest SDK tools released with Android 2.2.Therefore I currently switched to the following solution which works so far with the disadvantage however that you need to put the PHONE_STATE read permission (<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>)Well, if you want to be hardcore about it and not use any sort of fingerprinting which can be easily modified, I\'ve seen the concepts in this blog post actually coded and working.you can check the IMEI #,\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html#getDeviceId%28%29if i recall on the emulator this return 0. however, there\'s no documentation i can find that guarantees that. although the emulator might not always return 0, it seems pretty safe that a registered phone would not return 0. what would happen on a non-phone android device, or one without a SIM card installed or one that isn\'t currently registered on the network?seems like that\'d be a bad idea, to depend on that.it also means you\'d need to ask for permission to read the phone state, which is bad if you don\'t already require it for something else. if not that, then there\'s always flipping some bit somewhere before you finally generate your signed app.This should return true if the app is running on an emulator.What we should be careful about is not detecting all the emulators because there are only several different emulators. It is easy to check.\nWe have to make sure that actual devices are not detected as an emulator.I used the app called "Android Device Info Share" to check this.On this app, you can see various kinds of information of many devices (probably most devices in the world; if the device you are using is missing from the list, it will be added automatically).Actually, ANDROID_ID on 2.2 always equals 9774D56D682E549C (according to this thread + my own experiments). So, you could check something like this: Not the prettiest, but it does the job. This works for mePut a file in the file system of the emulator; since the file won\'t exist on the real device, this should be stable, reliable and easy to fix when it breaks.From Battery, the emulator:\nPower source is always AC Charger.\nTemperature is always 0.And you can use Build.HOST to record host value, different emulator has different host value.All answers in one methodAll BUILD references are build.prop values, so you have to consider that if you are going to put this into release code, you may have some users with root that have modified theirs for whatever reason. There are virtually no modifications that require using generic as the brand unless specifically trying to emulate the emulator.Fingerprint is the build compile and kernel compile signature. There are builds that use generic, usually directly sourced from Google.On a device that has been modified, the IMEI has a possibility of being zeroed out as well, so that is unreliable unless you are blocking modified devices altogether.Goldfish is the base android build that all other devices are extended from. EVERY Android device has an init.goldfish.rc unless hacked and removed for unknown reasons.I\'ve collected all the answers on this question and came up with function to detect if Android is running on a vm/emulator:Tested on Emulator, Genymotion and Bluestacks (1 October 2015).Whichever code you use to do emulator detection, I\'d highly recommend writing unit tests to cover all the Build.FINGERPRINT, Build.HARDWARE and Build.MANUFACTURER values that you are depending on.  Here are some example tests:...and here\'s our code (debug logs and comments removed for conciseness):Checking the answers, none of them worked when using LeapDroid, Droid4x or Andy emulators,What does work for all cases is the following:I found the new emulator Build.HARDWARE = "ranchu".Reference:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-emulator-dev/dltBnUW_HzUAnd also I found the Android official way to check whether emulator or not.I think it\'s good reference for us.Since Android API Level 23 [Android 6.0]We have ScreenShapeHelper.IS_EMULATOR to check whether emulator.Since Android API Level 24 [Android 7.0]We have Build.IS_EMULATOR to check whether emulator.The way the official to check whether emulator is not new,and also maybe not enough,the answers above also mentioned.But this maybe show us that the official will provide the way of official to check whether emulator or not.As using the above all ways mentioned,right now we can also use the two ways about to check whether emulator.How to access the com.android.internal package and @hideand wait for the official open SDK.Since the underlying emulation engine for Genymotion is VirtualBox and that\'s not going to change any time soon I found the following code the most reliable:
