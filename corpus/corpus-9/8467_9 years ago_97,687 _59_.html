When is it a good idea to use factory methods within an object instead of a Factory class?I like thinking about design pattens in terms of my classes being \'people,\' and the patterns are the ways that the people talk to each other.So, to me the factory pattern is like a hiring agency.  You\'ve got someone that will need a variable number of workers.  This person may know some info they need in the people they hire, but that\'s it.So, when they need a new employee, they call the hiring agency and tell them what they need.  Now, to actually hire someone, you need to know a lot of stuff - benefits, eligibility verification, etc.  But the person  hiring doesn\'t need to know any of this - the hiring agency handles all of that.In the same way, using a Factory allows the consumer to create new objects without having to know the details of how they\'re created, or what their dependencies are - they only have to give the information they actually want.So, now the consumer of the ThingFactory can get a Thing, without having to know about the dependencies of the Thing, except for the string data that comes from the consumer.Factory methods should be considered as an alternative to constructors - mostly when constructors aren\'t expressive enough, ie.is not as expressive as:Factory classes are useful when you need a complicated process for constructing the object, when the construction need a dependency that you do not want for the actual class, when you need to construct different objects etc.One situation where I personally find separate Factory classes to make sense is when the final object you are trying to create relies on several other objects. E.g, in PHP: Suppose you have a House object, which in turn has a Kitchen and a LivingRoom object, and the LivingRoom object has a TV object inside as well. The simplest method to achieve this is having each object create their children on their construct method, but if the properties are relatively nested, when your House fails creating you will probably spend some time trying to isolate exactly what is failing.The alternative is to do the following (dependency injection, if you like the fancy term):Here if the process of creating a House fails there is only one place to look, but having to use this chunk every time one wants a new House is far from convenient. Enter the Factories:Thanks to the factory here the process of creating a House is abstracted (in that you don\'t need to create and set up every single dependency when you just want to create a House) and at the same time centralized which makes it easier to maintain. There are other reasons why using separate Factories can be beneficial (e.g. testability) but I find this specific use case to illustrate best how Factory classes can be useful.It is important to clearly differentiate the idea behind using factory or factory method.\nBoth are meant to address mutually exclusive different kind of object creation problems.Let\'s be specific about "factory method":First thing is that, when you are developing library or APIs which in turn will be used for further application development, then factory method is one of the best selections for creation pattern. Reason behind; We know that when to create an object of required functionality(s) but type of object will remain undecided or it will be decided ob dynamic parameters being passed.Now the point is, approximately same can be achieved by using factory pattern itself but one huge drawback will introduce into the system if factory pattern will be used for above highlighted problem, it is that your logic of crating different objects(sub classes objects) will be specific to some business condition so in future when you need to extend your library\'s functionality for other platforms(In more technically, you need to add more sub classes of basic interface or abstract class so factory will return those objects also in addition to existing one based on some dynamic parameters) then every time you need to change(extend) the logic of factory class which will be costly operation and not good from design perspective.\nOn the other side, if "factory method" pattern will be used to perform the same thing then you just need to create additional functionality(sub classes) and get it registered dynamically by injection which doesn\'t require changes in your base code.They\'re also useful when you need several "constructors" with the same parameter type but with different behavior. It is good idea to use factory methods inside object when:It is good idea to use abstract factory class when:It\'s really a matter of taste. Factory classes can be abstracted/interfaced away as necessary, whereas factory methods are lighter weight (and also tend to be testable, since they don\'t have a defined type, but they will require a well-known registration point, akin to a service locator but for locating factory methods).Factory classes are useful for when the object type that they return has a private constructor, when different factory classes set different properties on the returning object, or when a specific factory type is coupled with its returning concrete type. WCF uses ServiceHostFactory classes to retrieve ServiceHost objects in different situations. The standard ServiceHostFactory is used by IIS to retrieve ServiceHost instances for .svc files, but a WebScriptServiceHostFactory is used for services that return serializations to JavaScript clients. ADO.NET Data Services has its own special  DataServiceHostFactory and ASP.NET has its  ApplicationServicesHostFactory since its services have private constructors.If you only have one class that\'s consuming the factory, then you can just use a factory method within that class.Let\'s understand difference between Factory and FactoryMethod with an exampleoutput:Factory:Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.FactoryMethodDefine an interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclassesIn above example, getArea() is Factory method in Shape interface.\nRectangle and Square are sub-classes of Shape interface.Key notes:Use case:When to use: Client doesn\'t know what concrete classes it will be required to create at runtime, but just wants to get a class that will do the job.Have a look at related SE question to understand structure of these patterns : What is the basic difference between the Factory and Abstract Factory Patterns?The only deviation from class diagram of Factory Method and current example : getShape() has been defined as static method in ShapeFactory. If we follow the pattern strictly, we should have one AbstractShapeFactory with a abstract method getShape() and concrete ShapeFactory return relevant Shape by providing implementation for   getShape() method.Consider a scenario when you have to design an Order and Customer class. For simplicity and initial requirements you do not feel need of factory for Order class and fill your application with many \'new Order()\' statements. Things are working well.Now a new requirement comes into picture that Order object cannot be instantiated without Customer association (new dependency). Now You have following considerations.1- You create constructor overload which will work only for new implementations. (Not acceptable).\n2- You change Order() signatures and change each and every invokation. (Not a good practice and real pain).Instead If you have created a factory for Order Class you only have to change one line of code and you are good to go. I suggest Factory class for almost every aggregate association. Hope that helps.According to sourcemaking website, it\'s intentions are:Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.Defining a "virtual" constructor.The new operator considered harmful.An example of how it can be used:And then the testing:Factory classes are more heavyweight, but give you certain advantages. In cases when you need to build your objects from multiple, raw data sources they allow you to encapsulate only the building logic (and maybe the aggregation of the data) in one place. There it can be tested in abstract without being concerned with the object interface.I have found this a useful pattern, particularly where I am unable to replace and inadequate ORM and want to efficiently instantiate many objects from DB table joins or stored procedures.I\'m quoting from the book PHP Masters. The factory pattern is perfect for instantiating one of many variants in a driver-based-setup, such as different storage engines for your configuration, session, or cache. The biggest value in the factory pattern is that it can encapsulate what would normally be a lot of object setup into a single, simple method call. For example, when setting up a logger object, you need to set up the log type (file-based, MySQL, or SQLite, for example), log location, and potentially, items like credentials. The factory pattern is used to augment the new operator when you\'re instantiating objects, and lets you unify the complexities that might occur in setting up an object, or many types of similar objects. I liken factories to the concept of libraries. For example you can have a library for working with numbers and another for working with shapes. You can store the functions of these libraries in logically named directories as Numbers or Shapes. These are generic types that could include integers, floats, dobules, longs or rectangles, circles, triangles, pentagons in the case of shapes.The factory petter uses polymorphism, dependency injection and Inversion of control.The stated purpose of the Factory Patterns is: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.So let\'s say that you are building an Operating System or Framework and you are building all the discrete components.Here is a simple example of the concept of the Factory Pattern in PHP. I may not be 100% on all of it but it\'s intended to serve as a simple example. I am not an expert.AbstractFactory example.if you want to create a different object in terms of using. It is useful.
