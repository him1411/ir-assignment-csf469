The above doesn\'t seem to work. The records are still there. Can someone fix?If you don\'t feel like iterating, try FBFriendModel.find({ id:333 }).remove( callback ); or FBFriendModel.find({ id:333 }).remove().exec();mongoose.model.find returns a Query, which has a remove function.As of "mongoose": ">=2.7.1" you can remove the document directly with the .remove() method rather than finding the document and then removing it which seems to me more efficient and easy to maintain.See example:UPDATE:As of mongoose 3.8.1, there are several methods that lets you remove directly a document, say:Refer to mongoose API docs for further information.docs is an array of documents. so it doesn\'t have a mongooseModel.remove() method.You can iterate and remove each document in the array separately.Or - since it looks like you are finding the documents by a (probably) unique id - use findOne instead of find.This for me is the best as of version 3.8.1:And it requires only one DB call. \nUse this given that you don\'t perform any remove actions pior to the search and removal.Simply domongoose.model.find() returns a Query Object which also has a remove() function.You can use mongoose.model.findOne() as well, if you want to remove only one unique document.Else you can follow traditional approach as well where you first retrieving the document and then remove.Following are the ways on model object you can do any of the following to remove document(s):yourModelObj.findByIdAndRemove(id, options, callback)yourModelObj.remove(conditions, callback);To generalize you can use:Another way to achieve this is:Ref: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.removeBe careful with findOne and remove!The code above removes ALL users named \'Alice\' instead of the first one only.By the way, I prefer to remove documents like this:Or provide a callback and omit the exec().remove() works like .find():For removing document, I prefer using Model.remove(conditions, [callback])Please refer API documentation for remove :-http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.removeFor this case, code will be:-If you want to remove documents without waiting for a response from MongoDB, do not pass a callback, then you need to  call exec on the returned Query You can just use the query directly within the remove function, so:If you are looking for only one object to be removed, you can use In this example, Mongoose will delete based on matching req.params.id. I prefer the promise notation, where you need e.g.You can always use Mongoose built-in function:using remove() method you can able to remove.Works for any mongoose version I\'ve used
