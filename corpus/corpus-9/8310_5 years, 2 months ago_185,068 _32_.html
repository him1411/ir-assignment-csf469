How can I integrate the new Google Cloud Messaging in a PHP backend?This code will send a GCM message to multiple registration IDs via PHP CURL. It\'s easy to do. The cURL code that\'s on the page that Elad Nava has put here works. Elad has commented about the error he\'s receiving.String describing an error that occurred while processing the message for that recipient. The possible values are the same as documented in the above table, plus "Unavailable" (meaning GCM servers were busy and could not process the message for that particular recipient, so it could be retried).I\'ve got a service set up already that seems to be working (ish), and so far all I\'ve had back are unavailable returns from Google. More than likely this will change soon.To answer the question, use PHP, make sure the Zend Framework is in your include path, and use this code:And there we have it. A working (it will work soon) example of using Googles new GCM in Zend Framework PHP.After searching for a long time finally I am able to figure out what I exactly needed, Connecting to the GCM using PHP as a server side scripting language, The following tutorial will give us a clear idea of how to setup everything we need to get started with GCMAndroid Push Notifications using Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), PHP and MySQLI actually have this working now in a branch in my Zend_Mobile tree: https://github.com/mwillbanks/Zend_Mobile/tree/feature/gcmThis will be released with ZF 1.12, however, it should give you some great examples on how to do this.Here is a quick demo on how it would work....Also you can try this piece of code, source:A lot of the tutorials are outdated, and even the current code doesn\'t account for when device registration_ids are updated or devices unregister. If those items go unchecked, it will eventually cause issues that prevent messages from being received.  http://forum.loungekatt.com/viewtopic.php?t=63#p181In above script just change :"YOURKEY" to API key to Server Key of API console.\n  "REGISTERED_ID" with your device\'s registration ID\n  "COLLAPSE_KEY" with key which you required\n  "MESSAGE" with message which you want to sendLet me know if you are getting any problem in this I am able to get notification successfully using the same script.You can use this PHP library available on packagist:https://github.com/CoreProc/gcm-phpAfter installing it you can do this:Here\'s a library I forked from CodeMonkeysRU.The reason I forked was because Google requires exponential backoff. I use a redis server to queue messages and resend after a set time.I\'ve also updated it to support iOS.https://github.com/stevetauber/php-gcm-queueHere is android code for PHP code of above posted by @Elad NavaMainActivity.java (Launcher Activity)GCMClientManager.javaPushNotificationService.java (Notification generator)AndroidManifest.xmluse this
