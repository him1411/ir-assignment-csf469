I have this model in Ruby but it throws a ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesErrorwhen I run this actionon ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-linux].Can you please tell me how to get rid of this error or establish a proper user registration form?I guess you are using Rails 4. If so, the needed parameters must be marked as required.You might want to do it like this:For those using CanCan. People might be experiencing this if they use CanCan with Rails 4+. Try AntonTrapps\'s rather clean workaround solution here until CanCan gets updated:In the ApplicationController:and in the resource controller (for example NoteController):Update:Here\'s a continuation project for CanCan called CanCanCan, which looks promising:CanCanCanThere is an easier way to avoid the Strong Parameters at all, you just need to convert the parameters to a regular hash, as:This defeats the purpose of strong parameters of course, but if you are in a situation like mine (I\'m doing my own management of allowed params in another part of my system) this will get the job done.If using ActiveAdmin don\'t forget that there is also a permit_params in the model register block:These need to be set along with those in the controller:Otherwise you will get the error:For those using CanCanCan:You will get this error if CanCanCan cannot find the correct params method.For the :create action, CanCan will try to initialize a new instance with sanitized input by seeing if your controller will respond to the following methods (in order):Additionally, load_and_authorize_resource can now take a param_method option to specify a custom method in the controller to run to sanitize input.You can associate the param_method option with a symbol corresponding to the name of a method that will get called:source:\nhttps://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan#strong-parametersAlternatively you can use the Protected Attributes gem, however this defeats the purpose of requiring strong params. However if you\'re upgrading an older app, Protected Attributes does provide an easy pathway to upgrade until such time that you can refactor the attr_accessible to strong params.hello in my case error is fixed but getting empty result is database.}My orginal plugin is\nhttps://github.com/IceskYsl/worklogs
