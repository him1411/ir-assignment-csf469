Trying to call a method in my activity from a fragment. I want the fragment to give the method data and to get the data when the method return. I want to achieve similar to call on a static method, but without the use of static because it create problems in the activity. New to fragments so I need an easy and pedagogic explanation!Thanks!From fragment to activty:From activity to fragment:If you added fragment via code and used a tag string when you added your fragment, use findFragmentByTag instead:You should probably try to decouple the fragment from the activity in case you want to use it somewhere else. You can do this by creating a interface that your activity implements. So you would define an interface like the following:Suppose for example you wanted to give the activity a String and have it return a Integer:This can be defined in the fragment or a separate file. Then you would have your activity implement the interface. Then in your fragment you would have a MyStringListener variable and you would set the listener in fragment onAttach(Activity activity) method. edit(17.12.2015):onAttach(Activity activity) is deprecated, use onAttach(Context context) instead, it works as intendedThe first answer definitely works but it couples your current fragment with the host activity. Its good practice to keep the fragment decoupled from the host activity in case you want to use it in another acitivity. Update after I understand more how fragments work. Each fragment belongs to a parent activity. So just use:From within the fragment. It is a better answer because you avoid superflous casts. If you cannot avoid the casts with this solution use the one below.============what you have to do is to cast to the outer activity creating a new instance will be confusing the android frame and it will not be able to recognize it. \nsee also : https://stackoverflow.com/a/12014834/1984636https://stackoverflow.com/a/2042829/1984636Although i completely like Marco\'s Answer i think it is  fair to point out that you can also use a publish/subscribe based framework to achieve the same result for example if you go with the event bus you can do the following fragment  : Activity:For accessing a function declared in your Activity via your fragment please use an interface, as shown in the answer by marco.For accessing a function declared in your Fragment via your activity you can use this if you don\'t have a tag or an idThis is the ViewpagerAdapterClassThis answer is for noobs like me. Have a good day.
