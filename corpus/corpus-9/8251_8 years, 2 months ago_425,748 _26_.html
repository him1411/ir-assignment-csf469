I searched in Google and also visited decimal and numeric and SQL Server Helper to glean the difference between numeric, float and decimal datatypes and also to find out which one should be used in which situation.For any kind of financial transaction (e.g. for salary field), which one is prefered and why?use the float or real data types only if the precision provided by decimal (up to 38 digits) is insufficientApproximate numeric data types do not store the exact values specified for many numbers; they store an extremely close approximation of the value.(Technet)Avoid using float or real columns in WHERE clause search conditions, especially the = and <> operators (Technet)so generally because the precision provided by decimal is [10E38 ~ 38 digits] if your number can fit in it, and smaller storage space (and maybe speed) of Float is not important and dealing with abnormal behaviors and issues of approximate numeric types are not acceptable, use Decimal generally.more useful information \nmain source :  MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-433): Microsoft\xc2\xae SQL Server\xc2\xae 2008 Database Development  - Chapter 3 - Tables , Data Types , and Declarative Data Integrity Lesson 1 - Choosing Data Types (Guidelines) - Page 93 Guidelines from MSDN: Using decimal, float, and real DataThe default maximum precision of numeric and decimal data types is 38.\n  In Transact-SQL, numeric is functionally equivalent to the decimal\n  data type. Use the decimal data type to store numbers with decimals\n  when the data values must be stored exactly as specified.The behavior of float and real follows the\n  IEEE 754 specification on approximate numeric data types. Because of the approximate nature of the float and real data types, do not use these data types when exact\n  numeric behavior is required, such as in financial applications, in\n  operations involving rounding, or in equality checks. Instead, use the\n  integer, decimal, money, or smallmoney data types. Avoid using float\n  or real columns in WHERE clause search conditions, especially the =\n  and <> operators. It is best to limit float and real columns to > or <\n  comparisons. Not a complete answer, but a useful link:"I frequently do calculations against decimal values. In some cases casting decimal values to float ASAP, prior to any calculations, yields better accuracy. "http://sqlblog.com/blogs/alexander_kuznetsov/archive/2008/12/20/for-better-precision-cast-decimals-before-calculations.aspxDecimal and Numeric are the same functionally but there is still data type precedence, which can be crucial in some cases.The resulting data type is numeric because it takes data type precedence.Exhaustive list of data types by precedence:Reference linkDecimal has a fixed precision while float has variable precision.EDIT (failed to read entire question):\nFloat(53) (aka real) is a double-precision (32-bit) floating point number in SQL Server. Regular Float is a single-precision floating point number. Double is a good combination of precision and simplicty for a lot of calculations. You can create a very high precision number with decimal -- up to 136-bit -- but you also have to be careful that you define your precision and scale correctly so that it can contain all your intermediate calculations to the necessary number of digits.Float is Approximate-number data type, which means that not all values in the data type range can be represented exactly.Decimal/Numeric is Fixed-Precision data type, which means that all the values in the data type range can be represented exactly with precision and scale. You can use decimal for money saving.Converting from Decimal or Numeric to float can cause some loss of precision. For the Decimal or Numeric data types, SQL Server considers each specific combination of precision and scale as a different data type. DECIMAL(2,2) and DECIMAL(2,4) are different data types. This means that 11.22 and 11.2222 are different types though this is not the case for float. For FLOAT(6) 11.22 and 11.2222 are same data types.You can also use money data type for saving money. This is native data type with 4 digit precision for money. Most experts prefers this data type for saving money.Reference\n1\n2\n3
