In an android service I have created thread(s) for doing some background task. I have a situation where the thread need to post certain task on main thread\'s message queue, for example a Runnable.Is there a way to get Handler of the main thread and post Message/Runnable to it from my other thread ?Thanks, NOTE: This answer has gotten so much attention, that I need to update it. Since the original answer was posted, the comment from @dzeikei has gotten almost as much attention as the original answer. So here are 2 possible solutions:1. If your background thread has a reference to a Context object:Make sure that your background worker threads have access to a Context object (can be the Application context or the Service context). Then just do this in the background worker thread:2. If your background thread does not have (or need) a Context object(suggested by @dzeikei):As a commenter below pointed correctly, this is not a general solution for services, only for threads launched from your activity (a service can be such a thread, but not all of those are).\nOn the complicated topic of service-activity communication please read the whole Services section of the official doc - it is complex, so it would pay to understand the basics:\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html#NotificationsThe method below may work in simpliest cases.If I understand you correctly you need some code to be executed in GUI thread of the application (cannot think about anything else called "main" thread). \nFor this there is a method on Activity:Doc: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#runOnUiThread%28java.lang.Runnable%29Hope this is what you are looking for.There is another simple way, if you don\'t have an access to the Context.1). Create a handler from the main looper:2). Implement a Runnable interface:3). Post your Runnable to the uiHandler:That\'s all ;-) Have fun with threads, but don\'t forget to synchronize them.If you run code in a thread, e.g. do delaying some action, then you need to invoke runOnUiThread from the context. For example, if your code is inside MainActivity class then use this:If your method can be invoked either from main (UI thread) or from other threads you need a check like:One method I can think of is this:1) Let the UI bind to the service.\n2) Expose a method like the one below by the Binder that registers your Handler:3) In the UI thread, call the above method after binding to the service:4) Use the handler in the Service\'s thread to post your task:
