I have an image element that I want to change on click.This works:But what I need is:But, it doesn\'t work, obviously. Is it possible at all to have onclick behavior in CSS (i.e. without using JavaScript)?The closest you\'ll get is :active:However this will only apply the style when the mouse button is held down. The only way to apply a style and keep it applied onclick is to use a bit of JavaScript.The best way (actually the only way*) to simulate an actual click event using only CSS (rather than just hovering on an element or making an element active, where you don\'t have mouseUp) is to use the checkbox hack. It works by attaching a label to an <input type="checkbox"> element via the label\'s for="" attribute. This feature has broad browser support (the :checked pseudo-class is IE9+).Apply the same value to an <input>\'s ID attribute and an accompanying <label>\'s for="" attribute, and you can tell the browser to re-style the label on click with the :checked pseudo-class, thanks to the fact that clicking a label will check and uncheck the "associated" <input type="checkbox">.* You can simulate a "selected" event via the :active or :focus pseudo-class in IE7+ (e.g. for a button that\'s normally 50px wide, you can change its width while active: #btnControl:active { width: 75px; }), but those are not true "click" events. They are "live" the entire time the element is selected (such as by Tabbing with your keyboard), which is a little different from a true click event, which fires an action on - typically - mouseUp.Here I\'ve positioned the label right after the input in my markup. This is so that I can use the adjacent sibling selector (the + key) to select only the label that immediately follows my #demo checkbox. Since the :checked pseudo-class applies to the checkbox, #demo:checked + label will only apply when the checkbox is checked. With that being said, there is some bad news. Because a label can only be associated with one form control at a time, that means you can\'t just drop a button inside the <label></label> tags and call it a day. However, we can use some CSS to make the label look and behave fairly close to how an HTML button looks and behaves.Most of the CSS in this demo is just for styling the label element. If you don\'t actually need a button, and any old element will suffice, then you can remove almost all of the styles in this demo, similar to my second demo above.You\'ll also notice I have one prefixed property in there, -moz-outline-radius. A while back, Mozilla added this awesome non-spec property to Firefox, but the folks at WebKit decided they aren\'t going to add it, unfortunately. So consider that line of CSS just a progressive enhancement for people who use Firefox.You can use pseudo class :target to mimic on click event, let me give you an example.Here\'s the HTML:And here\'s the CSS:Here\'s how it looks like: http://jsfiddle.net/TYhnb/One thing to note, this is only limited to hyperlink, so if you need to use on other than hyperlink, such as a button, you might want to hack it a little bit, such as styling a hyperlink to look like a button.If you give the element a tabindex then you can use the :focus pseudo class to simulate a click.HTMLCSShttp://jsfiddle.net/NaTj5/Edit: Answered before OP clarified what he wanted. The following is for an onclick similar to javascripts onclick, not the :active pseudo class.This can only be achieved with either Javascript or the Checkbox HackThe checkbox hack essentially gets you to click on a label, that "checks" a checkbox, allowing you to style the label as you wish.The demoTylerH made a really good answer, and I just had to give that last button version an update.Okay, this maybe an old post... but was first result in google and decided to make your own mix on this as..FIRSTLY I WILL USE FOCUSThe reason for this is that it works nicely for the example i\'m showing, if someone wants a mouse down type event then use activeTHE HTML CODE:THE CSS CODE:JS FIDDLE LINK: http://jsfiddle.net/00wwkjux/So why am i posting this in an old thread, well because the examples here vary and i thought to provide one back to the community which is a working example.As already answered by the thread creator, they only want the effect to last during the click event. Now while this is not exact for that need, its close. active will animate while the mouse is down and any changes that you need to have last longer need to be done with javascript.Bojangles answer is generally correct, however:"The only way to apply a style and keep it applied onclick is to use a bit of JavaScript"This is not quite true in the sense of keeping the block visible after the click.  I had a similar situation, I needed a popup div with onClick where I couldn\'t add any JS or change the markup/HTML (a truly CSS solution) and this is possible with some caveats.  You can\'t use the :target trick that can create a nice popup unless you can change the HTML (to add an \'id\') so that was out.In my case the popup div was contained inside the other div, and I wanted the popup to appear on top of the other div, and this can be done using a combination of :active and :hover:Example (as well as one that allows clicking on the popup to make it disappear) at:http://davesource.com/Solutions/20150324.CSS-Only-Click-to-Popup-Div/I have the below code for mouse hover and mouse click and it works:and this code hides the image when you click on it:Not with real css. You can use active like everyone else here has said or you use checkbox/radio hacks but I wouldn\'t recommend it because its limited to siblings.That being said, apparently there is a really cool POSTcss plugin that allows you to write:and it will complie the javascript:
