Is the following shorthand for $(document).ready?I see this pattern used a lot, but I\'m unable to find any reference to it. If it is shorthand for $(document).ready(), is there any particular reason it might not work? In my tests it seems to always fire before the ready event.The shorthand for $(document).ready(handler) is $(handler) (where handler is a function). See here.The code in your question has nothing to do with .ready(). Rather, it is an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) with the jQuery object as its argument. Its purpose is to restrict the scope of at least the $ variable to its own block so it doesn\'t cause conflicts. You typically see the pattern used by jQuery plugins to ensure that $ == jQuery.The shorthand is:The correct shorthand is this:The code you posted\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6creates an anonymous function and executes it immediately with jQuery being passed in as the arg $. All it effectively does is take the code inside the function and execute it like normal, since $ is already an alias for jQuery. :DThis is not a shorthand for $(document).ready().The code you posted boxes the inside code and makes jQuery available as $ without polluting the global namespace. This can be used when you want to use both prototype and jQuery on one page.Documented here: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/#use-an-immediately-invoked-function-expressionThese specific lines are the usual wrapper for jQuery plugins:"...to make sure that your plugin doesn\'t collide with other libraries that might use the dollar sign, it\'s a best practice to pass jQuery to a self executing function (closure) that maps it to the dollar sign so it can\'t be overwritten by another library in the scope of its execution."From http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/AuthoringThe multi-framework safe shorthand for ready is:This is because jQuery isn\'t the only framework that uses the $ and undefined variablesWhat about this?By the way, another shortcut I use all the time (which is basically a version of the one already mentioned)
