What Xcode keyboard shortcuts do you use regularly? I am a huge believer in using the keyboard as much as possible (its much faster that way), and I was hoping others could share some of the Xcode shortcuts they use.I find the shortcuts to open & close various areas of the screen must useful.Cmd + Shift + o opens the "Open quickly" dialog, where you can quickly find and open files that contain the text you enter.Updated for newer versions:Control + Command + ↑Switches between corresponding .h / .m files or as Apple\'s own documentation, it means Jump to Counterpartcommand /Comment out the current line, or multiple lines if they\'re highlighted.Comes in handy for quick commenting and uncommenting while experimenting with code.command + shift + jReveals the current file in the project navigator. Very useful if you use command + control + J to jump to a definition as Xcode won\'t automatically reveal the containing file in the navigator.Re-indent. It\'s in Edit > Format > Re-Indent and there\'s no shortcut by default (I use Command + Shift + L). It\'s a godsend.command F Search in the Fileoption command F Search & Replace in the Fileshift command F Search in the whole projectshift option command F Search & Replace in the whole projectNotice the pattern for easy memorizing.Ctrl + Command + ↑ - Switch between header and implementation files.Command + J\n(Move focus to any section of the editor)Control + Command  + jHighlight a keyword (method name) and jump to its definition. Also works for variables, #defines, etc.Some of my favorite shortcuts are not keyboard shortcuts at all, but multitouch gestures. All Macbooks from early 2008 onward, and I would imagine desktops with a Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad, support three-finger-swipe up and down to switch between the header and implementation, and three-finger-swipe left and right to navigate within the file history.Command +  Shift +  Y for the console.I find a cheat sheet next to the computer is the best way to pick up useful shortcuts. Cocoa Samurai has a good one.Create your own keyboard shortcuts using the Text Key Bindings tab of the Key Bindings preference pane. A time-saver all its own. Just lookup your favourite actions and add/edit shortcuts!Another thread you may find useful is here.Just the basic emacs navigation. Feels so right.I cannot live without three finger vertical swipe to switch between interface and implementation file. If you miss that in xcode-4/Lion, make sure to follow the following instructions:http://geeksinkilts.com/?p=67
