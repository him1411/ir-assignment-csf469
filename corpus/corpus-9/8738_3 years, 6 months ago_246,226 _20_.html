Java 8 added a new API for working with dates and times (JSR 310).I have date and time as string (e.g. "2014-04-08 12:30"). How can I obtain a LocalDateTime instance from the given string?After I finished working with the LocalDateTime object: How can I then convert the LocalDateTime instance back to a string with the same format as shown above?Parsing date and timeTo create a LocalDateTime object from a string you can use the static LocalDateTime.parse() method. It takes a string and a DateTimeFormatter as parameter. The DateTimeFormatter is used to specify the date/time pattern.Formatting date and timeTo create a formatted string out a LocalDateTime object you can use the format() method.Note that there are some commonly used date/time formats predefined as constants in DateTimeFormatter. For example: Using DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE_TIME to format the LocalDateTime instance from above would result in the string "1986-04-08T12:30:00".The parse() and format() methods are available for all date/time related objects (e.g. LocalDate or ZonedDateTime)You can also use LocalDate.parse() or LocalDateTime.parse() on a String without providing it with a pattern, if the String is in ISO-8601 format.for example,Output,and use DateTimeFormatter only if you have to deal with other date patterns,\nFor example, dd MMM uuuu represents the day of the month (two digits), three letters of the name of the month (Jan, Feb, Mar,...), and a four-digit year:Outputalso remember that the DateTimeFormatter object is bidirectional; it can both parse input and format output.Output(see complete list of Patterns for Formatting and Parsing DateFormatter)Both answers above explain very well the question regarding string patterns. However, just in case you are working with ISO 8601 there is no need to apply DateTimeFormatter since LocalDateTime is already prepared for it:Convert LocalDateTime to Time Zone ISO8601 StringConvert from ISO8601 String back to a LocalDateTime
