Is there a container adapter that would reverse the direction of iterators so I can iterate over a container in reverse with range-based for-loop?With explicit iterators I would convert this:into this:I want to convert this:to this:Is there such a thing or do I have to write it myself?Actually Boost does have such adaptor: boost::adaptors::reverse. Actually, in C++14 it can be done with a very few lines of code.This is a very similar in idea to @Paul\'s solution. Due to things missing from C++11, that solution is a bit unnecessarily bloated (plus defining in std smells). Thanks to C++14 we can make it a lot more readable.The key observation is that ranged-based for-loops work by relying on begin() and end() in order to acquire the range\'s iterators. Thanks to ADL, one doesn\'t even need to define their custom begin() and end() in the std:: namespace.Here is a very simple-sample solution:This works like a charm, for instance:prints as expectedNOTE std::rbegin(), std::rend(), and std::make_reverse_iterator() are not yet implemented in GCC-4.9. I write these examples according to the standard, but they would not compile in stable g++. Nevertheless, adding temporary stubs for these three functions is very easy. Here is a sample implementation, definitely not complete but works well enough for most cases:This should work in C++11 without boost:Does this work for you:eg:If not using C++14, then I find below the simplest solution.Demo.\nIt doesn\'t work for the containers/data-types (like array), which doesn\'t have begin/rbegin, end/rend functions.
