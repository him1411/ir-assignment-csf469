I am trying to delete empty lines using sed but i have no luck with it.\nfor example I have this lines:and i want it to be like:what should be the code for this?You may have space/tabs in your "empty" line.  If so, this will help:This uses \\s to match any whitespace character.sed \'/^$/d\' should be fine, are you expecting to modify the file in place? If so you should use the -i flag.Maybe those lines are not empty, so if that\'s the case, look at this question Remove empty lines from txtfiles, remove spaces from start and end of line I believe that\'s what you\'re trying to achieve.I am missing the awk solution:Which would return:How does this work? Since NF stands for "number of fields", those lines being empty have 0 fiedls, so that awk evaluates 0 to False and no line is printed; however, if there is at least one field, the evaluation is True and makes awk perform its default action: print the current line.I believe this is the easiest and fastest one:If you need to ignore all white-space lines as well then try this:Example:outputs\nWith help from the accepted answer here and the accepted answer above, I have used:\n\nThis covers all the bases and works perfectly for my needs.  Kudos to the original posters @Kent and @kev\nYou can say:You can do something like that using "grep", too:This works in awk as well.You are most likely seeing the unexpected behavior because your text file was created on Windows, so the end of line sequence is \\r\\n.  You can use dos2unix to convert it to a UNIX style text file before running sed or usesed -r "/^\\r?$/d"to remove blank lines whether or not the carriage return is there.For me with FreeBSD 10.1 with sed worked only this solution: inside [] there are space and tab symbols.test file contains:
