I have read article at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener but unable to understand useCapture attribute. Definition there is:If true, useCapture indicates that the user wishes to initiate capture. After initiating capture, all events of the specified type will be dispatched to the registered listener before being dispatched to any EventTargets beneath it in the DOM tree. Events which are bubbling upward through the tree will not trigger a listener designated to use capture. In this code parent event triggers before child,so I am not able to understand its \nbehavior.Document object has usecapture true and child div has usecapture set false and document usecapture is followed.So why document property is preferred over child.Events can be activated at two occasions: At the beginning ("capture"), and at the end ("bubble").\n     \nEvents are executed in the order of how they\'re defined. Say, you define 4 event listeners:The alert boxes will pop up in this order:I find this diagram is very useful for understanding the capture/target/bubble phases:\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-DOM-Level-3-Events-20031107/events.html#Events-phasesBelow, content extracted from the link.PhasesThe event is dispatched following a path from the root of the tree to this target node. It can then be handled locally at the target node level or from any target\'s ancestors higher in the tree. The event dispatching (also called event propagation) occurs in three phases and the following order:The target\'s ancestors are determined before the initial dispatch of the event. If the target node is removed during the dispatching, or a target\'s ancestor is added or removed, the event propagation will always be based on the target node and the target\'s ancestors determined before the dispatch.Some events may not necessarily accomplish the three phases of the DOM event flow, e.g. the event could only be defined for one or two phases. As an example, events defined in this specification will always accomplish the capture and target phases but some will not accomplish the bubbling phase ("bubbling events" versus "non-bubbling events", see also the Event.bubbles attribute).Capture Event vs Bubble Event( stopPropagation() will stop the flow )DemoWhen you say useCapture = true the Events execute top to down in the capture phase when false it does a bubble bottom to top.It\'s all about event models: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-flow\nYou can catch event in bubbling phase or in capturing phase. Your choice.\nTake a look at http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html - you\'ll find it very useful.Code example:Javascript code:if both are set to falseExecutes: Onclicking Inner Div, alerts are displayed as:\n Div 2 > Div 1Here the script is executed from the inner element: Event Bubbling (useCapture has been set to false)div 1 is set to true and div 2 set to falseExecutes: Onclicking Inner Div, alerts are displayed as:\n Div 1 > Div 2Here the script is executed from the ancestor / outer element: Event Capturing (useCapture has been set to true)div 1 is set to false and div 2 set to trueExecutes: Onclicking Inner Div, alerts are displayed as:\n Div 2 > Div 1Here the script is executed from the inner element: Event Bubbling (useCapture has been set to false)div 1 is set to true and div 2 set to trueExecutes: Onclicking Inner Div, alerts are displayed as:\n Div 1 > Div 2Here the script is executed from the ancestor / outer element: Event Capturing since useCapture has been set to trueGiven the three phases of event travel:useCapture indicates for which phases the event travel will be on:If true, useCapture indicates that the user wishes to add the event\n  listener for the capture phase only, i.e. this event listener will not\n  be triggered during the target and bubbling phases. If false, the\n  event listener will only be triggered during the target and bubbling\n  phasesSource is the same as the second best answer: https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-DOM-Level-3-Events-20031107/events.html#Events-phasesThe order of definition only matters if the items are at the same level.  If you reverse the order of definition in your code you will get the same results.  However, if you reverse the useCapture setting on the two event handlers, the child event handler responds before that of the parent.  The reason for this is that the child event handler will now be triggered in the capture phase which is prior to the bubbling phase in which the parent event handler will be triggered.  If you set useCapture to true for both event handlers--regardless of order of definition--the parent event handler will be triggered first because it comes before the child in the capturing phase.Conversely, if you set useCapture to false for both event handlers--again regardless of order of definition--the child event handler will be triggered first because it comes before the parent in the bubbling phase.
