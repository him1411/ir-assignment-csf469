I have the following DataFrame:I need to remove the rows where line_race is equal to 0. What\'s the most efficient way to do this?If I\'m understanding correctly, it should be as simple as:But for any future bypassers you could mention that df = df[df.line_race != 0] doesn\'t do anything when trying to filter for None/missing values.Does work:Doesn\'t do anything:Does work:The best way to do this is with boolean masking:UPDATE: Now that pandas 0.13 is out, another way to do this is df.query(\'line_race != 0\').The given answer is correct nontheless as someone above said you can use df.query(\'line_race != 0\') which depending on your problem is much faster. Highly recommend.
