I\'m working on an HTML project, and I can\'t find out how to open the link I want to open in a new tab without javascript. I already know that <a href="http://www.WEBSITE_NAME.com"></a> opens the link in same tab. Any ideas how to make it open in a new one?Set the \'target\' attribute of the link to _blank:Edit: for other examples, see here: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp(Note: I previously suggested blank instead of _blank because, if used, it\'ll open a new tab and then use the same tab if the link is clicked again. However, this is only because, as GolezTrol pointed out, it refers to the name a of a frame/window, which would be set and used when the link is pressed again to open it in the same tab).Use one of these as per your requirements.Open the linked document in a new window or tab:Open the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is default):Open the linked document in the parent frame:Open the linked document in the full body of the window:Open the linked document in a named frame:See MDNIf you would like to make the command once for your entire site, instead of having to do it after every link. Try this place \n within the Head of your web site and bingo.hope this helpsUse target="_blank":target=\'_blank\' if you are not using XHTML.Use the "target" attribute of the a tag and assign it to _blank. That is:When to use target=\'_blank\' :The HTML version (Some devices not support it):The JavaScript version for all Devices :The use of rel="external" is perfectly validand for Jquery can try with the below one:If browser setting don\'t allow you to open in new windows :You can use\n   <a href=\'url\' target="_blank">name</a>Example\n<a href=\'https://www.facebook.com/hackbalteamz\' target="_blank">Facebook</a>target="_blank" = always new tab for each click \ntarget="tabName" = new tab, but same for each click.You can use <a href="#" target="_blank">Your Text</a>\nHope it helped.\nThanks.Default opens in same tab:Opens in new tab:
