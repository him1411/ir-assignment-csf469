Symbols are usually represented as suchbut if I have a string:is there a built in way in rails/ruby to convert it into a symbol where I can use the :  notation without just doing a raw string regex replace?Rails got ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::String::Inflections module that provides such methods. They\'re all worth looking at. For your example:from: http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html#M000809Returns the Symbol corresponding to str, creating the symbol if it did not previously exist. See Symbol#id2name.This can also be used to create symbols that cannot be represented using the :xxx notation.But for your example ...should go ;)http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html#method-i-parameterizeparameterize is a rails method, and it lets you choose what you want the separator to be. It is a dash "-" by default.intern \xe2\x86\x92 symbol\nReturns the Symbol corresponding to str, creating the symbol if it did not previously existhttp://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/String.html#method-i-internIn Rails you can do this using underscore method:The simpler code is using regex (works with Ruby):Is this what you\'re looking for?::)
