What are the differences between Autotools, Cmake and Scons? In truth, Autotools\' only real \'saving grace\' is that it is what all the GNU projects are largely using.Issues with Autotools:It works...most of the time...is all you can say about Autotools.  It\'s a system that solves several problems that only really concerns the GNU project...for their base, core toolchain code.  (Edit (05/24/2014): It should be noted that this type of concern is a potentially BAD thing to be worrying about- Heartbleed partially stemmed from this thinking and with correct, modern systems, you really don\'t have any business dealing with much of what Autotools corrects for.  GNU probably needs to do a cruft removal of the codebase, in light of what happened with Heartbleed)  You can use it to do your project and it might work nicely for a smallish project that you don\'t expect to work anywhere except Linux or where the GNU toolchain is clearly working correctly on.  The statement that it "integrates nicely with Linux" is quite the bold statement and quite incorrect.  It integrates with the GNU toolsuite reasonably well and solves problems that IT has with it\'s goals.This is not to say that there\'s no problems with the other options discussed in the thread here.SCons is more of a replacement for Make/GMake/etc. and looks pretty nice, all things considered  However...The examples given for CMake in this thread are a bit bogus.  However...In truth, your goals should dictate what you choose here.There is a reason many, many projects are ditching qmake, Autotools, etc. and moving over to CMake.  So far, I can cleanly expect a CMake based project to either drop into a cross-compile situation or onto a VisualStudio setup or only need a small amount of clean up because the project didn\'t account for Windows-only or OSX-only parts to the codebase.  I can\'t really expect that out of an SCons based project- and I fully expect 1/3rd or more Autotools projects to have gotten SOMETHING wrong that precludes it building right on any context except the host building one or a Scratchbox2 one.An important distinction must be made between who uses the tools.  Cmake is a tool that must be used by the user when building the software.  The autotools are used to generate a distribution tarball that can be used to build the software using only the standard tools available on any SuS compliant system.  In other words, if you are installing software from a tarball that was built using the autotools, you are not using the autotools.  On the other hand, if you are installing software that uses Cmake, then you are using Cmake and must have it installed to build the software.The great majority of users do not need to have the autotools installed on their box.  Historically, much confusion has been caused because many developers distribute malformed tarballs that force the user to run autoconf to regenerate the configure script, and this is a packaging error.  More confusion has been caused by the fact that most major linux distributions install multiple versions of the autotools, when they should not be installing any of them by default.  Even more confusion is caused by developers attempting to use a version control system (eg cvs, git, svn) to distribute their software rather than building tarballs.It\'s not about GNU coding standards.The current benefits of autotools \xe2\x80\x94 specifically when used with automake \xe2\x80\x94 is that they integrate very well with building Linux distribution.With cmake for example, it\'s always "was it -DCMAKE_CFLAGS or -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS that I need?" No, it\'s neither, it\'s "-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE". Or -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG. It\'s confusing - in autoconf, it\'s just ./configure CFLAGS="-O0 -ggdb3" and you have it.In integration with build infrastructures, scons has the problem that you cannot use make %{?_smp_mflags}, _smp_mflags in this case being an RPM macro that roughly expands to (admin may set it) system power. People put things like -jNCPUS here through their environment. With scons that\'s not working, so the packages using scons may only get serialed built in distros.What is important to know about the Autotools is that they are not a general build system - they implement the GNU coding standards and nothing else. If you want to make a package that follows all the GNU standards, then Autotools are an excellent tool for the job. If you don\'t, then you should use Scons or CMake. (For example, see this question.) This common misunderstanding is where most of the frustration with Autotools comes from.While from a developers point of view, cmake is currently the most easy to use, from a user perspective autotools have one big advantageautotools generate a single file configure script and all files to generate it are shipped with the distribution. it is easy to understand and fix with help of grep/sed/awk/vi. Compare this to Cmake where a lot of files are found in /usr/share/cmak*/Modules, which can\'t be fixed by the user unless he has admin access.So, if something does not quite work, it can usually easily be "fixed" by using Standard Unix tools (grep/sed/awk/vi etc.) in a sledgehammer way without having to understand the buildsystem.Have you ever digged through your cmake build directory to find out what is wrong? Compared to the simple shellscript which can be read from top to bottom, following the generated Cmake files to find out what is going on is quite difficult. ALso, with CMake, adapting the FindFoo.cmake files requires not only knowledge of the CMake language, but also might require superuser privileges.
