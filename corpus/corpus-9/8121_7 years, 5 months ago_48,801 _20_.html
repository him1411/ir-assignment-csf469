Does Python support short-circuiting in boolean expressions?Yep, both and and or operators short-circuit -- see the docs.Let\'s first define a useful function to determine if something is executed or not. A simple function that accepts an argument, prints a message and returns the input, unchanged. One can observe the Python\'s short-circuiting behavior of and, or operators in the following example:Note: The following values are considered by the interpreter to mean false:Python\'s any() and all() functions also support short-circuiting. As shown in the docs; they evaluate each element of a sequence in-order, until finding a result that allows an early exit in the evaluation. Consider examples below to understand both. The function any() checks if any element is True. It stops executing as soon as a True is encountered and returns True. The function all() checks all elements are True and stops executing as soon as a False is encountered:Additionally, in Python Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily; for example, x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false). Edit:\nOne more interesting point to note :- Logical and, or operators in Python returns an operand\'s value instead of a Boolean (True or False). For example:Operation x and y gives the result if x is false, then x, else yUnlike in other languages e.g. &&, || operators in C that return either 0 or 1.Examples: Similarly or operator return left most value for which bool(value) == True else right most false value (according to short-circuiting behavior), examples:  So, how is this useful? One example use given in Practical Python By Magnus Lie Hetland:\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s say a user is supposed to enter his or her name, but may opt to enter nothing, in which case you want to use the default value \'<unknown>\'. You could use an if statement, but you could also state things very succinctly:In other words, if the return value from raw_input is true (not an empty string), it is assigned to name (nothing changes); otherwise, the default \'<unknown>\' is assigned to name.Yes. Try the following in your python interpreter:andor
