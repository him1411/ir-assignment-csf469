I\'m trying to follow a tutorial and it says:"There are a few ways to load credentials.The keys need to be as follows:...This means that if you properly set your environment variables, you do not need to manage credentials in your application at all."Based on some Googling, it appears that I need to set the variables in process.env?  How and where do I set these credentials?  Example Please.  Environment variables (in this case) are being used to pass credentials to your application. USER_ID and USER_KEY can both be accessed from process.env.USER_ID and process.env.USER_KEY respectively. You don\'t need to edit them, just access their contents.It looks like they are simply giving you the choice between loading your USER_ID and USER_KEY from either process.env or some specificed file on disk. Now, the magic happens when you run the application.USER_ID=239482 USER_KEY=foobar node app.jsThat will pass the user id 239482 and the user key as foobar. This is suitable for testing, however for production, you will probably be configuring some bash scripts to export variables.I highly recommend looking into the dotenv package.https://github.com/motdotla/dotenvIt\'s kind of similar to the library suggested within the answer from @Benxamin, but it\'s a lot cleaner and doesn\'t require any bash scripts. Also worth noting that the code base is popular and well maintained.Basically you need a .env file (which I highly recommend be ignored from your git/mercurial/etc):Then in your application entry file put the following line in as early as possible:Boom. Done.  \'process.env\' will now contain the variables above:The \'.env\' file isn\'t required so you don\'t need to worry about your app falling over in it\'s absence.Just provide the env values on command lineIf you want a management option, try the envs npm package. It returns environment values if they are set. Otherwise, you can specify a default value that is stored in a global defaults object variable if it is not in your environment.Using .env ("dot ee-en-vee") or environment files is good for many reasons. Individuals may manage their own configs. You can deploy different environments (dev, stage, prod) to cloud services with their own environment settings. And you can set sensible defaults. Inside your .env file each line is an entry, like this example:You should not include the .env in your version control repository (add it to your .gitignore file).To get variables from the .env file into your environment, you can use a bash script to do the equivalent of export NODE_ENV=development right before you start your application.Then this goes in your application javascript:You can set the environment variable through process global variable as follows:Works in all platforms.It depends on your operating system and your shellOn linux with the shell bash, you create environment variables like this(in the console):For more information on environment variables on ubuntu (for example):Environment variables on ubuntuFor windows users this Stack Overflow question and top answer is quite useful on how to set environement variables via the command line How can i set NODE_ENV=production in Windows?Came across a nice tool for doing this.node-env-fileParses and loads environment files (containing ENV variable exports) into Node.js environment, i.e. process.env - Uses this style:Important for Windows: There are multiple ways to set Environment-Variables. But most of them are NOT persistant, they are temporary for the current shell.\n(like SET SWEDISH_CHEF="bork bork" or $env:SWEDISH_CHEF = "bork bork")To make it persist use this Poweshell-command :\n[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("SWEDISH_CHEF", "bork bork", "User") \nnote: the 3rd argument, "User", specifies the level (can also be "Process" or "Machine" but from what I\'ve found "User" is actually the one used for process.env)To verify that it persisted: Start a new terminal, run node and enter process.env.SWEDISH_CHEF in the node shell to print the value.edit : the env var doesn\'t seem to persist after restart. so I ended up setting it via the GUI under My Computer to make it persist forever A very good way of doing environment variables I have successfully used is below:A. Have different config files:  dev.js // this has all environment variables for development only\nThe file contains:stage.js // this has all environment variables for development only  qa.js // this has all environment variables for qa testing only\nThe file contains:  NOTE: the values are changing with the environment, mostly, but keys remain same.you can have more  z__prod.js // this has all environment variables for production/live only\nNOTE: This file is never bundled for deploymentPut all these config files in /config/ folderNOTE: The name of prod is different than others, as it would not be used by all.B. Set the OS/ Lambda/ AzureFunction/ GoogleCloudFunction environment variables from config fileNow ideally, these config variables in file, should go as OS environment variables (or, LAMBDA function variables, or, Azure function variables, Google Cloud Functions, etc.)  so, we write automation in Windows OS (or other)Assume we write \'setenv\' bat file, which takes one argument that is environment that we want to setNow run "setenv dev"  a) This takes the input from the passed argument variable (\'dev\' for now)\nb) read the corresponding file (\'config\\dev.js\')\nc) sets the environment variables in Windows OS (or other)  For example,The setenv.bat contents might be:The setenv.js contents might be:That\'s all, your environment is ready for use.When you do \'setenv qa\', all qa environment variables will be ready for use from qa.js, and ready for use by same program (which always asks for process.env.someEnvKey1, but the value it gets is qa one).Hope that helps.I was getting undefined after setting a system env var. When I put APP_VERSION in the User env var, then I can display the value from node via process.env.APP_VERSIONAs expansion of @ctrlplusb answer, \nI would suggest you to also take a look to the env-dot-prop package.It allows you to set/get properties from process.env using a dot-path.Let\'s assume that your process.env contains the following:Then you can manipulate the environment variables like that:This helps you to parse the environment variables and use them as a config object in your app.\nIt also helps you implement a 12-factor configuration.
