How do I programmatically set the InitialViewController for a Storyboard? I want to open my storyboard to a different view depending on some condition which may vary from launch to launch.How to without a dummy initial view controllerEnsure all initial view controllers have a Storyboard ID.In the storyboard, uncheck the "Is initial View Controller" attribute from the first view controller.If you run your app at this point you\'ll read:And you\'ll notice that your window property in the app delegate is now nil.In the app\'s setting, go to your target and the Info tab. There clear the value of Main storyboard file base name. On the General tab, clear the value for Main Interface. This will remove the warning.Create the window and desired initial view controller in the app delegate\'s application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method:For all the Swift lovers out there, here is the answer by @Travis translated into SWIFT:Do what @Travis explained before the Objective C code. Then,The ExampleViewController would be the new initial view controller you would like to show.The steps explained:Enjoy and happy programming!You can programmatically set the key window\'s rootViewController in (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptionsfor example:You can set Navigation rootviewcontroller as a main view controller.\nThis idea can use for auto login as per application requirement.For StoryboardSegue UsersThanksOpen mainstoryboard, select the view that you want start first, then open Utilities--> Attributes. Below the "View Controller" you see the "Is initial View Controller" radio button. Just select it.--- To the revised question:May be you can try this: write a method in ViewDidLoad section of your inital view and when the method runs on application launch, method triggers a segue to another view. Swift 3: Update to @victor-sigler\'s codeYou can set initial view controller using Interface Builder as well as programmatically.Below is approach used for programmatically.Objective-C :Swift :I don\'t think it\'s possible.\nInstead you can have one initial controller which will have segues to different view controllers. On startup, you can decide which segue to perform programmatically.I created a routing class to handle dynamic navigation and keep clean AppDelegate class, I hope it will help other too.And in your AppDelegate call thisAnother solution with using Swift 3 and Swift 4 with avoiding force casting is like thisAnd below is using with UINavigationControllerA few days ago I\'ve encountered to same situation. A very simple trick solved this problem. \nI set hidden my initial view controller before launch2. If initial view controller is the right controller it\'s set to visible in viewDidLoad. Else, a segue is performed to desired view controller. It works perfectly in iOS 6.1 and above. I\'m sure it works on earlier versions of iOS.Thanks modified this as follows in AppDelegate:Found simple solution - no need to remove "initial view controller check" from storyboard and editing project Info tab and use makeKeyAndVisible, just place in In AppDelegate.swift you can add the following code:Of course, you need to implement your logic, based on which criteria you\'ll choose an appropriate view controller. Also, don\'t forget to add an identity.Select the view controller which you want to open first and go to attribute inspector.\nGo to initial scene and check is initial view controller option.Now this will be your initial view controller that will open first when application launch.
