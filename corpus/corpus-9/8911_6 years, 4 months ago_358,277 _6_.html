Possible Duplicate:\n  Java: generating random number in a range I want to generate random number in a specific range. (Ex. Range Between 65 to 80)I try as per below code, but it is not very use full. It also returns the value greater then max. value(greater then 80). How can I generate random number in between range?This gives a random integer between 65 (inclusive) and 80 (exclusive), one of 65,66,...,78,79.Note that nextInt(int max) returns an int between 0 inclusive and max exclusive. Hence the +1.
