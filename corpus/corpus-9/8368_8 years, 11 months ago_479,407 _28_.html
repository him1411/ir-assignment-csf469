Using jQuery, how do you check if there is an option selected in a select menu, and if not, assign one of the options as selected.(The select is generated with a maze of PHP functions in an app I just inherited, so this is a quick fix while I get my head around those :)While I\'m not sure about exactly what you want to accomplish, this bit of code worked for me.No need to use jQuery for this:lencioni\'s answer is what I\'d recommend.  You can change the selector for the option (\'#mySelect option:last\') to select the option with a specific value using "#mySelect option[value=\'yourDefaultValue\']".  More on selectors.If you\'re working extensively with select lists on the client check out this plugin:\nhttp://www.texotela.co.uk/code/jquery/select/.  Take a look the source if you want to see some more examples of working with select lists.This question is old and has a lot of views, so I\'ll just throw some stuff out there that will help some people I\'m sure.To check if a select element has any selected items:or to check if a select has nothing selected:or if you\'re in a loop of some sort and want to check if the current element is selected:to check if an element is not selected while in a loop:These are some of the ways to do this. jQuery has many different ways of accomplishing the same thing, so you usually just choose which one appears to be the most efficient.Here is my function changing the selected option. It works for jQuery 1.3.2Easy! The default should be the first option. Done! That would lead you to unobtrusive JavaScript, because JavaScript isn\'t needed :)Unobtrusive JavaScriptI already came across the texotela plugin mentioned, which let me solve it like this:Look at the selectedIndex of the select element. BTW, that\'s a plain ol\' DOM thing, not JQuery-specific.This was a quick script I found that worked...\n.Result is assigned to a label.I found a good way to check, if option is selected and select a default when it isn\'t.If #some_select has\'t default selected option then .val() is undefinedYou guys are doing way too much for selecting. Just select by value:This is another way of checking an option is selected or not in jquery. This will return Boolean (True or False).[1] is index of select box option Change event on the select box to fire and once it does then just pull the id attribute of the selected option :-I was just looking for something similar and found this:This finds all select menus in the class that don\'t already have an option selected, and selects the default option ("2" in this case).I tried using :selected instead of [selected], but that didn\'t work because something is always selected, even if nothing has the attributeIf you need to explicitly check each option to see if any have the "selected" attribute you can do this. Otherwise using option:selected you\'ll get the value for the first default option.
