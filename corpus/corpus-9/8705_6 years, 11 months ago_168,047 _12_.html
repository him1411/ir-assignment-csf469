I know that %0 contains the full path of the batch script, e.g. c:\\path\\to\\my\\file\\abc.batI would path to be equal to c:\\path\\to\\my\\fileHow could I achieve that ?%~dp0 will be the directory. Here\'s some documentation on all of the path modifiers. Fun stuff :-)To remove the final backslash, you can use the :n,m substring syntax, like so:I don\'t believe there\'s a way to combine the %0 syntax with the :~n,m syntax, unfortunately.%~dp0 may be a relative path.\nTo convert it to a full path, try something like this:You can use following script to get the path without trailing "\\"That would be the %CD% variable.%CD% returns the current directory the batch script is in.I am working on a Windows 7 machine and I have ended up using the lines below to get the absolute folder path for my bash script. I got to this solution after looking at http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-parameter-expansion.
