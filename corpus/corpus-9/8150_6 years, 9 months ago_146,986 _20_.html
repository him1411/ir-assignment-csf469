I usually run a program as :I would like to debug it using gdb.I am aware of the set args functionality, but that only works from the gdb prompt.Pass the arguments to the run command from within gdb.You can do this:The magic bit being --args.Just type run in the gdb command console to start debugging.Start GDB on your project. Go to project directory, where you\'ve already compiled the project executable. Issue the command gdb and the name of the executable as below:gdb projectExecutablenameThis starts up gdb, prints the following:\nGNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.11.1-0ubuntu1~16.04) 7.11.1\nCopyright (C) 2016 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n.................................................\nType "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word"...\nReading symbols from projectExecutablename...done.\n(gdb)Before you start your program running, you want to set up your breakpoints. The break command allows you to do so. To set a breakpoint at the beginning of the function named main:(gdb) b mainOnce you\'ve have the (gdb) prompt, the run command starts the executable running. If the program you are debugging requires any command-line arguments, you specify them to the run command. If you wanted to run my program on the "xfiles" file (which is in a folder "mulder" in the project directory), you\'d do the following:(gdb) r mulder/xfilesHope this helps. Disclaimer: This solution is not mine, it is adapted from https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/guide_gdb.html\nThis short guide to gdb was, most probably, developed at Stanford University.If you want to have bare run command in gdb to execute your program with redirections and arguments, you can use set args:I was unable to achieve the same behaviour with --args parameter, gdb fiercely escapes the redirections, i.e.This one actually redirects the input of gdb itself, not what we really want here
