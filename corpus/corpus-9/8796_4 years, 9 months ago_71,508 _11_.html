I had my solution in Visual Studio 2012 (which is under TFS source control) open and the TFS server (2010) was down. When I then made a change to one of the files and attempted to save it I got a prompt to ask whether I wanted to Overwrite the file saying the TFS server was down (can\'t remember the exact words) and the following message appeared in the Output window:How do I get the file change to be recognised as being among Pending Changes and the whole solution back online?I searched for the solution online and found this solution but wasn\'t too keen on the registry change.I found a better way: right-click on the solution name right at the top of the Solution Explorer and select the Go Online option. Clicking this allowed me to select the files that had been changed when I was offline and make the solution online again.After finding the solution, I found the following msdn forum thread which confirmed the above.Rename the solution\'s corresponding .SUO file. The SUO file contains the TFS status (online/offline), amongst a host of other goodies.Do this only if the "right-click on the solution name right at the top of the Solution Explorer and select the Go Online option" fails (because e.g. you installed VS2015 preview).(Additional step from solution above for if you are missing the AutoReconnect or Offline registry value) For Visual Studio 2015, Version 14Additional info: \nblog MSDN - When and how does my solution go offline?You can go use registry editor.
