I have a SQL table with a datetime field. The field in question can be null. I have a query and I want the results sorted ascendingly by the datetime field, however I want rows where the datetime field is null at the end of the list, not at the beginning.Is there a simple way to accomplish that?(A "bit" late, but this hasn\'t been mentioned at all)You didn\'t specify your DBMS. In standard SQL (and most modern DBMS like Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2, Firebird, Apache Derby, HSQLDB and H2) you can specify NULLS LAST or NULLS FIRST:Use NULLS LAST to sort them to the end:I also just stumbled across this and the following seems to do the trick for me, on MySQL and PostgreSQL:as found at https://stackoverflow.com/a/7055259/496209You can use the built-in function to check for null or not null, as below. I test it and its working fine.select MyDate from MyTable order by ISNULL(MyDate,1) DESC, MyDate ASC;See this blog post.Thanks RedFilter for providing excellent solution to the bugging issue of sorting nullable datetime field.I am using SQL Server database for my project.Changing the datetime null value to \'1\' does solves the problem of sorting for datetime datatype column. However if we have column with other than datetime datatype then it fails to handle. To handle a varchar column sort, I tried using \'ZZZZZZZ\' as I knew the column does not have values beginning with \'Z\'. It worked as expected.On the same lines, I used max values +1  for int and other data types to get the sort as expected. This also gave me the results as were required.However, it would always be ideal to get something easier in the database engine itself that could do something like:As mentioned in the answer provided by a_horse_with_no_name.If your engine allows ORDER BY x IS NULL, x or ORDER BY x NULLS LAST use that. But if it doesn\'t these might help:If you\'re sorting by a numeric type you can do this: (Borrowing the schema from another answer.)Any non-null number becomes 0, and nulls become 1, which sorts nulls last.You can also do this for strings:Because \'a\' > \'\'.This even works with dates by coercing to a nullable int and using the method for ints above: (Lets pretend the schema has HireDate.)These methods avoid the issue of having to come up with or manage a "maximum" value of every type or fix queries if the data type (and the maximum) changes (both issues that other ISNULL solutions suffer). Plus they\'re much shorter than a CASE.Solution using the "case" is universal, but then do not use the indexes.In my case, I needed performance. USE NVL functionHere\'s the alternative of NVL in most famous DBMSIn Oracle, you can use NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST: specifies that NULL values should be returned before / after non-NULL values:For example:Ref: http://docs.oracle.com/javadb/10.8.3.0/ref/rrefsqlj13658.html
