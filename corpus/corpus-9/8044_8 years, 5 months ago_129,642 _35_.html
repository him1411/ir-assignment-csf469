I have a custom view that\'s not getting layoutSubview messages during animation.I have a view that fills the screen. It has a custom subview at the bottom of the screen that correctly resizes in Interface Builder if I change the height of the nav bar. layoutSubviews is called when the view is created, but never again. My subviews are correctly laid out. If I toggle the in-call status bar off, the subview\'s layoutSubviews is not called at all, even though the main view does animate its resize.Under what circumstances is layoutSubviews actually called?I have autoresizesSubviews set to NO for my custom view. And in Interface Builder I have the top and bottom struts and the vertical arrow set.I had a similar question, but wasn\'t satisfied with the answer (or any I could find on the net), so I tried it in practice and here is what I got:My results - http://blog.logichigh.com/2011/03/16/when-does-layoutsubviews-get-called/Building on the previous answer by @BadPirate, I experimented a bit further and came up with some clarifications/corrections. I found that layoutSubviews: will be called on a view if and only if:Some relevant details:Some of the points in BadPirate\'s answer are only partially true:For addSubView point addSubview causes layoutSubviews to be called on the view being added, the view it\xe2\x80\x99s being added to (target view), and all the subviews of the target.It depends on the view\'s (target view) autoresize mask. If it has autoresize mask ON, layoutSubview will be called on each addSubview. If it has no autoresize mask then layoutSubview will be called only when the view\'s (target View) frame size changes.Example: if you created UIView programmatically (it has no autoresize mask by default), LayoutSubview will be called only when UIView frame changes not on every addSubview.It is through this technique that the performance of the application also increases.For the device rotation pointRotating a device only calls layoutSubview on the parent view (the responding viewController\'s primary view)This can be true only when your VC is in the VC hierarchy (root at window.rootViewController), well this is most common case. In iOS 5, if you create a VC, but it is not added into any another VC, then this VC would not get any noticed when device rotate. Therefore its view would not get noticed by calling layoutSubviews.I tracked the solution down to Interface Builder\'s insistence that springs cannot be changed on a view that has the simulated screen elements turned on (status bar, etc.). Since the springs were off for the main view, that view could not change size and hence was scrolled down in its entirety when the in-call bar appeared.Turning the simulated features off, then resizing the view and setting the springs correctly caused the animation to occur and my method to be called.An extra problem in debugging this is that the simulator quits the app when the in-call status is toggled via the menu. Quit app = no debugger.calling \n[self.view setNeedsLayout]; \nin viewController makes it to call viewDidLayoutSubviews have you looked at layoutIfNeeded?The documentation snippet is below. Does the animation work if you call this method explicitly during the animation?layoutIfNeeded\nLays out the subviews if needed.Discussion\nUse this method to force the layout of subviews before drawing.Availability\nAvailable in iPhone OS 2.0 and later.https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/tvos/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewPG_iPhoneOS/CreatingViews/CreatingViews.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009503-CH5-SW1Layout changes can occur whenever any of the following events happens\n  in a view:a. The size of a view\xe2\x80\x99s bounds rectangle changes.\n  b. An interface orientation change occurs, which usually triggers a change in the root view\xe2\x80\x99s bounds rectangle.\n  c. The set of Core Animation sublayers associated with the view\xe2\x80\x99s layer changes and requires layout.\n  d. Your application forces layout to occur by calling the\xc2\xa0setNeedsLayout\xc2\xa0or\xc2\xa0layoutIfNeeded\xc2\xa0method of a view.\n  e. Your application forces layout by calling the\xc2\xa0setNeedsLayout\xc2\xa0method of the view\xe2\x80\x99s underlying layer object.When migrating an OpenGL app from SDK 3 to 4, layoutSubviews was not called anymore. After a lot of trial and error I finally opened MainWindow.xib, selected the Window object, in the inspector chose Window Attributes tab (leftmost) and checked "Visible at launch". It seems that in SDK 3 it still used to cause a layoutSubViews call, but not in 4.6 hours of frustration put to an end.Another part of the puzzle is that the window must be made key:of else the subviews are not automatically resized.Another rather obscure, yet very important case when layoutSubviews never gets called is:
