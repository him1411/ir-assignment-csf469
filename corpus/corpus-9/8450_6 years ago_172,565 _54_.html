How can I convert string to boolean?it returns,boolean truebut it should be boolean false.Strings always evaluate to boolean true unless they have a value that\'s considered "empty" by PHP (taken from the documentation for empty):If you need to set a boolean based on the text value of a string, then you\'ll need to check for the presence or otherwise of that value. EDIT: The above code is intended for clarity of understanding.  In actual use the following code may be more appropriate: This method was posted by @lauthiamkok in the comments.  I\'m posting it here as an answer to call more attention to it.Depending on your needs, you should consider using filter_var() with the FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN flag.The String "false"  is actually considered a "TRUE" value by PHP.\nThe documentation says:To explicitly convert a value to boolean, use the (bool) or (boolean)\n  casts. However, in most cases the cast is unnecessary, since a value\n  will be automatically converted if an operator, function or control\n  structure requires a boolean argument.See also Type Juggling.When converting to boolean, the following values are considered FALSE:the boolean FALSE itselfthe integer 0 (zero)the float 0.0 (zero)the empty string, and the string "0"an array with zero elementsan object with zero member variables (PHP 4 only)the special type NULL (including unset variables)SimpleXML objects created from empty tagsEvery other value is considered TRUE (including any resource).so if you do:orin both cases $bool will be TRUE. So you have to do it manually, like GordonM suggests.When working with Json I had to send a boolean value in the $_POST.I had a similar problem when i did something like As my bool was converted into a sting by json.to overcome this, you can decode the string using json_decode().\n;) (this should normally work with bool values converted to string and sent to the server also by other means i.e. other than using json ) Please mark as an answer if you find this useful, thanks and wish you alot of sun,\nciaoyou can use json_decode to decode that booleanthe easiest thing to do is this:Doing it this way, you can loop through a series of \'true\', \'TRUE\', \'false\' or \'FALSE\' and get the string value to a boolean.orIt handles all possible variants of $stringOther answers are over complicating things. This question is simply logic question. Just get your statement right.Now your answer will be either I have to note that filter_var( $boolString, FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN ); still will be a better option if you need to have strings like on/yes/1 as alias for true.You can use settype method too!SetType($var,"Boolean")\nEcho $var //see 0 or 1I do it in a way that will cast any case insensitive version of the string "false" to the boolean FALSE, but will behave using the normal php casting rules for all other strings. I think this is the best way to prevent unexpected behavior.Or as a function:The answer by @GordonM is good.\nBut it would fail if the $string is already true (ie, the string isn\'t a string but boolean TRUE)...which seems illogical.Extending his answer, I\'d use:From php.netstrval will do this and more.\nSee the docs. http://php.net/manual/en/function.strval.php \nI was getting confused with wordpress shortcode attributes, I decided to write a custom function to handle all possibilities. maybe it\'s useful for someone:A simple way is to check against an array of values that you consider true.You should be able to cast to a boolean using (bool) but I\'m not sure without checking whether this works on the strings "true" and "false".This might be worth a pop thoughIt is worth knowing that the following will evaluate to the boolean False when put inside Everytyhing else will evaluate to true.As descried here:\nhttp://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.boolean.php#language.types.boolean.casting
