Does the .gitignore file belong in the .git folder structure somewhere or in the main source files?Put .gitignore in the working directory.  It doesn\'t work if you put it in the .git (repository) directory.  As the other answers stated, you can place .gitignore within any directory in a Git repository. However, if you need to have a private version of .gitignore, you can add the rules to .git/info/exclude file.You can place .gitignore in any directory in git.It\'s commonly used as a placeholder file in folders, since folders aren\'t usually tracked by git.When in doubt just place it in the root of your repository. See http://help.github.com/git-ignore/ for more information.If you want to do it globally, you can use the default path git will search for. just place it inside a file named "ignore" in the path "~/.config/git"(so full path for your file is: ~/.config/git/ignore)Also, if you create a new account on Github you will have the option to add .gitignore and it will be setup automatically on the right/standard location of your working place. You don\'t have to add anything in there at the begin, just alter the contents any time you want.
