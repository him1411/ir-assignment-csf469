I am developing an app and I know my database *.db will appear in data/data/com.****.***I can access this file from AVD in Eclipse with help of sqlite managerBut I can\'t access this file in my Android phone.\nI google it and it says I need to root my phone to do it, but I don\'t want to do it. (New phone, warranty issues, and security issues) So here is my question: How can I access my data/data/..... directory in my Android phone "without rooting it"? Can I change user permissions for the directory data/data..... without rooting it?Accessing the files directly on your phone is difficult, but you may be able to copy them to your computer where you can do anything you want with it.\nWithout rooting you have 2 options:If the application is debuggable you can use the run-as command in adb shellAlternatively you can use Android\'s backup function.You will now be prompted to \'unlock your device and confirm the backup operation\'. It\'s best NOT to provide a password, otherwise it becomes more difficult to read the data. Just click on \'backup my data\'. The resulting \'backup.ab\' file on your computer contains all application data in android backup format. Basically it\'s a compressed tar file. This page explains how you can use OpenSSL\'s zlib command to uncompress it. \nYou can use the  adb restore backup.db command to restore the backup. You could also try fetching the db using root explorer app. And if that does not work then you can try this:After this you should be able to browse the files on the device.To do any of the above (i.e. access protected folders from within your phone itself), you still need root.  (That includes changing mount-permissions on the /data folder and accessing it)Without root, accessing the /data directly to read except from within your application via code isn\'t possible. So you could try copying that file to sdcard or somewhere accessible, and then, you should be able to access it normally.Rooting won\'t void your warranty if you have a developer device. I\'m sorry, there isn\'t any other way AFAIK.The easiest way (just one simple step) to pull a file from your debuggable application folder (let\'s say /data/data/package.name/databases/file) on an unrooted Android 5.0+ device is by using this command:Use File Explorer in eclipse. Select Windows => Show View => Other ... => File Explorer.An another way is pull the file via adb:On a rooted device, the correct solution is this:The original solution worked, but the chmod would return unknown directory. Changing the chmod command to /data/data/* gave access to all subfolders in the data directory from DDMS in Intellij. I assume the same solution is true for Eclipse DDMS.UPDATE\nSo, what I\'ve found is strange. I\'m running a Nexus 6 using DDMS in IntelliJ (Android Device Monitor). I have built a little starter app. Said app saves data to a .csv file in data/data/com.example.myapp/filesWhen I first started to try to access this file on my Nexus 6, I found that I have to root the device.. I could see the data folder, but trying to open it would not work. As mentioned online in other places, the expand + would vanish then reappear shortly thereafter (note, there are solutions on the web that claim to allow access to these folders without rooting, I didn\'t find them till too late, and I\'m not sure if I prefer not to root anyway ((I\'d rather be able to do it manually than rely on an app or command prompt to give me my solutions))). I rooted my 6 and tried DDMS again. At this point, it showed me the data folder and I could expand the folder and see the com. directories, but I could not open any of them. That is when I discovered the above solution. The initial instructions would not work on this part:That is when I tried the solution I posted:That solution seemed to work, but only on certain folders. I now could expand my myapp folder, but could not expand the files directory in it.At this point, I played around for a while then figured why not just try it on the directory I need rather than trying these wildcard entries.Followed by:These commands allowed me to expand and view the files in my app\'s directory to confirm that the .csv was being saved correctly.Hope this helps someone. I struggled with this for hours!(to compound on this a tad further, oddly enough, the permissions did not pass to the .csv file that passed to the files directory. my files directory permissions read drwxrwxrwx and my log.csv file permissions read -rw-rw---- .. just fyi)I had also the same problem once. There is no way to access directly the file within android devices except adb shell or rooting device.Beside here are 02 alternatives:1)    2) Try this: https://github.com/sanathp/DatabaseManager_For_Android If you are using Android Studio 3.0 or later version then follow these steps.    You can only expand packages which runs in debug mode on non-rooted device.One of the simple way is to create your database on SD-Card. Because you cannot get access to your phone\'s data folder in internal memory, unless you root your phone. So why not simply create your database on SD-Card.Moreover, if you want, you may write some file copying-code to copy your existing database file (from internal memory) to external memory without requiring any root.you can copy this db file to somewhere in eclipse explorer (eg:sdcard or PC),and you can use sqlite to access and update this db file .The question is: how-to-access-data-data-folder-in-android-device?If android-device is Bluestacks \n*\nRoot Browser APK shows data/data/..Try to download Root Browser\nfrom\nhttps://apkpure.com/root-browser/com.jrummy.root.browserfreeIf the file is a text file \nyou need to click on "Open as", "Text file", "Open as", "RB Text Editor"  Open command line cmd and run this:\nadb backup -f C:\\Intel\\xxx.ab -noapk your.app.package.\nDo not enter password and click on Backup my data.\nMake sure not to save on drive C root. You may be denied.\nThis is why I saved on C:\\Intel.may be to access this folder you need administrative rights.so you have two options:- p.s. : if you are using any of above two options you can access this folder by following these       stepsopen DDMS perspective -> your device ->(Select File Explorer from\n  right window options)  select package -> data -> data -> package name\n  ->filesand from there you can pull up your file
