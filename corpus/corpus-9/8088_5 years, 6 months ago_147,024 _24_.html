Possible Duplicate:\n  What is the most “pythonic” way to iterate over a list in chunks? Is it possible to split a python string every nth character?For example, suppose I have a string containing the following:How can I get it to look like this:Just to be complete, you can do this with a regex:As pointed out in the comment, you can do this:You can also do the following, to simplify the regex for longer chunks:And you can use re.finditer if the string is long to generate chunk by chunk. I think this is shorter and more readable than the itertools version:Another common way of grouping elements into n-length groups:This method comes straight from the docs for zip().I like this solution:Here\'s my solution:Using lambda:Use itertools. The "Recipes" section of the manual provides a function to do exactly this:Try the following code:As always, for those who love one linersUsing more-itertools from PyPI:Spooky one – tried to invent yet another answer:OutI\'ve got this code that I use whenever I need to do this:Where:Here is another solution for a more general case where the chunks are not of equal length. If the length is 0, all the remaining part is returned.data is the sequence to be split; fieldsize is a tuple with the list of the field length.
