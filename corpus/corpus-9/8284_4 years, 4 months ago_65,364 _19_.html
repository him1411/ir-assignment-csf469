I\'m currently looking at this start tutorial video for angular.jsAt some moment (after 12\'40"), the speaker states that the attributes ng-app and data-ng-app="" are more or less equivalent inside the <html> tag, and so are ng-model="my_data_binding and data-ng-model="my_data_binding". However The speaker says the html would be validated through different validators, depending on which attribute is used.Could you explain the difference between the two ways, ng- prefix against data-ng- prefix ? Good question. The difference is simple - there is absolutely no difference between the two except that certain HTML5 validators will throw an error on a property like ng-app, but they don\'t throw an error for anything prefixed with data-, like data-ng-app.So to answer your question, use data-ng-app if you would like validating your HTML to be a bit easier.Fun fact: You can also use x-ng-app to the same effect.From Angularjs DocumentationAngular normalizes an element\'s tag and attribute name to determine\n  which elements match which directives. We typically refer to\n  directives by their case-sensitive camelCase normalized name (e.g.\n  ngModel). However, since HTML is case-insensitive, we refer to\n  directives in the DOM by lower-case forms, typically using\n  dash-delimited attributes on DOM elements (e.g. ng-model).The normalization process is as follows:Strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes. Convert the :, -, or _-delimited name to camelCase. Here are some equivalent\n  examples of elements that match ngBind:based on above statement below all are valid directives1. ng-bind \n 2. ng:bind\n 3. ng_bind\n 4. data-ng-bind\n 5. x-ng-bind The differences lies in the fact that custom data-*attributes are valid in the HTML5 specification. So if you need your markup to be validated, you should use them rather than the ng attributes.ng-model and data-ng-model are same and equivalent!\nreason for: data- prefix \nHTML5 specification expects any custom attribute to be prefixed by data-.reason for: both ng-model and data-ng-model are same and equivalent.AngularJS Document - Normalization\n  \n  Angular normalizes an element\'s tag and attribute name to determine which elements match which directives. We typically refer to directives by their case-sensitive camelCase normalized name (e.g. ngModel). However, since HTML is case-insensitive, we refer to directives in the DOM by lower-case forms, typically using dash-delimited attributes on DOM elements (e.g. ng-model).\n  \n  \n  The normalization process is as follows:\n  \n  1. Strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes.\n  \n  2. Convert the :, -, or_-delimited name to camelCase.\n  \n  \n  For example \n  the following forms are all equivalent and match the ngBind directive:You can use data-ng-, instead of ng-, if you want to make your page HTML valid.if you want to manipulate html or html-fragments on your server before serving it to the browser, you most definitely want to be using data-ng-xxx attributes instead of just ng-xxx attributes.
