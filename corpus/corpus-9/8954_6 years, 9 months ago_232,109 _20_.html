How to create a sub-array from another array? Is there a method that takes the indexes from the first array such as:I don\'t want to go over making loops and making my program suffer.I keep getting error:cannot find symbol method copyOfRange(int[],int,int)This is my code:You can use   Javadoc JavadocArrays.copyOfRange(..) was added in Java 1.6. So perhaps you don\'t have the latest version. If it\'s not possible to upgrade, look at System.arraycopy(..)Yes, it\'s called System.arraycopy(Object, int, Object, int, int) .It\'s still going to perform a loop somewhere though, unless this can get optimized into something like REP STOSW by the JIT (in which case the loop is inside the CPU).Use copyOfRange method from java.util.Arrays class:int[] newArray = Arrays.copyOfRange(oldArray, startIndex, endIndex);For more details:Link to similar questionUsing Apache ArrayUtils downloadable at this link you can easy use the method "boolean" is only an example, there are methods for all primitives java typesThe code is correct so I\'m guessing that you are using an older JDK.  The javadoc for that method says it has been there since 1.6.  At the command line type:I\'m guessing that you are not running 1.6I you are using java prior to version 1.6 use System.arraycopy() instead. Or upgrade your environment.
