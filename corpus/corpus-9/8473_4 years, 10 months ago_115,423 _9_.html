Suppose we\'re building an address book application (contrived example) with AngularJS.We have a form for contacts that has inputs for email and phone number, and we want to require one or the other, but not both: We only want the email input to be required if the phone input is empty or invalid, and vice versa.Angular has a required directive, but it\'s not clear from the documentation how to use it in this case. So how can we conditionally require a form field? Write a custom directive?There\'s no need to write a custom directive. Angular\'s documentation is good but not complete. In fact, there is a directive called ngRequired, that takes an Angular expression.Here\'s a more complete example: http://jsfiddle.net/uptnx/1/if you want put a input required if other is written:Regards.Simple you can use angular validation like :You can now fill the value in only one text field. Either you can fill name or lastname. In this way you can use conditional required fill in AngularJs.
