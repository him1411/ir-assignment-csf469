I\'m having some trouble working with dates on my Android application that uses SQLite.\nI have a couple questions:You can use a text field to store dates within SQLite.Storing dates in UTC format, the default if you use datetime(\'now\') (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss) will then allow sorting by the date column.Retrieving dates as strings from SQLite you can then format/convert them as required into local regionalised formats using the Calendar or the android.text.format.DateUtils.formatDateTime method.Here\'s a regionalised formatter method I use;The best way is to store the dates as a number, received by using the Calendar command.Why do this? First of all, getting values from a date range is easy. Just convert your date into milliseconds, and then query appropriately. Sorting by date is similarly easy. The calls to convert among various formats are also likewise easy, as I included. Bottom line is, with this method, you can do anything you need to do, no problems. It will be slightly difficult to read a raw value, but it more than makes up that slight disadvantage with being easily machine readable and usable. And in fact, it is relatively easy to build a reader (And I know there are some out there) that will automatically convert the time tag to date as such for easy of reading.It\'s worth mentioning that the values that come out of this should be long, not int. Integer in sqlite can mean many things, anything from 1-8 bytes, but for almost all dates 64 bits, or a long, is what works.EDIT: As has been pointed out in the comments, you have to use the cursor.getLong() to properly get the timestamp if you do this.For storing, you could use a utility methodlike so:Another utility method takes care of the loadingcan be used like this:Ordering by date is simple SQL ORDER clause (because we have a numeric column). The following will order descending (that is newest date goes first):Always make sure to store the UTC/GMT time, especially when working with java.util.Calendar and java.text.SimpleDateFormat that use the default (i.e. your device\'s) time zone. \njava.util.Date.Date() is safe to use as it creates a UTC value.SQLite can use text, real, or integer data types to store dates.\nEven more, whenever you perform a query, the results are shown using format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.Now, if you insert/update date/time values using SQLite date/time functions, you can actually store milliseconds as well.\nIf that\'s the case, the results are shown using format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%f.\nFor example:Now, doing some queries to verify if we are actually able to compare times:You can check the same SELECT using col2 and col3 and you will get the same results.\nAs you can see, the second row (126 milliseconds) is not returned. Note that BETWEEN is inclusive, therefore...... will return the same set.Try playing around with different date/time ranges and everything will behave as expected.What about without strftime function?What about without strftime function and no milliseconds?What about ORDER BY?Works just fine.Finally, when dealing with actual operations within a program (without using the sqlite executable...)BTW: I\'m using JDBC (not sure about other languages)... the sqlite-jdbc driver v3.7.2 from xerial - maybe newer revisions change the behavior explained below...\nIf you are developing in Android, you don\'t need a jdbc-driver. All SQL operations can be submitted using the SQLiteOpenHelper.JDBC has different methods to get actual date/time values from a database: java.sql.Date, java.sql.Time, and java.sql.Timestamp.The related methods in java.sql.ResultSet are (obviously) getDate(..), getTime(..), and getTimestamp() respectively.For example:Since SQLite doesn\'t have an actual DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP data type all these 3 methods return values as if the objects were initialized with 0:So, the question is: how can we actually select, insert, or update Date/Time/Timestamp objects? There\'s no easy answer.\nYou can try different combinations, but they will force you to embed SQLite functions in all the SQL statements. It\'s far easier to define an utility class to transform text to Date objects inside your Java program. But always remember that SQLite transforms any date value to UTC+0000.In summary, despite the general rule to always use the correct data type, or, even integers denoting Unix time (milliseconds since epoch), I find much easier using the default SQLite format (\'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%f\' or in Java \'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS\') rather to complicate all your SQL statements with SQLite functions. The former approach is much easier to maintain.TODO: I will check the results when using getDate/getTime/getTimestamp inside Android (API15 or better)... maybe the internal driver is different from sqlite-jdbc...Usually (same as I do in mysql/postgres) I stores dates in int(mysql/post) or text(sqlite) to store them in the timestamp format.Then I will convert them into Date objects and perform actions based on user TimeZone1 -Exactly like StErMi said.2 - Please read this: http://www.vogella.de/articles/AndroidSQLite/article.html3 - see here: Query() in SQLiteDatabase4 - see answer 3I prefer this. This is not the best way, but a fast solution."SELECT  "+_ID+" ,  "+_DESCRIPTION +","+_CREATED_DATE +","+_DATE_TIME+" FROM "+TBL_NOTIFICATION+" ORDER BY "+"strftime(%s,"+_DATE_TIME+") DESC";
