What is the correct format to pass to the date() function in PHP if I want to insert the result into a MySQL datetime type column?I\'ve been trying date("Y-M-D G:i:s") but that just inserts "0000-00-00 00:00:00" everytime.The problem is that you\'re using \'M\' and \'D\', which are a textual representations, MySQL is expecting a numeric representation of the format 2010-02-06 19:30:13Try: date("Y-m-d H:i:s") which uses the numeric equivalents.edit: switched G to H, though it may not have impact, you probably want to use 24-hour format with leading 0s.From the comments of php\'s date() manual page:You had the \'Y\' correct - that\'s a full year, but \'M\' is a three character month, while \'m\' is a two digit month. Same issue with \'D\' instead of \'d\'. \'G\' is a 1 or 2 digit hour, where \'H\' always has a leading 0 when needed.Here\'s an alternative solution: if you have the date in PHP as a timestamp, bypass handling it with PHP and let the DB take care of transforming it by using the FROM_UNIXTIME function.I use the following PHP code to create a variable that I insert into a MySQL DATETIME column.This will hold the server\'s current Date and Time.Format time stamp to MySQL DATETIME column :Format MySQL datetime with PHPThere is no need no use the date() method from PHP if you don\'t use a timestamp. If dateposted is a datetime column, you can insert the current date like this:I use this function (PHP 7)Older versions of PHP (PHP < 7)This has been driving me mad looking for a simple answer. Finally I made this function that seems to catch all input and give a good SQL string that is correct or at least valid and checkable. If it\'s 1999-12-31 it\'s probably wrong but won\'t throw a bad error in MySQL.
