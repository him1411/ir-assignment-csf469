I have a project which requires printing an HTML table with many rows.My problem is the way the table is printed over multiple page. It will sometimes cut a row in half, making it unreadable because one half is on the bleeding edge of a page and the remainder is printed on the top of the next page.The only plausible solution I can think of is using stacked DIVs instead of a table and force page-breaks if needed.. but before going through the whole change I thought I could ask here before.Note: when using the page-break-after:always for the  tag it will create a page break after the last bit of the table, creating an entirely blank page at the end every time!\nTo fix this just change it to page-break-after:auto.\nIt will break correctly and not create an extra blank page.Expanding from Sinan \xc3\x9cn\xc3\xbcr solution:It seems that page-break-inside:avoid in some browsers is only taken in consideration for block elements, not for cell, table, row neither inline-block.If you try to display:block the TR tag, and use there page-break-inside:avoid, it works, but messes around with your table layout.None of the answers here worked for me in Chrome. AAverin on GitHub has created some useful Javascript for this purpose and this worked for me: Just add the js to your code and add the class \'splitForPrint\' to your table and it will neatly split the table into multiple pages and add the table header to each page.Use these CSS properties:For instance:viai recently have solve this problem with a good solution.Css:Js:Works like a charm!I ended up following @vicenteherrera\'s approach, with some tweaks (that are possibly bootstrap 3 specific). Basically; we can\'t break trs, or tds because they\'re not block-level elements. So we embed divs into each, and apply our page-break-* rules against the div. Secondly; we add some padding to the top of each of these divs, to compensate for any styling artifacts.The margin and padding adjustments were necessary to offset some kind of jitter that was being introduced (by my guess - from bootstrap). I\'m not sure that I\'m presenting any new solution from the other answers to this question, but I figure maybe this will help someone.I checked many solutions and anyone wasn\'t working good.So I tried a small trick and it works:tfoot with style:position: fixed; bottom: 0px;\nis placed at the bottom of last page, but if footer is too high it is overlapped by content of table.tfoot with only: display: table-footer-group;\nisn\'t overlapped, but is not on the bottom of last page...Let\'s put two tfoot:One reserves place on non-last pages, second puts in your accual footer.Well Guys... Most of the Solutions up here didn\'t worked for. So this is how things worked for me..HTMLThe first set of head is used as a dummy one so that there won\'t be a missing top border in 2nd head(i.e. original head) while page break.I\'ve tried all suggestions given above and found simple and working cross browser solution for this issue.  There is no styles or page break needed for this solution.  For the solution, the format of the table should be like:Above format tested and working in cross browsersThe accepted answer did not work for me in all browsers, but following css did work for me:The html structure was:In my case, there were some additional issues with the thead tr, but this resolved the original issue of keeping the table rows from breaking.Because of the header issues, I ultimately ended up with:This didn\'t prevent rows from breaking; just each cell\'s content.
