I have an Activity named whereActity which has child dialogs as well. Now, I want to display this activity as a dialog for another activity.How can I do that?To start activity as dialog I defined it like this in AndroidManifest.xml:Use this property inside your activity tag to avoid that your Dialog appears in the recently used apps list If you want to stop your dialog / activity from being destroyed when the user clicks outside of the dialog:After setContentView() in your Activity use:this.setFinishOnTouchOutside(false); Now when I call startActivity() it displays as a dialog, with the previous activity shown when the user presses the back button.Note that if you are using ActionBarActivity (or AppCompat theme), you\'ll need to use @style/Theme.AppCompat.Dialog instead.Use this code so that the dialog activity won\'t be closed when the user touches outside the dialog box:requires API level 11You can define this style in values/styles.xml to perform a more former Splash :And use it AndroidManifest.xml:1 - You can use the same activity as both dialog and full screen, dynamically:Call setTheme(android.R.style.Theme_Dialog) before calling setContentView(...) and super.oncreate() in your Activity.2 - If you don\'t plan to change the activity theme style you can use (as mentioned by @faisal khan)If your activity is being rendered as a dialog, simply add a button to your activity\'s xml,Then attach a click listener in your Activity\'s Java code. In the listener, simply call finish()That should dismiss your dialog, returning you to the calling activity.If you need Appcompat Versionstyle.xmlyourmanifest.xmlIf you want to remove activity header & provide a custom view for the dialog add the following to the activity block of you manifestand design your activity_layout with your desired view
