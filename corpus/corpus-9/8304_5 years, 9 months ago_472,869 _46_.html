I have many users on my web site (20000-60000 per day), which is a download site for mobile files.  I have remote access to my server (windows server 2008-R2).   I\'ve received "Server is unavailable" errors before, but am now seeing a connection timeout error.\n  I\'m not familiar with this - why does it occur and how can I fix it? The full error is below:Server Error in \'/\' Application. Timeout expired.  The timeout period\n  elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not\n  responding.

There are over 482,751 records in that table.  Looks like you have a query that is taking longer than it should.\nFrom your stack trace and your code you should be able to determine exactly what query that is.This type of timeout can have three causes; A deadlock can be difficult to fix, but it\'s easy to determine whether that is the case. Connect to your database with Sql Server Management Studio. In the left pane right-click on the server node and select Activity Monitor. Take a look at the running processes.\nNormally most will be idle or running. When the problem occurs you can identify any blocked process by the process state. If you right-click on the process and select details it\'ll show you the last query executed by the process.The second issue will cause the database to use a sub-optimal query plan. It can be resolved by clearing the statistics:If that doesn\'t work you could also tryYou should not do this when your server is under heavy load because it will temporarily incur a big performace hit as all stored procs and queries are recompiled when first executed. \nHowever, since you state the issue occurs sometimes, and the stack trace indicates your application is starting up, I think you\'re running a query that is only run on occasionally. You may be better off by forcing SQL Server not to reuse a previous query plan. See this answer for details on how to do that.I\'ve already touched on the third issue, but you can easily determine whether the query needs tuning by executing the query manually, for example using Sql Server Management Studio. If the query takes too long to complete, even after resetting the statistics you\'ll probably need to tune it. For help with that, you should post the exact query in a new question.In your code where you run the stored procedure you should have something like this:Add such a line of code:This will wait as much time as needed for the operation to complete.You could set the CommandTimeout property of the SQL Command to allow for the long running SQL transaction.You might also need to look at the SQL Query that is causing the timeout.While all the earlier responses address the issue they did not cover all cases.Microsoft has acknowledged the issue and fixed it in 2011 for supported operating systems, so if you get the stack trace like:you may need to update your .NET assemblies.This issue occurs because of an error in the connection-retry\n  algorithm for mirrored databases.When the retry-algorithm is used, the data provider waits for the\n  first read (SniReadSync) call to finish. The call is sent to the\n  back-end computer that is running SQL Server, and the waiting time is\n  calculated by multiplying the connection time-out value by 0.08.\n  However, the data provider incorrectly sets a connection to a doomed\n  state if a response is slow and if the first SniReadSync call is not\n  completed before the waiting time expires.See KB 2605597 for detailshttps://support.microsoft.com/kb/2605597Maybe it will be useful for somebody.\nI faced with the same problem and in my case the reason was the SqlConnection was opened and not disposed in the method that I called in loop with about 2500 iterations. Connection pool was exhausted. Proper disposing solved the problem.I encountered this error recently and after some brief investigation, found the cause to be that we were running out of space on the disk holding the database (less than 1GB).As soon as I moved out the database files (.mdf and .ldf) to another disk on the same server (with lots more space), the same page (running the query) that had timed-out loaded within three seconds.One other thing to investigate, while trying to resolve this error, is the size of the database log files. Your log files just might need to be shrunk.I faced same problem worked on it around 3 days. I noticed as our number of records are not much our senior developer keeps 2 images and Fingerprint in database. When I try to fetch this hex values it taking long time, I calculate average time to execute my procedure its around 38 seconds. The default commandtimeout is 30 seconds so its less than average time required to run my stored procedure. I set my commandtimeout like belowand its working fine but sometimes if your query takes more than 50 seconds it will prompt same error.@SilverLight.. This is clearly an issue with a Database object. It can be a badly written query, or missing indexes. But as of now I won\'t suggest you to increase the timeout without investigating the issue with your Database objectsPut a breakpoint on this line of code to findout the procedure name and then optimise the procedure by looking at its execution plan. I cannot help you more till the time you post details about the stored procedure.trythen \nrebuild your indexYou have to set CommandTimeout attribute. You can set the CommandTimeout attribute in DbContext child class.I have issue with large calculation in sp_foo that take large time so i fixed\nwith this little bit code
