I am trying to compile some sources using a makefile. In the makefile there is a bunch of commands that need to be ran as sudo. When I compile the sources from a terminal all goes fine and the make is paused the first time a sudo command is ran waiting for password. Once I type in the password, make resumes and completes.But I would like to be able to compile the sources in NetBeans. So, I started a project and showed netbeans where to find the sources, but when I compile the project it gives the error:The first time it hits a sudo command.I have looked up the issue on the internet and all the solutions I found point to one thing: disabling the password for this user. Since the user in question here is root. I do not want to do that.Is there any other solution?Granting the user to use that command without prompting for password should resolve the problem. First open a shell console and type:Then edit that file to add to the very end:egwill allow user \'john\' to sudo poweroff, start and stop without being prompted for password.Look at the bottom of the screen for the keystrokes you need to use in visudo - this is not vi by the way - and exit without saving at the first sign of any problem. Health warning: corrupting this file will have serious consequences, edit with care!Try:This will remove the above errors.Try:Use NOPASSWD line for all commands, I mean:Put the line after all other lines in the sudoers file.That worked for me (Ubuntu 14.04).After all alternatives, i found that is the quickest answer, but i don\'t know why.sudo by default will read the password from the attached terminal. Your problem is that there is no terminal attached when it is run from the netbeans console. So you have to use an alternative way to enter the password: that is called the askpass program.The askpass program is not a particular program, but any program that can ask for a password. For example in my system x11-ssh-askpass works fine.In order to do that you have to specify what program to use, either with the environment variable SUDO_ASKPASS or in the sudo.conf file (see man sudo for details).You can force sudo to use the askpass program by using the option -A. By default it will use it only if there is not an attached terminal.Try this one:If by any chance you came here because you can\'t sudo inside the Ubuntu that comes with Windows10Edit the /etc/hosts file from Windows (with Notepad), it\'ll be located at: %localappdata\\lxss\\rootfs\\etc, add 127.0.0.1 WINDOWS8, this will get rid of the first error that it can\'t find the host.To get rid of the no tty present error, always do sudo -S <command>Login into your linux. Fire following commands. Be careful, as editing sudoer is a risky proposition.Once vi editor opens make the following changes:Comment out Defaults    requirettyGo to the end of the file and add Make sure the command you\'re sudoing is part of your PATH.If you have a single (or multi, but not ALL) command sudoers entry, you\'ll get the sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified when the command is not part of your path (and the full path is not specified).You can fix it by either adding the command to your PATH or invoking it with an absolute path, i.e.sudo /usr/sbin/ipsetInstead ofsudo ipsetCommand sudo fails as it is trying to prompt on root password and there is no pseudo-tty allocated (as it\'s part of the script).You need to either log-in as root to run this command or set-up the following rules in your /etc/sudoers\n (or: sudo visudo):Then make sure that your user belongs to admin group (or wheel).Ideally (safer) it would be to limit root privileges only to specific commands which can be specified as %admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/path/to/programIn Jenkins:Eg:-You can use Mask Password Plugin to hide your passwordThis error may also arise when you are trying to run a terminal command (that requires root password) from some non-shell script, eg sudo ls (in backticks) from a Ruby program. In this case, you can use Expect utility (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect) or its alternatives.\n For example, in Ruby to execute sudo ls without getting sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified, you can run this:[this uses one of the alternatives to Expect TCL extension: ruby_expect gem].For the reference, in case someone else encounter the same issue, I was stuck during a good hour with this error which should not happen since I was using the NOPASSWD parameter.What I did NOT know was that sudo may raise the exact same error message when there is no tty and the command the user try to launch is not part of the allowed command in the /etc/sudoers file.Here a simplified example of my file content with my issue:When bguser will try to launch "sudo command_b arg_b" without any tty (bguser being used for some daemon), then he will encounter the error "no tty present and no askpass program specified".Why?Because a comma is missing at the end of line in the /etc/sudoers file...(I even wonder if this is an expected behavior and not a bug in sudo since the correct error message for such case shoud be "Sorry, user bguser is not allowed to execute etc.")I was getting this error because I had limited my user to only a single executable \'systemctl\' and had misconfigured the visudo file.Here\'s what I had: However, you need to include the full path to the executable, even if it is on your path by default, for example:This allows my jenkins user to restart services but not have full root accessFor Ubuntu 16.04 users There is a file you have to read with:  Placing a file with mode 0440 in /etc/sudoers.d/myuser with following content:Should fix the issue.  Do not forget to: No one told what could cause this error, in case of migration from one host to another, remember about checking hostname in sudoers file:So this is my  /etc/sudoers configif it doesn\'t matchit will pop up this error:no tty present and no askpass program specifiedOther options, not based on NOPASSWD:
