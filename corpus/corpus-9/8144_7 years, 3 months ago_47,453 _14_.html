I often want to compare arrays and make sure that they contain the same elements, in any order. Is there a concise way to do this in RSpec?Here are methods that aren\'t acceptable:For example:This fails when the arrays contain duplicate items.For example:This fails when the arrays elements don\'t implement #<=>Try array.should =~ another_arrayThe best documentation on this I can find is the code itself, which is here.Since RSpec 2.11 you can also use match_array.Which could be more readable in some cases.I\'ve found =~ to be unpredictable and it has failed for no apparent reason. Past 2.14, you should probably usenot documented very well but i added links anyways:expect(actual).to eq(expected)expect([1, 2, 3]).to match_array([2, 3, 1])
