I have a functioning Rails 3 app that uses has_many :through associations which is not, as I remake it as a Rails 4 app, letting me save ids from the associated model in the Rails 4 version. These are the three relevant models are the same for the two versions. Categorization.rbQuestion.rbCategory.rbIn both apps, the category ids are getting passed into the create action like thisIn the Rails 3 app, when I create a new question, it inserts into questions table and then into the categorizations table In the rails 4 app, after it processes the parameters in QuestionController#create, I\'m getting this error in the server logsand the question is only getting inserted into the questions tableAlthough I am not storing the category_ids on the Questions model, I set category_ids as a permitted parameter in the questions_controllerCan anyone explain how I\'m supposed to save the category_ids?  Note, there is no create action in the categories_controller.rb of either app.These are the three tables that are the same in both appsUpdateThis is the create action from the Rails 3 appThis is the create action from the Rails 4 appThis is the question_params methodThis https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters seems like the relevant section of the docs:The permitted scalar types are String, Symbol, NilClass, Numeric, TrueClass, FalseClass, Date, Time, DateTime, StringIO, IO,\n  ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile and Rack::Test::UploadedFile.To declare that the value in params must be an array of permitted scalar values map the key to an empty array:In my app, the category_ids are passed to the create action in an arrayTherefore, when declaring strong parameters, I explicitly set category_ids to be an arrayWorks perfectly now!If you want to permit an array of hashes(or an array of objects from the  perspective of JSON)2 points to notice here:It should be likeImportant* It must be placed at the end. First and Second answer make me figure it out.If you have a hash structure like this:Then this is how I got it to work:
