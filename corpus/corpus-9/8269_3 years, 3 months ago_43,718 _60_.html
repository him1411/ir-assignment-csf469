How do I randomize or shuffle the elements within an array in Swift? For example, if my array consists of 52 playing cards, I want to shuffle the array in order to shuffle the deck.This answer details how to add a Fisher-Yates (fast an uniform) shuffle in the various versions of Swift. The Swift 3 & 4 versions are the most permissive, but they all at least work for arrays. The naming and behavior for each Swift version matches the mutating and nonmutating sorting methods for that version.These extensions add a shuffle() method to any mutable collection (arrays and unsafe mutable buffers) and a shuffled() method to any sequence:These extensions add a shuffle() method to any mutable collection and a shuffled() method to any sequence:This is the simplest version: add this function anywhere at the top level and you\'ll be able to shuffle arrays and slices:This extension will let you shuffle a mutable Array instance in place:This extension will let you retrieve a shuffled copy of an Array instance:There are some good answers here already, as well as some good illustrations of why writing your own shuffle can be error-prone if you\'re not careful. In iOS 9, macOS 10.11, and tvOS 9 (or later), you don\'t have to write your own. There\'s an efficient, correct implementation of Fisher-Yates in GameplayKit (which, despite the name, is not just for games).If you just want a unique shuffle:If you want to be able to replicate a shuffle or series of shuffles, choose and seed a specific random source; e.g.In iOS 10 / macOS 10.12 / tvOS 10, there\'s also a convenience syntax for shuffling via an extension on NSArray. Of course, that\'s a little cumbersome when you\'re using a Swift Array (and it loses its element type on coming back to Swift):But it\'s pretty easy to make a type-preserving Swift wrapper for it:Here\'s something possibly a little shorter:In Swift 2.0, GameplayKit may come to the rescue! (supported by iOS9 or later)Taking Nate\'s algorithm I wanted to see how this would look with Swift 2 and protocol extensions.This is what I came up with.Now, any MutableCollectionType can use these methods given it uses Int as an IndexThis is what I use:In my case, I had some problems of swapping objects in Array.  Then I scratched my head and go for reinventing the wheel.Swift 3 solution, following @Nate Cook answer: (work if the index starts with 0, see comments below)This is how its done in a Simplest way.import Gamplaykit to your VC and use the below code. Tested in Xcode 8.If you want to get a shuffled String from an Array you can use below code..With Swift 3, if you want to shuffle an array in place or get a new shuffled array from an array, AnyIterator can help you. The idea is to create an array of indices from your array, to shuffle those indices with an AnyIterator instance and swap(_:_:) function and to map each element of this AnyIterator instance with the array\'s corresponding element.The following Playground code shows how it works:You can refactor the previous code and create a shuffled() function inside an Array extension in order to get a new shuffled array from an array:Usage: As an alternative to the previous code, you can create a shuffle() function inside an Array extension in order to shuffle an array in place:Usage: This is a version of Nate\'s implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle for Swift 4\n(Xcode 9, currently in beta).The changes are:This is how to shuffle one array with a seed in Swift 3.0.This is what I use:Simple Example:Form the article of Fisher\xe2\x80\x93Yates shuffle on Wikipediaa). Pencil-and-paper method :b). Modern method:(Durstenfeld\'s version)a). Pencil-and-paper method :b). Modern method:(Durstenfeld\'s version)Reference :Note: \n You can use empty array also.Output:[6, 2, 10, 5, 1, 8, 9, 4, 3, 7][7, 1, 9, 8, 2, 10, 5, 6, 4, 3][8, 9, 6, 10, 5, 2, 7, 4, 3, 1][10, 1, 7, 4, 8, 9, 3, 5, 2, 6][8, 1, 6, 9, 3, 7, 4, 5, 10, 2][4, 3, 7, 9, 1, 5, 8, 6, 10, 2][7, 3, 4, 9, 10, 1, 6, 5, 2, 8][3, 6, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 7, 1, 10][5, 1, 2, 10, 6, 9, 7, 3, 8, 4][7, 9, 3, 8, 2, 1, 5, 4, 6, 10]Please let me know if any queries, Other Swift version will be check soon.You can use generic swap function as well and implement mentioned Fisher-Yates:or less verbose:Here\'s some code that runs in playground. You won\'t need to import Darwin in an actual Xcode project.It stop at "swap(&self[i], &self[j])" when I upgrade the xCode version to 7.4 beta.\nfatal error: swapping a location with itself is not supportedI found the reason that i = j (function of swap will exploded)So I add a condition as belowYA! It\'s OK for me.
