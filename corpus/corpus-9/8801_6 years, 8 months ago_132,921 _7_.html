I\'m trying to pull code from my GitHub repo onto my server, but the pull keeps failing because of merge conflicts. I don\'t want to keep any of the changes that may have occurred on my local server since the last pull.So is there a way I can force Git to overwrite with whatever version is in GitHub, rather than bother me about conflicts?If you truly want to discard the commits you\'ve made locally, i.e. never have them in the history again, you\'re not asking how to pull - pull means merge, and you don\'t need to merge. All you need do is this:I\'d personally recommend creating a backup branch at your current HEAD first, so that if you realize this was a bad idea, you haven\'t lost track of it.If on the other hand, you want to keep those commits and make it look as though you merged with origin, and cause the merge to keep the versions from origin only, you can use the ours merge strategy:You can either use the answer from the duplicate link pointed by nvm.Or you can resolve conflicts by using their changes (but some of your changes might be kept if they don\'t conflict with remote version):
