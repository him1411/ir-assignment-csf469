If I have two lists of type string (or any other type), what is a quick way of joining the two lists?The order should stay the same. Duplicates should be removed (though every item in both links are unique). I didn\'t find much on this when googling and didn\'t want to implement any .NET interfaces for speed of delivery.You could try:MSDN page for AddRangeThis preserves the order of the lists, but it doesn\'t remove any duplicates which Union would do.This does change list a. If you wanted to preserve the original lists then you should use Concat (as pointed out in the other answers):This returns an IEnumerable as long as a is not null.The way with the least space overhead is to use the Concat extension method. It creates an instance of IEnumerable<T> which will enumerate the elements of list1 and list2 in that order.  The Union method might address your needs.  You didn\'t specify whether order or duplicates was important.Take two IEnumerables and perform a union as seen here:Something like this:Or, you can use the \'Union\' extension method that is defined in System.Linq.\nWith \'Union\', you can also specify a comparer, which can be used to specify whether an item should be unioned or not.Like this:It\'s working fine I think so. As previously said, Concat returns a new sequence and while converting the result to List, it does the job perfectly. Implicit conversions may fail sometimes when using the AddRange method.If some item(s) exist in both lists you may use  As long as they are of the same type, it\'s very simple with AddRange:The AddRange method one way: List.AddRange() depending on the types?See this link //Get the products from the both arrays\n//excluding duplicates.I just wanted to test how Union works with the default comparer on overlapping collections of reference type objects. My object is:My test code is:The output is:So, everything works fine.
