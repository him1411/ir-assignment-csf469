By default Android Studio automatically adds a header comment to all new classes, e.g.Where is the setting to customize or remove it?From the menu bar:Then look for Editor -> File and Code Templates in the left hand pane.You have two ways you can change this...1) Select the Includes tab and edit the Created by... text directly.2) Select the Templates tab and edit the #parse("File Header.java") line for any template that you desire.Personally I followed option 1) and made the default header comment a TODO, e.g.These instructions are based on Android Studio v0.3.7. and also tested on v1.2.1.1You can overwrite the ${USER} variable in the template file with the #set( $VARIABLE = "value") function.On windows: Press Ctrl+Alt+S and go to Settings -> File and Code Templates -> Includes -> File Header prepend the #set() function call, for example:As well as Dan\'s answer (which is the much more rigorous way), you can also click into the header, and option-enter (on Mac), and you can choose to edit the default file template. Alternatively, click the little lightbulb to get here as wellStep 1: First hover over the File Header and get the yellow lightbulb and the menu out of it by clicking on it as shown in the following screenshot:Step 2: Then click on the Edit template menu item and get the following pop-up window:Note: In its Description area there are many other available Template variables, you can use them too.Step 3: In the editor area add your name as shown in the following screenshot and click "OK" button and the current file and the future new class file headers will be generated accordingly.Hope this answer will be helpful to somebody else out there! :-) Cheers!\n(This works on Android Studio 2.2 (September, 2015) version.)You can just disable the warning as well. For me the default template was ok but seeing yellow highlighted class javadoc was annoying me. So to disable it go to Settings -> Editor -> Inspections -> General -> Uncheck "Default File Template Usage". You can also do it accross all projects. Just change the Project profile to Default in the same Inspections tab. Settings->Editor->Copyright->Copyright Profilesis another place (apart from "Settings->Editor->File and Code Templates") where similar template could be defined and also triggered whenever file is created.
