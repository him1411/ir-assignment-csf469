When I am running I am getting the following exception repeatedly each time I try to run the program.Error occurred during initialization of VMCould not reserve enough space for object heapCould not create the Java virtual machine.I tried to increase my virtual memory (page size) and RAM size, but to no avail. Can anyone tell me how can I eliminate this error?Run the JVM with -XX:MaxHeapSize=512m (or any big number) (or -Xmx512m for short)This can also be caused by setting something too large on a 32-bit HotSpot vm, for example:where this might/would work:I ran into this when using javac, and it doesn\'t seem to pick up on the command line options,so the solution here it so set _JAVA_OPTIONSAnd this compiles fine.This happens to me on machines with a lot of ram, but with lower memory ulimits. Java decides to allocate a big heap because it detects the ram in the machine, but it\'s not allowed to allocate it because of ulimits. here is how to fix it:    Variables->New: Variable name: _JAVA_OPTIONSVariable value: -Xmx512MVariable name: Path\nVariable value: %PATH%;C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre6\\bin;F:\\JDK\\bin;Change this to your appropriate path.Combined with -Xmx512M use -d64 to make sure you\'re running 64-bit VM. On a 64-bit machine I thought for sure I was running 64-bit virtual machine, but no. After installing 64-bit Java the -d64 option works and -Xmx allows much larger memory sizes.I Got the same error,and resolved this by configuring in the run.conf.batRun the JVM with the configuring run.conf.bat in Jboss5xIf free memory is not available AS you are passing in the statement then please make changes in run.conf.bat32-bit Java requires contiguous free space in memory to run. If you specify a large heap size, there may not be so much contiguous free space in memory even if you have much more free space available than necessary.Installing a 64-bit version of Java helps in these cases, the contiguous memory requirement only applies to 32-bit Java.Sometimes, this error indicates that physical memory and swap on the server actually are fully utilized!I was seeing this problem recently on a server running RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.7 with 48 GB of RAM.  I found that even just runningcaused the same error, which established that the problem was not specific to my application.Running reported that MemFree and SwapFree were both well under 1% of the MemTotal and SwapTotal values, respectively:Stopping a few other running applications on the machine brought the free memory figures up somewhat:At this point, a new instance of Java would start up okay, and I was able to run my application.(Obviously, for me, this was just a temporary solution; I still have an outstanding task to do a more thorough examination of the processes running on that machine to see if there\'s something that can be done to reduce the nominal memory utilization levels, without having to resort to stopping applications.)For the error, "error occurred during initialization of vm could not reserve enough space for object heap jboss" Improper/insufficient memory allocation to our JVM as mentioned below.e.g. JAVA_OPTS="-Xms1303m -Xmx1303m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"  in jboss-eap-6.2\\bin\\standalone.conf or  "JAVA_OPTS=-Xms1G -Xmx1G -XX:MaxPermSize=256M" in jboss-eap-6.2\\bin\\standalone.conf.bat which is nothing but JVM memory allocation pool parameters.Usually its not recommanded to have same size for min and max.If you are running your application from eclipse,Suppose your class is called Test in package mypackage. Run your code like this:This will reserve 1024 MB of heap space for your code. If you want 512 MB, you can use:Use little m in 1024m, 512m, etcI know there\'s a lot of answers here already, but none of them helped me. In the end I opened the file /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options and changed:to That solved it for me. Hopefully this helps someone else here.I had similar issue . I had installed 32 bit version of Java on a 64 bit machine. Upon uninstalling that version and installing 64 bit version of Java. I was able to resolve the issue.Assuming you have enough free memory and you setup you JVM arguments correctly, you might have a problem of memory fragmentation. Check Java maximum memory on Windows XP.I recently faced this issue.  I have 3 java applications that start with 1024m or 1280m heap size.\nJava is looking at the available space in swap, and if there is not enough memory available, the jvm exits.To resolve the issue, I had to end several programs that had a large amount of virtual memory allocated.I was running on x86-64 linux with a 64-bit jvm.I had right amount of memory settings but for me it was using a 64bit intellij with 32 bit jvm. Once I switched to 64 bit VM, the error was gone.Anyway, here is how to fix it:\nGo to Start->Control Panel->System->Advanced(tab)->Environment Variables->System Variables->New:\nVariable name: _JAVA_OPTIONS\nVariable value: -Xmx512MOR Change the ant call as shown as below.It worked for me.Error occurred during initialization of VM\n           Could not reserve enough space for 1572864KB object heapI changed value of memory in settings.grade file\n1536 to 512 and it helpedI got this error while running tests during \'mvn install\'. Solved it by adding following in the pom.xml:-Xms256m -Xmx512mIn case you are running a java program:\n- run your program in a terminal using the correct command for linux it would be \'java -jar myprogram.jar\' and add -Xms256m -Xmx512m, for instance: \'java -jar myprogram.jar Xms256m -Xmx512m\'In case you are running a .sh script (linux, mac?) or a .bat script (windows) open the script and look for the java options if they are present and increase the memory.If all of the above doesn\'t work, check your processes (ctrl+alt+delete on windows) (ps aux on linux/mac) and kill the processes which use allot of memory and are not necessary for your operating system! => Try to re-run your program.If you\'re running 32bit JVM, change heap size to smaller would probabaly help. You can do this by passing args to java directly or through enviroment variables like following,For 64bit JVM, bigger heap size like -Xms512M -Xmx1536M should work.Run java -version or java -d32, java--d64 for Java7 to check which version you\'re running.In CASSANDRA_HOME/bin/cassandra.bat you would find following configuration You can reduce 2G to some smaller number for e.g. 1G or even lesser and it should work.Same if you are running on unix box, change in .sh file appropriately.Sometimes it relates to If you set it to:It should work.Replace -Xmx2G^ with -Xms512M^ or any greater memory size in cassandra.bat file in cassandra bin directory.No need to do anything just chnage in POM file like below
