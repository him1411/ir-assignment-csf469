My enum consists of the following values:I want to be able to output these values in a user friendly way though.\nI don\'t need to be able to go from string to value again.  I use the Description attribute from the System.ComponentModel namespace. Simply decorate the enum:Then use this code to retrieve it:I do this with extension methods:Maybe I\'m missing something, but what\'s wrong with Enum.GetName?edit: for user-friendly strings, you need to go through a .resource to get internationalisation/localisation done, and it would arguably be better to use a fixed key based on the enum key than a decorator attribute on the same.The easiest solution here is to use a custom extension method (in .NET 3.5 at least - you can just convert it into a static helper method for earlier framework versions).I am assuming here that you want to return something other than the actual name of the enum value (which you can get by simply calling ToString).That other post is Java. You can\'t put methods in Enums in C#.just do something like this:If you want to use different display values for your enum values, you could use Attributes and Reflection.I created a reverse extension method to convert the description back into an enum value:With respect to Ray Booysen, there is a bug in the code: Enum ToString with user friendly stringsYou need to account for multiple attributes on the enum values.Some other more primitive options that avoid classes/reference types:Array methodUsageNested struct methodUsageThe simplest way is just to include this extension class into your project, it will work with any enum in the project:Usage:...Clean summary of the above suggestions with sample:USAGE:I happen to be a VB.NET fan, so here\'s my version, combining the DescriptionAttribute method with an extension method. First, the results:Basic stuff: an enum called EnumType with three values V1, V2 and V3. The "magic" happens in the Console.WriteLine call in Sub Main(), where the last argument is simply v.Description. This returns "One" for V1, "V2" for V2, and "Three" for V3. This Description-method is in fact an extension method, defined in another module called EnumExtensions:Because looking up description attributes using Reflection is slow, the lookups are also cached in a private Dictionary, that is populated on demand.(Sorry for the VB.NET solution - it should be relatively straighforward to translate it to C#, and my C# is rusty on new subjects like extensions)Even cleaner summary:Same usage as underscore describes.You can use Humanizer package with Humanize Enums possiblity. An eaxample:then you can use Humanize extension method on enum directly:This is an update to Ray Booysen\'s code that uses the generic GetCustomAttributes method and LINQ to make things a bit tidier.For flags enum including.I think the best (and easiest) way to solve your problem is to write an Extension-Method for your enum:If you want something completely customizable, try out my solution here:http://www.kevinwilliampang.com/post/Mapping-Enums-To-Strings-and-Strings-to-Enums-in-NET.aspxBasically, the post outlines how to attach Description attributes to each of your enums and provides a generic way to map from enum to description.
