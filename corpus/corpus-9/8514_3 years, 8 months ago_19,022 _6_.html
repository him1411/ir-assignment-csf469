I\'m using a library from a Github project. Is there some way to set up a notification for new project releases?For example, I want to know when a new release appears hereI know I can be notified on every issue update, but that\'s not what I\'m looking for. Though I see some projects are using that as a way to keep people notifiedDon\'t know about email, but you can subscribe to RSS Atom feed with releases:\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/releases.atom\nor tags:\nhttps://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/tags.atomEDIT:To get notification via email you can use Sibbell.com or RSS-to-email service like Blogtrottr.
