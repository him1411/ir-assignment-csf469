I am running an application through gdb and I want to set a breakpoint for any time a specific variable is accessed / changed. Is there a good method for doing this? I would also be interested in other ways to monitor a variable in C/C++ to see if/when it changes.watch only breaks on write, rwatch let you break on read, and awatch let you break on read/write.You can set read watchpoints on memory locations:but one limitation applies to the rwatch and awatch commands; you can\'t use gdb variables\nin expressions:So you have to expand them yourself: Edit: Oh, and by the way. You need either hardware or software support. Software is obviously much slower. To find out if your OS supports hardware watchpoints you can see the can-use-hw-watchpoints environment setting. Assuming the first answer is referring to the C-like syntax (char *)(0x135700 +0xec1a04f) then the answer to do rwatch *0x135700+0xec1a04f is incorrect. The correct syntax is rwatch *(0x135700+0xec1a04f).The lack of ()s there caused me a great deal of pain trying to use watchpoints myself.What you\'re looking for is called a watchpoint.Usage (gdb) watch foo: watch the value of variable foo(gdb) watch *(int*)0x12345678: watch the value pointed by an address, casted to whatever type you want(gdb) watch a*b + c/d: watch an arbitrarily complex expression, valid in the program\'s native languageWatchpoints are of three kinds:You may choose the more appropriate for your needs.For more information, check this out.I just tried the following:So it seems possible, but you do appear to need some hardware support.Yes you can.  http://www.technochakra.com/debugging-types-of-data-breakpoints-in-gdb/ discusses various data breakpoints for gdb.Use watch to see when a variable is written to, rwatch when it is read and awatch when it is read/written from/to, as noted above. However, please note that to use this command, you must break the program, and the variable must be in scope when you\'ve broken the program:Use the watch command. The argument to the watch command is an\n  expression that is evaluated. This implies that the variabel you want\n  to set a watchpoint on must be in the current scope. So, to set a\n  watchpoint on a non-global variable, you must have set a breakpoint\n  that will stop your program when the variable is in scope. You set the\n  watchpoint after the program breaks.
