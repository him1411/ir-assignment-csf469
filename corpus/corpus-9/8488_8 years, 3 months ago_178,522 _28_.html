Assuming a URL of:PHP can read the request variables val1 using the GET array.Is the hash value part2 also readable? Or is this only upto the browser and JavaScript?The main problem is that the browser won\'t even send a request with a fragment part. The fragment part is resolved right there in the browser. So it\'s reachable through JavaScript.Anyway, you could parse a URL into bits, including the fragment part, using parse_url(), but it\'s obviously not your case.Simple test, accessing http://localhost:8000/hello?foo=bar#this-is-not-sent-to-serverThe server receives the request without the #appendage - anything after the hash tag is simply an anchor lookup on the client.You can find the anchor name used within the URL via javascript using, as an example:The parse_url() function in PHP can work if you already have the needed URL string including the fragment (http://codepad.org/BDqjtXix):But I don\'t think PHP receives the fragment information because it\'s client-only.It is retrievable from Javascript - as window.location.hash. From there you could send it to the server with Ajax for example, or encode it and put it into URLs which can then be passed through to the server-side.The hash is never sent to the server, so no.Yes it\'s true, the server doesn\'t get the anchor part. However there is a workaround using cookies. You can find it here: http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2009/04/15/read-the-anchor-part-of-the-url-with-php/The answer is no.The main purpose of the hash is to scroll to a certain part of the page where you have defined a bookmark. e.g. Scroll to this Part when page loads.The browse will scroll such that this line is the first visible content in the page, depending on how much content follows below the line.Yes javascript can acces it, and then a simple ajax call will do the magicI think the hash-value is only used client-side, so you can\'t get it with php.you could redirect it with javascript to php though.This is should workTh part of an URI after the # is called "fragment" and is by definition only available/processed on client side (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier).On the client side, this can be accessed using javaScript with window.location.hash.Yes you can:Use this method to prevent errors:And of course in PHP, explode that puppy and get one of the valuesAnother solution is to add a hidden input field to the php page:Using javascript/jQuery you can set the value of this field on the page load or responding to an event : In php on the server side you can read this value using the $_POST collection:
