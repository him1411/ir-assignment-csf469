I\'m looking for a way to completely remove the separator line in a UITableView when in the plain mode. This is done automatically in grouped, but this also changes the dimensions of the table in a way that is hard to measure. I have set the seperator line color to colorClear. But this does not completely solve the problem.As I am trying to draw a custom background view in the cells, and I want the cells to be seamless, the one pixel line that remains in-between is causing me problems. Is there a more elegant workaround then using a grouped view and then stretching it?Thank you in advanceYou can do this with the UITableView property separatorStyle. Make sure the property is set to UITableViewCellSeparatorStyleNone and you\'re set.Objective-CIn Swift (prior to 3)In Swift 3You can do this in the storyboard / xib editor as well.  Just set Seperator to none.I still had a dark grey line after attempting the other answers.  I had to add the following two lines to make everything "invisible" in terms of row lines between cells.  In Swift: There is bug a iOS 9 beta 4: the separator line appears between UITableViewCells even if you set separatorStyle to UITableViewCellSeparatorStyleNone from the storyboard. To get around this, you have to set it from code, because as of now there is a bug from storyboard. Hope they will fix it in future beta. Here\'s the code to set it:In interface Builder set table view separator "None" \nand those separator lines which are shown after the last cell can be remove by following approach.\nBest approach is to assign Empty View to tableView FooterView in viewDidLoadself.tableView.tableFooterView = UIView()In the ViewDidLoad Method, you have to write this line.This is working Code. In your viewDidLoad:
