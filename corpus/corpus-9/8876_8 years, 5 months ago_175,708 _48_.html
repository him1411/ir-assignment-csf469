Can someone please help me? In Perl, what is the difference between:andandAre there other ways to run shell commands too?executes a command and never returns.\n  It\'s like a return statement in a function.If the command is not found exec returns false.\n  It never returns true, because if the command is found it never returns at all.\n  There is also no point in returning STDOUT, STDERR or exit status of the command.\n  You can find documentation about it in  perlfunc, \n  because it is a function.executes a command and your Perl script is continued after the command has finished.The return value is the exit status of the command.\n  You can find documentation about it in  perlfunc.like system executes a command and your perl script is continued after the command has finished.In contrary to system the return value is STDOUT of the command.\n  qx// is equivalent to backticks.\n  You can find documentation about it in perlop, because unlike system and execit is an operator.What is missing from the above is a way to execute a command asynchronously.\nThat means your perl script and your command run simultaneously.\nThis can be accomplished with open.\nIt allows you to read STDOUT/STDERR and write to STDIN of your command.\nIt is platform dependent though.There are also several modules which can ease this tasks.\nThere is IPC::Open2 and IPC::Open3 and IPC::Run, as well as\nWin32::Process::Create if you are on windows.In general I use system, open, IPC::Open2, or IPC::Open3 depending on what I want to do.  The qx// operator, while simple, is too constraining in its functionality to be very useful outside of quick hacks.  I find open to much handier.Use system when you want to run a command, don\'t care about its output, and don\'t want the Perl script to do anything until the command finishes.orUse qx// when you want to run a command, capture what it writes to STDOUT, and don\'t want the Perl script to do anything until the command finishes.Use exec along with fork when you want to run a command, don\'t care about its output, and don\'t want to wait for it to return.  system is really just You may also want to read the waitpid and perlipc manuals.Use open when you want to write data to a process\'s STDIN or read data from a process\'s STDOUT (but not both at the same time).Use IPC::Open2 when you need to read from and write to a process\'s STDIN and STDOUT.use IPC::Open3 when you need to capture all three standard file handles of the process. I would write an example, but it works mostly the same way IPC::Open2 does, but with a slightly different order to the arguments and a third file handle.perldoc exec():The exec function executes a system command and never returns-- use system instead of exec if you want it to returnperldoc system():Does exactly the same thing as exec LIST , except that a fork is done first, and the parent process waits for the child process to complete.In contrast to exec and system, backticks don\'t give you the return value but the collected STDOUT.perldoc `String`:A string which is (possibly) interpolated and then executed as a system command with /bin/sh or its equivalent. Shell wildcards, pipes, and redirections will be honored. The collected standard output of the command is returned; standard error is unaffected.In more complex scenarios, where you want to fetch STDOUT, STDERR or the return code, you can use well known standard modules like IPC::Open2 and IPC::Open3.Example:Finally, IPC::Run from the CPAN is also worth looking at\xe2\x80\xa6What\'s the difference between Perl\'s backticks (`), system, and exec?exec executes a command and never resumes the Perl script. It\'s to a script like a return statement is to a function.If the command is not found, exec returns false. It never returns true, because if the command is found, it never returns at all. There is also no point in returning STDOUT, STDERR or exit status of the command. You can find documentation about it in perlfunc, because it is a function.E.g.: In above code, there are three print statements, but due to exec leaving the script, only the first print statement is executed. Also, the exec command output is not being assigned to any variable.Here, only you\'re only getting the output of the first print statement and of executing the ls command on standard out.system executes a command and your Perl script is resumed after the command has finished. The return value is the exit status of the command. You can find documentation about it in perlfunc.E.g.: In above code, there are three print statements. As the script is resumed after the system command, all three print statements are executed.Also, the result of running system is assigned to data2, but the assigned value is 0 (the exit code from ls).Here, you\'re getting the output of the first print statement, then that of the ls command, followed by the outputs of the final two print statements on standard out.Like system, enclosing a command in backticks executes that command and your Perl script is resumed after the command has finished. In contrast to system, the return value is STDOUT of the command. qx// is equivalent to backticks. You can find documentation about it in perlop, because unlike system and exec, it is an operator.E.g.: In above code, there are three print statements and all three are being executed. The output of ls is not going to standard out directly, but assigned to the variable data2 and then printed by the final print statement.The difference between \'exec\' and \'system\' is that exec replaces your current program with \'command\' and NEVER returns to your program. system, on the other hand, forks and runs \'command\' and returns you the exit status of \'command\' when it is done running. The back tick runs \'command\' and then returns a string representing its standard out (whatever it would have printed to the screen)You can also use popen to run shell commands and I think that there is a shell module - \'use shell\' that gives you transparent access to typical shell commands.Hope that clarifies it for you.
