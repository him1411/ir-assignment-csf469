I have a codebase where developers decided to use AND and OR instead of && and ||.I know that there is a difference in operators\' precedence (&& goes before and), but with the given framework (PrestaShop to be precise) it is clearly not a reason.Which version are you using? Is and more readable than &&? Or is there no difference?If you use AND and OR, you\'ll eventually get tripped up by something like this:Want to guess what $truthiness equals?If you said false... bzzzt, sorry, wrong!$truthiness above has the value true.  Why?  = has a higher precedence than and. The addition of parentheses to show the implicit order makes this clearer:If you used && instead of and in the first code example, it would work as expected and be false.As discussed in the comments below, this also works to get the correct value, as parentheses have higher precedence than =:Depending on how it\'s being used, it might be necessary and even handy.\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.logical.phpBut in most cases it seems like more of a developer taste thing, like every occurrence of this that I\'ve seen in CodeIgniter framework like @Sarfraz has mentioned.Precedence differs between && and and (&& has higher precedence than and), something that causes confusion when combined with a ternary operator. For instance,will return a string whereaswill return a boolean.For safety, I always parenthesise my comparisons and space them out. That way, I don\'t have to rely on operator precedence:Since and has lower precedence than = you can use it in condition assignment:which version are you using?If the coding standards for the particular codebase I am writing code for specifies which operator should be used, I\'ll definitely use that. If not, and the code dictates which should be used (not often, can be easily worked around) then I\'ll use that. Otherwise, probably &&.Is \'and\' more readable than \'&&\'?Is it more readable to you. The answer is yes and no depending on many factors including the code around the operator and indeed the person reading it!|| there is ~ difference?Yes. See logical operators for || and bitwise operators for ~.I guess it\'s a matter of taste, although (mistakenly) mixing them up might cause some undesired behaviors:Hence, using && and || is safer for they have the highest precedence. In what regards to readability, I\'d say these operators are universal enough.UPDATE: About the comments saying that both operations return false ... well, in fact the code above does not return anything, I\'m sorry for the ambiguity. To clarify: the behavior in the second case depends on how the result of the operation is used. Observe how the precedence of operators comes into play here:The reason why $a === true is because the assignment operator has precedence over any logical operator, as already very well explained in other answers.Here\'s a little counter example:output:I\'d say this kind of typo is far more likely to cause insidious problems (in much the same way as = vs ==) and is far less likely to be noticed than adn/ro typos which will flag as syntax errors. I also find and/or is much easier to read. FWIW, most PHP frameworks that express a preference (most don\'t) specify and/or. I\'ve also never run into a real, non-contrived case where it would have mattered.
