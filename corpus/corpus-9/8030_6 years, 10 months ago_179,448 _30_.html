I\'m using the following code to make a call in Android but it is giving me security exception please help.permissionsExceptionYou can use Intent.ACTION_DIAL instead of Intent.ACTION_CALL. This shows the dialer with the number already entered, but allows the user to decide whether to actually make the call or not. ACTION_DIAL does not require the CALL_PHONE permission.This demo will helpful for you...On call button click:Permission in Manifest: More elegant option:Every thing is fine.i just placed call permissions tag before application tag in manifest fileand now every thing is working fine.Just the simple oneliner without any additional permissions needed:use this full code Request Permission in manifest For calling use this codePermissions:Intent:You can use this as well:Use the action ACTION_DIAL in your intent, this way you won\'t need any permission. The reason you need the permission with ACTION_CALL is to make a phone call without any action from the user.To avoid this - one can use the GUI for entering permissions. Eclipse take care of where to insert the permission tag and more often then not is correctIn Android for certain functionalities you need to add the permission to the Manifest file.6.Save the manifest file and then run your project.\nYour project now should run as expected.^ The answer lies in the exception output "requires android.permission.CALL_PHONE" :)If you use Intent.ACTION_CALL you must add CALL_PHONE permission. Its okey only if you don\'t want your app to show up for tablets that doesn\'t take SIM card or doesn\'t have GSM.So if it is not critical feature to your app, try to stay away from adding CALL_PHONE permission.Is to show the Phone app with the number written in on the screen, so user will only need to click call button:No permission needed for this.I think you just need to add a permission in your manifest:this will get rid of your security exception.
