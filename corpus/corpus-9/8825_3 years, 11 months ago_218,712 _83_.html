I\'m trying to make two-column full-height layout with twitter bootstrap 3. It seems that twitter bootstrap 3 does not support full height layouts.\nWhat I want to do:If the content grows, the nav should also grow. html:Is there way to make it with default twitter bootstrap 3 classes?Edit:\nIn Bootstrap 4, native classes can produce full-height columns (DEMO) because they changed their grid system to flexbox. (Read on for Bootstrap 3)\nBootply demo / CodepenThe above code will achieve full-height columns (due to the custom css-table properties which we added) and with ratio 1:3 (Navigation:Content) for medium screen widths and above - (due to bootstrap\'s default classes: col-md-3 and col-md-9) NB: 1) In order not to mess up bootstrap\'s native column classes we add another class like no-float in the markup and only set display:table-cell and float:none on this class (as apposed to the column classes themselves).2) If we only want to use the  css-table code for a specific break-point (say medium screen widths and above) but for mobile screens we want to default back to the usual bootstrap behavior than we can wrap our custom CSS within a media query, say:Now, for smaller screens, the columns will behave like default bootstrap columns (each getting full width).3) If the 1:3 ratio is necessary for all screen widths - then it\'s probably a better to remove bootstrap\'s col-md-* classes from the markup because that\'s not how they are meant to be used.You can achieve what you want with the padding-bottom: 100%; margin-bottom: -100%; trick, has you can see in this fiddle.I change your HTML a little bit, but you can achieve the same result with your own HTML with the following codeWorking FiddleUsing CSS2.1 only, Work with all browsers (IE8+), without specifying any height or width.That means that if your header suddenly grows longer, or your left navigation needs to enlarge, you don\'t have to fix anything in your CSS.Totally responsive, simple & clear and very easy to manage.Explanation:\nThe container div takes 100% height of the body, and he\'s divided into 2 sections.\nThe header section will span to its needed height, and the HeightTaker will take the rest.\nHow is it achieved? by floating an empty element along side the container with 100% height (using :before), and giving the HeightTaker an empty element at the end with the clear rule (using :after). that element cant be in the same line with the floated element, so he\'s pushed till the end. which is exactly the 100% of the document.With that we make the HeightTaker span the rest of the container height, without stating any specific height/ margin.inside that HeightTaker we build a normal floated layout (to achieve the column like display) with a minor change.. we have a Wrapper element, that is needed for the 100% height to work.Here\'s the Demo with Bootstrap classes. (I just added one div to your layout)I thought about a subtle change, which doesn\'t change the default bootstrap behavior.\nAnd I can use it only when I needed it:so I can have use it like this:To my knowledge you can use up to 5 methods to accomplish this:Bootstrap: I don\'t have much experience with it but I don\'t think they provide styles for that.A pure CSS solution is easy enough and it works like a charm cross browser.   You simply add a large padding and an equally large negative margin to the nav and content columns, then wrap their row in a class with overflow hidden.\nLive view\nEdit view HTML CSS Good luck!The solution can be achieved in two waysThe classes which are used to obtain the above solution are not provided in bootstrap 3.\ndisplay:table and display:table-cell are given but only when using tables in HTML.\nnegative margin and padding classes are also not there.Hence we have to use custom css to achieve this.The below is the first solutionHTML code:the corresponding css:The below is the second solutionHTML code:the corresponding css:Ok, I\'ve achieved the same thing using Bootstrap 3.0Example with the latest bootstraphttp://jsfiddle.net/HDNQS/1/The HTML:The SCSS:So it seems your best option is going with the padding-bottom countered by negative margin-bottom strategy.I made two examples. One with <header> inside .container, and another with it outside.Both versions should work properly. Note the use of the following @media query so that it removes the extra padding on smaller screens...Other than that, those examples should fix your problem.there\'s a much easier way of doing this if all you\'re concerned about is laying down the colour.Put this either first or last in your body tagand this in your cssyou\'re just creating a shape, pinning it behind the page and stretching it to full height.  By making use of the existing bootstrap classes, you\'ll get the right width and it\'ll stay responsive.There are some limitations with this method ofc, but if it\'s for the page\'s root structure, it\'s the best answer.trycss for .fill class is belowFor your reference just look into the fiddle.try this Visit http://www.sitepoint.com/building-responsive-websites-using-twitter-bootstrap/Thanks to Syed I wrote a simple CSS compatible with Bootstrap to create full width and height tables:Fiddle : https://jsfiddle.net/uasbfc5e/4/The principle is :The HTML :The CSS:If there will be no content after the row (whole screen height is taken), the trick with using position: fixed; height: 100% for .col:before element may work well:Try thisThis uses Bootstrap 3 so no need for extra CSS etc...Have you seen the  the bootstrap\'s afix  in the JAvascript\'s section ???I think it would be the best & easiest solution dude.Have a look there : http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#affixAfter experimenting with the code provided here: Bootstrap TutorialHere is another alternative using latest Bootstrap v3.0.2:Markup: Additional CSS:Sample JSFiddleHope this helps anyone interested.This was not mentioned here with offsetting.You can use absolute to position for the left sidebar.CSSHTML
