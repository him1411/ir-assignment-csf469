I have accidentally committed the .idea/ directory into git. This is causing conflicts everywhere else I need to checkout my repo. I was wondering how do I remove these files from the remote?I still need these files locally since the intellij IDE needs them. I just dont want them in the remote. I have added the directory .idea/ to my .gitignore and committed and pushed this file into remote. This seems to have no effect during my checkout on my other machine though. I still get the error message:First, add it to .gitignore, so it is not accidentally committed by you (or someone else) again:Second, remove the directory only from the repository, but do not delete it locally. To achieve that, do what is listed here:Remove a file from a Git repository without deleting it from the local filesystemThird, commit the .gitignore file and the removal of .idea from the repository. After that push it to the remote(s).The full process would look like this:(optionally you can replace last line with git push some_remote, where some_remote is the name of the remote you want to push to)You can remove it from the repo and commit the change.After that, you can push it to the remote and every checkout/clone after that will be ok.
