I\'m trying to insert a certain number of indentations before a string based on an items depth and I\'m wondering if there is a way to return a string repeated X times.  Example:If you only intend to repeat the same character you can use the string constructor that accepts a char and the number of times to repeat it new String(char c, int count).For example, to repeat a dash five times:If you\'re using .NET 4.0, you could use string.Concat together with Enumerable.Repeat.Otherwise I\'d go with something like Adam\'s answer.The reason I generally wouldn\'t advise using Andrey\'s answer is simply that the ToArray() call introduces superfluous overhead that is avoided with the StringBuilder approach suggested by Adam. That said, at least it works without requiring .NET 4.0; and it\'s quick and easy (and isn\'t going to kill you if efficiency isn\'t too much of a concern).Use String.PadLeft, if your desired string contains only a single char.Credit due heremost performant solution for stringI would go for Dan Tao\'s answer, but if you\'re not using .NET 4.0 you can do something like that:I like the answer given. Along the sames lines though is what I\'ve used in the past:"".PadLeft(3*Indent,\'-\')This will fulfill creating an indent but technically the question was to repeat a string. If the string indent is something like >-< then this as well as the accepted answer would not work. In this case c0rd\'s solution using stringbuilder looks good, though the overhead of stringbuilder may in fact not make it the most performant. One option is to build an array of strings, fill it with indent strings, then concat that. To whit:We all love a clever solution but sometimes simple is best. Surprised nobody went old-school. I am not making any claims about this code, but just for fun:Not sure how this would perform, but it\'s an easy piece of code.  (I have probably made it appear more complicated than it is.) Alternatively, if you know the maximum number of levels you can expect, you could just declare an array and index into it.  You would probably want to make this array static or a constant.I don\'t have enough rep to comment on Adam\'s answer, but the best way to do it imo is like this:You must check to see if numTimes is greater then zero, otherwise you will get an exception.Another approach is to consider string as  IEnumerable<char> and have a generic extension method which will multiply the items in a collection by the specified factor.So in your case:You can create an ExtensionMethod to do that!Or using @Dan Tao solution:
