I installed Docker-Toolbox just now while following their webpage I started with Docker QuickStart Terminal and see followingBut when I try to perform docker pull hello-world, this is what I see  What\'s wrong?I had the same problem this morning and the following fixed it for me:It appears that this is due to the Docker virtual machine getting itself into a strange state. There is an open github issue hereI installed Docker without the Toolbox on Windows 10, so the version that requires Hyper-V to be enabled.For Docker version 1.12 I had to go into the taskbar, right click the Docker Icon, select Settings -> Network and set the DNS Server to fixed, so that is uses Google\'s DNS server at 8.8.8.8.Once that setting was changed, it finally worked.The simpler solution is to add the following entry in /etc/default/docker fileexport http_proxy="http://HOST:PORT/"and restart the docker service  service docker restart Update August 2016Using Docker for Mac (version 1.12.0), was seeing issues of the form:This was resolved by updating my MacBook Pro wireless network settings to include the following DNS entry: 8.8.8.8For further info, please see this (dated) issue which provided the answer given here.I ran into this problem running Docker on my MAC(host) with Docker VM in VBOX 5.10.  It is a networking issue. The simple fix is to add a bridged network to the VBOX image. You can use the included NAT config present with the VM, but you need to change the ssh port from 50375 to 2375.works for me..somehow, sudo service docker restart didn\'t work(RHEL7)I ran into this exact same problem yesterday and none of the "popular" answers (like fixing DNS to 8.8.8.8) worked for me. I eventually happened across this link, and that did the trick ... https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/16Between Docker for Windows, Windows 10 and Hyper-V, there seems to be a problem during the virtual network adapter creation process. Specifically, you might end up with two "vEthernet (DockerNAT)" network adapters. Check this with Get-NetAdapter "vEthernet (DockerNAT)" (in an elevated PowerShell console). If the result shows more than one adapter, you can disable and rename it with:Then open up Device Manager and delete the disabled adapter (for some reason you can do this from here, but not from the Network and Sharing Center adapters view).I assume that you have a network problem. Are you behind a proxy? Is it possible that it filters the connection to docker.io or blocks the docker user agent? I installed the toolbox and ran your test. It works fine, here:On Windows 10. Just right-click on the systray docker icon-> Settings... -> Rest -> Restrart DockerLogon to default machineUpdate profile to update proxy settingsAppend from the below as appropriateExitRestart docker machineUpdate environment settingsAbove steps are slightly tweaked but as given in troubleshooting guide: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/faqs/troubleshoot/#/update-varlibboot2dockerprofile-on-the-docker-machineI had this same problem with boot2docker and fixed it by restarting it with:I just ran into this today with 1.10.1 and none of the existing solutions worked. I tried to restart, upgrade, regenerate certs, ...I noticed that I had a lot of networks created on the machine. After removing them with:The DNS started working again.Note: You may ignore errors about pre-defined networksIf you are behind proxy it is not enough to set HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY env. You should set it while machine creation.Paramer for this is --engine-env:In my case, installing docker on Alpine Linux I get the error:Network timed out while trying to connect to https://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/library/........Using the script here:\nhttps://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/contrib/download-frozen-image-v2.shWorks. It downloads the image using curl and then shows you how to untar and \'docker load\' it.I tried the above methods of static DNS at 8.8.8.8 and disabling ipv6 (I didn\'t understand the proxy thing) and none of them worked for me.EDIT 9/8/2016:I was initially using dropbear instead of openssh. Reinstalled Alpine with openssh fixed the problem.The next problem was \'ApplyLayer exit status 1 stdout: stderr: chmod /bin/mount: permission denied\' error during pull.From (nixaid.com/grsec-in-docker/):To build the Docker image, I had to disable the following grsec\n  protections. Modify the /etc/sysctl.d/grsec.conf as follows:kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_chmod = 0\n  kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_mknod = 0\n  kernel.grsecurity.chroot_caps = 0        # related to a systemd package/CAP_SETFCAPin alpine\'s case though it\'s /etc/sysctl.d/00-alpine.confrebootRestarting Docker or recreating the image did not help. I rebooted Windows to no avail.Astoundingly, when I ssh\'ed into the running container and did curl https://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/library/hello-world/images I got a perfectly valid response. I used the Docker Toolbox with VirtualBox on 64bit Windows 10 Pro.The solution in my case was to uninstall the old Docker version and install the new one that uses Hyper-V instead of VirtualBox.Now Docker works again.If you are behind proxy kindly use below commandsTry this if you can fetch latest ubuntu Unable to find image ubuntu:latest locallylatest: Pulling from library/ubuntu b3e1c725a85f: Pull complete 4daad8bdde31: Pull complete 63fe8c0068a8: Pull complete 4a70713c436f: Pull complete bd842a2105a8: Pull complete Digest: sha256:7a64bc9c8843b0a8c8b8a7e4715b7615e4e1b0d8ca3c7e7a76ec8250899c397aStatus: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latestIt worked for me finally :)Another scenario: if your docker network adapter is disabled, it will fail with this error. The adapter is named "vEthernet (DockerNAT)" or similar. Apparently this adapter is involved somehow in the normal docker pull behavior. Enable it back to solve the problem.On Windows this happened when I moved from a work network to a home network.To solve it, run:
