Could you explain me the correct manner to manage the UIViewController lifecycle?In particular, I would like to know how to use Initialize, ViewDidLoad, ViewWillAppear, ViewDidAppear, ViewWillDisappear, ViewDidDisappear, ViewDidUnload and Dispose methods in Mono Touch for a UIViewController class.All these commands are called automatically at the appropriate times by iOS when you load/present/hide the view controller. It\'s important to note that these methods are attached to UIViewController and not to UIViews themselves. You won\'t get any of these features just using a UIView.There\'s great documentation on Apple\'s site here. Putting in simply though:ViewDidLoad - Called when you create the class and load from xib. Great for initial setup and one-time-only work.ViewWillAppear - Called right before your view appears, good for hiding/showing fields or any operations that you want to happen every time before the view is visible. Because you might be going back and forth between views, this will be called every time your view is about to appear on the screen.ViewDidAppear - Called after the view appears - great place to start an animations or the loading of external data from an API.ViewWillDisappear/DidDisappear - Same idea as ViewWillAppear/ViewDidAppear.ViewDidUnload/ViewDidDispose - In Objective C, this is where you do your clean-up and release of stuff, but this is handled automatically so not much you really need to do here.The UIViewController lifecycle is diagrammed here: http://rdkw.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/ios-uiviewcontroller-lifecycle/This is for latest iOS Versions. Mainly there are six different stages which makes the lifecycle of a UIViewController. I have listed them according to the order. loadViewviewDidLoadviewWillAppearviewWillLayoutSubviewsviewDidLayoutSubviewsviewDidAppearLet me explain all those stages. This event creates the view that the controller manages. It is only called when the view controller is created programmatically. This makes it a good place to create your views in code. The viewDidLoad event is only called when the view is created and loaded into memory. But the bounds for the view are not defined yet. This is a good place to initialize the objects that the view controller is going to use. This event notifies the view controller whenever the view appears on the screen. In this step the view has bounds that are defined but the orientation is not set. This is the first step in the lifecycle where the bounds are finalized. If you are not using constraints or Auto Layout you probably want to update the subviews here. This event notifies the view controller that the subviews have been setup. It is a good place to make any changes to the subviews after they have been set. The viewDidAppear event fires after the view is presented on the screen. Which makes it a good place to get data from a backend service or database.Hope this helped.\nThanks.As of iOS 6 and onward. The new diagram is as follows:Haider\'s answer is correct for pre-iOS 6.  However, as of iOS 6 viewDidUnload and viewWillUnload are never called.  The docs state: "Views are no longer purged under low-memory conditions and so this method is never called."The methods viewWillLayoutSubviews and viewDidLayoutSubviews aren\'t mentioned in the diagrams, but these are called between viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear.  They can be called multiple times.There\'s a lot of outdated and incomplete information here. For iOS 6 and newer only:\nFootnotes:\n\n(a) - If you manually nil out your view during didReceiveMemoryWarning, loadView and viewDidLoad will be called again. That is, by default loadView and viewDidLoad only gets called once per view controller instance.\n\n(b) May be called an additional 0 or more times.\nLet\'s concentrate on methods, which are responsible for the UIViewController\'s lifecycle:Creation:- (void)init- (void)initWithNibName:View creation:- (BOOL)isViewLoaded- (void)loadView- (void)viewDidLoad- (UIView *)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame- (UIView *)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coderHandling of view state changing: - (void)viewDidLoad- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated- (void)viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated- (void)viewDidDisappear:(BOOL)animated- (void)viewDidUnloadMemory warning handling:- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarningDeallocation- (void)viewDidUnload- (void)deallocFor more information please take a look on UIViewController Class Reference.Explaining State Transitions in the official doc: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIViewController_Class/index.htmlThis image shows the valid state transitions between various view \xe2\x80\x98will\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98did\xe2\x80\x99 callback methodsWhen you create the views of your app in a Storyboard, init(coder:) is the method that gets called to instantiate your view controller and bring it to life. The contract for this method is actually defined in the NSCoding protocol, so you won\xe2\x80\x99t see it in the UIViewController documentation.When this method is called, your view will likely be displayed sometime in the near future (or the very immediate future), but at this point there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee that it actually will be displayed. So this might be a good time to start getting things in order, but don\xe2\x80\x99t too much here or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be wasting processing power. In this method, you might instantiate dependencies, including subviews that you\xe2\x80\x99ll add to your view programmatically. And note that init(coder:) is called only once during the life of the object, as all init methods are.Called after init(coder:) when the view is loaded into memory, this method is also called only once during the life of the view controller object. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great place to do any view initialization or setup you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do in the Storyboard. Perhaps you want to add subviews or auto layout constraints programmatically \xe2\x80\x93 if so, this is a great place to do either of those. Note that just because the view has been loaded into memory doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be displayed soon \xe2\x80\x93 for that, you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to look at viewWillAppear. Oh, and remember to call super.viewDidLoad() in your implementation to make sure your superclass\xe2\x80\x99s viewDidLoad gets a chance to do its work \xe2\x80\x93 I usually call super right at the beginning of the implementation.Always called after viewDidLoad (for obvious reasons, if you think about it), and just before the view appears on the screen to the user, viewWillAppear is called. This gives you a chance to do any last-minute view setup, kick off a network request (in another class, of course), or refresh the screen. Unlike viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear is called the first time the view is displayed as well as when the view is displayed again, so it can be called multiple times during the life of the view controller object. It\xe2\x80\x99s called when the view is about to appear as a result of the user tapping the back button, closing a modal dialog, when the view controller\xe2\x80\x99s tab is selected in a tab bar controller, or a variety of other reasons. Make sure to call super.viewWillAppear() at some point in the implementation\xe2\x80\x94I generally do it first thing.Similar to viewWillAppear, this method is called just before the view disappears from the screen. And like viewWillAppear, this method can be called multiple times during the life of the view controller object. It\xe2\x80\x99s called when the user navigates away from the screen\xe2\x80\x94perhaps dismissing the screen, selecting another tab, tapping a button that shows a modal view, or navigating further down the navigation hierarchy. This is a great place to hide the keyboard, save state, and possibly cancel running timers or network requests. Like the other methods in the view controller lifecycle, be sure to call super at some point in viewWillDisappear.iOS 10 Swift 3.1According to UIViewController in UIKit developers,1. loadView()This is where subclasses should create their custom view hierarchy if they aren\'t using a nib. Should never be called directly.2. loadViewIfNeeded()Loads the view controller\'s view if it has not already been set.3. viewDidLoad()Called after the view has been loaded. For view controllers created in code, this is after -loadView. For view controllers unarchived from a nib, this is after the view is set.4. viewWillLayoutSubviews()Called just after the view controller\'s view\'s layoutSubviews method is invoked. Subclasses can implement as necessary.5. viewDidLayoutSubviews()Called when the size,position and constraints are applied to the all objects.6. viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool)Called when the view is about to made visible. Default does nothing7. viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool)Called when the view has been fully transitioned onto the screen. Default does nothing8. viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool)Called when the view is dismissed, covered or otherwise hidden. Default does nothing9. viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool)Called after the view was dismissed, covered or otherwise hidden. Default does nothing10. viewWillTransition(to size: CGSize, with coordinator: UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator)Called when the view is Transitioning.11. willMove(toParentViewController parent: UIViewController?)12. didMove(toParentViewController parent: UIViewController?)These two methods are public for container subclasses to call when transitioning between child controllers. If they are overridden, the overrides should ensure to call the super. The parent argument in both of these methods is nil when a child is being removed from its parent; otherwise it is equal to the new parent view controller.13. didReceiveMemoryWarning()Called when the parent application receives a memory warning. On iOS 6.0 it will no longer clear the view by default.
