This question already has an answer here:I\'d like to find all occurrences of a particular string in all the code files of a project of mine. Search/replace panels popping up on Ctrl+F/Ctrl+R don\'t seem to offer to chose the search domain. Is there such a facility available in IntelliJ Idea?Find in path: Ctrl + Shift + F.To clarify, the default Keymap for Find in Path on Mac OS X is also Ctrl + Shift + FFor mac users, find in path is: \xe2\x8c\x98 + \xe2\x87\xa7 + F (Command + Shift + F).
