How do I optionally include an element in JSX?  Here is an example using a banner that should be in the component if it has been passed in.  What I want to avoid is having to duplicate HTML tags in the if statement.Just leave banner as being undefined and it does not get included.What about this. Let\'s define a simple helping If component. And use it this way:UPDATE: As my answer is getting popular, I feel obligated to warn you about the biggest danger related to this solution. As pointed out in another answer, the code inside the <If /> component is executed always regardless of whether the condition is true or false. Therefore the following example will fail in case the banner is null (note the property access on the second line):You have to be careful when you use it. I suggest reading other answers for alternative (safer) approaches.UPDATE 2: Looking back, this approach is not only dangerous but also desperately cumbersome. It\'s a typical example of when a developer (me) tries to transfer patterns and approaches he knows from one area to another but it doesn\'t really work (in this case other template languages).If you need a conditional element, do it like this:If you also need the else branch, just use a ternary operator: It\'s way shorter, more elegant and safe. I use it all the time. The only disadvantage is that you cannot do else if branching that easily but that is usually not that common.Anyway, this is possible thanks to how logical operators in JavaScript work. The logical operators even allow little tricks like this:Personally, I really think the ternary expressions show in http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/if-else-in-JSX.html are the most natural way that conforms with the ReactJs standards.See the following example. It\'s a little messy at first sight but works quite well.The If style component is dangerous because the code block is always executed regardless of the condition. For example, this would cause a null exception if banner is null:Another option is to use an inline function (especially useful with else statements):Another option from react issues:You may also write it like { this.state.banner && <div>{...}</div> }If your state.banner is null or undefined, the right side of the condition is skipped.This simple test syntax + code-style convention + small focused components is for me the most readable option out there. You just need to take special care of falsy values like false, 0 or "".ES7 stage-0 do notation syntax is also very nice and I\'ll definitively use it when my IDE supports it correctly:More details here: ReactJs - Creating an "If" component... a good idea?Simple, create a function.This is a pattern I personally follow all the time. Makes code really clean and easy to understand. Whatsmore it allows you to refactor Banner into its own component if it gets too large (or re-used in other places).The experimental ES7 do syntax makes this easy. If you\'re using Babel, enable the es7.doExpressions feature then:See http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:do_expressionsAs already mentioned in the answers, JSX presents you with two optionsTernary operator{ this.state.price ? <div>{this.state.price}</div> : null }Logical conjunction{ this.state.price && <div>{this.state.price}</div> }However, those don\'t work for price == 0. JSX will render the false branch in the first case and in case of logical conjunction, nothing will be rendered. If the property may be 0, just use if statements outside of your JSX.This component works when you have more than one element inside "if" branch:Usage:P.s. someone think that this components are not good for code reading. But in my mind html with javascript is worse Most examples are with one line of "html" that is rendered conditionally. This seems readable for me when I have multiple lines that needs to be rendered conditionally.First example is good because instead of null we can conditionally render some other content like {this.props.showContent ? content : otherContent}But if you just need to show/hide content this is even better since Booleans, Null, and Undefined Are IgnoredThere is another solution, if component for React:I use a more explicit shortcut: A Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):I made https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsx-control-statements to make it a bit easier, basically it allows you to define <If> conditionals as tags and then compiles them into ternary ifs so that the code inside the <If> only gets executed if the condition is true.I made https://github.com/ajwhite/render-if recently to safely render elements only if the predicate passes.orYou can conditionally include elements using the ternary operator like so:You can use a function and return the component and keep thin the render functionMaybe it helps someone who comes across the question: All the Conditional Renderings in React It\'s an article about all the different options for conditional rendering in React. Key takeaways of when to use which conditional rendering:** if-else** ternary operator** logical && operator** switch case** enums** multi-level/nested conditional renderings** HOCs** external templating componentsThere is also a really clean one line version... { this.props.product.title || "No Title" }Ie:I don\'t think this has been mentioned. This is like your own answer but I think it\'s even simpler. You can always return strings from the expressions and you can nest jsx inside expressions, so this allows for an easy to read inline expression.I like the explicitness of Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) and if-else over render callbacks and ternary operators.You just need to get acquainted of the IIFE syntax, {expression} is the usual React syntax, inside it just consider that you\'re writing a function that is invoking itself.that need to be wrapped inside parensHere is my approach using ES6. Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/kb3gN/16688/I\'m using code like:That will render SomeElement only if opened is true. It works because of the way how JavaScript resolve logical conditions:As React will ignore false, I find it very good way to conditionally render some elements.Just to add another option - if you like/tolerate coffee-script you can use coffee-react to write your JSX in which case if/else statements are usable as they are expressions in coffee-script and not statements:Just to extend @Jack Allan answer with references to docs.React basic (Quick Start) documentation suggests null in such case. \nHowever, Booleans, Null, and Undefined Are Ignored as well, mentioned in Advanced guide.
