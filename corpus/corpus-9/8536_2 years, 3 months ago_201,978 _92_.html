Can anyone tell me, how to use jQuery with Angular?I\'m aware there are workarounds like manipulating the class or id of the DOM element upfront, but I\'m hoping for a cleaner way of doing it.Using jQuery from Angular2 is a breeze compared to ng1. If you are using TypeScript you could first reference jQuery typescript definition.TypescriptDefinitions are not required since you could just use any as the type for $ or jQueryIn your angular component you should reference a DOM element from the template using @ViewChild() After the view has been initialized you can use the nativeElement property of this object and pass to jQuery.Declaring $ (or jQuery) as JQueryStatic will give you a typed reference to jQuery. This example is available on plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/Nq9LnK?p=previewtslint will complain about chosen not being a property on $, to fix this you can add a definition to the JQuery interface in your custom *.d.ts fileWhy is everyone making it a rocket science?\nFor anyone else who needs to do some basic stuff on static elements, for example, body tag, just do this:This is what worked for me.Lately, I\'m writing code with ES6 instead of typescript and am able to import without * as $ in the import statement.   This is what it looks like now:Good Luck.Now it has become very easy, You can do it by simply declaring jQuery variable with any type inside Angular2 controller.Add this just after import statements and before component decorator.To access any element with id X or Class X you just have to doPlease follow these simple steps. It worked for me. Lets start with a new angular 2 app to avoid any confusion. I\'m using Angular cli. So, install it if you don\'t have it already.\nhttps://cli.angular.io/Step 1: Create a demo angular 2 appyou can use any name. Now check if it is working by running below cmd.(Now, make sure that you are pointing to \'jquery-demo\' if not use cd command )you will see "app works!" on browser.Step 2: Install Bower (A package manager for the web)Run this command on cli (make sure that you are pointing to \'jquery-demo\' if not use cd command ):Now after successful installation of bower, Create a \'bower.json\' file by using below command:It will ask for inputs, just press enter for all if you want default values and at the end type "Yes" when it\'ll ask "Looks good?"Now you can see a new file (bower.json) in folder "jquery-demo". You can find more info on https://bower.io/Step 3: Install jqueryRun this commandIt will create a new folder (bower_components) which will contain jquery installation folder. Now you have jquery installed in \'bower_components\' folder.Step 4: Add jquery location in \'angular-cli.json\' fileOpen \'angular-cli.json\' file (present in \'jquery-demo\' folder) and add jquery location in "scripts". It will look like this:Step 5: Write simple jquery code for testingOpen \'app.component.html\' file and add a simple code line, The file will look like this:Now Open \'app.component.ts\' file and add jquery variable declaration and code for \'p\' tag. You should use lifecycle hook ngAfterViewInit() also. After making changes the file will look like this:Now run your angular 2 app by using \'ng serve\' command and test it. It should work.You can implement the lifecycle hook ngAfterViewInit() to add some DOM manipulationsBe careful when using router because angular2 may recycle views .. so you have to be sure that the DOM elements manipulations are done only in the first call of afterViewInit .. ( You can use static boolean variables to do so )I do it in simpler way - first install jquery by npm in console: npm install jquery -S and then in component file I just write: let $ = require(\'.../jquery.min.js\') and it works! Here full example from some my code:In teplate I have for instance:EDITAlternatively instead of using:useand in your index.html put:This will initialize jquery only once globaly - this is important for instance for use modal windows in bootstrap...//installing jquerynpm install jquery --save//installing type defintion for the jquerytypings install dt~jquery --global --save//adding jquery library into build configuration file as specified(in "angular-cli-build.js" file)//run the build to add the jquery library in the build   ng build//adding the relative path configuration(in system-config.js)\n /** Map relative paths to URLs. */\n    const map: any = {\n    .....,\n    .......,\n    \'jquery\': \'vendor/jquery/dist\'\n   };//import the jquery library in your component filebelow is the code snipppet of my sample componentA simple way:1. include scriptindex.html2. declaremy.component.ts3. useSince I\'m a dunce, I thought it would be good to have some working code.  Also, Angular2 typings version of angular-protractor has issues with the jQuery $, so the top accepted answer doesn\'t give me a clean compile. Here are the steps that I got to be working:  index.htmlInside my.component.tsTo Use Jquery in Angular2(4) Follow these setpsinstall the Jquery and Juqry type defination For Jquery Installation npm install jquery --saveFor Jquery Type defination Installation  npm install @types/jquery --save-devand then simply import the jquery just write declare var $:any; after all import section you can use jquery and include jquery library in index.html pageit works for me If you use angular-cli you can do : Install the dependency : npm install jquery --savenpm install @types/jquery --save-devImport the file : Add "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js" to the "script" section in .angular-cli.json fileDeclare jquery :Add "$" to the "types" section of tsconfig.app.jsonYou can find more details on official angular cli doc\n1) To access DOM in component.You can include jQuery in following way. \n2) Include you jquery file in index.html before angular2 loadsYou can use Jquery in following way, Here i am using JQuery Ui date picker.This work for me.The most effective way that I have found is to use setTimeout with time of 0 inside of the page/component constructor. This let\'s the jQuery run in the next execution cycle after Angular has finished loading all the child components. A few other component methods could be used but all I have tried work best when run inside a setTimeout.You could also try to import it with the "InjectionToken". \nAs described here: Use jQuery in Angular/Typescript without a type definitionYou can simply inject the jQuery global instance and use it. For this you won\'t be needing any type definitions or typings.When set correctly in your app.module.ts:You can start using it in your components:Here is what worked for me - Angular 2 with webpackI tried declaring $ as type any but whenever I tried to use any JQuery module I was getting (for example) $(..).datepicker() is not a functionSince I have Jquery included in my vendor.ts file I simply imported it into my component using import * as $ from \'jquery\';I am able to use Jquery plugins (like bootstrap-datetimepicker) now
