How do I use the UNIX command find to search for files created on a specific date?As pointed out by Max, you can\'t, but checking files modified or accessed is not all that hard.  I wrote a tutorial about this, as late as today. The essence of which is to use -newerXY and ! -newerXY:Example: To find all files modified on the 7th of June, 2007:To find all files accessed on the 29th of september, 2008:Or, files which had their permission changed on the same day:If you don\'t change permissions on the file, \'c\' would normally correspond to the creation date, though.find location -ctime time_periodExamples of time_period:More than 30 days ago: -ctime +30Less than 30 days ago: -ctime -30Exactly 30 days ago: -ctime 30It\'s two steps but I like to do it this way:First create a file with a particular date/time.  In this case, the file is 2008-10-01 at midnight  Now we can find all files that are newer or older than the above file (going by file modified date.  You can also use -anewer for accessed and -cnewer file status changed).You could also look at files between certain dates by creating two files with touchThis will find files between the two dates & timesYou could do this:Example: You can\'t.  The -c switch tells you when the permissions were last changed, -a tests the most recent access time, and -m tests the modification time.  The filesystem used by most flavors of Linux (ext3) doesn\'t support a "creation time" record.  Sorry!@Max: is right about the creation time.However, if you want to calculate the elapsed days argument for one of the -atime, -ctime, -mtime parameters, you can use the following expressionReplace "2008-09-24" with whatever date you want and ELAPSED_DAYS will be set to the number of days between then and today. (Update: subtract one from the result to align with find\'s date rounding.)So, to find any file modified on September 24th, 2008, the command would be:This will work if your version of find doesn\'t support the -newerXY predicates mentioned in @Arve:\'s answer.With the -atime, -ctime, and -mtime switches to find, you can get close to what you want to achieve. I found this scriplet in a script that deletes all files older than 14 days:I think a little additional "man find" and looking for the -ctime / -atime etc. parameters will help you here.
