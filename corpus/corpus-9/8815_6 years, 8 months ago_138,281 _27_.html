Is there a difference between isset and !empty. If I do this double boolean check, is it correct this way or redundant? and is there a shorter way to do the same thing?This is completely redundant. empty is more or less shorthand for !isset($foo) || !$foo, and !empty is analogous to isset($foo) && $foo. I.e. empty does the reverse thing of isset plus an additional check for the truthiness of a value.  Or in other words, empty is the same as !$foo, but doesn\'t throw warnings if the variable doesn\'t exist. That\'s the main point of this function: do a boolean comparison without worrying about the variable being set.The manual puts it like this:empty() is the opposite of (boolean) var, except that no warning is generated when the variable is not set.You can simply use !empty($vars[1]) here.isset() tests if a variable is set and not null:http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.isset.phpempty() can return true when the variable is set to certain values:http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.empty.phpTo demonstrate this, try the following code with $the_var unassigned, set to 0, and set to 1.The accepted answer is not correct.isset() is NOT equivalent to !empty().You will create some rather unpleasant and hard to debug bugs if you go down this route. e.g. try running this code:https://3v4l.org/J4nBbEmpty just check is the refered variable/array has an value if you check the php doc(empty) you\'ll see this things are considered emtpy while isset check if the variable isset and not null which can also be found in the php doc(isset) if we use same page to add/edit via submit button like belowthen we should not use bcoz edit_id is set all the time whether it is add or edit page , instead  we should use  check below condition "Empty": only works on variables. Empty can mean different things for different variable types\n(check manual: http://php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php)."isset": checks if the variable exists and checks for a true NULL or false value.\nCan be unset by calling "unset". Once again, check the manual.Use of either one depends of the variable type you are using. I would say, it\'s safer to check for both, because you are checking first of all if the variable exists, and if it isn\'t really NULL or empty.It is not necessary.No warning is generated if the variable does not exist. That means\n  empty() is essentially the concise equivalent to !isset($var) || $var\n  == false.php.net
