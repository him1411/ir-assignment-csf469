It seems rather odd that I can\'t figure how to do this in mustache. Is it supported?This is my sad attempt at trying:This obviously isn\'t right, but the documentation doesn\'t mention anything like this. The word "else" isn\'t even mentioned :(Also, why is mustache designed this way? Is this sort of thing considered bad? Is it trying to force me to set the default value in the model itself? What about the cases where that isn\'t possible?This is how you do if/else in Mustache (perfectly supported):Or in your case:Look for inverted sections in the docs: https://github.com/janl/mustache.jsThis is something you solve in the "controller", which is the point of logicless templating.This is actually a LOT better then maintaining image url\'s or other media that might or might not change in your templates, but takes some getting used to. The point is to unlearn template tunnel vision, an avatar img url is bound to be used in other templates, are you going to maintain that url on X templates or a single DEFAULTS settings object? ;)Another option is to do the following:And in the template:But that\'s going against the whole meaning of logicless templating. If that\'s what you want to do, you want logical templating and you should not use Mustache, though do give it yourself a fair chance of learning this concept ;)Your else statement should look like this (note the ^):In mustache this is called \'Inverted sections\'.
