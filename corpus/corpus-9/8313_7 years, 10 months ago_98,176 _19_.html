I\'ve seen plenty of examples of people extracting all of the classes from a module, usually something like:Awesome.But I can\'t find out how to get all of the classes from the current module.This is probably something really obvious, but I haven\'t been able to find anything. Can anyone help me out?Try this:In your context:And even better:Because inspect.getmembers() takes a predicate.What about?I don\'t know if there\'s a \'proper\' way to do it, but your snippet is on the right track: just add import foo to foo.py, do inspect.getmembers(foo), and it should work fine.Note that the stdlib\'s Python class browser module uses static source analysis, so it only works for modules that are backed by a real .py file.I was able to get all I needed from the dir built in plus getattr.Though, it does come out looking like a hairball:Another solution which works in Python 2 and 3:If you want to have all the classes, that belong to the current module, you could use this :If you use Nadia\'s answer and you were importing other classes on your module, that classes will be being imported too.So that\'s why member.__module__ == __name__ is being added to the predicate used on is_class_member. This statement checks that the class really belongs to the module.A predicate is a function (callable), that returns a boolean value.
