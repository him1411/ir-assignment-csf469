I have an app in which I have a WebView where I display some websites. It works, clicking a link in the webpage goes to the next page in the website inside my app. But when I click the phone\'s back button, it takes me straight into my app. I want to go back to the previous page in the website  instead. How can I do this?Here is the code sample I\'m using:I use something like this in my activities with WebViews:Edit:For this code to work, you need to add a field to the Activity containing the WebView:Initialize it in the onCreate() method and you should be good to go.If using Android 2.2 and above (which is most devices now), the following code will get you what you want.This is my solution. It works also in Fragment.Why not use onBackPressed()?Focusing should also be checked in onBackPressedhere is a code with confirm exit:If you want to go to back page when click on phone\'s back button, use this:You can also create custom back button like this:Full reference for next button and progress bar : put back and next button in webviewYou should the following libraries on your class handle the onBackKeyPressed.\ncanGoBack() checks whether the webview can reference to the previous page. If it is possible then use the goBack() function to reference the previous page (go back).Webview in Activity,Below  code worked for me , Finish the activity the after load the  Url in webview.in onbackpressed it go to  the  previous activity
