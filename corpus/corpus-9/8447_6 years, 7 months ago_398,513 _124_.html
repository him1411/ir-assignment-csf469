On Snow Leopard, starting MySQL gives the following error:The server quit without updating PID filetry to find your log file with suffix ".err", there should be more info. It might be in:/usr/local/var/mysql/your_computer_name.local.errIt\'s probably problem with permissionscheck if any mysql instance is runningps -ef | grep mysqlif yes, you should stop it, or kill the processkill -9 PID where PID is the number displayed next to username on output of previous commandcheck ownership of /usr/local/var/mysql/ls -laF /usr/local/var/mysql/if it is owner by root you should change it mysql or your_usersudo chown -R mysql /usr/local/var/mysql/ Did you follow the instructions from brew install mysql?Set up databases to run AS YOUR USER ACCOUNT with:To set up base tables in another folder, or use a different user to run\nmysqld, view the help for mysqld_install_db:and view the MySQL documentation:To run as, for instance, user "mysql", you may need to sudo:Start mysqld manually with:Note: if this fails, you probably forgot to run the first two steps up aboveI had the same issue on my Mac machine (correctly followed all the installation steps suggested by brew install).Deleting the error file fixed it for me:sudo rm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql/dev.work.err (dev.work is my hostname)This worked because dev.work.err was owned by _mysql:wheel instead of my own username.\nCHOWN-ing the error file would have probably fixed it as well.After rebooting I had the same issue. Here is how I fixed it:This worked for me...Check all of the MySQL processes running:Then kill all the processes listed from the above command using the following:Replace [PID] with the individual PID from the list above, e.g. 5970.Do that for all of the lines you see with the first command.Then you can startup your MySQL server again:My error file told me also that the port may be being used by another process, but simply running sudo mysql.server start fixed the issue for me.I recently came across this issue, however it was working before, then stopped.This was because I initially started mysql.server as root instead of myself.The fix was to delete the err log file (which was owned by _mysql).  Starting it again got it passed.This error can occur when trying to start msql after it was improperly shutdown.Take a look at the mysql error log file. If it mentions something like "Check that you do not already have another mysqld process using the same data or log files.", then you need to properly shutdown that process.See what process mysql is running on, use this command: lsof -i:3306Your output should look like this: Kill -15 sends a siganl to the process to free up any resources it is locking and terminate the process after. The solution that worked for me was here: https://serverfault.com/questions/334284/cant-create-pid-file-on-mysql-server-permission-deniedChanging some of my permissions seemed to do the trick. I\'m running a Mid-2012 Macbook Air with OS X 10.8.2 and mysql was installed with homebrew.I\'m using, I Installed MySQL using homebrew (\'brew install mysql\'). It installed a couple of dependencies and then mysql.When I tried to start it up, I ran this command, and MySQL works.Please take note that you need to run mysql_install_db from the with top level of the mysql directory (IE, usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.25). Running it directly within the /scripts directory does not give it enough context for it to run.For me the solution was to override/correct the data directory in /etc/my/cnf.I built MySQL 5.5.27 from source with the directions provided in the readme file:mysqld_safe terminated itself without explanation. running /etc/init.d/mysql.server start resulted in the error:"The server quit without updating PID file"I noticed something odd in the installation instructions though. It has ownership changed to mysql for the directory "data", but not to "var"; this is unusual because for years I have had to ensure that var directory was mysql writable. So I manually ran chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/var and then attempted to start it again. Still no luck. But worse, no .err file in the var dir - it was in the "data" dir! so scripts/mysql_install_db sets up camp in /usr/local/mysql/var, but the rest of the application seems to want to do its work in /usr/local/mysql/data!So I just edited /etc/my.cnf and under the section [mysqld] I added a directive to explicitly point mysql\'s data directory to var (as I normally expect it to be any how), and after doing so, mysqld starts up just fine. The directive to add looks like this:datadir         = /usr/local/mysql/varWorked for me. Hope it helps for you.I had this problem while trying to brew upgrade on MacOS X 10.7.5.Unfortunately mysql was also upgraded to 5.6.10 from 5.5.14. Tried the new, did not work.I decided to go back to my old setup and did aThis did not solve the problem. Elsewhere I read and did this, voila! All was back :)It seems that MySQL process is running hence you are unable to use the port. You can check the running MySQL process using following command:ps auxf | grep mysqlIf you get any MySQL process kill that process ID using kill -9 PID and then try to start MySQL.Start Mysql in safe mode OR on MAC End any mysql or mysqld task (or other) in your Activity Monitor application.or check you error byFor me the fix was simple:showed that mysqld was already runningthen allowed the process to startI hope this work for you.After checking the error log, I found this:And to solve it, I gave ownership rights to the entire mysql folder:Then (you can do it command-line too), I applied the permissions (once I gave that ownership to _mysql and mysql users) to all enclosed folders from within the "get info" menu of the folder at /usr/local/mysql-5.5.21-osx10.6-x86_64 . You don\'t need to tho that to the alias since it\'s only an alias.The name of the folder depends of the installation version of mysql that you have.Had the same issue, for me it was doing a brew remove while having a previous install of the mysqld running. Seems brew does not stop a service before uninstalling.After checking the .err file i saw the logged error that another copy of mysql may be running, after terminating the old service. I was then able to restart the new mysql install.Try this.. In my case, the error happens due to the accessing problem of the error log file. These two commands help me address the problem.I had the same problem. moving my /etc/my.cnf file worked for me. I got the information hereSimple....Fix the 2002 MySQL Socket errorFix the looming 2002 socket error \xe2\x80\x93 which is linking where MySQL places the socket and where OSX thinks it should be, MySQL puts it in /tmp and OSX looks for it in /var/mysql the socket is a type of file that allows mysql client/server communication.sudo mkdir /var/mysqlsudo ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock /var/mysql/mysql.sockWell Done : ) This Help me A LOT! \ni took this guide from the guys on http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/The problem is a permissions one, it can\'t start because it can\'t write to mac.err because its owned by someone else.Make sure the /usr/local/var/mysql folder is owned by the user that will start mysql. If I start mysql as jack its all good.  However, if you start it as root, it will create a mac.err (owned by root) file that jack can\'t write to, so when you try to restart it as jack it will fail.What\'s the error log say?  I got this error, and it ended up being an old invalid setting in the my.cnf, which the mysql error log indicated.  If not a bad config setting, the error log should at least point you in the right direction.Well, I assume the OP has fixed it at this point... but hopefully this points the others seeing this error in the right direction.Check if you have space left in your drive. I got this problem when no space left in my drive.In my case, when I tried to start MySQL, I received the same error: The server quit without updating PID file. This is what I did to fix it (using Terminal):Delete *.err files that you find in the directory displayed in the error and create the file mysql is complaining about, restart mysql.Move the log file named \xe2\x80\x9cib_logfile\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9c/var/lib/mysql\xe2\x80\x9d and restart mysql. Sometimes mysql will fail because it faces difficulty updating the log fileYou can also remove ib_logfile as it will be created automatically after mysql restartnow restart mysql serverIn my case, I got this issue on vps, cPanel.I was try most of the above answers, but not success. ERROR!

Hope this can help others here... The key is to read the error and log and find whats is wrong...This problem usually arrives when you did not have libaio.1 library installed. Install that package first and redo the mysql_install_db step.
