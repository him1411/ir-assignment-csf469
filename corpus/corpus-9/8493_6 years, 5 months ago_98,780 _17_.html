I\'ve just started using EF code first, so I\'m total beginner in this topic.I wanted to create relations between Teams and Matches:\n1 match = 2 teams (home, guest) and result. I thought It\'s easy to create such model, so I started coding:And I get an exception : The referential relationship will result in a cyclical reference that is not allowed. [ Constraint name = Match_GuestTeam ]How can I create such model, with 2 foreign keys to same table ?\nTIA.Try this:Primary keys are mapped by default convention. Team must have two collection of matches. You can\'t have single collection referenced by two FKs. Match is mapped without cascading delete because it doesn\'t work in these self referencing many-to-many.It\'s also possible to specify the ForeignKey() attribute on the navigation property:That way you don\'t need to add any code to the OnModelCreate methodI know it\'s a several years old post and you may solve your problem with above solution. However, i just want to suggest using InverseProperty for someone who still need. At least you don\'t need to change anything in OnModelCreating.The below code is un-tested.You can read more about InverseProperty on MSDN: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj591583?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396#RelationshipsYou can try this too:When you make a FK column allow NULLS, you are breaking the cycle. Or we are just cheating the EF schema generator.In my case, this simple modification solve the problem.This is because Cascade Deletes are enabled by default. The problem is that when you call a delete on the entity, it will delete each of the f-key referenced entities as well.  You should not make \'required\' values nullable to fix this problem.  A better option would be to remove EF Code First\'s Cascade delete convention:It\'s probably safer to explicitly indicate when to do a cascade delete for each of the children when mapping/config. the entity.
