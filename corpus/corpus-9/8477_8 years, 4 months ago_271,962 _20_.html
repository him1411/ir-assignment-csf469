I started to use Json.NET to convert a string in JSON format to object or viceversa. I am not sure in the Json.NET framework, is it possible to convert a string in JSON to XML format and viceversa?Yes. Using the JsonConvert class which contains helper methods for this precise purpose:Documentation here: Converting between JSON and XML with Json.NETYes, you can do it (I do) but Be aware of some paradoxes when converting, and handle appropriately. You cannot automatically conform to all interface possibilities, and there is limited built-in support in controlling the conversion- many JSON structures and values cannot automatically be converted both ways. Keep in mind I am using the default settings with Newtonsoft JSON library and MS XML library, so your mileage may vary:Please feel free to mention any other issues you have noticed, I have developed my own custom routines for preparing and cleaning the strings as I convert back and forth. Your situation may or may not call for prep/cleanup. As StaxMan mentions, your situation may actually require that you convert between objects...this could entail appropriate interfaces and a bunch of case statements/etc to handle the caveats I mention above.Thanks for David Brown\'s answer. In my case of JSON.Net 3.5, the convert methods are under the JsonConvert static class:You can do these conversions also with the .NET Framework:JSON to XML: by using System.Runtime.Serialization.JsonXML to JSON: by using System.Web.Script.SerializationI\'m not sure there is point in such conversion (yes, many do it, but mostly to force a square peg through round hole) -- there is structural impedance mismatch, and conversion is lossy. So I would recommend against such format-to-format transformations.But if you do it, first convert from json to object, then from object to xml (and vice versa for reverse direction). Doing direct transformation leads to ugly output, loss of information, or possibly both.I searched for a long time to find alternative code to the accepted solution in the hopes of not using an external assembly/project. I came up with the following thanks to the source code of the DynamicJson project:Note: I wanted an XmlDocument rather than an XElement for xPath purposes.\nAlso, this code obviously only goes from JSON to XML, there are various ways to do the opposite.Here is the full c# code to convert xml to jsonTo convert a given XML string to JSON, simply call XmlToJSON() function as below.Try this function.  I just wrote it and haven\'t had much of a chance to test it, but my preliminary tests are promising.Here is a simple snippet that converts a XmlNode (recursively) into a hashtable, and groups multiple instances of the same child into an array (as an ArrayList).\nThe Hashtable is usually accepted to convert into JSON by most of the JSON libraries.I did like David Brown said but I got the following exception. One solution would be to modify the XML file with a root element but that is not always necessary and for an XML stream it might not be possible either. My solution below:Example XML that generates the error:
