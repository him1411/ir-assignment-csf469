This follows this prior question, which was answered. I actually discovered I could remove a join from that query, so now the working query isThis appears to work. However, when I try to move these DeckCards into another association, I get the ActiveRecord::ReadOnlyRecord error.Here\'s the codeand the relevant Models (tableau are the players cards on the table)I am doing a similar action just after this code, adding DeckCards to the players hand, and that code is working fine. I wondered if I needed belongs_to :tableau in the DeckCard Model, but it works fine for the adding to player\'s hand. I do have a tableau_id and hand_id columns in the DeckCard table.I looked up ReadOnlyRecord in the rails api, and it doesn\'t say much beyond the description.From the ActiveRecord CHANGELOG(v1.12.0, October 16th, 2005):Introduce read-only records.  If you call object.readonly! then it will\n  mark the object as read-only and raise\n  ReadOnlyRecord if you call\n  object.save.  object.readonly? reports\n  whether the object is read-only. \n  Passing :readonly => true to any\n  finder method will mark returned\n  records as read-only.  The :joins\n  option now implies :readonly, so if\n  you use this option, saving the same\n  record will now fail.  Use find_by_sql\n  to work around.Using find_by_sql is not really an alternative as it returns raw row/column data, not ActiveRecords.  You have two options:Sep 2010 UPDATEMost of the above no longer holds true.  Thus, in Rails 2.3.4 and 3.0.0: Or in Rails 3 you can use the readonly method (replace "..." with your conditions):This might have changed in recent release of Rails, but the appropriate way to solve this problem is to add :readonly => false to the find options.select(\'*\') seems to fix this in Rails 3.2:Just to verify, omitting select(\'*\') does produce a readonly record:Can\'t say I understand the rationale but at least it\'s a quick and clean workaround.Instead of find_by_sql, you can specify a :select on the finder and everything\'s happy again...start_cards = DeckCard.find :all, \n  :select => \'deck_cards.*\', \n  :joins => [:card], \n  :conditions => ["deck_cards.deck_id = ? and cards.start_card = ?", @game.deck.id, true]To deactivate it...
