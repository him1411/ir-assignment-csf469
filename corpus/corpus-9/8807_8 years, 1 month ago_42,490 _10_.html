I have a constructor that takes some arguments.  I had assumed that they were constructed in the order listed, but in one case it appears they were being constructed in reverse resulting in an abort. When I reversed the arguments the program stopped aborting.  This is an example of the syntax I\'m using.  The thing is, a_ needs to be initialized before b_ in this case.  Can you guarantee the order of construction? e.g.It depends on the order of member variable declaration in the class. So a_ will be the first one, then b_ will be the second one in your example.To quote the standard, for clarification:12.6.2.5Initialization shall proceed in the following order:......The standard reference for this now appears to be 12.6.2 section 13.3:(13.3) \xe2\x80\x94 Then, non-static data members are initialized in the order they were declared in the class definition\n  (again regardless of the order of the mem-initializers).
