When I updated version of Hibernate from 3.6.8.final to 4.0.0.final I got a warning about deprecated method buildSessionFactory() in this line:the javadoc recommends use of another method buildSessionFactory(ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry)but in the documentation I found deprecated variant :(Can you help me with this little misunderstanding ?Yes it is deprecated. Replace your SessionFactory with the following:In Hibernate 4.0, 4.1, 4.2UPDATE:In Hibernate 4.3 ServiceRegistryBuilder is deprecated. Use the following instead.Yes, it is deprecated.  http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/4.0/javadocs/org/hibernate/cfg/Configuration.html#buildSessionFactory() specifically tells you to use the other method you found instead (buildSessionFactory(ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry)) - so use it.The documentation is copied over from release to release, and likely just hasn\'t been updated yet (they don\'t rewrite the manual with every release) - so trust the Javadocs.The specifics of this change can be viewed at:Some additional references:or It\'s as simple as this: the JBoss docs are not 100% perfectly well-maintained. Go with what the JavaDoc says: buildSessionFactory(ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry).It is not unusual to find discrepancies between different versions of documentation.  Most developers view documentation as a chore, and they tend to put it off.As a rule of thumb, if the javadoc says one thing and some non-javadoc documentation contradicts it, the chances are that the javadoc is more accurate.  Programmers are more likely to keep the javadoc up to date with changes to the code ... because the "source" for the javadoc is in the same file as the code.In the case of @deprecated tags, it is a virtual certainty that the javadoc is more accurate.  Developers deprecate things after careful consideration ... and (generally speaking) they don\'t undeprecate them.Code verified to work in Hibernate 4.3.0. Notice you can remove the XML filename parameter, or else provide your own path there.  This is similar to (but typos corrected) other posts here, but this one is correct.A better way to create SessionFactory object in Latest hibernate release 4.3.0 onward is as follow:If you are using Hibernate 5.2 and above then you can use this:public void sampleConnection() throws Exception {I edited the method created by batbaatar above so it accepts the Configuration object as a parameter:In the main class I did:In Hibernate 4.2.2here are many APIs deprecated in the hibernate core framework.we have created the session factory as below:SessionFactory sessionFactory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory(); The method buildSessionFactory is deprecated from the hibernate 4 release and it is replaced with the new API. If you are using the hibernate 4.3.0 and above, your code has to be:Configuration configuration = new Configuration().configure();StandardServiceRegistryBuilder builder = new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder().applySettings(configuration.getProperties());SessionFactory factory = configuration.buildSessionFactory(builder.build());Class ServiceRegistryBuilder is  replaced by StandardServiceRegistryBuilder from 4.3.0. It looks like there will be lot of changes in the 5.0 release. Still there is not much clarity on the deprecated APIs and the suitable alternatives to use. Every incremental release comes up with more deprecated API, they are in way of fine tuning the core framework for the release 5.0.Just import following package,
