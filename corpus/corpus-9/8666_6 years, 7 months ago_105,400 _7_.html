I have ASP.NET MVC3 app and I have also form for add news. When VS2010 created default view I have only text inputs for string data, but I want to have textarea for news text. How I can do it with Razor syntax.Text input look like this:You could use the [DataType] attribute on your view model like this:and then you could have a controller:and a view which does what you want:Someone asked about adding attributes (specifically, \'rows\' and \'cols\'). If you\'re using Razor, you could just do this:That works for me. The \'@\' is used to escape keywords so they are treated as variables/properties.
