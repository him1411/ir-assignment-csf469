It seems like you have to interact with github.com to initiate a pull request. Is this so?Seems like a particularly useful thing to add to the hub command: http://github.com/defunkt/hub or the github gem: http://github.com/defunkt/github-gemI suggest filing an issue with those projects asking for it. The github guys are pretty responsive.It looks like this is now supported out of the box with the command \'git request-pull\' [-p] <start> <url> [<end>]You can see the docs hereWith the Hub command-line wrapper you can link it to git and then you can do \ngit pull-requestFrom the man page of hub:A man search like...GivesBut, despite the name, I\'m not sure this does what you want.\nHolger\'s suggestion seems to work:But you\'ll need to install the github client (gh) first. On ubuntu this is:I ended up making my own, I find that it works better the other solutions that were around.https://npmjs.org/package/pullrThis answer is an alternative way to the existing use of git request-pull command. Using this approach, you would not be creating the pull request directly from the command line, but rather, from the command line, it would make it faster and easier to create the pull request on github by removing few steps.I don\'t use the request-pull command for two reasons:Why not we automate creating a tab to compare the current branch with another using the existing compare functionality of github?I have created a shell script for that, and created an alias that points to that shell script:note: USERACCOUTN and REPOSITORY-NAME need to be changed to yours.lets put this script in a file called create-pull-request.sh. then we could just create an alias for running the script by adding this one line to your .bashrc file :I\'ve used this tool before- although it seems like there needs to be an issue open first, it is super useful and really streamlines workflow if you use github issue tracking. git open-pull and then a pull request is submitted from whatever branch you are on or select. \nhttps://github.com/jehiah/git-open-pullEDIT: Looks like you can create issues on the fly, so this tool is a good solution. I\'ve created a tool recently that does exactly what you want:https://github.com/jd/git-pull-requestIt automates everything in a single command, forking the repo, pushing the PR etc. It also supports updating the PR if you need to edit/fix it!
