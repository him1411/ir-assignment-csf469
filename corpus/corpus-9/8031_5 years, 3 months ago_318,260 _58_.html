Buiding MVC3 solution went well but have got an error in browser:Compiler Error Message: CS0234: The type or namespace name \'Html\' does not exist in the namespace \'System.Web.Mvc\' (are you missing an assembly reference?)I have installed packets for the solution with NuGet and set up for all projects MVC3. Does MVC3 include libraries System.Web.Mvc.Ajax,  System.Web.Mvc.Html and others? Why am I getting the error?In References folder, I have System.Web.MvcRuntime version: v4.0.30319,Web.configMSDN the System.Web.Mvc namespacefile packages.config:Clean your solution and then set the property of those files to Copy Local = True.To set the Copy Local property to True or FalseIn Solution Explorer, click the Show All Files button to display the References node.For whatever reason, TWO of my solutions have web projects that spontaneously uninstalled asp.net MVC somehow. I installed it from Nuget and now they both work again. This happened after a recent batch of windows updates that included .net framework updates for the version I was using (4.5.1).Edit: From the .Net Web Development and Tools Blog:Microsoft Asp.Net MVC Security Update MS14-059 broke my build!This one normally catches me when I run from IIS and the app pool for the default site is set to .NET version 2.0. When using IIS from visual studio it creates a virtual directory but still runs under the default site\'s app pool.\nIf using the build in web server, right click on your web project, go to properties and make sure you\'re running it under the right version of .NET.\nOn IIS check the .NET version on your app pool.Following on from my last comment about how the project was created - are you correctly including the assemblies, as below (taken from the default web.config file generated by the MVC3 project template in VS10):I had the same problem - my scenario was that I was referencing the new System.Web.Mvc.dll from a lib folder and I did not have "Copy Local" set to true.  The application was then reverting back to the version in the GAC which didn\'t have the correct namespaces (Html, Ajax etc) in it and was giving me the run time error.You need to update MVC.My solution was under Manage Nuget Packages for Solution... -- I had umpteen updates to do for quite a few packages.Let me back up a half step and say that I screwed myself over because I moved the solution and projects from one folder to another... so things were already out of whack compared to where the projects thought things out to be. Everything moved over just fine, but apparently Nuget becomes confused unless you use a different approach than I did.Back to the solution... I simply went to Manage Nuget Packages for Solution... >> Updates >> Microsoft and .NET and hit the Update All button.Everything was back to normal and happy.I downloaded an mvc 5 project and the offending issue pointing at  With this error message:-- >  in which I came to this webpage and tried a clean and a few things above etc...   What worked for me was just to This answer is rather late given the question date, but someone may find it useful.None of the above solutions worked for me in Visual Studio 2012 on a local project, Net Framework 4.5 MVC 4. For context, I was following a tutorial on creating a barebones Web Api on CodeProject (http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/615805/Creating-a-Clean-Minimal-Footprint-ASP-NET-WebAPI) when I ran into this problem.What did work for me was explicitly adding "System.Web.Mvc" to my application\'s references, even though the application already did reference "System.Web". Running the following command in the nuget package manager fixed it for me:I had the same issue, but none of the above worked for me. They did put me in to the right direction though.For example when I set the "Copy Local" to "true" for System.Web.Mvc reference, it automatically sets it back to False.I have multiple projects which  depend on the System.Web.Mvc reference in my solution, but only one caused this problem. \nIn VS 2012 this reference is labeled with the yellow attention triangle.Find this reference => remove it => re-add itThat fixed it for me.\nHope this helps Copy Local = True was solve for one of my projects. But in another project, I get the same error, tried to set Copy Local = true, but it not solve my problem. Changing the Target framework from 4.5.1 to 4.5 in Project Properties Helped with this.View and check the reference paths in your csproj.I had removed references to System.Web.Mvc (and others) and readded them to a custom path. C:\\Project\\OurWebReferencesHowever, after doing this, the reference path in the still csproj did not change. \nWASChanged to manuallyPaths are an example only.For me, the solution was to ensure all projects were building for the same CPU - in my case x86I did something really stupid (and maybe you did too). I was trying to call System.Web.Mvc.Html.Partial("<Partial Page>")Well ya\' see... System.Web.Mvc.Html is a namespace and not a class and I didn\'t read my error message so well, so I interpreted my error as the class Html does not exist in the namespace System.Web.Mvc and that\'s how I ended up here (stupid I know). All I needed to do was add a using statement @using System.Web.Mvc.Html to my page and then @Html.Partial worked as expected.if any of above not solves your problem just set properties of System.Web.Mvc.dll to copy local ture.it will solvesI had the same problem, but in my case was originated by other factor. I write this to help other people with the same problem.\nI have a solutions with multiple projects. two of them work with the System.Web.Mvc, Normally our reference was pointing to external packages where we controlled the used version. For some reason one of the project reference goes to GAC and point to the GAC dll (version 4.0.0.1) and the program got the error. \nTo correct it:Simple check if the references to System.Web.Mvc point to the same dll in the same directory path.I hope that help.I had the same problem, none of the solutions worked for me, Finally I removed the System.Web.MVC and added again Then everything was back to normal and my problem solved. I have deleted System.Web.dll from Bin frolder of my site.I had this problem, setting copy local on and off etc did not work.\nThe project was not using nuget so fixes around that were out of the question also.The fix for me was to install MVC 3 (which I did through the web platform installer). I suspect this will become more of a solution for people as the .net framework continues to advance and people don\'t have the older MVC stuff installed.It\'s likely that setting your DLL to CopyLocal/true or any of the other major fixes for this will fix your issue, but here is another edge-case that caught me for 20 minutes of wasted time.When you add your namespaces to your Views/Web.config, ensure they are cased correctly:
