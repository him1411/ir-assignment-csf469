I am trying to create a timestamp variable in a shell script to make the logging a little easier. I want to create the variable at the beginning of the script and have it print out the current time whenever I issue echo $timestamp. It proving to be more difficult then I thought. Here are some things I\'ve tried:timestamp="(date +"%T")" echo prints out (date +"%T")timestamp="$(date +"%T")" echo prints the time when the variable was initialized.Other things I\'ve tried are just slight variations that didn\'t work any better. Does anyone know how to accomplish what I\'m trying to do?In order to get the current timestamp and not the time of when a fixed variable is defined, the trick is to use a function and not a variable:If you don\'t like the format given by the %T specifier you can combine the other time conversion specifiers accepted by date.  For GNU date, you can find the complete list of these specifiers in the official documentation here: https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Time-conversion-specifiers.html#Time-conversion-specifiersIf you want to get unix timestamp, then you need to use:%T will give you just the time; same as %H:%M:%S (via http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-formatting-dates-for-display/)Use command substitution:You can useThis delivers in the format 2014-02-01 15:12:35-05:00The back-tick (`) characters will cause what is between them to be evaluated and have the result included in the line.  date --help has other options.srand without a value uses the current timestamp with most Awk implementations.
