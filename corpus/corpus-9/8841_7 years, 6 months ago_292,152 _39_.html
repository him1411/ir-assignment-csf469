I\'m using Python\'s max and min functions on lists for a minimax algorithm, and I need the index of the value returned by max() or min(). In other words, I need to know which move produced the max (at a first player\'s turn) or min (second player) value.I need to be able to return the actual index of the min or max value, not just the value.You can find the min/max index and value at the same time if you enumerate the items in the list, but perform min/max on the original values of the list. Like so:This way the list will only be traversed once for min (or max).Say that you have a list values = [3,6,1,5], and need the index of the smallest element, i.e. index_min = 2 in this case.Avoid the solution with itemgetter() presented in the other answers, and use insteadbecause it doesn\'t require to import operator nor to use enumerate, and it is always faster(benchmark below) than a solution using itemgetter().If you are dealing with numpy arrays or can afford numpy as a dependency, consider also usingThis will be faster than the first solution even if you apply it to a pure Python list if:as this benchmark points out:\nI have run the benchmark on my machine with python 2.7 for the two solutions above (blue: pure python, first solution) (red, numpy solution) and for the standard solution based on itemgetter() (black, reference solution).\nThe same benchmark with python 3.5 showed that the methods compare exactly the same of the python 2.7 case presented aboveIf you want to find the index of max within a list of numbers (which seems your case), then I suggest you use numpy:Possibly a simpler solution would be to turn the array of values into an array of value,index-pairs, and take the max/min of that. This would give the largest/smallest index that has the max/min (i.e. pairs are compared by first comparing the first element, and then comparing the second element if the first ones are the same). Note that it\'s not necessary to actually create the array, because min/max allow generators as input.Will give you first index of minimum.Use numpy module\'s function numpy.whereFor index of minimum value:    For index of maximum value:In fact, this function is much more powerful. You can pose all kinds of boolean operations\nFor index of value between 3 and 60:This is simply possible using the built-in enumerate() and max() function and the optional key argument of the max() function and a simple lambda expression:In the docs for max() it says that the key argument expects a function like in the list.sort() function. Also see the Sorting How To.It works the same for min(). Btw it returns the first max/min value.Why bother to add indices first and then reverse them? Enumerate() function is just a special case of zip() function usage. Let\'s use it in appropiate way:Just a minor addition to what has already been said.\nvalues.index(min(values)) seems to return the smallest index of min. The following gets the largest index:The last line can be left out if the side effect of reversing in place does not matter.To iterate through all occurrencesFor the sake of brevity. It is probably a better idea to cache min(values), values.count(min) outside the loop.As long as you know how to use lambda and the "key" argument, a simple solution is:I think the answer above solves your problem but I thought I\'d share a method that gives you the minimum and all the indices the minimum appears in.This passes the list twice but is still quite fast. It is however slightly slower than finding the  index of the first encounter of the minimum. So if you need just one of the minima, use Matt Anderson\'s solution, if you need them all, use this.A simple way for finding the indexes with minimal value in a list if you don\'t want to import additional modules:Then choose for example the first one:I was also interested in this and compared some of the suggested solutions using perfplot (a pet project of mine).Turns out that numpy\'s argmin is the fastest method for large enough lists, even with the implicit conversion from the input list to a numpy.array.Code for generating the plot:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#maxIf multiple items are maximal, the function returns the first one encountered. This is consistent with other sort-stability preserving tools such as sorted(iterable, key=keyfunc, reverse=True)[0]To get more than just the first use the sort method.Simple as that :
