I know that the >= operator means more than or equal to, but I\'ve seen => in some source code. What\'s the meaning of that operator?Here\'s the code:This is an arrow function. Arrow functions are a short syntax, introduced by ECMAscript 6, that can be used similarly to the way you would use function expressions. In other words, you can often use them in place of expressions like function (foo) {...}. But they have some important differences. For example, they do not bind their own values of this (see below for discussion).Arrow functions are part of the ECMAscript 6 specification, but not part of "normal" JavaScript in use in most browsers today. They are, however, partially supported in Node v. 4.0+ and in many browsers (see below).You can read more in the Mozilla documentation on arrow functions.From the Mozilla documentation:An arrow function expression (also known as fat arrow function) has a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and lexically binds the this value (does not bind its own this, arguments, super, or new.target). Arrow functions are always anonymous. These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions and they can not be used as constructors.One of the most handy features of an arrow function is buried in the text above:An arrow function... lexically binds the this value (does not bind its own this...)What this means in simpler terms is that the arrow function retains the this value from its context and does not have its own this. A traditional function does bind its own this value, requiring lots of gymnastics like self = this;, etc., to access or manipulate this from one function inside another function. For more info on this topic, see the explanation and examples in the Mozilla documentation.Example (also from the docs):You can use arrow functions in Node, but browser support is spotty.Browser support for this functionality has improved quite a bit, but it still is not widespread enough for most browser-based usages. As of January 25, 2017, it is supported in current versions of:Not supported in:You can find more (and more current) information at CanIUse.com (no affiliation).That\'s known as an Arrow Function, part of the ECMAScript 2015 spec...Shorter syntax than the previous:DEMOThe other awesome thing is lexical this... Usually, you\'d do something like:But that could be rewritten with the arrow like this:DEMOMDN\nMore on SyntaxFor more, here\'s a pretty good answer for when to use arrow functions.This would be the "arrow function expression" introduced in ECMAScript 6.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/arrow_functionsFor historical purposes (if the wiki page changes later), it is:An arrow function expression has a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and lexically binds the this value. Arrow functions are always anonymous.just to add another example of what a lambda can do without using map:As others have said, it\'s a new syntax to create functions.However, this kind of functions differ from normal ones:They bind the this value. As explained by the spec,An ArrowFunction does not define local bindings for arguments,\n  super, this, or new.target. Any reference to arguments,\n  super, this, or new.target within an ArrowFunction must\n  resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. Typically\n  this will be the Function Environment of an immediately enclosing\n  function.Even though an ArrowFunction may contain references to super, the\n  function object created in step 4 is not made into a method by\n  performing MakeMethod. An ArrowFunction that references super\n  is always contained within a non-ArrowFunction and the necessary\n  state to implement super is accessible via the scope that is\n  captured by the function object of the ArrowFunction.They are non-constructors.That means they have no [[Construct]] internal method, and thus can\'t be instantiated, e.g.I\'ve read, this is a symbol of Arrow Functions in ES6this using Arrow Function can be written asMDN DocsAlso known as Fat Arrow Functions. They\'re a clean and consise way to write function expressions, e.g. function() {}.Arrow Functions can remove the need of function, return and {} when defining functions. They are one-liners, similar to Lambda Expressions in Java or Python.If multiple statements need to be made within the same Arrow Function, you need to wrap, in this example, queue[0] in curley brackets {}. In this case the return statement cannot be omitted.You can omit {} from the above.When there is a single parameter, the brackets () around the parameter can be omitted.If we wanted to get the price of every fruit in a single array, in ES5 we could do:In ES6 with the new Arrow Functions, we can make this more concise:Additional information on Arrow Functions can be found here.Additional up-to-date information can be found on browser compatibility hereAs all of the other answers have already said, it\'s part of ES2015 arrow function syntax. More specifically, it\'s not an operator, it\'s a punctuator token that separates the parameters from the body: ArrowFunction : ArrowParameters => ConciseBody. E.g. (params) => { /* body */ }.
