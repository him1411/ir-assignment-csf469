What happens to the .box file after the following command is executed?I can\'t find the lucid32.box file on the file system after download has completed.As mentioned in the docs, boxes are stored at: On Mac/Linux System, the successfully downloaded boxes are located at:and unsuccessful boxes are located at:On Windows systems it is located under the Users folder:Hope this will help. ThanksTo change the Path, you can set a new Path to an Enviroment-Variable named: \nVAGRANT_HOMEThats maybe nice if you want to have those vagrant-Images on another HDD.More Information here in the Documentations: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/other/environmental-variables.htmlThe actual .box file is deleted by Vagrant once the download and box installation is complete.  As mentioned in other answers, whilst downloading, the .box file is stored as:where the file name is \'box\' followed by a 40 byte hexadecimal hash. A temporary file on my system for example, is:As far as I can tell, this file is never saved with a *.box extension, which explains why the searches above failed to locate it.  There are two ways to retrieve the actual box file:Download the .box file from vagrantcloud.comGet the .box directly from VagrantThis requires you to modify the ruby source to prevent Vagrant from deleting the box after successful download.ensure\n    # Make sure we delete the temporary file after we add it,\n    # unless we were interrupted, in which case we keep it around\n    # so we can resume the download later.\n    if !@download_interrupted\n      @logger.debug("Deleting temporary box: #{box_url}")\n      begin\n        box_url.delete if box_url\n      rescue Errno::ENOENT\n        # Not a big deal, the temp file may not actually exist\n      end\n    endFor me, this has been useful to retrieve the .box file so it can be hosted on local, fast infrastructure as opposed to downloading from HashiCorp\'s Atlas box catalog or another box provider.This really should be part of the default Vagrant functionality as it has a very definitive use case.@Luke Peterson: There\'s a simpler way to get .box file.Just go to https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search, search for the box you\'d like to download. Notice the URL of the box, e.g:https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64/versions/20150530.0.1Then you can download this box using URL like this:https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64/versions/20150530.0.1/providers/virtualbox.boxI tried and successfully download all the boxes I need. Hope that help.On Windows, the location can be found here. I didn\'t find any documentation on the internet for this, and this wasn\'t immediately obvious to me:C:\\Users\\\\{username}\\\\.vagrant.d\\boxes
