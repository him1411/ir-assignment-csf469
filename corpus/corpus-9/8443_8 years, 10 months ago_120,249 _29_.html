I want to have two items on the same line using \'float: left\' for the item on the left.I have no problems achieving this alone. The problem is, I want the two items to stay on the same line even when you resize the browser very small. You know... like how it was with tables.The goal is to keep the item on the right from wrapping no matter what.So how to I tell the browser using css that I would rather stretch the containing div than wrap it so the the float: right; div is below the float: left; div?example:\nwhat I want:Wrap your floating <div>s in a container <div> that uses this cross-browser min-width hack:You may also need to set "overflow" but probably not.This works because:Another option is, instead of floating, to set the white-space property nowrap to a parent div:and reset the white-space and use an inline-block display so the divs stay on the same line but you can still give it a width.Here is a JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/9g8ud31o/Wrap your floaters in a div with a min-width greater than the combined width+margin of the floaters.No hacks or HTML tables needed.Solution 1:\ndisplay:table-cell (not widely supported)\nSolution 2:\ntables(I hate hacks.)Another option: Do not float your right column; just give it a left margin to move it beyond the float. You\'ll need a hack or two to fix IE6, but that\'s the basic idea.Are you sure that floated block-level elements are the best solution to this problem? Often with CSS difficulties in my experience it turns out that the reason I can\'t see a way of doing the thing I want is that I have got caught in a tunnel-vision with regard to my markup ( thinking "how can I make these elements do this?" ) rather than going back and looking at what exactly it is I need to achieve and maybe reworking my html slightly to facilitate that.i\'d recommend using tables for this problem. i\'m having a similar issue and as long as the table is just used to display some data and not for the main page layout it is fine.Add this line to your floated element selectorIt will prevent padding and borders to be added to width, so element always stay in row, even if you have eg. three elements with width of 33.33333%When user reduces window size horizontally and this causes floats to stack vertically, remove the floats and on the second div (that was a float) use margin-top: -123px (your value) and margin-left: 444px (your value) to position the divs as they appeared with floats.\nWhen done this way, when the window narrows, the right-side div stays in place and disappears when page is too narrow to include it.  ... which (to me) is better than having the right-side div "jump" down below the left-side div when the browser window is narrowed by the user.The way I got around this was to use some jQuery.  The reason I did it this way was because A and B were percent widths.HTML:CSS:jQuery:
