I\'ve noticed that the Linux kernel code uses bool, but I thought that bool was a C++ type. Is bool a standard C extension (e.g., ISO C90) or a GCC extension?bool exists in the current C - C99, but not in C89/90.In C99 the native type is actually called _Bool, while bool is a standard library macro defined in stdbool.h (which expectedly resolves to _Bool). Objects of type _Bool hold either 0 or 1, while true and false are also macros from stdbool.h.C99 added a builtin _Bool data type (see Wikipedia for details), and if you #include <stdbool.h>, it provides bool as a macro to _Bool.You asked about the Linux kernel in particular.  It assumes the presence of _Bool and provides a bool typedef itself in include/linux/types.h.No, there is no bool in ISO C90.Here\'s a list of keywords in standard C (not C99):Here\'s an article discussing some other differences with C as used in the kernel and the standard: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-gcc-hacks/index.htmlC99 has it in stdbool.h, but in C90 it must be defined as a typedef or enum:Alternatively:_Bool is a keyword in C99: it specifies a type, just like int or double.6.5.22   An object declared as type _Bool\n  is large enough to store the values 0\n  and 1.C99 defines bool, true and false in stdbool.h.stdbool.h was introduced in c99No such thing, probably just a macro for int
