At CDNJS jquery.slim package is placed. It has a smaller size. What are the major differences from an original? A quick look at the code didn\'t bring the answer, and at the jquery.com I\'ve not found any reference about slim package.So, what are the differences between jquery.js and jquery.slim.js ?Looking at the code I found the following differences between jquery.js and jquery.slim.js:In the jquery.slim.js, the following function of code are removed:The short answer taken from the announcement of jQuery 3.0 Final Release :Along with the regular version of jQuery that includes the ajax and effects modules, we\xe2\x80\x99re releasing a \xe2\x80\x9cslim\xe2\x80\x9d version that excludes these modules. All in all, it excludes ajax, effects, and currently deprecated code.The file size (gzipped) is about 6k smaller, 23.6k vs 30k.At this time, the most authoritative answer appears to be in this issue, which states "it is a custom build of jQuery that excludes effects, ajax, and deprecated code." Details will be announced with jQuery 3.0. I suspect that the rationale for excluding these components of the jQuery library is in recognition of the increasingly common scenario of jQuery being used in conjunction with another JS framework like Angular or React. In these cases, the usage of jQuery is primarily for DOM traversal and manipulation, so leaving out those components that are either obsolete or are provided by the framework gains about a 20% reduction in file size.I could see $.ajax is removed from jQuery slim 3.2.1Below is the comment from the slim version with the features removed
