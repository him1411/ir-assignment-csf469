I would like to place two plots side by side using the ggplot2 package, i.e. do the equivalent of par(mfrow=c(1,2)).For example, I would like to have the following two plots show side-by-side with the same scale.Do I need to put them in the same data.frame?The function grid.arrange() in the gridExtra package will combine multiple plots; this is how you put two side by side. This is useful when the two plots are not based on the same data, for example if you want to plot different variables without using reshape(). This will plot the output as a side effect. To print the side effect to a file, specify a device driver (such as pdf, png, etc), e.g.or, use arrangeGrob() in combination with ggsave(),This is the equivalent of making two distinct plots using par(mfrow = c(1,2)). This not only saves time arranging data, it is necessary when you want two dissimilar plots.Facets are helpful for making similar plots for different groups. This is pointed out below in many answers below, but I want to highlight this approach with examples equivalent to the above plots. the plot_grid function in the cowplot is worth checking out as an alternative to grid.arrange. See the answer by @claus-wilke below and this vignette for an equivalent approach; but the function allows finer controls on plot location and size, based on this vignette. I\'ve never liked the solutions based on grid.arrange, because they make it difficult to label the plots with letters (A, B, etc.), as most journals require. It\'s also difficult to align plots with grid.arrange.I wrote the cowplot package to solve these issues, specifically the function plot_grid(): For a more in-depth description of plot_grid(), see this vignette.You can use the following multiplot function from  Winston Chang\'s R cookbookYes, methinks you need to arrange your data appropriately. One way would be this:I am sure there are better tricks in plyr or reshape -- I am still not really up to speed \non all these powerful packages by Hadley.Using the reshape package you can do something like this.Stephen Turner posted the arrange() function on Getting Genetics Done blog (see post for application instructions); however grid.arrange() is recommended, see comment below)The above solutions may not be efficient if you want to plot multiple ggplot plots using a loop (e.g. as asked here: Creating multiple plots in ggplot with different Y-axis values using a loop), which is a desired step in analyzing the unknown (or large) data-sets (e.g., when you  want to plot Counts of all variables in a data-set).The code below shows how to do that using the mentioned above \'multiplot()\', the source of which is here: http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Multiple_graphs_on_one_page_(ggplot2): Now run the function - to get Counts for all variables printed using ggplot on one pageOne things to note is that:\n using  aes(get(strX)), which you would normally use in loops when working with ggplot , in the above code instead of aes_string(strX) will NOT draw the desired plots. Instead, it will plot the last plot many times. I have not figured out why - it may have to do the aes and aes_string are called in ggplot.Otherwise, hope you\'ll find the function useful.Using dplyrand tidyr:The cowplot package gives you a nice way to do this, in a manner that suits publication.\nx <- rnorm(100)\neps <- rnorm(100,0,.2)\nA = qplot(x,3*x+eps, geom = c("point", "smooth"))+theme_gray()\nB = qplot(x,2*x+eps, geom = c("point", "smooth"))+theme_gray()\ncowplot::plot_grid(A, B, labels = c("A", "B"), align = "v")\n
