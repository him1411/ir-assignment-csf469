I\'d like to call a function in python using a dictionary.Here is some code:This prints {\'param\': \'test\'} but I\'d like it to just print test.I\'d like it to work similarly for more parameters:Is this possible?Figured it out for myself in the end. It is simple, I was just missing the ** operator to unpack the dictionarySo my example becomes:In python, this is called "unpacking", and you can find a bit about it in the tutorial. The documentation of it sucks, I agree, especially because of how fantasically useful it is.A few extra details that might be helpful to know (questions I had after reading this and went and tested):Examples of each:Number 1: The function can have parameters that are not included in the dictionaryNumber 2: You can not override a parameter that is already in the dictionaryNumber 3: The dictionary can not have parameters that aren\'t in the function.Here ya go - works just any other iterable:
