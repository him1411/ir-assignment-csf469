I would like to take a stringand process it into an object such thatandfound here: https://gist.github.com/jlong/2428561The modern way:Returns an object with properties hostname and pathname, along with a few others.The first argument is a relative or absolute URL; if it\'s relative, then you need to specify the second argument (the base URL). For example, for a URL relative to the current page:In addition to browsers, this API is also available in Node.js since v7, through require(\'url\').URL.Here\'s a simple function using a regexp that imitates the a tag behavior.ProsCons--EDIT:Here\'s a breakdown of the regular expressionfreddiefujiwara\'s answer is pretty good but I also needed to support relative URLs within Internet Explorer.  I came up with the following solution:Now use it to get the needed properties:JSFiddle example: http://jsfiddle.net/6AEAB/js-uri (available on Google Code) takes a string URL and resolves a URI object from it:You don\'t need to create anything like a new URI, or createElement.returns the object you would want:What about simple regular expression?Here is a version that I copied from https://gist.github.com/1847816, but rewritten so it\'s easier to read and debug. The purpose of copying the of the anchor data to another variable named "result" is because the anchor data is pretty long, and so copying a limited number of values to the result will help simplify the result.For those looking for a modern solution that works in IE, Firefox, AND Chrome:None of these solutions that use a hyperlink element will work the same in chrome. If you pass an invalid (or blank) url to chrome, it will always return the host where the script is called from. So in IE you will get blank, whereas in Chrome you will get localhost (or whatever). If you are trying to look at the referrer, this is deceitful. You will want to make sure that the host you get back was in the original url to deal with this:You can also use parse_url() function from php.js project.Code:Result:Cross-browser URL parsing, works around the relative path problem for IE 6, 7, 8 and 9:Usage (demo JSFiddle here):Result:The AngularJS way - fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/PT5BG/4/Simple and robust solution using the module pattern. This includes a fix for IE where the pathname does not always have a leading forward-slash (/).I have created a Gist along with a JSFiddle which offers a more dynamic parser. I recommend you check it out and provide feedback.today I meet this problem and I found: URL - MDN Web APIsThis return:Hoping my first contribution helps you !Stop reinventing the wheel. Use https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/Just use url.js library (for web and node.js).https://github.com/websanova/js-urlUse https://www.npmjs.com/package/uri-parse-lib for thisWhy do not use it?It works with both absolute and relative urls
