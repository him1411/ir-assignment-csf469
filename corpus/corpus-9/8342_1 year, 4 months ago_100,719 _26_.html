I get the following  error while upgrading a firebase project from old domain to new google firebase domain.Failed to resolve: com.google.firebase:firebase-core:9.0.0I followed the steps mentioned on the Firebase documentation, in the section Add Firebase to your Android Project, topic Available libraries.What are my options to resolve this error?As of version 11.2.0 Firebase and Google Play services dependencies are available via Google\'s Maven Repo.  You no longer need to use the Android SDK manager to import these dependencies.In your root build.gradle file add the repo:If you are using gradle 4.0 or higher you can replace maven { url "https://maven.google.com" } with just google().The 9.0.0 version of Firebase was built using Google Play services 9.0 and is now available under the new packaging com.google.firebase:*See Release Notes for Google Play services 9.0\nhttps://developers.google.com/android/guides/releases#may_2016_-_v90New versions of packages Google Play Services (rev 30) and Google Repository (rev 26) were just released in the SDK manager so it\'s likely you just need to update.As of April 2017, the latest versions of Google Play Services and Repository are listed below.Go to Android SDK Manager and install the latest version of below two librariesError:(30, 13) Failed to resolve: com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:9.6.1 If you ever get this error and you are using Android studio 2.2 that comes with firebase component integrated in it which has libraries version 9.6.0 by default and you are adding the latest dependencies like 9.6.1  . You might need to downgrade com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:9.6.1 to com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:9.6.0Faced myself and seen several times in comments for similar questions - that even after installing "latest" Google Play Services and Google Repository still having the same issue.The thing is that they may be latest for your current revision of Android SDK Tools, but not that latest your app build requires.In such case make sure to install latest version of Android SDK Tools first, and probably Android SDK Platform-tools (both under Tools branch). Also please note you may need to go through this several times if you haven\'t updated for a long time (i.e. install latest Android SDK Tools and Android SDK Platform-tools, then restart Android SDK Manager, then repeat), since the updates seem to be going through some critical mandatory milestones and you cannot install the very latest if you currently have the revision which is pretty "old".Following are the prerequisites if you want to add firebase to your project. I could only find out all this after hours of struggle.Source: Adding Firebase to your Android AppNeed to UpdateAndroid SDK : SDK Tools -> Support Repository -> Google RepositoryAfter updating the Android SDK need to sync gradle build in Android studio.
