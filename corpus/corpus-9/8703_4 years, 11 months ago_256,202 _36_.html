I am making a small vocabulary remembering program where words would would be flashed at me randomly for meanings. I want to use standard C++ library as Bjarne Stroustroup tells us, but I have encountered a seemingly strange problem right out of the gate. I want to change a long integer into std::string so as to be able to store it in a file. I have employed to_string() for the same. The problem is, when I compile it with g++ (version 4.7.0 as mentioned in its --\xe2\x80\x8dversion flag), it says:My program that gives this error is:But, I know it can\'t be because msdn library clearly says it exists and an earlier question on Stack Overflow (for g++ version 4.5) says that it can be turned on with the -std=c++0x flag. What am I doing wrong?This is a known bug under MinGW. Relevant Bugzilla. In the comments section you can get a patch to make it work with MinGW.This issue has been fixed in MinGW-w64 distros higher than GCC 4.8.0 provided by the MinGW-w64 project. Despite the name, the project provides toolchains for 32-bit along with 64-bit. The Nuwen MinGW distro also solves this issue.do not forget to include #include <sstream>As suggested this may be an issue with your compiler version.Try using the following code to convert a long to std::string:Use this function...Here\'s a new-ish answer to an old thread. A new one did come up but was quickly quashed, \nCygwin: g++ 5.2: \xe2\x80\x98to_string\xe2\x80\x99 is not a member of \xe2\x80\x98std\xe2\x80\x99. Too bad, maybe we would have gotten an updated answer. According to @Alex, Cygwin g++ 5.2 is still not working as of November 3, 2015. On January 16, 2015 Corinna Vinschen, a Cygwin maintainer at Red Hat said the problem was a shortcoming of newlib. It doesn\'t support most long double functions and is therefore not C99 aware. Red Hat is, ... still hoping to get the "long double" functionality into newlib at\n  one point.On October 25, 2015 Corrine also said, It would still be nice if somebody with a bit of math knowledge would\n  contribute the missing long double functions to newlib.So there we have it. Maybe one of us who has the knowledge, and the time, can contribute and be the hero.Newlib is here.Change default C++ standard From (COMPILE FILE FAILED) error: \'to_string\' is not a member of \'std\'-std=c++98To (COMPILE FILE SUCCESSFUL)-std=c++11 or -std=c++14Tested on Cygwin G++(GCC) 5.4.0The fact is that libstdc++ actually supported std::to_string in *-w64-mingw32 targets since 4.8.0. However, this does not include support for MinGW.org, Cygwin and variants (e.g. *-pc-msys from MSYS2). See also https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2015-01/msg00245.html.I have implemented a workaround before the bug resolved for MinGW-w64. Being different to code in other answers, this is a mimic to libstdc++ (as possible). It does not require string stream construction but depends on libstdc++ extensions. Even now I am using mingw-w64 targets on Windows, it still works well for multiple other targets (as long as long double functions not being used).For anyone wondering why this happens on Android, it\'s probably because you\'re using a wrong c++ standard library. Try changing the c++ library in your build.gradle from gnustl_static to c++_static and the c++ standard in your CMakeLists.txt from -std=gnu++11 to -std=c++11If we use a template-light-solution (as shown above) like the following:Unfortunately, we will have problems in some cases. For example, for static const members:hppcppAnd linking:Here is one way to solve the problem (add to the type size_t):HTH.This happened to me as well, I just wrote up a quick function rather than worrying about updating my compiler.
