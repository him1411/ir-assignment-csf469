In Python, what is the difference between expressions and statements?Expressions only contain identifiers, literals and operators, where operators include arithmetic and boolean operators, the function call operator () the subscription operator [] and similar, and can be reduced to some kind of "value", which can be any Python object.  Examples:Statements (see 1, 2), on the other hand, are everything that can make up a line (or several lines) of Python code.  Note that expressions are statements as well.  Examples:Expression -- from my dictionary: expression: Mathematics a collection\n  of symbols that jointly express a\n  quantity : the expression for the\n  circumference of a circle is 2\xcf\x80r.In gross general terms: Expressions produce at least one value.In Python, expressions are covered extensively in the Python Language Reference In general, expressions in Python are composed of a syntactically legal combination of Atoms, Primaries and Operators. Python expressions from WikipediaExamples of expressions: Literals and syntactically correct combinations with Operators and built-in functions or the call of a user-written functions:Statement from Wikipedia:In computer programming a statement\n  can be thought of as the smallest\n  standalone element of an imperative\n  programming language. A program is\n  formed by a sequence of one or more\n  statements. A statement will have\n  internal components (e.g.,\n  expressions).Python statements from WikipediaIn gross general terms: Statements Do Something and are often composed of expressions (or other statements)The Python Language Reference covers Simple Statements and Compound Statements extensively. The distinction of "Statements do something" and "expressions produce a value" distinction can become blurry however: Though this isn\'t related to Python:An expression evaluates to a value.\nA statement does something.Statements represent an action or command e.g print statements, assignment statements. Expression is a combination of variables, operations and values that yields a result value.Lastly, expression statementsAn expression is something that can be reduced to a value, for example "1+3" or "foo = 1+3".It\'s easy to check:If it doesn\'t work, it\'s a statement, if it does, it\'s an expression.Another statement could be:as it cannot be reduced to a value.Python calls expressions "expression statements", so the question is perhaps not fully formed.A statement consists of pretty much anything you can do in Python: calculating a value, assigning a value, deleting a variable, printing a value, returning from a function, raising an exception, etc. The full list is here: http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html# An expression statement is limited to calling functions (e.g., \nmath.cos(theta)"), operators ( e.g., "2+3"), etc.  to produce a value. A statement contains a keyword.An expression does not contain a keyword.print "hello" is statement, because print is a keyword."hello" is an expression, but list compression is against this.The following is an expression statement, and it is true without list comprehension:I think an expression contains operators + operands and the object that holds the result of the operation... e.g.but a statement is simply a line of a code (it may be an expression) or block of code... e.g.}Expressions:2.0 + 3 is an expression which evaluates to 5.0 and has a type float associated with it.StatementsStatements are composed of expression(s). It can span multiple lines.
