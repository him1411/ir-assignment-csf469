Is there any difference between HTML.ActionLink vs Url.Action or they are just two ways of doing the same thing?When should I prefer one over the other?Yes, there is a difference. Html.ActionLink generates an <a href=".."></a> tag whereas Url.Action returns only an url. For example:generates:and Url.Action("someaction", "somecontroller", new { id = "123" }) generates:There is also Html.Action which executes a child controller action.Html.ActionLink generates an <a href=".."></a> tag automatically.Url.Action generates only an url.For example:generates:and generates:Best plus point which I like is using Url.Action(...) You are creating anchor tag by your own where you can set your own linked text easily even with some other html tag.In the above example you can see that If I specifically need a button to do some action, I have to do it with @Url.Action whereas if I just want a link I will use @Html.ActionLink.\nThe point is when you have to use some element(HTML) with action url is used. You can easily present Html.ActionLink as a button by using the appropriate CSS style. \nFor example:I used the code below to create a Button and it worked for me.
