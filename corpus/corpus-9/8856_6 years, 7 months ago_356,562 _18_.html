Configuring servers is not my strong suit by any means.\nI\'m trying to move a development project to Windows 7.\nOne of the things that I need to run the application is to select ASP.NET v4.0 as the application pool within IIS.I went through the directions in the following link to make sure that the proper Application Development Options were selected:http://www.gotknowhow.com/articles/how-to-install-iis7-and-enable-aspnetFrom within the IIS Manager, I select Application Pools and only see\n- Classic .NET AppPool\n- DefaultAppPoolI need to also be able to select from\n- ASP.NET v4.0\n- ASP.NET v4.0 ClassicHow can I add these to the list of available application pools?Chances are you need to install .NET 4 (Which will also create a new AppPool for you)First make sure you have IIS installed then perform the following steps:(You can repeat steps 7-on for every site you want to apply .NET 4 on as well).Additional References:In the top level of the IIS Manager (above Sites), you should see the Application Pools tree node. Right click on "Application Pools", choose "Add Application Pool".Give it a name, choose .NET Framework 4.0 and either Integrated or Classic mode.When you add or edit a web site, your new application pools will now show up in the list.Open a windows command line. Switch directories to C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.Net\\Framework\\v4.0.xxxx where the x\'s are the build number. Type aspnet_regiis -ir and hit enter. This should register .Net v4.0 and create the application pools by default. If it doesn\'t, you will need to create them manually by right-clicking the Application Pools folder in IIS and choosing Add Application Pool.Edit: As a reference, please refer to the section of the linked document referring to the -i argument.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k6h9cz8h.aspxI just encountered this and whilst we already had .NET 4.0 installed on the server it turns out we only had the "Client Profile" version and not the "Full" version. Installing the latter fixed the problem.Installing framework 4.0 redistributable is also enough to create application pool. You can download it from here.
