I want to write a module where on a click of a button the camera opens and I can click and capture an image.  If I don\'t like the image I can delete it and click one more image and then select the image and it should return back and display that image in the activity.Here\'s an example activity that will launch the camera app and then retrieve the image and display it.Note that the camera app itself gives you the ability to review/retake the image, and once an image is accepted, the activity displays it.Here is the layout that the above activity uses.  It is simply a LinearLayout containing a Button with id button1 and an ImageView with id imageview1: And one final detail, be sure to add:and if camera is optional to your app functionality. make sure to set require to false in the permission. like thisto your manifest.xml.It took me some hours to get this working. The code it\'s almost a copy-paste from developer.android.com, with a minor difference.Request this permission on the AndroidManifest.xml:On your Activity, start by defining this:Then fire this Intent in an onClick:Add the following support method:Then receive the result:What made it work is the MediaStore.Images.Media.getBitmap(this.getContentResolver(), Uri.parse(mCurrentPhotoPath)), which is different from the code from developer.android.com. The original code gave me a FileNotFoundException.Capture photo + Choose from Gallery:You need to read up about the Camera.  (I think to do what you want, you\'d have to save the current image to your app, do the select/delete there, and then recall the camera to try again, rather than doing the retry directly inside the camera.)Here is code I have used for Capturing and Saving Camera Image then display it to imageview. You can use according to your need.You have to save Camera image to specific location then fetch from that location then convert it to byte-array.Here is method for opening capturing camera image activity.then your onActivityResult() method should be like this.Here is getBitmap() method used in onActivityResult(). I have done all performance improvement that can be possible while getting camera capture image bitmap.Hope it helps!In Activity:in layout.xml:in manifest.xml:\n      Capture photo from camera + pick image from gallery and set it into the background of layout or imageview. Here is sample code.I know it\'s a quite old thread, but all these solutions are not completed and don\'t work on some devices when user rotates camera because data in onActivityResult is null. So here is solution which I have tested on lots of devices and haven\'t faced any problem so far.First declare your Uri variable in your activity:Then create your temporary folder for storing captured image and make intent for capturing image by camera:And now here comes one of the most important things, you have to save your uriFilePath in onSaveInstanceState, because if you didn\'t do that and user rotated his device while using camera, your uri would be null.After that you should always recover your uri in your onCreate method:And here comes last part to get your Uri in onActivityResult:P.S. Don\'t forget to add permissions for Camera and Ext. storage writing to your Manifest.You can use custom camera with thumbnail image.\nYou can look my project.Here is the complete code:Remember to add permissions for the camera too.
