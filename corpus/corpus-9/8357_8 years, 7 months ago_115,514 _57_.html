There is no "Done" button on the number pad. When a user finishes entering numeric information in a text field, how can I make the number pad disappear?I could get a "Done" button by using the default keyboard, but then users would have to switch to the numeric keys in order to input numbers. Is there a way to show a "Done" button on the number pad?Another solution. Perfect if there are other non-number pad text fields on the screen.Here is an adaptation for Luda\'s answer for Swift:In the declaration of your UIViewController subclass putin ViewDidLoad put:and the add the functions hoopla and hoopla (feel free to choose other names, just change the selector names in ViewDidLoad accordinglyThe trick I\'ve seen used is to make a custom transparent button the size of the whole view and then in its click method, have the text field resign first responder. So the user can click anywhere outside of the field to dismiss the keypad.The solution in UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad and missing return key works great but only if there are no other non-number pad text fields on the screen.I took that code and turned it into an UIViewController that you can simply subclass to make number pads work. You will need to get the icons from the above link.NumberPadViewController.h:and NumberPadViewController.m:Enjoy.Below is an overhaul of Luda\'s answer with the following changes:the accessory view is automatically sized to the width of the application framethe deprecated constant UIBarButtonItemStyleBordered is avoidedthe "Done" button is instantiated as a UIBarButtonSystemItemDoneCurrently the "Done" button is centered in the accessory view. You can position it at left or right by deleting the space on the pertinent side.I have omitted a "Cancel" button because the default keyboard doesn\'t have one either. If you do want a "Cancel" button, I suggest that you instantiate it as a UIBarButtonSystemItemCancel and that you make sure you\'re not discarding the original value in your text field. The "Cancel" behavior implemented in Luda\'s answer, which overwrites the value with a blank string, may not be what you want.For more information about building accessory views, see the Apple documentation on custom views for data input. You will probably want to consult the reference pages on UIToolbar and UIBarButtonItem as well.Here is the most recent code.  Simply include \n    #import "UIViewController+NumPadReturn.h" in your viewController.   Here is the .hAnd the .mMuch easier solutionThis forum post describes how to customize the UIKeyboard to add your custom view onto the keyboard.I describe one solution for iOS 4.2+ here but the dismiss button fades in after the keyboard appears.  It\'s not terrible, but not ideal either.The solution described in the question linked above includes a more elegant illusion to dismiss the button, where I fade and vertically displace the button to provide the appearance that the keypad and the button are dismissing together.The simplest way is:Create custom transparent button and place it in left down corner, which will have same CGSize as empty space in UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad. Toggle (show / hide) this button on textField becomeFirstResponder, on button click respectively.Here\'s the simplest solution I have come across. I have learnt this from Beginning iOS 5 Development book.Assuming the number field is called numberField.In ViewController, add the following method:In ViewController.m, add the following code:Go back to nib file.Now when you click anywhere on background of View, you should be able to dismiss the keyboard.Hope this helps you solve your problem. :-)I modified Bryan\'s solution to be a little more robust, so that it would play nicely with other types of keyboards that could appear in the same view.  It\'s described here:Create a DONE button on the iOS numpad UIKeyboardI\'d try to explain it here, but most of it is code to look at that wouldn\'t easily fit hereIf you know in advance the number of numbers to be entered (e.g. a 4-digit PIN) you could auto-dismiss after 4 key presses, as per my answer to this similar question:dismissing Number PadNo need for an additional done button in this case.We can also make the "user touched somewhere else" solution even simpler if we just tell our view controller\'s view to end editing:... assuming that "touching elsewhere dismisses the keyboard" is desired behavior for any other editable fields on the view as well.For Swift 2.2 I use thisIf you have multiple numeric fields, I suggest subclassing UITextField to create a NumericTextField that always displays a numeric keyboard with a done button. Then, simply associate your numeric fields with this class in the Interface Builder and you won\'t need any additional code in any of your View Controllers. The following is Swift 3.0 class that I\'m using in Xcode 8.0. I found @user1258240\'s answer to be pretty concise given this is not as simple as setting a returnKeyType property.Just wanted to contribute my own "re-usable" approach to this:All those implementation about finding the keyboard view and adding the done button at the 3rd row (that is why button.y = 163 b/c keyboard\'s height is 216) are fragile because iOS keeps change the view hierarchy. For example none of above codes work for iOS9.I think it is more safe to just find the topmost view, by [[[UIApplication sharedApplication] windows] lastObject], and just add the button at bottom left corner of it, doneButton.frame = CGRectMake(0, SCREEN_HEIGHT-53, 106, 53);// portrait modeSwift 2.2 / I used Dx_\'s answer. However, I wanted this functionality on all keyboards. So in my base class I put the code:Then just call addDoneButtonForTextFields on self.view.subviews in viewDidLoad (or willDisplayCell if using a table view) to add the Done button to all keyboards.A Swift 3 solution using an extension. Ideal if you have several numeric UITextField objects in your app as it gives the flexibility to decide, for each UITextField, whether to perform a custom action when Done or Cancel is tapped.Example of usage using the default actions:Example of usage using a custom Done action:SWIFT 3.0 A different flavor, using parts of some previous answers.
