A simple question: is it possible to customize the tab-to-space conversion factor when using VSCode? For instance, right now in HTML it appears to produce 2 spaces per press of TAB, but in Typescript it produces 4.By default, VSCode will try to guess your indentation options depending on the file you open.You can turn off indentation guessing via "editor.detectIndentation": falseYou can customize this easily via these 3 settings in File > Preferences > User Settings:I\'m running version 1.21 but I think this may apply to earlier versions as well.Take a look at the bottom right-hand side of the screen. You should see something that says Spaces or Tab-Size.Mine shows spaces, --> \nBy default, VSCode auto-detects the indentation of the current open file. If you want to switch this feature off and make all indentation, for example, 2 spaces, you\'d do the following in your User Settings or Workspace settings.We can control tab size by file type with EditorConfig and its VS Code extension. We then can make Alt+Shift+F specific to each file type.ext install EditorConfig.editorconfigEditorConfig overrides whatever settings.json configures for the editor. There is no need to change editor.detectIndentation. Well, the new version of vscode allows you to specify differently file type for the tabSize, here is the example of my settings.json with default 4 spaces and js/json 2 spaces:PS: Well, if you do not know how to open this file: File / Preferences / SettingsI just wanted to chime in to say you want to make sure your editorconfig is not conflicting with your user or workspace settings configs, as I just had a bit of annoyance thinking the settings files settings were not being applied when it was my editor config undoing those changes.That is lonefy.vscode-js-css-html-formatter to blame, disable it, and install HookyQR.beautifyNow on save your tabs wouldnt be converted User3550138 is correct lonefy.vscode-js-css-html-formatter overrides all the settings mentioned in other answers, however you don\'t have to disable or uninstall it as it can be configured. Full instructions can be found by opening the extensions sidebar and clicking on this extension and it will display configuration instructions in the editor workspace. At least it does for me on VS Code version 1.14.1.
