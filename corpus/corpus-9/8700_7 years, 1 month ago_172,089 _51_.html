Is there a way to add all files no matter what you do to them whether it be deleted, untracked, etc? like for a commit. I just don\'t want to have to git add or git rm all my files every time I commit, especially when I\'m working on a large product.Try:Warning: Starting with git 2.0 (mid 2013), this will always stage files on the whole working tree.\nIf you want to stage files under the current path of your working tree, you need to use:Also see: Difference of git add -A and git add .TryThe "u" option stands for update.  This will update the repo and actually delete files from the repo that you have deleted in your local copy.to stage a delete to just one file.  Once pushed, the file will no longer be in the repo.Alternatively,git add -A .is equivalent toNote the extra \'.\' on git add -A and git add -uWarning: Starting with git 2.0 (mid 2013), this will always stage files on the whole working tree.\nIf you want to stage files under the current path of your working tree, you need to use:Also see: Difference of git add -A and git add .You want git add -A:git add -A stages All;git add . stages new and modified, without deleted;git add -u stages modified and deleted, without new.git add --all or git add -A or git add -A .

It does the work.:)This is my alternative (in any bash):To resetI authored the G2 project, a friendly environment for the command line git lover.\n   Please get the project from github - G2 https://github.com/orefalo/g2It has a bunch of handy commands, one of them being exactly what your are looking for: freezefreeze - Freeze all files in the repository (additions, deletions, modifications) to the staging area, thus staging that content for inclusion in the next commit. Also accept a specific path as parameterFor newer version of Git.I tried git add -A and this prompted,warning: The behavior of \'git add --all (or -A)\' with no path argument\n  from a subdirectory of the tree will change in Git 2.0 and should not\n  be used anymore. To add content for the whole tree, run:git add --all :/   (or git add -A :/)To restrict the command to the current directory, run:git add --all .   (or git add -A .)With the current Git version, the command is restricted to the current\n  directory.Then I tried below which worked.I use the following line to add for staging all the modified and newly created files, excluding the ones listed in .gitignore:(the syntax $() is for the bash shell).  I guess that the command line option -mod should add also the deleted files...  Or, if you have file names with embedded blanks, the following one-liner should do the trick:From Git documentation starting from version 2.0:To add content for the whole tree, run:or To restrict the command to the current directory, run:or This is what I use for staging all changed files under a folder:Thanks!
