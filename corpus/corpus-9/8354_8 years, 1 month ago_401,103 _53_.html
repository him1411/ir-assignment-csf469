What\'s the correct way to get a JFrame to close, the same as if the user had hit the X close button, or pressed Alt+F4 (on Windows)?I have my default close operation set the way I want, via:It does exactly what I want with the aforementioned controls.  This question isn\'t about that.What I really want to do is cause the GUI to behave in the same way as a press of X close button would cause it to behave.Suppose I were to extend WindowAdaptor and then add an instance of my adaptor as a listener via addWindowListener().  I would like to see the same sequence of calls through windowDeactivated(), windowClosing(), and windowClosed() as would occur with the X close button.  Not so much tearing up the window as telling it to tear itself up, so to speak.If you want the GUI to behave as if you clicked the X close button then you need to dispatch a window closing event to the Window. The ExitAction from Closing An Application allows you to add this functionality to a menu item or any component that uses Actions easily.Not too tricky.If by Alt-F4 or X you mean "Exit the Application Immediately Without Regard for What Other Windows or Threads are Running", then System.exit(...) will do exactly what you want in a very abrupt, brute-force, and possibly problematic fashion.If by Alt-F4 or X you mean hide the window, then frame.setVisible(false) is how you "close" the window. The window will continue to consume resources/memory but can be made visible again very quickly.If by Alt-F4 or X you mean hide the window and dispose of any resources it is consuming, then frame.dispose() is how you "close" the window. If the frame was the last visible window and there are no other non-daemon threads running, the program will exit. If you show the window again, it will have to reinitialize all of the native resources again (graphics buffer, window handles, etc).dispose() might be closest to the behavior that you really want. If your app has multiple windows open, do you want Alt-F4 or X to quit the app or just close the active window?The Java Swing Tutorial on Window Listeners may help clarify things for you.If you have done this to make sure the user can\'t close the window:Then you should change your pullThePlug() method to beI found this to be the only way that plays nice with the WindowListener and JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE.Not only to close the JFrame but also to trigger WindowListener events, try this:Exiting from Java running process is very easy, basically you need to do just two simple things: Note: you must call System.exit(...) otherwise your program is error involved.This is strongly related to your programming skills. ** Following is a simplest sample (JFrame based) which shows you how to call exit method Best way to close a Swing frame programmatically is to make it behave like it would when the "X" button is pressed. To do that you will need to implement WindowAdapter that suits your needs and set frame\'s default close operation to do nothing (DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE).Initialize your frame like this:You can close the frame programmatically by sending it the WINDOW_CLOSING event, like this:This will close the frame like the "X" button was pressed.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);Not only closes the JFrame but the shutdowns the entire application, hence "EXIT ON CLOSE"To achieve the same result you have to effectively exit the application, for that simply call The effect is exactly the same. This examples shows how to realize the confirmed window close operation.The window has a Window adapter which switches the default close operation to EXIT_ON_CLOSEor DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE dependent on your answer in the OptionDialog.The method closeWindow of the ConfirmedCloseWindow fires a close window event and can be used anywhere i.e. as an action of an menu itemIf you really do not want your application to terminate when a JFrame is closed then,use : setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);instead of : setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);Here\'s a synopsis of what the solution looks like,Here would be your options:You have to insert the call into the AWT message queue so all the timing happens correctly, otherwise it will not dispatch the correct event sequence, especially in a multi-threaded program.  When this is done you may handle the resulting event sequence exactly as you would if the user has clicked on the [x] button for an OS suppled decorated JFrame.Based on the answers already provided here, this is the way I implemented it:The JFrame gets the event to close and upon closing, exits.This answer was given by Alex and I would like to recommend it. It worked for me and another thing it\'s straightforward and so simple. Posting what was in the question body as CW answer.Wanted to share the results, mainly derived from following camickr\'s link.  Basically I need to throw a WindowEvent.WINDOW_CLOSING at the application\'s event queue. Here\'s a synopsis of what the solution looks likeIf you do not want your application to terminate when a JFrame is closed, \nuse:\n    setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE)instead of:\n    setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);From the documentation:DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE (defined in WindowConstants): Don\'t do anything; require the program to handle the operation in the windowClosing method of a registered WindowListener object.HIDE_ON_CLOSE (defined in WindowConstants): Automatically hide the frame after invoking any registered WindowListener objects.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE (defined in WindowConstants): Automatically hide and dispose the frame after invoking any registered WindowListener objects.EXIT_ON_CLOSE (defined in JFrame): Exit the application using the System exit method. Use this only in applications.might still be useful:\nYou can use setVisible(false) on your JFrame if you want to display the same frame again.\nOtherwise call dispose() to remove all of the native screen resources.https://stackoverflow.com/a/1944474/3782247I have tried this, write your own code for formWindowClosing() event.This asks user whether he want to exit the Frame or Application.
