I\'m installing the Android SDK on a fresh installation of Fedora 14 (Linux). I installed eclipse, and ran the tools/android sdk tool to install all the Eclipse components for the SDK. I was able to get DDMS to install when selecting it by itself.And for the last component - the Android developer tools, I\'m getting the ugly error message pasted below. Now I\'m Stuck in Eclipse dependency hell. I\'ve searched through the available packages in Fedora and I can\'t find the one that has the files necessary to satisfy this Eclipse dependency. Can anybody please translate what it is that Eclipse is asking for and what Fedora package it lives in?The ugly error:I\'ve just encountered exactly the same problem in Eclipse 3.6 (Helios). After plenty of Googling I came across this link:http://code.google.com/intl/es/eclipse/docs/faq.html#wstinstallerrorDuring installation, there\'s an error\n  about requiring\n  org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui.

Make sure you use the right version of Eclipse, and you may have to run Eclipse as root when installing.The issue is that the versions of Eclipse that ship with Linux distributions are usually very generic in their configuration.
