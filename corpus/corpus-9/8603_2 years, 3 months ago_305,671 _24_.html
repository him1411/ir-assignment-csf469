How do you open IIS (Internet Information Services) Manager using Windows 10?I have installed the developer preview of Windows 10 and cant seem to find IIS Manager?  It is not in Control Panel > Administrative Tools.When I browse to the folder C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv it is empty.I did a full search of my hard drive to find inetmgr.exe and found three copys and none of them would open, when I tried to open them it says "This App cannot Run on your PC"  To find a version of the App that works contact the publisher.I know IIS works because I have ran local ASP.net apps through VisualStudio but I cant seem to find a way to launch IIS Manager to do some configurations for a site.Anyone know anything about this?Thanks to @SLaks comment above I was able to turn on IIS and bring the manager back.Press the Windows Key and type Windows Features, select the first entry Turn Windows Features On or Off.Make sure the box next to IIS is checked.If it is not checked, check it.  This might take a few minutes, but this will install everything you need to use IIS.When it is done, IIS should have returned to Control Panel > Administrative ToolsUnder the windows feature list, make sure to check the IIS Management Console \nYou also need to check additional check boxes as shown below\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/Tgf3W.pngActually you must make sure that the IIS Management Console feature is explicitly checked. On my win 10 pro I had to do it manually, checking the root only was not enough!after turning IIS on (by going to Windows Features On/Off) type inetmgr in search bar or run@user1664035 & @Attila Mika\'s suggestion worked. You have to navigate to Control Panel -> Programs And Features -> Turn Windows Features On or Off. And refer to the screenshot. You should check IIS Management console.ScreenshotMattyMerrix elaborated very well, i want to add that if you can see "ask me any thing" box i.e. Cortana "the intelligent software" at the task bar then there is no need to press the windows key.It most likely means that IIS Management Console was not installed, and modern Windows administrator/IT pro should be able to quickly check this by issuing this command:And if it is missing just quickly add this via the following command:GUI options mentioned above are also valid (see answer from @Joe Wu) but PowerShell it is best way to do IT for IT Pro or let\'s put it as "if you have to do this slightly more often than once a year" :)Launch Windows Features On/Off and select your IIS options for installation.For custom site configuration, ensure IIS Management Console is marked for installation under Web Management Tools.
