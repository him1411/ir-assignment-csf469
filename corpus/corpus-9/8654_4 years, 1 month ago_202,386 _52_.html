I have the following:Is there a way that I could limit the length of the string to say 20 characters?And an even better question would be is there a way that I could change the string to be truncated and show ... at the end if it\'s more than 20 characters?Edit\nThe latest version of AngularJSoffers limitTo filter.You need a custom filter like this:Another solution: http://ngmodules.org/modules/angularjs-truncate (by @Ehvince)Here is the simple one line fix without css.I know this is late, but in the latest version of angularjs (I\'m using 1.2.16) the limitTo filter supports strings as well as arrays so you can limit the length of the string like this:which will output:You can simply add a css class to the div, and add a tool tip via angularjs so that trimmed text will be visible on mouse over.I had a similar problem, here is what i did:More elegant solution:HTML:Angular Code:Demo:http://code-chunk.com/chunks/547bfb3f15aa1/str-limit-implementation-for-angularjsSince we need ellipsis only when the string length is over the limit, it seems more appropriate to add ellipsis by using ng-if than binding.There is an optionHere\'s a custom filter for truncating text. It\'s inspired by EpokK\'s solution but modified for my needs and tastes.And here are the unit tests so you can see how it\'s supposed to behave:You can limit the length of a string or an array by using a filter. Check this one written by the AngularJS team.In html its used along with limitTo filter provided by angular itself as below,filter keepDots :This may not be from the script end but you can use the below css and add this class to the div. This will truncate the text and also show full text on mouseover. You can add a more text and add a angular click hadler to change the class of div on cliIf you want something like :  InputString => StringPart1...StringPart2HTML:Angular Code:Example with following parameters :\nbeginLimit = 10\nendLimit = 20  Before:\n-  /home/house/room/etc/ava_B0363852D549079E3720DF6680E17036.jar\nAfter:\n-  /home/hous...3720DF6680E17036.jarThe simplest solution I found for simply limiting the string length was {{ modal.title | slice:0:20 }}, and then borrowing from @Govan above you can use {{ modal.title.length > 20 ? \'...\' : \'\'}} to add the suspension points if the string is longer than 20, so the final result is simply: {{ modal.title | slice:0:20 }}{{ modal.title.length > 20 ? \'...\' : \'\'}}https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/SlicePipe-pipe.htmlYou can use this npm module: https://github.com/sparkalow/angular-truncateInject the truncate filter into your app module like this: and apply the filter in your app this way: THE EASIEST SOLUTION --> i\'ve found is to let Material Design (1.0.0-rc4) do the work. The md-input-container will do the work for you.  It concats the string and adds elipses  plus it has the extra advantage of allowing you to click it to get the full text so it\'s the whole enchilada.  You may need to set the width of the md-input-container.  HTML:CS:I created this directive that easily does that, truncates the string to a specified limit and adds a "show more/less" toggle. You can find it on GitHub: https://github.com/doukasd/AngularJS-Componentsit can be used like this:Here\'s the directive:And some CSS to go with it:This solution is purely using ng tag on HTML. The solution is to limit the long text displayed with \'show more...\' link at the end of it. If user click \'show more...\' link, it will show the rest of the text and removed the \'show more...\' link.HTML:Limit the number of words with a custom Angular filter:\nHere is how I used an Angular filter to limit the number of words displayed using a custom filter.HTML:Angular/Javascript CodeIt works ok for me\n \'In span\', ng-show = "MyCtrl.value.$viewValue.length > your_limit" ...read more. \'end span\'If you have two bindings {{item.name}} and {{item.directory}}.And want to show the data as a directory followed by the name, assuming \'/root\' as the directory and \'Machine\' as the name (/root-machine).
