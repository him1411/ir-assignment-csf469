You can have 80-characters / right margin line in Netbeans, Text Mate and probably many, many more other IDEs. Is it possible to have it in Sublime Text 3 as well? Any option, plugin etc.?Yes, it is possible both in Sublime Text 2 and 3 (which you should really upgrade to if you haven\'t already - don\'t worry about the "beta" name, it\'s rock-solid). Select View \xe2\x86\x92 Ruler \xe2\x86\x92 80 (there are several other options there as well). If you like to actually wrap your text at 80 columns, select View \xe2\x86\x92 Word Wrap Column \xe2\x86\x92 80. Make sure that View \xe2\x86\x92 Word Wrap is selected.To make your selections permanent (the default for all opened files or views), open Preferences \xe2\x86\x92 Settings\xe2\x80\x94User and use any of the following rules:These settings can also be used in a .sublime-project file to set defaults on a per-project basis, or in a syntax-specific .sublime-settings file if you only want them to apply to files written in a certain language (Python.sublime-settings vs. JavaScript.sublime-settings, for example). Access these settings files by opening a file with the desired syntax, then selecting Preferences \xe2\x86\x92 Settings\xe2\x80\x94More \xe2\x86\x92 Syntax Specific\xe2\x80\x94User.As always, if you have multiple entries in your settings file, separate them with commas , except for after the last one. The entire content should be enclosed in curly braces { }. Basically, make sure it\'s valid JSON.If you\'d like a key combo to automatically set the ruler at 80 for a particular view/file, or you are interested in learning how to set the value without using the mouse, please see my answer here.Finally, as mentioned in another answer, you really should be using a monospace font in order for your code to line up correctly. Other types of fonts have variable-width letters, which means one 80-character line may not appear to be the same length as another 80-character line with different content, and your indentations will look all messed up. Sublime has monospace fonts set by default, but you can of course choose any one you want. Personally, I really like Liberation Mono. It has glyphs to support many different languages and Unicode characters, looks good at a variety of different sizes, and (most importantly for a programming font) clearly differentiates between 0 and O (digit zero and capital letter oh) and 1 and l (digit one and lowercase letter ell), which not all monospace fonts do, unfortunately. Version 2.0 and later of the font are licensed under the open-source SIL Open Font License 1.1 (here is the FAQ).For this to work, your font also needs to be set to monospace.\nIf you think about it, lines can\'t otherwise line up perfectly perfectly.This answer is detailed at sublime text forum:\nhttp://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&p=42052\nThis answer has links for choosing an appropriate font for your OS,\nand gives an answer to an edge case of fonts not lining up.Another website that lists great monospaced free fonts for programmers.\nhttp://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fontsOn stackoverflow, see:Michael Ruth\'s answer here:\nHow to make ruler always be shown in Sublime text 2?MattDMo\'s answer here:\nWhat is the default font of Sublime Text?I have rulers set at the following:\n30\n50 (git commit message titles should be limited to 50 characters)\n72 (git commit message details should be limited to 72 characters)\n80 (Windows Command Console Window maxes out at 80 character width)  Other viewing environments that benefit from shorter lines: \ngithub: there is no word wrap when viewing a file online\n  So, I try to keep .js .md and other files at 70-80 characters.\nWindows Console: 80 characters.
