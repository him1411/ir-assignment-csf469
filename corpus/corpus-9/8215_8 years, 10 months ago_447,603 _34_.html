What is the regular expression for a decimal with a precision of 2?Valid examples:Invalid examples:The decimal point may be optional, and integers may also be included.Valid regex tokens vary by implementation.  The most generic form that I know of would be:The most compact:Both assume that you must have both at least one digit before and one after the decimal place.To require that the whole string is a number of this form, wrap the expression in start and end tags such as (in Perl\'s form):ADDED: Wrapped the fractional portion in ()? to make it optional.  Be aware that this excludes forms such as "12."  Including that would be more like ^\\d+\\.?\\d{0,2}$.And since regular expressions are horrible to read, much less understand, here is the verbose equivalent:You can replace [0-9] with \\d in most regular expression implementations (including PCRE, the most common). I\'ve left it as [0-9] as I think it\'s easier to read.Also, here is the simple Python script I used to check it:To include an optional minus sign and to disallow numbers like 015 (which can be mistaken for octal numbers) write:For numbers that don\'t have a thousands separator, I like this simple, compact regex:or, to not be limited to a precision of 2:The latter matches\n1\n100\n100.\n100.74\n100.7\n0.7\n.7\n.72And it doesn\'t match empty string (like \\d*.?\\d* would)Will make things like 12. accepted. This is not what is commonly accepted but if in case you need to be \xe2\x80\x9cflexible\xe2\x80\x9d, that is one way to go. And of course [0-9] can be replaced with \\d, but I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s more readable this way.Try thisIt will allow positive and negative signs also.I use this one for up to two decimal places:\n(^(\\+|\\-)(0|([1-9][0-9]*))(\\.[0-9]{1,2})?$)|(^(0{0,1}|([1-9][0-9]*))(\\.[0-9]{1,2})?$)\npasses:\n.25\n0.25\n10.25\n+0.25\n\ndoesn\'t pass:\n-.25\n01.25\n1.\n1.256In general, i.e. unlimited decimal places:^-?(([1-9]\\d*)|0)(.0*[1-9](0*[1-9])*)?$.Won\'t you need to take the e in e666.76 into account?WithI tried one with my project.\nThis allows numbers with + | - signs as well./^(+|-)?[0-9]{0,}((.){1}[0-9]{1,}){0,1}$/adding my answer too, someone might find it useful or may be correct mine too.This worked with me:Group 1 is the your float number and group 2 is the fraction only.Chrome 56 is not accepting this kind of patterns (Chrome 56 is accpeting 11.11. an additional .) with type number, use type as text as progress.function will validate any decimal number weather number has decimal places or not, it will say "Right Number" other wise "Please enter only numbers into amount textbox." alert message will come up.Thanks... :)
