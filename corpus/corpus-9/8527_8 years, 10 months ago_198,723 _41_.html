This question already has an answer here:In python, if I sayI get the letter h and a newline.  If I say I get the letter h and no newline.  If I sayI get the letter h, a space, and the letter m.  How can I prevent Python from printing the space?The print statements are different iterations of the same loop so I can\'t just use the + operator.You can use:Just a comment. In Python 3, you will useto suppress the endline terminator, andto suppress the whitespace separator between items.Greg is right-- you can use sys.stdout.writePerhaps, though, you should consider refactoring your algorithm to accumulate a list of <whatevers> and thenOr use a +, i.e.:Just make sure all are concatenate-able objects.But really, you should use sys.stdout.write directly.For completeness, one other way is to clear the softspace value after performing the write.prints helloworld !Using stdout.write() is probably more convenient for most cases though.This may look stupid, but seems to be the simplest:Regain control of your console! Simply:where __past__.py contains:then:Bonus extra: If you don\'t like print >> f, ..., you can extending this caper to fprintf(f, ...).I am not adding a new answer. I am just putting the best marked answer in a better format.\nI can see that the best answer by rating is using sys.stdout.write(someString). You can try this out:will yield:That is all.In python 2.6:So using print_function from __future__ you can set explicitly the sep and end parameteres of print function.You can use print like the printf function in C.e.g.print "%s%s" % (x, y)sys.stdout.write is (in Python 2) the only robust solution. Python 2 printing is insane. Consider this code:This will print a b, leading you to suspect that it is printing a trailing space. But this is not correct. Try this instead:This will print a0b. How do you explain that? Where have the spaces gone?I still can\'t quite make out what\'s really going on here. Could somebody look over my best guess:My attempt at deducing the rules when you have a trailing , on your print:First, let\'s assume that print    , (in Python 2) doesn\'t print any whitespace (spaces nor newlines).Python 2 does, however, pay attention to how you are printing - are you using print, or sys.stdout.write, or something else? If you make two consecutive calls to print, then Python will insist on putting in a space in between the two.it will produce first line second lineI had the same problem once I wanted to read some digits from a file. I solved it like this:
