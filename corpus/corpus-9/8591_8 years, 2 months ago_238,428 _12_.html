I have a use case where I need to call a (non-static) method in the bean only-once at the ApplicationContext load up. Is it ok, if I use MethodInvokingFactoryBean for this? Or we have a some better solution?As a side note, I use ConfigContextLoaderListener to load the Application Context in web application. And want, that if bean \'A\' is instantiated just call methodA() once.How can this be done nicely?You can use something like:This will call the "init" method when the bean is instantiated.To expand on the @PostConstruct suggestion in other answers, this really is the best solution, in my opinion.There are three different approaches to consider, as described in the referenceHave you tried implementing InitializingBean? It sounds like exactly what you\'re after.The downside is that your bean becomes Spring-aware, but in most applications that\'s not so bad.You could deploy a custom BeanPostProcessor in your application context to do it. Or if you don\'t mind implementing a Spring interface in your bean, you could use the InitializingBean interface or the "init-method" directive (same link).To further clear any confusion about the two approach i.e use ofFrom personal experience, I realized that using (1) only works in a servlet container, while (2) works in any environment, even in desktop applications. So, if you would be using Spring in a standalone application, you would have to use (2) to carry out that "call this method after initialization.
