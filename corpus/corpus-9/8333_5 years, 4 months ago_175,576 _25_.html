I\'m looking for an operator, which allows me to check, if the value of a field contains a certain string. Something like:Is that possible? You can do it with the following code.As Mongo shell support regex, that\'s completely possible.If we want the query to be case-insensitive, we can use "i" option, like shown below:See: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries#AdvancedQueries-RegularExpressionshttp://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/SQL+to+Mongo+Mapping+Charthttp://php.net/manual/en/mongo.sqltomongo.phpMySQLMongoDBAs of version 2.4, you can create a text index on the field(s) to search and use the $text operator for querying.First, create the index:db.users.createIndex( { "username": "text" } )Then, to search:db.users.find( { $text: { $search: "son" } } )Benchmarks (~150K documents):Notes:Here\'s what you have to do if you are connecting MongoDB through Pythonyou may also use a variable name instead of \'Son\' and therefore the string concatenation.As this is one of the first hits in the search engines, and none of the above seems to work for MongoDB 3.x, here is one regex search that does work:No need to create and extra index or alike.Simplest way to accomplish this task If you want the query to be case-sensitiveIf you want the query to be case-insensitive
