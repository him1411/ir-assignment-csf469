I\'m looking for an equivalent to addHeaderView for a recycler view. Basically I want to have an image with 2 buttons be added as a header to the listview. Is there a different way to add a header view to a recycler view? An example for guidance would be helpfulEDIT 2 (added fragment layouts):After adding log statements, it seems as though getViewType only ever receives a position of 0. This leads to onCreateView only loading the one layout:The fragment transition to load the CommentFragment:The Fragment\'s onCreateView:The fragment containing the recycleview:The comments row layout:The headerThe Adapter code (thanks to hister for getting me started):Using the above code, only the header layout is displayed as viewType is always 0. It looks like this. If I force the other layout it looks like this:There isn\'t an easy way like listview.addHeaderView() but you can achieve this by adding a type to your adapter for header.Here is an examplelink to gist -> here Static headers can easily be added with an ItemDecoration and without any further changes.The decoration is also reusable since there is no need to modify the adapter or the RecyclerView at all.The sample code provided below will require a view to add to the top which can just be inflated like everything else. It can look like this:If you just have to display text and images this solution is for youâ€”there is no possibility for user interaction like buttons or view pagers, since it will just be drawn to top of your list.If there is no view to decorate, the decoration will not be drawn. You will still have to handle an empty list yourself. (One possible workaround would be to add a dummy item to the adapter.)You can find the full source code here on GitHub including a Builder to help with the initialization of the decorator, or just use the code below and supply your own values to the constructor.Please be sure to set a correct layout_height for your view. e.g. match_parent might not work properly.Please note: The GitHub project is my personal playground. It is not thorougly tested, which is why there is no library yet.An ItemDecoration is additional drawing to an item of a list. In this case, a decoration is drawn to the top of the first item.The view gets measured and laid out, then it is drawn to the top of the first item. If a parallax effect is added it will also be clipped to the correct bounds.Feel free to use my library, available here.It let\'s you create header View for any RecyclerView that uses LinearLayoutManager or GridLayoutManager with just a simple method call.You can just place your header and your RecyclerView in a NestedScrollView:In order for scrolling to work correctly, you need to disable nested scrolling on your RecyclerView:You can achieve it using the library SectionedRecyclerViewAdapter, it has the concept of "Sections", where which Section has a Header, Footer and Content (list of items). In your case you might only need one Section but you can have many:Based on this post, I created a subclass of RecyclerView.Adapter that supports an arbitrary number of headers and footers.https://gist.github.com/mheras/0908873267def75dc746Although it seems to be a solution, I also think this thing should be managed by the LayoutManager. Unfortunately, I need it now and I don\'t have time to implement a StaggeredGridLayoutManager from scratch (nor even extend from it).I\'m still testing it, but you can try it out if you want. Please let me know if you find any issues with it.Native API doesn\'t have such "addHeader" feature, but has the concept of "addItem".I was able to include this specific feature of headers and extends for footers as well in my FlexibleAdapter project. I called it Scrollable Headers and Footers.Here how they work:Scrollable Headers and Footers are special items that scroll along with all others, but they don\'t belongs to main items (business items) and they are always handled by the adapter beside the main items. Those items are persistently located at the first and last positions.There\'s a lot to say about them, better to read the detailed wiki page.Moreover the FlexibleAdapter allows you to create headers/sections, also you can have them sticky and tens of others features like expandable items, endless scroll, UI extensions etc... all in one library!There is one more solution that covers all the use cases above: CompoundAdapter:\nhttps://github.com/negusoft/CompoundAdapter-androidYou can create a AdapterGroup that holds your Adapter as it is, along with an adapter with a single item to represent the header. The code is easy and readable:AdapterGroup allows nesting too, so for a adapter with sections, you may create a AdapterGroup per section. Then put all the sections in a root AdapterGroup.Going to show you to make header with items in a Recycler view.Step 1- Add dependency into your gradle file.Cardview is used for decoration purpose.Step2- Make three xml files.\nOne for main activity.Second for Header layout.Third for list item layout.activity_main.xmlheader.xmllist.xmlStep 3-  Create three bean classes.Header.javaContentItem.javaListItem.javaStep 4- Create an adapter named MyRecyclerAdapter.javaStep 5- \nIn MainActivity add the following code:The function getList() is dynamically generating the data for the headers and for list items.HeaderView depends on the LayoutManager. None of the default LayoutManagers support this and probably wont. HeaderView in ListView creates a lot of complexity without any significant benefit.I would suggest creating a base adapter class that adds items for Headers if provided. Don\'t forget to override notify* methods to offset them properly depending on whether header is present or not.After - Override the method getItemViewTpe\n***More Importantmethod onCreateViewHoldermethod onBindViewHolderin finish implements the ViewHolders class static Probably http://alexzh.com/tutorials/multiple-row-layouts-using-recyclerview/ will help. It uses only RecyclerView and CardView.\nHere is an adapter:And here\'s an entity:here some itemdecoration for recyclerview    you can create addHeaderView and use\nadapter.addHeaderView(View).This code build the addHeaderView for more then one header.\nthe headers should have:\n android:layout_height="wrap_content"}I made an implementation based on @hister\'s one for my personal purposes, but using inheritance. I hide the implementation details mechanisms (like add 1 to itemCount, subtract 1 from position) in an abstract super class HeadingableRecycleAdapter, by\nimplementing required methods from Adapter like onBindViewHolder, getItemViewType and getItemCount, making that methods final, and providing new methods with hidden logic to client: onAddViewHolder(RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder, int position), onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent),\nitemCount()Here are the HeadingableRecycleAdapter class and a client. I left the header layout a bit hard-coded because it fits my needs.
