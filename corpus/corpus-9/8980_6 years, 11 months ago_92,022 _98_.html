Trying to work on my both my actual "work" repos, and my personal repos on git hub, from my computer.The work account was set up first, and everything works flawlessly.My personal account, however cannot seem to push to my personal repo, which is set up under a different account/email.I\'ve tried copying my work key up to my personal account, but that throws an error, because of course a key can be only attached to one account.How can I push/pull to and from both accounts, from their respective github credentials?All you need to do is configure your SSH setup with multiple SSH keypairs.This link is easy to follow (Thanks Eric):\nhttp://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574Generating SSH keys (Win/msysgit)\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/Also, if you\'re working with multiple repositories using different personas, you need to make sure that your individual repositories have the user settings overridden accordingly:Setting user name, email and GitHub token \xe2\x80\x93 Overriding settings for individual repos\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/Hope this helps.EDIT:\nUpdated linksUse HTTPS:change remote url to https:and you are good to go:To ensure that the commits appear as performed by USERNAME, one can setup the user.name and user.email for this project, too:By creating different host aliases to github.com in your ~/.ssh/config,\nand giving each host alias its own ssh key, you can easily use multiple\ngithub accounts without confusion.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s because github.com distinguishes not by user, which is always just git,\nbut by the ssh key you used to connect.\nJust configure your remote origins using your own host aliases.\xe2\x80\x9dThe above summary is courtesy of comments on the blog post below.I\'ve found this explanation the clearest. And it works for me, at least as of April 2012.http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts/The details at http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts/ linked to by mishaba work very well for me.From that page:Then edit that file to be something like this (one entry per account):I use shell scripts to switch me to whatever account I want to be "active". Essentially you start from a fresh start, get one account configured properly and working, then move the these files to a name with the proper prefix. From then on you can use the command "github", or "gitxyz" to switch:I\'ve had great luck with this. I also created a run script in Xcode (for you Mac users) so it would not build my project unless I had the proper setting (since its using git):Run Script placed after Dependencies (using /bin/ksh as the shell):EDIT: added tests for new files existence and copying old files to /tmp to address comment by @naomik below.Thanks user1107028:Use HTTPS:change remote url to https:git remote set-url origin\n  https://USERNAME@github.com/USERNAME/PROJECTNAME.git and you are good\n  to go:git pushI found this the best way when using multiple github accounts. I cant use only one account, its just not possible, and I couldnt get SSH to behave no matter what i did. Id have voted up the answer but i dont have enough points - I wanted to acknowledge this simple workaround for those like me who need a clean easy solution. It worked first time and saved me hours more struggling.Getting into shapeTo manage a git repo under a separate github/bitbucket/whatever account, you simply need to generate a new SSH key.But before we can start pushing/pulling repos with your second identity, we gotta get you into shape \xe2\x80\x93 Let\'s assume your system is setup with a typical id_rsa and id_rsa.pub key pair. Right now your tree ~/.ssh looks like thisFirst, name that key pair \xe2\x80\x93 adding a descriptive name will help you remember which key is used for which user/remoteNext, let\'s generate a new key pair \xe2\x80\x93 here I\'ll name the new key github-otheruserNow, when we look at tree ~/.ssh we seeNext, we need to setup a ~/.ssh/config file that will define our key configurations. We\'ll create it with the proper owner-read/write-only permissionsOpen that with your favourite editor, and add the following contentsPresumably, you\'ll have some existing repos associated with your primary github identity. For that reason, the "default" github.com Host is setup to use your mainuser key. If you don\'t want to favour one account over another, I\'ll show you how to update existing repos on your system to use an updated ssh configuration.Add your new SSH key to githubHead over to github.com/settings/keys to add your new public keyYou can get the public key contents using: copy/paste it to githubNow your new user identity is all setup \xe2\x80\x93 below we\'ll show you how to use it.Getting stuff done: cloning a repoSo how does this come together to work with git and github? Well because you can\'t have a chicken without and egg, we\'ll look at cloning an existing repo. This situation might apply to you if you have a new github account for your workplace and you were added to a company project.Let\'s say github.com/someorg/somerepo already exists and you were added to it \xe2\x80\x93 cloning is as easy asThat bolded portion must match the Host name we setup in your ~/.ssh/config file. That correctly connects git to the corresponding IdentityFile and properly authenticates you with githubGetting stuff done: creating a new repoWell because you can\'t have a chicken without and egg, we\'ll look at publishing a new repo on your secondary account. This situation applies to users that are create new content using their secondary github account.Let\'s assume you\'ve already done a little work locally and you\'re now ready to push to github. You can follow along with me if you\'d likeNow configure this repo to use your identityNow make your first commitCheck the commit to see your new identity was used using git logAlright, time to push to github! Since github doesn\'t know about our new repo yet, first go to github.com/new and create your new repo \xe2\x80\x93 name it somerepoNow, to configure your repo to "talk" to github using the correct identity/credentials, we have add a remote. Assuming your github username for your new account is someuser ...That bolded portion is absolutely critical and it must match the Host that we defined in your ~/.ssh/config fileLastly, push the repoUpdate an existing repo to use a new SSH configurationSay you already have some repo cloned, but now you want to use a new SSH configuration. In the example above, we kept your existing repos in tact by assigning your previous id_rsa/id_rsa.pub key pair to Host github.com in your SSH config file. There\'s nothing wrong with this, but I have at least 5 github configurations now and I don\'t like thinking of one of them as the "default" configuration \xe2\x80\x93 I\'d rather be explicit about each one.Before we had thisSo we will now update that to this (changes in bold)But that means that now any existing repo with a github.com remote will no longer work with this identity file. But don\'t worry, it\'s a simple fix.To update any existing repo to use your new SSH configuration, simply open the repo\'s git config file and update the url!Update the remote origin field (changes in bold)That\'s it. Now you can push/pull to your heart\'s contentSSH key file permissionsIf you\'re running into trouble with your public keys not working correctly, SSH is quite strict on the file permissions allowed on your ~/.ssh directory and corresponding key filesAs a rule of thumb, any directories should be 700 and any files should be 600 - this means they are owner-read/write-only \xe2\x80\x93 no other group/user can read/write themHow I manage my SSH keysI manage separate SSH keys for every host I connect to, such that if any one key is ever compromised, I don\'t have to update keys on every other place I\'ve used that key. This is like when you get that notification from Adobe that 150 million of their users\' information was stolen \xe2\x80\x93 now you have to cancel that credit card and update every service that depends on it \xe2\x80\x93 what a nuisance.Here\'s what my ~/.ssh directory looks like: I have one .pem key for each user, in a folder for each domain I connect to. I use .pem keys to so I only need one file per key.And here\'s my corresponding /.ssh/config file \xe2\x80\x93 obviously the github stuff is relevant to answering this question about github, but this answer aims to equip you with the knowledge to manage your ssh identities on any number of services/machines.Getting your SSH public key from a PEM keyAbove you noticed that I only have one file for each key. When I need to provide a public key, I simply generate it as needed.So when github asks for your ssh public key, run this command to output the public key to stdout \xe2\x80\x93 copy/paste where neededNote, this is also the same process I use for adding my key to any remote machine. The ssh-rsa AAAA... value is copied to the remote\'s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys fileConverting your id_rsa/id_rsa.pub key pairs to PEM formatSo you want to tame you key files and cut down on some file system cruft? Converting your key pair to a single PEM is easyOr, following along with our examples above, we renamed id_rsa -> github-mainuser and id_rsa.pub -> github-mainuser.pub \xe2\x80\x93 soNow just to make sure that we\'ve converted this correct, you will want to verify that the generated public key matches your old public keyNow that you have your github-mainuser.pem file, you can safely delete your old github-mainuser and github-mainuser.pub files \xe2\x80\x93 only the PEM file is necessary; just generate the public key whenever you need it ^_^Creating PEM keys from scratchYou don\'t need to create the private/public key pair and then convert to a single PEM key. You can create the PEM key directly.Let\'s create a newuser.pemGetting the SSH public key is the sameI found this gem to be very useful: sshwitchhttps://github.com/agush22/sshwitch\nhttp://rubygems.org/gems/sshwitchIt helps to switch out ssh keys. Remember to back up everything first!Also to make sure that commits have the correct email address associated with them, I made sure that the ~/.gitconfig file had the proper email address.Beside of creating multiple SSH Keys for multiple accounts you can also consider to add collaborators on each project using the same account emails and store the password permanently.I have setup multiple accounts with different emails then put the same user and email on each account as one of the collaborators. By this way I can access to all account without adding SSH Key, or switching to another username, and email for the authentication.This answer is for beginners (none-git gurus). I recently had this problem and maybe its just me but most of the answers seemed to require rather advance understanding of git. After reading several stack overflow answers including this thread, here are the steps I needed to take in order to easily switch between GitHub accounts (assuming you have two GitHub accounts, github.com/personal and gitHub.com/work): Edit the global git configuration: Last step is to make sure the global configuration file is aware of all github accounts (so to say). Run git config --global --edit to edit this global file, if this opens vim and you don\'t know how to use it, press i to enter Insert mode, edit the file as below, and press esc followed by :wq to exit insert mode: [inside this square brackets give a name to the followed acc.]\n  name = github_username\n  email = github_emailaddress\n[any other name]\n  name = github_username\n  email = github_email\n[credential]\n  helper = osxkeychain\n  useHttpPath = trueDone!, now when trying to push or pull from a repo, you\'ll be asked which GitHub account should be linked with this repo and its asked only once, the local configuration will remember this link and not the global configuration so you can work on different repos that are linked with different accounts without having to edit global configuration each time.
