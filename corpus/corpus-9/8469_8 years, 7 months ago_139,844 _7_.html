Is there a word-wrap or any other attribute that stops text from wrapping?  I have a height, and overflow:hidden, and the text still breaks.Needs to work in all browsers, before CSS3.Note: this only works on block elements.  If you need to do this to table cells (for example) you need to put a div inside the table cell as table cells have display table-cell not block.As of CSS3, this is supported for table cells as well.You can use CSS white-space Property to achieve this.Using ellipsis will add the ... at the last.Sometimes using &nbsp; instead of spaces will work. Clearly it has drawbacks, though.
