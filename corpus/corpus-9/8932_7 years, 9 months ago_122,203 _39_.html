Anyone know of a command-line CSV viewer for Linux/OS X?  I\'m thinking of something like less but that spaces out the columns in a more readable way.  (I\'d be fine with opening it with OpenOffice Calc or Excel, but that\'s way too overpowered for just looking at the data like I need to.)  Having horizontal and vertical scrolling would be great.You can also use this:column is a standard unix program that is very convenient -- it finds the appropriate width of each column, and displays the text as a nicely formatted table.Note: whenever you have empty fields, you need to put some kind of placeholder in it, otherwise the column gets merged with following columns. The following example demonstrates how to use sed to insert a placeholder:Note that the substitution of ,, for , , is done twice. If you do it only once, 1,,,4 will become 1, ,,4 since the second comma is matched already.You can install csvtool (on Ubuntu) via and then run:This will make it nice and pretty inside of a read-only vim instance, even if you have some cells with very long values.Have a look at csvkit. It provides a set of tools that adhere to the UNIX philosophy (meaning they are small, simple, single-purposed and can be combined). Here is an example that extracts the ten most populated cities in Germany from the free Maxmind World Cities database and displays the result in a console-readable format:Csvkit is platform independent because it is written in Python. If you\'re a vimmer, use the CSV plugin, which is juuust beautiful. Tabview: lightweight python curses command line CSV file viewer (and also other tabular Python data, like a list of lists) is here on GithubMy FOSS project CSVfix allows you to display CSV files in "ASCII art" table format.Ofri\'s answer gives you everything you asked for.\nBut.. if you don\'t want to remember the command you can add this to your ~/.bashrc (or equivalent):This is exactly the same as Ofri\'s answer except I have wrapped it in a shell function and am using the less -S option to stop the wrapping of lines (makes less behaves more like a office/oocalc).Open a new shell (or type source ~/.bashrc in your current shell) and run the command using:csview <filename>The nodejs package tecfu/tty-table can be globally installed to do precisely this:It can also handle streams.For more info, see the docs for terminal usage here.I used pisswillis\'s answer for a long time.But then combined some code I found at http://chrisjean.com/2011/06/17/view-csv-data-from-the-command-line which works better for me:The reason it works better for me is that it handles wide columns better.tblless in the Tabulator package wraps the unix column command, and also aligns numeric columns.Using TxtSushi you can do:xsv is more than a viewer. I recommend it for most CSV task on the command line, especially when dealing with large datasets.Here\'s a (probably too) simple option:I wrote this csv_view.sh to format CSVs from the command line, this reads the entire file to figure out the optimal width of each column (requires perl, assumes there are no commas in fields, also uses less):I wrote a script, viewtab , in Groovy for just this purpose. You invoke it like:It is basically a super-lightweight spreadsheet that can be invoked from the command line, handles CSV and tab separated files, can read VERY large files that Excel and Numbers choke on, and is very fast.  It\'s not command-line in the sense of being text-only, but it is platform independent and will probably fit the bill for many people looking for a solution to the problem of quickly inspecting many or large CSV files while working in a command line environment. The script and how to install it are described here:http://bayesianconspiracy.blogspot.com/2012/06/quick-csvtab-file-viewer.htmlThere\'s this short command line script in python: https://github.com/rgrp/csv2ascii/blob/master/csv2ascii.pyJust download and place in your path. Usage is likeConvert csv file at csv-file-path to ascii form returning the result on\nstdout. If csv-file-path = \'-\' then read from stdin.Options:Yet another multi-functional CSV (and not only) manipulation tool: Miller. From its own description, it is like awk, sed, cut, join, and sort for name-indexed data such as CSV, TSV, and tabular JSON. (link to github repository: https://github.com/johnkerl/miller)
