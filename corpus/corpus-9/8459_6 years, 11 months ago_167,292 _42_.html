I don\'t want my user to even try downloading something unless they have Wi-Fi connected. However, I can only seem to be able to tell if Wi-Fi is enabled, but they could still have a 3G connection.However, the state is not what I would expect. Even though Wi-Fi is connected, I am getting OBTAINING_IPADDR as the state.You should be able to use the ConnectivityManager to get the state of the Wi-Fi adapter. From there you can check if it is connected or even available.NOTE: It should be noted (for us n00bies here) that you need to addto yourAndroidManifest.xml for this to work.NOTE2: public NetworkInfo getNetworkInfo (int networkType) is now deprecated:This method was deprecated in API level 23. This method does not\n  support multiple connected networks of the same type. Use\n  getAllNetworks() and getNetworkInfo(android.net.Network) instead.Since the method NetworkInfo.isConnected() is now deprecated in API-23, here is a method which detects if the Wi-Fi adapter is on and also connected to an access point using WifiManager instead:I simply use the following:    Which will return one of these states at the time you call getSupplicantState();ASSOCIATED - Association completed. ASSOCIATING - Trying to associate with\n  an access point.COMPLETED - All authentication\n  completed. DISCONNECTED - This state indicates\n  that client is not associated, but is\n  likely to start looking for an access\n  point. DORMANT - An Android-added state that\n  is reported when a client issues an\n  explicit DISCONNECT command. FOUR_WAY_HANDSHAKE - WPA 4-Way Key\n  Handshake in progress. GROUP_HANDSHAKE  - WPA Group Key\n  Handshake in progress. INACTIVE - Inactive state.INVALID - A pseudo-state that should\n  normally never be seen.SCANNING - Scanning for a network. UNINITIALIZED - No connection.I had a look at a few questions like this and came up with this:I use if for my license check in Root Toolbox PRO, and it seems to work great.I am using this in my apps to check if the active network is Wi-Fi:Try out this method.This method will help to find internet connection available or not.This works for me:And add this permission:While Jason\'s answer is correct, nowadays getNetWorkInfo (int) is a deprecated method. So, the next function would be a nice alternative:Here is what I use as a utility method in my apps:Using WifiManager you can do:The method getNeworkId returns -1 only when it\'s not connected to a network;In new version Androidand add premission tooThis is an easier solution. See Stack Overflow\nquestion Checking Wi-Fi enabled or not on Android.P.S. Do not forget to add the code to the manifest.xml file to allow permission. As shown below.TryThis returns 0 until the device has a usable connection (on my machine, a Samsung SM-T280, Android 5.1.1).You can turn WIFI on if it\'s not activated as the following\n 1. check WIFI state as answered by @Jason Knight\n 2. if not activated, activate it\ndon\'t forget to add WIFI permission in the manifest fileYour Java class should be like that}
