I\'m using the leanback libraries, which require Android 17 or later.  However my app supports a minSDK of 16, so I get a build error from gradle sayingWhen I look at the build tools documentation, I see how to add the overrideLibrary marker to my manifest, but the problem is that I\'m declaring my minSdk in my gradle file instead of in my manifest.How do I use overrideLibrary when the minSdk is declared in build.gradle instead of in AndroidManifest.xml?Open Android Studio -> Open Manifest File add \n<uses-sdk tools:overrideLibrary="android.support.v17.leanback"/> \n don\'t forget to include xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools" too, before the <application> tagit doesn\'t matter that you declare your minSdk in build.gradle. You have to copy overrideLibrary in your AndroidManifest.xml, as documented here.The system automatically ignores the sdkVersion declared in AndroidManifest.xml.I hope this solve your problem.As library requires minSdkVersion 17 then you can change the same in build.gradle(Module:Application) file:and after that building the project should not throw any build error.I just changed minSdkVersion="7" in C:\\MyApp\\platforms\\android\\CordovaLib\\AndroidManifest.xml and it worked.Steps :Path : C:\\MyApp\\platforms\\android\\CordovaLib\\AndroidManifest.xmlValue : <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="7"/>Ran command in new cmd prompt:C:\\MyApp>phonegap build android --debug\n[phonegap] executing \'cordova build android --debug\'...\n[phonegap] completed \'cordova build android --debug\'C:\\MyApp>open your project Manifest File1: add xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools" on top 2:  add  \n3: you should change package name ("fr.data_jack.immocalc") acording to your code
