I have a number of projects built using CMake and I\'d like to be able to easily switch between using GCC or Clang/LLVM to compile them. I believe (please correct me if I\'m mistaken!) that to use Clang I need to set the following:Is there an easy way of switching between these and the default GCC variables, preferably as a system-wide change rather than project specific (i.e. not just adding them into a project\'s CMakeLists.txt)?Also, is it necessary to use the llvm-* programs rather than the system defaults when compiling using clang instead of gcc? What\'s the difference?CMake honors the environment variables CC and CXX upon detecting the C and C++ compiler to use:The compiler specific flags can be overridden by putting them into a system wide CMake file and pointing the CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE variable to it. Create a file ~/ClangOverrides.txt with the following contents:The suffix _INIT will make CMake initialize the corresponding *_FLAGS variable with the given value. Then invoke cmake in the following way:Finally to force the use of the LLVM binutils, set the internal variable _CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX. This variable is honored by the CMakeFindBinUtils module:Putting this all together you can write a shell wrapper which sets up the environment variables CC and CXX and then invokes cmake with the mentioned variable overrides. System wide C++ change on Ubuntu:Will print something like this:Then just select clang++.You can use the option command:and then wrap the clang-compiler settings in if()s:This way it is displayed as an cmake option in the gui-configuration tools.To make it systemwide you can of course use an environment variable as the default value or stay with Ferruccio\'s answer.You definitely don\'t need to use the various different llvm-ar etc programs:These are made to work on the llvm internal format and as such aren\'t useful to the build of your application.As a note -O4 will invoke LTO on your program which you may not want (it will increase compile time greatly) and clang defaults to c99 mode so that flag isn\'t necessarily needed either.System wide C change on Ubuntu:sudo update-alternatives --config ccSystem wide C++ change on Ubuntu:sudo update-alternatives --config c++For each of the above, press Selection number (1) and Enter to select Clang:You can use the syntax: $ENV{environment-variable} in your CMakeLists.txt to access environment variables. You could create scripts which initialize a set of environment variables appropriately and just have references to those variables in your CMakeLists.txt files.According to the help of cmake:You make be able to create files like gcc_compiler.txt and clang_compiler.txt to includes all relative configuration in CMake syntax. Clang Example (clang_compiler.txt):Then run it asGCC:Clang:
