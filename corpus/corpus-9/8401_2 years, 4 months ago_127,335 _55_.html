I\'m trying to convert an angular app from gulp to webpack. in gulp I use gulp-preprocess to replace some variables in the html page (e.g. database name) depending on the NODE_ENV. What is the best way of achieving a similar result with webpack?There are two basic ways to achieve this.Note that this will just replace the matches "as is". That\'s why the string is in the format it is. You could have a more complex structure, such as an object there but you get the idea.EnvironmentPlugin uses DefinePlugin internally and maps the environment values to code through it. Terser syntax.Alternatively you could consume configuration through an aliased module. From consumer side it would look like this:Configuration itself could look like this:Let\'s say process.env.NODE_ENV is development. It would map into ./config/development.js then. The module it maps to can export configuration like this:Just another option, if you want to use only a cli interface, just use the define option of webpack. I add the following script in my package.json :So I just have to run npm run build-production.I investigated a couple of options on how to set environment-specific variables and ended up with this:I have 2 webpack configs currently: webpack.production.config.jswebpack.config.jsIn my code I get the value of API_URL in this (brief) way:const apiUrl = process.env.API_URL;EDIT 3th of Nov, 2016Webpack docs has an example: https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#dependency-injectionWith ESLint you need to specifically allow undefined variables in code, if you have no-undef rule on. http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-undef like this:EDIT 7th of Sep, 2017 (Create-React-App specific)If you\'re not into configuring too much, check out Create-React-App: Create-React-App - Adding Custom Environment Variables. Under the hood CRA uses Webpack anyway.You can directly use the EnvironmentPlugin available in webpack to have access to any environment variable during the transpilation.You just have to declare the plugin in your webpack.config.js file:Note that you must declare explicitly the name of the environment variables you want to use.You can pass command-line arguments using --env in webpack 2:Using the variable in webpack.config.js:SourceTo add to the bunch of answers personally I prefer the following:Using this there is no funky env variable or cross-platform problems (with env vars).  All you do is run the normal webpack or webpack -p for dev or production respectively.Reference: Github issueSince my Edit on the above post by thevangelist wasn\'t approved, posting additional information.If you want to pick value from package.json like a defined version number and access it through DefinePlugin inside Javascript. Then, Import package.json inside respective webpack.config, access the attribute using the import variable, then use the attribute in the DefinePlugin.For example certain configuration on webpack.config is using METADATA for DefinePlugin:  Access this inside any typescript file:The smartest way would be like this:Thanks to Ross AllenJust another answer that is similar to @zer0chain\'s answer. However, with one distinction.It is the same as: And this is the same as So you may only need something like this in package.json Node file:Just a few tips from the DefinePlugin:The DefinePlugin allows you to create global constants which can be configured at compile time. This can be useful for allowing different behavior between development builds and release builds. For example, you might use a global constant to determine whether logging takes place; perhaps you perform logging in your development build but not in the release build. That\'s the sort of scenario the DefinePlugin facilitates.That this is so you can check if you type webpack --helpTo add to the bunch of answers:Use ExtendedDefinePlugin instead of DefinePluginExtendedDefinePlugin is much simpler to use and is documented :-)\nlinkBecause DefinePlugin lacks good documentation, I want to help out, by saying that it actually works like #DEFINE in c#. Thus, if you want to understand how DefinePlugin works, read the  c# #define doucmentation. linkI prefer using .env file for different environment.and in codeuse require(\'dotenv\').config();\nconst API = process.env.API ## which will store the value from .env file\nI don\'t know why but nobody really mentioning the simplest solution. This works for me for nodejs and grunt. As for many people the webpack can be confusing you can simply use the below line:process.env.NODE_ENV = \'production\';With the above solution you don\'t really need to use envify or webpack. Sometimes the simple hardcoded solution may work for some people.
