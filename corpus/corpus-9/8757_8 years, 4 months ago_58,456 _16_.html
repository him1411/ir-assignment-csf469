What is the Ruby <=> (spaceship) operator? Is the operator implemented by any other languages?Perl was likely the first language to use it. Groovy is another language that supports it. Basically instead of returning 1 (true) or 0 (false) depending on whether the arguments are equal or unequal, the spaceship operator will return 1, 0, or \xe2\x88\x921 depending on the value of the left argument relative to the right argument.It\'s useful for sorting an array.The spaceship method is useful when you define it in your own class and include the Comparable module. Your class then gets the >, < , >=, <=, ==, and between? methods for free.It\'s a general comparison operator. It returns either a -1, 0, or +1 depending on whether its receiver is less than, equal to, or greater than its argument.I will explain with simple example[1,3,2] <=> [2,2,2]Ruby will start comparing each element of both array from left hand side.\n1 for left array is smaller than 2 of right array. Hence left array is smaller than right array. Output will be -1.[2,3,2] <=> [2,2,2]As above it will first compare first element which are equal then it will compare second element, in this case second element of left array is greater hence output is 1.What is <=>  ( The \'Spaceship\' Operator )Example:MORE:Since this operator reduces comparisons to an integer expression, it provides the most general purpose way to sort ascending or descending based on multiple columns/attributes. For example, if I have an array of objects I can do things like this:This basic pattern can be generalized to sort by any number of columns, in any permutation of ascending/descending on each.
