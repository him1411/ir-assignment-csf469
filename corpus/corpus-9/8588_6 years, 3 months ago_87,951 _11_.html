Is there any reliable way to get a Context from a Service?I want to register a broadcast receiver for ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED but I don\'t need my app to always get this information, so I don\'t put it in the Manifest. However, I can\'t have the broadcast receiver be killed by the GC when I need this information so I\'m registering the broadcast receiver in a Service. Hence, I need a Context to to call registerReceiver().\n When I no longer need the ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED I unregister it.Any tips?Service is a ContextService extends ContextWrapper which extends Context. Hence the Service is a Context.\nUse \'this\' keyword in the service.So.... (in Service or Activity Class)Since Service is a Context, the variable context must be this:YourServiceClass.this
