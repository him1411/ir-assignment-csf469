I\'m trying to download and save an image from the web using python\'s requests module.Here is the (working) code I used:Here is the new (non-working) code using requests:Can you help me on what attribute from the response to use from requests?You can either use the response.raw file object, or iterate over the response.To use the response.raw file-like object will not, by default, decode compressed responses (with GZIP or deflate). You can force it to decompress for you anyway by setting the decode_content attribute to True (requests sets it to False to control decoding itself). You can then use shutil.copyfileobj() to have Python stream the data to a file object:To iterate over the response use a loop; iterating like this ensures that data is decompressed by this stage:This\'ll read the data in 128 byte chunks; if you feel another chunk size works better, use the Response.iter_content() method with a custom chunk size:Note that you need to open the destination file in binary mode to ensure python doesn\'t try and translate newlines for you. We also set stream=True so that requests doesn\'t download the whole image into memory first.Get a file-like object from the request and copy it to a file. This will also avoid reading the whole thing into memory at once.I have the same need for downloading images using requests. I first tried the answer of Martijn Pieters, and it works well. But when I did a profile on this simple function, I found that it uses so many function calls compared to urllib and urllib2. I then tried the way recommended by the author of requests module: This much more reduced the number of function calls, thus speeded up my application.\nHere is the code of my profiler and the result.The result for testRequest:And the result for testRequest2:How about this, a quick solution.This might be easier than using requests. This is the only time I\'ll ever suggest not using requests to do HTTP stuff.Two liner using urllib:There is also a nice Python module named wget that is pretty easy to use. Found here.This demonstrates the simplicity of the design:Enjoy.Edit: You can also add an out parameter to specify a path.Following code snippet downloads a file.The file is saved with its filename as in specified url.There are 2 main ways:Using .content (simplest/official) (see Zhenyi Zhang\'s answer):Using .raw (see Martijn Pieters\'s answer):Timing both shows no noticeable difference.Here is a more user-friendly answer that still uses streaming. Just define these functions and call getImage(). It will use the same file name as the url and write to the current directory by default, but both can be changed.The request guts of getImage() are based on the answer here and the guts of getImageFast() are based on the answer above.I\'m going to post an answer as I don\'t have enough rep to make a comment, but with wget as posted by Blairg23, you can also provide an out parameter for the path.
