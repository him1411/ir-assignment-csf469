I\'m using Ruby 1.9.1 with Rails 2.3.4 My application is to handle text inputIf I try something like (the inside quotation marks look different)I get the following error:I need to user those quotation marks as users might input them and I have to account for that?Any ideas?Have you tried adding a magic comment in the script where you use non-ASCII chars? It should go on top of the script.It worked for me like a charm.If you want to add magic comments on all the source files of a project easily, you can use the magic_encoding gemthen just call magic_encoding in the terminal from the root of your app.I just want to add my solution:\nI use german umlauts like \xc3\xb6, \xc3\xbc, \xc3\xa4 and got the same error.\n@Jarek Zmudzinski just told you how it works, but here is mine:Add this code to the top of your Controller: # encoding: UTF-8\n(for example to use flash message with umlauts)example of my Controller:Now you can use \xc3\xb6, \xc3\xa4 ,\xc3\xbc, \xc3\x9f, "", etc.Just a note that as of Ruby 2.0 there is no need to add # encoding: utf-8. UTF-8 is automatically detected.Those slanted double quotes are not ASCII characters. The error message is misleading about them being \'multi-byte\'. That worked for me:
