Sometimes I want to edit a certain visual block of text across multiple lines.For example I would take a text that looks like this:And make it looke like thisCurrently the way I would do it now is...I don\'t need to indent if there is at least one column of whitespace before the words. I wouldn\'t need the whitespace if I didn\'t have to clear the visual block with c. But if I have to clear, then is there a way to do what I performed above without creating the needed whitespace with indentation?Also why does editing multiple lines at once only work by exiting out of insert mode with esc over ctrlc?Edit:Here is a more complicated exampletoin this example I would perform the vertical visual block over the ., then reinsert it back during insert mode, ie type .whatever.. Hopefully now you can see the drawback to this method. I am limited to only selecting a column of text that are all the same in a vertical position.An uppercase I must be used rather than a lowercase i because the lowercase i is interpreted as the start of a text object, which is rather useful on its own, e.g. for selecting a inside a tag block (it):Another approach is to use the . (dot) command in combination with I.I find this technique is often faster than the visual block mode for small numbers of additions and has the added benefit that if you don\'t need to insert the text on every single line in a range you can easily skip them by pressing extra j\'s.Note that for large number of contiguous additions, the block approach or macro will likely be superior.I would use a macro to record my actions, then repeat it.You now have a nice macro.Type 3@q to execute your macro 3 times to do the rest of the lines.or am I missing something?Press:Type the new text.Suppose you have this file:You want to add "vendor_" in front of "name", "comment", "phone", and "email", regardless of where they appear in the file.The c flag will prompt you for confirmation. You can drop that if you don\'t want the prompt.You might also have a use case where you want to delete a block of text and replace it.Like thisToYou can just visual block select "World" in both lines.Type c for change - Now you will be in insert mode.Insert the stuff you want and hit escape. Both get reflected vertically. It works just like \'I\' except that it replaces the block with the new text instead of inserting it.Updated January 2016Whilst the accepted answer is a great solution, this is actually slightly fewer keystrokes, and scales better - based in principle on the accepted answer.Note, this has fewer keystrokes than the accepted answer provided (compare Step 3). We just count the number of j actions to perform.If you have line numbers enabled (as illustrated above), and know the line number you wish to move to, then step 3 can be changed to #G where # is the wanted line number.In our example above, this would be 4G. However when dealing with just a few line numbers an explicit count works well.
