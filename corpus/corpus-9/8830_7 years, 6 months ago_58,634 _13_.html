What is the difference between \',\' and \'as\' in except statements, eg:and:Is the second syntax legal in 2.6?  It works in CPython 2.6 on Windows but the 2.5 interpreter in cygwin complains that it is invalid.If they are both valid in 2.6 which should I use?The definitive document is PEP-3110: Catching ExceptionsSummary:Yes it\'s legal. I\'m running Python 2.6Update: There is another reason to use the as syntax. Using , makes things a lot more ambiguous, as others have pointed out; and here\'s what makes the difference. As of Python 2.6, there is multicatch which allows you to catch multiple exceptions in one except block. In such a situation, it\'s more expressive and pythonic to sayrather than to saywhich would still workthe "as" syntax is the preferred one going forward, however if your code needs to work with older Python versions (2.6 is the first to support the new one) then you\'ll need to use the comma syntax.If you want to support all python versions you can use the sys.exc_info() function like this:(source:http://python3porting.com/noconv.html)
