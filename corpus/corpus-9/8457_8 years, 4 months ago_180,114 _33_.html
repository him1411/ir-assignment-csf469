I have two activities.  Main activity and child activity.\nWhen I press a button, the child activity is launched\nNow I have no problem. I want to send some data\nback to the main screen. I used The Bundle class\nbut it is not working. It throw some run time exception\nIs there any solution? Anyone knows the answer please\ntell me.There are a couple of ways to achieve what you want, depending on the circumstances. The most common scenario (which is what yours sounds like) is when a child Activity is used to get user input - such as choosing a contact from a list or entering data in a dialog box. In this case you should use startActivityForResult to launch your child Activity.This provides a pipeline for sending data back to the main Activity using setResult. The setResult method takes an int result value and an Intent that is passed back to the calling Activity.To access the returned data in the calling Activity override onActivityResult. The requestCode corresponds to the integer passed in in the startActivityForResult call, while the resultCode and data Intent are returned from the child Activity.Activity 1 uses startActivityForResult:Activity 2 is launched and you can perform the operation, to close the Activity do this:Activity 1 - returning from the previous activity will call onActivityResult:UPDATE:\nAnswer to Seenu69\'s comment, In activity two,Then in activity one,Call the child activity Intent using the startActivityForResult() method callThere is an example of this here:\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/notepad/notepad-ex2.htmland in the "Returning a Result from a Screen" of this:\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/faq/commontasks.html#opennewscreenIn First Activity uses startActivityForResult:On SecondActivity call setResult() on click events or on backPressed()It helps me to see things in context. Here is a complete simple project for sending data back. Rather than providing the xml layout files, here is an image.MainActivity.javaSecondActivity.javaI have created simple demo class for your better reference.FirstActivity.javaAnd here is SecondActivity.java,In first activity u can send intent using  startActivityForResultand()   and  then get result from  secound activity after it finished using setResult.MainActivity.class=========\nsecound activityUse sharedPreferences and save your data and access it from anywhere in the applicationsave date like thisAnd recieve data like thisThere are some ways of doing this.\n1. by using the startActivityForResult() which is very well explained in the above answers.by creating the static variables in your  "Utils" class or any other class of your own. For example i want to pass studentId from ActivityB to ActivityA.First my ActivityA is calling the ActivityB. Then inside ActivityB set the studentId (which is a static field in Utils.class).\nLike this Utils.STUDENT_ID="1234"; then while comming back to the ActivityA use the studentId which is stored in Utils.STUDENT_ID.by creating a getter and setter method in your Application Class.like this: so you are done . just set the data inside when u are in ActivityB and after comming back to ActivityA , get the data.
