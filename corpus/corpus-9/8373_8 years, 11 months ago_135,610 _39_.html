Could somebody give me a brief overview of the differences between HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1?  I\'ve spent some time with both of the RFCs, but haven\'t been able to pull out a lot of difference between them.  Wikipedia says this:HTTP/1.1 (1997-1999)Current version; persistent connections enabled by default and works well with proxies. Also supports request pipelining, allowing multiple requests to be sent at the same time, allowing the server to prepare for the workload and potentially transfer the requested resources more quickly to the client.But that doesn\'t mean a lot to me.  I realize this is a somewhat complicated subject, so I\'m not expecting a full answer, but can someone give me a brief overview of the differences at a bit lower level?\nBy this I mean that I\'m looking for the info I would need to know to implement either an HTTP server or application. I\'m mostly looking for a nudge in the right direction so that I can figure it out on my own.  Proxy support and the Host field:HTTP 1.1 has a required Host header by spec.HTTP 1.0 does not officially require a Host header, but it doesn\'t hurt to add one, and many applications (proxies) expect to see the Host header regardless of the protocol version.Example:This header is useful because it allows you to route a message through proxy servers, and also because your web server can distinguish between different sites on the same server.So this means if you have blahblahlbah.com and helohelohelo.com both pointing to the same IP.  Your web server can use the Host field to distinguish which site the client machine wants. Persistent connections:HTTP 1.1 also allows you to have persistent connections which means that you can have more than one request/response on the same HTTP connection. In HTTP 1.0 you had to open a new connection for each request/response pair.  And after each response the connection would be closed.   This lead to some big efficiency problems because of TCP Slow Start.OPTIONS method:HTTP/1.1 introduces the OPTIONS method.  An HTTP client can use this method to determine the abilities of the HTTP server.  It\'s mostly used for Cross Origin Resource Sharing in web applications.Caching:HTTP 1.0 had support for caching via the header: If-Modified-Since.HTTP 1.1 expands on the caching support a lot by using something called \'entity tag\'. \nIf 2 resources are the same, then they will have the same entity tags. HTTP 1.1 also adds the If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match, If-None-Match conditional headers. There are also further additions relating to caching like the Cache-Control header. 100 Continue status:There is a new return code in HTTP/1.1 100 Continue.  This is to prevent a client from sending a large request when that client is not even sure if the server can process the request, or is authorized to process the request.  In this case the client sends only the headers, and the server will tell the client 100 Continue, go ahead with the body. Much more:RFC 2616, Section 19.6.1: "Changes from HTTP/1.0"For trivial applications (e.g. sporadically retrieving a temperature value from a web-enabled thermometer) HTTP 1.0 is fine for both a client and a server.  You can write a bare-bones socket-based HTTP 1.0 client or server in about 20 lines of code.For more complicated scenarios HTTP 1.1 is the way to go.  Expect a 3 to 5-fold increase in code size for dealing with the intricacies of the more complex HTTP 1.1 protocol.  The complexity mainly comes, because in HTTP 1.1 you will need to create, parse, and respond to various headers.  You can shield your application from this complexity by having a client use an HTTP library, or server use a web application server.One of the first differences that I can recall from top of my head are multiple domains running in the same server, partial resource retrieval, this allows you to retrieve and speed up the download of a resource (it\'s what almost every download accelerator does).If you want to develop an application like a website or similar, you don\'t need to worry too much about the differences but you should know the difference between GET and POST verbs at least.Now if you want to develop a browser then yes, you will have to know the complete protocol as well as if you are trying to develop a HTTP server.If you are only interested in knowing the HTTP protocol I would recommend you starting with HTTP/1.1 instead of 1.0.A key compatibility issue is support for persistent connections.  I recently worked on a server that "supported" HTTP/1.1, yet failed to close the connection when a client sent an HTTP/1.0 request.  When writing a server that supports HTTP/1.1, be sure it also works well with HTTP/1.0-only clients.\xef\x81\xae HTTP 1.0 (1994)\xef\x81\xae HTTP 1.1 (1996- 2015)HTTP 1.1 is an enhancement of HTTP 1.0. The following lists the\nfour major improvements:Efficient use of IP addresses, by allowing multiple domains to be\nserved from a single IP address.Faster response, by allowing a web browser to send multiple\nrequests over a single persistent connection.Compared to 1.0, 1.1 reduces web trafficHTTP 1.1 is the latest version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the World Wide Web application protocol that runs on top of the Internet\'s TCP/IP suite of protocols. compare to HTTP 1.0 , HTTP 1.1 provides faster delivery of Web pages than the original HTTP and reduces Web traffic.Web traffic Example: For example, if you are accessing a server. At the same time so many users are accessing the server for the data, Then there is a chance for hanging the Server. This is Web traffic.
