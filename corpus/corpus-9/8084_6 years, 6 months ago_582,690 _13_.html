If I select a cell containing a formula, I know I can drag the little box in the right-hand corner downwards to apply the formula to more cells of the column. Unfortunately, I need to do this for 300,000 rows!Is there a shortcut, similar to CTRL+SPACE, that will apply a formula to the entire column, or to a selected part of the column?Try double-clicking on the bottom right hand corner of the cell (ie on the box that you would otherwise drag).If the formula already exists in a cell you can fill it down as follows:On Mac, use CMD instead of CTRL.An alternative if the formula is in the first cell of a column:Select a range of cells (the entire column in this case), type in your formula, and hold down Ctrl while you press Enter. This places the formula in all selected cells.Double clicking the bottom right hand corner in a column empty below that point will only copy down as far as the last occupied cell of the continuous series of occupied cells of which the cell on the left is part* in the column immediately to the left (something that might not be noticed immediately if say the adjacent column entries stopped at 299,000). Selecting the entire column holding Ctrl and pressing enter will significantly and needlessly increase the size of the spreadsheet (and slow down processing) where the formula is only required for 300,000 rows. It will also overwrite any header for that column.  For bulk copying \'under control\', I suggest some modification to the other answers to avoid minor potential issues (or perhaps significant if, for example, wishing to email the result as an attachment): Home > Editing - Find & Select > Go To, enter reference for the cell with highest number row to be populated in the relevant column under Reference: and OK. Enter something there (z would do) then return to the cell with the formula (need not be in Row1) and copy that, select cell immediately below it, Ctrl+Shift+Down and paste.  (Or use keyboard short cuts to suit.)  Incidentally, the little box in the right-hand corner is called fill handle:  * rather a clumsy description. Put another way, the copying down does not continue across the first empty cell encountered in the column immediately to the left. It stops in the row above the first such empty cell.
