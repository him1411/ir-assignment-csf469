How do you make a UINavigationBar transparent? Though I want its bar items to remain visible.If anybody is wondering how to achieve this in iOS 7+, here\'s a solution (iOS 6 compatible too)In Objective-CIn swift 3 (iOS 10)In swift 2Setting translucent to YES on the navigation bar does the trick, due to a behavior discussed in the UINavigationBar documentation. I\'ll report here the relevant fragment:If you set this property to YES on a navigation bar with an opaque custom background image, the navigation bar will apply a system opacity less than 1.0 to the image.In iOS5 you can do this to make the navigation bar transparent:From IOS7 :For anyone who wants to do this in Swift 2.x:or Swift 3.x:This seems to work:I know this topic is old, but if people want to know how its done without overloading the drawRect method.This is what you need:After doing what everyone else said above, i.e.:... my navigation bar was still white. So I added this line:... et voila! That seemed to do the trick. Try the following piece of code:The below code expands upon the top answer chosen for this thread, to get rid of the bottom border and set text color:The last two coded lines of this code set transparency. I borrowed that code from this thread and it worked perfectly!The "clipsToBounds" property was code I found which got rid of the bottom border line with OR without transparency set (so if you decide to go with a solid white/black/etc. background instead, there will still be no border line).The "tintColor" line (2nd coded line) set my back button to a light greyI kept barTintColor as a backup. I don\'t know why transparency would not work, but if it doesn\'t, I want my bg white as I used to have itfor Swift 3.0:Do you mean entirely transparent, or using the translucent-black style seen in the Photos app? The latter you can accomplish by setting its barStyle property to UIBarStyleBlackTranslucent. The former... I\'m not sure about. If you want the items on it to still be visible, you might have to do some digging around in the bar\'s view hierarchy and remove the view containing its background.Another Way That worked for me is to Subclass UINavigationBar And leave the drawRect Method empty !!This works for Swift 2.0.
