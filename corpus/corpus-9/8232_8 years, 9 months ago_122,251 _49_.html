I\'m looking for a library in Python which will provide at and cron like functionality.I\'d quite like have a pure Python solution, rather than relying on tools installed on the box; this way I run on machines with no cron.For those unfamiliar with cron: you can schedule tasks based upon an expression like: The cron time expression syntax is less important, but I would like to have something with this sort of flexibility. If there isn\'t something that does this for me out-the-box, any suggestions for the building blocks to make something like this would be gratefully received.Edit\nI\'m not interested in launching processes, just "jobs" also written in Python - python functions. By necessity I think this would be a different thread, but not in a different process.To this end, I\'m looking for the expressivity of the cron time expression, but in Python. Cron has been around for years, but I\'m trying to be as portable as possible. I cannot rely on its presence.If you\'re looking for something lightweight checkout schedule:Disclosure: I\'m the author of that library.You could just use normal Python argument passing syntax to specify your crontab.  For example, suppose we define an Event class as below:(Note: Not thoroughly tested)Then your CronTab can be specified in normal python syntax as:This way you get the full power of Python\'s argument mechanics (mixing positional and keyword args, and can use symbolic names for names of weeks and months)The CronTab class would be defined as simply sleeping in minute increments, and calling check() on each event.  (There are probably some subtleties with daylight savings time / timezones to be wary of though).  Here\'s a quick implementation:A few things to note:  Python\'s weekdays / months are zero indexed (unlike cron), and that range excludes the last element, hence syntax like "1-5" becomes range(0,5) - ie [0,1,2,3,4].  If you prefer cron syntax, parsing it shouldn\'t be too difficult however.maybe this has come up only after the question was asked; I thought I just mention it for completeness sake: https://apscheduler.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Check out Celery, they have periodic tasks like cron."... Crontab module for read and writing crontab files and accessing the system cron automatically and simply using a direct API. ..."http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-crontaband also APScheduler, a python package. Already written & debugged.http://packages.python.org/APScheduler/cronschedule.htmlOne thing that in my searches I\'ve seen is python\'s sched module which might be the kind of thing you\'re looking for.TurboGears ships with scheduled task capability based on KronosI\'ve never used Kronos directly, but the scheduling in TG has a decent set of features and is solid.More or less same as above but concurrent using gevent :)I have modified the script.Easy to use:Try to start task in the first second of a minute.Code on GithubI have a minor fix for the CronTab class run method suggested by Brian.The timing was out by one second leading to a one-second, hard loop at the end of each minute.Check out luigi (https://github.com/spotify/luigi). It\'s written in python and has a nice web UI for monitoring tasks. It also has a dependency graph. Might be overkill for what you need but it will probably do the trick.None of the listed solutions even attempt to parse a complex cron schedule string. So, here is my version, using croniter. Basic gist:Helper routines:There isn\'t a "pure python" way to do this because some other process would have to launch python in order to run your solution.  Every platform will have one or twenty different ways to launch processes and monitor their progress.  On unix platforms, cron is the old standard.  On Mac OS X there is also launchd, which combines cron-like launching with watchdog functionality that can keep your process alive if that\'s what you want. Once python is running, then you can use the sched module to schedule tasks.Just in case, if you are using windows, there exists a pycron. Check out http://sourceforge.net/projects/pycron/ .\nFor linux,I will go by either cron or sched.Another trivial solution would be:And the class aqcron.At is:I don\'t know if something like that already exists. It would be easy to write your own with time, datetime and/or calendar modules, see http://docs.python.org/library/time.htmlThe only concern for a python solution is that your job needs to be always running and possibly be automatically "resurrected" after a reboot, something for which you do need to rely on system dependent solutions. Brian\'s solution is working quite well. However, as others have pointed out, there is a subtle bug in the run code. Also i found it overly complicated for the needs.Here is my simpler and functional alternative for the run code in case anybody needs it:I took Brian\'s solution, made a few changes, added the beginnings of a standard crontab file parser, and put it at https://bitbucket.org/dbenamy/devcron.You can check out PiCloud\'s [1] Crons [2], but do note that your jobs won\'t be running on your own machine. It\'s also a service that you\'ll need to pay for if you use more than 20 hours of compute time a month.[1] http://www.picloud.com[2] http://docs.picloud.com/cron.htmlJython? I just searched here and found that this word has not been mentioned on this page.  Real multithreading (not multi-process), Futures, ExecutorService, and all the other tools in the concurrency toolbox, etc.
