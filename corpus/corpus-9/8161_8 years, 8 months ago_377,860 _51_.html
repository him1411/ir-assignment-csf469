How do you format correctly according to the device configuration a date and time when having year, month, day, hour and minute?Use the standard Java DateFormat class.For example to display the current date and time do the following:You can initialise a Date object with your own values, however you should be aware that the constructors have been deprecated and you should really be using a Java Calendar object.In my opinion, android.text.format.DateFormat.getDateFormat(context) makes me confused because this method returns java.text.DateFormat rather than android.text.format.DateFormat - -".So, I use the fragment code as below to get the current date/time in my format.In addition, you can use others formats. Follow DateFormat.Date to Locale date string:Options:- > Dec 31, 1969-> Dec 31, 1969 4:00:00 PM-> 4:00:00 PMThis will do it: Use SimpleDateFormatLike this:Following this: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/format/Time.htmlIs better to use Android native Time class:Then format:This is my method, you can define and input and output format.Use build in Time class!I use SimpleDateFormat without custom pattern to get actual date and time from the system in the device\'s preselected format:returns:Use these two as a class variables:And use it like this:This code would return the current date and time:Try:And when you are accessing passed variables:I use it like this:The other answers are generally correct. I should like to contribute the modern answer. The classes Date, DateFormat and SimpleDateFormat used in most of the other answers, are long outdated and have caused trouble for many programmers over many years. Today we have so much better in java.time, AKA JSR-310, the modern Java date & time API. Can you use this on Android yet? Most certainly! The modern classes have been backported to Android in the ThreeTenABP project. See this question: How to use ThreeTenABP in Android Project for all the details.This snippet should get you started:When I set my computer\xe2\x80\x99s preferred language to US English or UK English, this prints:When instead I set it to Danish, I get:So it does follow the configuration. I am unsure exactly to what detail it follows your device\xe2\x80\x99s date and time settings, though, and this may vary from phone to phone.The Java.util.Date and .Calendar and SimpleDateFormat in Java (and Android) are notoriously troublesome. Avoid them. They are so bad that Sun/Oracle gave up on them, supplanting them with the new java.time package in Java 8 (not in Android as of 2014). The new java.time was inspired by the Joda-Time library.Joda-Time does work in Android.Search StackOverflow for "Joda" to find many examples and much discussion.A tidbit of source code using Joda-Time 2.4.Standard format.Localized format.Back to 2016, When I want to customize the format (not according to the device configuration, as you ask...) I usually use the string resource file:in strings.xml:In Activity:This is also useful with the release of the new Date Binding Library.So I can have something like this in layout file:And in java class:The android Time class provides 3 formatting methods http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/format/Time.htmlThis is how I did it:I hope thats helpful :-)It\'s too late but it may help to someonehere format is what format you needex: "HH:mm" returns 15:30
