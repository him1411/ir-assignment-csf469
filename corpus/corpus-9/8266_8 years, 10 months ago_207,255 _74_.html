I\'m brand new to jQuery and have some experience using Prototype. In Prototype, there is a method to "flash" an element â€” ie. briefly highlight it in another color and have it fade back to normal so that the user\'s eye is drawn to it. Is there such a method in jQuery? I see fadeIn, fadeOut, and animate, but I don\'t see anything like "flash". Perhaps one of these three can be used with appropriate inputs?My way is .fadein, .fadeout .fadein, .fadeout ......You can use the jQuery Color plugin.For example, to draw attention to all the divs on your page, you could use the following code:Edit - New and improvedThe following uses the same technique as above, but it has the added benefits of:Extend the jQuery Object:Usage example:You can use css3 animations to flash an element And you jQuery to add the classThis one "pulses" it to the color you want (e.g. white) by putting a div background color behind it, and then fading the object out and in again.HTML object (e.g. button):jQuery (vanilla, no other plugins):element - class namefirst number in fadeTo() - milliseconds for the transitionsecond number in fadeTo() - opacity of the object after fade/unfadeYou may check this out in the lower right corner of this webpage: https://www.majalmirasol.com/v1/Edit (willsteel) no duplicated selector by using $(this) and tweaked values to acutally perform a flash (as the OP requested).You could use the highlight effect in jQuery UI to achieve the same, I guess.If you\'re using jQueryUI, there is pulsate function in UI/Effectshttp://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/PulsateYou could use this plugin (put it in a js file and use it via script-tag)http://plugins.jquery.com/project/colorAnd then use something like this:This adds a \'flash\' method to all jQuery objects:You can extend Desheng Li\'s method further by allowing an iterations count to do multiple flashes like so:Then you can call the method with a time and number of flashes:(no jquery-ui/animate/color needed.)If all you want is that yellow "flash" effect without loading jquery color:Above script simply does 1s yellow fadeout, perfect for letting the user know the element was was updated or something similar.Usage:This may be a more up-to-date answer, and is shorter, as things have been consolidated somewhat since this post.  Requires jquery-ui-effect-highlight.http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/HighlightI can\'t believe this isn\'t on this question yet. All you gotta do: This does exactly what you want it to do, is super easy, works for both show() and hide() methods. Would a pulse effect(offline) JQuery plugin be appropriate for what you are looking for ?You can add a duration for limiting the pulse effect in time.As mentioned by J-P in the comments, there is now his updated pulse plugin.\nSee his GitHub repo. And here is a demo.How about a really simple answer?$(\'selector\').fadeTo(\'fast\',0).fadeTo(\'fast\',1).fadeTo(\'fast\',0).fadeTo(\'fast\',1)Blinks twice...that\'s all folks!The following codes work for me. Define two fade-in and fade-out functions and put them in each other\'s callback.The following controls the times of flashes:Found this many moons later but if anyone cares, it seems like this is a nice way to get something to flash permanently:I was looking for a solution to this problem but without relying on jQuery UI.  This is what I came up with and it works for me (no plugins, just Javascript and jQuery);\n-- Heres the working fiddle -- http://jsfiddle.net/CriddleCraddle/yYcaY/2/ Set the current CSS parameter in your CSS file as normal css, and create a new class that just handles the parameter to change i.e. background-color, and set it to \'!important\' to override the default behavior. like this...Then just use the function below and pass in the DOM element as a string, an integer for the number of times you would want the flash to occur, the class you want to change to, and an integer for delay.Note: If you pass in an even number for the \'times\' variable, you will end up with the class you started with, and if you pass an odd number you will end up with the toggled class. Both are useful for different things.  I use the \'i\' to change the delay time, or they would all fire at the same time and the effect would be lost.  Like fadein / fadeout you could use animate css / delaySimple and flexibleThere is a workaround for the animate background bug.  This gist includes an example of a simple highlight method and its use.https://gist.github.com/1068231If including a library is overkill here is a solution that is guaranteed to work.Inside second setTimeout reset default background colorTested in a few browsers and it works nicely.Unfortunately the top answer requires JQuery UI. http://api.jquery.com/animate/http://jsfiddle.net/EfKBg/Here\'s a slightly improved version of colbeerhey\'s solution.  I added a return statement so that, in true jQuery form, we chain events after calling the animation. I\'ve also added the arguments to clear the queue and jump to the end of an animation.  This one will pulsate an element\'s background color until a mouseover event is triggeredPut this together from all of the above - an easy solution for flashing an element and return to the original bgcolour...Use like this:Hope this helps!just give elem.fadeOut(10).fadeIn(10);3000 is 3 secondsFrom opacity 1 it is faded to 0.3, then to 1 and so on.You can stack more of these. Only jQuery is needed. :)I am using this one. though not yet tested on all browser. \njust modify this in the way you like,usage: hlight($("#mydiv"));NOTE: you need a jquery UI added to your header.This function makes it blink.\nIt must use cssHooks, because of the rgb default return of background-color function.Hope it helps!Simple as the best is to do in this way :
