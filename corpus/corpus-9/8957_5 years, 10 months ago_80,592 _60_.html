I noticed that and both works fine - actually the previous one is converted to lowercase.I think that this makes sense for the user.If I look at Google then this URL works fine:but this one with "ABOUT" is not working:  Should the URL be case sensitive?According to W3\'s "HTML and URLs" they should: There may be URLs, or parts of URLs, where case doesn\'t matter, but\n  identifying these may not be easy. Users should always consider that\n  URLs are case-sensitive.All “insensitive”s are boldened for readability.Domain names are case insensitive according to RFC 4343. The rest of URL is sent to the server via the GET method. This may be case sensitive or not.Take this page for example, stackoverflow.com recieves GET string /questions/7996919/should-url-be-case-sensitive, sending a HTML document to your browser. Stackoverflow.com is case insensitive because it produces the same result for /QUEStions/7996919/Should-url-be-case-sensitive.On the other hand, Wikipedia is case sensitive except the first character of the title. The URLs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/case_sensitivity leads to the same article, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASE_SENSITIVITY returns 404.Depends on the hosting os. Sites that are hosted on Windows tend to be case insensitive as the underlying file system is case insensitive. Sites hosted on Unix type systems tend to be case sensitive as their underlying file systems are typically case sensitive. The host name part of the URL is always case insensitive, it\'s the rest of the path that varies.The domain name portion of a URL is not case sensitive since DNS ignores case:\nhttp://en.example.org/ and HTTP://EN.EXAMPLE.ORG/ both open the same page.The path is used to specify and perhaps find the resource requested. It is case-sensitive, though it may be treated as case-insensitive by some servers, especially those based on Microsoft Windows.If the server is case sensitive and http://en.example.org/wiki/URL is correct, then http://en.example.org/WIKI/URL or http://en.example.org/wiki/url will display an HTTP 404 error page, unless these URLs point to valid resources themselves.I am not a fan of bumping old articles but because this was one of the first responses for this particular issue I felt a need to clarify something.As @Bhavin Shah answer states the domain part of the url is case insensitive, so and and are all the same but everything after the domain name part is considered case sensitive. so...andare different.Note: I am talking "technically" and not "literally" in a lot of cases, most actually, servers are setup to handle these items the same, but it is possible to set them up so they are NOT handled the same.Different servers handle this differently and in some cases they Have to be case sensitive.  In many cases query string values are encoded (such as Session Ids or Base64 encoded data thats passed as a query string value)  These items are case sensitive by their nature so the server has to be case sensitive in handling them.So to answer the question, "should" servers be case sensitive in grabbing this data, the answer is "yes, most definitely."Of course not everything needs to be case sensitive but the server should be aware of what that is and how to handle those cases.@Hart Simha\'s comment basically says the same thing. I missed it before I posted so I want to give credit where credit is due.Look at the specification here: \nsection 2.7.3\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-25#page-19The scheme and host    are case-insensitive and normally provided in lowercase; all other    components are compared in a case-sensitive\n  manner.URLs should be case insensitive unless there is a good reason why they are should not be. This is not mandatory (it is not any part of an RFC) but it makes the communication and storage of URLs far more reliable. If I have two pages on a website:andHow should they differ?  Maybe one is written \'shouting style\' (caps) - but from an IA point of view, the distinction should never be made by a change in the case of the URL.Moreover, it is easy to implement this in Apache - just use CheckSpelling On from mod_Speling. Old question but I stumbled here so why not take a shot at it since the question is seeking various perspective and not a definitive answer.w3c may have its recommendations - which I care a lot - but want to rethink since the question is here.Why does w3c consider domain names be case insensitive and leaves anything afterwards case insensitive ? I am thinking that the rationale is that the domain part of the URL is hand typed by a user. \nEverything after being hyper text will be resolved by the machine (browser and server in the back).Machines can handle case insensitivity better than humans (not the technical kind:)).But the question is just because the machines CAN handle that should it be done that way ?I mean what are the benefits of naming and accessing a resource sitting at hereIsTheResource vs hereistheresource ?The lateral is very unreadable than the camel case one which is more readable. \nReadable to Humans (including the technical kind.)So here are my points:-Resource Path falls in the somewhere in the middle of programming structure and being close to an end user behind the browser sometimes.Your URL (excluding the domain name) should be case insensitive if your users are expected to touch it or type it etc. You should develop your application to AVOID having users type the path as much as possible. Your URL (excluding the domain name) should be case sensitive if your users would never type it by hand. ConclusionPath should be case sensitive. My points are weighing towards the case sensitive paths. URL characters are converted into hex code (if you\'ve ever noticed spaces in URLs being displayed as %20, etc.), and since lower and upper case have different hex values, it makes perfect sense that URLs are most definitely case sensitive.  However the spirit of the question seems to be SHOULD that be the standard and I say no, but they are.  Its up to the developer/provider to account for this in their code if they want it to work regardless for an end user.I think this and many of the answers around what the spec does or does not say is missing the point of the question.Should they be case sensitive? That\'s a loaded question really. From a user\'s point of view, case sensitivity is a pain point, not all know makes a difference. The question of whether URIs should or shouldn\'t be, depends on the context of the question. For technical flexibility, yes, they should be. For usability, no, they should not be.the question is should the url be case sensitive?I see no use, or good practice behind case sensitive URL\'s. It stupid, it sucks and should be avoided at all times.Just to back up my opinion, when someone asks what URL, how could you explain what characters of the URL are Upper or Lower case? That\'s nonsense and should no one ever tell you otherwise. For websites hosted in a Linux server, URL is case sensitive. \nhttp://www.google.com/about and http://www.google.com/About will be redirected to different locations. While in a Windows Server, URL is case-insensitive, as in naming a FOLDER and will be redirected to same location.It is possible to make noncase sensitive URLsMaking Google.com..GOOGLE.com etc direct to google.com
