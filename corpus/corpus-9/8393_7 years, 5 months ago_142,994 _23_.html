I have an array of hashes like followingI am trying to sort above array in descending order according to the value of :bar in each hash.I am using sort_by like following to sort above array.However above sorts the array in ascending order. How do I make it sort in descending order?One solution was to do following:But that negative sign does not seem appropriate. Any views?It\'s always enlightening to do a benchmark on the various suggested answers. Here\'s what I found out:I think it\'s interesting that @Pablo\'s sort_by{...}.reverse! is fastest. Before running the test I thought it would be slower than "-a[:bar]" but negating the value turns out to take longer than it does to reverse the entire array in one pass. It\'s not much of a difference, but every little speed-up helps.Please note that these results are different in Ruby 1.9Here are results for Ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-darwin10.8.0]:These are on an old MacBook Pro. Newer, or faster machines, will have lower values, but the relative differences will remain.Here\'s a bit updated version on newer hardware and the 2.1.1 version of Ruby:New results running the above code using Ruby 2.2.1 on a more recent Macbook Pro. Again, the exact numbers aren\'t important, it\'s their relationships:New Results running the above code using Ruby 2.4.0 on MacBook Pro:Just a quick thing, that denotes the intent of descending order.(Will think of a better way in the mean time) ;)You could do:What about: It works!!Regarding the benchmark suite mentioned... these results also hold for sorted arrays.\nsort_by / reverse it is :)Eg: And the results:a.sort_by { |h| h[:bar] }.reverse
