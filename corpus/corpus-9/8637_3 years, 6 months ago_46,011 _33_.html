I was wondering what the difference between App Engine & Compute Engine are. Can anyone explain the difference to me?App Engine is a Platform-as-a-Service. It means that you simply deploy your code, and the platform does everything else for you. For example, if you app becomes very successful, App Engine will automatically create more instances to handle the increased volume.Read more about App EngineCompute Engine is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service. You have to create and configure your own virtual machine instances. It gives you more flexibility and generally costs much less than App Engine. The drawback is that you have to manage your app and virtual machines yourself.Read more about Compute EngineYou can mix both App Engine and Compute Engine, if necessary. They both work well with the other parts of the Google Cloud Platform.EDIT (May 2016):One more important distinction: projects running on App Engine can scale down to zero instances if no requests are coming in. This is extremely useful at the development stage as you can go for weeks without going over the generous free quota of instance-hours. Flexible runtime (i.e. "managed VMs") require at least one instance to run constantly.EDIT (April 2017):Cloud Functions (currently in beta) is the next level up from App Engine in terms of abstraction - no instances! It allows developers to deploy bite-size pieces of code that execute in response to different events, which may include HTTP requests, changes in Cloud Storage, etc.The biggest difference with App Engine is that functions are priced per 100 milliseconds, while App Engine\'s instances shut down only after 15 minutes of inactivity. Another advantage is that Cloud Functions execute immediately, while a call to App Engine may require a new instance - and cold-starting a new instance may take a few seconds or longer (depending on runtime and your code).This makes Cloud Functions ideal for (a) rare calls - no need to keep an instance live just in case something happens, (b) rapidly changing loads where instances are often spinning and shutting down, and possibly more use cases.Read more about Cloud FunctionsBasic difference is that Google App Engine (GAE) is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) whereas Google Compute Engine (GCE) is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). To run your application in GAE you just need to write your code and deploy it into GAE, no other headache. Since GAE is fully scalable, it will automatically acquire more instances in case the traffic goes higher and decrease the instances when traffic decreases. You will be charged for the resources you really use, I mean, you will be billed for the Instance-Hours, Transferred Data, Storage etc your app really used. But the restriction is, you can create your application in only Python, PHP, Java and Go.On the other hand, GCE provides you full infrastructure in the form of Virtual Machine. You have complete control over those VMs\' environment and runtime as you can write or install any program there. Actually GCE is the way to use Google Data Centers virtually. In GCE you have to manually configure your infrastructure to handle scalability by using Load Balancer. Both GAE and GCE are part of Google Cloud Platform.Update: In March 2014 Google announced a new service under App Engine named Managed Virtual Machine. Managed VMs offers app engine applications a bit more flexibility over app platform, CPU and memory options. Like GCE you can create a custom runtime environment in these VMs for app engine application. Actually Managed VMs of App Engine blurs the frontier between IAAS and PAAS to some extent. To put it simply: compute engine gives you a server which you have full control/responsibility for. You have direct access to the operating system, and you install all the software that you want, which is usually a web server, database, etc...In app engine you don\'t manage the operating system of any of the underlying software. You only upload code (Java, PHP, Python, or Go) and voila - it just runs... App engine saves tons of headache, especially for inexperienced people but it has 2 significant drawbacks:\n1. more expensive (but it does have a free quota which compute engine doesn\'t)\n2. you have less control, thus certain things are just not possible, or only possible in one specific way (for example saving and writing files). App Engine gives developers the ability to control Google Compute Engine cores, as well as provide a web-facing front end for Google Compute Engine data processing applications.On the other hand, Compute Engine offers direct and complete operating system management of your virtual machines. To present your App, you\'re going to need resources, and Google Cloud Storage is ideal for storing your assets and data, whatever they\'re used for. You get fast data access with hosting around the globe. Reliability is guaranteed at a 99.95% up-time, and Google also provides the ability to back up and restore your data, and believe it or not, storage is unlimited.You can manage your assets with Google Cloud Storage, storing, retrieving, displaying, and deleting them. You can also quickly read and write to flat datasheets that are kept in Cloud Storage. Next in the Google Cloud lineup is BigQuery. With BigQuery, you can analyze massive amounts of data, we\'re talking millions of records, within seconds. Access is handled via a straightforward UI, or a Representational State Transfer, or REST interface.Data storage is, as you might suspect, not a problem, and scales to hundreds of TB. BigQuery is accessible via a host of client libraries, including those for Java, .NET, Python, Go, Ruby, PHP, and Javascript. A SQL-like syntax called NoSQL is available which can be accessed through these client libraries, or through a web user interface. Finally, let\'s talk about the Google Cloud platform database options, Cloud SQL and Cloud Datastore.There is a major difference. Cloud SQL is for relational databases, primarily MySQL, whereas Cloud Datastore is for non-relational databases using noSQL. With Cloud SQL, you have the choice of either hosting in the US, Europe, or Asia, with 100 GB of storage, and 16 GB of RAM per database instance.Cloud Datastore is available at no charge for up to 50 K read/write instructions per month and 1 GB of data stored also per month. There is a fee if you exceed these quotas, however. App Engine can also work with other lesser known, more targeted members of the Google Cloud platform, including the Cloud Endpoints for creating API backends, Google Prediction API for data analysis and trend forecasting, or the Google Translate API, for multilingual output.While you can do a fair amount with App Engine on its own, It\'s potential skyrockets when you factor in its ability to work easily and efficiently with its fellow Google Cloud platform services.Or to make it even simpler (since at times we fail to differentiate between GAE Standard and GAE Flex):Compute Engine is analogous to a virtual PC, where you\'d deploy a small website + database, for instance. You manage everything, including control of installed disk drives. If you deploy a website, you\'re in charge of setting up DNS etc.Google App Engine (Standard) is like a read-only sandboxed folder where you upload code to execute from and don\'t worry about the rest (yes: read-only). DNS / Sub-domains etc is so much easier to map.Google App Engine (Flexible) is in fact like a whole file-system (not just a locked down folder), where you have more power than the Standard engine, e.g. you have read/write permissions, (but less compared to a Compute Engine). In GAE standard you have a fixed set of libraries installed for you and you cannot deploy 3rd party libraries at will. In the Flexible environment you can install whatever library your app depends on, including custom build environments (such as Python 3).Although GAE Standard is very cumbersome to deal with (although Google makes it sound simple), it scales really well when put under pressure. It\'s cumbersome because you need to test and ensure compatibility with the locked-down environment and ensure any 3rd party library you use does not use any other 3rd party library you\'re unaware of which may not work on GAE standard. It takes longer to set it up in practice but can be more rewarding in the longer run for simple deployments.
