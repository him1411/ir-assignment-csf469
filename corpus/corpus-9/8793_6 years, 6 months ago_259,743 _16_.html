I have a list of elements:And styled like this:Outputs One | Two | Three | Four | Five | instead of One | Two | Three | Four | FiveAnyone know how to CSS select all but the last element?You can see the definition of the :not() selector hereIf it\'s a problem with the not selector, you can set all of them and override the last oneor if you can use before, no need for last-childEvery things seems correct. You might want to use the following css selector instead of what you used.Your example as written works perfectly in Chrome 11 for me. Perhaps your browser just doesn\'t support the :not() selector?You may need to use JavaScript or similar to accomplish this cross-browser. jQuery implements :not() in its selector API.Your sample does not work in IE for me, you have to specify Doctype header in your document to render your page in standard way in IE to use the content CSS property:Second way is to use CSS 3 selectorsBut you still need to specify DoctypeAnd third way is to use JQuery with some script like following:Advantage of third way is that you dont have to specify doctype and jQuery will take care of compatibility.An example using CSS
