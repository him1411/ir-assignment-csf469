For some reason neither the accepted answer nor any others work for me for "Sending email in .NET through Gmail". Why would they not work?UPDATE: I have tried all the answers (accepted and otherwise) in the other question, but none of them work.I would just like to know if it works for anyone else, otherwise Google may have changed something (which has happened before).When I try the piece of code that uses SmtpDeliveryMethod.Network, I quickly receive an SmtpException on Send(message). The message is The SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client was not authenticated. The server response was: 5.5.1 Authentication Required. Learn more at" <-- seriously, it ends there.UPDATE:This is a question that I asked a long time ago, and the accepted answer is code that I\'ve used many, many times on different projects.I\'ve taken some of the ideas in this post and other EmailSender projects to create an EmailSender project at Codeplex. It\'s designed for testability and supports my favourite SMTP services such as GoDaddy and Gmail. CVertex, make sure to review your code, and, if that doesn\'t reveal anything, post it. I was just enabling this on a test ASP.NET site I was working on, and it works. Actually, at some point I had an issue on my code. I didn\'t spot it until I had a simpler version on a console program and saw it was working (no change on the Gmail side as you were worried about). The below code works just like the samples you referred to:I also got it working using a combination of web.config, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w355a94k.aspx and code (because there is no matching EnableSsl in the configuration file :( ).THE FOLLOWING WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IF ALL ELSE HAS FAILED:I got the exact same error, it turns out Google\'s new password strengh measuring algorithm has changed deeming my current password as too weak, and not telling me a thing about it (not even a message or warning)... How did I discover this? Well, I chose to change my password to see if it would help (tried everything else to no avail) and when I changed my password, it worked!Then, for an experiment, I tried changing my password back to my previous password to see what would happen, and Gmail didn\'t actually allow me to do this, citing the reason "sorry we cannot allow you to save this change as your chosen password is too weak" and wouldn\'t let me go back to my old password. I figured from this that it was erroring out because either a) you need to change your password once every x amount of months or b). as I said before, their password strength algorithms changed and therefore the weak password i had was not accepted, even though they did not say anything about this when trying to login ANYWHERE! This (number 2) is the most likely scenario, as my weak password was about 4 months old, and it let me use it in Gmail.It\'s pretty bad that they said nothing about this, but it makes sense. Because most hijacked emails are logged into using software outside of gmail, and I\'m guessing you are required to have a stronger password if you want to use Gmail outside of the Gmail environment.I hope this helps!In addition to the other troubleshooting steps above, I would also like to add that if you have enabled two-factor authentication (also known as two-step verification) on your GMail account, you must generate an application-specific password and use that newly generated password to authenticate via SMTP.To create one, visit: https://www.google.com/settings/ and choose Authorizing applications & sites to generate the password.Link to Gmail SettingI\'ve had some problems sending emails from my gmail account too, which were due to several of the aforementioned situations.\nHere\'s a summary of how I got it working, and keeping it flexible at the same time:And now whenever you want to send emails all you need to do is call SSLMail.SendMail:e.g. in a Page with a PasswordRecovery control:Or anywhere in your code you can call:I hope this helps anyone who runs into this post! (I used VB.NET but I think it\'s trivial to convert it to any .NET language.)If you get an error like "The SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client was not authenticated. The server response was: 5.5.1 Authentication Required. Learn more at" as I get before this, make sure the line SMTPClientObj.UseDefaultCredentials = False included and this line should before the SMTPClientObj.Credentials.I did try to switch these 2 lines the opposite way and the 5.5.1 Authentication Required error returned.Oh...It\'s amazing...\nFirst I Couldn\'t send an email for any reasons.\nBut after I changed the sequence of these two lines as below, it works perfectly.Hope this help!!!  :)The problem is not one of technical ability to send through gmail.  That works for most situations.  If you can\'t get a machine to send, it is usually due to the machine not having been authenticated with a human at the controls at least once.The problem that most users face is that Google decides to change the outbound limits all the time.  You should always add defensive code to your solution.  If you start seeing errors, step off your send speed and just stop sending for a while.  If you keep trying to send Google will sometimes add extra time to your delay period before you can send again.What I have done in my current system is to send with a 1.5 second delay between each message.  Then if I get any errors, stop for 5 minutes and then start again.  This usually works and will allow you to send up to the limits of the account (last I checked it was 2,000 for premier customer logins per day).I had the same problem, but it turned out to be my virus protection was blocking outgoing "spam" email. Turning this off allowed me to use port 587 to send SMTP email via GMailI\'m not sure which .NET version is required for this because eglasius mentioned there is no matching enableSsl setting (I\'m using .NET 4.0, but I suspect it to work in .NET 2.0 or later), but this configuration justed worked for me (and doesn\'t require you to use any programmatic configuration):You might have to enable POP or IMAP on your Gmail account first:\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#settings/fwdandpopI recommend trying it with a normal mail client first...If nothing else has worked here for you you may need to allow access to your gmail account from third party applications. This was my problem. To allow access do the following:This worked for me hope it works for someone else!Simple steps to fix this:1)Sign in to your Gmail2)Navigate to this page https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps & set to "Turn On"I also found that the account I used to log in was de-activated by google for some reason.  Once I reset my password (to the same as it used to be), then I was able to send emails just fine.  I was getting 5.5.1 message also.I had also try to many solution but make some changes it will workwith smtpclient above parameters are work in gmail@Andres Pompiglio: Yes that\'s right you must change your password at least once..\nthis codes works just fine:AND you can make a call to the function by using:I ran into this same error ( "The SMTP server requires a secure connection or the client was not authenticated. The server response was: 5.5.1 Authentication Required. Learn more at" ) and found out that I was using the wrong password. I fixed the login credentials, and it sent correctly.I know this is late, but maybe this will help someone else.Another thing that I\'ve found is that you must change your password at least once.\nAnd try to use a secure level password (do not use the same user as password, 123456, etc.)I was using corporate VPN connection. It was the reason why I couldn\'t send email from my application. It works if I disconnect from VPN.I was getting the same error and none of the above solutions helped.My problem was that I was running the code from a remote server, which had never been used to log into the gmail account. I opened a browser on the remote server and logged into gmail from there. It asked a security question to verify it was me since this was a new location. After doing the security check I was able to authenticate through code.Yet another possible solution for you. I was having similar problems connecting to gmail via IMAP. After trying all the solutions that I came across that you will read about here and elsewhere on SO (eg. enable IMAP, enable less secure access to your mail, using https://accounts.google.com/b/0/displayunlockcaptcha and so on), I actually set up a new gmail account once more. In my original test, the first gmail account I had created, I had connected to my main gmail account. This resulted in erratic behaviour where the wrong account was being referenced by google. For example, running https://accounts.google.com/b/0/displayunlockcaptcha opened up my main account rather than the one I had created for the purpose. So when I created a new account and did not connect it to my main account, after following all the appropriate steps as above, I found that it worked fine!I haven\'t yet confirmed this (ie. reproduced), but it apparently did it for me...hope it helps. We strongly recommend that you use a secure app, like Gmail, to access your account. All apps made by Google meet these security standards. Using a less secure app, on the other hand, could leave your account vulnerable. Learn more.Set before You can also connect via port 465, but due to some limitations of the System.Net.Mail namespace you may have to alter your code. This is because the namespace does not offer the ability to make implicit SSL connections. This is discussed at http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdav_101/archive/2008/06/02/system-net-mail-with-ssl-to-authenticate-against-port-465.aspx, and I have supplied an example of how to use the CDO (Collaborative Data Object) in another discussion (GMail SMTP via C# .Net errors on all ports).I had this problem resolved. Aparently that message is used in multiple error types.\nMy problem was that i had reached my maximum of 500 sent mails.log into the account and manually try to send a mail. If the limit has been reached it will inform youTurn on less secure apps for your account: https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureappsGo through this article for more detailsOne or more reasons are there for these error.Log in with your Gmail( or any other if ) in your local system.Also check for Less Secure App and Set it to "Turn On" here is the Link for GMAIL.\nhttps://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureappscheck for EnableSsl in your Email code, and also set it to true.Also check which port are you using currently. 25 is Global, but you can check it for others too like 587. \ncheck here. Does all SMTP communication happen over 25?IF YOU ARE ON REMOTE : Check the answer of Vlad Tamas above.Change your gmail password and try again, it should work after that.Don\'t know why, but every time you change your hosting you have to change your password.
