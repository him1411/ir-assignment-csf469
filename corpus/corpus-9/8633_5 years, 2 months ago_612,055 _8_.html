This question already has an answer here:I\'d like to know, is there a Python equivalent for the case statement such as the examples available on VB.net or C#?While the official docs are happy not to provide switch, I have seen a solution using dictionaries.For example:Then the equivalent switch block is invoked:This begins to fall apart if you heavily depend on fall through.The direct replacement is if/elif/else. However, in many cases there are better ways to do it in Python. See "Replacements for switch statement in Python?".
