How do you get all the classes in a namespace through reflection in C#?Following code prints names of classes in specified namespace defined in current assembly.\nAs other guys pointed out, a namespace can be scattered between different modules, so you need to get a list of assemblies first.As FlySwat says, you can have the same namespace spanning in multiple assemblies (for eg System.Collections.Generic). You will have to load all those assemblies if they are not already loaded. So for a complete answer:This should work unless you want classes of other domains. To get a list of all domains, follow this link.Here\'s a fix for LoaderException errors you\'re likely to find if one of the types sublasses a type in another assembly:That should help with loading types defined in other assemblies.Hope that helps!You won\'t be able to get all types in a namespace, because a namespace can bridge multiple assemblies, but you can get all classes in an assembly and check to see if they belong to that namespace.Assembly.GetTypes() works on the local assembly, or you can load an assembly first then call GetTypes() on it.For a specific Assembly, with a class name filter:Note: The project must reference the assemblyJust like @aku answer, but using extension methods:Namespaces are actually rather passive in the design of the runtime and serve primarily as organizational tools. The Full Name of a type in .NET consists of the Namespace and Class/Enum/Etc. combined. If you only wish to go through a specific assembly, you would simply loop through the types returned by assembly.GetExportedTypes() checking the value of type.Namespace. If you were trying to go through all assemblies loaded in the current AppDomain it would involve using AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()Get all classes by part of Namespace name:Quite simple
