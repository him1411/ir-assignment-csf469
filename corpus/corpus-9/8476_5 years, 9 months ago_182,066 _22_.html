Assume I have this:and by searching "Pam" as name, I want to retrieve the related dictionary: {name: "Pam", age: 7}How to achieve this ?You can use a generator expression:This looks to me the most pythonic way:result:You can use a list comprehension:@Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric Hamidi\'s answer is great.  In Python 3.x the syntax for .next() changed slightly.  Thus a slight modification:As mentioned in the comments by @Matt, you can add a default value as such:This is a general way of searching a value in a list of dictionaries:To add just a tiny bit to @Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ricHamidi.In case you are not sure a key is in the the list of dicts, something like this would help:This is one way...My first thought would be that you might want to consider creating a dictionary of these dictionaries ... if, for example, you were going to be searching it more a than small number of times.However that might be a premature optimization.  What would be wrong with:Have you ever tried out the pandas package? It\'s perfect for this kind of search task and optimized too.I\'ve added a little bit of benchmarking below to illustrate pandas\' faster runtimes on a larger scale i.e. 100k+ entries:Here is a comparison using iterating throuhg list, using filter+lambda or refactoring(if needed or valid to your case) your code to dict of dicts rather than list of dictsAnd the output is this:Conclusion:\nClearly having a dictionary of dicts is the most efficient way to be able to search in those cases, where you know say you will be searching by id\'s only.\ninterestingly using filter is the slowest solution.You have to go through all elements of the list. There is not a shortcut!Unless somewhere else you keep a dictionary of the names pointing to the items of the list, but then you have to take care of the consequences of popping an element from your list.
