I\'m having a problem trying to run an Android app which, up until adding a second external library to its build path, was working fine. Since having added the scoreninja jar, I now get a NoClassDefFoundError when I try to run the app.Here\'s the message:As all of the build scripts are generated by the Android tools (?), I\'m not sure what else I can do other than cleaning and rebuilding or restarting eclipse (I have already tried all three). Does anyone know how I can amend this?I had this problem after updating ADT.I was storing all of my JAR files in a folder called "lib" and adding the jars to the build path the normal Eclipse way.  This worked fine until my update.After my update, I was getting the NoClassDefFoundError for a class that I could clearly see was included in the jar (checking out the ReferencedLibraries classes).The solution was to remove my jars from the build path and rename my "lib" folder to "libs".  This is an ant convention, and seems to be the way the new ADT finds and includes libraries in an .apk file. Once I did this, everything worked fine.I didn\'t have to put the jar-library in assets or lib(s), but only tick the box for this jar in Properties -> Java Build Path -> "Order and Export" (it was listed before, but not selected)By adding the external jar into your build path just adds the jar to your package, but it will not be available during runtime.In order for the jar to be available at runtime, you need to:I had this for MapActivity. Builds in Eclipse gets NoClassDefFound in debugger.Forgot to add library to manifest, inside <Application>...</Application> elementI have changed the order of included projects (Eclipse / Configure Build Path / Order and Export). I have moved my two dependent projects to the top of the "Order and Export" list. It solved the problem "NoClassDefFoundError".It is strange for me. I didn\'t heard about the importance of the order of included libraries and projects. Android + Eclipse is fun :)I\'m not sure if this is related, or if you\'re even still looking for an answer, but I came across this thread while trying to research the same error (but possibly for different reasons).I couldn\'t find any solutions online, but an answer on a similar thread got me thinking and realized I probably just needed to rebuild (or clean) the project.In Eclipse, go to Project => Clean. Select your project and Eclipse seemed to fix it itself. For me this solved the problem.Hope this helps.I have encountered the same issue. The reason was that the library that I was trying to use had been compiled with a standard JDK 7.I recompiled it with the -source 1.6 -target 1.6 options and it worked fine.Same thing worked for me: Properties -> Java Build Path -> "Order and Export"\nInterestingly - why this is not done automatically? \nI guess some setting is missing. Also this happened for me after SDK upgrade. Right click your project folder, look for Properties in Java build path and select the jar files that you see. It has worked for me. John O\'Connor is right with the issue. The problem stays with installing ADT 17 and above. Found this link for fixing the error:http://android.foxykeep.com/dev/how-to-fix-the-classdefnotfounderror-with-adt-17I tried everything from this post (and some other posts), and it didn\'t worked for me, this is by far the most terrible ADT upgrade I have experienced, and I will never upgrade without a working ADT backup.I managed to solve it by removing the project, and then adding it again using a source backup I had.I had this same error with ADT22. Resolved it checking "Android Private Libraries" in properties -> Java build path -> Order and export. If you are using any library projects, the same should be done for them as well. All the existing answers don\'t work for me because my case is a little bit different. It took me a few hours to get it to work. I\'m using Eclipse.My android project includes another normal java 1.6 project, which needs a 3rd party jar file. The trick is:Hope this help those who have similar scenarios like mine.sometimes you have to take the whole external project as library and not only the jar:my problem solved by adding the whole project (in my case google-play-services_lib) as library and not only the jar. the steps to to it (from @style answer):Sometimes it will happen due to not including jar, which you have dependency, with "uses-libary"  tag in your AndroidManifest.xml.Also, make sure it should be inside "application" tag.Regards,RaviI had this problem and it was caused by not "exporting" the library.Issue was just because the .class files for some classes are  not available while packaging the APK.Compile time it will work fine with out exporitingIn my case I was using "CusrsorAdapter" class and under "JavaBuildPath->Order and Export" I didn\'t check the support V4 jar.Once it is selected issue is gone.To make sure you are getting noClassDefFound error because of above reason, please check your logacat, you will see unknown super classs error at run time.I tried various things and the reason for error in my case was conflict between maps.jar and Google Api in Java Build Path-> Libraries. So, when i removed the maps.jar it worked fine. Regards,wahibplease make sure your jar file is in the libs directory of your project in you are using newer ADT version with your eclipse.I got the exact same problem ... To fix it, I just removed my Android Private Libs in "build path" and clicked ok ... and when i opened op the "build path" again eclipse had added them by itself again, and then it worked for me ;)... i spent two days trying to solve this issue after updating ADT. finally i was lucky to get this post here: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=55304 which led me in the right direction. when you follow the solution - remember to replace the android support library of all your projects to the same version (remove it and re-install it to the projects). i hope this helps - good luckIf you prefer to know which files the workaround is related to here\'s what I found. Simple change the .classpath file toReplace the .classpath file in all library projects and in main android project. The .classpath file is in the root folder of the eclipse project. Of cause don\'t forget to add your own classpath entries, should you have any (so compare with your current version of .classpath).I believe this is the same result as going through the eclipse menus as componavt-user explained above (Eclipse / Configure Build Path / Order and Export).The solution here worked for me. It\'s a matter of importing the library to the libs folder, then modifying the build.gradle file and then cleaning with gradlew.If you change your order and export in your project build path, this error will not occur. \nThe other way of achieving it is through .classpath in your project folder. Try this:-Step 1Add all the libraries to build pat in Eclipse( means make all libraries referenced libraries)Step 2Delete R.java file and again build the project. Don\'t worry, R.java will automatically get recreated.Chill :)As i understood, your Project shows no errors, because you included the Jar. But the Jar won\'t be used, when your Project got "exported" to the device. \nTry thisProject -> PropertiesJava Build Path / Order and Export[\xe2\x9c\x94] Your JarThis happens quite very often to me.Last time that happened I can remembered was caused by switching the Eclipse ADT (Google special edition) to Android Studio, and switching back. I basically tried all methods that I can found on stackoverflow which didn\'t work for me.Eventually, I got the app working again (no more NoCalssDeffoundError) by switching my IDE to original Eclipse (Kepler) with ADT.Acutally you have reached the infamous 64k limit issue, you need to enable multidex. This is how you do it. \nhttps://developer.android.com/tools/building/multidex.html
