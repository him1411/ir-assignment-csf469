Does anyone here have experience with/in developing IE extensions that can share their knowledge? This would include code samples, or links to good ones, or documentation on the process, or anything.I really want to do this, but I\'m hitting a giant wall with lousy documentation, lousy code/example code/lack thereof. Any help/resources you could offer would be greatly appreciated.Specifically, I would like to start with how to get access to/manipulate the DOM from within a IE extension. EDIT, even more details:Ideally, I would like to plant a toolbar button that, when clicked, popped a menu up that contains links to external sites. I would also like to access the DOM and plant JavaScript on the page depending on some conditions. What is the best way to persist information in an IE extension? In Firefox/Chrome/Most modern browsers, you use window.localStorage, but obviously with IE8/IE7, that\'s not an option. Maybe a SQLite DB or such? It is okay to assume that .NET 4.0 will be installed on a user\'s computer?I don\'t want to use Spice IE as I want to build one that is compatible with IE9 as well. I\'ve added the C++ tag to this question as well, because if it\'s better to build one in C++, I can do that. Man... this has been a lot of work!\nI was so curious about how to do this, that I did it myself.First of all... credit is not all mine. This is a compilation of what I found, on these sites:And of course, I wanted my answer to have the features you asked:I will describe it step by step, how I managed to do it working with Internet Explorer 8, in Windows 7 x64... note that I could not test in other configurations. Hope you understand =)I am using Visual Studio 2010, C# 4, .Net Framework 4, so some of these steps might be slightly different for you.Created a class library. I called mine InternetExplorerExtension.Add these references to the project:Note: These references may be in different places in each computer.this is what my references section in csproj contains:Create the following files:IEAddon.csInterop.csand finally a form, that we will use to configure the options. In this form place a TextBox and an Ok Button. Set the DialogResult of the button to Ok. Place this code in the form code:In the project properties, do the following:In the Build Events tab, set Post-build events command line to:Attention: as my computer is x64, there is a specific x64 inside the path of gacutil executable on my machine that may be different on yours.64bit IE Needs 64bit-compiled and 64bit-registered BHO. Use 64bit RegAsm.exe (usually lives in C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\RegAsm.exe) How this addon worksIt traverses all DOM tree, replacing the text, configured using the button, by itself with a yellow background. If you click on the yellowed texts, it calls a javascript function that was inserted on the page dynamically. The default word is \'browser\', so that it matches a lot of them!\nEDIT: after changing the string to be highlighted, you must click the URL box and press Enter... F5 will not work, I think that it is because F5 is considered as \'navigation\', and it would require to listen to navigate event (maybe). I\'ll try to fix that later.Now, it is time to go. I am very tired.\nFeel free to ask questions... may be I will not be abled to answer since I am going on a trip... in 3 days I\'m back, but I\'ll try to come here in the meantime.Another cool approach would be to check out:http://www.crossrider.orgIt\'s a framework based on JS with jquery which lets you develop browsers extensions for IE, FF and Chrome using a single common JS code. \nBasically the framework does all the nasty work and you\'re left with writing your applications code.The state for IE extensions is actually pretty sad. You have the old model of IE5 Browser Helper Object (yeah, those infamous BHOs that everyone liked to block back in the day), toolbars and the new accelerators for IE.\nEven then, compatibility will break sometimes. I used to maintain an extension for IE6 that broke with IE7, so there are some things that have changed. For the most part, as far as I know (I haven\'t touch BHOs in years) you still need to code them using Active Template Libraries (kind of like an STL for Microsoft\'s COM) and well as such is only for C++. \nYou could do COM Interop with C# and get away with doing it in C# but its probably going to be too hard for what it is worth.\nAnyway, if you are interested in coding your own extension for IE (which is plausible if you want to have your extensions available in all major browsers) here are the official Microsoft Resources.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa753587(v=vs.85).aspxAnd for the accelerators that are new in IE8 you could check this one.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc289775(v=vs.85).aspxI agree the documentation is terrible, and the APIs are quite outdated. Still I hope this helps.EDIT: I guess I can throw one last source of information here. I was looking through my notes of back when I was working on BHOs. And this is the article that got me started with them. It is kind of old, but has a good explanation of the ATL interfaces that you will be using when working with IE BHOs (IObjectWithSite for example). I think it is pretty well explained and helped me a lot back then.\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250436.aspx\nI also checked the example that GregC posted. It does work with at least IE8, and it is compatible with VS 2010, so if you want to do C# you can get started there and take a look at Jon Skeet\'s Book. (C# in Depth 2nd edition) Chapter 13 has a good deal of information about the new features in C# 4 that you can use to make the interaction with COM nicer. (I would still recommend you doing your addin in C++)Developing C# BHOs is a pain-in-the-arse.  It involves a lot of icky COM code and p/invoke calls.I have a mostly finished C# BHO here, which you are free to use the source for whatever you want.  I say "mostly", because I never did figure out how to save appdata under IE Protected Mode.I\'ve been working with IE\'s webbrowser control for years now, and over the course of them, one name comes up over and over again with helpful postings: Igor TandetnikIf I were developing an extension, I would target a BHO, and start googling for:BHO Igor TandetnikOR Browser Helper Object Igor TandetnikHis postings are often very detailed, and he knows what he is talking about.You\'re going to find yourself up to your ears in COM and ATL programming.\nFor a sample walkthrough, check out:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms976373.aspxI agree with Robert Harvey, C# 4.0 features improved COM interop.  Here\'s a bit of older C# code, in desperate need of a re-write.http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/Attach_BHO_with_C_.aspxThis is an attempt to simplify things by avoiding ATL and going with Spartan COM:C++ and COM to get BHOs goingIf you are not trying to reinvent the wheel, you might try Add In Express for IE . I have used the product for the VSTO stuff, and its pretty good. Also they have a helpful forum and quick support.It is obviously solved, but for the other users, I would recommend SpicIE framework. I have made my own extension based on it. It only supports Internet Explorer 7/8 officialy, but I tested that on Internet Explorer 6-10 (from Windows XP to Windows 8 Consumer Preview) and it works fine.\nUnfortunately there were some bugs in the latest release, so I had to fix them and made my own release:\nhttp://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/SpicIE/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=5251I warmly suggest you this post of Pavel Zolnikov published in 2002!http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2219/Extending-Explorer-with-Band-Objects-using-NET-andIt is based on the use of Band objects and is compiled using .Net 2.0. \nSource code is provided and opens and compiles well with Visual Studio 2013.\nAs you will read on the post comments it works perfectly well for IE 11 and on Windows 7 and Windows 10. \nIt worked perfectly well for me on Windows 7 + SP1 and IE 11\nEnjoy!In the Build Events tab, set Post-build events command line to: (x64) is listed belowI want the Build Events tab , set Post-build events command line to (32 bit operating system)
