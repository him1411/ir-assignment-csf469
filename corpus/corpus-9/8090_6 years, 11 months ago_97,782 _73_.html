Is there an easy way to add padding between the checkbox in a CheckBox control, and the associated text?I cannot just add leading spaces, because my label is multi-line.As-is, the text is way too close to the checkbox:\nI hate to answer my own question, but in this case I think I need to.  After checking it out, @Falmarri was on the right track with his answer.  The problem is that Android\'s CheckBox control already uses the android:paddingLeft property to get the text where it is.The red line shows the paddingLeft offset value of the entire CheckBoxIf I just override that padding in my XML layout, it messes up the layout.  Here\'s what setting paddingLeft="0" does:Turns out you can\'t fix this in XML.  You have do it in code.  Here\'s my snippet with a hardcoded padding increase of 10dp.This gives you the following, where the green line is the increase in padding.  This is safer than hardcoding a value, since different devices could use different drawables for the checkbox.UPDATE - As people have recently mentioned in answers below, this behavior has apparently changed in Jelly Bean (4.2).  Your app will need to check which version its running on, and use the appropriate method.Given @DougW response, what I do to manage version is simpler, I add to my checkbox view:where the dimen is found in two values folders:valuesvalues-v17 (4.2 JellyBean)I have a custom check, use the dps to your best choice.Use attribute android:drawableLeft instead of android:button. In order to set padding between drawable and text use android:drawablePadding. To position drawable use android:paddingLeft.Android 4.2 Jelly Bean (API 17) puts the text paddingLeft from the buttonDrawable (ints right edge). It also works for RTL mode. Before 4.2 paddingLeft was ignoring the buttonDrawable - it was taken from the left edge of the CompoundButton view.You can solve it via XML - set paddingLeft to buttonDrawable.width + requiredSpace on older androids. Set it to requiredSpace only on API 17 up. For example use dimension resources and override in values-v17 resource folder.The change was introduced via android.widget.CompoundButton.getCompoundPaddingLeft();Yes, you can add padding by adding padding.android:padding=5dpIf you want a clean design without codes, use:The trick is to set colour to transparent for android:drawableLeft and assign a value for android:drawablePadding. Also, transparency allows you to use this technique on any background colour without the side effect - like colour mismatch.Why not just extend the Android CheckBox to have better padding instead. That way instead of having to fix it in code every time you use the CheckBox you can just use the fixed CheckBox instead. First Extend CheckBox:Second in your xml instead of creating a normal CheckBox create your extended one Simple solution, add this line in the CheckBox properties, replace 10dp with your desired spacing valueI don\'t know guys, but I tested <CheckBox android:paddingLeft="8mm" and only moves the text to the right, not entire control. It suits me fine.In my case I solved this problem using this following CheckBox attribute in the XML:*android:paddingLeft="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"*API 17 and above, you can use:android:paddingStart="24dp"API 16 and below, you can use:android:paddingLeft="24dp"I just concluded in this: Override CheckBox and add this method if you have a custom drawable:or this if you use the system drawable:Thanks for the answer :)This behavior appears to have changed in Jelly Bean. The paddingLeft trick adds additional padding, making the text look too far right. Any one else notice that?If you have custom image selector for checkbox or radiobutton you must set same button and background property such as this:You can control size of checkbox or radio button padding with background property.If you are creating custom buttons, e.g. see change look of checkbox tutorialThen simply increase the width of btn_check_label_background.9.png by adding one or two more columns of transparent pixels in the center of the image; leave the 9-patch markers as they are.What I did, is having a TextView and a CheckBox inside a (Relative)Layout. The TextView displays the text that I want the user to see, and the CheckBox doesn\'t have any text. That way, I can set the position / padding of the CheckBox wherever I want.only you need to have one parameter in xml fileI had the same problem with a Galaxy S3 mini (android 4.1.2) and I simply made my custom checkbox extend AppCompatCheckBox  instead of CheckBox. Now it works perfectly.You need to get the size of the image that you are using in order to add your padding to this size. On the Android internals, they get the drawable you specify on src and use its size afterwards. Since it\'s a private variable and there are no getters you cannot access to it. Also you cannot get the com.android.internal.R.styleable.CompoundButton and get the drawable from there.So you need to create your own styleable (i.e. custom_src) or you can add it directly in your implementation of the RadioButton:As you probably use a drawable selector for your android:button property you need to add android:constantSize="true" and/or specify a default drawable like this:After that you need to specify android:paddingLeft attribute in your checkbox xml.Cons:In the layout editor you will the text going under the checkbox with api 16 and below, in that case you can fix it by creating you custom checkbox class like suggested but for api level 16.Rationale:it is a bug as StateListDrawable#getIntrinsicWidth() call is used internally in CompoundButton but it may return < 0 value if there is no current state and no constant size is used.All you have to do to overcome this problem is to add android:singleLine="true" to the checkBox in your android xml layout:and nothing special will be added programmatically.Checkbox image was overlapping when I used my own drawables from selector, I have solve this using below code :Thanks to Alex Semeniuk I end up with this issue by changing the images. \nJust added extra transparent background in png files.\nThis solution works excellent on all the APIs.Maybe it is to late, but I\'ve created utility methods to manage this issue.Just add this methods to your utils:And use like this:or like this:Instead of adjusting the text for Checkbox, I have done following thing and it worked for me for all the devices.\n1) In XML, add checkbox and a textview to adjacent to one after another; keeping some distance.\n2) Set checkbox text size to 0sp.\n3) Add relative text to that textview next to the checkbox.<CheckBox android:drawablePadding="16dip" - The padding between the drawables and the text.
