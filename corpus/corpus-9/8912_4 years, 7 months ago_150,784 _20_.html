Anyone a suggestion on how to convert a string to a number in TypeScript?Update:\nI did some extra puzzling, the best sofar I\'ve come up with:\n    var aNumber : number = ( "1") * 1;checking if a string is numeric is answered here: In Typescript, How to check if a string is Numeric.You can use the parseInt or parseFloat functions, or simply use the unary + operator:The Typescript way to do this would be:as answered here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23440948/2083492Expounding on what Ryan said, TypeScript embraces the JavaScript idioms in general.All the interesting in-depth details at JavaScript Type Conversion.For our fellow Angular users:Within a template, Number(x) and parseInt(x) throws an error, and +x has no effect. Valid casting will be x*1 or x/1.As shown by other answers here, there are multiple ways to do the conversion:I\'d like to mention one more thing on parseInt though.When using parseInt, it makes sense to always pass the radix parameter. For decimal conversion, that is 10. This is the default value for the parameter, which is why it can be omitted. For binary, it\'s a 2 and 16 for hexadecimal. Actually, any radix between and including 2 and 36 works.The parseInt function, well, parses strings to convert them to numbers. In some JS implementations, parseInt parses leading zeros as octal:Although discouraged by ECMAScript 3 and forbidden by ECMAScript 5, many implementations interpret a numeric string beginning with a leading 0 as octal. The following may have an octal result, or it may have a decimal result. Always specify a radix to avoid this unreliable behavior.\xe2\x80\x94 MDNThe fact that code gets clearer is a nice side effect of specifying the radix parameter.Since parseFloat only parses numeric expressions in radix 10, there\'s no need for a radix parameter here.More on this:There are inbuilt functions like parseInt(), parseFloat() and Number() in Typescript, you can use those.
