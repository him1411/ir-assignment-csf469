How can I write an application that will crop images in C#?You can use Graphics.DrawImage to draw a cropped image onto the graphics object from a bitmap.Check out this link: http://www.switchonthecode.com/tutorials/csharp-tutorial-image-editing-saving-cropping-and-resizingSimpler than the accepted answer is this:and it avoids the "Out of memory" exception risk of the simplest answer.EDIT: I find this is fine with PNGs saved by Bitmap.Save or Paint.exe, but fails with PNGs saved by e.g. Paint Shop Pro 6 - the content is displaced. Addition of GraphicsUnit.Pixel gives a different wrong result. Perhaps just these failing PNGs are faulty.use bmp.SetResolution(image.HorizontalResolution, image .VerticalResolution);this may be necessary to do even if you implement best answer here\nespecially if your image is real great and resolutions are not exactly 96.0My test example:It\'s quite easy:If you\'re using AForge.NET:Here\'s a simple example on cropping an imageCropping an image is very easy in C#. However, doing the stuff how are you going to manage the cropping of your image will be a little harder.Sample below is the way how to crop an image in C#.There is a C# wrapper for that which is open source, hosted on Codeplex called Web Image CroppingRegister the control<%@ Register Assembly="CS.Web.UI.CropImage" Namespace="CS.Web.UI" TagPrefix="cs" %>ResizingCropping in code behind - Call Crop method when button clicked for example;wci1.Crop(Server.MapPath("images/sample1.jpg"));Only this sample working without problem:This is another way. In my case I have:Inside the button I have this code:I tried it in Visual studio 2012 using C#. I found this solution from this pagehere it is working demo on githubhttps://github.com/SystematixIndore/Crop-SaveImageInCSharpC# code logic for upload and crop.Assuming you mean that you want to take an image file (JPEG, BMP, TIFF, etc) and crop it then save it out as a smaller image file, I suggest using a third party tool that has a .NET API. Here are a few of the popular ones that I like:LeadTools\nAccusoft Pegasus\nSnowbound Imaging SDK
