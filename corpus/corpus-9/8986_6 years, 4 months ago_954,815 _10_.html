Possible Duplicate:\n  Java: generating random number in a range I would like to get a random value between 1 to 50 in Java.How may I do that with the help of Math.random();?How do I bound the values that Math.random() returns?This will give you value from 1 to 50 using Math.random()Why?random() method returns a random\n  number between 0.0 and 0.9..., you\n  multiply it by 50, so upper limit\n  becomes 0.0 to 49.999... when you add 1, it becomes 1.0 to 50.999..., now when you truncate to int, you get 1 to 50. (thanks to @rup in comments). leepoint\'s awesome write-up on both the approaches.This will give value from 0 to 49.For 1 to 50: rand.nextInt((max - min) + 1) + min;Source of some Java Random awesomeness.
