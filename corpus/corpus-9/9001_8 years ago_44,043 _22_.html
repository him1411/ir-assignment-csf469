I want to use the methods I defined in app/helpers/annotations_helper.rb in my ReportMailer views (app/views/report_mailer/usage_report.text.html.erb). How do I do this?Based on this guide it seems like the add_template_helper(helper_module) method might do what I want, but I can\'t figure out how to use it.(BTW, is there a reason you get access to a different set of helpers in mailer views? This is pretty annoying.)In the mailer class that you are using to manage your emails:In Rails 3, just use the helper method at the top of your ActionMailer class:I just passed in a block, since I only need it in the one Mailer:(be sure to set config.action_mailer.default_url_options.)(and if you use url_for, be sure to pass in :only_path => false)For all mailers in Rails 3 (setting "application" helper):For Ruby on Rails 4, I had to do 2 things:(1) As Duke already said, if the helper you want to add is UsersHelper for example, then addto the derived ActionMailer class (e.g. app/mailers/user_mailer.rb)(2) After that, I got a new error:To fix this, add the lineto each of the config/environments/*.rb files. For config/environments/production.rb, replace localhost with a more appropriate host for the production helper-generated urls.Q: For #2, why does the mail view need this information, and the regular views do not?A: Because the regular views don\'t need to know the host, since all generated links are served from the host they link to. Links that show up in emails are not served from the same host (unless you are linking to hotmail.com or gmail.com, etc.)You can just add in your maileror whatever helper you needin my case for Rails4, i do like this:and so that you do not have to specify add_template_helper everywhere.
