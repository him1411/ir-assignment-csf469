I\'m having a really frustrating issue: Rake is being dumb.Here\'s how the problem comes about:Both of those work just fine, but then when I do this,I get the following error.I\'ve looked about the Internet for similar/same errors, and people have had them. Just no one ever seems to solve the problem!How do I fix this problem?A tweet from DHH earlier. Rake .9.0 breaks Rails and several other things, you need to:in your Gemfile.I made some research just after my previous answer (sorry, I must do before it).All problems are solved with Rake gem 0.9.2.. I followed these steps:then the db:migrate showed a warning, WARNING: Global access to Rake DSL methods is deprecated.  Please....It was solved by adding the following to the Rake file.I ommited the module ::RakeFileUtils extend Rake::FileUtilsExtend option sugested by @databyte.It means that the Rake gem 0.9.2 works fine!Going through Chapter 2 of Railstutorial (demo_app) and ran into this problem. I tried all of the other answers listed here, but couldn\'t get it to work until I did this:Put this in your Rakefile above require \'rake\':via How to fix the uninitialized constant Rake::DSL problem on Heroku?I also recommitted and pushed all files to Github and Heroku. All I needed to do was use:I had version 0.9.2 already, just needed installing.Reinstall the rake gem and it should work fine:If not, specify version \'0.8.7\' in your Gemfile.If not using Bundler:Then choose to uninstall 0.9.0.If like me you\'re stuck on rake 0.8.7, and you\'re using Rails 3.2.x then railties adds a requirement for Rake::DSLTo solve this, to the top of your Rakefile you should add:I solved the same problem with the following steps:In Gemfile:Then ran this on the console:Then added the following lines to Rakefile:Rails 3.1.rc1 has been updated.  For your own Rakefiles, you can add this before the call to load_tasks.https://gist.github.com/4cd2bbe68f98f2f0249fUPDATE: Also noticed it\'s already answered here as well: Undefined method 'task' using Rake 0.9.0I had the same issue and had to use the rake 0.8.7 gem instead of 0.9.0.I am a Windows XP user and I had the same problem. I entered gem "rake", "0.8.7" into the gemfile, and then typed the following from the command window.This fixed my problem.To start server type bundle exec rails s. Use bundle exec  and you will be sure that you use right gems (required version) for your project.\nAlso I would recommend you to add vendor/bundle to .gitignore if you use git and make alias for bundle exec. If you use zsh you can follow this approachSame as Branstar above - thanks Branstar!I followed the instructions in Running Rails 3 on Windows.All worked up until the "rake db:migrate" part which gave me the same output as original post.I ran:I ran again:Then I was able to start the Ruby on Rails server and had everything in place.Thanks again Branstar :-)I feel for you (mikhailvs), it\'s really frustrating. I have been going crazy for almost one full day. I even uninstalled Ruby and all its dependent files and shutdown my PC, but I still got the same problem.What I got from the error message is the problem with Rake 0.9.2. It seems like it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully installed. So I had to reinstall gem install rake -v=0.9.2I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I have rake \xe2\x80\x93v0.9.1 installed. So to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m safe I tried to remove that old version with gem uninstall rake -v=0.9.1. But is showed me the error message OK, so I checked all Rake directories on my PC, and found I only had Rake 0.9.2.\nThen to check if everything went alright, I migrated with rake db:migrate. And it worked :)I think I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Rake 0.9.1 because I clean-installed Ruby (rubyinstaller-1.9.2-p180 - on my WindowsÂ 7 system) and all gems as well. In the meantime Rake 0.9.2 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully installed.Uninstalling with "gem uninstall rake" worked for me, I had 2 versions installed, so I jest did a clean reinstall."rake db:create", to make sure the database exists\nand then "rake db:migrate" to seal the deal.I had the same issue using Rake 0.9.2.2. I solved this problem by using bundle exec.For Rails 2.3 editing lib/tasks/rspec.rake like in this commit worked for me:https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails/pull/11/filesInstall rake 0.8.7 and uninstall 0.9.2.2Now use i think this will help you\n;)Run it works for me.
