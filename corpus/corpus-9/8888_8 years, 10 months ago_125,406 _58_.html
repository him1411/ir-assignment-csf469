If for example you follow the link:data:application/octet-stream;base64,SGVsbG8=The browser will prompt you to download a file consisting of the data held as base64 in the hyperlink itself.  Is there any way of suggesting a default name in the markup?  If not, is there a JavaScript solution?Use the download attribute:Live example on html5-demos.appspot.com/....Currently works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, but not Safari 10 or IE11.Chrome makes this very simple these days:According to RFC 2397, no, there isn\'t.Nor does there appear to be any attribute of the <a> element that you can use either.However HTML5 has subsequently introduced the download attribute on the <a> element, although at the time of writing support is not universal (no MSIE support, for example)HTML only: use the download attribute:Javascript only: you can save any data URI with this code:Chrome, Firefox, and Edge 13+ will use the specified filename.IE11, Edge 12, and Safari 9 (which don\'t support the download attribute) will download the file with their default name or they will simply display it in a new tab, if it\'s of a supported file type: images, videos, audio files, \xe2\x80\xa6If need better compatibility now, use the Flash-based Downloadify as a fallback.I\'ve looked a bit in firefox sources in netwerk/protocol/data/nsDataHandler.cppdata handler only parses content/type and charset, and looks if there is ";base64"\nin the stringthe rfc specifices no filename and at least firefox handles no filename for it,\nthe code generates a random name plus ".part"I\'ve also checked firefox loginteresting files if you want to look at mozilla sources:I think you can stop searching a solution for now, because I suspect there is none :)as noticed in this thread html5 has download attribute, it works also on firefox 20 http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#attr-hyperlink-downloadThe following Javascript snippet works in Chrome by using the new \'download\' attribute of links and simulating a click.And the following example shows it\'s use:No.The entire purpose is that it\'s a datastream, not a file. The data source should not have any knowledge of the user agent handling it as a file... and it doesn\'t.you can add a download attribute to the anchor element. sample:Look at this link:\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2010Feb/0069.htmlQuote:It even works (as in, doesn\'t cause a problem) with ;base64 at the end\n  like this (in Opera at least):data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;headers=Content-Disposition%3A%20attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22with%20spaces.txt%22%0D%0AContent-Language%3A%20en;base64,4oiaDQo%3DAlso there is some info in the rest messages of the discussion.There is a tiny workaround script on Google Code that worked for me: http://code.google.com/p/download-data-uri/It adds a form with the data in it, submits it and then removes the form again. Hacky, but it did the job for me. Requires jQuery. This thread showed up in Google before the Google Code page and I thought it might be helpful to have the link in here, too.It\'s kind of hackish, but I\'ve been in the same situation before. I was dynamically generating a text file in javascript and wanted to provide it for download by encoding it with the data-URI.This is possible with minormajor user intervention. Generate a link <a href="data:...">right-click me and select "Save Link As..." and save as "example.txt"</a>. As I said, this is inelegant, but it works if you do not need a professional solution.This could be made less painful by using flash to copy the name into the clipboard first. Of course if you let yourself use Flash or Java (now with less and less browser support I think?), you could probably find a another way to do this.Here is a jQuery version based off of Holf\'s version and works with Chrome and Firefox whereas his version seems to only work with Chrome.  It\'s a little strange to add something to the body to do this but if someone has a better option I\'m all for it.Using service workers, this is finally possible in the truest sense.The browser will now suggest myPrettyName.jpg even if the user opens the file in a new tab, and tries to save it there. It will be exactly as if the file had come from the server.This one works with Firefox 43.0 (older not tested):dl.js:dl.htmlIf button is clicked it offered a file named hello.bin for download. Trick is to use File instead of Blob.reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/FileThe answer is simple that even most people did not expect it.We can just add a slash after the link to be downloaded and put the filename we need after that slash.For example:<a href"http://foo.goo/xxoo.mp4/nice.mp4"></a> The download dialog would pop with a default filename nice.mp4 instead of xxoo.mp4The data:URI follow the same ruleYou actually can achieve this, in Chrome and FireFox.Try the following url, it will download the code that was used.
