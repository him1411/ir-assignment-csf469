I\'m capturing an image and setting it to image view.But the problem is, the image on some devices every time it gets rotated. For example, on a Samsung device it works good, but on a Sony Xperia the image gets rotated by 90 degrees and on Toshiba Thrive (tablet) by 180 degrees.Most phone cameras are landscape, meaning if you take the photo in portrait, the resulting photos will be rotated 90 degrees. In this case, the camera software should populate the Exif data with the orientation that the photo should be viewed in.Note that the below solution depends on the camera software/device manufacturer populating the Exif data, so it will work in most cases, but it is not a 100% reliable solution.Here is the rotateImage method:By combining Jason Robinson\'s answer with Felix\'s answer and filling the missing parts, here is the final complete solution for this issue that will do the following after testing it on Android AndroidÂ 4.1 (Jelly Bean), Android 4.4 (KitKat) and Android 5.0 (Lollipop).StepsScale down the image if it was bigger than 1024x1024.Rotate the image to the right orientation only if it was rotate 90, 180 or 270 degree.Recycle the rotated image for memory purposes.Here is the code part:Call the following method with the current Context and the image URI that you want to fixHere is the CalculateInSampleSize method from the pre mentioned source:Then comes the method that will check the current image orientation to decide the rotation angleFinally the rotation method itself-Don\'t forget to vote up for those guys answers for their efforts and Shirish Herwade who asked this helpful question.It\'s easy to detect the image orientation and replace the bitmap using:To avoid Out of memories with big images, I\'d recommend you to rescale the image using:It\'s not posible to use ExifInterface to get the orientation because an Android OS issue:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=19268And here is calculateInSampleSizeOne line solution:Or This will autodetect rotation and place image in correct orientationPicasso is a very powerful library for handling images in your app includes:\nComplex image transformations with minimal memory use.activity_main.xmlMainActivity.javaNormally it is recommended to solve the problem with the ExifInterface, like @Jason Robinson did suggest. If this approach doesn\'t work, you could try to look up the Orientation of the latest image taken...You can just read the orientation of the camera sensor like indicated by Google in the documentation: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCharacteristics.htmlSample code:Sadly, @jason-robinson answer above didn\'t work for me. Although the rotate function works perfectly:I had to do the following to get the orientation as the Exif orientation was always 0If somebody experiences problems with ExifInterface on Android 4.4 (KitKat) for getting the orientation, it might be because of wrong path got from the URI. See a solution for propoer getPath in Stack Overflow question Get real path from URI, Android KitKat new storage access frameworkThe selected answer uses the most common method answered to this and similar questions. However, it does not work with both front and back cameras on Samsung. For those looking for a solution which works across both front and back cameras for Samsung and other major manufacturers, this answer by nvhausid is awesome:https://stackoverflow.com/a/18915443/6080472For those who don\'t want to click through, the relevant magic is to use the CameraInfo rather then relying on EXIF. Full code in the link.Better try to take the picture in a specific orientation.For best results give landscape orientation in the cameraview activity.This maybe goes without saying but always remember that you can handle some of these image handling issues on your server. I used responses like the ones contained in this thread to handle the immediate display of the image. However my application requires images to be stored on the server (this is probably a common requirement if you want the image to persist as users switch phones).The solutions contained in many of the threads concerning this topic don\'t discuss the lack of persistence of the EXIF data which doesn\'t survive the Bitmap\'s image compression, meaning you\'ll need to rotate the image each time your server loads it. Alternatively, you can send the EXIF orientation data to your server, and then rotate the image there if needed.It was easier for me to create a permanent solution on a server because I didn\'t have to worry about Android\'s clandestine file paths.I have spent a lot of time looking for solution for this. And finally managed to do this. Don\'t forget to upvote @Jason Robinson answer because my is based on his.So first thing, you sholuld know that since Android 7.0 we have to use FileProvider and something called ContentUri, otherwise you will get an annoying error trying to invoke your Intent. This is sample code:Method getUriFromPath(Context, String) basis on user version of Android create FileUri (file://...) or ContentUri (content://...) and there it is:After onActivityResult you can catch that uri where image is saved by camera, but now you have to detect camera rotation, here we will use moddified @Jason Robinson answer:First we need to create ExifInterface based on UriAbove code can be simplified, but i want to show everything. So from FileUri we can create ExifInterface based on String path, but from ContentUri we can\'t, Android doesn\'t support that. In that case we have to use other constructor based on InputStream. Remember this constructor isn\'t available by default, you have to add additional library:Now we can use getExifInterface method to get our angle:Now you have Angle to properly rotate you image :).There is a more simple command to fix this error.Just simply add after yourImageView.setBitmap(bitmap); this yourImageView.setRotation(90);This fixed mine. Hope it helps !Try the following, if you\'re are facing a problem with S4.
