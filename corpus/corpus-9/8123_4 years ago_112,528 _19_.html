I have two questions. I understand that if I specify the domain as .mydomain.com (with the leading dot) in the cookie that all subdomains can share a cookie.Can subdomain.mydomain.com access a cookie created in mydomain.com (without the www subdomain)? Can mydomain.com (without the www subdomain) access the cookie if created in subdomain.mydomain.com?The 2 domains mydomain.com and subdomain.mydomain.com can only share cookies if the domain is explicitly named in the Set-Cookie header. Otherwise, the scope of the cookie is restricted to the request host. (This is referred to as a "host-only cookie". See What is a host only cookie?)For instance, if you sent the following header from subdomain.mydomain.com:Then the cookie won\'t be sent for requests to mydomain.com. However if you use the following, it will be usable on both domains:In RFC 2109, a domain without a leading dot meant that it could not be used on subdomains, and only a leading dot (.mydomain.com) would allow it to be used across subdomains.However, modern browsers respect the newer specification RFC 6265, and will ignore any leading dot, meaning you can use the cookie on subdomains as well as the top-level domain.In summary, if you set a cookie like the second example above from mydomain.com, it would be accessible by subdomain.mydomain.com, and vice versa.See also:I\'m not sure @cmbuckley answer is showing the full picture. What I read is:AlsoTo me that means you can protect cookies from being read by subdomain/domain but cannot prevent writing cookies to the other domains. So somebody may rewrite your site cookies by controlling another subdomain visited by the same browser. Which might not be a big concern.Awesome cookies test site provided by @cmbuckley /for those that missed it in his answer like me; worth scrolling up and upvoting/:In both cases yes it can, and this is the default behaviour for both IE and Edge.The other answers add valuable insight but chiefly describe the behaviour in Chrome. it\'s important to note that the behaviour is completely different in IE. CMBuckley\'s very helpful test script demonstrates that in (say) Chrome, the cookies are not shared between root and subdomains when no domain is specified. However the same test in IE shows that they are shared. This IE case is closer to the take-home description in CMBuckley\'s www-or-not-www link. I know this to be the case because we have a system that used different servicestack cookies on both the root and subdomain. It all worked fine until someone accessed it in IE and the two systems fought over whose session cookie would win until we blew up the cache.Simple solutionSetcookie\'s 5th parameter determines the (sub)domains that the cookie is available to.  Setting it to (EXAMPLE.COM) makes it available to any subdomain (eg: SUBDOMAIN.EXAMPLE.COM )Reference: http://php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php
