I want to grep for the string that starts with a dash/hyphen, like -X, in a file, but it\'s confusing this as a command line argument. I\'ve tried:Use:grep -- -XRelated: What does a bare double dash mean? (thanks to nutty about natty).The dash character is a special character in Bash as noted at http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html#DASHREF. So escaping this once just gets you past Bash, but Grep still has it\'s own meaning to dashes (by providing options).So you really need to escape it twice (if you prefer not to use the other mentioned answers). The following will/should workOne way to try out how Bash passes arguments to a script/program is to create a .sh script that just echos all the arguments. I use a script called echo-args.sh to play with from time to time, all it contains is:I invoke it as:You get the idea.grep -e -X will do the trick.I dont have access to a Solaris machine, but grep "\\-X" works for me on linux.The correct way would be to use "--" to stop processing arguments, as already mentioned. This is due to the usage of getopt_long (GNU C-function from getopt.h) in the source of the tool.This is why you notice the same phenomena on other command-line tools; since most of them are GNU tools, and use this call,they exhibit the same behavior.As a side note - getopt_long is what gives us the cool choice between -rlo and --really_long_option and the combination of arguments in the interpreter.you can use nawkIf you\'re using another utility that passes a single argument to grep, you can use:Hope this one would serve your purpose.grep "^-X" fileIt will grep and pick all the lines form the file. \n^ in the grep"^" indicates a line starting with
