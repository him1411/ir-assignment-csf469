I have local changes to a file that I don\'t want to commit to my repository. It is a configuration file for building the application on a server, but I want to build locally with different settings. Naturally, the file always shows up when i do \'git status\' as something to be staged. I would like to hide this particular change and not commit it. I won\'t make any other changes to the file.After some digging around, I see 2 options: \'assume-unchanged\' and \'skip-worktree\'. A previous question here talks about them but doesn\'t really explain their differences. My question is this: how are the two commands different? Why would someone use one or the other?You want skip-worktree.assume-unchanged is designed for cases where it is expensive to check whether a group of files have been modified; when you set the bit, git (of course) assumes the files corresponding to that portion of the index have not been modified in the working copy. So it avoids a mess of stat calls. This bit is lost whenever the file\'s entry in the index changes (so, when the file is changed upstream).skip-worktree is more than that: even where git knows that the file has been modified (or needs to be modified by a reset --hard or the like), it will pretend it has not been, using the version from the index instead. This persists until the index is discarded.There is a good summary of the ramifications of this difference and the typical use cases here: http://fallengamer.livejournal.com/93321.html .From that article:Note: fallengamer did some tests in 2011 (so they may be outdated), and here are his findings:Operations.. .He adds the following analysis:It looks like skip-worktree is trying very hard to preserve your local data. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent you to get upstream changes if it is safe. Plus git doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reset the flag on pull.\nBut ignoring the \xe2\x80\x98reset --hard\' command could become a nasty surprise for a developer.Assume-unchanged flag could be lost on the pull operation and the local changes inside such files doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be important to git.See:He concludes:Actually neither of the flags is intuitive enough. assume-unchanged assumes that a developer shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change a file. If a file was changed \xe2\x80\x93 than that change is not important. This flag is meant for improving performance for not-changing folders like SDKs.\nBut if the promise is broken and a file is actually changed, git reverts the flag to reflect the reality. Probably it\xe2\x80\x99s ok to have some inconsistent flags in generally not-meant-to-be-changed folders. On the other hand skip-worktree is useful when you instruct git not to touch a specific file ever. That is useful for an already tracked config file.\nUpstream main repository hosts some production-ready config but you would like to change some settings in the config to be able to do some local testing. And you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to accidentally check the changes in such file to affect the production config. In that case skip-worktree makes perfect scene.
