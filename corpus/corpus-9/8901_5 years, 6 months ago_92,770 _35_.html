I just renamed my local branch usingbut this only renames the local version of the branch. How can I rename the one in github?As mentioned, delete the old one on Github & re-push, though the commands used are a bit more verbose than necessary:Simple.  Dissecting the commands a bit, the git push command is essentially:So doing a push with no local_branch specified essentially means "take nothing from my local repository, and make it the remote branch".  I\'ve always thought this to be completely kludgy, but it\'s the way it\'s done.Edit: As of Git 1.7 there is an alternate syntax for deleting a remote branch:Edit: As mentioned by @void.pointer in the commentsNote that you can combine the 2 push operations:git push origin :old_branch new_branchThis will both delete the old branch and push the new one.Just remove the old branch and create new one.Example (solely renaming the remote branch):You also probably should rename local branch and change settings for where to push/pull.Following commands worked for me:I\'ve found 3 command how you can change your git branch name, and these command are faster way to do thatIf you need step-by-step you can read this great articleHow to Rename Git Local and Remote BranchesYou can do that without terminal, you just need to create a branch with the new name, and remove the old after. You can use this post to do that.https://github.com/blog/1377-create-and-delete-branchesHere is what worked for me:1.) Create the new branch first:\ngit push github newname :refs/heads/newname2.) On github site, goto settings and change the Default branch to newname3.) Delete the oldname\ngit push github --delete oldnameThis article shows how to do it real easy.\n1. To rename a local Git branch, we can use the Git branch -m command to modify the name:\ngit branch -m feature1 feature2\n2. If you\xe2\x80\x99re just looking for the command to rename a remote Git branch, this is it" \ngit push -u origin feature2:feature3\n Check that you have no tags on the branch before you do this. You can do that with git tag.Another way is to rename the following files:Rename head & remotes both on your local PC and on origins(s)/remote server(s)If your current branch-name contains slashes (/) git will create the directories like so:current branch-name: "awe/some/branch"wish branch-name: "new-branch-name"Info: This way might not be the best, but it still works for people who might have problems with the other waysIn my case, I needed an additional command\n git branch --unset-upstream\nto get my renamed branch to push up to origin newname.  (For ease of typing), I first git checkout oldname.\nThen run the following:  git branch -m newname\ngit push origin :oldname or git push origin --delete oldname\ngit branch --unset-upstream\ngit push -u origin newname or git push origin newname This extra step may only be necessary because I (tend to) setup remote tracking on my branches via git push -u origin oldname.  This way when I have oldname checked out, I subsequently only need type git push rather than git push origin oldname If I do NOT use the command git branch --unset-upstream before git push origin newbranch, git re-creates oldbranch and pushes newbranch to origin oldbranch -- defeating my intent.
