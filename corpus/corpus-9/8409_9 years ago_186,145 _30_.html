How do I get my project\'s runtime dependencies copied into the target/lib folder?  As it is right now, after mvn clean install the target folder contains only my project\'s jar, but none of the runtime dependencies.This works for me:The best approach depends on what you want to do:Works for me with dependencies directory created in target folder. Like it!Take a look at the Maven dependency plugin, specifically, the dependency:copy-dependencies goal.  Take a look at the example under the heading The dependency:copy-dependencies mojo.  Set the outputDirectory configuration property to ${basedir}/target/lib (I believe, you\'ll have to test).Hope this helps.A simple and elegant solution for the case where one needs to copy the dependencies to a target directory without using any other phases of maven (I found this very useful when working with Vaadin).Complete pom example:Then run mvn process-sourcesThe jar file dependencies can be found in /target/dependencyTry something like this:If you want to do this on an occasional basis (and thus don\'t want to change your POM), try this command-line:If you omit the last argument, the dependences are placed in target/dependencies.If you want to deliver a bundle of your application jar, together with all it\'s dependencies and some scripts to invoke the MainClass, look at the appassembler-maven-plugin.The following configuration will generate scripts for Window and Linux to launch the application (with a generated path referencing all the dependency jars, download all dependencies (into a lib folder below target/appassembler). The assembly plugin can then be used to package the whole appassembler directory to a zip which is installed/deployed along with the jar to the repository.The assembly descriptor (in src/main/assembly) to package the direcotry as a zip would be:If you make your project a war or ear type maven will copy the dependencies.You can use the the Shade Plugin to create an uber jar in which you can bundle all your 3rd party dependencies.supposinghere ist what worked for me:Just to spell out what has already been said in brief. I wanted to create an executable JAR file that included my dependencies along with my code. This worked for me:(1) In the pom, under <build><plugins>, I included:(2) Running mvn compile assembly:assembly produced the desired my-project-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar in the project\'s target directory.(3) I ran the JAR with java -jar my-project-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jarIt\'s a heavy solution for embedding heavy dependencies, but Maven\'s Assembly Plugin does the trick for me.  @Rich Seller\'s answer should work, although for simpler cases you should only need this excerpt from the usage guide: If you\'re having problems related to dependencies not appearing in the WEB-INF/lib file when running on a Tomcat server in Eclipse, take a look at this:ClassNotFoundException DispatcherServlet when launching Tomcat (Maven dependencies not copied to wtpwebapps)You simply had to add the Maven Dependencies in Project Properties > Deployment Assembly.
