I want to design an app which shows a list of Wi-Fi networks available and connect to whichever network is selected by the user.I have implemented the part showing the scan results. Now I want to connect to a particular network selected by the user from the list of scan results.How do I do this?You need to create WifiConfiguration instance like this:Then, for WEP network you need to do this:For WPA network you need to add passphrase like this:For Open network you need to do this:Then, you need to add it to Android wifi manager settings:And finally, you might need to enable it, so Android connects to it:UPD: In case of WEP, if your password is in hex, you do not need to surround it with quotes. The earlier answer works, but the solution can actually be simpler. Looping through the configured networks list is not required as you get the network id when you add the network through the WifiManager.So the complete, simplified solution would look something like this:Before connecting WIFI network you need to check security type of the WIFI network ScanResult class has a capabilities. This field gives you type of networkRefer: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/ScanResult.html#capabilitiesThere are three types of WIFI networks.First, instantiate a WifiConfiguration object and fill in the network\xe2\x80\x99s SSID (note that it has to be enclosed in double quotes), set the initial state to disabled, and specify the network\xe2\x80\x99s priority (numbers around 40 seem to work well).Now for the more complicated part: we need to fill several members of WifiConfiguration to specify the network\xe2\x80\x99s security mode.\nFor open networks.For networks using WEP; note that the WEP key is also enclosed in double quotes.For networks using WPA and WPA2, we can set the same values for either.Finally, we can add the network to the WifiManager\xe2\x80\x99s known listCredit to @raji-ramamoorthi & @kenotaThe solution which worked for me is combination of above contributors in this thread. To get ScanResult here is the process.Notice to unregister it on onPause & onStop live this unregisterReceiver(broadcastReceiver);This is an activity you can subclass to force the connecting to a specific wifi:\nhttps://github.com/zoltanersek/android-wifi-activity/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/zoltanersek/androidwifiactivity/WifiActivity.javaYou will need to subclass this activity and implement its methods:Try this method. It\'s very easy:If your device knows the Wifi configs (already stored), we can bypass rocket science. Just loop through the configs an check if the SSID is matching. If so, connect and return.Set permissions:Connect:I broke my head to understand why your answers for WPA/WPA2 don\'t work...after hours of tries I found what you are missing:is REQUIRED for WPA networks!!!!Now, it works :)
