I have a getter to get the value from a cookie. Now I have 2 cookies by the name shares= and by the name obligations= . I want to make this getter only to get the values from the obligations cookie. How do I do this? So the \'for\' splits the data into separate values and puts it in an array.One approach, which avoids iterating over an array, would be: WalkthroughSplitting a string by token will produce either, an array with one string (same value), in case token does not exist in a string, or an array with two strings , in case token is found in a string . The first (left) element is string of what was before the token, and the second one (right) is what is string of what was after the token.(NOTE: in case string starts with a token, first element is an empty string)Considering that cookies are stored as follows:in order to retrieve specific cookie value, we just need to get string that is after "; {name}=" and before next ";". Before we do any processing, we prepend the cookies string with "; ", so that every cookie name, including the first one, is enclosed with "; " and "=":Now, we can first split by "; {name}=", and if token is found in a cookie string (i.e. we have two elements), we will end up with second element being a string that begins with our cookie value. Then we pull that out from an array (i.e. pop), and repeat the same process, but now with ";" as a token, but this time pulling out the left string (i.e. shift) to get the actual token value.use a cookie getting script:then call it:i stole the code above from quirksmode cookies page. you should read it.I would prefer using a single regular expression match on the cookie:If you use jQuery I recommend you to use this plugin:https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie\nhttps://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/blob/master/jquery.cookie.jsSo you can read cookie like this:Also you can write cookie:Delete cookie:The methods in some of the other answers that use a regular expression do not cover all cases, particularly:The following method handles these cases:This will return null if the cookie is not found. It will return an empty string if the value of the cookie is empty.Notes:Regular Expression Notes:I have modified the function that Jonathan provided here, by using regular expression you can get a cookie value by its name like this:If it returns empty string it means that the cookie exists but has no value, if it returns false then the cookie doesn\'t exist. I hope this helps.I know it is an old question but I came across this problem too. Just for the record, There is a little API in developers mozilla web page.Yoy can get any cookie by name using only JS. The code is also cleaner IMHO (except for the long line, that I\'m sure you can easily fix).As stated in the comments be aware that this method assumes that the key and value were encoded using encodeURIComponent(). Remove decode & encodeURIComponent() if the key and value of the cookie were not encoded. always works well:No requirements for jQuery or anything. Pure old good JavaScript.With this, you can easily access cookiesFrom now on you can just do:This will automatically update too, so if you change a cookie, the Cookies will change too.In my projects I use following function to access cookies by namekirlich gave a good solution. However, it fails when there are two cookie values with similar names, here is a simple fix for this situation:set by javascriptget by jqueryIt seems to me you could split the cookie key-value pairs into an array and base your search on that:Which runs the following:Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/qFmPc/Or possibly even the following:My solution is this:This function uses the Underscorejs _.find-function. Returns undefined if cookie name doesn\'t existDustin Diaz (the awesome) ranked this his all time useful function in JS. In his own words: "I hate the DOM implementations of setting cookies in JavaScript. In PHP it\'s so easy, and it\'s easy for one main reason, they work just like the function below"...see:http://www.dustindiaz.com/top-ten-javascriptSimple function for Get cookie with cookie name:Following function will return a key-value pair of the required cookie, where key is the cookie name and value will be the value of the cookie.Cookies example: example\nJS:Store arrays and objects with json or xmlI would do something like this:This will return your cookie as an object.And then you can call it like this:I like to use a closure for getting cookie values by name. The closure below will allow you to get a cookie value by name but will only parse the cookie string if it has been updated.You can retrieve the value of a cookie with the following: Code:Here is a pretty short versionNote that I made use of ES6\'s template strings to compose the regex expression.There are already nice answers here for getting the cookie,However here is my own solution :usage :`A functional approach to find existing cookies. It returns an array, so it supports multiple occurrences of the same name. It doesn\'t support partial key matching, but it\'s trivial to replace the === in the filter with a regex.
