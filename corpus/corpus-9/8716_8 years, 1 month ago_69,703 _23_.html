I have a form on a website which has a lot of different fields. Some of the fields are optional while some are mandatory. In my DB I have a table which holds all these values, is it better practice to insert a NULL value or an empty string into the DB columns where the user didn\'t put any data?By using NULL you can distinguish between "put no data" and "put empty data".Some more differences:A LENGTH of NULL is NULL, a LENGTH of an empty string is 0.NULLs are sorted before the empty strings.COUNT(message) will count empty strings but not NULLsYou can search for an empty string using a bound variable but not for a NULL. This query:will never match a NULL in mytext, whatever value you pass from the client. To match NULLs, you\'ll have to use other query:One thing to consider, if you ever plan on switching databases, is that Oracle does not support empty strings.  They are converted to NULL automatically and you can\'t query for them using clauses like WHERE somefield = \'\' .One thing to keep in mind is that NULL might make your codepaths much more difficult. In Python for example most database adapters / ORMs map NULL to None. So things like:might result in "Hello, None Joe Doe!" To avoid it you need something like this code:Which can make things much more complex.I don\'t know what best practice would be here, but I would generally err in favor of the null unless you want null to mean something different from empty-string, and the user\'s input matches your empty-string definition.Note that I\'m saying YOU need to define how you want them to be different. Sometimes it makes sense to have them different, sometimes it doesn\'t. If not, just pick one and stick with it. Like I said, I tend to favor the NULL most of the time.Oh, and bear in mind that if the column is null, the record is less likely to appear in practically any query that selects (has a where clause, in SQL terms) based off of that column, unless the selection is for a null column of course.Better to Insert NULL for consistency in your database in MySQL. Foreign keys can be stored as NULL but NOT as empty strings.You will have issues with an empty string in the constraints. \nYou may have to insert a fake record with a unique empty string to satisfy a Foreign Key constraint. Bad practice I guess.See also: Can a foreign key be NULL and/or duplicate?I don\'t know about performance. But in term of data quality, null is bad. Null gives you type maybe, which forces you to write runtime type check like: \nsomething = a.b.c.d.something if exist?(a) && exist?(a.b) && exist?(a.b.c) && exist?(a.b.c.d) && exist?(a.b.c.d.something). This problem could be mitigated if you are not using json/hash/array formats. But yes, letting null exist is a billion dollar mistake.
