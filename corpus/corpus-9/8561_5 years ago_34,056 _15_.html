Is there a way to profile Vim plugins?My MacVim becomes slower and slower when I open a large .py. I know I could deselect all plugins and reselect one by one to check which plugin is the culprit, but is there a faster way?My dotvim is here: https://github.com/charlax/dotvimYou can use built-in profiling support: after launching vim do(unlike quitting noautocmd is not really required, it just makes vim quit faster).Note: you won\xe2\x80\x99t get information about functions there were deleted before vim quit.I found another very helpful vim buildin method to show the exactly timing messages while loading your .vimrc.Please run:in VIM to get more information. It could be a plugin or the syntax highlighting; try a :syntax off when this happens and see whether Vim instantly gets faster.With plugins, a "general slowness" usually comes from autocommands; a :autocmd lists them all. Investigate by killing some of them via :autocmd! [group] {event}. Proceed from more frequent events (i.e. CursorMoved[I]) to less frequent ones (e.g. BufWinEnter).If you can somewhat reliably reproduce the slowness, a binary search might help: Move away half of the files in ~/.vim/plugin/, then the other, repeat in the set that was slow.If you really need to look under the hood, get a Vim version that has the :profile command enabled. (Not the vanilla BIG Windows version, but the one that ships with Cygwin has it; also, self-compiling is quite easy under most distros.)I have found it helpful to print all Vim activity to a file by starting Vim with the -V option:This provides the maximum verbosity (level 12) and outputs it to the file log. You can then perform some Vim actions which you know to be slow, and then see which functions/mappings are being called internally.
