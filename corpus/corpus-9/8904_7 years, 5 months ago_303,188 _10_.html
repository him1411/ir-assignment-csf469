I have a question about HTTPS and HTTP Authentication credentials.Suppose I secure a URL with HTTP Authentication:I then access that URL from a remote system via HTTPS, passing the credentials in the URL:Will the username and password be automatically SSL encrypted? Is the same true for GETs and POSTs? I\'m having a hard time locating a credible source with this information.Will the username and password be automatically SSL encrypted? Is the same true for GETs and POSTsYes, yes yes.The entire communication (save for the DNS lookup if the IP for the hostname isn\'t already cached) is encrypted when SSL is in use.Yes, it will be encrypted.You\'ll understand it if you simply check what happens behind the scenes.Not necessarily true. It will be encrypted on the wire however it still lands in the logs plain text
