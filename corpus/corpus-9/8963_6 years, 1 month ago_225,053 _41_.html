Possible Duplicate:\n  Close/hide the Android Soft KeyboardFirst thing first I already saw this thread. I tried accepted methods given there..But nothing worked for me..I have two screens in my app.In my first screen, I want username EditText to have focus on startup and Keyboard should be visible..This is my implementation (simplified by removing unnecessary/unrelated codes)..Well, the keyboard is not showing at start up. And my design badly require a keyboard there..Now on to second page..I already said I have a listView and EditText there..I want my keyboard to be hidden on start up only to appear when user touches the editText..Can you believe it?  whatever I tried soft Keyboard is showing when I load the activity..I am not able to hide it..To simplify And my problem is I am getting exact opposite on both occasion...Hope someone faced this issue before..BTW I am testing on simulator and HTC Desire phone..Well I got it working, with the help of all friends here.1. To Show keyboard on startupTwo answers worked for me. One provided by @CapDroid, which is to use a handler and post it delayed..Second answers is provided by @Dyarish, In fact he linked to another SO thread, which I haven\'t seen before. But \nthe funny thing is that, this solution is given in the thread which I referenced at start. And I haven\'t tried\nit out because it had zero votes in a thread where all other posts have plenty of votes..Height of foolishness..For me the second solution looked neat, so I decided to stick with it..But first one certainly works.\nAlso @Dyarish\'s answer contain a clever hack of using a ScrollView below EditText to give EditText the focus..But I haven\'t tried it, but it should work. Not neat though..2. To hide keyboard at activity startOnly one answer worked for me, which is provided by @Dyarish. And the solution is to use \nfocusableInTouchMode settings in xml for the layout containing the editText\'s. This did the trickAnyway I end up using Dyarish\'s answer in both cases. So I am awarding the bounty to him..Thanks all other friends\nwho tried to help me.. Adding this to your code android:focusableInTouchMode="true" will make sure that your keypad doesn\'t appear on startup for your edittext box. You want to add this line to your linear layout that contains the EditTextBox. You should be able to play with this to solve both your problems.  I have tested this. Simple solution. ie: In your app_list_view.xml file------------------ EDIT: To Make keyboard appear on startup -----------------------This is to make they Keyboard appear on the username edittextbox on startup. All I\'ve done is added an empty Scrollview to the bottom of the .xml file, this puts the first edittext into focus and pops up the keyboard. I admit this is a hack, but I am assuming you just want this to work. I\'ve tested it, and it works fine. If you are looking for a more eloquent solution, I\'ve found this question which might help you out, it is not as simple as the solution above but probably a better solution. I haven\'t tested it but it apparently works. I think it is similar to the solution you\'ve tried which didn\'t work for you though. Hope this is what you are looking for.Cheers!UPDATE 2I tried very hard and found out a solution ... whenever a new activity starts then keyboard cant open but we can use Runnable in onResume and it is working fine so please try this code and check...UPDATE 1add this line in your AppLogin.javaand this line in your AppList.javaafter this check your application if it is not working then add this line in your AndroidManifest.xml fileORIGINAL ANSWERfor hide keyboardfor show keyboardfor focus on EditTextwhere ed is EditTextTry this code,For Showing Softkeyboard - For Hiding SoftKeyboard - Hope this helps.Did you try InputMethodManager.SHOW_IMPLICIT in first window.and for hiding in second window use InputMethodManager.HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLYEDIT :\n If its still not working then probably you are putting it at the wrong place. Override onFinishInflate() and show/hide there.
