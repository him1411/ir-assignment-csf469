I seem to have come across several different ways to find the size of an array. What is the difference between these three methods?The first and third ways are the same: they evaluate an array in scalar context. I would consider this to be the standard way to get an array\'s size.The second way actually returns the last index of the array, which is not (usually) the same as the array size.First, the second is not equivalent to the other two. $#array returns the last index of the array, which is one less than the size of the array.The other two are virtually the same. You are simply using two different means to create scalar context. It comes down to a question of readability.I personally prefer the following:I find it clearer thanandThe latter looks quite clear alone like this, but I find that the extra line takes away from clarity when part of other code. It\'s useful for teaching what @array does in scalar context, and maybe if you want to use $size more than once.This gets the size by forcing the array into a scalar context, in which it is evaluated as its size:This is another way of forcing the array into a scalar context, since it\'s being assigned to a scalar variable:This gets the index of the last element in the array, so it\'s actually the size minus 1 (assuming indexes start at 0, which is adjustable in Perl although doing so is usually a bad idea):This last one isn\'t really good to use for getting the array size. It would be useful if you just want to get the last element of the array:Also, as you can see here on StackÂ Overflow, this construct isn\'t handled correctly by most syntax highlighters...All three give the same result if we modify the second one a bit:Example:To use the second way, add 1:The \xe2\x80\x9cPerl variable types\xe2\x80\x9d section of the perlintro documentation containsThe special variable $#array tells you the index of the last element of an array:You might be tempted to use $#array + 1 to tell you how many items there are in an array. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother. As it happens, using @array where Perl expects to find a scalar value (\xe2\x80\x9cin scalar context\xe2\x80\x9d) will give you the number of elements in the array:The perldata documentation also covers this in the \xe2\x80\x9cScalar values\xe2\x80\x9d section.If you evaluate an array in scalar context, it returns the length of the array. (Note that this is not true of lists, which return the last value, like the C comma operator, nor of built-in functions, which return whatever they feel like returning.) The following is always true:Some programmers choose to use an explicit conversion so as to leave nothing to doubt:Earlier in the same section documents how to obtain the index of the last element of an array.The length of an array is a scalar value. You may find the length of array @days by evaluating $#days, as in csh. However, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the length of the array; it\xe2\x80\x99s the subscript of the last element, which is a different value since there is ordinarily a 0th element.From perldoc perldata, which should be safe to quote:The following is always true:Just so long as you don\'t $#whatever++ and mysteriously increase the size or your array.The array indices start with 0.andYou can truncate an array down to nothing by assigning the null list () to it. The following are equivalent:Which brings me to what I was looking for which is how to detect the array is empty. I found it if $#empty == -1;There are various ways to print size of array. Here are the meanings of all:\nLets say our array is my @arr = (3,4);This is the right way to get size of arrays.$#arr gives the last index of an array. so if array is of size 10 then its last index would be 9.We are adding 1 here considering array as 0-indexed. But, if its not zero based then, this logic will fail.Above example prints 6, because we have set its initial index to 4. Now index would be 5 and 6, with elements 3 and 4 respectively.When an array is used in scalar context, then it returns the size of arrayActually method 3 and method 1 are same.To find the size of an array use the scalar keyword:To find out the last index of an array there is $# (Perl default variable). It gives the last index of an array. As an array starts from 0, we get the size of array by adding one to $#:Example:Output:
