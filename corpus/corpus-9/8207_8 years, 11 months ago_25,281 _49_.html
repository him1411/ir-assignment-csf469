I\'m thinking along the lines of the virtual world representation in Hackers.Uploading a virus from a Mac to an alien spacecraft in Independence Day. I am always bothered by the Infinite resolution of bitmaps. Take a digital picture. Zoom in so that it pixelates. Then they "sharpen" the image and voila! out of pixelation, the killer, thug, spy, license plate etc. appears out of digital magic.ARRRGH!!!!Visual basic GUI in CSI.  Pure pain.In polish soap opera "Brzydula", one of main characters was writing e-mail in MS Paint:In Mission Impossible, an electronic transfer of a big amount of money takes as long as a big file upload. It takes so long that it requires a progress bar...I hate how many movies and tv series equate hacking with \'password guessing\'. Apparently a good hacker is the one who can guess the password for a government mainframe computer in 4 or 5 attempts. And every time the hacker tries a password and fails, he somehow knows that he is \'closer\' to guessing the right one.My peeve:  How EVERY computer makes a sound for EVERY character displayed on the screen along - never mind flashing, for example, EVERY fingerprint on the screen when trying to \'match\' the print pulled off of some evidence.Can you imagine working in a room full of non-stop beeping computers?And if you\'re doing an investigation, wouldn\'t you be angry at the programmer who thought that the program should take the time to display all those fingerprints that DON\'T match?  I can see the cop thinking "Oh yes, keep me waiting while you show me everything I DON\'T want - why not just text me when you get a match?""Unix, I know this" - Lex from Jurrasic Park.Definitely the episode of NCIS where they play a duet on a computer keyboard.The lab technician was typing furiously to try to stop a hacker who  is attacking her computer in real-time. However, she is losing the fight, so her colleague joins her to help her out - by typing furiously on the same keyboard at the same time.Surely the keyboard isn\'t such a rare and mysterious technology that 90% of the viewing audience can\'t see that this is ridiculous?In "Enemy of the state", they have a store\'s security camera video.  Captured on the video is Will Smith walking with a bag.  They not only do the classic "zoom in and sharpen", but they have some super-advanced program that allows them to ROTATE the bag and see what the other side of the bag looked like and are then able to determine that he had a gameboy in the bag based on that shape.It\'s even more amazing when they do the same thing with satellite images.Dan Brown - Digital Fortress.....Basically every episode of CSI or CSI:Miami.Every time a tech is looking at a grainy digital photograph and their supervisor leans over their shoulder and says, "Adjust and enhance!"When you see a projection of a computer screen on a user\'s face. A crime against both computers AND physics!How every computer in the world will accepts English language full-sentence commands ("TRANSFER PAYROLL HALF-CENTS TO ACCOUNT OF JOE SMITH") provided they are typed in all-caps.Mr Scott whipping up the formula for \'Transparent Aluminum\' on an old mac classic from Star Trek IV: The voyage home.alt text http://www.hame.ca/blog2/pictures/scotty.jpgGood looking programmers.Example: Angelina Jolie as a the nerd hacker, in "Hackers"In Batman Returns, the caped crusader is soaring through the sewer in his bat-sewer-mobile and honing in on the Penguin\'s duck-mobile. As he approaches the target, the duckmobile shows up on his radar, which emits a "quack" every time the rotating needle passes the target.I never understood why Batman would take the time during the construction of this advanced amphibious assault vehicle to add a duck icon to the display, much less a quacking sound.Just the idea that hacking is something done in real-time.  Hackers, Swordfish, NCIS, and many others depict hackers sitting at their keyboard furiously typing away commands to the systems they\'re hacking (or at each other).  They don\'t seem to grok that the act of hacking is more like spending hours writing a script (or seconds downloading one) and then spending a few milliseconds running it.  It\'s not interactive!Anything from 24.  "I need to open a socket""Transfer it to my screen""Follow this protocol""Download it to my PDA""DAMMIT"Why do "search programs" have to rapidly display an image on the screen of every person (or whatever) in the database as it\'s searching?Trinity\'s use of nmap to look for vulnerabilities in a power station in Matrix Reloaded - oh wait, that was actually quite accurate.How about green Japanese characters scrolling vertically up the screen, leaving trails?"The Net" with Sandra Bullock is the first thing that comes to mind.How in TV- and movie-land, successfully logging in causes a huge modal window to pop up that says Real-time satellite imagery (in 24, Enemy of the State, etc.).  It\'s amazing that there is never a cloud in the sky.Swordfish! come on: a timed hack? gimme a breakThe way that computer systems often helpfully report which characters of a password or code you\'ve guessed correctly, making brute force attacks that much easier.The database containing convenient 3D models of every room in every house in the whole cityWell I hate it when nerds are portraited as people who know something about all electronic equipment and programs. Like in Die Hard 4.0 where they go into the powerplant, and the nerd presses 2 or 3 buttons on a computer system he have never seen before, and suddenly he knows exactly where they need to go. A lot of great examples of that around :POffice space - no one here gets that much freedom and respect!
