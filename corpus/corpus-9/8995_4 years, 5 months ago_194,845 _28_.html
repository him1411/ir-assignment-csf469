In an Android application, I want to display a custom list view in an AlertDialog. How can I do this?Used below code to display custom list in AlertDialogYou can use a custom dialog.Custom dialog layout. list.xml In your activityEdit:Using alertdialogcustom.xmlSnapAccording to the documentation, there are three kinds of lists that can be used with an AlertDialog:I will give an example of each below.The way to make a traditional single-choice list is to use setItems.There is no need for an OK button because as soon as the user clicks on a list item control is returned to the OnClickListener.The advantage of the radio button list over the traditional list is that the user can see what the current setting is. The way to make a radio button list is to use setSingleChoiceItems.I hard coded the chosen item here, but you could keep track of it with a class member variable in a real project.The way to make a checkbox list is to use setMultiChoiceItems.Here I hard coded the the which items in the list were already checked. It is more likely that you would want to keep track of them in an ArrayList<Integer>. See the documentation example for more details. You can also set the checked items to null if you always want everything to start unchecked.To test all of the examples above I just had a simple project with a single button than showed the dialog when clicked:Use the "import android.app.AlertDialog;" import and then you write As a beginner I would suggest you go through http://www.mkyong.com/android/android-custom-dialog-example/I\'ll rundown what it basically doesThis is too simple Isn\'t it smoother to make a method to be called after the creation of the EditText unit in an AlertDialog, for general use?
