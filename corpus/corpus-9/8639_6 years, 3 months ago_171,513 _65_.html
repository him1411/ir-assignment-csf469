I\'ve the following sample html, there is a DIV which has 100% width. It contains some elements. While performing windows re-sizing, the inner elements may be re-positioned, and the dimension of the div may change. I\'m asking if it is possible to hook the div\'s dimension change event? and How to do that? I currently bind the callback function to the jQuery resize event on the target DIV, however, no console log is outputted, see below:\nThere is a very efficient method to determine if a element\'s size has been changed.http://marcj.github.io/css-element-queries/This library has a class ResizeSensor which can be used for resize detection.  It uses an event-based approach, so it\'s damn fast and doesn\'t waste CPU time.Example:Please do not use the jQuery onresize plugin as it uses setTimeout() loop to check for changes. THIS IS INCREDIBLY SLOW AND NOT ACCURATE.Disclosure: I am directly associated with this library.You have to bind the resize event on the window object, not on a generic html element.You could then use this:and within the callback function you can check the new width of your div callingSo, the answer to your question is no, you can\'t bind the resize event to a div.A new standard for this is the Resize Observer api, available in Chrome 54 behind the experimental web platform features flag.Spec: https://wicg.github.io/ResizeObserverPolyfills: https://github.com/WICG/ResizeObserver/issues/3Chrome Issue: https://crbug.com/612962Chrome Flag: chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-featuresFirefox Issue: https://bugzil.la/1272409Safari Issue: http://wkb.ug/157743Browsers Support: http://caniuse.com/#feat=resizeobserverTake a look at this http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-resize/examples/resize/It has various examples. Try resizing your window and see how elements inside container elements adjusted.Example with js fiddle to explain how to get it work.\nTake a look at this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/sgsqJ/4/In that resize() event is bound to an elements having class "test" and also to the window object\nand in resize callback of window object $(\'.test\').resize() is called.e.g.The best solution would be to use the so-called Element Queries. However, they are not standard, no specification exists - and the only option is to use one of the polyfills/libraries available, if you want to go this way.The idea behind element queries is to allow a certain container on the page to respond to the space that\'s provided to it. This will allow to write a component once and then drop it anywhere on the page, while it will adjust its contents to its current size. No matter what the Window size is. This is the first difference that we see between element queries and media queries. Everyone hopes that at some point a specification will be created that will standardize element queries (or something that achieves the same goal) and make them native, clean, simple and robust. Most people agree that Media queries are quite limited and don\'t help for modular design and true responsiveness.There are a few polyfills/libraries that solve the problem in different ways (could be called workarounds instead of solutions though):I have seen other solutions to similar problems proposed. Usually they use timers or the Window/viewport size under the hood, which is not a real solution. Furthermore, I think ideally this should be solved mainly in CSS, and not in javascript or html. I found this library to work when MarcJ\'s solution didn\'t:https://github.com/sdecima/javascript-detect-element-resizeIt\'s very lightweight and detects even natural resizes via CSS or simply the HTML loading/rendering.Code sample (taken from the link):Long term, you will be able to use the ResizeObserver.Unfortunately it is not currently supported by default in many browsers.In the mean time, you can use function like the following.  Since, the majority of element size changes will come from the window resizing or from changing something in the DOM.  You can listen to window resizing with the window\'s resize event and you can listen to DOM changes using MutationObserver.Here\'s an example of a function that will call you back when the size of the provided element changes as a result of either of those events:You can use iframe or object using contentWindow or contentDocument on resize. Without setInterval or setTimeoutThe Javascript:JsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/qq8p470d/Only the window object generates a "resize" event.  The only way I know of to do what you want to do is to run an interval timer that periodically checks the size.Using Clay.js (https://github.com/zzarcon/clay) it\'s quite simple to detect changes on element size:My jQuery plugin enables the "resize" event on all elements not just the window.https://github.com/dustinpoissant/ResizeTriggeringThis blog post helped me efficiently detect size changes to DOM elements.http://www.backalleycoder.com/2013/03/18/cross-browser-event-based-element-resize-detection/How to use this code...Packaged code used by the example...Note:  AppConfig is a namespace/object I use for organizing reusable functions.  Feel free to search and replace the name with anything you would like.You can try the code in the following snippet, it covers your needs using plain javascript. (run the code snippet and click full page link to trigger the alert that the div is resized if you want to test it.). Based on the fact that this is a setInterval of 100 milliseconds, i would dare to say that my PC did not find it too much CPU hungry. (0.1% of CPU was used as total for all opened tabs in Chrome at the time tested.). But then again this is for just one div, if you would like to do this for a large amount of elements then yes it could be very CPU hungry.You could always use a click event to stop the div-resize sniffing anyway.You can check the fiddle alsoUPDATEUpdated Fiddleusing Bharat Patil answer simply return false inside the your bind callback to prevent maximum stack error see example below:This is pretty much an exact copy of the top answer, but instead of a link, it\'s just the part of the code that matters, translated to be IMO more readable and easier to understand.  A few other small changes include using cloneNode(), and not putting html into a js string.  Small stuff, but you can copy and paste this as is and it will work.The way it works is by making two invisible divs fill the element you\'re watching, and then putting a trigger in each, and setting a scroll position that will lead to triggering a scroll change if the size changes.All real credit goes to Marc J, but if you\'re just looking for the relevant code, here it is:Only Window.onResize exists in the specification, but you can always utilize IFrame to generate new Window object inside your DIV.Please check this answer. There is a new little jquery plugin, that is portable and easy to use. You can always check the source code to see how it\'s done.i thought it couldn\'t be done but then i thought about it, you can manually resize a div via style="resize: both;" in order to do that you ave to click on it so added an onclick function to check  element\'s height and width and it worked. With only 5 lines of pure javascript (sure it could be even shorter)\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/eNyyVN
