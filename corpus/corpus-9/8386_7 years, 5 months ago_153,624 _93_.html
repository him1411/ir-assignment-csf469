I am in need of a JavaScript function which can take a value and pad it to a given length (I need spaces, but anything would do). I found this:Code:Example:But I have no idea what the heck it is doing and it doesn\'t seem to work for me.I found this solution here and this is for me much much simpler:And here I made an extension to the string object:An example to use it:This will return a time in the format "15:30"If you are doing this repeatedly, for example to pad values in an array, and performance is a factor, the following approach can give you nearly a 100x advantage in speed (jsPerf) over other solution that are currently discussed on the inter webs. The basic idea is that you are providing the pad function with a fully padded empty string to use as a buffer. The pad function just appends to string to be added to this pre-padded string (one string concat) and then slices or trims the result to the desired length.For example, to zero pad a number to a length of 10 digits,To pad a string with whitespace, so the entire string is 255 characters,See the jsPerf test here.And this is faster than ES6 string.repeat by 2x as well, as shown by the revised JsPerf herehttp://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript_pad.htmlIt\'s a lot more readable.Here\'s a recursive approach to it. An example...Using the ECMAScript 6 method String#repeat, a pad function is as simple as:String#repeat is currently supported in Firefox and Chrome only. for other implementation, one might consider the following simple polyfill:The key trick in both those solutions is to create an array instance with a given size (one more than the desired length), and then to immediately call the join() method to make a string. The join() method is passed the padding string (spaces probably). Since the array is empty, the empty cells will be rendered as empty strings during the process of joining the array into one result string, and only the padding will remain. It\'s a really nice technique.Using the ECMAScript 6 method String#repeat and Arrow functions, a pad function is as simple as:jsfiddleedit:\nsuggestion from the comments:this way, it wont throw an error when s.lengthis greater than nedit2:\nsuggestion from the comments:this way, you can use the function for strings and non-strings alike.pad with default valuesI noticed that i mostly need the padLeft for time conversion / number paddingso i wrote this functionThis simple function supports Number or String as inputdefault pad is 2 charsdefault char is 0so i can simply writeif i add the second argument (pad width)third parameter (pad char)EDIT\n@BananaAcid\nif you pass a undefined value or a 0 length string you get 0undefined..so:as suggestedbut this can also be achieved in a shorter way.works also with:And if you want to be able to pad in both ways :which can be written in a shorter way without using slice.now if you try to pad \'averylongword\' with 2 ... thats not my problem.Said that i give you a tip.Most of the time if you pad you do it for the same value N times.Using any type of function inside a loop slows down the loop!!!So if you just wanna pad left some numbers inside a long list don\'t use functions to do this simple thing.use something like this:if you don\'t know how the max padding size based on the numbers inside the array.String.prototype.padStart() and String.prototype.padEnd() are currently TC39 candidate proposals: see github.com/tc39/proposal-string-pad-start-end (only available in Firefox as of April 2016; a polyfill is available).With ES8, there are two options for padding.You can check them in the documentation.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padEndhttps://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStartHere\'s a simple function that I use.For example:Taking up Samuel ideas, upward here. And remember an old SQL script, I tried with this:It works in all the cases I could imagine:es7 is just drafts and proposals right now, but if you wanted to track compatibility with the spec, your pad functions need:From my polyfill library, but apply your own due diligence for prototype extensions.Here is a simple answer in basically one line of code.Make sure the number of characters in you padding, zeros here, is at least as many as your intended minimum length. So really, to put it into one line, to get a result of "00035" in this case is:Array manipulations are really slow compared to simple string concat. Of course, benchmark for your use case.A variant of @Daniel LaFavers\' answer.For example:I think its better to avoid recursion because its costly.\nECMAScript 2017 adds a padStart method to the String prototype. This method will pad a string with spaces to a given length. This method also takes an optional string that will be used instead of spaces for padding.For browser compatibility (and a useful polyfill) see this link.Here is a JavaScript function that adds specified number of paddings with custom symble. the function takes three parameters. \nAnd then you can do:If you just want a very simple hacky one-liner to pad, just make a string of the desired padding character of the desired max padding length and then substring it to the length of what you want to pad.  Example: padding the string store in e with spaces to 25 characters long.Result: "hello                    "If you want to do the same with a number as input just call .toString() on it before.It\'s 2014, and I suggest a Javascript string-padding function. Ha!Bare-bones: right-pad with spacesFancy: pad with optionsUsage (fancy):If you don\'t mind including a utility library, lodash library has _.pad, _.padLeft and _.padRight functions.A friend asked about using a JavaScript function to pad left. It turned into a little bit of an endeavor between some of us in chat to code golf it. This was the result:It ensures that the value to be padded is a string, and then if it isn\'t the length of the total desired length it will pad it once and then recurse. Here is what it looks like with more logical naming and structureThe example we were using was to ensure that numbers were padded with 0 to the left to make a max length of 6. Here is an example set:A short way:Example:return: "001234"Here\'s my takeI\'m not so sure about it\'s performance, but I find it much more readable than other options I saw around here...Based on the best answers of this question I have made a prototype for String called padLeft (exactly like we have in C#):Usage:JsFiddleTry this:-
