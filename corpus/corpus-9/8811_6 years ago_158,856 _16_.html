I can\'t find the namespace to use for [DataContract] and [DataMember] elements. According to what I\'ve found, it seems that adding the following should be enough, but in my case it is not.Here is a snippet of my code:And the error I get:The type or namespace name \'DataContract\' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)Am I not using the right namespaces?DataContractAttribute Class is in the System.Runtime.Serialization namespace.But you should add reference to System.Runtime.Serialization.dllAnd assembly isn\'t referenced by default, so you have to go to References -> Add Reference in Solution Explorer and add an assembly referencehttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.datacontractattribute.aspxDataContractAttribute is in System.Runtime.Serialization namespace and you should reference System.Runtime.Serialization.dll. It\'s only available in .Net >= 3[DataContract] and [DataMember] attribute are found in System.ServiceModel namespace which is in System.ServiceModel.dll .System.ServiceModel uses the System and System.Runtime.Serialization namespaces to serialize the datamembers.In visual studio for .Net 4.0 framework, First, I add the references to my Model, then I use them in my code. There are two references you should add:using System.ServiceModel;\n  using System.Runtime.Serialization;then, this problem was solved in my program. I hope this answer can help you. Thanks.
