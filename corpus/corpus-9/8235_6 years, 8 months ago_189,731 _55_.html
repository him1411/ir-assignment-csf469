Is it possible to check the overflow:auto of a div?For example:HTMLJQUERYSometimes is the content short (no scrollbar) and sometimes long (scrollbar visible).a little plugin for it.use it like this, tested working on Firefox, Chrome, IE6,7,8but not working properly on body tag selectorEditI found out that when you have horizontal scrollbar that causes vertical scrollbar to appear, this function does not work....I found out another solution... use clientHeightMaybe a more simple solution.I should change a little thing of what Reigel said:innerHeight counts control\'s height and its top and bottom paddingsThis expands on @Reigel\'s answer. It will return an answer for horizontal or vertical scrollbars.Example:You can do this using a combination of the Element.scrollHeight and Element.clientHeight attributes.According to MDN:The Element.scrollHeight read-only attribute is a measurement of the height of an element\'s content, including content not visible on the screen due to overflow. The scrollHeight value is equal to the minimum clientHeight the element would require in order to fit all the content in the viewpoint without using a vertical scrollbar. It includes the element padding but not its margin.And:The Element.clientHeight read-only property returns the inner height of an element in pixels, including padding but not the horizontal scrollbar height, border, or margin.clientHeight can be calculated as CSS height + CSS padding - height of horizontal scrollbar (if present).Therefore, the element will display a scrollbar if the scroll height is greater than the client height, so the answer to your question is:You need element.scrollHeight. Compare it with $(element).height().The first solution above works only in IE\nThe second solution above works only in FFThis combination of both functions works in both browsers:HTHI made a new custom :pseudo selector for jQuery to test whether an item has one of the following css properties: I wanted to find the closest scrollable parent of another element so I also wrote another little jQuery plugin to find the closest parent with overflow.This solution probably doesn\'t perform the best, but it does appear to work. I used it in conjunction with the $.scrollTo plugin. Sometimes I need to know whether an element is inside another scrollable container. In that case I want to scroll the parent scrollable element vs the window.I probably should have wrapped this up in a single plugin and added the psuedo selector as a part of the plugin, as well as exposing a \'closest\' method to find the closest (parent) scrollable container.Anywho....here it is.$.isScrollable jQuery plugin:$(\':scrollable\') jQuery pseudo selector:$.scrollableparent() jQuery plugin:Implementation is pretty simpleUPDATE: I found that Robert Koritnik already came up with a much more powerful :scrollable pseudo selector that will identify the scrollable axes and height of scrollable containers, as a part of his $.scrollintoview() jQuery plugin. scrollintoview pluginHere is his fancy pseudo selector (props):(scrollWidth/Height - clientWidth/Height) is a good indicator for the presence of a scrollbar, but it will give you a "false positive" answer on many occasions.\nif you need to be accurate i would suggest using the following function.\ninstead of trying to guess if the element is scrollable - you can scroll it...Here\'s my improvement: added parseInt. for some weird reason it didn\'t work without it.Ugh everyone\'s answers on here are incomplete, and lets stop using jquery in SO answers already please. Check jquery\'s documentation if you want info on jquery.Here\'s a generalized pure-javascript function for testing whether or not an element has scrollbars in a complete way:Here\'s an improved version of Evan\'s answer which seems to properly account for overflow logic.Works on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera, at least in the newer versions.Using JQuery...Setup this function to fix the footer:It returns a function. Made this way just to set the body and footer once.And then, set this when the document is ready.Add this to your footer css:The solutions provided above will work in the most cases, but checking the scrollHeight and overflow is sometimes not enough and fail for body and html elements:\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/EvzXZwThis solution checks if the element is scrollable:Note: elements with overflow=hidden are also treated as scrollable (more info), so you might add a condition against that too if needed:Explanation: The trick is, that the attempt of scrolling down and reverting it won\'t be rendered by the browser. The topmost function can also be written like the following:
