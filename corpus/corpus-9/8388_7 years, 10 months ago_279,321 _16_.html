I\'m using django with fastcgi + nginx. I want to know where the logs (error) are stored in this caseerrors are stored in nginx log file. you can specify it in root of nginx config file.I was looking for a different solution. Error logs, by default, before any config is set, on my system (x86 Arch), was found in:You can use lsof (list of open files) in most cases to find open logfiles without knowing the configuration:Example:find PID of httpd (same concept applies for nginx and other programs):Then search for open logfiles using lsof for the PID:you can read a little more hereRun this command, to check error logs:My ngninx logs are located here:You can also check your nginx.conf to see if you have any directives dumping to custom log. run nginx -t to locate your nginx.conf. Nginx is usually set up in /usr/local or /etc/. The server could be configured to dump logs to /var/log as well. If you have an alternate location for your nginx install and all else fails, you could use the find command to locate your file of choice.find /usr/ -path "*/nginx/*" -type f -name \'*.log\', where /usr/ is the folder you wish to start searching from.
