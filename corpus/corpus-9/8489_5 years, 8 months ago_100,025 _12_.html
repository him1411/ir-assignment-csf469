Given a change that has been committed using commit, and then reverted using revert, what is the best way to then undo that revert?Ideally, this should be done with a new commit, so as to not re-write history.If you haven\'t pushed that change yet, git reset --hard HEAD^Otherwise, reverting the revert is perfectly fine.Another way is to git checkout HEAD^^ -- . and then git add -A && git commit.git cherry-pick <original commit sha>\nWill make a copy of the original commit, essentially re-applying the commitReverting the revert will do the same thing, with a messier commit message:\ngit revert <commit sha of the revert>Either of these ways will allow you to git push without overwriting history, because it creates a new commit after the revert.\nWhen typing the commit sha, you typically only need the first 5 or 6 characters:\ngit cherry-pick 6bfabcIt is looks stupid for me. But I had been in the same situation and I did revert for reverted commits. I did number reverts so I had to do revert for each \'revert commit\'.Now my commits history looks a weird a bit.It is a pet project so it is OK. But for real-life project I would give preference to go to last commit before reverted restore all reverted code together in one commit and more reasonable comment.
