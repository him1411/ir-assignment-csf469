I have a list of key/value pairs of configuration values I want to store as Java property files, and later load and iterate through.Questions:You can pass an InputStream to the Property, so your file can pretty much be anywhere, and called anything.Iterate as:You can store the file anywhere you like. If you want to keep it in your jar file, you\'ll want to use Class.getResourceAsStream() or ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream() to access it. If it\'s on the file system it\'s slightly easier.Any extension is fine, although .properties is more common in my experienceLoad the file using Properties.load, passing in an InputStream or a StreamReader if you\'re using Java 6. (If you are using Java 6, I\'d probably use UTF-8 and a Reader instead of the default ISO-8859-1 encoding for a stream.)Iterate through it as you\'d iterate through a normal Hashtable (which Properties derives from), e.g. using keySet(). Alternatively, you can use the enumeration returned by propertyNames().If you put the properties file in the same package as class Foo, you can easily load it with Given that Properties extends Hashtable you can iterate over the values in the same manner as you would in a Hashtable.If you use the *.properties extension you can get editor support, e.g. Eclipse has a properties file editor.There are many ways to create and read properties files:ResourceBundle class:Properties class:This load the properties file:    I use to put the .properties file in a directory where I have all the configuration files, I do not put it together with the class that accesses it, but there are no restrictions here.For the name... I use .properties for verbosity sake, I don\'t think you should name it .properties if you don\'t want.Example:In order:By default, Java opens it in the working directory of your application (this behavior actually depends on the OS used). To load a file, do:As such, any file extension can be used for property file. Additionally, the file can also be stored anywhere, as long as you can use a FileInputStream.On a related note if you use a modern framework, the framework may provide additionnal ways of opening a property file. For example, Spring provide a ClassPathResource to load a property file using a package name from inside a JAR file. As for iterating through the properties, once the properties are loaded they are stored in the java.util.Properties object, which offer the propertyNames() method.Properties has become legacy. Preferences class is preferred to Properties.A node in a hierarchical collection of preference data. This class allows applications to store and retrieve user and system preference and configuration data. This data is stored persistently in an implementation-dependent backing store. Typical implementations include flat files, OS-specific registries, directory servers and SQL databases. The user of this class needn\'t be concerned with details of the backing store.Unlike properties which are String based key-value pairs,  The Preferences class has several methods used to get and put primitive data in the Preferences data store. We can use only the following types of data:To load the the properties file, either you can provide absolute path Or use getResourceAsStream() if the properties file is present in your classpath.xml file:Have a look at this article on internals of preferences storeReading a properties file and loading its contents to PropertiesThe following is the efficient way to iterate over a Properties1) It is good to have your property file in classpath but you can place it anywhere in project.Below is how you load property file from classpath and read all properties.2) Property files have the extension as .propertiesIn Java 8 to get all your properties Here is another way to iterate over the properties:I have written on this property framework for the last year.\nIt will provide of multiple ways to load properties, and have them strongly typed as well.Have a look at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jhpropertiestyp/JHPropertiesTyped will give the developer strongly typed properties.\nEasy to integrate in existing projects.\nHandled by a large series for property types.\nGives the ability to one-line initialize properties via property IO implementations.\nGives the developer the ability to create own property types and property io\'s. \nWeb demo is also available, screenshots shown above.\nAlso have a standard implementation for a web front end to manage properties, if you choose to use it. Complete documentation, tutorial, javadoc, faq etc is a available on the project webpage.
