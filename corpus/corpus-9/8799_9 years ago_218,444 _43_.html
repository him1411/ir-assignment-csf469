How do I convert a datetime string in local time to a string in UTC time?I\'m sure I\'ve done this before, but can\'t find it and SO will hopefully help me (and others) do that in future.Clarification:  For example, if I have 2008-09-17 14:02:00 in my local timezone (+10), I\'d like to generate a string with the equivalent UTC time: 2008-09-17 04:02:00.Also, from http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/7/15/eppur-si-muove/, note that in general this isn\'t possible as with DST and other issues there is no unique conversion from local time to UTC time.First, parse the string into a naive datetime object. This is an instance of datetime.datetime with no attached timezone information. See documentation for datetime.strptime for information on parsing the date string.Use the pytz module, which comes with a full list of time zones + UTC. Figure out what the local timezone is, construct a timezone object from it, and manipulate and attach it to the naive datetime.Finally, use datetime.astimezone() method to convert the datetime to UTC.Source code, using local timezone "America/Los_Angeles", for the string "2001-2-3 10:11:12":From there, you can use the strftime() method to format the UTC datetime as needed:The datetime module\'s utcnow() function can be used to obtain the current UTC time.As the link mentioned above by Tom: http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/7/15/eppur-si-muove/  says:UTC is a timezone without daylight saving time and still a timezone\n  without configuration changes in the past.Always measure and store time in UTC. If you need to record where the time was taken, store that separately. \n  Do not store the local time + timezone information!NOTE - If any of your data is in a region that uses DST, use pytz and take a look at John Millikin\'s answer.If you want to obtain the UTC time from a given string and your lucky enough to be in a region in the world that either doesn\'t use DST, or you have data that is only offset from UTC without DST applied:--> using local time as the basis for the offset value:--> Or, from a known offset, using datetime.timedelta():Thanks @rofly, the full conversion from string to string is as follows:My summary of the time/calendar functions:time.strptime\nstring --> tuple (no timezone applied, so matches string)time.mktime\nlocal time tuple --> seconds since epoch (always local time)time.gmtime\nseconds since epoch --> tuple in UTCand calendar.timegm\ntuple in UTC --> seconds since epochtime.localtime\nseconds since epoch --> tuple in local timezoneSource: http://feihonghsu.blogspot.com/2008/02/converting-from-local-time-to-utc.htmlExample usage from bd808: If your source is a datetime.datetime object t, call as:One more example with pytz, but includes localize(), which saved my day.Here\'s a summary of common Python time conversionsSource: taaviburns.caI\'m having good luck with dateutil (which is widely recommended on SO for other related questions):(Code was derived from this answer to Convert UTC datetime string to local datetime)I\'ve had the most success with python-dateutil:if you prefer datetime.datetime:You can do it with:How about - if seconds is None then it converts the local time to UTC time else converts the passed in time to UTC.For getting around day-light saving, etc.None of the above answers particularly helped me. The code below works for GMT.Using http://crsmithdev.com/arrow/This library makes life easy :)in this case ... pytz is best lib
