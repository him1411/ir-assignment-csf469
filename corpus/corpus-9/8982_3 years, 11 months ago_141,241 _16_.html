Update: Solution found. You can read it at the end of the post.I\'m trying to perform a POST request to a remote REST API using NSURLSession. The idea is to make a request with two parameters: deviceId and textContent.The problem is that those parameters are not recognized by the server. The server part works correctly because I\'ve sent a POST using POSTMAN for Google Chrome and it worked perfectly.This is the code I\'m using right now:I\'ve tried the same procedure with a NSURLSessionUploadTask:Any ideas?The problem with my approach was that I was sending the incorrect Content-Type header with all my requests. So the only change needed for the code to work correctly is to remove the Content-Type = application/json HTTP header. So the correct code would be this:If you need to post images along with other parameters using NSURLSession here you have an example:You could try using a NSDictionary for the params. The following will send the parameters correctly to a JSON server.Hope this helps (I\'m trying to sort a CSRF authenticity issue with the above - but it does send the params in the NSDictionary).Sometimes I have been getting some errors when you want to pass httpBody serialized to Data from Dictionary, which on most cases is due to the wrong encoding or malformed data due to non NSCoding conforming objects in the Dictionary.Depending on your requirements one easy solution would be to create a String instead of Dictionary and convert it to Data.
