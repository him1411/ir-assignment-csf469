How do parseInt() and Number() behave differently when converting strings to numbers?Well, they are semantically different, the Number constructor called as a function performs type conversion and parseInt performs parsing, e.g.:Keep in mind that if parseInt detects a leading zero on the string, it will parse the number in octal base, this has changed on ECMAScript 5, the new version of the standard, but it will take a long time to get in browser implementations (it\'s an incompatibility with ECMAScript 3), also parseInt will ignore trailing characters that don\'t correspond with any digit of the currently used base.The Number constructor doesn\'t detect octals:But it can handle numbers in hexadecimal notation, just like parseInt:In addition, a widely used construct to perform Numeric type conversion, is the Unary + Operator (p. 72), it is equivalent to using the Number constructor as a function:first two will give you better performance as it returns a primitive instead of an object.If you are looking for performance then probably best results you\'ll get with bitwise right shift "10">>0. Also multiply ("10" * 1) or not not (~~"10"). All of them are much faster of Number and parseInt.\nThey even have "feature" returning 0 for not number argument.\nHere are Performance tests.I always use parseInt, but beware of leading zeroes that will force it into octal mode.I found two links of performance compare among several ways of converting string to int.http://jsben.ch/#/zGJHMhttp://phrogz.net/js/string_to_number.html parseInt converts to a integer number, that is, it strips decimals. Number does not convert to integer.
