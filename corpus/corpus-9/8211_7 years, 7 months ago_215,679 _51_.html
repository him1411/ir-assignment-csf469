I can create and display a custom alert dialog just fine but even so I have android:layout_width/height="fill_parent" in the dialog xml it is only as big as the contents.What I want is dialog that fills the entire screen except maybe a padding of 20 pixel.\nThen the image that is part of the dialog would automatically stretch to the full dialog size with fill_parent.According to Android platform developer Dianne Hackborn in this discussion group post, Dialogs set their Window\'s top level layout width and height to WRAP_CONTENT.  To make the Dialog bigger, you can set those parameters to MATCH_PARENT.Demo code:Note that the attributes are set after the Dialog is shown. The system is finicky about when they are set.  (I guess that the layout engine must set them the first time the dialog is shown, or something.) It would be better to do this by extending Theme.Dialog, then you wouldn\'t have to play a guessing game about when to call setAttributes.  (Although it\'s a bit more work to have the dialog automatically adopt an appropriate light or dark theme, or the Honeycomb Holo theme.  That can be done according to http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/themes.html#SelectATheme )Specifying FILL_PARENT on the dialog window, like others suggested, did not work for me (on Android 4.0.4), because it just stretched the black dialog background to fill the whole screen.What works fine is using the minimum display value, but specifying it within the code, so that the dialog takes 90% of the screen.So:In general only adjusting the width should be sufficient in most cases.Set android:minWidth and android:minHeight in your custom view xml. These can force the alert not to just wrap content size. \nUsing a view like this should do it:Try wrapping your dialog custom layout into RelativeLayout instead of LinearLayout. That worked for me. All of the other answers here makes sense, but it did not meet what Fabian needs. Here is a solution of mine. It may not be the perfect solution but it works for me. It shows a dialog which is on fullscreen but you can specify a padding on top, bottom, left or right.First put this in your res/values/styles.xml :As you can see I have there android:paddingTop= 20dp is basically what you need. The android:windowBackground = @color/Black0Percent is just a color code declared on my color.xmlres/values/color.xmlThat Color code just serves as a dummy to replace the default window background of the Dialog with a 0% transparency color.Next build the custom dialog layout res/layout/dialog.xmlFinally here is our dialog that set custom view which uses our dialog.xml:Conclusion: I tried to override the dialog\'s theme in the styles.xml named CustomDialog. It overrides the Dialog window layout and gives me the chance to set a padding and change the opacity of the background. It may not be the perfect solution but I hope it helps you..:)Even simpler just do this:You can use percentage for (JUST) windows dialog width.Look into this example from Holo Theme:All you need to do is extend this theme and change the values for "Major" and "Minor" to 90% instead 65%.Regards.Solution with actual 90% calculation:where getScreenWidth(Activity activity) is defined the following (best put in a Utils class):Well, you have to set your dialog\'s height and width before to show this ( dialog.show() ) so, do something like this:The following worked fine for me:(note: windowMinWidthMajor/Minor as suggested in previous answers didn\'t do the trick. My dialogs kept changing sizes depending on the content)and then:Well, you have to set your dialog\'s height and width before to show this ( dialog.show() ) so, do something like this:Getting this code, i made it some changes:however, dialog size\'s could change when the device change its position. Perhaps you need to handle by your own when metrics changes.\nPD: peekDecorView, implies that layout in activity is properly initialized otherwise you may use in order to get screen sizeBy far the most simplest way I can think of -If your dialog is made out of a vertical LinearLayout, just add a "height filling" dummy view, that will occupy the entire height of the screen.For example -Notice the android:weightSum="1" in the LinearLayout\'s attributes and the android:layout_weight="1" in the dummy View\'s attributesMy answer is based on the koma\'s but it doesn\'t require to override onStart but only onCreateView which is almost always overridden by default when you create new fragments.I\'ve tested it on Android 5.0.1.Above many of the answers are good but none of the worked for me fully.  So i combined the answer from @nmr and got this one.After initialize your dialog object and set the content view. Do this and enjoy.(in the case i am setting 90% to width and 70% to height because width 90% it will be over toolbar )Here is my variant for custom dialog\'s width:So depending on device orientation (ThemeHelper.isPortrait(mContext)) dialog\'s width will be either 95% (for portrait mode) or 65% (for landscape). It\'s a little more that the author asked but it could be useful to someone.You need to create a class that extends from Dialog and put this code into your onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) method.For dialog\'s height the code should be similar to this.Here is a short answer that worked for me (Tested on API 8 and API 19).
