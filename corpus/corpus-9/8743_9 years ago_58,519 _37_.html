I have a string which is like this:I\'m trying to write something in Python to split it up by space while ignoring spaces within quotes. The result I\'m looking for is:PS. I know you are going to ask "what happens if there are quotes within the quotes, well, in my application, that will never happen.You want split, from the shlex module.This should do exactly what you want.Have a look at the shlex module, particularly shlex.split.I see regex approaches here that look complex and/or wrong.  This surprises me, because regex syntax can easily describe "whitespace or thing-surrounded-by-quotes", and most regex engines (including Python\'s) can split on a regex.  So if you\'re going to use regexes, why not just say exactly what you mean?:Explanation:shlex probably provides more features, though.Depending on your use case, you may also want to check out the csv module:Output: Since this question is tagged with regex, I decided to try a regex approach. I first replace all the spaces in the quotes parts with \\x00, then split by spaces, then replace the \\x00 back to spaces in each part.Both versions do the same thing, but splitter is a bit more readable then splitter2.I use shlex.split to process 70,000,000 lines of squid log, it\'s so slow. So I switched to re.Please try this, if you have performance problem with shlex.To get around the unicode issues in some Python 2 versions, I suggest:To preserve quotes use this function:Hmm, can\'t seem to find the "Reply" button... anyway, this answer is based on the approach by Kate, but correctly splits strings with substrings containing escaped quotes and also removes the start and end quotes of the substrings:This works on strings like \'This is " a \\\\\\"test\\\\\\"\\\\\\\'s substring"\' (the insane markup is unfortunately necessary to keep Python from removing the escapes).If the resulting escapes in the strings in the returned list are not wanted, you can use this slightly altered version of the function:The unicode issues with shlex discussed above (top answer) appear to be resolved (indirectly) in 2.7.2+ as per\nhttp://bugs.python.org/issue6988#msg146200(separate answer because I can\'t comment)I suggest:test string:to capture also "" and \'\':result:to ignore empty "" and \'\':result:If you don\'t care about sub strings than a simplePerformance:Or string modulePerformance: String module seems to perform better than string methodsOr you can use RE enginePerformanceFor very long strings you should not load the entire string into memory and instead either split the lines or use an iterative loopTry this:Some test strings:
