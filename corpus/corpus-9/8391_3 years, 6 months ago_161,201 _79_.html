When I try to install the Cryptography package for Python through either pip install cryptography or by downloading the package from their site and running python setup.py, I get the following error:I found other egg_info error posts (here and here) but the solutions there provided wouldn\'t solve my problem. Also, I am able to install other packages through PIP.PIP version 1.5.4 setuptools version 2.2I had a similar issue, and found i was simply missing a dependancy (libssl-dev, for me). As referenced in https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/, ensure that all dependancies are met:If you\xe2\x80\x99re on Windows you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to make sure you have OpenSSL installed. There are pre-compiled binaries available. If your installation is in an unusual location set the LIB and INCLUDE environment variables to include the\ncorresponding locations. For example:cryptography should build very easily on Linux provided you have a C compiler, headers for Python (if you\xe2\x80\x99re\nnot using pypy), and headers for the OpenSSL and libffi libraries available on your system.For Debian and Ubuntu, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:You should now be able to build and install cryptography with the usual.This is a condensed version of the information found on cryptography\'s installation docs page. Consult that page for the latest details.Since this SO question keeps coming up I\'ll drop a response here too (I am one of the pyca/cryptography developers). Here\'s what you need to reliably install pyca/cryptography on the 3 major platforms.Please note in all these cases it is highly recommended that you install into a virtualenv and not into the global package space. This is not specific to cryptography but rather is generic advice to keep your Python installation reliable. The global package space in OS provided Pythons is owned by the system and installing things via pip into it is asking for trouble.WindowsUpgrade to the latest pip (8.1.2 as of June 2016) and just pip install cryptographycryptography and cffi are both shipped as statically linked wheels.OS XUpgrade to the latest pip (8.1.2 as of June 2016) and just pip install cryptographycryptography and cffi are both shipped as statically linked wheels. This will work for pyenv Python, system Python, homebrew Python, etc. As long as you\'re on the latest pip you won\'t even need a compiler.LinuxAs of version 2.0 cryptography ships manylinux1 wheels. This means users with pip 8.1+ running on a glibc-based distribution (almost everything except Alpine Linux) and on x86/x86-64 (sorry Raspberry Pi people) no longer need a compiler or headers because you\'ll get a precompiled wheel automatically. So, first thing you should try is upgrading your pip!If you aren\'t manylinux1 compatible then here\'s what you need to do:You\'ll need a C compiler, libffi + its development headers, and openssl + its development headers. Debian or Ubuntu derived distributionsapt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev followed by pip install cryptographyRed Hat derived distributionsyum install gcc openssl-devel libffi-devel python-devel followed bypip install cryptographyFor those of you running OS X, here is what worked for me:(Running 10.9 Mavericks)You may also want to try merging the flags and pip commands to the following per the comment below:This worked for me in El CapitanYou can also check the thread here : https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/2350Apparently on recent versions of OSX this may be caused by Apple shipping their own version of OpenSSL, which doesn\'t work with the cryptography library. Recent versions of the cryptography library ship with their own native dependencies, but to get them you\'ll need to upgrade pip, and possibly also virtual env. So for me, the solution was:How I solved "Failed cleaning build dir for cryptography"\n(I came here from google to result for this error.)note: using a virtualenv my file /etc/apt/sources.list wasn\'t correctly configured for my debian 8.I wanted to install paramiko.\nparamiko needs cryptography.I got these errors:\nfirst with pip install cryptography:and then with sudo apt-get install build-essential :(Not exactly the same errors as OP but I\'m here to help eventually)After testing almost every command from every posts I end up going on\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList\nand copy pasted my adequate config in the file /etc/apt/sources.listthen:sudo aptitude updateand thensudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-devand thenpip install cryptographyhthThis solved the problem for me (Ubuntu 16.04):and then it was working like this:Nick Woodham\'s answer didn\'t work on OSX 10.11 El Capitan for me, but this did.This worked for me (I\'m using Ubuntu 14.04):first install libffi-dev libssl-dev libpython2.7-dev:then inside virtualenv:Sources: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32800685/5123544https://stackoverflow.com/a/29202163/5123544I was having a problem running sudo pip install cryptography because it would not find ffi when trying to compile. (OSX - Yosemite)I solved it by downloading libffi and setting up the env var.This works on El Capitan with MacPorts:If you are using python3, you need to install python3-dev. This fixed my problem sudo apt-get install python3-dev.I actually ran into this same prob trying to install Scrapy which depends on cryptography being installed first. I\'m on Win764-bit with Python 2.7 64-bit installed. @jsonm\'s answer eventually worked for me, but first I had to Copy C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\\VC\\bin\\vcvarsx86_amd64.bat to the x86_amd64 subdir within that bin dir so the vcvarsall.bat would stop throwing an error saying it was missing the config. If you need to configure env vars for a different setup, be sure to copy to corresponding vcvars bat file to the corresponding subdir or the first command below might not work.Then I ran the following from a commandline as per @jsonm\'s instructions (tweaked for my config)...  And it worked.I had this error too. After continuing to get this error even after installing openSSL, I eventually tried installing from wheel files from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cryptography/0.2.2#downloads. It worked!I noticed the original poster was clearly using a windows installation... and the best answers above are all for other OSs... so here goes. This assumes you have installed Python 2.7 which is the most widely supported (though old) version.Re-run pip install (package)  e.g. i downloaded paramiko full source code from pypi and didpython setup.py installit worked flawlesslyall default pythondev / openssl /libffi packages are already present in rhel.downloading rpms have rpm mismatch and more troubleI encountered a similar issue recently. In my case the versions of cffi and cryptography written in requirements.txt weren\'t compatible (cffi==1.8.9 and cryptography==1.9). I solved updating cffi with the last available version.I am having same problem:Then I install libffi-devel and problem is solvedThose two commands fixed it for me:Source: https://github.com/phusion/passenger/issues/1630#issuecomment-147527656
