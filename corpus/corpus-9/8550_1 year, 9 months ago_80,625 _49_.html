Error:Execution failed for task \':app:processDebugGoogleServices\'. Please\n  fix the version conflict either by updating the version of the\n  google-services plugin (information about the latest version is\n  available here)\n  or updating the version of com.google.android.gms to 8.3.0.I\'ve done all the things I\'ve found.And in the app gradleUse these dependencies for the project build.gradleand put this at the end of the app-level build.gradle file (after the dependencies). I have no clue why putting this at the end (and not at the beginning ) solves the error.EDIT 5/1/2016Ok\xe2\x80\xa6 So trying to put an end to all problems you guys have faced with my solutionThis is my final app level gradleand this is my final project level gradleCompare this with your own gradle files, and add or modify any values which are different from what I\'ve written.In the application\'s module (build.gradle)Moving :to the last line solved the issue.Do the following:Put the following in your build.gradle(Application level gradle file)Please check here for latest version as this keep on changing. Plugin is too old, please update to a more recent version, or set ANDROID_DAILY_OVERRIDE environment variablePut the following line at the bottom of your build.gradle(module level gradle file)This seems to be fixed with version 3.0.0 of Google Services plugin (and version 9.0.0 of the Google Play Services library). So with this top level build.gradleapp level build.gradleQuick Side Note: If you are updating to version 3.0.0 of the google-services plugin, make sure to regenerate your configuration file as it has new fields (explained here).Edit (2016-06-20): While this does compile and run, I just noticed that in the build logs it does specify to put the plugin at the bottom of the file, or the default (9.0.0) will be used. So in the situation above this isn\'t a problem since I am using version 9.0.0, but this can be problematic when updating the dependency. Here\'s the log: google-services plugin could not detect any version for com.google.android.gms or com.google.firebase, default version: 9.0.0 will be used.\nplease apply google-services plugin at the bottom of the build file.For me works only this:Top level.App level:found in official examplein project gradlein app gradleI have updated in app build.gradleand app build.gradleIts working for.In my caseI have removed the "apply plugin: \'com.google.gms.google-services\'"\nfrom the end of the gradle.build and its working fine.The important thing is to set Gradle to Version 2.10https://stackoverflow.com/a/35188079/570168I Was serching... at the Google page there is the solution...https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin#introductionAdd dependencies for basic libraries required for the services you have enabled. This step requires that the apply plugin: \'com.google.gms.google-services\' line be at the end of your app/build.gradle file so that no dependency collisions are introduced. You can see the result of this step by running ./gradlew :app:dependencies.There is no meaning in moving apply plugin: \'com.google.gms.google-services\' to the end of build.gradle. It is same as not defining it.Just remove this line and make sure apply plugin: \'com.android.application\' is thereUse:   it will compile.In project gradle in app/module gradleIn project gradle:It is working.Here is my instruction to fix it.
