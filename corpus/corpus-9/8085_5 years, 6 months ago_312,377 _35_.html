I am trying to do POST with HttpURLConnection(I need to use it this way, can\'t use HttpPost) and I\'d like to add parameters to that connection such aswherehaving some data stored in. I can\'t find a way how to add this ArrayList to my HttpURLConnection which is here:The reason for that awkward https and http combination is the need for not verifying the certificate. That is not a problem, though, it posts the server well. But I need it to post with arguments. Any ideas?You can get output stream for the connection and write the parameter query string to it....Since the NameValuePair is deprecated.

It may help others.You can use the method UrlEncodedFormEntity.writeTo(OutputStream).The accepted answer throws a ProtocolException at:OutputStream os = conn.getOutputStream();because it does not enable the output for the URLConnection object. The solution should include this:conn.setDoOutput(true);to make it work.If it\'s not too late, I\'d like to share my code Utils.java:MainActivity.java:There\'s a much easier approach using PrintWriter (see here)Basically all you need is:Try this:       You can add as many nameValuePairs as you need. And don\'t forget to mention the count in the list.AsyncTask to send data as JSONObect via POST MethodBy using org.apache.http.client.HttpClient also you can easily do this with more readable way as below.Within try catch you can insertTo call POST/PUT/DELETE/GET Restful methods with custom header or json data the following Async class can be usedAnd The Usage isI use something like this:In my case I have created function like this to make Post request which takes String url and hashmap of parametersthis is how i pass "params"(JSONObject) through POST
