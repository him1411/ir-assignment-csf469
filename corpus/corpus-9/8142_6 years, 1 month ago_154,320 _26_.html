I need to know the exact size of ActionBar in pixels so to apply correct background image.To retrieve the height of the ActionBar in XML, just useor if you\'re an ActionBarSherlock or AppCompat user, use thisIf you need this value at runtime, use thisIf you need to understand where this is defined:From the de-compiled sources of Android 3.2\'s framework-res.apk, res/values/styles.xml contains:3.0 and 3.1 seem to be the same (at least from AOSP)...To get the actual height of the Actionbar, you have to resolve the attribute actionBarSize at runtime. One of the Honeycomb samples refers to ?android:attr/actionBarSizeI needed to do replicate these heights properly in a pre-ICS compatibility app and dug into the framework core source. Both answers above are sort of correct.It basically boils down to using qualifiers. The height is defined by the dimension "action_bar_default_height"It is defined to 48dip for default. But for -land it is 40dip and for sw600dp it is 56dip.If you\'re using the compatibility ActionBar from the recent v7 appcompat support package, you can get the height usingDocumentationWith the new v7 support library (21.0.0) the name in R.dimen has changed to @dimen/abc_action_bar_default_height_material.When upgrading from a previous version of the support lib you should therefore use that value as the actionbar\'s heightIf you are using ActionBarSherlock, you can get the height with@AZ13\'s answer is good, but as per the Android design guidelines, the ActionBar should be at least 48dp high.The Class Summary is usually a good place to start. I think the getHeight() method should suffice. EDIT:If you need the width, it should be the width of the screen (right?) and that can be gathered like this.Screen ratio is : 8.3 : 100 example : if your screen is of 1024 pixel then 84 will be your action bar height .On my Galaxy S4 having > 441dpi > 1080 x 1920 > \nGetting Actionbar height with getResources().getDimensionPixelSize I got 144 pixels.Using formula px = dp x (dpi/160), I was using 441dpi, whereas my device lies  \nin the category 480dpi. so putting that confirms the result.I did in this way for myself, this helper method should come in handy for someone:
