Many times we need to auto-fit the font of the TextView to the boundaries given to it.Sadly, even though there are many threads and posts (and suggested solutions) talking about this problem (example here, here and here), none of them actually work well.That\'s why, I\'ve decided to test each of them till I find the real deal.I think that the requirements from such a textView should be:Should allow using any font, typeface, style, and set of characters.Should handle both width and heightNo truncation unless text cannot fit because of the limitation, we\'ve\ngiven to it (example: too long text, too small available size). However, we could request for horizontal/vertical scrollbar if we wish, just for those cases.Should allow multi-line or single-line. In case of multi-line, allow max & min lines.Should not be slow in computation. Using a loop for finding the best size? At least optimize it and don\'t increment your sampling by 1 each time.In case of multi-line, should allow to prefer resizing or using more lines, and/or allow to choose the lines ourselves by using the "\\n" character.I\'ve tried so many samples (including those of the links, I\'ve written about), and I\'ve also tried to modify them to handle the cases, I\'ve talked about, but none really work.I\'ve made a sample project that allows me to visually see if the TextView auto-fits correctly.Currently, my sample project only randomize the text (the English alphabet plus digits) and the size of the textView, and let it stay with single line, but even this doesn\'t work well on any of the samples I\'ve tried.Here\'s the code (also available here):Does anybody know of a solution for this common problem that actually work?Even a solution that has much less features that what I\'ve written about, for example one that has just a constant number of lines of text, and adjusts its font according to its size, yet never have weird glitches and having the text get too large/small compared to its available space.Since this is such an important TextView, I\'ve decided to publish a library, so that everyone could easily use it, and contribute to it, here.Thanks to MartinH\'s simple fix here, this code also takes care of android:drawableLeft, android:drawableRight, android:drawableTop and android:drawableBottom tags.My answer here should make you happy Auto Scale TextView Text to Fit within BoundsI have modified your test case:I am posting code here at per android developer\'s request:Final effect:Sample Layout file:And the Java code:Warning:Beware of this resolved bug in Android 3.1 (Honeycomb) though.I\'ve modified M-WaJeEh\'s answer a bit to take into account compound drawables on the sides.The getCompoundPaddingXXXX() methods return padding of the view + drawable space. See for example: TextView.getCompoundPaddingLeft()Issue:\nThis fixes the measurement of the width and height of the TextView space available for the text. If we don\'t take the drawable size into account, it is ignored and the text will end up overlapping the drawable.Updated segment adjustTextSize(String):Ok I have used the last week to massively rewrite my code to precisely fit your test. You can now copy this 1:1 and it will immediately work - including setSingleLine(). Please remember to adjust MIN_TEXT_SIZE and MAX_TEXT_SIZE if you\'re going for extreme values.Converging algorithm looks like this:And the whole class can be found here.The result is very flexible now. This works the same declared in xml like so:... as well as built programmatically like in your test.I really hope you can use this now. You can call setText(CharSequence text) now to use it by the way. The class takes care of stupendously rare exceptions and should be rock-solid. The only thing that the algorithm does not support yet is: But I have added extensive comments to help you build this if you wish to! Please note:If you just use this normally without limiting it to a single line then there might be word-breaking as you mentioned before. This is an Android feature, not the fault of the AutoFitText. Android will always break words that are too long for a TextView and it\'s actually quite a convenience. If you want to intervene here than please see my comments and code starting at line 203. I have already written an adequate split and the recognition for you, all you\'d need to do henceforth is to devide the words and then modify as you wish. In conclusion: You should highly consider rewriting your test to also support space chars, like so:This will produce very beutiful (and more realistic) results.\nYou will find commenting to get you started in this matter as well.Good luck and best regardsMy requirement is to I referred the link: Auto Scale TextView Text to Fit within Bounds (including comments) and also the DialogTitle.javaI found that the solution provided is nice and simple but it does not dynamically change the size of the text box. It works great when\nthe selected text length from the list view is greater in size than the existing text lenght in the ScalableTextView. When selected the text having length smaller than the existing text in the ScalableTextView, it do not increase the size of the text, showing the text in the smaller size. I modified the ScalableTextView.java to readjust the text size based on the text length. Here is my ScalableTextView.javaHappy Coding....Warning, bug in Android 3 (Honeycomb) and Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)Androids versions: 3.1 - 4.04 have a bug, that setTextSize() inside of TextView works only for the first time (first invocation).The bug is described in Issue 22493: TextView height bug in Android 4.0 and Issue 17343: button\'s height and text does not return to its original state after increase and decrease the text size on HoneyComb.The workaround is to add a newline character to text assigned to TextView before changing size:I use it in my code as follow:I add this "\\u3000" character on left and right of my text, to keep it centered. If you have it aligned to left then append to the right only. Of course it can be also embedded with AutoResizeTextView widget, but I wanted to keep fix code outside.There\'s now an official solution to this problem. Autosizing TextViews introduced with Android O are available in the Support Library 26 and is backwards compatible all the way down to Android 4.0.https://developer.android.com/preview/features/autosizing-textview.htmlI\'m not sure why https://stackoverflow.com/a/42940171/47680 which also included this information was deleted by an admin. Convert the text view to an image, and the scale the image within the boundaries.Here\'s an example on how to convert a view to an Image: Converting a view to Bitmap without displaying it in Android?The problem is, your text will not be selectable, but it should do the trick. I haven\'t tried it, so I\'m not sure how it would look (because of the scaling).Below is avalancha TextView with added functionality for custom Font.Usage:Don\'t forget to add: xmlns:foo="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto". Font should be in assets firectoryknown bugs:\nDoesn\'t work with Android 4.03 - fonts are invisible or very small (original avalancha doesn\'t work too)\nbelow is workaround for that bug: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21851239/2075875Try thisIf you are looking for something easier:Quick fix for the issue described by @MalachiaszI\'ve fixed the issue by adding custom support for this in the auto resize class:Just call yourView.setTextCompat(newTextValue) instead of yourView.setText(newTextValue)Maybe I\'m the last one answer here but I found a simple solution and it works as I expected.My solution: MAKE TEXT_VIEW INVISIBLE -> REDUCE SIZE UNTIL FIT PARENT -> THEN MAKE IT VISIBLE.Requirements: The TextView is WRAP_CONTENT width, not margin start or end to parent.Use this method after calling setText() of TextView.\nMaybe it costs 0.5 second to view.Try adding LayoutParams and MaxWidth and MaxHeight to the TextView. It will force the layout to respect the parent container and not overflow.Since Android O, it\'s possible to auto resize text in xml:https://developer.android.com/preview/features/autosizing-textview.htmlAndroid O allows you to instruct a TextView to let the text size\n  expand or contract automatically to fill its layout based on the\n  TextView\'s characteristics and boundaries. This setting makes it\n  easier to optimize the text size on different screens with dynamic\n  content.The Support Library 26.0 Beta provides full support to the autosizing\n  TextView feature on devices running Android versions prior to Android\n  O. The library provides support to Android 4.0 (API level 14) and\n  higher. The android.support.v4.widget package contains the\n  TextViewCompat class to access features in a backward-compatible\n  fashion.
