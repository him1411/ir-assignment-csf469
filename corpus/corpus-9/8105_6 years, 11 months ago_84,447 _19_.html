Is there a way to use a command like git ls-files to show only untracked files?The reason I\'m asking is because I use the following command to process all deleted files:I\'d like something similar for untracked files:I was able to find the -o option to git ls-files, but this isn\'t what I want because it also shows ignored files.  I was also able to come up with the following long and ugly command:It seems like there\'s got to be a better command I can use here.  And if there isn\'t, how do I create custom git commands?To list untracked files try:Nice alias for adding untracked files:Edit: For reference: git-ls-filesIf you just want to remove untracked files, do this:add x to that if you want to also include specifically ignored files.  I use git clean -dfx a lot throughout the day.You can create custom git by just writing a script called git-whatever and having it in your path.git add -A -n will do what you want. -A adds all untracked files to the repo, -n makes it a dry-run where the add isn\'t performed but the status output is given listing each file that would have been added.The accepted answer crashes on filenames with space. I cannot comment on it (low stackoverflow score so far), and I\'m at this point not sure how to update the alias command, so I\'ll put the improved version here:Everything is very simple\nTo get list of all untrucked files use command git status with option -u (--untracked-files)git status -uWhen looking for files to potentially add.  The output from git show does that but it also includes a lot of other stuff.  The following command is useful to get the same list of files but without all of the other stuff.This is useful when combined in a pipeline to find files matching a specific pattern and then piping that to git add.I think this will so the same thing as the original poster intended:git add .
