Is this correct?JavaScript\'s elseif is in the format "else if", e.g.:Just add a space:You could use this syntax which is functionally equivalent:This works because each condition is fully evaluated before comparison with the switch value, so the first one that evaluates to true will match and its branch will execute. Subsequent branches will not execute, provided you remember to use break.Note that strict comparison is used, so a branch whose condition is merely "truthy" will not be executed. You can cast a truthy value to true with double negation: !!condition.Easy, use spaceConditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is trueUse else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is falseUse else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is falseActually, I think technically when indented properly it should be: There is no else if.
