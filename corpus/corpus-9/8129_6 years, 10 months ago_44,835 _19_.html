I want to know the difference between ObservableCollection and BindingList because I\'ve used both to notify for any add/delete change in Source, but I actually do not know when to prefer one over the other.Why would I choose one of the following over the other?or An ObservableCollection can be updated from UI exactly like any collection. The true difference is rather straightforward:ObservableCollection<T> implements INotifyCollectionChanged which provides notification when the collection is changed (you guessed ^^)\nIt allows the binding engine to update the UI when the ObservableCollection is updated.However, BindingList<T> implements IBindingList.IBindingList provides notification on collection changes, but not only that. It provides a whole bunch of functionality which can be used by the UI to provide a lot more things than only UI updates according to changes, like:All these functionalities are not available in ObservableCollection<T>Another difference is that BindingList relays item change notifications when its items implement INotifyPropertyChanged. If an item raises a PropertyChanged event, the BindingList will receive it an raises a ListChangedEvent with ListChangedType.ItemChanged and OldIndex=NewIndex (if an item was replaced, OldIndex=-1). ObservableCollection doesn\'t relay item notifications.Note that in Silverlight, BindingList is not available as an option: You can however use ObservableCollections and ICollectionView (and IPagedCollectionView if I remember well).The practical difference is that BindingList is for WinForms, and ObservableCollection is for WPF.From a WPF perspective, BindingList isnt properly supported, and you would never really use it in a WPF project unless you really had to.One More big difference between ObservableCollection and BindingList that comes handy, and can be a bid decision factor on the topic :BindingList List Change Handler:ObservableCollection Collection change: Brief of Above: If a property of an item is changed in BindingList, the ListChanged event will give you complete details\n  of property(in PropertyDescriptor) and ObservableCollection won\'t give you that. In fact\n  ObservableCollection will not raise change event for a property\n  changed in an item.Above conclusion are in regards of INotifyPropertyChanged implemented in model classes. By default none raises the changed event if a property is changed in an item.
