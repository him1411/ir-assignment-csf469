I have an instance of a System.Drawing.Bitmap and would like to make it available to my WPF app in the form of a System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapImage.What would be the best approach for this?How about loading it from MemoryStream?Thanks to Hallgrim, here is the code I ended up with:I also ended up binding to a BitmapSource instead of a BitmapImage as in my original questionI know this has been answered, but here are a couple of extension methods (for .NET 3.0+) that do the conversion. :)and the NativeMethods class (to appease FxCop)It took me some time to get the conversion working both ways, so here are the two extension methods I came up with:The easiest thing is if you can make the WPF bitmap from a file directly.Otherwise you will have to use System.Windows.Interop.Imaging.CreateBitmapSourceFromHBitmap.I work at an imaging vendor and wrote an adapter for WPF to our image format which is similar to a System.Drawing.Bitmap.I wrote this KB to explain it to our customers:http://www.atalasoft.com/kb/article.aspx?id=10156And there is code there that does it.  You need to replace AtalaImage with Bitmap and do the equivalent thing that we are doing -- it should be pretty straightforward.My take on this built from a number of resources. https://stackoverflow.com/a/7035036 https://stackoverflow.com/a/1470182/360211You can just share the pixeldata between a both namespaces ( Media and Drawing) by writing a custom bitmapsource. The conversion will happen immediately and no additional memory will be allocated. If you do not want to explicitly create a copy of your Bitmap this is the method you want. I came to this question because I was trying to do the same, but in my case the Bitmap is from a resource/file. I found the best solution is as described in the following link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.imaging.bitmapimage.aspx
