I have a web directory /www and a folder in that directory called store.Within store are several files and folders. I want to give the folder store and all files and folders within the store folder all permissions. How do I do this? I am guessing via .htaccess.If you are going for a console command it would be: chmod -R 777 /www/store. The -R makes it recursive.If by all permissions you mean 777Navigate to folder andBut I would suggest not to give 777 permission to all folder and it\'s all contents. You should give specific permission to each sub-folder in www directory folders.Each number have meaning in permission. Do not give full permissions.If your production web folder have multiple users, then you can set permissions and user groups accordingly. More infoYou can also use chmod 777 * This will give permissions to all files currently in the folder and files added in the future without giving permissions to the directory itself.NOTE: This should be done in the folder where the files are located. For me it was an images that had an issue so I went to my images folder and did this.Yes very right that the -R option in chmod command makes the files/ sub-directories under the given directory will get 777 permission. But generally its not a good practice to give 777 to all files and dirs as it can lead to data in-security. Try to be very specific on giving the all rights to all files and directories.\nand to answer your question:-\nchmod -R 777 your_directory_name \nwill work.Kuldip Singh Behal for mac, should be a \xe2\x80\x98superuser do\xe2\x80\x99;so first :and then
