Trying to getto go directly toI have tried multiple bits of code and none work.What I\'ve tried:What am I doing wrong?You can use a rewrite rule that uses ^$ to represent the root and rewrite that to your /store directory, like this:Try this:If you want an external redirect (which cause the visiting browser to show the redirected URL), set the R flag there as well:I was surprised that nobody mentioned this:Basically, it redirects the root and only the root URL.\nThe answer originated from this linkHere is what I used to redirect to a subdirectory. This did it invisibly and still allows through requests that match an existing file or whatever. Change out site.com and subdir with your values. Another alternative if you want to rewrite the URL and hide the original URL:With this, if you for example type http://www.example.com/product.php?id=4, it will transparently open the file at http://www.example.com/store/product.php?id=4 but without showing to the user the full url.To set an invisible redirect from root to subfolder, You can use the following RewriteRule in /root/.htaccess :The rule above will internally redirect the browser from :toAndtowhile the browser will stay on the root folder.This seemed the simplest solution:I was getting redirect loops with some of the other solutions. I don\'t understand your question...If you want to redirect every request to a subfolder:If you want to redirect to a subfolder which has the domain nameI have found that in order to avoid circular redirection, it is important to limit the scope of redirection to root directory.\nI would have used:Most of the above solutions are correct but they are all missing the transparency of the redirection.In my case, when visiting www.example.com I wanted to get redirected to the subdirectory /store but without updating the URL to www.example.com/store. (all I want is to get the page code form that directory). If that is your case the solution below works perfectly.source: http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Transparently_redirect_your_root_directory_to_a_subdirectoryI think the main problems with the code you posted are:the first line matches on a host beginning with strictly sample.com, so www.sample.com doesn\'t match.the second line wants at least one character, followed by www.sample.com which also doesn\'t match (why did you escape the first w?)none of the included rules redirect to the url you specified in your goal (plus, sample is misspelled as samle, but that\'s irrelevant).For reference, here\'s the code you currently have:Formerly I use the following code which is work correctly to redirect root URL of each of my domains/subdomains to their correspondence subdirectories which are named exactly as the sub/domain it self as below:However when I want to add another subs or domains then it will need to be added in the above code. It should be much more convenient to simplify it to work like  wildcard (*) as below:So whenever another subdomains/domains is added as long as the subdomain name has a prefix of sub (like: sub3.domain1.com, sub1.domain3.com etc.) the code will remain valid.One can use Redirect too for this purposeOr Alias for mappingEdit: mod_alias is only applicable in httpd.conf.RefrencesA little googling, gives me these results:RewriteEngine On RewriteBase\n  / RewriteRule ^index.(.*)?$\n  http://domain.com/subfolder/\n  [r=301]This will redirect any attempt to\n  access a file named index.something to\n  your subfolder, whether the file\n  exists or not.Or try this:RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}\n  !^www.sample.com$ [NC]\n  RewriteRule ^(.*)$\n  %{HTTP_HOST}/samlse/$1 [R=301,L]I haven\'t done much redirect in the .htaccess file, so I\'m not sure if this will work.try to use below lines in htaccess Note: you may need to check what is the name of the default.htmldefault.html is the file that load by default in the root folder.RewriteEngineRedirect /default.html http://example.com/store/Two ways out of possible solutions to achieve this are:\n1. Create a .htaccess file in root folder as under (just replace example.com and my_dir with your corresponding values):Use RedirectMatch to only redirect the root URL \xe2\x80\x9c/\xe2\x80\x9d to another folder or URL,RedirectMatch ^/$ http://www.example.com/my_diryou just add this code into your .htaccess file
