I am working on a WordPress site where the authors usually embed Google Maps using iFrames in most posts.Is there a way to disable the zoom via mouse scroll wheel on all of them using Javascript?I was having the same problem: when scrolling the page then the pointer becomes over the map, it starts to zoom in/out the map instead of continuing scrolling the page. :(So I solved this putting a div with an .overlay exactly before each gmap iframe insertion, see:In my CSS i created the class:The div will cover the map, preventing pointer events from getting to it. But if you click on the div, it becomes transparent to pointer events, activating the map again!I hope get helped you :)I tried the first answer in this discussion and it wasn\'t working for me no matter what I did so I came up with my own solution:Wrap the iframe with a class (.maps in this example) and ideally embedresponsively code: http://embedresponsively.com/ \xe2\x80\x94 Change the CSS of the iframe to pointer-events: none and then using jQuery\'s click function to the parent element you can change the iframes css to pointer-events:autoHTMLCSSjQueryI\'m sure there\'s a JavaScript only way of doing this, if someone wants to add to this feel free.The JavaScript way to reactivate the pointer-events is pretty simple. Just give an Id to the iFrame (i.e. "iframe"), then apply an onclick event to the cointainer div: I extended @nathanielperales solution.Below the behavior description:Below the javascript code:And here is an jsFiddle example.I\'m re-editing the code written by #nathanielperales it really worked for me. Simple and easy to catch but its work only once. So I added mouseleave() on JavaScript. Idea adapted from #Bogdan  And now its perfect. Try this. Credits goes to #nathanielperales and #Bogdan. I just combined both idea\'s. Thank you guys. I hope this will help others also...HTMLCSSjQueryImprovise - Adapt - OvercomeAnd here is an jsFiddle example.Yes its quite easy. I faced a similar problem. Just add the css property "pointer-events" to the iframe div and set it to \'none\'.Example:<\n    iframe style="pointer-events:none" src= ........ >SideNote: This fix would disable all other mouse events on the map. It worked for me since we didnt require any user interaction on the map. After doing some research you have 2 options. Since new maps api with iframe embed does not seem to support disabling of mousewheel.First would be using old google maps ( https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3045828?hl=en ).Second would be creating a javascript function to simplify embeding of a map for each comment and using parameters (it\'s sample code only to point location not show exact solution)There is an awesome and easy solution.You need to add a custom class in your css that sets the pointer events to map canvas to none:Then, with jQuery, you can add and remove that class based on different events, for example:    I have created an example in jsfiddle, hope that helps!I just register one account on developers.google.com and get a token for call a Maps API, and just disable that like this (scrollwheel: false):This is my approach. I find it easy to implement on various websites and use it all the timeCSS and JavaScript:In the HTML, you will want to wrap the iframe in a div.\n<div id="map" class="scrolloff" onclick="scrollOn()" onmouseleave="scrollOff()" >Hope this helps anyone looking for a simple solution.Here is a simple solution. Just set the pointer-events: none CSS to the <iframe> to disable mouse scroll.If you want the mouse scroll to be activated when the user clicks into the map, then use the following JS code. It will also disable the mouse scroll again, when the mouse moves out of the map.To disable mouse scroll wheel zoom on embedded Google Maps, you just need to set the css property pointer-events of the iframe to none:Thats All.. Pretty neat huh?Well, for me the best solution was to simply use like this:HTML:CSS:JS:RESULTConsiderations:The best would be to add an overlay with a darker transparency with a text: "Click to browse" when mouse wheel is deactivated\nBut when it is activated (after you click on it) then the transparency with text would disappear and the user could browse the map as expected.\nAny clues how to do that?Add style pointer-events:none; this working fineThe simplest way to do it is by using a pseudo-element like :before or :after. \nThis method will not require any additional html elements or jquery.\nIf we have for instance this html structure:Then all we need to do is make the wrapper relative to the pseudo-element we will create to prevent the scrolling After this we will create the pseudo-element that will be positioned over the map therefor preventing the scrolling:And you\'re done, no jquery no extra html elements!\nHere is a working jsfiddle example: http://jsfiddle.net/e6j4Lbe1/Here is my simple solution.Put your iframe in a div with a class called "maps" for example.This will be the CSS for your iframeAnd here is a little javascript that will set the pointer-events property of the iframe to "auto" when you hover the div element for at least 1 second (works best for me - set it to whatever you like) and clears the timeout/set it to "none" again when the mouse leaves the element.Cheers.I`ve created a very simple jQuery plugin to resolve the problem.\nCheck it at https://diazemiliano.github.io/googlemaps-scrollpreventUsing answer from @nathanielperales i\'ve added hover function cause for me it works better when user loses focus on map to stop scrolling again :) Variations on a theme: a simple solution with jQuery, no CSS editing needed.Hover listener is attached to the parent element, so if the current parent is bigger, you can just simply wrap the iframe with a div before the 3rd line.Hope it\'ll be useful for somebody.I stumbled upon this issue myself and used some of a mashup of two very useful answers on this question: \nczerasz\'s answer and massa\'s answer.They both have a lot of truth, but somewhere in my tests, I found out that one didn\'t work for mobile and had poor IE support (only works on IE11). This is the solution by nathanielperales, then extended by czerasz, which relies on pointer-events css and that doesn\'t work on mobile (there is no pointer in mobile) and it doesn\'t work on any version of IE that is not v11. Normally I wouldn\'t care less, but there are a ton of users out there and we want consistent functionality, so I went with the overlay solution, using a wrapper to make it easier to code. So, my markup looks like this:Then the styles are like this:Lastly the script:I also added my tested solution in a GitHub gist, if you like to get stuff from there...This is a solution with CSS and Javascript (ie. Jquery but works also with pure Javascript).  At the same time the map is responsive. Avoid map to zoom when scrolling, but map can be activated by click in it.HTML/JQuery JavascriptCSSHave fun !In Google Maps v3 you can now disable scroll to zoom, which leads to a much better user experience. Other map functions will still work and you don\'t need extra divs. I also thought there should be some feedback for the user so they can see when scrolling is enabled, so I added a map border.This will give you a responsive Google Map that will stop the scrolling on the iframe, but once clicked on will let you zoom.Copy and paste this into your html but replace the iframe link with your own. He\'s an article on it with an example: Disable the mouse scroll wheel zoom on embedded Google Map iframesThe simplest one:Add this to your script:Here would be my approach to this.Pop this into my main.js or similar file:Then simply insert an empty div where you want the map to appear on your page.<div id="map"></div>You will obviously need to call in the Google Maps API as well. I simply created a file called mapi.js and threw it in my /js folder. This file needs to be called before the above javascript.When you call the mapi.js file be sure you pass it the sensor false attribute.ie: <script type="text/javascript" src="js/mapi.js?sensor=false"></script>The new version 3 of the API requires the inclusion of sensor for some reason. Make sure you include the mapi.js file before your main.js file.For google maps v2  - GMap2:if you have an iframe using Google map embedded API like this :you can add this css style: pointer-event:none;\nES.Here\'s my take on the @nathanielperales answer extended by @chams, now extended again by me.HTMLjQueryHere is my solution for the problem, I was building a WP site, so there is a little php code here. But the key is scrollwheel: false, in the map object. Hope this will help.\nCheers
