I want to know which is faster: XML and JSON?\nWhen to use which one ?Before answering when to use which one, a little background:edit: I should mention that this comparison is really from the perspective of using them in a browser with JavaScript. It\'s not the way either data format has to be used, and there are plenty of good parsers which will change the details to make what I\'m saying not quite valid.JSON is both more compact and (in my view) more readable - in transmission it can be "faster" simply because less data is transferred.In parsing, it depends on your parser. A parser turning the code (be it JSON or XML) into a data structure (like a map) may benefit from the strict nature of XML (XML Schemas disambiguate the data structure nicely) - however in JSON the type of an item (String/Number/Nested JSON Object) can be inferred syntactically, e.g:The parser doesn\'t need to be intelligent enough to realise that 12 represents a number, (and Danielle is a string like any other). So in javascript we can do:In XML we\'d have to do something like the following:(as an aside, this illustrates the point that XML is rather more verbose; a concern for data transmission). To use this data, we\'d run it through a parser, then we\'d have to call something like:Actually, a good parser might well type the age for you (on the other hand, you might well not want it to). What\'s going on when we access this data is - instead of doing an attribute lookup like in the JSON example above - we\'re doing a map lookup on the key name. It might be more intuitive to form the XML like this:But we\'d still have to do map lookups to access our data:EDIT: Original: In most programming languages (not all, by any stretch) a map lookup such as this will be more costly than an attribute lookup (like we got above when we parsed the JSON).This is misleading: remember that in JavaScript (and other dynamic languages) there\'s no difference between a map lookup and a field lookup. In fact, a field lookup is just a map lookup.If you want a really worthwhile comparison, the best is to benchmark it - do the benchmarks in the context where you plan to use the data.As I have been typing, Felix Kling has already put up a fairly succinct answer comparing them in terms of when to use each one, so I won\'t go on any further.Faster is not an attribute of JSON or XML or a result that a comparison between those would yield. If any, then it is an attribute of the parsers or the bandwidth with which you transmit the data.Here is (the beginning of) a list of advantages and disadvantages of JSON and XML:Pro:Con:Pro:Con:So in the end you have to decide what you need. Obviously both formats have their legitimate use cases. If you are mostly going to use JavaScript then you should go with JSON.Please feel free to add pros and cons. I\'m not an XML expert ;)Processing speed may not be the only relevant matter, however, as that\'s the question, here are some numbers in a benchmark: JSON vs. XML: Some hard numbers about verbosity. For the speed, in this simple benchmark, XML presents a 21% overhead over JSON.An important note about the verbosity, which is as the article says, the most common complain: this is not so much relevant in practice (neither XML nor JSON data are typically handled by humans, but by machines), even if for the matter of speed, it requires some reasonable more time to compress.Also, in this benchmark, a big amount of data was processed, and a typical web application won\'t transmit data chunks of such sizes, as big as 90MB, and compression may not be beneficial (for small enough data chunks, a compressed chunk will be bigger than the uncompressed chunk), so not applicable.Still, if no compression is involved, JSON, as obviously terser, will weight less over the transmission channel, especially if transmitted through a WebSocket connection, where the absence of the classic HTTP overhead may make the difference at the advantage of JSON, even more significant.After transmission, data is to be consumed, and this count in the overall processing time. If big or complex enough data are to be transmitted, the lack of a schema automatically checked for by a validating XML parser, may require more check on JSON data; these checks would have to be executed in JavaScript, which is not known to be particularly  fast, and so it may present an additional overhead over XML in such cases.Anyway, only testing will provides the answer for your particular use\xe2\x80\x91case (if speed is really the only matter, and not standard nor safety nor integrity\xe2\x80\xa6).Update 1: worth to mention, is EXI, the binary XML format, which offers compression at less cost than using Gzip, and save processing otherwise needed to decompress compressed XML. EXI is to XML, what BSON is to JSON. Have a quick overview here, with some reference to efficiency in both space and time: EXI: The last binary standard?.Update 2: there also exists a binary XML performance reports, conducted by the W3C, as efficiency and low memory and CPU footprint, is also a matter for the XML area too: Efficient XML Interchange Evaluation.Worth to be noticed in this context, as HTTP overhead was raised as an issue: the IANA has registered the EXI encoding (the efficient binary XML mentioned above), as a a Content Coding for the HTTP protocol (alongside with compress, deflate and gzip). This means EXI is an option which can be expected to be understood by browsers among possibly other HTTP clients. See Hypertext Transfer Protocol Parameters\xc2\xa0(iana.org).The XML (extensible Markup Language) is used often XHR because this is a standard broadcasting language, what can be used by any programming language, and supported both server and client side, so this is the most flexible solution. The XML can be separated for more parts so a specified group can develop the part of the program, without affecting the other parts. The XML format can also be determined by the XML DTD or XML Schema (XSL) and can be tested.The JSON a data-exchange format which is getting more popular as the JavaScript applications possible format. Basically this is an object notation array. JSON has a very simple syntax so can be easily learned. And also the JavaScript support parsing JSON with the eval function. On the other hand, the eval function has got negatives. For example, the program can be very slow parsing JSON and because of security the eval can be very risky. This not mean that the JSON is not good, just we have to be more careful.My suggestion is that you should use JSON for applications with light data-exchange, like games. Because you don\'t have to really care about the data-processing, this is very simple and fast.The XML is best for the bigger websites, for example shopping sites or something like this. The XML can be more secure and clear. You can create basic data-struct and schema to easily test the correction and separate it into parts easily.I suggest you use XML because of the speed and the security, but JSON for lightweight stuff.The important thing about JSON is to keep data transfer encrypted for security reasons. No doubt that JSON is much much faster then XML. I have seen XML take 100ms where as JSON only took 60ms. JSON data is easy to manipulate.I found this article at digital bazaar really interesting. Quoting their quotations from Norm:About JSON pros:If all you want to pass around are atomic values or lists or hashes of\n  atomic values, JSON has many of the advantages of XML: it\xe2\x80\x99s\n  straightforwardly usable over the Internet, supports a wide variety of\n  applications, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to write programs to process JSON, it has few\n  optional features, it\xe2\x80\x99s human-legible and reasonably clear, its design\n  is formal and concise, JSON documents are easy to create, and it uses\n  Unicode.  ...About XML pros:XML deals remarkably well with the full richness of unstructured\n  data. I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried about the future of XML at all even if its death\n  is gleefully celebrated by a cadre of web API designers.And I can\xe2\x80\x99t resist tucking an "I told you so!" token away in my\n  desk. I look forward to seeing what the JSON folks do when they are\n  asked to develop richer APIs. When they want to exchange less well\n  strucured data, will they shoehorn it into JSON? I see occasional\n  mentions of a schema language for JSON, will other languages follow?\n  ...I personally agree with Norm. I think that most attacks to XML come from Web Developers for typical applications, and not really from integration developers. But that\'s my opinion! ;)
