How do I convert int[] into List<Integer> in Java?Of course, I\'m interested in any other answer than doing it in a loop, item by item. But if there\'s no other answer, I\'ll pick that one as the best to show the fact that this functionality is not part of Java.There is no shortcut for converting from int[] to List<Integer> as Arrays.asList does not deal with boxing and will just create a List<int[]> which is not what you want. You have to make a utility method.Also from guava libraries... com.google.common.primitives.Ints:in Java 8 you can do thisArrays.asList will not work as some of the other answers expect.This code will not create a list of 10 integers. It will print 1, not 10:This will create a list of integers:If you already have the array of ints, there is not quick way to convert, you\'re better off with the loop.On the other hand, if your array has Objects, not primitives in it, Arrays.asList will work:I\'ll add another answer with a different method; no loop but an anonymous class that will utilize the autoboxing features:The smallest piece of code would be:where ArrayUtils comes from commons-lang :)In Java 8 with stream:or with CollectorsIt\'s also worth checking out this bug report, which was closed with reason "Not a defect" and the following text:"Autoboxing of entire arrays is not specified behavior, for good reason.\nIt can be prohibitively expensive for large arrays."give a try to this class:testcase:The best shot:Examples:Here is a generic way to convert array to ArrayListUsageIf you\'re open to using a third party library, this will work in Eclipse Collections:Note: I am a committer for Eclipse Collections.
