I know that Ctrl + Shift + B launches a solution build, but I would like a shortcut that just builds the current project. Is a custom shortcut my only option?Edit: Looks like a custom shortcut is my only option as Shift + F6 does not work for me.Assigning the shortcut to "Build.BuildOnlyProject" command doesn\'t seem to work in VS2008. Assign the shortcut to "Build.BuildSelection".  If you have a solution with several projects and files open from the various projects, whatever file you are currently editing will define the project that will be built when you use the assigned shortcut for "Build.BuildSelection".You\'ll know the keyboard shortcut is working when you click the Build menu option and you see the keyboard shortcut on the menu itself.btw -  a restart/reboot is not required when assigning keyboard shortcuts.custom shortcut depending on what keybindings you are using.....if you look in your menu it will tell you if you have a keybinding.The other thing I have got used to, because I make use of ViEmu, is use the menu shortcuts. Which are actually quite quick to do, and are independent of bindings.  You can use the shortcuts already established in the main menu that are navigated with the Alt key:At least for VS2013:For some reason after installing Resharper I couldn\'t get a global shortcut to work (tried several times!!!), but as long as what you want to do is on the main menu, there is always an Alt + "Letter1", "Letter2" combination to trigger whatever action you\'d like :-)For C# development:F6 or Shift+Ctrl+B - Builds all the projects in the solution.Shift+F6 - Builds the selected project and its dependencies.for C# development. Tools -> Options. Select Keyboard, select additional keyboard mapping scheme to "Visual C# 2005". This mapping has F6 as standard shortcut.VS 2012 has Shift + F6 already mapped for this. I was surprised to learn this.Visual Studio 2015/17ALT + B + EALT + B = Open Build MenuE = Rebuild Current ProjectIn Visual Studio 2015, Alt + B, H will build your solution and publish it.press (Alt + B + J + B) these key combinations to build only current selected project of the solution (VS 2010).\nIt selects "Build" option from toolbar (Alt + B key ) , then goto "project only" (J key ) and then "Build Only XXX" project (B key). In the Visual Studio options window, under "Keyboard", look for the "Build.BuildOnlyProject" command and you can set whatever you want.
