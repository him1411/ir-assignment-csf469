I need to determine the current year in Java as an integer. I would like to be able to use this value as a counter that I can, for example, use to run from now until a specified year in the past (i.e. my value starts at 2008, and I have a "firstYearOfData" value that is set to 1994. I can now run my process from 2008 back to 1994). I could just use java.util.Date(), but it is deprecated.Not sure if this meets with the criteria of not setting up a new Calendar?  (Why the opposition to doing so?)Using Java 8\'s time API (assuming you are happy to get the year in your system\'s default time zone), you could use the Year::now method:This simplest (using Calendar, sorry) is:There is also the new Date and Time API JSR, as well as Joda TimeThe easiest way is to get the year from Calendar.If you want the year of any date object, I used the following method:If your application is making heavy use of Date and Calendar objects, you really should use Joda Time, because java.util.Date is mutable. java.util.Calendar has performance problems when its fields get updated, and is clunky for datetime arithmetic. As some people answered above:If you want to use the variable later, better use:If you need the year for just a condition you better use:For example using it in a do while that checks introduced year is not less than the current year-200 or more than the current year (Could be birth year):The answer by Raffi Khatchadourian wisely shows how to use the new java.time package in Java 8. But that answer fails to address the critical issue of time zone in determining a date.int year = LocalDate.now().getYear();That code depends on the JVM\'s current default time zone. The default zone is used in determining what today\xe2\x80\x99s date is. Remember, for example, that in the moment after midnight in Paris the date in Montr\xc3\xa9al is still \'yesterday\'. So your results may vary by what machine it runs on, a user/admin changing the host OS time zone, or any Java code at any moment changing the JVM\'s current default. Better to specify the time zone.By the way, always use proper time zone names. Never use the 3-4 letter codes that are neither standardized nor unique.Example in java.time of Java 8.Some idea as above, but using the Joda-Time 2.7 library.If your goal is to jump a year at a time, no need to extract the year number. Both Joda-Time and java.time have methods for adding/subtracting a year at a time. And those methods are smart, handling Daylight Saving Time and other anomalies.Example in Joda-Time 2.7.You can also use Java 8\'s LocalDate:You can also use 2 methods from java.time.YearMonth( Since Java 8 ):That\'s how I used, simple and easiest wayI use special functions in my library to work with days/month/year ints -You can do the whole thing using Integer math without needing to instantiate a calendar:May be off for an hour or two at new year but I don\'t get the impression that is an issue?
