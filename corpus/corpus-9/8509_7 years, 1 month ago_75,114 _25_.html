One use of the var keyword in C# is implicit type declaration. What is the java equivalent syntax for var?There is none. Alas, you have to type out the full type name.Edit 6 years after being posted, to collect some of the comments from below:The reason C# has the var keyword is because it\'s possible to have Types that have no name in .NET. Eg:In this case, it would be impossible to give a proper type to myData. 6 years ago, this was impossible in Java (all Types had names, even if they were extremely verbose and unweildy). I do not know if this has changed in the mean time.var is not the same as dynamic. variables are still 100% statically typed. This will not compile:var is also useful when the type is obvious from context. For example:I can say that in any code that I am responsible for, currentUser has a User or derived class in it. Obviously, if your implementation of User.GetCurrent return an int, then maybe this is a detriment to you.This has nothing to do with var, but if you have weird inheritance hierarchies where you shadow methods with other methods (eg new public void DoAThing()), don\'t forget that non-virtual methods are affected by the Type they are cast as.I can\'t imagine a real world scenario where this is indicative of good design, but this may not work as you expect:As indicated, virtual methods are not affected by this.No, there is no non-clumsy way to initialize a var without an actual variable.In this case, just do it the old fashioned way:If you add Lombok to your project you can its val keyword.http://projectlombok.org/features/val.htmlI have cooked up a plugin for IntelliJ that – in a way – gives you var in Java. It\'s a hack, so the usual disclaimers apply, but if you use IntelliJ for your Java development and want to try it out, it\'s at https://bitbucket.org/balpha/varsity.A simple solution (assuming you\'re using a decent ide).  Is to just type \'int\' everywhere and then get it to set the type for you.I actually just added a class called \'var\' so I don\'t have to type something different.The code is still too verbose but at least you dont have to type it!You can take a look to Kotlin by JetBrains, but it\'s val. not var.I know this is older but why not create a var class and create constructors with different types and depending on what constructors gets invoked you get var with different type. You could even build in methods to convert one type to another. JEP - JDK Enhancement-Proposalhttp://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286JEP 286: Local-Variable Type InferenceAuthor  Brian Goetz
