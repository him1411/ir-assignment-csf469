When I use Toast to display some popup text on the screen, it displays the text a little bit above the bottom of the screen, which is the default position.Now I want to display it in the middle of screen or somewhere according to my choice.Can anyone guide me how to achieve this?From the documentation,Positioning your ToastA standard toast notification appears near the bottom of the screen,\n  centered horizontally. You can change this position with the\n  setGravity(int, int, int) method. This accepts three parameters: a\n  Gravity constant, an x-position offset, and a y-position offset.For example, if you decide that the toast should appear in the\n  top-left corner, you can set the gravity like this:If you want to nudge the position to the right, increase the value of\n  the second parameter. To nudge it down, increase the value of the last\n  parameter.As an aside if you get the error indicating that you must call makeText, the following code makes it work:You can customize the location of your Toast by using:setGravity(int gravity, int xOffset, int yOffset) docsThis allows you to be very specific about where you want the location of your Toast to be.One of the most useful things about the xOffset and yOffset parameters is that you can use them to place the Toast relative to a certain View.For example, if you want to make a custom Toast that appears on top of a Button, you could create a function like this:The above code is will help u to display toast in the middle of screen or according to ur choice for that just set the toast gravity according to ur need Note: For this process u have to use object of Toastsetting toast at topin screennow at bottomthe same way we can set toast in left, right and also centerClick hereThe method to change the color, position and background color of toast is:For line by line explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bzhGd1HZOc
