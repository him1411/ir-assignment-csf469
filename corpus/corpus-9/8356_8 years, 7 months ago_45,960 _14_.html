I know the regex for doing a global replace,How do you go about doing an interactive search-replace in Vim?Add the flag c (in the vim command prompt):will give you a yes/no prompt at each occurrence of \'old\'.Mark Biek pointed out using:for a global search replace with confirmation for each substitution. But, I also enjoy interactively verifying that the old text will match correctly. I first do a search with a regex, then I reuse that pattern:The s// will use the last search pattern.I think you\'re looking for c, eg s/abc/123/gc, this will cause VIM to confirm the replacements. See :help :substitute for more information.If you just want to count the number of occurrences of \'abc\' then you can do %s/abc//gn. This doesn\'t replace anything but just reports the number of occurrences of \'abc\'.I usually use the find/substitute/next/repeat command :-)That\'s find "old", substitute 3 characters for "new", find next, repeat substitute, and so on.It\'s a pain for massive substitutions but it lets you selectively ignore some occurrences of old (by just pressing n again to find the next one instead of . to repeat a substitution).If your replacement text needs to change for each matched occurrence (i.e. not simply choosing Yes/No to apply a singular replacement) you can use a Vim plugin I made called interactive-replace.
