Our client had given me a REST API to which I need to make a PHP call to. But as a matter of fact the documentation given with the API is very limited, so I don\'t really know how to call the service.I\'ve tried to Google it, but the only thing that came up was an already expired Yahoo! tutorial on how to call the service. Not mentioning the headers or anything in depth information. Is there any decent information around how to call a REST API, or some documentation about it? Because even on W3schools, they only describes the SOAP method. What are different options for making rest API in PHP?You can access any REST API with PHPs cURL Extension. However, the API Documentation (Methods, Parameters etc.) must be provided by your Client!Example:If you have a url and your php supports it, you could just call file_get_contents:if $response is JSON, use json_decode to turn it into php array:if $response is XML, use simple_xml class:http://sg2.php.net/manual/en/simplexml.examples-basic.phpUse Guzzle.  It\'s a "PHP HTTP client that makes it easy to work with HTTP/1.1 and takes the pain out of consuming web services".  Working with Guzzle is much easier than working with cURL.Here\'s an example from the Web site:CURL is the simplest way to go. Here is a simple callUse HTTPFULHttpful is a simple, chainable, readable PHP library intended to make speaking HTTP sane. It lets the developer focus on interacting with APIs instead of sifting through curl set_opt pages and is an ideal PHP REST client. Httpful includes...Ex.Send off a GET request. Get automatically parsed JSON response.The library notices the JSON Content-Type in the response and automatically parses the response into a native PHP object.You will need to know if the REST API you are calling supports GET or POST, or both methods.  The code below is something that works for me, I\'m calling my own web service API, so I already know what the API takes and what it will return. It supports both GET and POST methods, so the less sensitive info goes into the URL (GET), and the info like username and password is submitted as POST variables. Also, everything goes over the HTTPS connection.Inside the API code, I encode an array I want to return into json format, then simply use PHP command echo $my_json_variable to make that json string availabe to the client.So as you can see, my API returns json data, but you need to know (or look at the returned data to find out) what format the response from the API is in.This is how I connect to the API from the client side:BTW, I also tried to use file_get_contents() method as some of the users here suggested, but that din\'t work well for me.  I found out the curl method to be faster and more reliable.There are plenty of clients actually. One of them is Pest - check this out. And keep in mind that these REST calls are simple http request with various methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.If you are using Symfony there\'s a great rest client bundle that even includes all of the ~100 exceptions and throws them instead of returning some meaningless error code + message.You should really check it:\nhttps://github.com/CircleOfNice/CiRestClientBundleI love the interface:Works for all http methods.You can use file_get_contents to issue any http POST/PUT/DELETE/OPTIONS/HEAD methods, in addition to the GET method as the function name suggests.How to post data in PHP using file_get_contents?If you are open to use third party tools you\'d have a look at this one:\nhttps://github.com/CircleOfNice/DoctrineRestDriverThis is a completely new way to work with APIs.First of all you define an entity which is defining the structure of incoming and outcoming data and annotate it with datasources:Now it\'s pretty easy to communicate with the REST API:
