I\'m not sure if this is Flask specific, but when I run an app in dev mode (http://localhost:5000), I cannot access it from other machines on the network (with http://[dev-host-ip]:5000). With Rails in dev mode, for example, it works fine. I couldn\'t find any docs regarding the Flask dev server configuration. Any idea what should be configured to enable this?Add a parameter to your app.run().  By default it runs on localhost, change it to app.run(host= \'0.0.0.0\') to run on your machines IP address.Documented on the Flask site under "Externally Visible Server" on the Quickstart page:Externally Visible ServerIf you run the server you will notice that the server is only\n  available from your own computer, not from any other in the network.\n  This is the default because in debugging mode a user of the\n  application can execute arbitrary Python code on your computer. If you\n  have debug disabled or trust the users on your network, you can make\n  the server publicly available.Just change the call of the run() method to look like this:app.run(host=\'0.0.0.0\')This tells your operating system to listen on a public IP.If you use the flask executable to start your server, you can use flask run --host=0.0.0.0 to change the default from 127.0.0.1 and open it up to non local connections. The config and app.run methods that the other answers describe are probably better practice but this can be handy as well.Externally Visible Server If you run the server you will notice that\n  the server is only accessible from your own computer, not from any\n  other in the network. This is the default because in debugging mode a\n  user of the application can execute arbitrary Python code on your\n  computer.If you have the debugger disabled or trust the users on your network,\n  you can make the server publicly available simply by adding\n  --host=0.0.0.0 to the command line:flask run --host=0.0.0.0 This tells your operating system to listen on\n  all public IPs.Reference: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/quickstart/If your cool app has it\'s configuration loaded from an external file, like in the following example, then don\'t forget to update the corresponding config file with HOST="0.0.0.0"If @Shawn Swaner\'s solutions doesn\'t work, you may check your iptables. Refer How to allow remote connections to Flask?.Adding to @Shawn\'s answer, there is also a builtin configuration variable SERVER_NAME. we can set that to 0.0.0.0 in the config file which you specify in app.config.from_pyfile("config.py"). Also note that, this will override app.run host name.\n Reference: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/config/
