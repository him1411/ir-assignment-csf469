Here in stackoverflow, if you started to make changes then you attempt to navigate away from the page, a javascript confirm button shows up and asks: "Are you sure you want to navigate away from this page?" blee blah bloo...Has anyone implemented this before, how do I track that changes were committed?\nI believe I could do this myself, I am trying to learn the good practices from you the experts.I tried the following but still doesn\'t work:Can anyone post an example?Modern browsers now consider displaying a custom message to be a security hazard and it has therefore been removed from all of them. Browsers now only display generic messages. Since we no longer have to worry about setting the message, it is as simple as:Read below for legacy browser support.The orginal answer is suitable for IE6-8 and FX1-3.5 (which is what we were targeting back in 2009 when it was written), but is rather out of date now and won\'t work in most current browsers - I\'ve left it below for reference.The window.onbeforeunload is not treated consistently by all browsers. It should be a function reference and not a string (as the original answer stated) but that will work in older browsers because the check for most of them appears to be whether anything is assigned to onbeforeunload (including a function that returns null).You set window.onbeforeunload to a function reference, but in older browsers you have to set the returnValue of the event instead of just returning a string:You can\'t have that confirmOnPageExit do the check and return null if you want the user to continue without the message. You still need to remove the event to reliably turn it on and off:To turn it on:To turn it off:Bear in mind that this isn\'t a normal event - you can\'t bind to it in the standard way.To check for values? That depends on your validation framework.In jQuery this could be something like (very basic example):The onbeforeunload Microsoft-ism is the closest thing we have to a standard solution, but be aware that browser support is uneven; e.g. for Opera it only works in version 12 and later (still in beta as of this writing).Also, for maximum compatibility, you need to do more than simply return a string, as explained on the Mozilla Developer Network.Example: Define the following two functions for enabling/disabling the navigation prompt (cf. the MDN example):Then define a form like this:This way, the user will only be warned about navigating away if he has changed the text area, and will not be prompted when he\'s actually submitting the form.To make this work in Chrome and Safari, you would have to do it like thisReference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onbeforeunloadWith JQuery this stuff is pretty easy to do. Since you can bind to sets. Its NOT enough to do the onbeforeunload, you want to only trigger the navigate away if someone started editing stuff.jquerys \'beforeunload\' worked great for meThis is an easy way to present the message if any data is input into the form, and not to show the message if the form is submitted:for new people who is looking for a simple solution, just try Areyousure.jsTo expand on Keith\'s already amazing answer:To allow custom warning messages, you can wrap it in a function like this:Then just call that function with your custom message:To re-enable navigation, all you need to do is set window.onbeforeunload to null. Here it is, wrapped in a neat little function that can be called anywhere:If using jQuery, this can easily be bound to all of the elements of a form like this:Then to allow the form to be submitted:preventNavigation() and enableNavigation() can be bound to any other functions as needed, such as dynamically modifying a form, or clicking on a button that sends an AJAX request. I did this by adding a hidden input element to the form:Then any time I want to prevent the user from navigating away, I trigger the change on that input to make sure that preventNavigation() gets executed:Here try this it works 100%  When the user starts making changes to the form, a boolean flag will be set. If the user then tries to navigate away from the page, you check that flag in the window.onunload event. If the flag is set, you show the message by returning it as a string. Returning the message as a string will popup a confirmation dialog containing your message.If you are using ajax to commit the changes, you can set the flag to false after the changes have been committed (i.e. in the ajax success event).You can add an onchange event on the textarea (or any other fields) that set a variable in JS. When the user attempts to close the page (window.onunload) you check the value of that variable and show the alert accordingly. Based on all the answers on this thread, I wrote the following code and it worked for me.  If you have only some input/textarea tags which requires an onunload event to be checked, you can assign HTML5 data-attributes as data-onunload="true"for eg.and the Javascript (jQuery) can look like this :here is my html  And so this is how I did something similar in javaScriptIt can be easily done by setting a ChangeFlag to true, on onChange event of TextArea. Use javascript to show confirm dialog box based on the ChangeFlag value. Discard the form and navigate to requested page if confirm returns true, else do-nothing.There is an "onunload" parameter for the body tag you can call javascript functions from there. If it returns false it prevents navigating away.What you want to use is the onunload event in JavaScript.Here is an example: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onunload.asp
