I want to replace the contents within a html element so I\'m using the following function for that:The above works great but the problem is I have more than one html element on a page that I want to replace the contents of. So I can\'t use ids but classes instead. I have been told that javascript does not support any type of inbuilt get element by class function. So how can the above code be revised to make it work with classes instead of ids? P.S. I don\'t want to use jQuery for this.This code should work in all browsers.The way it works is by looping through all of the elements in the document, and searching their class list for matchClass. If a match is found, the contents is replaced.jsFiddle Example, using Vanilla JS (i.e. no framework)Of course, all modern browsers now support the following simpler way:but be warned it doesn\'t work with IE8 or before. See http://caniuse.com/getelementsbyclassnameAlso, not all browsers will return a pure NodeList like they\'re supposed to.You\'re probably still better off using your favorite cross-browser library.That will work in "modern" browsers that implement that method.If you want to provide support for older browsers, you could load a stand-alone selector engine like Sizzle (4KB mini+gzip) or Peppy (10K mini) and fall back to it if the native querySelector method is not found. Is it overkill to load a selector engine just so you can get elements with a certain class? Probably. However, the scripts aren\'t all that big and you will may find the selector engine useful in many other places in your script.A Simple and an easy way      I\'m surprised there are no answers using Regular Expressions. This is pretty much Andrew\'s answer, using RegExp.test instead of String.indexOf, since it seems to perform better for multiple operations, according to jsPerf tests.\nIt also seems to be supported on IE6.If you look for the same class(es) frequently, you can further improve it by storing the (precompiled) regular expressions elsewhere, and passing them directly to the function, instead of a string.This should work in pretty much any browser...You should be able to use it like this:I think something like:would work To elaborate on ColcCold\'s answer above, this is the code itself:You can take a look at this popular review:\nhttp://blog.blackbam.at/2011/07/01/my-todays-top-10-most-useful-javascript-functions/I assume this was not a valid option when this was originally asked, but you can now use document.getElementsByClassName(\'\');. For example:See the MDN documentation for more.When some elements lack ID, I use jQuery like this:This might be a strange solution, but maybe someone find it useful.
