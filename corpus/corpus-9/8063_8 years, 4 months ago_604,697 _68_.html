I\'m just beginning to write programs in Java. What does the following Java code mean?What is String[] args? When would you use these args?Source code and/or examples are preferred over abstract explanationsIn Java args contains the supplied command-line arguments as an array of String objects.In other words, if you run your program as java MyProgram one two then args will contain ["one", "two"].If you wanted to output the contents of args, you can just loop through them like this...Those are for command-line arguments in Java.In other words, if you runjava MyProgram one twoThen args contains:[ "one", "two" ]The reason for this is to configure your application to run a particular way or provide it with some piece of information it needs.If you are new to Java, I highly recommend reading through the official Oracle\'s JavaTM Tutorials.args contains the command-line arguments passed to the Java program upon invocation. For example, if I invoke the program like so:Then args will be an array containing the strings "-f" and "file.txt".String [] args is also how you declare an array of Strings in Java.  In this method signature, the array args will be filled with values when the method is called (as the other examples here show).  Since you\'re learning though, it\'s worth understanding that this args array is just like if you created one yourself in a method, as in this:The following answer is based my understanding & some test.What is String[] args?Ans- >String[]  ->  As We know this is a simple String array.args  ->  is the name of an array it can be anything (e.g. a, ar, argument, param, parameter) no issues with compiler & executed & I tested as well.E.g.\n1)public static void main(String[] argument)2)public static void main(String[] parameter)When would you use these args?Ans->The main function is designed very intelligently by developers. Actual thinking is very deep.\n    Which is basically developed under consideration of C & C++ based on Command line argument but nowadays nobody uses it more. Thing 1- User can enter any type of data from the command line can be Number or String & necessary to accept it by the compiler which datatype we should have to use? see the thing 2Thing 2- String is the datatype which supports all of the primitive datatypes like int, long, float, double, byte, shot, char in Java. You can easily parse it in any primitive datatype.E.g The following program is compiled & executed & I tested as well.If input is ->  1  1 When a java class is executed from the console, the main method is what is called.  In order for this to happen, the definition of this main method must beThe fact that this string array is called args is a standard convention, but not strictly required.  You would populate this array at the command line whne you invoke your programThese are commonly used to define options of your program, for example files to write to or read from.When you finish your code, you will turn it into a file with the extension .java, which can be run by double clicking it, but  also throughout a console (terminal on a mac, cmd.exe on windows) which lets the user do many things. One thing is they can see console messages (System.out.print or System.out.println) which they can\'t see if they double click. Another thing they can do is specify parameters, so normally you would use the line after navigating to the folder of the program with on windows oron Mac (notice that mac is less clunky) to run code, but to specify parameters you would useThese parameters stored in the args array, which you can use in your program is you want to allow the user to control special parameters such as what file to use or how much memory the program can have. If you want to know how to use an array, you could probably find a topic on this site or just google it. Note that any number of parameters can be used.I think it\'s pretty well covered by the answers above that String args[] is simply an array of string arguments you can pass to your application when you run it. For completion, I might add that it\'s also valid to define the method parameter passed to the main method as a variable argument (varargs) of type String:public static void main (String... args)In other words, the main method must accept either a String array (String args[]) or varargs (String... args) as a method argument. And there is no magic with the name args either. You might as well write arguments or even freddiefujiwara as shown in below e.gs.:public static void main (String[] arguments)public static void main (String[] freddiefujiwara)in \npublic static void main(String args[])\nargs is an array of console line argument whose data type is String.\nin this array, you can store various string arguments by invoking them at the command line as shown below:\njava myProgram Shaan Royal\nthen Shaan and Royal will be stored in the array as\narg[0]="Shaan";\narg[1]="Royal";\nyou can do this manually also inside the program, when you don\'t call them at the command line. Explanation in simple layman\'s language.The main method expects us to provide some arguments when we direct our JVM to the class name. That means, suppose your file name is Try.java, now to execute this in command prompt you write "javac Try.java" to compile followed by "java Try" to execute. Now suppose instead of writing simply "java Try" you write "java Try 1". Here you have passed an argument "1". This will be taken by your main method even if you don\'t use it in your code.If you want to check whether your main method has actually taken the argument "1" or not. Simply, inside your main method type the following:I would break upin parts."public" means that main() can be called from anywhere."static" means that main() doesn\'t belong to a specific object"void" means that main() returns no value"main" is the name of a function. main() is special because it is the start of the program."String[]" means an array of String."args" is the name of the String[] (within the body of main()). "args" is not special; you could name it anything else and the program would work the same.The style dataType[] arrayRefVar is preferred. The style dataType arrayRefVar[] comes from the C/C++ language and was adopted in Java to accommodate C/C++ programmers.Even tho OP is only talking about the String[] args, i want to give a complete example of the public static void main(String[] args). Public : is an Access Modifier, which defines who can access this Method. Public means that this Method will be accessible by any Class(If other Classes are able to access this Class.).Static : is a keyword which identifies the class related thing. This means the given Method or variable is not instance related but Class related. It can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class.Void : is used to define the Return Type of the Method. It defines what the method can return. Void means the Method will not return any value.main: is the name of the Method. This Method name is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application with a particular signature only.String[] args : is the parameter to the main Method.If you look into JDK source code (jdk-src\\j2se\\src\\share\\bin\\java.c):You can see that the starting method in java must be named main and must have the specific signature public static void main(String[] args)The code also tells us that the public static void main(String[] args) is not fixed, if you change the code in (jdk-src\\j2se\\src\\share\\bin\\java.c) to another signature, it will work but changing this will give you other possible problems because of the java specsOfftopic: It\'s been 7 years since OP asked this question, my guess is that OP can answer his own question by now.
