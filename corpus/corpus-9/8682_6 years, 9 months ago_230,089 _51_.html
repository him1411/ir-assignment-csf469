When I try to use git command on my regular windows cmd or cmd with ruby, I get the following error.\'git\' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\n  operable program or batch file. How do I fix this problem?Have you correctly set your PATH to point at your git installation?This is how you can do it:Did you open the cmd prompt before installation of git? If so, close and reopen it.if you have installed git for window (http://windows.github.com/) , then find git.exe in "C" drive.\nit will be something like C:\\Users\\dell\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_8810fd5c2c79c73adcc73fd0825f3b32fdb816e7\\libexec\\git-coreadd this to window Environment Variables  as said aboveEasy route to avoid messing with PATH variables: re-install git and select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt". It\'ll take of the PATH variables for you as mentioned. see screenshotIf you want to setup for temporary purpose, just execute below command.This is valid for current window/cell only, if you will close command prompt, everything will get vanish.\nFor permanently setting, set GIT in environment variable.a. press Window+Pause \nb. click on Advance system setting.c. Click on Environment variable under Advance Tab.d. Edit Path Variable.e. Add below line in end of statement.\n;c:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin; f. Press OK!! \ng. Open new command prompt . \nh. Type git and press EnterThanksGit should be configured in your path variables.(on Windows 7)\nOpen the start button and type in environment. Click on Edit the system environment variables. Click Environment Variables. Scroll down to the Path variable in the bottom box\n named system variables. Click edit. In the bottom box named variable value add the path to your git bin folder. (for me this is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin but it can be different for you.) If there is no semicolon (;) between your path and the previous one, add one there. Make sure you don\'t delete the other path variables, only add the git bin folder to the end.This worked for me. Git is now available through the command line.\nOpen the command line and type git to verify if it worked for you.Start->All Programs->Git->Git BashTakes you directly to the Git Shell.Windows 8Add C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\cmdIt worked for meYo! I had lots of problems with this. It seems that Github brings its own console which you need to look for in your drive. I managed to finally run it by doing the following:*This shall open *Where username is your PC\'s usernameThis will open a PowerShell command prompt. Then you can run your git commands normally on it. that\'s because at the time of installation you have selected the default radio button to use "git" with the "git bash" only. If you would have chosen "git and command line tool" than this would not be an issue. Cheers ;)On Windows use msysgit to get a bash prompt with a git command.I installed Git and tried using Command prompt under actions in Team explorer/Changes.add above path in environment variables note: path may differ but you should add both bin and cmdAfter installation, open the GitHub app and on the top right corner you\'d notice a setting icon. Select Options from the dropdown and choose "Default Shell" as Cmd.Now try typing \'git shell\' in the search (windows key and type) and choose Git Shell. It should open up in CMD and git should now be recognized.Just wanted to add to Abizern answer.\nIf anyone is using a non-administrator account, you can create a "local" variable instead of a "system" variable which allows access to standard/limited accounts. \n\nWhen on the "Environmental Variables" window:\n\n1) Select "New..." button within the "User variables for ..." section.\n\n2) Set the "Variable name:" as "path" and "Variable value:" as "[your-git-path]" (usually found at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin).\n\n3) Then click OK.Windows 7 32 - bitI am using git for my Ruby on Rails application. First time so...I created a .bat file for loading my RoR applications with the paths manually typed using this tutorial at "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eFwV8lRu1w" If you are new to Ruby on Rails you might want to check it out as I followed all steps and it works flawlessly after a few trials and errors.(The .bat file is editable using notepad++ hence no need for the long process whenever you need to edit a path, you can follow these simple process after creating a .bat file following the tutorials on the link above "file is called row.bat".)insert path below the last path you inputted.)\nDuring the tutorials I don\'t remember anything said in regards to using the git command so when starting a new project I had this same problem after installing git. The main issue I had was locating the folder with the bin/git.exe (git.exe did not show up in search using start menu\'s "search programs and files" ) NOTE I now understood that the location might vary drastically --- see below. To locate the bin/git.exe i followed this steps1 left click start menu and locate ->> all programs ->> GitHub inc.\n2 right click git shell and select open file location\n3 click through folders in the file location for the folder "bin" (I had 4 folders named\n1.

Problem solved!
