Now that it\'s clear what a metaclass is, there is an associated concept that I use all the time without knowing what it really means. I suppose everybody made once a mistake with parenthesis, resulting  in an "object is not callable" exception. What\'s more, using __init__ and __new__ lead to wonder what this bloody __call__ can be used for.Could you give me some explanations, including examples with the magic method ?A callable is anything that can be called. The built-in callable (PyCallable_Check in objects.c) checks if the argument is either:The method named __call__ is (according to the documentation)Called when the instance is \'\'called\'\' as a functionFrom Python\'s sources object.c:It says:Desciption of tp_call field:ternaryfunc tp_call An optional\n  pointer to a function that implements\n  calling the object. This should be\n  NULL if the object is not callable.\n  The signature is the same as for\n  PyObject_Call(). This field is\n  inherited by subtypes.You can always use built-in callable function to determine whether given object is callable or not; or better yet just call it and catch TypeError later. callable is removed in Python 3.0 and 3.1, use callable = lambda o: hasattr(o, \'__call__\') or isinstance(o, collections.Callable).Example, a simplistic cache implementation:Usage:Example from standard library, file site.py, definition of built-in exit() and quit() functions:A callable is an object allows you to use round parenthesis ( ) and eventually pass some parameters, just like functions.Every time you define a function python creates a callable object. \nIn example, you could define the function func in these ways (it\'s the same):You could use this method instead of methods like doit or run, I think it\'s just more clear to see obj() than obj.doit()Let me explain backwards:Consider this...... as syntactic sugar for:Where foo can be any object that responds to __call__. When I say any object, I mean it: built-in types, your own classes and their instances.In the case of built-in types, when you write:You\'re essentially doing:That\'s also why you don\'t have foo = new int in Python: you just make the class object return an instance of it on __call__. The way Python solves this is very elegant in my opinion.A Callable is an object that has the __call__ method.  This means you can fake callable functions or do neat things like Partial Function Application where you take a function and add something that enhances it or fills in some of the parameters, returning something that can be called in turn (known as Currying in functional programming circles).Certain typographic errors will have the interpreter attempting to call something you did not intend, such as (for example) a string.  This can produce errors where the interpreter attempts to execute a non-callable application.  You can see this happening in a python interpreter by doing something like the transcript below.Quite simply, a "callable" is something that can be called like a method.  The built in function "callable()" will tell you whether something appears to be callable, as will checking for a call property.  Functions are callable as are classes, class instances can be callable.  See more about this here and here.__call__ makes any object be callable as a function.This example will output 8:In Python a callable is an object which type has a __call__ method:As simple as that :)This of course can be overloaded:To check function or method of class is callable or not that means we can call that function.It\'s something you can put "(args)" after and expect it to work.  A callable is usually a method or a class.  Methods get called, classes get instantiated.Good examples here.callables implement the __call__ special method so any object with such a method is callable.Callable is a type or class of "Build-in function or Method" with a method\ncallExample:\nprint is a callable object. With a build-in function __call__ \nWhen you invoke the print function, Python creates an object of type print and invokes its method __call__ passing the parameters if any.Thank you.\nRegards,\nMaristo find out an object is callable or not try thisthere will be no output here.
