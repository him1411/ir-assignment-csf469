I am using SQL Server 2008 Enterprise. I want to see any active SQL Server connections, and the related information of all the connections, like from which IP address, connect to which DB or something.Any existing tools to solve this issue?You can use sp_who stored procedure. Provides information about current users, sessions, and processes in an instance of the Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine. The information can be filtered to return only those processes that are not idle, that belong to a specific user, or that belong to a specific session.A part from sp_who, you can also use the "undocumented" sp_who2 system stored procedure which gives you more detailed information. See http://www.sqlteam.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=100099click "activity monitor" icon in toolbar..From Thorsten Comments:\nIn SQL Server Management Studio, right click on Server, choose "Activity Monitor" from context menu -or- use keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+AI threw this together so that you could do some querying on the resultsor using this tool: sqldog.combelow is my script to find all the sessions connected to a database and you can check if those sessions are doing any I/O and there is an option to kill them.the script shows also the status of each session\nhave a look below
