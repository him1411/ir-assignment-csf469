I\'d like to know the difference between the following in JavaWhen do I have to use the above code appropriately?The parameter of exit should qualify if the execution of the program went good or bad. It\'s a sort of heredity from older programming languages where it\'s useful to know if something went wrong and what went wrong.Exit code isIf I\'m correct exit codes used to be just positive numbers (I mean in UNIX) and according to range:But I don\'t think you should care while coding on Java, it\'s just a bit of information. It\'s useful if you plan to make your programs interact with standard tools.Zero => Everything OkayPositive => Something I expected could potentially go wrong went wrong (bad command-line, can\'t find file, could not connect to server)Negative => Something I didn\'t expect at all went wrong (system error - unanticipated exception - externally forced termination e.g. kill -9)(values greater than 128 are actually negative, if you regard them as 8-bit signed binary, or twos complement)There\'s a load of good standard exit-codes hereSystem.exit(system call) terminates the currently running Java virtual machine by initiating its shutdown sequence. The argument serves as a status code.  By convention, a nonzero status code indicates abnormal termination.Read More at JavaOn Unix and Linux systems, 0 for successful executions and 1 or higher for failed executions.A non-zero exit status code, usually indicates abnormal termination. if n != 0, its up to the programmer to apply a meaning to the various n\'s. From https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html.Here is the answer. As others answer 0 meaning success, otherwise.  If you using bat file (window) System.exit(x) will effect.Code java (myapp):}bat file:A good gotcha is any error code > 255 will be converted to error code % 256.\nOne should be specifically careful about this if they are using a custom error code > 255 and expecting the exact error code in the application logic.\nhttp://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.htmlSystem.exit(0)\nby convention, a nonzero status code indicates abnormal termination.System.exit(1)\n-It means termination unsuccessful due to some error }In the above code when its System.exit(0); and when i press case 5 it exits properly but when i use System.exit(1); and press case 5 it exits with error and again when i try with case 15 it exits properly by this i got to know that, when ever we put any int inside argument it specifies that, it take the character from that position i.e if i put (4) that it means take 5th character from that string if its (3) then it means take 4th character from that inputed string
