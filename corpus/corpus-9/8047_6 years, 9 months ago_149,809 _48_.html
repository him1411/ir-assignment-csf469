I have a few files in the assets folder. I need to copy all of them to a folder say /sdcard/folder. I want to do this from within a thread. How do I do it? If anyone else is having the same problem, this is how I did itReference : Move file using JavaBased on your solution, I did something of my own to allow subfolders. Someone might find this helpful:......The solution above did not work due to some errors:Here is the code (I left the Log statements but you can drop them now):EDIT: Corrected a misplaced ";" that was throwing a systematic "could not create dir" error.I know this has been answered but I have a slightly more elegant way to copy from asset directory to a file on the sdcard.  It requires no "for" loop but instead uses File Streams and Channels to do the work.  (Note) If using any type of compressed file, APK, PDF, ... you may want to rename the file extension before inserting into asset and then rename once you copy it to SDcard)A way to copy a file without having to loop through it.Good example. Answered my question of how to access files in the assets folder.Only change I would suggest is in the for loop. The following format would work too and is preferred:try out this it is much simpler ,this will help u:Here is a cleaned up version for current Android devices, functional method design so that you can copy it to an AssetsHelper class e.g ;) Copy all files and directories from assets to your folder!for copying better use apache commons io//THIS IS MAIN METHOD FOR COPY//THIS FROM commons IOModified this SO answer by @DannyAPreparationsin src/main/assets\nadd folder with name foldUsageIn to the external directory find all files and directories that are within the fold assetsBased on Yoram Cohen answer, here is a version that supports non static target directory.Invoque with copyFileOrDir(getDataDir(), "") to write to internal app storage folder /data/data/pkg_name/Avoids copying "images" etc fake asset folders like Use AssetManager, it allows to read the files in the assets. Then use regular Java IO to write the files to sdcard.Google is your friend, search for an example.change parts of code like these:the before example is for Pdfs, in case of to example .txtHi Guys I Did Something like this. \nFor N-th Depth Copy Folder and Files to copy.\nWhich Allows you to copy all the directory structure to copy from Android AssetManager :)In the end Create a Asynctask:call it From your activity:Slight modification of above answer to copy a folder recursively and to accommodate custom destination.There are essentially two ways to do this.First, you can use AssetManager.open and, as described by Rohith Nandakumar and iterate over the inputstream.Second, you can use AssetManager.openFd, which allows you to use a FileChannel  (which has the [transferTo](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#transferTo(long, long, java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel)) and [transferFrom](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#transferFrom(java.nio.channels.ReadableByteChannel, long, long)) methods), so you don\'t have to loop over the input stream yourself.I will describe the openFd method here.First you need to ensure that the file is stored uncompressed. The packaging system may choose to compress any file with an extension that is not marked as noCompress, and compressed files cannot be memory mapped, so you will have to rely on AssetManager.open in that case.You can add a \'.mp3\' extension to your file to stop it from being compressed, but the proper solution is to modify your app/build.gradle file and add the following lines (to disable compression of PDF files)Note that the packager can still pack multiple files into one, so you can\'t just read the whole file the AssetManager gives you. You need to to ask the AssetFileDescriptor which parts you need.Once you\'ve ensured your file is stored uncompressed, you can use the AssetManager.openFd method to obtain an AssetFileDescriptor, which can be used to obtain a FileInputStream (unlike AssetManager.open, which returns an InputStream) that contains a FileChannel. It also contains the starting offset (getStartOffset) and size (getLength), which you need to obtain the correct part of the file.An example implementation is given below:This answer is based on JPM\'s answer.Using some of the concepts in the answers to this question, I wrote up a class called AssetCopier to make copying /assets/ simple. It\'s available on github and can be accessed with jitpack.io:See https://github.com/flipagram/android-assetcopier for more details.
