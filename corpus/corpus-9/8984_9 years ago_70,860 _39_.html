1) MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehaviorSource: Naming standards for Unit Tests2) Separating Each Word By UnderscoreI am pretty much with you on this one man. The naming conventions you have used are:What more do you need from a test name?Contrary to Ray\'s answer I don\'t think the Test prefix is necessary. It\'s test code, we know that. If you need to do this to identify the code, then you have bigger problems, your test code should not be mixed up with your production code.As for length and use of underscore, its test code, who the hell cares? Only you and your team will see it, so long as it is readable, and clear about what the test is doing, carry on! :)That said, I am still quite new to testing and blogging my adventures with it :)This is also worth a read: Structuring Unit TestsThe structure has a test class per class being tested. That\xe2\x80\x99s not so unusual. But what was unusual to me was that he had a nested class for each method being tested.e.g.And here is why:Well for one thing, it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice way to keep tests organized. All the\n  tests (or facts) for a method are grouped together. For example, if\n  you use the CTRL+M, CTRL+O shortcut to collapse method bodies, you can\n  easily scan your tests and read them like a spec for your code.I also like this approach:MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehaviorSo perhaps adjust to:StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior Because each test will already be in a nested classI tend to use the convention of MethodName_DoesWhat_WhenTheseConditions so for example:However, what I do see a lot is to make the test name follow the unit testing structure ofWhich also follows the BDD / Gherkin syntax of:which would be to name the test in the manner of: UnderTheseTestConditions_WhenIDoThis_ThenIGetThisso to your example:However I do much prefer putting the method name being tested first, because then the tests can be arranged alphabetically, or appear alphabetically sorted in the member dropdown box in VisStudio, and all the tests for 1 method are grouped together.In any case, I like separating the major sections of the test name with underscores, as opposed to every word, because I think it makes it easier to read and get the point of the test across.In other words, I like: Sum_ThrowsException_WhenNegativeNumberAs1stParam better than Sum_Throws_Exception_When_Negative_Number_As_1st_Param.I do name my test methods like other methods using "PascalCasing" without any underscores or separators. I leave the postfix Test for the method out, cause it adds no value. That the method is a test method is indicated by the attribute TestMethod.Due to the fact that each Test class should only test one other class i leave the name of the class out of the method name. The name of the class that contains the test methods is named like the class under test with the postfix "Tests".For methods that test for exceptions or actions that are not possible, i prefix the test method with the word Cannot.My naming convension are base on the article "TDD Tips: Test Naming Conventions & Guidelines" of Bryan Cook. I found this article very helpful.The first set of names is more readable to me, since the CamelCasing separates words and the underbars separate parts of the naming scheme.I also tend to include "Test" somewhere, either in the function name or the enclosing namespace or class.As long as you follow a single practice, it doesn\'t really matter. Generally, I write a single unit test for a method that covers all the variations for a method (I have simple methods;) and then write more complex sets of tests for methods that require it. My naming structure is thus usually test (a holdover from JUnit 3).I use a \'T\' prefix for test namespaces, classes and methods.I try to be neat and create folders that replicate the namespaces, then create a tests folder or separate project for the tests and replicate the production structure for the basic tests:I can easily see that something is a test, I know exactly what original code it pertains to, (if you can\'t work that out, then the test is too convoluted anyway).It looks just like the interfaces naming convention, (I mean, you don\'t get confused with things starting with \'I\', nor will you with \'T\').It\'s easy to just compile with or without the tests.It\'s good in theory anyway, and works pretty well for small projects.
