How can I select all tr elements except for the first tr in a table with CSS?I tried using this method but found that it did not work:http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/08/22/how-to-select-even-or-odd-rows-in-a-table-using-css-3/By adding a class to either the first tr or the subsequent trs. There is no crossbrowser way of selecting the rows you want with CSS alone.However, if you don\'t care about Internet Explorer 6, 7 or 8:I\'m surprised nobody mentioned the use of sibling combinators, which are supported by IE7 and later:They both function in exactly the same way (in the context of HTML tables anyway) as:ideal solution but not supported in IEsecond solution would be to style all tr\'s and then override with css for first-child:sounds like the \'first line\' you\'re talking of is your table-header - so you realy should think of using thead and tbody in your markup (click here) which would result in \'better\' markup (semantically correct, useful for things like screenreaders) and easier, cross-browser-friendly possibilitys for css-selection (table thead ... { ... })Though the question has a decent answer already, I just want to stress that the :first-child tag goes on the item type that represents the children.For example, in the code:If you want to affect only the second two elements with a margin, but not the first, you would do:that is, since the inputs are the children, you would place first-child on the input portion of the selector.Sorry I know this is old but why not style all tr elements the way you want all except the first and the use the psuedo class :first-child where you revoke what you specified for all tr elements.Better descriped by this example:http://jsfiddle.net/DWTr7/1//PatrikSince tr:not(:first-child) is not supported by IE 6, 7, 8. You can use the help of jQuery.\nYou may find it hereAnother option:You could also use a pseudo class selector in your CSS like this:That will not apply the class to the first element with the class .desc.Here\'s a JSFiddle with an example: http://jsfiddle.net/YYTFT/, and this is a good source to explain pseudo class selectors: http://css-tricks.com/pseudo-class-selectors/You could create a class and use the class when you define all of your future \'s that you want (or don\'t want) to be selected by the CSS.This would be done by writing and then in your css having the lines (and using the text-align command as an example) :
