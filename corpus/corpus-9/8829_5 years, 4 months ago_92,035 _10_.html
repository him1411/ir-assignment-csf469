I was working on fragments and came across two things Activity and FragmentActivity which are used several times. I want to know that is there any difference between these two, because when I changed Activity with FragmentActivity, it had no effect on the app.A FragmentActivity is a subclass of Activity that was built for the Android Support Package. The FragmentActivity class adds a couple new methods to ensure compatibility with older versions of Android, but other than that, there really isn\'t much of a difference between the two. Just make sure you change all calls to getLoaderManager() and getFragmentManager() to getSupportLoaderManager() and getSupportFragmentManager() respectively.Fragment is a part of an activity, which contributes its own UI to that activity. Fragment can be thought like a sub activity. Where as the complete screen with which user interacts is called as activity. An activity can contain multiple fragments.Fragments are mostly a sub part of an activity.An activity may contain 0 or multiple number of fragments based on the screen size. A fragment can be reused in multiple activities, so it acts like a reusable component in activities.A fragment can\'t exist independently. It should be always part of an activity. Where as activity can exist with out any fragment in it.You can get all the functionality of Activity from FragmentActivity. In fact, FragmentActivity has more functionality).Using FragmentActivity you can easily build tab and swap format. For each tab you can use different Fragment (Fragments are reusable). So for any FragmentActivity you can reuse the same Fragment.Still you can use Activity for single pages like list down something and edit element of the list in next page.Also remember to use Activity if you are using android.app.Fragment; use FragmentActivity if you are using android.support.v4.app.Fragment. Never attach a android.support.v4.app.Fragment to an android.app.Activity, as this will cause an exception to be thrown.
