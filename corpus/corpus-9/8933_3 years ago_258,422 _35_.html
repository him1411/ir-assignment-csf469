How can I install the MySQLdb module for Python using pip?It\'s easy to do, but hard to remember the correct spelling:Note: Some dependencies might have to be in place when running the above command. Some hints on how to install these on various platforms:if that fails, tryStarting from a fresh Ubuntu 14.04.2 system, these two commands were needed:Just doing the "pip install" by itself did not work.From http://codeinthehole.com/writing/how-to-set-up-mysql-for-python-on-ubuntu/I had problems installing the 64-bit version of MySQLdb on Windows via Pip (problem compiling sources)  [32bit version installed ok]. Managed to install the compiled MySQLdb from the .whl file available from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ The .whl file can then be installed via pip as document in https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#installing-from-wheelsFor example if you save in C:/ the you can install viapip install c:/MySQL_python-1.2.5-cp27-none-win_amd64.whlFollow-up: if you have a 64bit version of Python installed, then you want to install the 64-bit AMD version of MySQLdb from the link above [i.e. even if you have a Intel processor]. If you instead try and install the 32-bit version, I think you get the unsupported wheel error in comments below. well this worked for me:this is for python 3.xI tried all the option but was not able to get it working on Redhat platform.\nI did the following to make it work:- Once the package was installed was able to import module as follows in the interpreter:-I had the same problem too.Follow these steps if you are on Windows.\nGo to:\n1.My Computer\n2.System Properties\n3.Advance System Settings\n4. Under the "Advanced" tab click the button that says "Environment Variables"\n5. Then under System Variables you have to add / change the following variables: PYTHONPATH and Path. Here is a paste of what my variables look like:\npython path: path:See this  link  for referenceu can go to this website http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mysqlclient\nto download the packageIf you are use Raspberry Pi [Raspbian OS]There are need to be install pip command at first So that just install SequentlyThe above answer is great, but there may be some problems when we using pip to install MySQL-python in Windows for example,It needs some files that are associated with Visual Stdio .One solution is  installing VS2008 or 2010\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6Obviously,it cost too much.Another way is the answer of  @bob90937 . I am here to do something to add.  with http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs, u can download many  Windows binaries of many scientific open-source extension packages for the official CPython distribution of the Python programming language.Back to topic,we can choose the MySQL-python(py2) or Mysqlclient(py3)   and use pip install   to install. it gives us Great convenience! For Python3 I needed to do this:First    Then put the code below into init.py(projectname/init.py)My environment (python3.5,django1.10) and it work for me!Hope help!!If pip3 isn\'t working, you can try:
