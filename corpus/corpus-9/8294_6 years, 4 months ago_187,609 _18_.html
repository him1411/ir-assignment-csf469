I need to get a String[] out of a Set<String>, but I don\'t know how to do it. The following fails:How can I fix it so that it works?Use the Set#toArray(T[]) method taking a typed array argument of the same size.A different size can also, but that would force the toArray() method to create a new array to return instead of reusing the provided argument, which may end up to be less efficient. See also the source code of AbstractCollection#toArray().In Java 8 we can use streams API:We can also make use of the overloaded version of toArray() which takes IntFunction<A[]> generator as:The purpose of the generator function here is to take an integer (size of desired array) and produce an array of desired size. I personally prefer the former approach using method reference than the later one using lambda expression.Use  toArray(T[] a) method:Guava style:more info: https://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/FluentIterable.htmlI was facing the same situation.I begin by declaring the structures I need:Set<String> myKeysInSet   = null; \n String[] myArrayOfString = null;In my case, I have a JSON object and I need all the keys in this JSON to be stored in an array of strings. Using the GSON library, I use JSON.keySet() to get the keys and move to my Set :myKeysInSet = json_any.keySet();With this, I have a Set structure with all the keys, as I needed it. So I just need to the values to my Array of Strings. See the code below:myArrayOfString = myKeysInSet.toArray(new String[myKeysInSet.size()]);This was my first answer in StackOverflow. \nSorry for any error :D
