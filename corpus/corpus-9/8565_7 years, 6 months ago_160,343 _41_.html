Is there a common way to show a big image and enable the user to zoom in and out and pan the image?Until now I found two ways: I\'ve just given TouchImageView a new update. It now includes Double Tap Zoom and Fling in addition to Panning and Pinch Zoom. The code below is very dated. You can check out the github project to get the latest code.Place TouchImageView.java in your project. It can then be used the same as\nImageView. Example:If you are using TouchImageView in xml, then you must provide the full package\nname, because it is a custom view. Example:Note: I\'ve removed my prior answer, which included some very old code and now link straight to the most updated code on github.If you are interested in putting TouchImageView in a ViewPager, refer to this answer.I adapted some code to create a TouchImageView that supports multitouch (>2.1).\nIt is inspired by the book Hello, Android! (3rd edition)It is contained within the following 3 files\nTouchImageView.java\nWrapMotionEvent.java\nEclairMotionEvent.javaTouchImageView.javaWrapMotionEvent.javaEclairMotionEvent.javaI used a WebView and loaded the image from the memory viaThe WebView handles all the panning zooming and scrolling. If you use wrap_content the webview won\'t be bigger then the image and no white areas are shown. \nThe WebView is the better ImageView ;)You could also try out http://code.google.com/p/android-multitouch-controller/The library is really great, although initially a little hard to grasp.In Response to Janusz original question, there are several ways to achieve this all of which vary in their difficulty level and have been stated below. Using a web view is good, but it is very limited in terms of look and feel and controllability. If you are drawing a bitmap from a canvas, the most versatile solutions that have been proposed seems to be MikeOrtiz\'s, Robert Foss\'s and/or what Jacob Nordfalk suggested. There is a great example for incorporating the android-multitouch-controller by PaulBourke, and is great for having the multi-touch support and alltypes of custom views. Personally, if you are simply drawing a canvas to a bitmap and then displaying it inside and ImageView and want to be able to zoom into and move around using multi touch, I find MikeOrtiz\'s solution as the easiest. However, for my purposes the code from the Git that he has provided seems to only work when his TouchImageView custom ImageView class is the only child or provide the layout params as:Unfortunately due to my layout design, I needed "wrap_content" for "layout_height". When I changed it to this the image was cropped at the bottom and I couldn\'t scroll or zoom to the cropped region.\nSo I took a look at the Source for ImageView just to see how Android implemented "onMeasure" and changed MikeOrtiz\'s to suit. Here resolveSize(int,int) is a "Utility to reconcile a desired size with constraints imposed by a MeasureSpec, where :Parameters:Returns:So essentially providing a behaviour a little more similar to the original ImageView class when the image is loaded. Some more changes could be made to support a greater variety of screens which modify the aspect ratio. But for now I Hope this helps. Thanks to MikeOrtiz for his original code, great work.I just integrated Robert Foss\'s TouchImageView: it worked perfectly out of the box! Thanks!I just modified a bit the code so I could be able to instantiate it from my layout.xml.Just add two constructorsand transform the old constructor into an init method:@Robert Foss, @Mike Ortiz, thank you very much for your work. I merged your work, and completed Robert classes for android > 2.0 with Mike additional work.As result of my work I present Android Touch Gallery, based on ViewPager and used modificated TouchImageView. Images loading by URL and you can zoom and drag them. You can find it here https://github.com/Dreddik/AndroidTouchGalleryTry using ZoomView for zooming any other view.http://code.google.com/p/android-zoom-view/ it\'s easy, free and fun to use!Adding to @Mike\'s answer. I also needed double tap to restore the image to the original dimensions when first viewed. So I added a whole heap of "orig..." instance variables and added the SimpleOnGestureListener which did the trick.This is a very late addition to this thread but I\'ve been working on an image view that supports zoom and pan and has a couple of features I haven\'t found elsewhere. This started out as a way of displaying very large images without causing OutOfMemoryErrors, by subsampling the image when zoomed out and loading higher resolution tiles when zoomed in. It now supports use in a ViewPager, rotation manually or using EXIF information (90\xc2\xb0 stops), override of selected touch events using OnClickListener or your own GestureDetector or OnTouchListener, subclassing to add overlays, pan while zooming, and fling momentum.It\'s not intended as a general use replacement for ImageView so doesn\'t extend it, and doesn\'t support display of images from resources, only assets and external files. It requires SDK 10.Source is on GitHub, and there\'s a sample that illustrates use in a ViewPager.https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-viewYou can try using the LayoutParams for thisZoomIn = zoom(true);\nZoomOut = zoom(false);and drawable folder should have bticn image file.\nperfectly works :)Something like below will do it.For viewing complete program see here: Program to zoom image in android
