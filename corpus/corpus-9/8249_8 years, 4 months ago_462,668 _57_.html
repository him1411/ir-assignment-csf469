I need a solution for auto-adjusting the width and height of an iframe to barely fit its content. The point is that the width and height can be changed after the iframe has been loaded. I guess I need an event action to deal with the change in dimensions of the body contained in the iframe.Cross-browser jQuery plug-in.Cross-bowser, cross domain library that uses mutationObserver to keep iFrame sized to the content and postMessage to communicate between iFrame and host page. Works with or without jQuery.All solutions given thus far only account for a once off resize. You mention you want to be able to resize the iFrame after the contents are modified. In order to do this, you need to execute a function inside the iFrame (once the contents are changed, you need to fire an event to say that the contents have changed).I was stuck with this for a while, as code inside the iFrame seemed limited to the DOM inside the iFrame (and couldn\'t edit the iFrame), and code executed outside the iFrame was stuck with the DOM outside the iFrame (and couldn\'t pick up an event coming from inside the iFrame).The solution came from discovering (via assistance from a colleague) that jQuery can be told what DOM to use. In this case, the DOM of the parent window.As such, code such as this does what you need (when run inside the iFrame) :If the iframe content is from the same domain this should work great. It does require jQuery though.To have it resize dynamically you could do this:Then on the page that the iframe loads add this:Here is a cross-browser solution if you don\'t want to use jQuery:one-liner solution for embeds:\nstarts with a min-size and increases to content size. no need for script tags.I am using this code to autoadjust height of all iframes (with class autoHeight) when they loads on page.

This hides the scrollbars of the iFrame with full width!source: set iframe auto heightall can not work using above methods.javascript:html:Env: IE 10, Windows 7 x64After I have tried everything on the earth, this really works for me.index.htmlI slightly modified Garnaph\'s great solution above.  It seemed like his solution modified the iframe size based upon the size right before the event.  For my situation (email submission via an iframe) I needed the iframe height to change right after submission.  For example show validation errors or "thank you" message after submission.  I just eliminated the nested click() function and put it into my iframe html:Worked for me, but not sure about cross browser functionality.I figured out another solution after some experimenting. I originally tried the code marked as \'best answer\' to this question and it didn\'t work. My guess is because my iframe in my program at the time was dynamically generated. Here is the code I used (it worked for me):Javascript inside the iframe that is being loaded:It is necessary to add 4 or more pixels to the height to remove scroll bars (some weird bug/effect of iframes). The width is even stranger, you are safe to add 18px to the width of the body. Also make sure that you have the css for the iframe body applied (below).Here is the html for the iframe:Here is all the code within my iframe:I have done testing in chrome and a little in firefox (in windows xp).
