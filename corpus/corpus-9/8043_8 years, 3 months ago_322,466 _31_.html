I use the following code to convert an Object array to a String array :But I wonder if there is another way to do this, something like :But this would cause a runtime error: Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.String;What\'s the correct way to do it ? Another alternative to System.arraycopy:System.arraycopy is probably the most efficient way, but for aesthetics, I\'d prefer:I see that some solutions have been provided but not any causes so I will explain this in detail as I believe it is as important to know what were you doing wrong that just to get "something" that works from the given replies.First, let\'s see what Oracle has to sayIt may not look important but as you\'ll see it is... So what does the following line fail? All object in the list are String but it does not convert them, why?Probably, many of you would think that this code is doing the same, but it does not.When in reality the written code is doing something like this. The javadoc is saying it! It will instatiate a new array, what it will be of Objects!!!So tList.toArray is instantiating a Objects and not Strings...Therefore, the natural solution that has not been mentioning in this thread, but it is what Oracle recommends is the followingHope it is clear enough.In Java 8:To convert an array of other types:The google collections framework offers quote a good transform method,so you can transform your Objects into Strings. The only downside is that it has to be from Iterable to Iterable but this is the way I would do it:This take you away from using arrays,but I think this would be my prefered way. If you want to get a String representation of the objects in your array, then yes, there is no other way to do it.If you know your Object array contains Strings only, you may also do (instread of calling toString()): The only case when you could use the cast to String[] of the Object_Array would be if the array it references would actually be defined as String[] , e.g. this would work:This one is nice, but doesn\'t work as mmyers noticed, because of the square brackets:Arrays.toString(objectArray).split(",")This one is ugly but works:Arrays.toString(objectArray).replaceFirst("^\\\\[", "").replaceFirst("\\\\]$", "").split(",")If you use this code you must be sure that the strings returned by your objects\' toString() don\'t contain commas.For your idea, actually you are approaching the success, but if you do like this should be fine:BTW, using the Arrays utility method is quite good and make the code elegant.You can use type-converter. \nTo convert an array of any types to array of strings you can register your own converter:and use itEasily change without any headche \nConvert any object array to string array\n        Object drivex[] = {1,2};
