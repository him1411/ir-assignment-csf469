Jonathan suggest here: Xcode Includes .xib files that have been deleted! that cleaning all targets and empty the caches will fix the problem with Xcode including deleted .xib files but i cannot find a way to empty the cache in Xcode 4.Anyone know\'s how to do that in Xcode 4?Command-Option-Shift-K to clean out the build folder. Even better, quit Xcode and clean out ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData manually. Remove all its contents because there\'s a bug where Xcode will run an old version of your project that\'s in there somewhere. (Xcode 4.2 will show you the Derived Data folder: choose Window > Organizer and switch to the Projects tab. Click the right-arrow to the right of the Derived Data folder name.)In the simulator, choose iOS Simulator > Reset Content and Settings.Finally, for completeness, you can delete the contents of /var/folders; some caching happens there too.WARNING: Deleting /var/folders can cause issues, and you may need to repair or reinstall your operating system after doing so.EDIT: I have just learned that if you are afraid to grapple with /var/folders/ you can use the following command in the Terminal to delete in a more targeted way:EDIT: For certain Swift-related problems I have found it useful to delete ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode. You lose a lot when you do this, like your spare copies of the downloaded documentation doc sets, but it can be worth it.Command-Option-Shift-K should do it. Alternatively, go to product menu, press the option key, now the option "Clean" will change to "Clean Build Folder ..." select that option. I found another way in addition to command+option+shift+K. In XCode 4.2 there is an organizer that can be opened from top-right icon. You can clean all archives and saved project options from there. This helped my situation (I was seeing old removed files in the mainBundle).In addition to doing the following, you may experience this issue if your app\'s Storyboard\'s files are localized. First, do each of these:What finally worked for me was re-generating the storyboard localization files and deleting the English localization (which was unneeded because the Base Locale is English). To reload your Storyboard strings, see this answer on StackOverflow. I had noticed that the non-text parts of my Storyboard were being updated, but not the localized text. If you have a localization in your app, I would recommend checking to make sure your localizations are updated (even if they\'re .strings files).I have been pulling out hair from my head because I thought that I had the same problem. When building the app I didn\'t get the same result on my iPhone as on the simulator.The problem was that I had somehow made a localized version of the MainStoryboard.storyboard file. So when I ran the app on  my phone it showed the danish version... and the simulator showed the english version.Yeah I\'m new! :)To delete all derived data and the module cache in /var/folders use this little ruby script.This just solved a fatal error: malformed or corrupted AST file: \'Unable to load module "/var/folders/ error for me.I had some problems with Xcode 5.1 crashing on me, when I opened the doc window.I am not sure of the cause of it, because I was also updating docsets, while I opened the window.Well, in Xcode 5 the modules directory now resides within the derived data folder, which I for obvious reasons didn\'t delete. I deleted the contents of ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ModuleCache and the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Xcode.plist and everything then seems to work, after I restarted Xcode.You have to be careful about the xib file.  I tried all the above and nothing worked for me.  I was using custom UIButtons defined in the xib, and realized it might be related to the fact that I had assigned attributes there which were not changing programmatically.  If you\'ve defined images or text there, remove them.  When I did, my programmatic changes began to take effect.Here\'s my shell script solution, which deletes derived data and cleans a project\'s cached assets, for Xcode 4, 5 and 6.Sometimes, simply calling rm -rf on the Derived Data directory leaves a lingering file or two, but my script loops until all files are deleted.I tried almost everything but could not help,what helped me was disabling SIP(System Integration Protection) n it works,I do not know what happens when and how but system file get confused somewhere and causes this...though there might be risks to disabling this obviouslyhere is how1.Power on your Mac and hold down the [command]+[R] keys to access the Recovery Partition.2.From the Recovery Partition, click Utilities from the menu bar, and then select Terminal.3.Enter the following command into Terminal and press Enter to execute it:\ncsrutil disable4.Once the command has executed, exit the Terminal and reboot the Mac. When you log back into OS X, SIP will be disabled.When using a "Data Model" , there are options in the inspector to\ngenerare classes, for me this was the case as there was already a class\nwith the existing name. Codegen: solved it for me.
