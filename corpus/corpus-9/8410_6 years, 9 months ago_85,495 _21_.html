I am trying to customize the format for git log. I want all commits to be shown in one line. Each line should only show the first line of the commit message.\nI found out that git log --pretty=short should do the trick but on my computer it shows the full log as git log does (besides the time stamp).Further, I tried to use the placeholders as defined in the man page. Though, I could not find a command to shorten the log message. I tried this line git log --pretty=format:\'%h : %s\' which shows the shorted hash %hand the full message %s in one line.I am using git version 1.7.3.1.msysgit.0 on Vista.Maybe it has something to do with the way I write my commit messages. Here is an example:So, with the example given I only want to be output Added some functionality. prepended by the shortend hash.Have you tried this?The problem is probably that you are missing an empty line after the first line. The command above usually works for me, but I just tested on a commit without empty second line. I got the same result as you: the whole message on one line.Empty second line is a standard in git commit messages. The behaviour you see was probably implemented on purpose. The first line of a commit message is meant to be a short description. If you cannot make it in a single line you can use several, but git considers everything before the first empty line to be the "short description". oneline prints the whole short description, so all your 3 rows.Does git log --oneline do what you want?You can define a global alias so you can invoke a short log in a more comfortable way:git config --global alias.slog "log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit"Then you can call it using git slog (it even works with autocompletion if you have it enabled).Better and easier git log by making an alias. Paste the code below to terminal just once.Output Output changed lines   Further Reading.\nhttps://coderwall.com/p/euwpig/a-better-git-log\nAdvanced Reading.\nhttp://durdn.com/blog/2012/11/22/must-have-git-aliases-advanced-examples/Without commit messages, only the hash:if you want to always use git log in such way you could add git alias bygit config --global alias.log log --onelineafter that git log will print what normally would be printed by git log --oneline
