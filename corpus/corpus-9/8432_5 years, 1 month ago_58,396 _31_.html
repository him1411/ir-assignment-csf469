I am reading for SCJP and I have a question regarding this line:Identifiers must start with a letter, a currency character ($), or a\n  connecting character such as the underscore ( _ ). Identifiers cannot\n  start with a number!It states that a valid identifier name can start with a connecting character such as underscore. I thought underscores were the only valid option? What other connecting characters are there?Here is a list of connecting characters. These are characters used to connect words.http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Pc/list.htmThis compiles on Java 7.An example. In this case tp is the name of a column and the value for a given row.The followingprints$ _ \xc2\xa2 \xc2\xa3 \xc2\xa4 \xc2\xa5 \xd8\x8b \xe0\xa7\xb2 \xe0\xa7\xb3 \xe0\xa7\xbb \xe0\xab\xb1 \xe0\xaf\xb9 \xe0\xb8\xbf \xe1\x9f\x9b \xe2\x80\xbf \xe2\x81\x80 \xe2\x81\x94 \xe2\x82\xa0 \xe2\x82\xa1 \xe2\x82\xa2 \xe2\x82\xa3 \xe2\x82\xa4 \xe2\x82\xa5 \xe2\x82\xa6 \xe2\x82\xa7 \xe2\x82\xa8 \xe2\x82\xa9 \xe2\x82\xaa \xe2\x82\xab \xe2\x82\xac \xe2\x82\xad \xe2\x82\xae \xe2\x82\xaf \xe2\x82\xb0 \xe2\x82\xb1 \xe2\x82\xb2 \xe2\x82\xb3 \xe2\x82\xb4 \xe2\x82\xb5 \xe2\x82\xb6 \xe2\x82\xb7 \xe2\x82\xb8 \xe2\x82\xb9 \xea\xa0\xb8 \xef\xb7\xbc \xef\xb8\xb3 \xef\xb8\xb4 \xef\xb9\x8d \xef\xb9\x8e \xef\xb9\x8f \xef\xb9\xa9 \xef\xbc\x84 \xef\xbc\xbf \xef\xbf\xa0 \xef\xbf\xa1 \xef\xbf\xa5 \xef\xbf\xa6iterate through the whole 65k chars and ask Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(c).\nThe answer is : "undertie" decimal 8255The definitive specification of a legal Java identifier can be found in the Java Language Specification.Here is a List of connector Characters in Unicode.

Use the Character class APIs to get more details.The list of characters you can use inside your identifiers (rather than just at the start) is much more fun:The list is:It includes most of the control characters! I mean bells and shit! You can make your source code ring the fn bell! Or use characters which will only be displayed sometimes, like the soft hyphen.One of the most, well, fun characters that is allowed in Java identifiers (however not at the start) is the unicode character named "Zero Width Non Joiner" (&zwnj;, U+200C, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_non-joiner).I had this once in a piece of XML inside an attribute value holding a reference to another piece of that XML. Since the ZWNJ is "zero width" it cannot be seen (except when walking along with the cursor, it is displayed right on the character before). It also couldn\'t be seen in the logfile and/or console output. But it was there all the time: copy & paste into search fields got it and thus did not find the referred position. Typing the (visible part of the) string into the search field however found the referred position. Took me a while to figure this out.Typing a Zero-Width-Non-Joiner is actually quite easy (too easy) when using the European keyboard layout, at least in its German variant, e.g. "Europatastatur 2.02" - it is reachable with AltGr + ".", two keys which unfortunately are located directly next to each other on most keyboards and can easily be hit together accidentally.Back to Java: I thought well, you could write some code like this:with the second i appended by a zero-width-non-joiner (can\'t do that in the above code snipped in stackoverflow\'s editor), but that didn\'t work. IntelliJ (16.3.3) did not complain, but JavaC (Java 8) did complain about an already defined identifier - it seems JavaC actually allows the ZWNJ character as part of an identifier, but when using reflection to see what it does, the ZWNJ character is stripped off the identifier - something that characters like \xe2\x80\xbf aren\'t.
