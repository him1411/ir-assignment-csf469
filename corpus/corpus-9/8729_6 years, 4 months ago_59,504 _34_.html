Am building an app using Django as my workhorse. All has been well so far - specified db settings, configured static directories, urls, views etc. But trouble started sneaking in the moment I wanted to render my own beautiful and custom 404.html and 500.html pages.I read the docs on custom error handling, and set necessary configurations in UrlsConf, created corresponding views and added the 404.html and the 500.html to my app\'s template directory (specified in the settings.py too).But the docs say you can actually view custom error views until Debug is Off, so I did turn it off to test my stuff, and that\'s when stuff goes berserk!Not only do I fail to view the custom 404.html (actually, it loads, but because my error pages each contain a graphic error message -as some nice image), the source of the erro page loads, but nothing else loads! Not even linked CSS or Javascript!Generally, once I set DEBUG = False, all views will load, but any linked content (CSS, Javascript, Images, etc) wont load! What\'s happening? Is there something am missing about Static files and the Debug setting?With debug turned off Django won\'t handle static files for you any more - your production web server (Apache or something) should take care of that.If you still need to server static locally (e.g. for testing without debug) you can run devserver in insecure mode:If you are using the static serve view in development, you have to have DEBUG = True :WarningThis will only work if DEBUG is True.That\'s because this view is grossly\n  inefficient and probably insecure.\n  This is only intended for local\n  development, and should never be used\n  in production.Docs: serving static files in developentEDIT: You could add some urls just to test your 404 and 500 templates, just use the generic view direct_to_template in your urls.You can use WhiteNoise to serve static files in production.Install:And change your wsgi.py file to this:And you\'re good to go!Credit to Handlebar Creative Blog.You actually can serve static files in a production Django app, securely and without DEBUG=True.Rather than using Django itself, use dj_static in your WSGI file (github):Just open your project urls.py, then find this if statement.You can change settings.DEBUG on True and it will work always. But if your project is a something serious then you should to think about other solutions mentioned above. In django 1.10 you can write so:You can debug this in many different ways. Here\'s my approach.localsettings.py:urls.py:Be sure to read the docs ;)https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/howto/static-files/#limiting-use-to-debug-trueAlthough it\'s not safest, but you can change in the source code. navigate to Python/2.7/site-packages/django/conf/urls/static.pyThen edit like following:So then if settings.debug==False it won\'t effect on the code, also after running try python manage.py runserver --runserver to run static files.NOTE: Information should only be used for testing onlySupport for string view arguments to url() is deprecated and will be removed in Django 1.10My solution is just small correction to Conrado solution above.
