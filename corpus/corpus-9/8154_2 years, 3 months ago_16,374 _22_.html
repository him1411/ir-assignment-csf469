Today I uploaded my first build of first app successfully to App Store for beta testing. After making a few changes, when I tried to submit the new archive again Xcode crashed, and still crashes.It\'s the log:Note: I can validate the Archive without error. Will re-installing XCode help me to fix it?Close any projects or workspace windows you have open in Xcode but leave Organizer window open and re-submit worked for me.Just got this problem. Seems to work if you close all other Xcode windows but keep the organizer window open.Had the same problem - uploaded my .ipa through the Application Loader.The original question is: "Will re-installing XCode help me to fix it?" \nThe answer is: "No." Re-installation does not help the problem. The bug is pretty serious though, since submitting an app is central to app development. A fix should be in the App Store asap. Hence updating later may help. Following steps worked for me:Had this problem today. I was only able to successfully upload the Archive when the organizer window was open and all Xcode projects were closed.I created an .ipa file using the Export utility in Organizer, then ran Application Loader. Selected the \'Deliver Your App\' button. Choose the new created ipa file and the file appeared in iTuneConnect under the pre-release tab as expected for TestFlight distribution.Had the same problem today. Problem turned out I still had the Reveal Framework included in my project. Make sure you don\'t have any non-public API usage in your archive. I encountered similar situation. However, my solution was somehow different.Noticing that you are trying to submit next build, please make sure your previous build is excluded from App Store submit form before uploading new build.I\'m not sure why this has to be an issue, but it seems like that the submit form should be cleared before receiving new build.You might need to accept some new user agreements, try going to Apple Developer Member Center and see if they\'re any new agreements you need to accept.If that doesn\'t work try this: open Xcode and go to [ Preferences ] -> [ Accounts ], select your Apple ID and click on [ View Details... ]. Once you do that click on the refresh icon at the bottom left. If you\'re missing anything it will let you know.If both of those don\'t work go back to the archive window in XCode and click on export on the right-hand side underneath the submit button. Save it where ever you want but remember the location. Once exported go back to XCode and go to [ Open Developer Tools ] -> [ Application Loader ]. You can submit your new version of your app through that.If none of those work then I have no idea, maybe someone else knows.I had the same issue at June 17 night. I reinstalled my Xcode, and had the same issue. Looks like Apple updated something at that day, since I noticed the website of Member Center, the MAC certificate is also there. (YES!!! apple only charge once for iPhone and Mac)If that doesn\'t work, than it could also be that the used Certificate has expired. So check if your Certificate is still valid.Archive using Xcode 6.4, submit using Xcode 7. Submission successful
