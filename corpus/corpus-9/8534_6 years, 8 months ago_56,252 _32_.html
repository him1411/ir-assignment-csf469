Now I have to download and install the Android SDK abd AVD Manager, and then install the the APIs, tools through the UI. Is there a way to automate this process?The closer you can get to automation probably is:android provide these options for automatic updates:If you want to list which packages are available for installation you can useand you\'ll obtain an ordered list of packages, for exampleAlso you can limit the update only to a desired component if you use the --filter optionwhere component is one or more ofor can be one or more specific identifiers. For instance, if you just want to download a small set of specific packages, you could do this:and you\'ll just get the platform tools, api level 16 and support package jar. This is really handy if you\'re building a build machine only and would have to pay for downloading all the extra stuff that you\'ll never use.To see the available options you can use --help, for exampleLatest versions introduce sdkmanager, a command line tool that allows you to view, install, update, and uninstall packages for the Android SDK.The sdkmanager tool is provided in the Android SDK Tools package (25.2.3 and higher) and is located in android_sdk/tools/bin/.so, to update the packages runto accept the licensesThis didn\'t work for me... so I ended up here:i use this to install and update the sdk on travis-ciTo answer all licenses with \'y\', you can try this in the script:For any one still searching for a method to download all Android packages, I have wrote a script to do that. It will download all non-obsoleted packages.  You can also see it on my Github repoThe good:The downsides:Starting with Android Plugin for Gradle version 2.2.0, missing SDK components get downloaded automatically.In newer android versions (e.g. 25.2.5) we should use sdkmanager (instead of the android command)Example of installing a package:Command to get a list of all available packages:This web-page lists download links for the SDK-tools:Here is a link to an open-source repository docker-android which can install android in a Docker image.You may also find the answers in this SO Question: Automatically accept all SDK licences useful.I put together a ruby script that downloads and install the SDK without prompting which might help.\nhttps://github.com/ayvazj/andenvYet another script to download only needed, non-{obsolute,source,emulator-image,doc} packages:Some parts are taken from other answers in this thread.
