This question already has an answer here:I am trying to read a simple text file into a String. Of course there is the usual way of getting the input stream and iterating with readLine() and reading contents into String. Having done this hundreds of times in past, I just wondered how can I do this in minimum lines of code? Isn\'t there something in java like String fileContents = XXX.readFile(myFile/*File*/) .. rather anything that looks as simple as this?I know there are libraries like Apache Commons IO which provide such simplifications or even I can write a simple Util class to do this. But all that I wonder is - this is a so frequent operation that everyone needs then why doesn\'t Java provide such simple function? Isn\'t there really a single method somewhere to read a file into string with some default or specified encoding?Yes, you can do this in one line (though for robust IOException handling you wouldn\'t want to).This uses a java.util.Scanner, telling it to delimit the input with \\Z, which is the end of the string anchor. This ultimately makes the input have one actual token, which is the entire file, so it can be read with one call to next().There is a constructor that takes a File and a String charSetName (among many other overloads). These two constructor may throw FileNotFoundException, but like all Scanner methods, no IOException can be thrown beyond these constructors.You can query the Scanner itself through the ioException() method if an IOException occurred or not. You may also want to explicitly close() the Scanner after you read the content, so perhaps storing the Scanner reference in a local variable is best.For completeness, these are some really good options if you have these very reputable and highly useful third party libraries:com.google.common.io.Files contains many useful methods. The pertinent ones here are:org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils also offer similar functionality:From Java 7 (API Description) onwards you can do:new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(filePath)));Where filePath is a String representing the file you want to load. You can use apache commons IO..This should work for you:Using Apache Commons IO.You can see de javadoc for the method for details.Don\'t write your own util class to do this - I would recommend using Guava, which is full of all kinds of goodness. In this case you\'d want either the Files class (if you\'re really just reading a file) or CharStreams for more general purpose reading. It has methods to read the data into a list of strings (readLines) or totally (toString).It has similar useful methods for binary data too. And then there\'s the rest of the library...I agree it\'s annoying that there\'s nothing similar in the standard libraries. Heck, just being able to supply a CharSet to a FileReader would make life a little simpler...Another alternative approach is:How do I create a Java string from the contents of a file?Other option is to use utilities provided open source libraries  \nhttp://commons.apache.org/io/api-1.4/index.html?org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.htmlWhy java doesn\'t provide such a common util API ?\na) to keep the APIs generic so that encoding, buffering etc is handled by the programmer.\nb) make programmers do some work  and write/share opensource util libraries :D ;-)Sadly, no.I agree that such frequent operation should have easier implementation than copying of input line by line in loop, but you\'ll have to either write helper method or use external library.I discovered that the accepted answer actually doesn\'t always work, because \\\\Z may occur in the file. Another problem is that if you don\'t have the correct charset a whole bunch of unexpected things may happen which may cause the scanner to read only a part of the file.Therefore, I propose a minor tweak that still doesn\'t always work, but at least throws an Exception in these cases:below is the simple code to read contents of file into string
