A jQuery plugin is applying an inline style (display:block). I\'m feeling lazy and want to override it with display:none.What\'s the best (lazy) way?Update: while the following solution works, there\'s a much easier method. See below.Here\'s what I came up with, and I hope this comes in handy -  to you or anybody else:This will remove that inline style.I\'m not sure this is what you wanted. You wanted to override it, which, as pointed out already, is easily done by $(\'#element\').css(\'display\', \'inline\').What I was looking for was a solution to REMOVE the inline style completely.\nI need this for a plugin I\'m writing where I have to temporarily set some inline CSS values, but want to later remove them; I want the stylesheet to take back control.\nI could do it by storing all of its original values and then putting them back inline, but this solution feels much cleaner to me.Here it is in plugin format:If you include this plugin in the page before your script, you can then just calland that should do the trick.Update: I now realized that all this is futile.\nYou can simply set it to blank:and it\'ll automatically be removed for you.Here\'s a quote from the docs:Setting the value of a style property to an empty string \xe2\x80\x94 e.g. $(\'#mydiv\').css(\'color\', \'\') \xe2\x80\x94 removes that property from an element if it has already been directly applied, whether in the HTML style attribute, through jQuery\'s .css() method, or through direct DOM manipulation of the style property. It does not, however, remove a style that has been applied with a CSS rule in a stylesheet or <style> element.I don\'t think jQuery is doing any magic here; it seems the style object does this natively..removeAttr("style") to just get rid of the whole style tag....attr("style") to test the value and see if an inline style exists....attr("style",newValue) to set it to something elseThe easiest way to remove inline styles (generated by jQuery) would be: The inline code should disappear and your object should adapt the style predefined in your CSS files.Worked for me!You can set the style using jQuery\'s css method:you can create a jquery plugin like this :usageThe Lazy way (which will cause future designers to curse your name and murder you in your sleep):Disclaimer: I do not advocate this approach, but it certainly is the lazy way.If you want to remove a property within a style attribute \xe2\x80\x93 not just set it to something else \xe2\x80\x93 you make use of the removeProperty() method:UPDATE:\nI\'ve made an interactive fiddle to play around with the different methods and their results. Apparently, there isn\'t much of a difference between set to empty string, set to faux value and removeProperty(). They all result in the same fallback \xe2\x80\x93 which is either a pre-given CSS rule or the browser\'s default value.In case the display is the only parameter from your style, you can run this command in order to remove all style:Means that if your element looked like this before:Now your element will look like this:Here is an inlineStyle selector filter I wrote that plugs into jQuery.In your case you could use this like:Change the plugin to no longer apply the style.  That would be much better than removing the style there-after.$el.css({\n    height : \'\',\n    \'margin-top\' : \'\'\n});etc...Just leave the 2nd param blank!
