Is there a way to limit the depth of a recursive file listing in linux?The command I\'m using at the moment is:But I\'ve got about 200 directories and each of them have 10\'s of directories. So it\'s just going to take far too long and hog too many system resources.All I\'m really interested in is the ownership and permissions information for the first level subdirectories:EDIT:Final choice of command:Checkout the -maxdepth flag of findHere I used 1 as max level depth, -type d means find only directories, which then ls -ld lists contents of, in long format.There is actually no exec of /bin/ls needed; Find has an option that does just that:To see only the one level of subdirectories you are interested in, add -mindepth to the same level as -maxdepth:When the details that get shown should be different, -printf can show any detail about a file in custom format; \nTo show the symbolic permissions and the owner name of the file, use -printf with %M and %u in the format.I noticed later you want the full ownership information, which includes\nthe group. Use %g in the format for the symbolic name, or %G for the group id (like also %U for numeric user id)This should give you just the details you need, for just the right files.I will give an example that shows actually different values for user and group:(Edited for readability: indented, shortened last line)Although the execution time is mostly irrelevant for this kind of command, increase in performance \nis large enough here to make it worth pointing it out:  Not only do we save creating a new process for each name - a huge task - \nthe information does not even need to be read, as find already knows it.tree -L 2 -u -g -p -dPrints the directory tree in a pretty format up to depth 2 (-L 2).\nPrint user (-u) and group (-g) and permissions (-p).\nPrint only directories (-d).\ntree has a lot of other useful options.
