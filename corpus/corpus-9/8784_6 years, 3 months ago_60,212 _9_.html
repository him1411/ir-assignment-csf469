Please tell me how to write javascript below in coffeescript.I think it\'s a useful convention for callbacks to come as the last argument to a function. This is usually the case with the Node.js API, for instance. So with that in mind:Granted, this adds the overhead of an extra function call to every setTimeout you make; but in today\'s JS interpreters, the performance drawback is insignificant unless you\'re doing it thousands of times per second. (And what are you doing setting thousands of timeouts per second, anyway?)Of course, a more straightforward approach is to simply name your callback, which tends to produce more readable code anyway (jashkenas is a big fan of this idiom):The parentheses are optional, but starting the line with a comma seemed messy to me.This will result in a roughly equivalent translation (thanks @Joel Mueller):Note that this isn\'t an exact translation because the anonymous function returns the result of calling something(param) instead of undefined, as in your snippet.I find this the best method to do the same, another option:
