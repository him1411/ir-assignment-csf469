Is there a way to rename a dictionary key, without reassigning its value to a new name and removing the old name key; and without iterating through dict key/value?\nIn case of OrderedDict, do the same, while keeping that key\'s position.For a regular dict, you can use:For an OrderedDict, I think you must build an entirely new one using a comprehension.  Modifying the key itself, as this question seems to be asking, is impractical because dict keys are usually immutable objects such as numbers, strings or tuples.  Instead of trying to modify the key, reassigning the value to a new key and removing the old key is how you can achieve the "rename" in python.  best method in 1 line:Using a check for newkey!=oldkey, this way you can do:You can use this OrderedDict recipe written by Raymond Hettinger and modify it to add a rename method, but this is going to be a O(N) in complexity:Example:output:
