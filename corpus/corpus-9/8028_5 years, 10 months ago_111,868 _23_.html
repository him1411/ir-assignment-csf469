Here, the square brackets are optional when the index is followed by another property:However, the square brackets are required in:In the latter, using the index number without the square brackets would get one:As an aside: the brackets are (also) used for segment-literal syntax, to refer to actual identifiers (not index numbers) that would otherwise be invalid. More details in What is a valid identifier?(Tested with Handlebars in YUI.)If undocumented features aren\'t your game, the same can be accomplished here:Then in a templateI wrote the above before I got a hold of I can\'t see you getting too far with handlebars if you aren\'t writing your own helpers.While you are looping in an array with each and if you want to access another array in the context of the current item you do it like this.Here is the example data.Here is the handlebars to get the first item in attr array.This will outputIf you want to use dynamic variablesThis won\'t work:You need to do:see handlebars lookup helper and handlebars subexpressions.Please try this, if you want to fetch first/last.The following syntax can also be used if the array is not named (just the array is passed to the template):
