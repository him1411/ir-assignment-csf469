What is the best way to add comments in erb files, if we do not want them to be generated into the html content? Use the <%# %> sequence, e.g.For RecordFor block comments:I have a Windows setup, and this <%-# %> sequence is the only one that works for me:Example:Since .erb is by definition "embedded ruby", you can embed every ruby code between: <%=  and the other: %>, typically all written in one line. In addition, ruby one-line comments start always with #, so the <%=# Comment %> style matches perfectly with both pure-ruby and erb styles for one-line comments.
