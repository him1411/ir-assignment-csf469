How do you check if an NSString begins with a certain character (the character *).The * is an indicator for the type of the cell, so I need the contents of this NSString without the *, but need to know if the * exists.You can use the -hasPrefix: method of NSString:Objective-C:Swift:You can use:hasPrefix works especially well.\nfor example if you were looking for a http url in a NSString, you would use componentsSeparatedByString to create an NSArray and the iterate the array using hasPrefix to find the elements that begin with http.   hasPrefix returns a Boolean value that indicates whether a given string matches the beginning characters of the receiver.parameter aString is a string that you are looking for\nReturn Value is YES if aString matches the beginning characters of the receiver, otherwise NO. Returns NO if aString is empty.Use characterAtIndex:. If the first character is an asterisk, use substringFromIndex: to get the string sans \'*\'.As a more general answer, try using the hasPrefix method. For example, the code below checks to see if a string begins with 10, which is the error code used to identify a certain problem.Another approach to do it..May it help someone...This might help? :)http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSString/characterAtIndex:Just search for the character at index 0 and compare it against the value you\'re looking for!This nice little bit of code I found by chance, and I have yet to see it suggested on Stack. It only works if the characters you want to remove or alter exist, which is convenient in many scenarios. If the character/s does not exist, it won\'t alter your NSString:This is how I use it:This one line is super easy to perform three actions in one:
