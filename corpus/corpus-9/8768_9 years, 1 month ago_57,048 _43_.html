What are attributes in .NET, what are they good for, and how do I create my own attributes?Metadata. Data about your objects/methods/properties. For example I might declare an Attribute called: DisplayOrder so I can easily control in what order properties should appear in the UI. I could then append it to a class and write some GUI components that extract the attributes and order the UI elements appropriately.Thereby ensuring that SomeInt is always displayed before SomeDate when working with my custom GUI components.However, you\'ll see them most commonly used outside of the direct coding environment. For example the Windows Designer uses them extensively so it knows how to deal with custom made objects. Using the BrowsableAttribute like so:Tells the designer not to list this in the available properties in the Properties window at design time for example.You could also use them for code-generation, pre-compile operations (such as Post-Sharp)  or run-time operations such as Reflection.Emit.\nFor example, you could write a bit of code for profiling that transparently wrapped every single call your code makes and times it. You could "opt-out" of the timing via an attribute that you place on particular methods.Declaring them is easy, just make a class that inherits from Attribute. And remember that when you use the attribute you can omit the suffix "attribute" the compiler will add that for you.Many people have answered but no one has mentioned this so far...Attributes are used heavily with reflection.  Reflection is already pretty slow.It is very worthwhile marking your custom attributes as being sealed classes to improve their runtime performance.It is also a good idea to consider where it would be appropriate to use place such an attribute, and to attribute your attribute (!) to indicate this via AttributeUsage.  The list of available attribute usages might surprise you:It\'s also cool that the AttributeUsage attribute is part of the AttributeUsage attribute\'s signature.  Whoa for circular dependencies!Attributes are a kind of meta data for tagging classes. This is often used in WinForms for example to hide controls from the toolbar, but can be implemented in your own application to enable instances of different classes to behave in specific ways. Start by creating an attribute:All attribute classes must have the suffix "Attribute" to be valid.\nAfter this is done, create a class that uses the attribute.Now you can check a specific class\' SortOrderAttribute (if it have one) by doing the following:If you want to read more about this you can always check out MSDN which have a pretty good description.\nI hope this helped you out!An attribute is a class that contains some bit of functionality that you can apply to objects in your code. To create one, create a class that inherits from System.Attribute.As for what they\'re good for... there are almost limitless uses for them.http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/dotnetattributes.aspxAttributes are like metadata applied to classes, methods or assemblies.They are good for any number of things (debugger visualization, marking things as obsolete, marking things as serializable, the list is endless).Creating your own custom ones is easy as pie. Start here:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sw480ze8(VS.71).aspxIn the project I\'m currently working on, there is a set of UI objects of various flavours and an editor to assembly these objects to create pages for use in the main application, a bit like the form designer in DevStudio. These objects exist in their own assembly and each object is a class derived from UserControl and has a custom attribute. This attribute is defined like this:and I apply it to a class like this:which is what the previous posters have said.To use the attribute, the editor has a Generic::List <Type> containing the control types. There is a list box which the user can drag from and drop onto the page to create an instance of the control. To populate the list box, I get the ControlDescriptionAttribute for the control and fill out an entry in the list:Note: the above is C++/CLI but it\'s not difficult to convert to C#\n(yeah, I know, C++/CLI is an abomination but it\'s what I have to work with :-( )You can put attributes on most things and there are whole range of predefined attributes. The editor mentioned above also looks for custom attributes on properties that describe the property and how to edit it.Once you get the whole idea, you\'ll wonder how you ever lived without them.As said, Attributes are relatively easy to create. The other part of the work is creating code that uses it. In most cases you will use reflection at runtime to alter behavior based on the presence of an attribute or its properties. There are also scenarios where you will inspect attributes on compiled code to do some sort of static analysis. For example, parameters might be marked as non-null and the analysis tool can use this as a hint.Using the attributes and knowing the appropriate scenarios for their use is the bulk of the work.Attributes are, essentially, bits of data you want to attach to your types (classes, methods, events, enums, etc.)The idea is that at run time some other type/framework/tool will query your type for the information in the attribute and act upon it.So, for example, Visual Studio can query the attributes on a 3rd party control to figure out which properties of the control should appear in the Properties pane at design time.Attributes can also be used in Aspect Oriented Programming to inject/manipulate objects at run time based on the attributes that decorate them and add validation, logging, etc. to the objects without affecting the business logic of the object.You can use custom attributes as a simple way to define tag values in sub classes without having to write the same code over and over again for each subclass.  I came across a nice concise example by John Waters of how to define and use custom attributes in your own code.There is a tutorial at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288454(VS.71).aspxTo get started creating an attribute, open a C# source file, type attribute and hit [TAB].  It will expand to a template for a new attribute.Attributes are also commonly used for Aspect Oriented Programming. For an example of this check out the PostSharp project.
