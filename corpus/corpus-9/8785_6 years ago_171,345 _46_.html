Can you round a number in javascript to 1 character after the decimal point (properly rounded)?I tried the *10, round, /10 but it leaves two decimals at the end of the int.Math.round( num * 10) / 10 works, here is an example...if you want it to have one decimal place, even when that would be a 0, then add...Using this principle, for reference, here is a handy little round function that takes precision...... usage ...... defaults to round to nearest whole number (precision 0) ...... and can be used to round to nearest 10 or 100 etc...... and correct handling of negative numbers ...... and can be combined with toFixed to format consistently as string ...If you use Math.round(5.01) you will get 5 instead of 5.0.If you use toFixed you run into rounding issues.If you want the best of both worlds combine the two:You might want to create a function for this:lodash has a round method:Docs.Source.I vote for toFixed(), but, for the record, here\'s another way that uses bit shifting to cast the number to an int.  So, it always rounds towards zero (down for positive numbers, up for negatives).But hey, since there are no function calls, it\'s wicked fast. :)And here\'s one that uses string matching:I don\'t recommend using the string variant, just sayin.Try with this:1) //round "original" to two decimals2) // round "original" to 1 decimal3) //round 8.111111 to 3 decimalsless complicated and easier to implement...with this, you can create a function to do:x = number, n = decimal-places:To complete the Best Answer:The input parameter number may "not" always be a number, in this case .toFixed does not exist. If your method does not work, plz post your code.However,you could accomplish the rounding off task as:Will give you 234.56SimilarlyWill give 234.5In this way you can use a variable in the place of the constant as used above.This seems to work reliably across anything I throw at it:It rounds up, so you may need to modify it according to use case. This should work:If you care about proper rounding up then:Else if you don\'t then you already have a reply from previous postsMath.round( num * 10) / 10 doesn\'t work.For example, 1455581777.8-145558160.4 gives you 1310023617.3999999.So only use num.toFixed(1)Little Angular filter if anyone wants it:use if via::)
