I often use the find command to search through source code, delete files, whatever. Annoyingly, because Subversion stores duplicates of each file in its .svn/text-base/ directories my simple searches end up getting lots of duplicate results. For example, I want to recursively search for uint in multiple messages.h and messages.cpp files:How can I tell find to ignore the .svn directories?Update: If you upgrade  your SVN client to version 1.7 this is no longer an issue.A key feature of the changes introduced in Subversion 1.7 is the centralization of working copy metadata storage into a single location. Instead of a .svn directory in every directory in the working copy, Subversion 1.7 working copies have just one .svn directory\xe2\x80\x94in the root of the working copy. This directory includes (among other things) an SQLite-backed database which contains all of the metadata Subversion needs for that working copy.For searching, can I suggest you look at ack ? It\'s a source-code aware find, and as such will automatically ignore many file types, including source code repository info such as the above.why not just The -not predicate negates everything that has .svn anywhere in the path.So in your case it would beAs follows:Or, alternatively based on a directory and not a path prefix:To ignore .svn, .git and other hidden directories (starting with a dot), try:Here is what I would do in your case:Emacs\' rgrep built-in command ignores .svn directory, and many more files you\'re probably not interested in when performing a find | grep. Here is what it uses by default:It ignores directories created by most version control systems, as well as generated files for many programming languages.\nYou could create an alias that invokes this command and replace find and grep patterns for your specific problems.GNU findI use grep for this purpose. Put this in your ~/.bashrcgrep automatically uses these options on invocationCreate a script called ~/bin/svnfind:This script behaves identically to a plain find command but it prunes out .svn directories. Otherwise the behavior is identical.Example:find . | grep -v \\.svn Why dont you pipe your command with grep which is easily understandable:Just thought I\'d add a simple alternative to Kaleb\'s and others\' posts (which detailed the use of the find -prune option, ack, repofind commands etc.) which is particularly applicable to the usage you have described in the question (and any other similar usages):For performance, you should always try to use find ... -exec grep ... + (thanks Kenji for pointing this out) or find ... | xargs egrep ... (portable) or find ... -print0 | xargs -0 egrep ... (GNU; works on filenames containing spaces) instead of find ... -exec grep ... \\;.The find ... -exec ... + and find | xargs form does not fork egrep for each file, but rather for a bunch of files at a time, resulting in much faster execution.When using the find | xargs form you can also use grep to easily and quickly prune .svn (or any directories or regular expression), i.e. find ... -print0 | grep -v \'/\\.svn\' | xargs -0 egrep ... (useful when you need something quick and can\'t be bothered to remember how to set up find\'s -prune logic.)The find | grep | xargs approach is similar to GNU find\'s -regex option (see ghostdog74\'s post), but is more portable (will also work on platforms where GNU find is not available.)In a source code repository, I generally want to do things only to the text files.The first line is all files, excluding CVS, SVN, and GIT repository files.The second line excludes all binary files.wcfind is a find wrapper script that I use to automagically remove .svn directories.I use find with the -not -path options.  I have not had good luck with prune.will find the groovy files not in the target directory path.  Try findrepo which is a simple wrapper around find/grep and much faster than ack\nYou would use it in this case like:This works for me in the Unix promptgfind . \\( -not -wholename \'*\\.svn*\' \\) -type f -name \'messages.*\'\n  -exec grep -Iw uint {} +The command above will list FILES that are not with .svn and do the grep you mentioned.i usually pipe the output through grep one more time removing .svn, in my use it isn\'t much slower.\ntypical example:ORTo resolve this problem, you can simply use this find condition:You can add more restriction like this:You can find more information about this in man page section "Operators":\nhttp://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?findNote that if you dofind . -type f -name \'messages.*\'then -print is implied when the whole expression (-type f -name \'messages.*\') is true, because there is no \'action\' (like -exec).While, to stop descending into certain directories, you should use anything that matches those directories and follow it by -prune (which is intended to stop descending into directories); like so:find . -type d -name \'.svn\' -pruneThis evaluates to True for the .svn directories, and we can use boolean short-circuit by following this by -o (OR), after which what follows after the -o is only checked when the first part is False, hence is not a .svn directory. In other words, the following:find . -type d -name \'.svn\' -prune -o -name \'message.*\' -exec grep -Iw uint {}will only evalute what is right of the -o, namely -name \'message.*\' -exec grep -Iw uint {}, for files NOT inside .svn directories.Note that because .svn is likely always a directory (and not for example a file), and in this case certainly isn\'t matching the name \'message.*\', you might as well leave out the -type d and do:find . -name \'.svn\' -prune -o -name \'message.*\' -exec grep -Iw uint {}Finally, note that if you omit any action (-exec is an action), say like so:find . -name \'.svn\' -prune -o -name \'message.*\'then the -print action is implied but will apply to the WHOLE expression, including the -name \'.svn\' -prune -o part and thus print all .svn directories as well as the \'message.*\' files, which is probably not what you want. Therefore you always should use an \'action\' in the right-hand side of the boolean expression when using -prune in this way. And when that action is printing you have to explicitly add it, like so:find . -name \'.svn\' -prune -o -name \'message.*\' -print
