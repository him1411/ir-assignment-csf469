I\'ve been working on a project, but unfortunately, I forgot to switch to my branch, and as such have been working on masterHow can I copy the work (3 files) I\'ve done here from master, to my branch (called, for example branch123) without comitting to master?Sounds like all you need is the following:Then you should be back on your own branch without touching the master branch.This is an old question but it\'s at the top of Google for "working on the wrong branch".  I think a better answer is to simply checkout the branch you wanted to be working on.  No need to stash anything:The default behavior of checkout is to NOT overwrite modified files in your working directory, so you won\'t lose anything.  Based on what I found here.Edit:\nThis method will only work if the files you have modified in the working directory are identical in both master and branch123.  This was actually pointed out by Jefromi in the comments to the accepted answer, but I didn\'t understand what he was saying the first time I read it.git stash is what you need.a full explanation can be found in Git-Tools-StashingAs it is possible to create a new branch but not possible to checkout an existing branch while having files checked out, I found the following trick using a temporary branch to work:This scenario works at least with VS 2015 Git plugin but would most likely work with any git tool.EDIT: I found out that you will have to perform a rebase (git rebase --onto) of the temp branch before performing the merge. Otherwise the changes in master will be included in the merge. An extra step 3.5 above. See further about rebase here: \nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing
