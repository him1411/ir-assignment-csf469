I cannot seem to find the JavaScriptSerializer object nor the the System.Web.Script.Serialization namespace within Visual Studio 2010.  I need to serialize something to JSON what am I supposed to use?And yes, I already included the System.Web.Extensions (in System.Web.Extensions.dll) within the project.  Which is why I am shocked?Check if you included the .net 4 version of System.Web.Extensions - there\'s a 3.5 version as well, but I don\'t think that one works.These steps work for me:From the first search result on google:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.script.serialization.javascriptserializer.aspxJavaScriptSerializer ClassProvides serialization and deserialization functionality for AJAX-enabled applications.Inheritance HierarchySystem.Object System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializerNamespace:  System.Web.Script.SerializationAssembly:  System.Web.Extensions (in System.Web.Extensions.dll)So, include System.Web.Extensions.dll as a reference.I\'m using Visual Studio 2015 and finally ran across this post.  Yes in order to use You must right click on references and under Assemblies --> Framework chooseThen add in your referenceThis is how to get JavaScriptSerializer available in your application, targetting .NET 4.0 (full)This should allow you to create a new JavaScriptSerializer object!For those who seem to be following the answers above but still have the problem (e.g., see the first comment on the poster\'s question):You are probably working in a solution with many projects.  The project you appear to be working in references other projects, but you are actually modifying a file from one of the other projects.  For example:But if the file you are modifying to use System.Web.Script.Serialization is in project B, then you will need to add a reference to System.Web.Extension in project B as well.Are you targeting the .NET 4 framework or the .NET 4 Client Profile?If you\'re targeting the latter, you won\'t find that class.  You also may be missing a reference, likely to an extensions dll.Did you include a reference to System.Web.Extensions?  If you click on your first link it says which assembly it\'s in.is in assembly :  System.Web.Extensions (System.Web.Extensions.dll)You have to add the reference to the project.In Assemblies, there is a System.Web.Extensions Add that.Once that is done put:That worked for me.Just so you know, I am using Visual Studio 2013 and have had the same problem until I used the Project Properties to switch to 3.5 framework and back to 4.5. This for some reason registered the .dll properly and I could use the System.Web.Extensions.you can use other option which is the NewtonsoftJASON, you can install it from NuGet Package Manager.Tools >> Nuget PacakgeManager
