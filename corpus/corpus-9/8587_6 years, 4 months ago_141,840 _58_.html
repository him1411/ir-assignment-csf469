I\'ve run into a couple of cases now where it would be convenient to be able to find the "topmost" view controller (the one responsible for the current view), but haven\'t found a way to do it.Basically the challenge is this: Given that one is executing in a class that is not a view controller (or a view) [and does not have the address of an active view] and has not been passed the address of the topmost view controller (or, say, the address of the navigation controller), is it possible to find that view controller?  (And, if so, how?)Or, failing that, is it possible to find the topmost view?iOS 4 introduced the rootViewController property on UIWindow:You\'ll need to set it yourself after you create the view controller though.I think you need a combination of the accepted answer and @fishstix\'sTo complete JonasG\'s answer (who left out tab bar controllers while traversing), here is my version of returning the currently visible view controller:To complete Eric\'s answer (who left out popovers, navigation controllers, tabbarcontrollers, view controllers added as subviews to some other view controllers while traversing), here is my version of returning the currently visible view controller:==========================================================================================================================================And now all you need to do to get top most view controller is call the above method as follows:Getting top most view controller for Swift using extensionsCode: Usage:This answer includes childViewControllers and maintains a clean and readable implementation.I recently got this situation in one my project, which required to displayed a notification view whatever the controller displayed was and whatever was the type (UINavigationController, classic controller or custom view controller), when network status changed.So I juste released my code, which is quite easy and actually based on a protocol so that it is flexible with every type of container controller.\nIt seems to be related with the last answers, but in a much flexible way.You can grab the code here : PPTopMostControllerAnd got the top most controller using A complete non-recursive version, taking care of different scenarios:Objective-CSwift 3.1 This is an improvement to Eric\'s answer:_topMostController(UIViewController *cont) is a helper function.Now all you need to do is call topMostController() and the top most UIViewController should be returned!Here is my take on this. Thanks to @Stakenborg for pointing out the way to skip getting UIAlertView as the top most controllerFor latest Swift Version:\nCreate a file, name it UIWindowExtension.swift and paste the following snippet:Use it anywhere as:Simple extension for UIApplication in Swift:NOTE:It cares about moreNavigationController within UITabBarControllerSimple usage:Here is what worked for me. I found that sometimes the controller was nil on the key window, as the keyWindow is some OS thing like an alert, etc. Expanding on @Eric\'s answer, you need to be careful that the keyWindow is actually the window you want. If you are trying to utilize this method after tapping something in an alert view for example, the keyWindow will actually be the alert\'s window, and that will cause problems for you no doubt. This happened to me in the wild when handling deep links via an alert and caused SIGABRTs with NO STACK TRACE. Total bitch to debug.Here\'s the code I\'m using now:Feel free to mix this with whatever flavor of retrieving the top view controller you like from the other answers on this question.Alternative Swift solution:Yet another Swift solutionThis solution is the most complete. It takes in consideration:\nUINavigationController\nUIPageViewController\nUITabBarController\nAnd the topmost presented view controller from the top view controllerThe example is in Swift 3.There are 3 overloadsGreat solution in Swift, implement in AppDelegateNot sure if this will help what you\'re trying to accomplish by finding the topmost view controller, but I was trying to present a new view controller, but if my root view controller already had a modal dialog, it would be blocked, so I would cycle to the top of all modal view controllers using this code:Swift:Usage:Below two function can help to find the topViewController on Stack of view controllers. You may need customization later, but for this code is awesome to understand the concept of topViewController or stack of viewControllers.You can use [viewController Class] method to find out the type of class of a viewController.And another Swift solutionIf the root controller is a navigation controller, correct way to find top visible controller is:Here\'s an excerpt from UINavigationController.h:This works great for finding the top viewController 1 from any root view controlleyou could find the top most view controller by usingAnother solution relies on the responder chain, which may or may not work depending on what the first responder is:Example pseudo code:To avoid a lot of complexity I keep track of the current viewController by  creating a viewController in the delegate and set it to self inside each viewDidLoad method, this way anytime you load a new view the ViewController held in the delegate will correspond to that view\'s viewController. This may be ugly, but it works wonderfully, and theres no need to have a navigation controller or any of that nonsense.Previous answer does not seems to handle cases where rootController are UITabBarController or UINavigationController.Here is the function in swift which works for those cases :
