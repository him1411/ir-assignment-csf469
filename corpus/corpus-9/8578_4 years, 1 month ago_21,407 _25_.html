Sometimes when I read articles in the Scala ecosystem I read the term "lifting" / "lifted". Unfortunately, it is not explained what that exactly means. I did some research, and it seems that lifting has something to do with functional values or something like that, but I was not able to find a text that explains what lifting actually is about in a beginner friendly way. There is additional confusion through the Lift framework which has lifting in its name, but it doesn\'t help answer the question.What is "lifting" in Scala?There are a few usages:Remember a PartialFunction[A, B] is a function defined for some subset of the domain A (as specified by the isDefinedAt method). You can "lift" a PartialFunction[A, B] into a Function[A, Option[B]]. That is, a function defined over the whole of A but whose values are of type Option[B]This is done by the explicit invocation of the method lift on PartialFunction.You can "lift" a method invocation into a function. This is called eta-expansion (thanks to Ben James for this). So for example:We lift a method into a function by applying the underscoreNote the fundamental difference between methods and functions. res0 is an instance (i.e. it is a value) of the (function) type (Int => Int)A functor (as defined by scalaz) is some "container" (I use the term extremely loosely), F such that, if we have an F[A] and a function A => B, then we can get our hands on an F[B] (think, for example, F = List and the map method)We can encode this property as follows:This is isomorphic to being able to "lift" the function A => B into the domain of the functor. That is:That is, if F is a functor, and we have a function A => B, we have a function F[A] => F[B]. You might try and implement the lift method - it\'s pretty trivial.As hcoopz says below (and I\'ve just realized that this would have saved me from writing a ton of unnecessary code), the term "lift" also has a meaning within Monad Transformers. Recall that a monad transformers are a way of "stacking" monads on top of each other (monads do not compose).So for example, suppose you have a function which returns an IO[Stream[A]]. This can be converted to the monad transformer StreamT[IO, A]. Now you may wish to "lift" some other value an IO[B] perhaps to that it is also a StreamT. You could either write this:Or this:this begs the question: why do I want to convert an IO[B] into a StreamT[IO, B]?. The answer would be "to take advantage of composition possibilities". Let\'s say you have a function f: (A, B) => CAnother usage of lifting that I\'ve come across in papers (not necessarily Scala-related ones) is overloading a function from f: A -> B with f: List[A] -> List[B] (or sets, multisets, ...). This is often used to simplify formalisations because it then doesn\'t matter whether f is applied to an individual element or to multiple elements.This kind of overloading is often done declaratively, e.g.,oror imperatively, e.g.,Note any collection that extends PartialFunction[Int, A] (as pointed out by oxbow_lakes) may be lifted; thus for instancewhich turns a partial function into a total function where values not defined in the collection are mapped onto None,Moreover,This shows a neat approach to avoid index out of bounds exceptions.
