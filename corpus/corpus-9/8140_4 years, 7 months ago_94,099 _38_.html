I have 10 markers in the GoogleMap. I want to zoom in as much as possible and keep all markers in view? In the earlier version this can be achieved from zoomToSpan() but in v2 I have no idea how about doing that. Further, I know the radius of the circle that needs to be visible.You should use the CameraUpdate class to do (probably) all programmatic map movements.To do this, first calculate the bounds of all the markers like so:Then obtain a movement description object by using the factory: CameraUpdateFactory:Finally move the map:Or if you want an animation:That\'s all :)Clarification 1Almost all movement methods require the Map object to have passed the layout process. You can wait for this to happen using the addOnGlobalLayoutListener construct. Details can be found in comments to this answer and remaining answers. You can also find a complete code for setting map extent using addOnGlobalLayoutListener here.Clarification 2One comment notes that using this method for only one marker results in map zoom set to a "bizarre" zoom level (which I believe to be maximum zoom level available for given location). I think this is expected because:Another way to put it: how can Map object know what zoom level should it choose for a single location? Maybe the optimal value should be 20 (if it represents a specific address). Or maybe 11 (if it represents a town). Or maybe 6 (if it represents a country). API isn\'t that smart and the decision is up to you.So, you should simply check if markers has only one location and if so, use one of:So I needed to use addOnGlobalLayoutListener to get the appropriate samplefor example, your Google Map is inside RelativeLayout:I couldnt use the onGlobalLayoutlistener, so here is another solution to prevent the\n"Map size can\'t be 0. Most likely, layout has not yet occured for the map view. Either wait until layout has occurred or use newLatLngBounds(LatLngBounds, int, int, int) which allows you to specify the map\'s dimensions." error:Working fine for me.From this code, I am displaying multiple markers with particular zoom on map screen. // Declared variables// Method for adding multiple marker points with drawable icon// For adding multiple markers visible on mapNote - This is not a solution to the original question. This is a solution to one of the subproblems discussed above.Solution to @andr Clarification 2 - Its really problematic when there\'s only one marker in the bounds and due to it the zoom level is set to a very high level (level 21). And Google does not provide any way to set the max zoom level at this point. This can also happen when there are more than 1 marker but they are all pretty close to each other. Then also the same problem will occur.Solution -  Suppose you want your Map to never go beyond 16 zoom level. Then after doing - Check if your zoom level has crossed level 16(or whatever you want) - And if this level is greater than 16, which it will only be if there are very less markers or all the markers are very close to each other, then simply zoom out your map at that particular position only by seting the zoom level to 16.This way you\'ll never have the problem of "bizarre" zoom level explained very well by @andr too.Use the method "getCenterCoordinate" to obtain the center coordinate and use in CameraPosition.this would help.. from google apis demosfor clear info look at this url.\nhttps://github.com/googlemaps/android-samples/blob/master/ApiDemos/app/src/main/java/com/example/mapdemo/MarkerDemoActivity.javaI had similar problem, using following code solved the issue:CameraUpdateFactory.newLatLngBounds(bounds, 200, 200, 5) generally the location differences in my case are no more than two neighbour cities.zoom to fit all markers on map google maps v2http://i64.tinypic.com/2qjybh4.pnghttp://i63.tinypic.com/flzwus.pnghttp://i63.tinypic.com/112g5fm.png
