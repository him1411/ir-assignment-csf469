I\'m trying out the new version 2.0 of AFNetworking and I\'m getting the error above. Any idea why this is happening? Here\'s my code:Any ideas will be appreciated. I\'m also using Xcode 5.0 if that helps. Thanks!Also, here\'s the error message:I just hid the JSON using kJSONlink. This should return a JSON.This means that your server is sending "text/html" instead of the already supported types.\nMy solution was to add "text/html" to acceptableContentTypes set in AFURLResponseSerialization class. Just search for "acceptableContentTypes" and add @"text/html" to the set manually.Of course, the ideal solution is to change the type sent from the server, but for that you will have to talk with the server team.Setting my RequestOperationManager Response Serializer to HTTPResponseSerializer fixed the issue.Objective-CSwiftMaking this change means I don\'t need to add acceptableContentTypes to every request I make.I took @jaytrixz\'s answer/comment one step further and added "text/html" to the existing set of types.  That way when they fix it on the server side to "application/json" or "text/json" I claim it\'ll work seamlessly.On the server side, I added: into my .php code and this also fixed the problem.I solve this problem from a different perspective. I think if the server sends JSON data with Content-Type: text/html header. It doesn\'t mean the server guy intended to send you some html but accidentally changed to JSON. It does mean the server guy just doesn\'t care about what the Content-Type header is. So if the server guy doesn\'t care as the client side you better ignore the Content-Type header as well. To ignore the Content-Type header check in AFNetworking In this way the AFJSONResponseSerializer (the default one) will serialize the JSON data without checking Content-Type in response header.A simple way to enable to receive "text/plain" content type:Similarly if you wish to enable "text/html" content type:I tried below line as per @Andrie answer but didn\'t work, so after hunting more, I did work around to get it work successfully.Here is my code snip.Hope this will help someone out there.This is the only thing that I found to workIf someone is using AFHTTPSessionManager then one can do like this to solve the issue,I subclassed AFHTTPSessionManager where I\'m doing like this,Just add this line :In my case, I don\'t have control over server setting, but I know it\'s expecting "application/json" for "Content-Type". I did this on the iOS client side:refer to\nAFNetworking version 2 content-type errorI had a somehow similar problem working with AFNetworking from a Swift codebase so I\'m just leaving this here in the remote case someone is as unlucky as me having to work in such a setup. If you are, I feel you buddy, stay strong!The operation was failing due to "unacceptable content-type", despite me actually setting the acceptableContentTypes with a Set containing the content type value in question.The solution for me was to tweak the Swift code to be more Objective-C friendly, I guess:A good question always have multiple answers, to reduce and help you choose the right answer, here I am adding my own too. I have tested it and it works fine.
