I am new to MySQL. I want to execute a text file containing SQL queries.I tried to run source /Desktop/test.sql and received the error,If you\xe2\x80\x99re at the MySQL command line mysql> you have to declare the SQL file as source.You have quite a lot of options:you can execute mysql statements that have been written in a text file using the following command:if yourdatabase has not been created yet, log into your mysql first using:then:then:that should do it!More info here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-batch-commands.htmlAll the top answers are good. But just in case someone wants to run the query from a text file on a remote server AND save results to a file (instead of showing on console), you can do this:Hope this helps someone.My favorite option to do that will be:I use it this way because when you string it with "" you avoiding wrong path and mistakes with spaces and - and probably more problems with chars that I did not encounter with.Do not specify single quotes.If the above command is not working, copy the file to c: drive and try again.\nas shown below,Give the path of .sql file as:use the following from mysql command prompt-Use no quotation. Even if the path contains space(\' \') use no quotation at all.Very likely, you just need to change the slash/blackslash:\nfromtoSo the command would be:Never is a good practice to pass the password argument directly from the command line, it is saved in the ~/.bash_history file and can be accessible from other applications.Use this instead:Since mysql -u yourusername -p yourpassword yourdatabase < text_file did not work on a remote server (Amazon\'s EC2)...Make sure that the Database is created first.Then:For future reference, I\'ve found this to work vs the aforementioned methods, under Windows in your msql console:mysql>>source c://path_to_file//path_to_file//file_name.sql;If your root drive isn\'t called "c" then just interchange with what your drive is called. First try backslashes, if they dont work, try the forward slash. If they also don\'t work, ensure you have your full file path, the .sql extension on the file name, and if your version insists on semi-colons, ensure it\'s there and try again.I had this error, and tried all the advice i could get to no avail.Finally, the problem was that my folder had a space in the folder name which appearing as a forward-slash in the folder path, once i found and removed it, it worked fine.I came here searching for this answer as well, and here is what I found works the best for me: Note I am using Ubuntu 16.x.xHope this helps.mysql -uusername -ppassword database-name < file.sqlYou can use SQLyog\'s Execute SQL script to execute the .sql file. Select the file and press Execute. :-) You get 30 day free trial. And, you are getting the error because you have quotes around the file name.The file must be located on the client host where you\'re running mysql. The filename must either be an absolute pathname listing the full name of the file, or a pathname that\'s specified relative to the directory in which you invoked mysql. For example, if you started mysql on a Windows machine in the C:\\mysql directory and your script file is my_commands.sql in the C:\\scripts directory, both of the following SOURCE commands tell mysql to execute the SQL statements in the file:mysql> SOURCE C:\\scripts\\my_commands.sql;mysql> SOURCE ..\\scripts\\my_commands.sql;The other way to execute a script file is by naming it on the mysql command line. Invoke mysql and use the < input redirection operator to specify the file from which to read query input:shell> mysql db_name < input_file
