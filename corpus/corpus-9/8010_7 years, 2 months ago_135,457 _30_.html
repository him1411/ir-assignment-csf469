What do the $@ and $< do exactly?$@ is the name of the file being generated, and $< the first prerequisite (usually the source file). You can find a list of all these special variables in the GNU Make manual.For example, consider the following declaration:In this case:The $@ and $< are called the automatic variables. The $@ is the output variable. $< is called the first input variable. For example:Here, hello.o is the output file. This is what $@ exapnds to. The first dependency is hello.c. That\'s what $< expands to.The -c flag generates the .o file; see man gcc for a more detailed explanation. The -o specifies the file to output to.For further details, you can read this.Also, you can check the GNU manuals. There is a way to debug your makefile to understand it better.This will output the makefile database:The $@ and $< are special macros.Where:$@ is the file name of the target.$< is the name of the first dependency.From Managing Projects with GNU Make, 3rd Edition (it\'s under GNU Free Documentation License):Automatic variables are set by make after a rule is matched. They\n  provide access to elements from the target and prerequisite lists so\n  you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to explicitly specify any filenames. They are very\n  useful for avoiding code duplication, but are critical when defining\n  more general pattern rules.There are seven \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d automatic variables:$@: The filename representing the target.$%: The filename element of an archive member specification.$<: The filename of the first prerequisite.$?: The names of all prerequisites that are newer than the target,\n  separated by spaces.$^: The filenames of all the prerequisites, separated by spaces. This\n  list has duplicate filenames removed since for most uses, such as\n  compiling, copying, etc., duplicates are not wanted.$+: Similar to $^, this is the names of all the prerequisites separated\n  by spaces, except that $+ includes duplicates. This variable was\n  created for specific situations such as arguments to linkers where\n  duplicate values have meaning.$*: The stem of the target filename. A stem is typically a filename\n  without its suffix. Its use outside of pattern rules is\n  discouraged.In addition, each of the above variables has two variants for\n  compatibility with other makes. One variant returns only the directory\n  portion of the value. This is indicated by appending a \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d to the\n  symbol, $(@D), $(<D), etc. The other variant returns only the file\n  portion of the value. This is indicated by appending an \xe2\x80\x9cF\xe2\x80\x9d to the\n  symbol, $(@F), $(<F), etc. Note that these variant names are more than\n  one character long and so must be enclosed in parentheses. GNU make\n  provides a more readable alternative with the dir and notdir\n  functions.The Makefile builds the hello executable if any one of main.cpp, hello.cpp, factorial.cpp changed. The smallest possible Makefile to achieve that specification could have been:To improve on the above, we only compile those C++ files that were edited. Then, we just link the resultant object files together.To improve on this, we can replace all object file rules with a single .cpp.o rule:Here the .cpp.o rule defines how to build anyfile.o from anyfile.cpp.The other changes present in the Makefile are:
