So, one can attempt to fetch the following JSON object:Is there a way to produce exactly the same body in a response from a server using node or express? Clearly, one can set the headers and indicate that the content-type of the response is going to be "application/json", but then there are different ways to write/send the object. The one that I have seen commonly being used is by using a command of the form:However, this has two points where one could argue as if they were "problems":Another idea is to use the command:This appears to be sending a JSON object based on the output of curl similar to the first example above. However, there is no new line character in the end of the body when curl is again being used on a terminal. So, how can one actually write down something like this with a new line character appended in the end using node or node/express?That response is a string too, if you want to send the response prettified, for some awkward reason, you could use something like JSON.stringify(anObject, null, 3)It\'s important that you set the Content-Type header to application/json, too.Prettified:I\'m not exactly sure why you want to terminate it with a newline, but you could just do JSON.stringify(...) + \'\\n\' to achieve that.In express you can do this by changing the options instead.\'json replacer\' JSON replacer callback, null by default\'json spaces\' JSON response spaces for formatting, defaults to 2 in development, 0 in productionNot actually recommended to set to 40Then you could just respond with some json.It\'ll use the \'json spaces\' configuration to prettify it.Since Express.js 3x the response object has a json() method which sets all the headers correctly for you and returns the response in JSON format.Example:If you are trying to send a json file you can use streamsYou can just prettify it using pipe and one of many processor. Your app should always response with as small load as possible.https://github.com/ddopson/underscore-cli
