My problem goes something like this:A client receives an email sent by Exchange Server.\nIn the mail he has a formatted body with HTML with a couple of links that haveMy question is: can i insert HTML formatted body in the mailto: part of the href?something like<a href=\'mailto:me@me.com?subject=Me&body=<b>ME</b>\'>Mail me</a>?Note that (2016) in iOS, it is perfectly fine to add <i> and <b> tags for simple italic, bold formatting.As you can see in RFC 6068, this is not possible at all:The special <hfname> "body" indicates that the associated <hfvalue>\n  is the body of the message.  The "body" field value is intended to\n  contain the content for the first text/plain body part of the\n  message.  The "body" pseudo header field is primarily intended for\n  the generation of short text messages for automatic processing (such\n  as "subscribe" messages for mailing lists), not for general MIME\n  bodies.No. This is not possible at all.Whilst it is NOT possible to use HTML to format your email body you can add line breaks as has been previously suggested.If you are able to use javascript then "encodeURIComponent()" might be of use like below...I have used this and it seems to work with outlook, not using html but you can format the text with line breaks at least when the body is added as output.Some things are possible, but not all, say for example you want line breaks, instead of using <br />use %0D%0AExample: It is worth pointing out that on Safari on the iPhone, at least, inserting basic HTML tags such as <b>, <i>, and <img> (which ideally you shouldn\'t use in other circumstances anymore anyway, preferring CSS) into the body parameter in the mailto: does appear to work - they are honored within the email client. I haven\'t done exhaustive testing to see if this is supported by other mobile or desktop browser/email client combos. It\'s also dubious whether this is really standards-compliant. Might be useful if you are building for that platform, though.As other responses have noted, you should also use encodeURIComponent on the entire body before embedding it in the mailto: link.It is possible to enter unicode values to insert newlines (ie: \'\\u0009\') but HTML tags have varying degrees of support and should be avoided.I have worked this way:Output would be:Here\'s how you add everything to a MAILTO link: Each component is separated by the ampersand (&) sign. Only the first component after the initial email address has a question mark (?) preceding the ampersand. URL-encode is the key!  So for your example of a body, instead of your...you might try:Here\'s another route you might try.  Create a javascript function to open an ActiveX object.  This has the unfortunate limitation of only working in IE and Outlook, and may cause your page to show activex warnings.  But if you can live with these caveats, it does the job.  Here\'s a working sample you can draw from:
