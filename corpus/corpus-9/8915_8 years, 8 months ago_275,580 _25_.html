Is there a way that I can get the last value (based on the \'\\\' symbol) from a full path?Example:C:\\Documents and Settings\\img\\recycled log.jpgWith this case, I just want to get recycled log.jpg from the full path in JavaScript.This will handle both \\ OR / in pathsWhat platform does the path come from? Windows paths are different from POSIX paths are different from Mac OS 9 paths are different from RISC OS paths are different...If it\'s a web app where the filename can come from different platforms there is no one solution. However a reasonable stab is to use both \'\\\' (Windows) and \'/\' (Linux/Unix/Mac and also an alternative on Windows) as path separators. Here\'s a non-RegExp version for extra fun:Just for the sake of performance, I tested all the answers given here:And the winner is the Split and Pop style answer, Thanks to bobince !Ates, your solution doesn\'t protect against an empty string as input.  In that case, it fails with TypeError: /([^(\\\\|\\/|\\:)]+)$/.exec(fullPath) has no properties.bobince, here\'s a version of nickf\'s that handles DOS, POSIX, and HFS path delimiters (and empty strings):In Node.js, you can use Path\'s parse module...The following line of JavaScript code will give you the file name.Not more concise than nickf\'s answer, but this one directly "extracts" the answer instead of replacing unwanted parts with an empty string:A question asking "get file name without extension" refer to here but no solution for that.\nHere is the solution modified from Bobbie\'s solution.The complete answer is:Successfully Script for your question ,Full TestI use:  It replaces the last \\ so it also works with folders.var file_name = file_path.substring(file_path.lastIndexOf(\'/\'));var fileName = filePath.split(\'/\').pop();It works for me.refer from \nhttp://www.codeprojectdownload.com
