I can\'t seem to get any search results that explain how to do this.All I want to do is be able to know if a given path is a file or a directory (folder).fs.lstatSync(path_string).isDirectory() should tell you.  From the docs:Objects returned from fs.stat() and fs.lstat() are of this type.Here\'s how you would detect if a path is a file or a directory asynchronously, which is the recommended approach in node.\n using fs.lstatNote when using the synchronous API:When using the synchronous form any exceptions are immediately thrown.\n  You can use try/catch to handle exceptions or allow them to bubble up.
