When an EditText is in password mode, it seems that the hint is shown in a different font (courrier?). How can I avoid this? I would like the hint to appear in the same font that when the EditText is not in password mode.My current xml:Changing the typeface in xml didn\'t work on the hint text for me either.  I found two different solutions, the second of which has better behavior for me:1) Remove android:inputType="textPassword" from your xml file and instead, in set it in java:With this approach, the hint font looks good but as you\'re typing in that edit field, you don\'t see each character in plain text before it turns into a password dot. Also when making input in fullscreen, the dots will not appear, but the passoword in clear text.2) Leave android:inputType="textPassword" in your xml.  In Java, ALSO set the typeface and passwordMethod:This approach gave me the hint font I wanted AND gives me the behavior I want with the password dots.Hope that helps!I found this useful tip from Dialogs GuideTip: By default, when you set an EditText element to use the "textPassword" input type, the font family is set to monospace, so you should change its font family to "sans-serif" so that both text fields use a matching font style.For exampleThis is what I did to fix this problem.  For some reason I didn\'t have to set the transformation method so this may be a better solution:In my xml:In my Activity:The setTransformationMethod approach breaks android:imeOption for me, and allows carriage returns to be typed into the password field. Instead I\'m doing this:And am not setting android:password="true" in XML. The answer manisha provided does work, but it leaves the password field in a nonstandard state compared to the default.  That is, the default fontface then applies also to the password field, including both the dot replacements and the preview characters that appears before being replaced with the dots (as well as when it is a "visible password" field).To fix this and make it 1) look and act exactly like the default textPassword input type, but also 2) allow the hint text to appear in a default (non-monospace) font, you need to have a TextWatcher on the field that can toggle the fontface properly back and forth between Typeface.DEFAULT and Typeface.MONOSPACE based on whether it is empty or not.  I created a helper class that can be used to accomplish that:Then to make use of it, all you need to do is call the register(View) static method.  Everything else is automatic (including skipping the workaround if the view does not require it!):You can also use a custom Widget. It\'s very simple and it doesn\'t clutter your Activity/Fragment code.Here\'s the code:And your XML will look like this:The other answers are the right solution for most cases.However, if you\'re using a custom EditText subclass to, say, apply a custom font by default, there\'s a subtle issue. If you set the custom font in the constructor of your subclass, it will still be overwritten by the system if you set inputType="textPassword".In this case, move your styling to onAttachedToWindow after your super.onAttachedToWindow call.Example implementation:use the calligraphy library. then it still wont update the password fields with the right font. so do this in code not in xml:I recently added the ability to change toggle monospace on/off to a extension of EditText specifically for passwords it may help some people. It doesn\'t use android:fontFamily so is compatible <16. You can also use the together withI use this solution to toggle the Typeface depending on hint visibility. It\'s similar to Joe\'s answer, but extending EditText instead:In case you are using the calligraphy library in combination with a TextInputLayout and an EditText, the following code works well.A weird case perhaps, but I have experimented with this and found out that:changed the size of the font of the hint instead of the font itself! This is still an undesired effect. Strangely enough, the reverse operation:Keeps the same font size.This how to make input password that has hint which not converted to * and default typeface !!.On XML : On Activity : thanks to : mango and rjrjr for the insight :D.like the above but make sure the fields do not have the bold style in xml as they will never look the same even with the above fix!
