Is it possible to do a select statement that takes only NOT NULL values?Right now I am using this:And then I have to filter out the null values with a php loop.Is there a way to do:?Right now when I select * I get val1,val2,val3,null,val4,val5,null,null etc.... but I just want to get the values that are not null in my result. Is this possible without filtering with a loop?You should use IS NOT NULL. (The comparison operators = and <> both give UNKNOWN with NULL on either side of the expression.)Just for completeness I\'ll mention that in MySQL you can also negate the null safe equality operator but this is not standard SQL.Edited to reflect comments. It sounds like your table may not be in first normal form in which case changing the structure may make your task easier. A couple of other ways of doing it though...The disadvantage of the above is that it scans the table multiple times once for each column. That may possibly be avoided by the below but I haven\'t tested this in MySQL.You can filter out rows that contain a NULL value in a specific column:If you want to filter out rows that contain a null in any column then try this:Update: Based on your comments, perhaps you want this?And I agre with Martin that if you need to do this then you should probably change your database design.The only disadvantage of this approach is that you can only compare 5 columns, after that the result will always be false, so I do compare only the fields that can be NULL.I found this solution:This query select last not null value for each column.ExampleIf you have a table:you get:QueryI hope help you.I use the \\! command within MySQL to grep out NULL values from the shell:It works best with a proper .my.cnf where your database/username/password are specified. That way you just have to surround your select with \\! mysql e and | grep -v NULL.Yes use NOT NULL in your query like this below.
