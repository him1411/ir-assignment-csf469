I am trying to return some JSON from a WCF service.  This service simply returns some content from my database. I can get the data. However, I am concerned about the format of my JSON. Currently, the JSON that gets returned is formatted like this:In reality, I would like my JSON to be formatted as cleanly as possible. I believe (I may be incorrect), that the same collection of results, represented in clean JSON, should look like so:I have no idea where the \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x9d is coming from. I also have no clue why the escape characters are being inserted. My entity looks like the following:The service that is responsible for returning the content is defined as:How do I return \xe2\x80\x9cclean\xe2\x80\x9d JSON from a WCF service?\nThank you!Change the return type of your GetResults to be List<Person>.\nEliminate the code that you use to serialize the List to a json string - WCF does this for you automatically. Using your definition for the Person class, this code works for me: results:(All on one line)I also used this attribute on the method: WebInvoke with Method= "GET" is the same as WebGet, but since some of my methods are POST, I use all WebInvoke for consistency.  The UriTemplate sets the URL at which the method is available.  So I can do a GET on \nhttp://myserver/myvdir/JsonService.svc/players and it just works. Also check out IIRF or another URL rewriter to get rid of the .svc in the URI. If you want nice json without hardcoding attributes into your service classes,use <webHttp defaultOutgoingResponseFormat="Json"/> in your behavior configThis is accomplished in web.config for your webservice. Set the bindingBehavior to <webHttp> and you will see the clean JSON. The extra "[d]" is set by the default behavior which you need to overwrite.See in addition this blogpost:\nhttp://blog.clauskonrad.net/2010/11/how-to-expose-json-endpoint-from-wcf.htmlI faced the same problem, and resolved it by changing the BodyStyle attribut value to "WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare" : The returned object will no longer be wrapped.When you are using GET Method\nthe contract must be this.with this we have a json without the boot parameterAldo Flores\n@alduar\nhttp://alduar.blogspot.comIn your IServece.cs add the following tag : BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.Bare
