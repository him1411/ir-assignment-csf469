Recently our svn server was changed and we did a svn switch.Since the working copy had a huge amount of unversioned resources, the working copy got locked and we started switching folder by folder for all folders under svn, which works perfectly fine.But at the top most level of the repository, when I try to update files, I get the svn: Working copy \'.\' locked error and cleanup is not helping either. When I do cleanup, I get errors like these - svn: \'content\' is not a working copy directoryFresh checkout is NOT an option at all. Are there any other ways to cleanup and release the locks and do the switch completely ?EDIT: \nThe last paragraph in JesperE\'s answerIf you get a "not a working copy" when\n  doing a recursive "svn cleanup" my\n  guess is that you have a directory\n  which should be a working copy (i.e.\n  the .svn directory at the toplevel\n  says so), but it is missing its own\n  .svn directory. In that case, you\n  could try to just remove/move that\n  directory and then do a local updateseems to be the solution to the problem in the repository. I have identified those folders and did a fresh checkout of those specific folders alone and wow, the locks are released in the subsequent cleanup! Thanks a lot JesperE !!But, I still cannot figure out the svn switch error which now reads something like,svn: The repository at\n  \'svn://repourl/reponame/foldername\'\n  has uuid \'m/reponame\', but the WC\n  has \'b5b39681-0ff6-784b-ad26-2846b9ea8e7d\'Any ideas ?If you get a "not a working copy" when doing a recursive svn cleanup my guess is that you have a directory which should be a working copy (i.e. the .svn directory at the top level says so), but it is missing its own .svn directory. In that case, you could try to just remove/move that directory and then do a local update (i.e. rm -rf content; svn checkout content).If you get a not a working copy error, it means that Subversion cannot find a proper .svn directory in there. Check to see if there is an .svn directory in contentsThe ideal solution is a fresh checkout, if possible.I got into a similar situation (svn: \'papers\' is not a working copy directory) a different way, so I thought I\'d post my battle story (simplified):Oops! fix permissions... then:And even moving papers out of the way and running svn up (which worked for the OP) didn\'t fix it. Here\'s what I did:That worked.I solved it byIn my case the problem was due to deleted .svn-files. Maybe you just copied tree of folder and trying to add lowest one.in that case you have to commit directory on the upper level.Workaround:\nRename directory which is not \'working copy\'\nCheckout/update/restore this directory again\nMove files from renamed directory to new\nCommit changesReason:\nYou made some changes to some files under .svn directory, this breaks \'working copy\'I just got "not a working copy", and for me the reason was the Automouter on Unix.\nJust a fresh "cd /path/to/work/directory" did the trick.If you created a file inside a new directory, instead of \'svn add newdir/newfile\' use \'svn add newdir\' because you need to add the directory.  All the files inside the directory will be added by default.Same, I needed to update a \'contrib\' folder:I my case too the problem was due to deleted .svn folders.Solved.I tried pasting the .svn folder from the sub folder to the root folder. It works!!!This is what I did:I also meet this problem in svn diff operation, it was caused by incorrect file path, you should add \'./\' to indicate the current file directory.svn: The repository at \'svn://repourl/reponame/foldername\' has uuid \'m/reponame\', but the WC has \'b5b39681-0ff6-784b-ad26-2846b9ea8e7d\'Every subversion repo has a unique identifier (uuid). Subversion uses this to make sure that the repo is actually the same when doing things like switching. You should probably change the uuid on the server to be the same as before.Could it be a working copy format mismatch? It changed between svn 1.4 and 1.5 and newer tools automatically convert the format, but then the older ones no longer work with the converted copy.You must have deleted a SVN - base file from your project (which are read-only files). Due to this you get this error.Check out a fresh project again, merge the changes (if any) of your older SVN project with new one using "Winmerge" and commit the changes in your latest check out.@JesperE mentions that you need to change the uuid.  The following should help you achieve this.  On SVN 1.5+, you can do svnadmin setuuid; you can then check that it\'s been set correctly using svnlook uuid. On earlier versions of SVN, it\'s a harder process. See http://chestofbooks.com/computers/revision-control/subversion-svn/Managing-Repository-UUIDs-Reposadmin-Maint-Uuids.htmlAdditionally the UUID of "m/reponame" looks suspicious. I believe it should be a hex-formatted number like the working copy\'s, so maybe this action will improve things all round :-)[I originally commented on @JesperE\'s answer, but created this answer to make it more obvious to people and more helpful for Google.  I\'ve since removed my comments.  ]Had this same problem, turns out we had Slik 1.6.2 as well as Tortoise on the same machine. Tortoise had been updated (and had updated the working copy) but Slik had not, so Tortoise worked OK, but command lines failed with:svn: \'.\' is not a working copy directoryRemoving both Tortoise and Slik, then reinstalling Tortoise with command line tools enabled fixed this for me.for mac :- take checkout from server side and a new window will open to select directory from your local machine than put your all code in selected folder then open svn local side and add and commit the project Today i have found same issue /FILE_NAME/ is not a working copy in morning and i have spent more then two hours to solve it. After long of RND and Google i found some solution and that is CHECKOUT.Hope it will helpful for you.Delete .svn folder that is present in your local machine. Press windows icon and type .svn, delete the entire folder. It worked for me.
