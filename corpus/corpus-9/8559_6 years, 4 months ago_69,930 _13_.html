I know git stores information of when files get deleted and I am able to check individual commits to see which files have been removed but is there a command that would generate a list of every deleted file across a repository\'s lifespan?See Find and restore a deleted file in a Git repositoryIf you don\'t want all the information about which commit they were removed in, you can just add a grep delete in there.This does what you want, I think:... which I\'ve just taken more-or-less directly from this other answer.If you\'re only interested in seeing the currently deleted files, you can use this:if you then want to remove them (in case you deleted them not using "git rm") pipe that result to xargs git rmCiting this stackoverflow answer.\nPretty neat way to get type-of-change (A:Added, M:Modified, D:Deleted) for each file that got changed.And if you want to somehow constrain the results here\'s a nice one:You\'ll get all files deleted from some_dir (see the sed command) together with the commit number in which it happen. Any sed regex will do (I use this to find deleted file types, etc)Since Windows doesn\'t have a grep command, this worked for me in PowerShell:This will get you a list of all files that were deleted in all branches, sorted by their path:Works in msysgit (2.6.1.windows.1). Note we need "delete mode 100" as git files may have been commited as mode 100644 or 100755.
