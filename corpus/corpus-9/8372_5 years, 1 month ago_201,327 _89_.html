I see this only in Chrome.The full error message reads:"org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Element is not clickable at point (411, 675). Other element would receive the click: ..."The element that \'would receive the click\' is to the side of the element in question, not on top of it and not overlapping it, not moving around the page.I have tried adding an offset, but that does not work either.  The item is on the displayed window without any need for scrolling.This is caused by following 3 types:1.The element is not visible to click.Use Actions or JavascriptExecutor for making it to click.By Actions:By JavascriptExecutor:orThen click on the element.2.The page is getting refreshed before it is clicking the element.For this, make the page to wait for few seconds.3. The element is clickable but there is a spinner/overlay on top of itThe below code will wait until the overlay disppearsThen click on the element.There seems to be a bug in chromedriver for that (the problem is that it\'s marked as won\'t fix)\n--> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2766(place a bounty on FreedomSponsors perhaps?)There\'s a workaround suggested at comment #27.\nMaybe it\'ll work for you.You can also use JavaScript click and scrolling would be not required then.I had the same issue, tried all offered solutions but they did not work for me.\neventually I used this:Hope this helpsI have seen this in the situation when the selenium driven Chrome window was opened too small. The element to be clicked on was out of the viewport and therefore it was failing.That sounds logical... real user would have to either resize the window or scroll so that it is possible to see the element and in fact click on it.After instructing the selenium driver to set the window size appropriately this issues went away for me. The webdriver API is decribed here.Was getting this error when running tests headless with xvfb-run. They were working flawlessly locally. Using chrome, versions of webdriver / chromedriver / chrome / java etc all identical.The \xe2\x80\x98won\xe2\x80\x99t fix\xe2\x80\x99 bug in chromedriver - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2766 pointed out by Tony L\xc3\xa2mpada suggested this may be related to what is / isn\'t visible on the screen.Help message for xvfb-run shows the following:Changing the resolution for xvfb made the error go away:ruby/watir-webdriver/chromeI use the following trick and seems like it works:I, too, wrestled with this problem. Code works fine in FF, fails on Chrome. What I was trying to do was to click a tickbox - if it wasn\'t in view, I\'d scroll to view and then click. Even scrolling into view works in Chrome, only the bottom few pixels of the tickbox wasn\'t visible so webdriver refused to click on it. My workaround is this:Chrome also has issues with sendKeys, using Actions is sometimes necessary. Obviously, you need to know which direction and how much you need to go so your mileage may vary. But I prefer this to the javascript hack, so I\'m posting it here in case someone else will find it useful.Wow, a lot of answers here, and many good ones.I hope I\'ll add something to this from my experience.Well guys, in my case there was a cookie overlay hiding the element occasionally.\nScrolling to the element also works; but in my humble opinion (for my case, not a panacea for everyone) the simplest solution is just to go full screen (I was running my scripts on a 3/4 of the screen window)! So here we go:Hope that helps!I was facing a similar problem whre i have to check two check boxes one after the other.But i was getting the same above error.hence i added wait in between my steps for checking the checkboxes....its working fine and great.here are the steps:-First, try to get the latest Chrome driver and check if it solves the issue. In my case, it didn\'t fix the issue. But, the following solution worked for me so far. The following is C# code but you can follow same logic in your specific language. What we do here is, Step 1: Focus on the element using the Selenium Actions object,Step 2: Then do a click on the elementStep 3: If there\'s an exception, then we trigger a javascript "Click" event on the element by executing the javascript script through the Selenium browser driver\'s "ExecuteScript" method. You can also skip step 1 and 2 and try only step 3 too. Step 3 would work on it\'s own but I noticed some strange behavior in one scenario in which step 3, even though it successfully clicked the element, caused unexpected behavior in other parts of my code after clicking the element.I made this method based on a comment from Tony L\xc3\xa2mpada\'s answer. It works very well.   When using Protractor this helped me:I was facing the same problem with clj-webdriver  (clojure port of Selenium). I just translated the previous solution to clojure for convenience. You can call this function before doing click or whatever to avoid that problem.This might happen if the element changes position while the driver is attempting to click it (I\'ve seen this with IE too). The driver retains the initial position but by the time it actually gets to clicking on it, that position is no longer pointing to that element. The FireFox driver doesn\'t have this problem BTW, apparently it "clicks" elements programmatically.Anyway, this can happen when you use animations or simply change the height of elements dynamically (e.g. $("#foo").height(500)). You need to make sure that you only click elements after their height has "settled". I ended up with code that looks like this (C# bindings):In case of an animation or any other factor you can\'t easily query for, you can utilize a "generic" method that waits for the element to be stationary:I ran into this problem and it seems to be caused (in my case) by clicking an element that pops a div in front of the clicked element.  I got around this by wrapping my click in a big \'ol try catch block.  Maybe it\'s not really clean solution but it works:I was getting this bug because I tested a hover and then needed to click on the link underneath the tooltip. The solution was to add page.find(\'.sp-logo\').hover before click_link to get the tooltip out of the way.After testing all mentioned suggestions, nothing worked. I made this code. It works, but is not beautifulI met this because a loading dialog cover on this element. I simplely solve it by add a waiting before working with the this element. Hope this help!Explanation of error message:The error message simply says, that the element you want to click on is present, but it is not visible. It could be covered by something or temporary not visible.There could be many reasons why the element is not visible in the moment of the test. Please re-analyse your page and find proper solution for your case.Solution for particular case:In my case, this error occures, when a tooltip of the screen element i just clicked on, was poping over the element I wanted to click next. Defocus was a solution I needed.Apparently this is the result of a "Won\'t Fix" bug in the Chrome driver binary.One solution that worked for me (Our Mileage May Vary) can be found in this Google Group discussion, Comment #3:https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/selenium-developer-activity/DsZ5wFN52tcThe relevant portion is right here:I\'ve since worked around the issue by navigating directly to the href of\n  the parent anchor of the span.driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(driver.FindElement(By.Id(embeddedSpanIdToClick)).FindElement(By.XPath("..")).GetAttribute("href"));In my case, I\'m using Python, so once I got the desired element, I simply usedI would expect this to only work, however, if the element you are trying to click on is a link...I had the same problem and it was caused by an id conflict between the div and the link inside the div. So driver was clicking on the div instead of the link that I wanted.\nI changed the div id and it worked properly.Before:After:In Drupal when using Selenium:I had the same issue and got the \'other element would receive the click\' error for a displayed, visible element. I found no other solution that to trigger the click with a javascript.I replaced:with:and it all worked out fineRe Tony L\xc3\xa2mpada\'s answer, comment #27 did indeed solve the problem for me, except that it provided Java code and I needed Python. Here\'s a Python function that scrolls to the element\'s position and then clicks it.This solved the problem for me in Chrome 34.0. It caused no harm in Firefox 28.0 and IE 11; those browsers aren\'t subject to the problem, but scrolling to the element\'s position before clicking it still isn\'t a bad thing.I had the same problem and spent hours in finding the solution. I tried to click a cell at the bottom of a long ngGrid using protractor. Here is a snapshot of my ngGrid html:all clicking function did not work. The solution is to use evaluate in the element\'s current scope:I had another bug where find_link on Chrome and Poltergeist could not click an A tag with an EM tag and some text inside of it, although it worked fine in Firefox and rack_test. The solution was to replace click_link(link) with:In Visual Studio 2013, if you enable BrowserLink - it displays a BrowserLink navbar at the bottom of the screen. If the item you want to click is behind that navbar, it give the error. Disabling BrowserLink solved the problem for me.It\'s funny, all the time I spent looking at the various responses, no one had tried the obvious, which of course, I hadn\'t either. If your page has the same id used multiple times, as mine did, ("newButton",) and the one you want is not the first one found, then you will in all likelihood get this error. The easiest thing to do (C#):Note it\'s FindElements, not FindElement.And then test to see how many results came back from the retrieval. If it\'s the second one, you can then use:Or get whomever reused ids to fix them.
