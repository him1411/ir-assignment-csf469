Is there any way I can doin one command? I seem to be doing those two commands a lot, and if Git had an option like git commit -Am "commit message", it would make life that much more convenient.git commit has the -a modifier, but it doesn\'t quite do the same as doing git add -A before committing. git add -A adds newly created files, but git commit -am does not. What does?You can use git aliases, e.g.and use it with is an easy way to tell git to delete files you have deleted, but I generally don\'t recommend such catch-all workflows. git commits should in best practice be fairly atomic and only affect a few files.is an easy way to add all files new or modified. also, the catch-all qualification above applies. will not delete files deleted without the git rm command.is an easy way to add all files to the index from a single dir, in this case the app dir.To keep it in one line use:This line will add and commit all changed and added files to repository.Just combine your commands: In the later version of git you can add and commit like this Additionally you an alias:Then you can use it like this:On my windows machine I have set up this .bashrc alias to make the entire process more simple.add the following line to fileit does git add commit and push . tweak it in any manner, say you don\'t want the push command remove that partreload .bashrc / close and reopen your shellI do a shellsave for example git.sh and later call:If you type:once, you will just need to type every time:I use the following (both are work in progress, so I\'ll try to remember to update this):With the echo "Enter commit message:" && read MSG part inspired by Sojan V JoseI\'d love to get an if else statement in there so I can get aacv to ask me if I want to deploy when it\'s done and do that for me if I type \'y\', but I guess I should put that in my .zshrc fileI use the following alias for add all and commit:Then, by typing: I get a vim window to get more editing tools for my commit message.pretty sure you can use:I have this function in my .bash_profile or .profile or .zprofile or whatever gets sourced in login shells:I use this git alias:git config --global alias.cam \'!git commit -a -m \'So, instead of call git add -A && git commit -m "this is a great commit"I just do:git cam "this is a great commit"you can use \ngit commit -am "[comment]" // best solution \nor \ngit add . && git commit -m "[comment]"To keep it in one line use:
