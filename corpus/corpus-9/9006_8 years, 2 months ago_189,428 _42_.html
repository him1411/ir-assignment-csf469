My current query looks like this:I did some looking around and can\'t find anything similar to a LIKE IN() - I envision it working like this:Any ideas? Am I just thinking of the problem the wrong way - some obscure command I\'ve never seen.MySQL 5.0.77-community-logA REGEXP might be more efficient, but you\'d have to benchmark it to be sure, e.g.Paul Dixon\'s answer worked brilliantly for me. To add to this, here are some things I observed for those interested in using REGEXP:To Accomplish multiple LIKE filters with Wildcards:Use REGEXP Alternative:Values within REGEXP quotes and between the | (OR) operator are treated as wildcards. Typically, REGEXP will require wildcard expressions such as (.*)1740 (.*) to work as %1740 %.If you need more control over placement of the wildcard, use some of these variants:To Accomplish LIKE with Controlled Wildcard Placement:Use:Placing ^ in front of the value indicates start of the line.Placing $ after the value indicates end of line.Placing (.*) behaves much like the % wildcard.The . indicates any single character, except line breaks. Placing .\ninside () with * (.*) adds a repeating pattern indicating any number\nof characters till end of line.There are more efficient ways to narrow down specific matches, but that requires more review of Regular Expressions. NOTE: Not all regex patterns appear to work in MySQL statements. You\'ll need to test your patterns and see what works.Finally, To Accomplish Multiple LIKE and NOT LIKE filters:Use REGEXP Alternative:OR Mixed Alternative:Notice I separated the NOT set in a separate WHERE filter. I experimented with using negating patterns, forward looking patterns, and so on. However, these expressions did not appear to yield the desired results. In the first example above, I use ^9999$ to indicate exact match. This allows you to add specific matches with wildcard matches in the same expression. However, you can also mix these types of statements as you can see in the second example listed.Regarding performance, I ran some minor tests against an existing table and found no differences between my variations. However, I imagine performance could be an issue with  bigger databases, larger fields, greater record counts, and more complex filters.As always, use logic above as it makes sense.If you want to learn more about regular expressions, I recommend www.regular-expressions.info as a good reference site.You can create an inline view or a temporary table, fill it with you values and issue this:This, however, can return you multiple rows for a fiberbox that is something like \'1740, 1938\', so this query can fit you better:Regexp way with list of valuesSorry, there is no operation similar to LIKE IN in mysql.  If you want to use the LIKE operator without a join, you\'ll have to do it this way:You know, MySQL will not optimize that query, FYI.Flip operands This would be correct:You can get desired result with help of Regular Expressions.We can test the above query please click SQL fiddleWe can test the above query please click SQL fiddleJust note to anyone trying the REGEXP to use "LIKE IN" functionality.IN allows you to do:In REGEXP this won\'t workIt has to be in one line like this:Just a little tip: I prefer to use the variant RLIKE (exactly the same command as REGEXP) as it sounds more like natural language, and is shorter; well, just 1 char.The "R" prefix is for Reg. Exp., of course.
