I am looking for a concise way to convert an Iterator to a Stream or more specifically to "view" the iterator as a stream.For performance reason, I would like to avoid a copy of the iterator in a new list:Based on the some suggestions in the comments, I have also tried to use Stream.generate:However, I get a NoSuchElementException (since there is no invocation of hasNext)I have looked at StreamSupport and Collections but I didn\'t find anything.One way is to create a Spliterator from the Iterator and use that as a basis for your stream:An alternative which is maybe more readable is to use an Iterable - and creating an Iterable from an Iterator is very easy with lambdas because Iterable is a functional interface:Great suggestion! \nHere\'s my reusable take on it:And usage (make sure to statically import asStream):Since version 21, Guava library providesIt does what @assylias answer shows.Create Spliterator from Iterator using Spliterators class contains more than one function for creating spliterator, for example here am using spliteratorUnknownSize which is getting iterator as parameter, then create Stream using StreamSupportYou can simpy use limit function with iterator:
