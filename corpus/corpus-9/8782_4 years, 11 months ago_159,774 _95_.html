Does AngularJS help in any way with setting an active class on the link for the current page?I imagine there is some magical way this is done, but I can\'t seem to find.My menu looks like:and I have controllers for each of them in my routes: TasksController and ActionsController.But I can\'t figure out a way to bind the "active" class on the a links to the controllers.Any hints?on viewon controllerWith this the tasks link will have the active class in any url that starts with \'/tasks\'(e.g. \'/tasks/1/reports\')I suggest using a directive on a link.But its not perfect yet. Watch out for the hashbangs ;)Here is the javascript for directive:and here is how it would be used in html:afterwards styling with css:Here\'s a simple approach that works well with Angular. Within your AngularJS controller:This thread has a number of other similar answers.How to set bootstrap navbar active class with Angular JS?Just to add my two cents in the debate I have made a pure angular module (no jQuery), and it will also work with hash urls containing data. (e.g. #/this/is/path?this=is&some=data)You just add the module as a dependency and auto-active to one of the ancestors of the menu. Like this:And the module look like this:(You can of course just use the directive part)It\'s also worth noticing that this doesn\'t work for empty hashes (e.g. example.com/# or just example.com) it needs to have at least example.com/#/ or just example.com#/. But this happens automatically with ngResource and the like.And here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/gy2an/8/In my case I resolved this problem by creating a simple controller responsible for the navigationAnd by just adding ng-class to the element like so:The answer from @Renan-tomal-fernandes is good, but needed a couple of improvements to work correctly.\nAs it was, it\'d always detect the link to the home page ( / ) as triggered, even if you were in another section.So I improved it a little bit, here\'s the code.\nI work with Bootstrap so the active part is in the <li> element instead of the the <a>.ControllerTemplateFor AngularUI Router users:And that will place an active class on the object that is selected.There is a ng-class directive, which binds variable and css class.\nIt also accepts the object (className vs bool value pairs).Here is the example, http://plnkr.co/edit/SWZAqjHere is the solution that I came up with after reading some of the excellent suggestions above. In my particular situation, I was trying to use Bootstrap tabs component as my menu, but didn\'t want to use the Angular-UI version of this because I want the tabs to act as a menu, where each tab is bookmark-able, rather than the tabs acting as navigation for a single page. (See http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/tabs if you\'re interested in what the Angular-UI version of bootstrap tabs looks like).I really liked kfis\'s answer about creating your own directive to handle this, however it seemed cumbersome to have a directive that needed to be placed on every single link. So I\'ve created my own Angular directive which is placed instead once on the ul. Just in case any one else is trying to do the same thing, I thought I\'d post it here, though as I said, many of the above solutions work as well. This is a slightly more complex solution as far as the javascript goes, but it creates a reusable component with minimal markup.Here is the javascript for the directive and the route provider for ng:view:Then in your html you simply:Here\'s the plunker for it: http://plnkr.co/edit/xwGtGqrT7kWoCKnGDHYN?p=preview.You can implement this very simply, here is an example:And your Controller should be this:I had similar problem with menu located outside the controller scope. Not sure if this is best solution or a recommended one but this is what worked for me. I\'ve added the following to my app configuration:Then in the view I have: use angular-ui-router\'s ui-sref-active directive\nhttps://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Quick-Reference#statenameUsing a directive (since we are doing DOM manipulation here) the following is probably the closest to doing things the "angular way":Then your HTML would look like:I did it like this:This enables you to have links in a section that has track-active directive:This approach seems much cleaner than others, to me.Also, if you are using jQuery, you can make it a lot neater because jQlite only has basic selector support. A much cleaner version with jquery included before angular include would look like this:Here is a jsFiddleMy solution to this problem, use route.current in the angular template.As you have the /tasks route to highlight in your menu, you can add your own property menuItem to the routes declared by your module:Then in your template tasks.htmlyou can use following ng-class directive:In my opinion, this is much cleaner than all proposed solutions.Here is an extension on kfis directive that I did to allow for different levels of path matching.  Essentially I found the need for matching URL paths upto a certain depth, as exact matching doesn\'t allow for nesting and default state redirections.  Hope this helps.And here is how I use the linkThis directive will match the depth level specified in the attribute value for the directive.  Just means it can be used elsewhere many times over.Here is yet another directive to highlight active links.Simple example with angular expression, lets say $scope.var = 2, then link will be active if location is /url/2 :Bootstrap example, parent li will get active class:Example with nested urls, link will be active if any nested url is active (i.e. /url/1, /url/2, url/1/2/...)Complex example, link points to one url (/url1) but will be active if another is selected (/url2):Example with disabled link, if it is not active it will have \'disabled\' class:All active-link-* attributes can be used in any combination, so very complex conditions could be implemented.If you want the links for the directive in a wrapper rather than selecting each individual link (makes it easier to look at the scope in Batarang), this works pretty well too:Markup would just be:I should also mention that I am using \'full-fat\' jQuery in this example, but you can easily alter what I have done with the filtering and so on.According to @kfis \'s answer, it\'s comments, and my recommend, the final directive as below:and here is how it would be used in html:afterwards styling with css:For those using ui-router, my answer is somewhat similar to Ender2050\'s, but I prefer doing this via state name testing:corresponding HTML:None of the above directive suggestions were useful to me.  If you have a bootstrap navbar like this (that could be a $ yo angular startup) then you want to add .active to the parent <li> element class list, not the element itself; i.e <li class="active">..</li>. So I wrote this :usage set-parent-active; .active is default so not needed to be set and the parent <li> element will be .active when the link is active.  To use an alternative .active class like .highlight, simply Most important for me was not to change at all the bootstrap default code.\nHere it is my menu controller that search for menu options and then add the behavior we want.had same problem. Here is my solution:Here\'s my two cents, this works just fine.NOTE: This does not match childpages (which is what I needed).View:Controller:I just wrote a directive for this.Usage:Implementation:Tests:The route:The menu html:The controller:The problem I found here is that the menu item is active only when the full page is loaded. When the partial view is loaded the menu doesn\'t change. Somebody knows why it happens?Here is a much better way to do itI found the easiest solution. just to compare indexOf in HTML var myApp = angular.module(\'myApp\', []);
