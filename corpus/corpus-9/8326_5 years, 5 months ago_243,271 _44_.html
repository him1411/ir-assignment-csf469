I have this error when trying to browse php files locallywhat is the problem ?or defined by a module not included in the server configurationCheck to make sure you have mod_rewrite enabled.From: https://webdevdoor.com/php/mod_rewrite-windows-apache-url-rewritingIf the LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so line is missing from the httpd.conf file entirely, just add it.Under Apache 2+ you can simply do as below (Using Linux Terminal):sudo a2enmod rewrite && sudo service apache2 restart or  sudo a2enmod rewrite && sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart Just Follow Simple 1-2-3 Steps :1) Go to Taskbar 2) Click on WAMP icon (Left Click) 3) Now Go to Apache > Services > Apache Module and check Rewrite_module is enable or not \n  ! if its not then click on it ! WAMP will be automatically restarted and you\'re done !I can see that your using AppServ, mod_rewrite is disabled by default on that WAMP package (just googled it)Solution:Find: C:/AppServ/Apache/conf/httpd.conf file.and un-comment this line\n#LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.soRestart apache...\nSimplezThis comment from verybadbug under question helped me:After that we need restart Apache:Also make sure php is enabled by uncommenting the line that comes right afterMake sure both those lines inare uncommented. This error occurred for me because mod_rewrite was not enabled.\nEverything worked fine after enabling the rewrite module:\nhttp://www.debuntu.org/2006/06/15/66-how-to-enable-apache-modules-under-debian-based-system/2Steps to start Apache httpd.exe (I am using x64 VC11 example here)Be sure that you have installed Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 : VC11 vcredist_x64/86.exeYou may need to have Visual Studio 2012 Update 3 (VS2012.3)Unzip httpd-2.4.4-win64-VC11.zip and copy paste inUnzip modules-2.4-win64-VC11.zip and copy paste them inFor further info on the modules see the Apache Lounge VC10 Win64 download page and/or the readme in the .zip\'s there.Inun-comment (remove # sign) starting below this like copy pasted list in hereThen findand double click on it.Then in Command Prompt (CMD.exe) typeand press enter.
