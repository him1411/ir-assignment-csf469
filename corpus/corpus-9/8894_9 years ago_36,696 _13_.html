We\'re experimenting with various ways to throttle user actions in a given time period:For the time being, we\'re using the Cache to simply insert a record of user activity - if that record exists if/when the user does the same activity, we throttle.Using the Cache automatically gives us stale data cleaning and sliding activity windows of users, but how it will scale could be a problem.What are some other ways of ensuring that requests/user actions can be effectively throttled (emphasis on stability)?Here\'s a generic version of what we\'ve been using on Stack Overflow for the past year:Sample usage:The ASP.NET Cache works like a champ here - by using it, you get automatic clean-up of your throttle entries.  And with our growing traffic, we\'re not seeing that this is an issue on the server.Feel free to give feedback on this method; when we make Stack Overflow better, you get your Ewok fix even faster :)Microsoft has a new extension for IIS 7 called Dynamic IP Restrictions Extension for IIS 7.0 - Beta. "The Dynamic IP Restrictions for IIS 7.0 is a module that provides protection against denial of service and brute force attacks on web server and web sites. Such protection is provided by temporarily blocking IP addresses of the HTTP clients who make unusually high number of concurrent requests or who make large number of requests over small period of time."\n  http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/548/using-dynamic-ip-restrictions/Example:If you set the criteria to block after X requests in Y milliseconds or X concurrent connections in Y milliseconds the IP address will be blocked for Y milliseconds then requests will be permitted again.We use the technique borrowed from this URL http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/10ASPNetPerformance.aspx, not for throttling, but for a poor man\'s Denial Of Service (D.O.S).  This is also cache-based, and may be similar to what you are doing.  Are you throttling to prevent D.O.S. attacks?  Routers can certainly be used to reduce D.O.S; do you think a router could handle the throttling you need?
