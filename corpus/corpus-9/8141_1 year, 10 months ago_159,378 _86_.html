I want to make a move to Docker, so I\'ve just started to mess around with it. I\'ve installed Docker on a VirtualBox Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) installation and as suggested here I then tried running a basic nginx Docker image:So I checked out whether Docker was running:This suggests that the Docker daemon is actually already running, but to be sure I just started the Docker daemon manually:I then tried running the image again, but with the same result:I tried sudo\'ing the command, but to no avail. What am I doing wrong here? You need to add your current user [suppose you\'re logged in as ubuntu] to docker group as followthen logout & login again into the system or restart the system.\ntest by docker versionfor further info how to install docker-engine follow docker documentationAdd the user to the docker groupAdd the docker group if it doesn\'t already exist:sudo groupadd dockerAdd the connected user "${USER}" to the docker group:sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} dockerRestart the Docker daemon:sudo service docker restartEither do a newgrp docker or log out/in to activate the changes to\ngroups.Usually, the following command does the trick:This, instead of docker start for the cases where Docker seems to already be running. If that works then, as suggested and in another answer and on this GitHub issue, if you haven\'t added yourself in the docker group do it by running:And you\'re most likely good to go.As for anybody else bumping into this, in some OS\'s docker doesn\'t start right after you install it and, as a result, the same can\'t connect to daemon message appears. In this case you can first verify that Docker is indeed not running by checking the status of your docker service by executing:If the output looks something like: docker stop/waiting instead of docker start/running, process 15378 then it obviously means Docker is not active. In this case make sure you start it with:And, as before, you\'ll most likely be good to go.note to self: I get the error from the question\'s title when I forget to run docker command with sudo:sudo docker run ...[Ubuntu 15.10]After install everything and start the service, try close your terminal and open it again, then try pull your imageI also had this issue again, if the solution above won\'t worked, try this solution that is the command bellowIf command above works you probably are with network docker problems, anyway this resolves it, to confirm that, see the log with the command bellowIf the output have something like thatYou really are with network problems, however I do not know yet if the next time you restart(update, 2 months no issue again) your OS will get this problem again and if it is a bug or installation problemMy docker versionHad the same issue and what worked for me was:\nChecking the ownership of /var/run/docker.sock If you\'re not the owner then change ownership with the commandThen you can go ahead and try executing the docker commands hassle-free :DAfter installing docker on Ubuntu, I ran the following command:Have you tried it?I had the same problem. Been struggling for two days to solve it.It only worked when I did:According to Docker\'s Tutorial, you need to add the Docker key if not already added using:$ sudo wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -Then make sure you grant docker privileges to yourself using:$ sudo usermod -aG docker <yourUsernameHere>Hope this helps you too.For OSX: After opening docker and starting the \'default\' machine via the Quickstart Terminal (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/), you try docker commands and get this "can\'t connect to docker daemon" message, it turns out you need some env variables set:eval "$(docker-machine env default)"Then try it out with docker run hello-world to see if everything is peachy.enter as root (sudo su) and try this:I\'ve the same problem here, and the docker command only worked running as root, and also with this DOCKER_HOST emptyPS: also beware that the correct and official way to install on Ubuntu is to use their apt repositories (even on 15.10), not with that "wget" thing.This question is currently number 3 on a Google search.  After doing some research into solving this problem on my Linux system I thought I would write this answer.  The original post states the problem is on Ubuntu but I also experienced the issue using Fedora.  With that in mind, here is what I did to fix the problem. On Fedora 22Installing Docker:After installing Docker:A user needs to be added to the docker group.The docker daemon needs to be startedYou can set the daemon to start at bootYou can verify the docker service is runningAnd one last final checkFor the ones who already tried restarting your machine, unsetting the environment variable DOCKER_HOST as told in the docker env documentation and all the rest just try to go with the Only this did the trick for me even after restarting the machine.Add the docker group if it doesn\'t already exist.Add the connected user "${USER}" to the docker group.Change the user name to match your preferred user.You may have to logout and log back in again for\nthis to take effect.Restart the Docker daemon.Try to use "sudo" with the command you are running. I have same issue while running docker.you can run commands as sudo user:For Ubuntu:\nHappened with me when I updated docker.\nYou need to unmask the service and socket and then restart the service.\nFollowing worked for me:What happend behind the scenes\nsystemd also has the ability to mark a unit as completely unstartable, automatically or manually, by linking it to /dev/null. This is called masking the unit, and is possible with the mask command.You can check the list of masked services using:To enable auto/manual start of service you need to unmask it using:Now the service will be enabled as shown below\nAs docker binds to a  unix socket which is owned by root while starting up, using \'sudo\' along with the docker commands will work.I have faced same error on Amazon EC2 instance. The issue got fixed after restarting the instance.Add current user to docker group:sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)For Ubuntu 16.04Inside file /lib/systemd/system/docker.service change:with:Inside file /etc/init.d/docker change:with:and then restart your computer.
