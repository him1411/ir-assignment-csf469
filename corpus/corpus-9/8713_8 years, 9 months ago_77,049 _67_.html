How do you tell if caps lock is on using JavaScript?One caveat though: I did google it and the best solution I could find was to attach an onkeypress event to every input, then check each time if the letter pressed was uppercase, and if it was, then check if shift was also held down. If it wasn\'t, therefore caps lock must be on. This feels really dirty and just... wasteful - surely there\'s a better way than this?Found this interesting....\nYou can give it a try..For international characters, additional check can be added for the following keys as needed.  You have to get the keycode range for characters you are interested in, may be by using a keymapping array which will hold all the valid use case keys you are addressing...uppercase A-Z or \'\xc3\x84\', \'\xc3\x96\', \'\xc3\x9c\', \nlowercase a-Z or 0-9 or \'\xc3\xa4\', \'\xc3\xb6\', \'\xc3\xbc\'The above keys are just sample representation.In jQuery,Avoid the mistake, like the backspace key,  s.toLowerCase() !== s is needed.You can use a KeyboardEvent to detect numerous keys including the caps lock on most recent browsers.The getModifierState function will provide the state for:This demo works in all major browsers including mobile (caniuse).You can detect caps lock using "is letter uppercase and no shift pressed" using a keypress capture on the document. But then you better be sure that no other keypress handler pops the event bubble before it gets to the handler on the document.You could grab the event during the capturing phase in browsers that support that, but it seems somewhat pointless to as it won\'t work on all browsers.I can\'t think of any other way of actually detecting caps lock status. The check is simple anyway and if non detectable characters were typed, well... then detecting wasn\'t necessary.There was an article on 24 ways on this last year. Quite good, but lacks international character support (use toUpperCase() to get around that).Many existing answers will check for caps lock on when shift is not pressed but will not check for it if you press shift and get lowercase, or will check for that but will not also check for caps lock being off, or will check for that but will consider non-alpha keys as \'off\'. Here is an adapted jQuery solution that will show a warning if an alpha key is pressed with caps (shift or no shift), will turn off the warning if an alpha key is pressed without caps, but will not turn the warning off or on when numbers or other keys are pressed.In JQuery. This covers the event handling in Firefox and will check for both unexpected uppercase and lowercase characters. This presupposes an <input id="password" type="password" name="whatever"/>element and a separate element with id \'capsLockWarning\' that has the warning we want to show (but is hidden otherwise).I know this is an old topic but thought I would feed back in case it helps others. None of the answers to the question seem to work in IE8. I did however find this code that works in IE8. (Havent tested anything below IE8 yet). This can be easily modified for jQuery if required.And the function is called through the onkeypress event like this:The top answers here didn\'t work for me for a couple of reasons (un-commented code with a dead link and an incomplete solution). So I spent a few hours trying everyone\'s out and getting the best I could: here\'s mine, including jQuery and non-jQuery.Note that jQuery normalizes the event object so some checks are missing. I\'ve also narrowed it to all password fields (since that\'s the biggest reason to need it) and added a warning message. This has been tested in Chrome, Mozilla, Opera, and IE6-8. Stable and catches all capslock states EXCEPT when numbers or spaces are pressed.Some of the other jQuery-less solutions lacked IE fallbacks. @Zappa patched it.Note: Check out the solutions of @Borgar, @Joe Liversedge, and @Zappa, and the plugin developed by @Pavel Azanov, which I have not tried but is a good idea. If someone knows a way to expand the scope beyond A-Za-z, please edit away. Also, jQuery versions of this question are closed as duplicate, so that\'s why I\'m posting both here.This is a solution that, in addition to checking state when writing, also toggles the warning message each time the Caps Lock key is pressed (with some limitations). It also supports non-english letters outside the A-Z range, as it checks the string character against toUpperCase() and toLowerCase() instead of checking against character range.Note that observing caps lock toggling is only useful if we know the state of the caps lock before the Caps Lock key is pressed. The current caps lock state is kept with a caps JavaScript property on the password element. This is set the first time we have a validation of the caps lock state when the user presses a letter that can be upper or lower case. If the window loses focus, we can no longer observe caps lock toggling, so we need to reset to an unknown state.Recently there was a similar question on hashcode.com, and I created a jQuery plugin to deal with it. It also supports the recognition of caps lock on numbers. (On the standard German keyboard layout caps lock has effect on numbers).You can check the latest version here: jquery.capsCheckerFor jQuery with twitter bootstrapCheck caps locked for the following characters:uppercase A-Z or \'\xc3\x84\', \'\xc3\x96\', \'\xc3\x9c\', \'!\', \'"\', \'\xc2\xa7\', \'$\', \'%\', \'&\', \'/\', \'(\', \')\', \'=\', \':\', \';\', \'*\', \'\'\'lowercase a-Z or 0-9 or \'\xc3\xa4\', \'\xc3\xb6\', \'\xc3\xbc\', \'.\', \',\', \'+\', \'#\'live demo on jsfiddleThis code detects caps lock no matter the case or if the shift key is pressed:I wrote a library called capsLock which does exactly what you want it to do.Just include it on your web pages:Then use it as follows:See the demo: http://jsfiddle.net/3EXMd/The status is updated when you press the Caps Lock key. It only uses the Shift key hack to determine the correct status of the Caps Lock key. Initially the status is false. So beware.Yet another version, clear and simple, handles shifted capsLock, and not constrained to ascii I think:Edit: Sense of capsLockOn was reversed, doh, fixed.Edit #2: After checking this out some more, I\'ve made a few changes, a bit more detailed code unfortunately, but it handles more actions appropriately.Using e.charCode instead of e.keyCode and checking for 0 values skips a lot of non-character keypresses, without coding anything specific to a given language or charset. From my understanding, it\'s slightly less compatible, so older, non-mainstream, or mobile browsers may not behave as this code expects, but it\'s worth it, for my situation anyway.Checking against a list of known punctuation codes prevents them from being seen as false negatives, since they\'re not affected by caps lock. Without this, the caps lock indicator gets hidden when you type any of those punctuation characters. By specifying an excluded set, rather than an included one, it should be more compatible with extended characters. This is the ugliest, special-casiest bit, and there\'s some chance that non-Western languages have different enough punctuation and/or punctuation codes to be a problem, but again it\'s worth it IMO, at least for my situation.Based on answer of @joshuahedlund since it worked fine for me.I made the code a function so it can be reused, and linked it to the body in my case. It can be linked to the password field only if you prefer.In this below code it will be show alert when Caps lock on and they press key using shift. if we return false; then current char will not append to text page.try this out simple code in easy to understandThis is the ScriptAnd the Htmltry to use this code.    Good Luck :)You could use this script. It should work well on Windows even if the Shift key is pressed but it won\'t work on Mac OS if so.Here is a custom jquery plugin, using jquery ui, made up of all the good ideas on this page and leverages the tooltip widget.  The caps lock message is auto applied all password boxes and requires no changes to your current html.  Custom plug in code...Apply to all password elements...Javascript CodeWe now need to associate this script using HtmlA variable that shows caps lock state:works on all browsers => canIUseReactWhen you type, if caplock is on, it could automatically convert the current char to lowercase. That way even if caplocks is on, it will not behave like it is on the current page. To inform your users you could display a text saying that caplocks is on, but that the form entries are converted.There is a much simpler solution for detecting caps-lock:In jQuery:This jQuery plugin (code) implements the same idea as in Rajesh\'s answer a bit more succinctly.
