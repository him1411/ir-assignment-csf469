I want to put two <div>s next to each other. The right <div> is about 200px; and the left <div> must fill up the rest of the screen width? How can I do this?You can use flexbox to lay out your items:This is basically just scraping the surface of flexbox. Flexbox can do pretty amazing things.For older browser support, you can use CSS float and a width properties to solve it.I don\'t know if this is still a current issue or not but I just encountered the same problem and used the CSS display: inline-block; tag.\nWrapping these in a div so that they can be positioned appropriately. Note that the use of the inline style attribute was only used for the succinctness of this example of course these used be moved to an external CSS file.Unfortunately, this is not a trivial thing to solve for the general case. The easiest thing would be to add a css-style property "float: right;" to your 200px div, however, this would also cause your "main"-div to actually be full width and any text in there would float around the edge of the 200px-div, which often looks weird, depending on the content (pretty much in all cases except if it\'s a floating image).EDIT:\nAs suggested by Dom, the wrapping problem could of course be solved with a margin. Silly me.The method suggested by @roe and @MohitNanda work, but if the right div is set as float:right;, then it must come first in the HTML source. This breaks the left-to-right read order, which could be confusing if the page is displayed with styles turned off. If that\'s the case, it might be better to use a wrapper div and absolute positioning:Demonstrated:Edit: Hmm, interesting. The preview window shows the correctly formatted divs, but the rendered post item does not. Sorry then, you\'ll have to try it for yourself.I ran into this problem today. Based on the solutions above, this worked for me:Simply make the parent div span the full width and float the divs contained within.This will work OK as long as you set clear: both for the element that separates this two column block.UPDATEIf you need to place elements in a row, you can use Flex Layout. Here you have another Flex tutorial. It\'s a great CSS tool and even though it is not 100% compatible, each day its support is getting better. This works as simple as:HTMLCSSAnd what you get here is a container with a total size of 4 units, that share the space with its children in a relation of 1/4 and 3/4.I have done an example in CodePen that solves your problem. I hope it helps.http://codepen.io/timbergus/pen/aOoQLR?editors=110VERY OLDMaybe this is just a nonsense, but have you tried with a table? It not use directly CSS for positioning the divs, but it works fine.You can create a 1x2 table and put your divs inside, and then formatting the table with CSS to put them as you want:NoteIf you want to avoid using the table, as said before, you can use float: left; and float: right;and in the following element, don\'t forget to add a clear: left;, clear: right; or clear: both; in order to have the position cleaned.I ran into the same problem and Mohits version works. If you want to keep your left-right order in the html, just try this. In my case, the left div is adjusting the size, the right div stays at width 260px.HTMLCSSThe trick is to use a right padding on the main box but use that space again by placing the right box again with margin-right.As everyone has pointed out, you\'ll do this by setting a float:right; on the RHS content and a negative margin on the LHS.However.. if you don\'t use a float: left; on the LHS (as Mohit does) then you\'ll get a stepping effect because the LHS div is still going to consume the margin\'d space in layout.However.. the LHS float will shrink-wrap the content, so you\'ll need to insert a defined width childnode if that\'s not acceptable, at which point you may as well have defined the width on the parent.However.. as David points out you can change the read-order of the markup to avoid the LHS float requirement, but that\'s has readability and possibly accessibility issues.However.. this problem can be solved with floats given some additional markup(caveat: I don\'t approve of the .clearing div at that example, see here for details)All things considered, I think most of us wish there was a non-greedy width:remaining in CSS3...This won\'t be the answer for everyone, since it is not supported in IE7-, but you could use it and then use an alternate answer for IE7-. It is display: table, display: table-row and display: table-cell. Note that this is not using tables for layout, but styling divs so that things line up nicely with out all the hassle from above. Mine is an html5 app, so it works great.This article shows an example: http://www.sitepoint.com/table-based-layout-is-the-next-big-thing/Here is what your stylesheet will look like:I use a mixture of float and overflow-x:hidden. Minimal code, always works.https://jsfiddle.net/9934sc4d/4/ - PLUS you don\'t need to clear your float!To paraphrase one of my websites that does something similar:just use a z-index and everything will sit nice. make sure to have positions marked as fixed or absolute. then nothing will move around like with a float tag.
