Is it possible to set up files/folders to ignore on a per-project basis in TFS source control?For example, I\'ve a website with an assets folder that I do not want to go in to source control. These assets are maintained by a separate system. Also, I don\'t want to put several gigabytes of assets into source control, but I need a couple of samples on my dev machine, but I don\'t want to check those in either.If I\'m working on this website while bound to source control and I refresh the tree, these files will automatically get added againI want to prevent this from happening.The NuGet documentation provides instructions on how to accomplish this and I just followed them successfully for Visual Studio 2015 against VSTS (Azure-hosted TFS). Everything is fully updated as of Nov 2016. This also still works for Visual Studio 2017 RTM (March 2017).I recommend you follow NuGet\'s instructions but just to recap what I did:NuGet.config:.tfignore:While not mine, I have found this .tfignore template by sirkirby to be handy. The example in my answer covers the Nuget packages folder but this template includes some other things as well as provides additional examples that can be useful if you wish to customize this further.If you\'re using local workspaces (TFS 2012+) you can now use the .tfignore file to exclude local folders and files from being checked in.If you add that file to source control you can ensure others on your team share the same exclusion settings.Full details on MSDN - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms245454.aspx#tfignoreFor the lazy:You can configure which kinds of files are ignored by placing a text\n  file called .tfignore in the folder where you want rules to apply. The\n  effects of the .tfignore file are recursive. However, you can create\n  .tfignore files in sub-folders to override the effects of a .tfignore\n  file in a parent folder.The following rules apply to a .tfignore file:Example file:It does seem a little cumbersome to ignore files (and folders) in Team Foundation Server. I\'ve found a couple ways to do this (using TFS / Team Explorer / Visual Studio 2008). These methods work with the web site ASP project type, too.One way is to add a new or existing item to a project (e.g. right click on project, Add Existing Item or drag and drop from Windows explorer into the solution explorer), let TFS process the file(s) or folder, then undo pending changes on the item(s). TFS will unmark them as having a pending add change, and the files will sit quietly in the project and stay out of TFS.Another way is with the Add Items to Folder command of Source Control Explorer. This launches a small wizard, and on one of the steps you can select items to exclude (although, I think you have to add at least one item to TFS with this method for the wizard to let you continue).You can even add a forbidden patterns check-in policy (under Team -> Team Project Settings -> Source Control... -> Check-in Policy) to disallow other people on the team from mistakenly checking in certain assets. For TFS 2013:Start in VisualStudio-Team Explorer, in the PendingChanges Dialog undo the Changes whith the state [add], which should be ignored. Visual Studio will detect the Add(s) again. Click On "Detected: x add(s)"-in Excluded Changes In the opened "Promote Cadidate Changes"-Dialog You can easy exclude Files and Folders with the Contextmenu. Options are:Don\'t forget to Check In the changed .tfignore-File.For VS 2015/2017:The same procedure:\nIn the "Excluded Changes Tab" in TeamExplorer\\Pending Changes\nclick on Detected: xxx add(s)The "Promote Candidate Changes" Dialog opens, and on the entries you can Right-Click for the Contextmenu. Typo is fixed now :-)I\'m going to assume you are using Web Site Projects.  These automatically crawl their project directory and throw everything into source control.  There\'s no way to stop them.However, don\'t despair.  Web Application Projects don\'t exhibit this strange and rather unexpected (imho: moronic) behavior. WAP is an addon on for VS2005 and comes direct with VS2008.  As an alternative to changing your projects to WAP, you might consider moving the Assets folder out of Source control and into a TFS Document Library.  Only do this IF the project itself doesn\'t directly use the assets files.  I found the perfect way to Ignore files in TFS like SVN does.\nFirst of all, select the file that you want to ignore (e.g. the Web.config).\nNow go to the menu tab and select:   File  Source control > Advanced > Exclude web.config from source control ... and boom; your file is permanently excluded from source control.
