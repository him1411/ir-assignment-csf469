Please explain the following about the "Cannot find symbol" error:This question is designed to be a comprehensive question about "cannot find symbol" compilation errors in Java.Firstly, it is a compilation error1.  It means that either there is a problem in your Java source code, or there is a problem in the way that you are compiling it.Your Java source code consists of the following things:A "Cannot find symbol" error is about the identifiers.  When your code is compiled, the compiler needs to work out what each and every identifier in your code means.  A "Cannot find symbol" error means that the compiler cannot do this.  Your code appears to be referring to something that the compiler doesn\'t understand.As a first order, there is only one cause.  The compiler looked in all of the places where the identifier should be defined, and it couldn\'t find the definition.  This could be caused by a number of things.  The common ones are as follows:For identifiers that should be class names:Perhaps you forgot a new as in:For cases where type or instance doesn\'t appear to have the member you were expecting it to have:The problem is often a combination of the above.  For example, maybe you "star" imported java.io.* and then tried to use the Files class ... which is in java.nio not java.io.  Or maybe you meant to write File ... which is a class in java.io.Here is an example of how incorrect variable scoping can lead to a "Cannot find symbol" error:This will give a "Cannot find symbol" error for i in the if statement.  Though we previously declared i, that declaration is only in scope for the for statement and its body.  The reference to i in the if statement cannot see that declaration of i.  It is out of scope.(An appropriate correction here might be to move the if statement inside the loop, or to declare i before the start of the loop.)Here is an example that causes puzzlement where a typo leads to a seemingly inexplicable "Cannot find symbol" error:This will give you a compilation error in the println call saying that i cannot be found.  But (I hear you say) I did declare it!The problem is the sneaky semicolon before the {.  The Java language defines that to be an empty statement.  So that code actually means this:The { ... } block is NOT the body of the for loop, so the declaration of i is not in scope in the the block.Here is another example of "Cannot find symbol" error that is caused by a typo.Despite the previous declaration, the tmp in the tmp(...) expression is erroneous.  The compiler will look for a method called tmp, and won\'t find one.  The previously declared tmp is in the namespace for variables, not the namespace for methods.In the example I came across, the programmer had actually left out an operator.  What he meant to write was this:There is another reason why the compiler might not find a symbol if you are compiling from the command line.  You might simply have forgotten to compile or recompile some other class.  For example, if you have classes Foo and Bar where Foo uses Bar.  If you have never compiled Bar and you run javac Foo.java, you are liable to find that the compiler can\'t find the symbol Bar.  The simple answer is to Foo and Bar together; e.g. javac Foo.java Bar.java or javac *.java.  Or better still use a Java build tool; e.g. Ant, Maven, Gradle and so on.There are some other more obscure causes too ... which I will deal with below.Generally speaking, you start out by figuring out what caused the compilation error.Then you think about what your code is supposed to be saying.  Then finally you work out what correction you need to make to your source code to do what you want.Note that not every "correction" is correct. Consider this:Suppose that the compiler says "Cannot find symbol" for j.  There are many ways I could "fix" that:The point is that you need to understand what your code is trying to do in order to find the right fix.Here are a couple of cases where the "Cannot find symbol" is seemingly inexplicable ... until you look closer.You are looking at the wrong source code:  It often happens that a new Java programmers don\'t understand how the Java tool chain works, or haven\'t implemented a repeatable "build process"; e.g. using an IDE, Ant, Maven, Gradle and so on.  In such a situation, the programmer can end up chasing his tail looking for an illusory error that is actually caused by not recompiling the code properly, and the like ...IDE issues: People have reported cases where their IDE gets confused and the compiler in the IDE cannot find a class that exists ... or the reverse situation.  This can happen if the IDE\'s caches get out of sync with the file system.  There are IDE specific ways to fix that.This could be an IDE bug.  For instance @Joel Costigliola describes a scenario where Eclipse does not handle a Maven "test" tree correctly: see this answer.Redefining system classes: I\'ve seen cases where the compiler complains that substring is an unknown symbol in something like the followingIt turned out that the programmer had created their own version of String and that his version of the class didn\'t define a substring methods.Lesson: Don\'t define your own classes with the same names as common library classes!Homoglyphs:  If you use UTF-8 encoding for your source files, it is possible to have identifiers that look the same, but are in fact different because they contain homoglyphs.   See this page for more information.  You can avoid this by restricting yourself to ASCII or Latin-1 as the source file encoding, and using Java \\uxxxx escapes for other characters.1 - If, perchance, you do see this in a runtime exception or error message, then either you have configured your IDE to run code with compilation errors, or your application is generating and compiling code .. at runtime.You\'ll also get this error if you forget a new:versusOne more example of \'Variable is out of scope\'As I\'ve seen that kind of questions a few times already, maybe one more example to what\'s illegal even if it might feel okay.Consider this code:That\'s invalid code. Because neither of the variables named message is visible outside of their respective scope - which would be the surrounding brackets {} in this case. You might say: "But a variable named message is defined either way - so message is defined after the if". But you\'d be wrong. Java has no free() or delete operators, so it has to rely on tracking variable scope to find out when variables are no longer used (together with references to these variables of cause). It\'s especially bad if you thought you did something good. I\'ve seen this kind of error after "optimizing" code like this:"Oh, there\'s duplicated code, let\'s pull that common line out" -> and there it it.The  most common way to deal with this kind of scope-trouble would be to pre-assign the else-values to the variable names in the outside scope and then reassign in if:If you\'re getting this error in the build somewhere else, while your IDE says everything is perfectly fine, then check that you are using the same Java versions in both places.For example, Java 7 and Java 8 have different APIs, so calling a non-existent API in an older Java version would cause this error.One way to get this error in Eclipse : Result : Eclipse will compile the code, but maven will give "Cannot find symbol".Underlying cause : Eclipse is using a combined build path for the main and test trees.  Unfortunately, it does not support using different build paths for different parts of an Eclipse project, which is what Maven requires.Solution : I too was getting this error. (for which I googled and I was directed to this page)Problem: I was calling a static method defined in the class of a project A from a class defined in another project B. \nI was getting the following error:Solution: I resolved this by first building the project where the method is defined then the project where the method was being called from.For hints, look closer at the class name name that throws an error and the line number, example:\nCompilation failure\n[ERROR] \\applications\\xxxxx.java:[44,30] error: cannot find symbolOne other cause is unsupported method of for java version say jdk7 vs 8.\nCheck your %JAVA_HOME%
