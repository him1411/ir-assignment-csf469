How can I have a view render a partial (user control) from a different folder?\nWith preview 3 I used to call RenderUserControl with the complete path, but whith upgrading to preview 5 this is not possible anymore.\nInstead we got the RenderPartial method, but it\'s not offering me the functionality I\'m looking for.Just include the path to the view, with the file extension.Razor:ASP.NET engine:If that isn\'t your issue, could you please include your code that used to work with the RenderUserControl?In my case I was using MvcMailer (https://github.com/smsohan/MvcMailer) and wanted to access a partial view from another folder, that wasn\'t in "Shared."  The above solutions didn\'t work, but using a relative path did.If you are using this other path a lot of the time you can fix this permanently without having to specify the path all of the time. By default, it is checking for partial views in the View folder and in the Shared folder. But say you want to add one.Add a class to your Models folder:Then in your Global.asax.cs file, add the following line:For a user control named myPartial.ascx located at Views/Account folder write like this:The VirtualPathProviderViewEngine, on which the WebFormsViewEngine is based, is supposed to support the "~" and "/" characters at the front of the path so your examples above should work.I noticed your examples use the path "~/Account/myPartial.ascx", but you mentioned that your user control is in the Views/Account folder.  Have you tried <%Html.RenderPartial("~/Views/Account/myPartial.ascx");%>or is that just a typo in your question?I\'ve created a workaround that seems to be working pretty well. I found the need to switch to the context of a different controller for action name lookup, view lookup, etc. To implement this, I created a new extension method for HtmlHelper:ControllerContextRegion is defined as:The way this is used within a view is as follows:There may be unwanted side effects for this if your code requires the controller route component to not change, but in our code so far, there doesn\'t seem to be any negatives to this approach.you should try thisplace the ~/Views/ before your codeTry using RenderAction("myPartial","Account");
