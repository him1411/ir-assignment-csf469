I have a string in a Java server application that is accessed using AJAX. It looks something like the following:When the string gets pulled from the server, is there an easy way to turn this into a living JavaScript object (or array)? Or do I have to manually split the string and build my object manually?Modern browsers support JSON.parse().In browsers that don\'t, you can include the json2 library.The whole point of JSON is that JSON strings can be converted to native objects without doing anything. Check this linkYou can use either eval(string) or JSON.parse(string).However, eval is risky. From json.orgThe eval function is very fast.\n  However, it can compile and execute\n  any JavaScript program, so there can\n  be security issues. The use of eval is\n  indicated when the source is trusted\n  and competent. It is much safer to use\n  a JSON parser. In web applications\n  over XMLHttpRequest, communication is\n  permitted only to the same origin that\n  provide that page, so it is trusted.\n  But it might not be competent. If the\n  server is not rigorous in its JSON\n  encoding, or if it does not\n  scrupulously validate all of its\n  inputs, then it could deliver invalid\n  JSON text that could be carrying\n  dangerous script. The eval function\n  would execute the script, unleashing\n  its malice.Do like jQuery does! (the essence)This way you don\'t need any external library and it still works on old browsers.TO collect all item  of an array and return a json objectTO parse the same data we go through like this I don\'t see any reason why would you prefer to use eval its only puts your aplication at risk. That said.. just know that this is also possible.While JSON.parse throws Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position X. Function will not get executed - You are safe.eval() will execute the function and return the text. Imagin that I place the script to remove files from your website folder - hacked. No errors/warnings will get thrown in this example.So basicaly I was able to manipulate json text string in a way that it acts as a functino which will execute on the server while been accesed as regular string data. Calling eval(json)[0].adjacencies[0].nodeTo we would expect to access json string but in reality we just executed a function on our server. This could also be prevented if we serverside check user provided data while being a string before passing it to eval() function.And if you also want the deserialised object to have functions, you could use my small tool: https://github.com/khayll/jsmixIf you paste the string in server-side into the html don\'t need to do nothing:For plain java in jsp:For jsp width struts:I think this should help:Also documentations also prove that you can use require() for json files:\nhttps://www.bennadel.com/blog/2908-you-can-use-require-to-load-json-javascript-object-notation-files-in-node-js.htm
