I have a script that automates a process that needs access to a password protected system. The system is accessed via a command-line program that accepts the user password as an argument.I would like to prompt the user to type in their password, assign it to a shell variable, and then use that variable to construct the command line of the accessing program (which will of course produce stream output that I will process).  I am a reasonably competent shell programmer in Bourne/Bash, but I don\'t know how to accept the user input without having it echo to the terminal (or maybe having it echoed using \'*\' characters).  Can anyone help with this?Here is another way to do it:The read -s will turn off echo for you. Just replace the echo on the last line with the command you want to run.One liner: Under Linux (and cygwin) this form works in bash and sh. It may not be standard Unix sh, though.For more info and options, in bash, type "help read".The -s option of read is not defined in the POSIX standard. See http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/read.html. I wanted something that would work for any POSIX shell, so I wrote a little function that uses stty to disable echo.This function behaves quite similar to the read command. Here is a simple usage of read followed by similar usage of read_secret. The input to read_secret appears empty because it was not echoed to the terminal.Here is another that uses the -r option to preserve the backslashes in the input. This works because the read_secret function defined above passes all arguments it receives to the read command.Finally, here is an example that shows how to use the read_secret function to read a password in a POSIX compliant manner.Turn echo off using stty, then back on again after.I found to be the the askpass command usefulEvery input character is replaced by *. See: \nGive a password ****First of all if anyone is going to store any password in a file. I would make sure it\'s hashed. It\'s not the best security but at least it will not be in plaintext.First create the password and hash it:echo "password123" | md5sum  | cut -d \'-\' -f 1 > /tmp/secretNow create your program to use the hash, in this case this little program receives user input for a password without echoing and then converts it to hash to be compared with the stored hash. If it matches the stored hash then access is granted:#!/bin/bash
