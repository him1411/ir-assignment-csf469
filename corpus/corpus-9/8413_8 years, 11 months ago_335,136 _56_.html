Is there any class in the .NET framework that can read/write standard .ini files:Delphi has the TIniFile component and I want to know if there is anything similar for C#? The creators of the .NET framework want you to use XML-based config files, rather than INI files. So no, there is no built-in mechanism for reading them.There are third party solutions available, though.Firstly, read this MSDN blog post on the limitations of INI files. If it suits your needs, read on.This is a concise implementation I wrote, utilising the original Windows P/Invoke, so it is supported by all versions of Windows with .NET installed, (i.e. Windows 98 - Windows 10). I hereby release it into the public domain - you\'re free to use it commercially without attribution.Add a new class called IniFile.cs to your project:Open the INI file in one of the 3 following ways:You can write some values like so:To create a file like this:To read the values out of the INI file:Optionally, you can set [Section]\'s:To create a file like this:You can also check for the existence of a key like so:You can delete a key like so:You can also delete a whole section (including all keys) like so:Please feel free to comment with any improvements!This article on CodeProject "An INI file handling class using C#" should help.The author created a C# class "Ini" which exposes two functions from KERNEL32.dll. These functions are:  WritePrivateProfileString and GetPrivateProfileString. You will need two namespaces: System.Runtime.InteropServices and System.Text.Steps to use the Ini classIn your project namespace definition add Create a INIFile like thisUse IniWriteValue to write a new value to a specific key in a section or use IniReadValue to read a value FROM a key in a specific Section.Note: if you\'re beginning from scratch, you could read this MSDN article: How to: Add Application Configuration Files to C# Projects. It\'s a better way for configuring your application.I found this simple implementation:http://bytes.com/topic/net/insights/797169-reading-parsing-ini-file-cWorks well for what I need.Here is how you use it:Here is the code:The code in joerage\'s answer is inspiring.Unfortunately, it changes the character casing of the keys and does not handle comments. So I wrote something that should be robust enough to read (only) very dirty INI files and allows to retrieve keys as they are.It uses some LINQ, a nested case insensitive string dictionary to store sections, keys and values, and read the file in one go.I want to introduce an IniParser library I\'ve created completely in c#, so it contains no dependencies in any OS, which makes it Mono compatible. Open Source with MIT license -so it can be used in any code.You can check out the source in GitHub, and it is also available as a NuGet packageIt\'s heavily configurable, and really simple to use.Sorry for the shameless plug but I hope it can be of help of anyone revisiting this answer.You could use SharpConfig to read .cfg and/or .ini files. It\'s an easy to use config library for .NET.Usually, when you create applications using C# and the .NET framework, you will not use INI files. It is more common to store settings in an XML-based configuration file or in the registry. \nHowever, if your software shares settings with a legacy application it may be easier to use its configuration file, rather than duplicating the information elsewhere.The .NET framework does not support the use of INI files directly. However, you can use Windows API functions with Platform Invocation Services (P/Invoke) to write to and read from the files. In this link we create a class that represents INI files and uses Windows API functions to manipulate them. \nPlease go through the following link.Reading and Writing INI FilesThere is an Ini Parser available in CommonLibrary.NETThis has various very convenient overloads for getting sections/values and is very light weight.If you want just a simple reader without sections and any other dlls here is simple solution:Usage sample:Config file content meanwhile (as you see supports # symbol for line comment):Try this method:It creates the dictionary where the key is "-". You can load it like this:Here is my own version, using regular expressions. This code assumes that each section name is unique - if however this is not true - it makes sense to replace Dictionary with List. This function supports .ini file commenting, starting from \';\' character. Section starts normally [section], and key value pairs also comes normally "key = value". Same assumption as for sections - key name is unique.PeanutButter.INI is a Nuget-packaged class for INI files manipulation. It supports read/write, including comments \xe2\x80\x93 your comments are preserved on write. It appears to be reasonably popular, is tested and easy to use. It\'s also totally free and open-source.Disclaimer: I am the author of PeanutButter.INI.If you only need read access and not write access and you are using the Microsoft.Extensions.Confiuration (comes bundled in by default with ASP.NET Core but works with regular programs too) you can use the NuGet package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Ini to import ini files in to your configuration settings.I\'m late to join the party, but I had the same issue today and I\'ve written the following implementation:It must be noted, that this implementation does not handle sections or properties which are not found.\nTo achieve this, you should extend the Dictionary<,>-class to handle unfound keys.To serialize an instance of Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, string>> to an .ini-file, I use the following code:You should read and write data from xml files since you can save a whole object to xml and also you can populate a object from a saved xml. It is better an easy to manipulate objects.Here is how to do it:\nWrite Object Data to an XML File: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms172873.aspx\nRead Object Data from an XML File: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms172872.aspx
