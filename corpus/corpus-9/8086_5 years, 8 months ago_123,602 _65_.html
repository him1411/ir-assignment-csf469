I\'m using a ViewPager together with a FragmentStatePagerAdapter to host three different fragments:When I want to get Fragment1 from the ViewPager in the FragmentActivity. What is the problem, and how do I fix it?The main answer relies on a name being generated by the framework. If that ever changes, then it will no longer work.What about this solution, overriding instantiateItem() and destroyItem() of your Fragment(State)PagerAdapter:This seems to work for me when dealing with Fragments that are available. Fragments that have not yet been instantiated, will return null when calling getRegisteredFragment. But I\'ve been using this mostly to get the current Fragment out of the ViewPager: adapater.getRegisteredFragment(viewPager.getCurrentItem()) and this won\'t return null.I\'m not aware of any other drawbacks of this solution. If there are any, I\'d like to know.For grabbing fragments out of a ViewPager there are a lot of answers on here and on other related SO threads / blogs. Everyone I have seen is broken, and they generally seem to fall into one of the two types listed below. There are some other valid solutions if you only want to grab the current fragment, like this other answer on this thread.If using FragmentPagerAdapter see below. If using FragmentStatePagerAdapter its worth looking at this. Grabbing indexes that are not the current one in a FragmentStateAdapter is not as useful as by the nature of it these will be completely torn down went out of view / out of offScreenLimit bounds.Wrong: Maintain your own internal list of fragments, added to when FragmentPagerAdapter.getItem() is calledWrong: Construct your own tag id matching what is used under the hood in FragmentPagerAdapter and use this to retrieve the page Fragments from the FragmentManagerThe method thats recreated for this solution is A similar approach to getItem() above but non-lifecycle-breaking is to this is to hook into instantiateItem() instead of getItem() as the former will be called everytime that index is created / accessed. See this answerConstruct your own FragmentViewPager class from the source of the latest support lib and change the method used internally to generate the fragment tags. You can replace it with the below. This has the advantage that you know the tag creation will never change and your not relying on a private api / method, which is always dangerous.Then as the doc says, when you want to grab a fragment used for an index just call something like this method (which you can put in the custom FragmentPagerAdapter or a subclass) being aware the result may be null if getItem has not yet been called for that page i.e. its not been created yet.This is a simple solution and solves the issues in the other two solutions found everywhere on the webAdd next methods to your FragmentPagerAdapter:getActiveFragment(0) has to work. Here is the solution implemented into ViewPager https://gist.github.com/jacek-marchwicki/d6320ba9a910c514424d. If something fail you will see good crash log. Another simple solution:I know this has a few answers, but maybe this will help someone. I have used a relatively simple solution when I needed to get a Fragment from my ViewPager. In your Activity or Fragment holding the ViewPager, you can use this code to cycle through every Fragment it holds. If you know the position of your Fragment in the ViewPager, you can just call getItem(knownPosition).If you don\'t know the position of your Fragment in the ViewPager, you can have your children Fragments implement an interface with a method like getUniqueId(), and use that to differentiate them. Or you can cycle through all Fragments and check the class type, such as if(viewPagerFragment instanceof FragmentClassYouWant)!!! EDIT !!!I have discovered that getItem only gets called by a FragmentPagerAdapter when each Fragment needs to be created the first time, after that, it appears the the Fragments are recycled using the FragmentManager. This way, many implementations of FragmentPagerAdapter create new Fragments in getItem. Using my above method, this means we will create new Fragments each time getItem is called as we go through all the items in the FragmentPagerAdapter. Due to this, I have found a better approach, using the FragmentManager to get each Fragment instead (using the accepted answer). This is a more complete solution, and has been working well for me.And you will need this method.For my case, none of the above solutions worked.However since I am using the Child Fragment Manager in a Fragment, the following was used:Fragment f = getChildFragmentManager().getFragments().get(viewPager.getCurrentItem());This will only work if your fragments in the Manager correspond to the viewpager item.This is based on Steven\'s answer above. This will return actual instance of the fragment which is already attached to the parent activity.                    I couldn\'t find a simple, clean way to do this. However, the ViewPager widget is just another ViewGroup , which hosts your fragments. The ViewPager has these fragments as immediate children. So you could just iterate over them (using .getChildCount() and .getChildAt() ), and see if the fragment instance that you\'re looking for is currently loaded into the ViewPager and get a reference to it. E.g. you could use some static unique ID field to tell the fragments apart.Note that the ViewPager may not have loaded the fragment you\'re looking for since it\'s a virtualizing container like ListView.FragmentPagerAdapter is the factory of the fragments. To find a fragment based on its position if still in memory use this:Sample code for v4 support api.I handled it by first making a list of all the fragments (List<Fragment> fragments;) that I was going to use then added them to the pager making it easier to handle the currently viewed fragment.So:so then this can be called:so then i could chuck it in an if statement that would only run if it was on the correct fragmentbut thats just my hack and slash approach but it worked for me, I use it do do relevent changes to my currently displayed fragment when the back button is pushed.In order to get current Visible fragment from ViewPager. I am using this simple statement and it\'s working fine.You don\'t need to call getItem() or some other method at later stage to get the reference of a Fragment hosted inside ViewPager. If you want to update some data inside Fragment then use this approach: Update ViewPager dynamically?Key is to set new data inside Adaper and call notifyDataSetChanged() which in turn will call getItemPosition(), passing you a reference of your Fragment and giving you a chance to update it. All other ways require you to keep reference to yourself or some other hack which is not a good solution.Best solution is to use the extension we created at CodePath called SmartFragmentStatePagerAdapter. Following that guide, this makes retrieving fragments and the currently selected fragment from a ViewPager significantly easier. It also does a better job of managing the memory of the fragments embedded within the adapter.The easiest and the most concise way. If all your fragments in ViewPager are of different classes you may retrieve and distinguish them as following:I implemented this easy with a bit different approach.My custom FragmentAdapter.getItem method returned not new MyFragment(), but the instance of MyFragment that was created in FragmentAdapter constructor. In my activity I then got the fragment from the adapter, check if it is instanceOf needed Fragment, then cast and use needed methods.index is the place of fragment in adapter like you added fragment1 first so retreive fragment1 pass index as 0 and so on for restCreate integer resource id in /values/integers.xmlThen in PagerAdapter getItem function:Then in activity write this function to get fragment reference:Get the fragment reference by calling the above function and then cast it to your custom fragment:Easy way to iterate over fragments in fragment manager. Find viewpager, that has section position argument, placed in  public static PlaceholderFragment newInstance(int sectionNumber).In FragmentIn FragmentActivityMust extends FragmentPagerAdapter into your ViewPager adapter class.\nIf you use FragmentStatePagerAdapter then you will not able to find your Fragment by its IDHow to use this method :-Ok for the adapter FragmentStatePagerAdapter I fund a solution :in your FragmentActivity :and create a methode in your class FragmentActivity - So that method give you access to your Fragment, you just need to give it the position of the fragment you want:in your Adapter : This easy solution worked fine for me.YourFragment fragment =\n (YourFragment)getSupportFragmentManager().getFragments().get(0);(If you know your fragment position in the list, then the above solution will work)
