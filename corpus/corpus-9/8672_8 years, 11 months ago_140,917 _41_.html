Is it possible to log out user from a web site if he is using basic authentication?Killing session is not enough, since, once user is authenticated, each request contains login info, so user is automatically logged in next time he/she access the site using the same credentials.The only solution so far is to close browser, but that\'s not acceptable from the usability standpoint.Basic Authentication wasn\'t designed to manage logging out. You can do it, but not completely automatically.What you have to do is have the user click a logout link, and send a \xe2\x80\x98401 Unauthorized\xe2\x80\x99 in response, using the same realm and at the same URL folder level as the normal 401 you send requesting a login.They must be directed to input wrong credentials next, eg. a blank username-and-password, and in response you send back a \xe2\x80\x9cYou have successfully logged out\xe2\x80\x9d page. The wrong/blank credentials will then overwrite the previous correct credentials.In short, the logout script inverts the logic of the login script, only returning the success page if the user isn\'t passing the right credentials.The question is whether the somewhat curious \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t enter your password\xe2\x80\x9d password box will meet user acceptance. Password managers that try to auto-fill the password can also get in the way here.Edit to add in response to comment: re-log-in is a slightly different problem (unless you require a two-step logout/login obviously). You have to reject (401) the first attempt to access the relogin link, than accept the second (which presumably has a different username/password). There are a few ways you could do this. One would be to include the current username in the logout link (eg. /relogin?username), and reject when the credentials match the username.An addition to the answer by bobince ...With Ajax you can have your \'Logout\' link/button wired to a Javascript function. Have this function send the XMLHttpRequest with a bad username and password. This should get back a 401. Then set document.location back to the pre-login page. This way, the user will never see the extra login dialog during logout, nor have to remember to put in bad credentials.Have the user click on a link to https://log:out@example.com/. That will overwrite existing credentials with invalid ones; logging them out.You can do it entirely in JavaScript:IE has (for a long time) standard API for clearing Basic Authentication cache:Should return true when it works. Returns either false, undefined or blows up on other browsers.New browsers (as of Dec 2012: Chrome, FireFox, Safari) have "magic" behavior. If they see a successful basic auth request with any bogus other username (let\'s say logout) they clear the credentials cache and possibly set it for that new bogus user name, which you need to make sure is not a valid user name for viewing content.Basic example of that is:An "asynchronous" way of doing the above is to do an AJAX call utilizing the logout username. Example:You can make it a bookmarklet too: javascript:(function(c){var a,b="You should be logged out now.";try{a=document.execCommand("ClearAuthenticationCache")}catch(d){}a||((a=window.XMLHttpRequest?new window.XMLHttpRequest:window.ActiveXObject?new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"):void 0)?(a.open("HEAD",c||location.href,!0,"logout",(new Date).getTime().toString()),a.send(""),a=1):a=void 0);a||(b="Your browser is too old or too weird to support log out functionality. Close all windows and restart the browser.");alert(b)})(/*pass safeLocation here if you need*/);The following function is confirmed working for Firefox 40, Chrome 44, Opera 31 and IE 11.\nBowser is used for browser detection, jQuery is also used.\n- secUrl is the url to a password protected area from which to log out.\n- redirUrl is the url to a non password protected area (logout success page).\n\n- you might wish to increase the redirect timer (currently 200ms).This isn\'t directly possible with Basic-Authentication.There\'s no mechanism in the HTTP specification for the server to tell the browser to stop sending the credentials that the user already presented.There are "hacks" (see other answers) typically involving using XMLHttpRequest to send an HTTP request with incorrect credentials to overwrite the ones originally supplied.Here\'s a very simple Javascript example using jQuery:This log user out without showing him the browser log-in box again, then redirect him to a logged out pageThis is working for IE/Netscape/Chrome :It\'s actually pretty simple.Just visit the following in your browser and use wrong credentials:\nhttp://username:password@yourdomain.comThat should "log you out".Based on what I read above I got a simple solution that works on any browser:1) on you logout page you call an ajax to your login back end. Your login back end must accept logout user. Once the back end accept, the browser clear the current user and assumes the "logout" user.2) Now when the user got back to the normal index file it will try to automatic enter in the system with the user "logout", on this second time you must block it by reply with 401 to invoke the login/password dialog.3) There are many ways to do that, I created two login back ends, one that accepts the logout user and one that doesn\'t. My normal login page use the one that doesn\'t accept, my logout page use the one that accepts it.This JavaScript must be working for all latest version browsers:add this to your application :All you need is redirect user on some logout URL and return 401 Unauthorized error on it. On error page (which must be accessible without basic auth) you need to provide a full link to your home page (including scheme and hostname). User will click this link and browser will ask for credentials again.Example for Nginx:Error page /home/user/errors/401.html:I updated mthoring\'s solution for modern Chrome versions:
