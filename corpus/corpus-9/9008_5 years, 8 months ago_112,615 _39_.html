I need to use some google fonts on an intranet application. The clients  may or may not have internet connection. Reading the license terms, it appears that its legally allowed.Please keep in mind that my answer has aged a bit. There are other more technically sophisticated answers below, e.g.:so don\'t let the fact that this is the currently accepted answer give you the impression that this is still the best one.You can also now also download google\'s entire font set via on github at their google/font repository. They also provide a ~350MB zip snapshot of their fonts.You first download your font selection as a zipped package, providing you with a bunch of true type fonts. Copy them somewhere public, somewhere you can link to from your css.On the google webfont download page, you\'ll find a include link like so:It links to a CSS defining the fonts via a bunch of @font-face defintions.Open it in a browser to copy and paste them into your own CSS and modify the urls to include the right font file and format types.So this:becomes this:As you can see, a downside of hosting the fonts on your own system this way is, that you restrict yourself to the true type format, whilst the google webfont service determines by the accessing device which formats will be transmitted.Furthermore, I had to add a .htaccess file to my the directory holding the fonts containing mime types to avoid errors from popping up in Chrome Dev Tools.For this solution, only true type is needed, but defining more does not hurt when you want to include different fonts as well, like font-awesome.There is a tool localfont.com to help you download all font variants. It as well generates the corresponding CSS for implementation.Great solution is google-webfonts-helper\n.It allows you to select more than one font variant, which saves a lot of time.I wrote a bash script that fetches the CSS file on Google\'s servers with different user agents, downloads the different font formats to a local directory and writes a CSS file including them. Note that the script needs Bash version 4.x.See https://neverpanic.de/blog/2014/03/19/downloading-google-web-fonts-for-local-hosting/ for the script (I\'m not reproducing it here so I only have to update it in one place when I need to).Edit: Moved to https://github.com/neverpanic/google-font-downloadThe contents of the CSS file (from the include URL) depends on what browser I view it from. For example, when browsing to http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans using Chrome, the file only contained WOFF links. Using Internet Explorer (below), it included both EOT and WOFF. I pasted all the links into my browser to download them.When you host your own web fonts, you need to correctly link to each font type, deal with legacy browser bugs, etc. When you use Google Web Fonts (hosted by Google), Google automatically links to the correct font types for that browser.It is legally allowed as long as you stick to the terms of the font\'s license - usually the OFL. You\'ll need a set of web font formats, and the Font Squirrel Webfont Generator can produce these. But the OFL required the fonts be renamed if they are modified, and using the generator means modifying them. I have a script written in PHP similar to that of @neverpanic that automatically downloads both the CSS and fonts (both hinted and unhinted) from Google. It then serves the correct CSS and fonts from your own server based on the User Agent. It keeps its own cache, so fonts and CSS of a User Agent will only be downloaded once.It\'s in a premature stage, but it can be found here: DaAwesomeP / php-offline-fontsI used grunt-local-googlefont in a grunt task.Then, to retrieve them:Note, I\'m using a fork from the original, which works better when retrieving fonts with whitespaces in their names.You can actually download all font format variants directly from Google and include them in your css to serve from your server. That way you don\'t have to concern about Google tracking your site\'s users. However, the downside maybe slowing down your own serving speed. Fonts are quite demanding on resources. I have not done any tests in this issue yet, and wonder if anyone has similar thoughts.My solution was to download the TTF files from google web fonts and then use onlinefontconverter.com.In addition to k0pernicus I would like to suggest best-served-local. It\'s also a bash (v4) script to enable webserver operators to download and serve Google web fonts from their own webserver. But in addition to the other bash script, it lets the user fully automate (via cron and such) the serving of up-to-date font files and css-files.I made a tiny PHP script to get download links from a Google Fonts CSS import URL like: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,700|Slabo+27px|Lato:400,300italic,900italicYou can use this tool here: http://nikoskip.me/gfonts.phpFor instance, if you use the above import URL, you will get this:If you want to host all fonts (or some of them) at your own server, you a download fonts from this repo and use it the way you want: https://github.com/praisedpk/Local-Google-FontsThere is a very simple script, written in plain Java, to download all fonts from a Google Web Font link (multiple fonts supported). It also downloads the CSS file and adapts it to local files. The user-agent can be adapted to get also other files than only WOFF2. See https://github.com/ssc-hrep3/google-font-downloadThe resulting files can easily be added to a build process (e.g. a webpack build like vue-webpack).
