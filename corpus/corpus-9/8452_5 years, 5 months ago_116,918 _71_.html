I created a toolbar in IB with several buttons. I would like to be able to hide/show one of the buttons depending on the state of the data in the main window. UIBarButtonItem doesn\'t have a hidden property, and any examples I\'ve found so far for hiding them involve setting nav bar buttons to nil, which I don\'t think I want to do here because I may need to show the button again (not to mention that, if I connect my button to an IBOutlet, if I set that to nil I\'m not sure how I\'d get it back).Save your button in a strong outlet (let\'s call it myButton) and do this to add/remove it:Because it is stored in the outlet, you will keep a reference to it even when it isn\'t on the toolbar.I know this answer is late for this question. However, it might help if anybody else faces a similar situation.In iOS 7, to hide a bar button item, we can use the following two techniques :-To hide the button, I used the following code:-To show the button again I used the following code:- Here\'s a simple approach:I just ran it on my retina iPad, and .01 is small enough for it to not show up.It is possible to hide a button in place without changing its width or removing it from the bar. If you set the style to plain, remove the title, and disable the button, it will disappear. To restore it, just reverse your changes. Below is my solution though i was looking it for Navigation Bar.Here "navBar" is a IBOutlet to the NavigationBar in the view in XIB\nHere i wanted to hide the button or show it based on some condition. So i m testing for the condition in "If" and if true i am setting the button to nil in viewDidLoad method of the target view.This may not be relevant to your problem exactly but something similar incase if you want to hide buttons on NavigationBarI am currently running OS X Yosemite Developer Preview 7 and Xcode 6 beta 6 targeting iOS 7.1 and following solution works fine for me:Run following code to removeRun following codes to add buttons againI used IBOutlets in my project. So my solution was:And when you\'ll need to show this bar again, just set reversed properties.In Swift 3 instead enable use isEnable property.iOS 8. UIBarButtonItem with custom image.\nTried many different ways, most of them were not helping.\nMax\'s solution, thesetTintColor was not changing to any color.\nI figured out this one myself, thought it will be of use to some one.For Hiding:For Showing:self.dismissButton.customView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 0, 0)];Try in Swift, don\'t update the tintColor if you have some design for your UIBarButtonItem like font size in AppDelegate, it will totally change the appearance of your button when showing up.In case of a text button, changing title can let your button \'disappear\'.For Swift 3 and Swift 4 you can do this to hide the UIBarButtomItem:And to show the UIBarButtonItem:On the tintColor you must have to specify the origin color you are using for the UIBarButtomItemThere is no way to "hide" a UIBarButtonItem you must remove it from the superView and add it back when you want to display it again. And now simply change isHidden property.One way to do it is use the  initWithCustomView:(UIView *) property of when allocating the UIBarButtonItem. Subclass for UIView will have hide/unhide property.For example:1. Have  a UIButton which you want to hide/unhide.2. Make the UIButtonas the custom view. Like : 3. You can hide/unhide the myButton you\'ve created. [myButton setHidden:YES];Improving From @lnafziger answerSave your Barbuttons in a strong outlet and do this to hide/show it:When ever required use below Function..This is long way down the answer list, but just in case somebody wants an easy copy and paste for the swift solution, here it isSetting the text color to a clear color when the bar button item is disabled is probably a cleaner option. There\'s no weirdness that you have to explain in a comment. Also you don\'t destroy the button so you still keep any associated storyboard segues.Then when ever you want the bar button item hidden, you can just do:It\'s lame there\'s no hidden property but this offers the same result.In case the UIBarButtonItem has an image instead of the text in it you can do this to hide it:\n    navigationBar.topItem.rightBarButtonItem.customView.alpha = 0.0;Some helper methods I thought I\'d share based upon lnafziger\'s accepted answer as I have multiple toolbars and multiple buttons in each:You can easily get the view and hide it this wayComplementing Eli Burke`s response, if your UIBarButtonItemhas a background image instead of a title, you can use the code:For Swift version, here is the code:For UINavigationBar:If you are using Swift 3 You need to manipulate the toolbar.items array.Here is some code I use to hide and display a Done button. If your button is on the extreme edge of the toolbar or in-between other buttons your other buttons will move, so if you want your button to just disappear then place your button as the last button towards the centre. I animate the button move for effect, I quite like it.}so now can use the following code to show your buttonor to hide your button  In IB if you leave the button\'s title blank it will not appear (never initialized?). I do this often during development during UI updates if I want a bar button item to temp disappear for a build without deleting it and trashing all its outlet references. This does not have the same effect during runtime, setting the button\'s title to nil will not cause it the whole button to disappear. Sorry doesn\'t really answer your question, but may be useful to some.Edit: This trick only works if the button\'s style is set to plainI\'ll add my solution here as I couldn\'t find it mentioned here yet. I have a dynamic button whose image depends on the state of one control. The most simple solution for me was to set the image to nil if the control was not present. The image was updated each time the control updated and thus, this was optimal for me. Just to be sure I also set the enabled to NO.Setting the width to a minimal value did not work on iOS 7.With credit to @lnafziger, @MindSpiker, @vishal, et. al,The simplest one liner that I arrived at for a single right (or left) bar button is:As in:I tested this and it works for me (with the strong bar button item wired via IB).Subclass UIBarButtonItem.\nMake sure the button in Interface Builder is set to HidableBarButtonItem.\nMake an outlet from the button to the view controller. From the view controller you can then hide/show the button by calling setHidden:HidableBarButtonItem.hHidableBarButtonItem.mI worked with xib and with UIToolbar. BarButtonItem was created in xib file. I created IBOutlet for BarButtonItem. And I used this code to hide my BarButtonItemthis helped me.You can use text attributes to hide a bar button:Also see my solution with UIBarButtonItem extension for the similar question: Make a UIBarButtonItem disapear using swift IOS
