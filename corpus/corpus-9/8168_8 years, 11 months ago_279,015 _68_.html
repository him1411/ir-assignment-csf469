Given a template where the HTML cannot be modified because of other requirements, how is it possible to display (rearrange) a div above another div when they are not in that order in the HTML? Both divs contain data that varies in height and width.Hopefully it is obvious that the desired result is:When the dimensions are fixed it easy to position them where needed, but I need some ideas for when the content is variable. For the sake of this scenario, please just consider the width to be 100% on both.Edit: A CSS solution is the most ideal solution. Thank you for the Javascript options mentioned. Without getting too wordy about what or why (or who) ... I am specifically looking for a CSS only solution (and it will probably have to be met with other solutions if that doesn\'t pan out). One more ... there are other elements following this. A good suggestion was mentioned given the limited scenario I demonstrated -- given that it might be the best answer, but I am looking to also make sure elements following this aren\'t impacted.This solution uses only CSS and works with variable contentA CSS only solution (works for IE10+) \xe2\x80\x93 use Flex Box\'s order property:Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/hqya7q6o/596/More info: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/orderAs others have said, this isn\'t something you\'d want to be doing in CSS. You can fudge it with absolute positioning and strange margins, but it\'s just not a robust solution. The best option in your case would be to turn to javascript. In jQuery, this is a very simple task:or more generically:There is absolutely no way to achieve what you want through CSS alone -- unless:If the above are true then you can do what you want by absolutely positioning the elements --Again, if you don\'t know the height want for at least #firstDiv, there\'s no way you can do  what you want via CSS alone.  If any of this content is dynamic, you will have to use javascript.This can be done using Flexbox. Create a container that applies both display:flex and flex-flow:column-reverse.Sources:Here\'s a solution:But I suspect you have some content that follows the wrapper div...If you know, or can enforce the size for the to-be-upper element, you could use In your css and give the divs their position.otherwise javascript seems the only way to go:or something similar.edit: I just found this which might be useful: w3 document css3 move-toNegative top margins can achieve this effect, but they would need to be customized for each page.  For instance, this markup......and this CSS......would allow you to pull the second paragraph above the first.Of course, you\'ll have to manually tweak your CSS for different description lengths so that the intro paragraph jumps up the appropriate amount, but if you have limited control over the other parts and full control over markup and CSS then this might be an option.Well, with a bit of absolute positioning and some dodgy margin setting, I can get close, but it\'s not perfect or pretty:The "margin-top: 4em" is the particularly nasty bit: this margin needs to be adjusted according to the amount of content in the firstDiv. Depending on your exact requirements, this might be possible, but I\'m hoping anyway that someone might be able to build on this for a solid solution.Eric\'s comment about javascript should probably be pursued.you just need this!\nin css float first div by left or right.\nfloat second div by left or right same as first.\nclear left or right same as above two div for second div.\nfor example:Have fun my friend.I was looking for a way to change the orders of the divs only for mobile version so then I can style it nicely. Thanks to nickf reply I got to make this piece of code which worked well for what I wanted, so i though of sharing it with you guys:With CSS3 flexbox layout module, you can order divs.This can be done with CSS only! Please check my answer to this similar question:https://stackoverflow.com/a/25462829/1077230I don\'t want to double post my answer but the short of it is that the parent needs to become a flexbox element. Eg: (only using the webkit vendor prefix here.)Then, swap divs around by indicating their order with:Just use flex for the parent div by specifying display: flex and flex-direction : column.\nThen use order to determine which of the child div comes firstA solution with a bigger browser support then the flexbox (works in IE\xe2\x89\xa59):In contrast to the display: table; solution this solution works when .wrapper has any amount of children.CSS really shouldn\'t be used to restructure the HTML backend. However, it is possible if you know the height of both elements involved and are feeling hackish. Also, text selection will be messed up when going between the divs, but that\'s because the HTML and CSS order are opposite.Where XXX and YYY are the heights of firstDiv and secondDiv respectively. This will work with trailing elements, unlike the top answer.I have a much better code, made by me, it is so big, just to show both things... create a 4x4 table and vertical align more than just one cell.It does not use any IE hack, no vertical-align:middle; at all... It does not use for vertical centering display-table, display:table-rom; display:table-cell;It uses the trick of a container that has two divs, one hidden (position is not the correct but makes parent have the correct variable size), one visible just after the hidden but with top:-50%; so it is mover to correct position.See div classes that make the trick:\n BloqueTipoContenedor\n   BloqueTipoContenedor_VerticalmenteCentrado\n     BloqueTipoContenido_VerticalmenteCentrado_Oculto\n     BloqueTipoContenido_VerticalmenteCentrado_VisiblePlease sorry for using Spanish on classes names (it is because i speak spanish and this is so tricky that if i use English i get lost).The full code:Little late to the party, but you can also do this:Or set an absolute position to the element and work off the margins by declaring them from the edge of the page rather than the edge of the object. Use % as its more suitable for other screen sizes ect. This is how i overcame the issue...Thanks, hope its what your looking for...You can do it using CSS3 Flex property, for any kind of order hierarchy:\nHTMLCSSFiddle link: http://jsfiddle.net/tabblack/g614860L/For CSS Only solution\n1.
