I\'ve been reading a lot of stuff about functional programming lately, and I can understand most of it, but the one thing I just can\'t wrap my head around is stateless coding.  It seems to me that simplifying programming by removing mutable state is like "simplifying" a car by removing the dashboard: the finished product may be simpler, but good luck making it interact with end-users.Just about every user application I can think of involves state as a core concept.  If you write a document (or a SO post), the state changes with every new input.  Or if you play a video game, there are tons of state variables, beginning with the positions of all the characters, who tend to move around constantly.  How can you possibly do anything useful without keeping track of changing values?Every time I find something that discusses this issue, it\'s written in really technical functional-ese that assumes a heavy FP background that I don\'t have.  Does anyone know a way to explain this to someone with a good, solid understanding of imperative coding but who\'s a complete n00b on the functional side?EDIT:  A bunch of the replies so far seem to be trying to convince me of the advantages of immutable values.  I get that part.  It makes perfect sense.  What I don\'t understand is how you can keep track of values that have to change, and change constantly, without mutable variables.Or if you play a video game, there are\n  tons of state variables, beginning\n  with the positions of all the\n  characters, who tend to move around\n  constantly. How can you possibly do\n  anything useful without keeping track\n  of changing values?If you\'re interested, here\'s a series of articles which describe game programming with Erlang.You probably won\'t like this answer, but you won\'t get functional program until you use it. I can post code samples and say "Here, don\'t you see" -- but if you don\'t understand the syntax and underlying principles, then your eyes just glaze over. From your point of view, it looks as if I\'m doing the same thing as an imperative language, but just setting up all kinds of boundaries to purposefully make programming more difficult. My point of view, you\'re just experiencing the Blub paradox.I was skeptical at first, but I jumped on the functional programming train a few years ago and fell in love with it. The trick with functional programming is being able to recognize patterns, particular variable assignments, and move the imperative state to the stack. A for-loop, for example, becomes recursion:Its not very pretty, but we got the same effect with no mutation. Of course, wherever possible, we like avoid looping altogether and just abstract it away:The Seq.iter method will enumerate through the collection and invoke the anonymous function for each item. Very handy :)I know, printing numbers isn\'t exactly impressive. However, we can use the same approach with games: hold all state in the stack and create a new object with our changes in the recursive call. In this way, each frame is a stateless snapshot of the game, where each frame simply creates a brand new object with the desired changes of whatever stateless objects needs updating. The pseudocode for this might be:The imperative and functional versions are identical, but the functional version clearly uses no mutable state. The functional code keeps all state is held on the stack -- the nice thing about this approach is that, if something goes wrong, debugging is easy, all you need is a stack trace.This scales up to any number of objects in the game, because all objects (or collections of related objects) can be rendered in their own thread.Just about every user application I\n  can think of involves state as a core\n  concept.In functional languages, rather than mutating the state of objects, we simply return a new object with the changes we want. Its more efficient than it sounds. Data structures, for example, are very easy to represent as immutable data structures. Stacks, for example, are notoriously easy to implement:The code above constructs two immutable lists, appends them together to make a new list, and appends the results. No mutable state is used anywhere in the application. It looks a little bulky, but that\'s only because C# is a verbose language. Here\'s the equivalent program in F#:No mutable necessary to create and manipulate lists. Nearly all data structures can be easily converted into their functional equivalents. I wrote a page here which provides immutable implementations of stacks, queues, leftist heaps, red-black trees, lazy lists. Not a single snippet of code contains any mutable state. To "mutate" a tree, I create a brand new one with new node I want -- this is very efficient because I don\'t need to make a copy of every node in the tree, I can reuse the old ones in my new tree.Using a more significant example, I also wrote this SQL parser which is totally stateless (or at least my code is stateless, I don\'t know whether the underlying lexing library is stateless).Stateless programming is just as expressive and powerful as stateful programming, it just requires a little practice to train yourself to start thinking statelessly. Of course, "stateless programming when possible, stateful programming where necessary" seems to be the motto of most impure functional languages. There\'s no harm in falling back on mutables when the functional approach just isn\'t as clean or efficient.Short answer: you can\'t.So what\'s the fuss about immutability then?If you\'re well-versed in imperative language, then you know that "globals are bad". Why? Because they introduce (or have the potential to introduce) some very hard-to-untangle dependencies in your code. And dependencies are not good; you want your code to be modular. Parts of program not influence other parts as little as possible. And FP brings you to the holy grail of modularity: no side effects at all. You just have your f(x) = y. Put x in, get y out. No changes to x or anything else. FP makes you stop thinking about state, and start thinking in terms of values. All of your functions simply receive values and produce new values. This has several advantages. First off, no side-effects means simpler programs, easier to reason about. No worrying that introducing a new part of program is going to interfere and crash an existing, working part.Second, this makes program trivially parallelizable (efficient parallelization is another matter).Third, there are some possible performance advantages. Say you have a function:Now you put in a value of 3 in, and you get a value of 6 out. Every time. But you can do that in imperative as well, right? Yep. But the problem is that in imperative, you can do even more. I can do:but I could also do The imperative compiler doesn\'t know whether I\'m going to have side effects or not, which makes it more difficult to optimize (i.e. double 2 needn\'t be 4 every time). The functional one knows I won\'t - hence, it can optimize every time it sees "double 2".Now, even though creating new values every time seems incredibly wasteful for complex types of values in terms of computer memory, it doesn\'t have to be so. Because, if you have f(x) = y, and values x and y are "mostly the same" (e.g. trees which differ only in a few leafs) then x and y can share parts of memory - because neither of them will mutate.So if this unmutable thing is so great, why did I answer that you can\'t do anything useful without mutable state. Well, without mutability, your entire program would be a giant f(x) = y function. And the same would go for all parts of your program: just functions, and functions in the "pure" sense at that. As I said, this means f(x) = y every time. So e.g. readFile("myFile.txt") would need to return the same string value every time. Not too useful.Therefore, every FP provides some means of mutating state. "Pure" functional languages (e.g. Haskell) do this using somewhat scary concepts such as monads, while "impure" ones (e.g. ML) allow this directly.And of course, functional languages come with a host of other goodies which make programming more efficient, such as first-class functions etc.Note that saying functional programming does not have \'state\' is a little misleading and might be the cause of the confusion. It definitely has no \'mutable state\', but it can still have values that are manipulated; they just cannot be changed in-place (e.g. you have to create new values from the old values).This is a gross over-simplification, but imagine you had an OO language, where all the properties on classes are set once only in the constructor, all methods are static functions. You could still perform pretty much any calculation by having methods take objects containing all the values they needs for their calculations and then returning new objects with the result (maybe a new instance of the same object even).It may be \'hard\' to translate existing code into this paradigm, but that is because it really requires a completely different way of thinking about code. As a side-effect though in most cases you get a lot of opportunity for parallelism for free.Addendum: (Regarding your edit of how to keep track of values that need to change)\nThey would be stored in an immutable data structure of course...This is not a suggested \'solution\', but the easiest way to see that this will always work is that you could store these immutable values into a map (dictionary / hashtable) like structure, keyed by a \'variable name\'.Obviously in practical solutions you\'d use a more sane approach, but this does show that worst-case if nothing else\'d work you could \'simulate\' mutable state with such a map that you carry around through your invocation tree.Here\'s how you write code without mutable state: instead of putting changing state into mutable variables, you put it into the parameters of functions.  And instead of writing loops, you write recursive functions.  So for example this imperative code:becomes this functional code (Scheme-like syntax):or this Haskellish codeAs to why functional programmers like to do this (which you did not ask), the more pieces of your program are stateless, the more ways there are to put pieces together without having anything break.  The power of the stateless paradigm lies not in statelessness (or purity) per se, but the ability it gives you to write powerful, reusable functions and combine them.You can find a good tutorial with lots of examples in John Hughes\'s paper Why Functional Programming Matters.It\'s just different ways of doing the same thing.Consider a simple example such as adding the numbers 3, 5, and 10. Imagine thinking about doing that by first changing the value of 3 by adding 5 to it, then adding 10 to that "3", then outputting the current value of "3" (18). This seems patently ridiculous, but it is in essence the way that state-based imperative programming is often done. Indeed, you can have many different "3"s that have the value 3, yet are different. All of this seems odd, because we have been so ingrained with the, quite enormously sensible, idea that the numbers are immutable.Now think about adding 3, 5, and 10 when you take the values to be immutable. You add 3 and 5 to produce another value, 8, then you add 10 to that value to produce yet another value, 18.These are equivalent ways to do the same thing. All of the necessary information exists in both methods, but in different forms. In one the information exists as state and in the rules for changing state. In the other the information exists in immutable data and functional definitions.I think there\'s a slight misunderstanding. Pure functional programs have state. The difference is how that state is modeled. In pure functional programming, state is manipulated by functions that take some state and return the next state. Sequencing through states is then achieved by passing the state through a sequence of pure functions.Even global mutable state can be modeled this way. In Haskell, for example, a program is a function from a World to a World. That is, you pass in the entire universe, and the program returns a new universe. In practise, though, you only need to pass in the parts of the universe in which your program is actually interested. And programs actually return a sequence of actions that serve as instructions for the operating environment in which the program runs.You wanted to see this explained in terms of imperative programming. OK, let\'s look at some really simple imperative programming in a functional language.Consider this code:Pretty bog-standard imperative code. Doesn\'t do anything interesting, but that\'s OK for illustration. I think you will agree that there\'s state involved here. The value of the x variable changes over time. Now, let\'s change the notation slightly by inventing a new syntax:Put parentheses to make it clearer what this means: So you see, state is modeled by a sequence of pure expressions that bind the free variables of the following expressions.You will find that this pattern can model any kind of state, even IO.Functional programming avoids state and emphasizes functionality.  There\'s never any such thing as no state, though the state might actually be something that\'s immutable or baked into the architecture of what you\'re working with.  Consider the difference between a static web server that just loads up files off the filesystem versus a program that implements a Rubik\'s cube.  The former is going to be implemented in terms of functions designed to turn a request into a file path request into a response from the contents of that file.  Virtually no state is needed beyond a tiny bit of configuration (the filesystem \'state\' is really outside the scope of the program.  The program works the same way regardless of what state the files are in).  In the latter though, you need to model the cube and your program implementation of how operations on that cube change its state.In addition to the great answers others are giving, think about the classes Integer and String in Java.  Instances of these classes are immutable, but that doesn\'t make the classes useless just because their instances cannot be changed.  The immutability gives you some safety.  You know if you use a String or Integer instance as the key to a Map, the key cannot be changed.  Compare this to the Date class in Java:You have silently changed a key in your map!  Working with immutable objects, such as in Functional Programming, is a lot cleaner.  It\'s easier to reason about what side effects occur -- none!  This means it\'s easier for the programmer, and also easier for the optimizer.It is in fact quite easy to have something which looks like mutable state even in languages without mutable state.Consider a function with type s -> (a, s). Translating from Haskell syntax, it means a function which takes one parameter of type "s" and returns a pair of values, of types "a" and "s". If s is the type of our state, this function takes one state and returns a new state, and possibly a value (you can always return "unit" aka (), which is sort of equivalent to "void" in C/C++, as the "a" type). If you chain several calls of functions with types like this (getting the state returned from one function and passing it to the next), you have "mutable" state (in fact you are in each function creating a new state and abandoning the old one).It might be easier to understand if you imagine the mutable state as the "space" where your program is executing, and then think of the time dimension. At instant t1, the "space" is in a certain condition (say for example some memory location has value 5). At a later instant t2, it is in a different condition (for example that memory location now has value 10). Each of these time "slices" is a state, and it is immutable (you cannot go back in time to change them). So, from this point of view, you went from the full spacetime with a time arrow (your mutable state) to a set of slices of spacetime (several immutable states), and your program is just treating each slice as a value and computing each of them as a function applied to the previous one.OK, maybe that was not easier to understand :-)It might seem inneficient to explicitly represent the whole program state as a value, which has to be created only to be discarded the next instant (just after a new one is created). For some algorithms it might be natural, but when it is not, there is another trick. Instead of a real state, you can use a fake state which is nothing more than a marker (let\'s call the type of this fake state State#). This fake state exists from the point of view of the language, and is passed like any other value, but the compiler completely omits it when generating the machine code. It only serves to mark the sequence of execution.As an example, suppose the compiler gives us the following functions:Translating from these Haskell-like declarations, readRef receives something which resembles a pointer or a handle to a value of type "a", and the fake state, and returns the value of type "a" pointed to by the first parameter and a new fake state. writeRef is similar, but changes the value pointed to instead.If you call readRef and then pass it the fake state returned by writeRef (perhaps with other calls to unrelated functions in the middle; these state values create a "chain" of function calls), it will return the value written. You can call writeRef again with the same pointer/handle and it will write to the same memory location — but, since conceptually it is returning a new (fake) state, the (fake) state is still imutable (a new one has been "created"). The compiler will call the functions in the order it would have to call them if there was a real state variable which had to be computed, but the only state which there is is the full (mutable) state of the real hardware.(Those who know Haskell will notice I simplified things a lot and ommited several important details. For those who want to see more details, take a look at Control.Monad.State from the mtl, and at the ST s and IO (aka ST RealWorld) monads.)You might wonder why doing it in such a roundabout way (instead of simply having mutable state in the language). The real advantage is that you have reified your program\'s state. What before was implicit (your program state was global, allowing for things like action at a distance) is now explicit. Functions which do not receive and return the state cannot modify it or be influenced by it; they are "pure". Even better, you can have separate state threads, and with a bit of type magic, they can be used to embed an imperative computation within a pure one, without making it impure (the ST monad in Haskell is the one normally used for this trick; the State# I mentioned above is in fact GHC\'s State# s, used by its implementation of the ST and IO monads).I\'m late to the discussion, but I wanted to add a few points for people who are struggling with functional programming.First the imperative way (in pseudocode)Now the functional way (in pseudocode). I\'m leaning heavily on the ternary operator because I want people from imperative backgrounds to actually be able to read this code. So if you don\'t use the ternary operator much (I always avoided it in my imperative days) here is how it works.You can chain the ternary expression by putting a new ternary expression in place of the false-expressionSo with that in mind, here\'s the functional version.This is a trivial example. If this were moving people around in a game world, you\'d have to introduce side effects like drawing the object\'s current position on the screen and introducing a bit of delay in each call based on how fast the object moves. But you still wouldn\'t need mutable state.The lesson is that functional languages "mutate" state by calling the function with different parameters. Obviously this doesn\'t really mutate any variables, but that\'s how you get a similar effect. This means you\'ll have to get used to thinking recursively if you want to do functional programming.Learning to think recursively is not hard, but it does take both practice and a toolkit. That small section in that "Learn Java" book where they used recursion to calculate factorial does not cut it. You need a toolkit of skills like making iterative processes out of recursion (this is why tail recursion is essential for functional language), continuations, invariants, etc. You wouldn\'t do OO programming without learning about access modifiers, interfaces etc. Same thing for functional programming.My recommendation is to do the Little Schemer (note that I say "do" and not "read") and then do all the exercises in SICP. When you\'re done, you\'ll have a different brain than when you started.Using some creativity and pattern matching, stateless games have been created:as well as rolling demos:and visualizations:That\'s the way FORTRAN would work without COMMON blocks: You\'d write methods that had the values you passed in and local variables. That\'s it.Object oriented programming brought us state and behavior together, but it was a new idea when I first encountered it from C++ back in 1994.  Geez, I was a functional programmer when I was a mechanical engineer and I didn\'t know it!For highly interactive applications such as games, Functional Reactive Programming is your friend: if you can formulate the properties of your game\'s world as time-varying values (and/or event streams), you are ready! These formulae will be sometimes even more natural and intent-revealing than mutating a state, e.g. for a moving ball, you can directly use the well-known law x = v * t. And what\'s better, the game\'s rules written such way compose better than object-oriented abstractions. For example, in this case, the ball\'s speed can be also a time-varying value, which depends on the event stream consisting of the ball\'s collisions. For more concrete design considerations, see Making Games in Elm.Bear in mind:  functional languages are Turing complete.  Therefore, any useful task you would perform in an imperitive language can be done in a functional language.  At the end of the day though, I think there\'s something to be said of a hybrid approach.  Languages like F# and Clojure (and I\'m sure others) encourage stateless design, but allow for mutability when necessary.You can\'t have a pure functional language that is useful. There will always be a level of mutability that you have to deal with, IO is one example.Think of functional languages as just another tool that you use. Its good for certain things, but not others. The game example you gave might not be the best way to use a functional language, at least the screen will have a mutable state that you can\'t do anything about with FP. The way you think of problem and the type of problems you solve with FP will be different from ones you are used to with imperative programming.By using lots of recursion.Tic Tac Toe in F# (A functional language.)This is very simple.  You can use as many variables as you want in functional programming...but only if they\'re local variables (contained inside functions).  So just wrap your code in functions, pass values back and forth among those functions (as passed parameters and returned values)...and that\'s all there is to it!Here\'s an example:
