I am trying to run a hello world program written in javascript in a separate file named hello.jsCurrently running windows version of node.js.The code runs perfectly in console window but how do I reference the path in windows environment.in Unix I guess it is showing $ node hello.jsI\'m absolutely new to Node.js Please correct me if I am doing something wrong.I tried > node  C:\\abc\\zyx\\hello.js ----didn\'t work> C:\\abc\\zyx\\hello.js --didn\'t workUPDATE1:Added node.exe to the folder where hello.js file is sitting.\nAdded path point to the folder c:\\abc\\zyx\\  and I get an error that says ReferenceError: hello is not definedsee contents of hello.js UPDATE 2:So far I have tried all these version and none of them seems to work.  May be I am doing something completely wrong.Refer to my file structureRESOLVED:\nInstead of running node.exe, try running in command prompt with the following option and it worked.Here are the exact steps I just took to run the "Hello World" example found at http://nodejs.org/. This is a quick and dirty example. For a permanent installation you\'d want to store the executable in a more reasonable place than the root directory and update your PATH to include its location.C:>node hello.jsThat\'s it. This was done on Windows XP.You need to make sure that node is in your PATH. To set up your path, this out: http://geekswithblogs.net/renso/archive/2009/10/21/how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx.Make sure that the directory that has node.exe is in your PATH. Then you should be able to \nrun node path_to_js_file.js.For a good "Hello World" example, check out: http://howtonode.org/hello-nodeInstall the MSI file:\nGo to the installed directory C:\\Program Files\\nodejs from command prompt n C:\\>cd C:\\Program Files\\nodejs enter..node helloworld.jsoutput:Hello Worldanother simple way I installed node for windows.\nThere is a node.js command prompt when I search for node.js in windows 7 start menu\nIf you run this special command prompt, you can node anything in any location without setting up the path or copy node.exe everywhere.%CD% captures the current directory under DOSWinXp: \nI have created a .bat fileThat just run  my_program.bat from Explorer or in cmd windowtype node js command prompt in start screen. and use it.\nOR \nset PATH of node in environment variable.For all stuck on how to start!https://github.com/sethvincent/javascriptingCopy here incase link dies:All you have to do is right click the .js file on Windows and press "Open with Command Prompt"\nOR\nOpen cmd, copy the path to the folder containing your script, and run the command "cd [paste text here]". Then do "node example.js"
