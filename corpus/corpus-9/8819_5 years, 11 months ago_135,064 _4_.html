Possible Duplicate:\n  Get Information about a SHA-1 commit object? I needed to check when a specific change was added to a file I\'m working on, so I used the git blame command. From that I obtained the hash of the relevant commit. Is there a way to see the log notes of just that commit, using the hash? All the docs talk about how to look at the whole tree.I realize could just do git log <filename>, but there are a lot of commits for the file, and I\'m loathe to go through all of them looking for this one. A simple way to view the log notes would be appreciated.Documentation here.\nOr if that doesn\'t work, try Google Code\'s GIT Documentation
