Is there a file or menu that will let me change the settings on how to deal with line endings?There are 3 options:Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-styleGit will convert LF to CRLF when checking out text files. When\ncommitting text files, CRLF will be converted to LF. For\ncross-platform projects, this is the recommended setting on Windows\n("core.autocrlf" is set to "true")Checkout as-is, commit Unix-styleGit will not perform any conversion when checking out text files.\nWhen committing text files, CRLF will be converted to LF. For\ncross-platform projects this is the recommended setting on Unix\n("core.autocrlf" is set to "input").Checkout as-is, commit as-isGit will not perform any conversions when checking out or committing\ntext files. Choosing this option is not recommended for cross-platform\nprojects ("core.autocrlf" is set to "false")The normal way to control this is with git configFor examplegit config --global core.autocrlf trueFor details, scroll down in this link to Pro Git to the section named "core.autocrlf"If you want to know what file this is saved in, you can run the command:git config --global --editand the git global config file should open in a text editor, and you can see where that file was loaded from.Line ending format used in OSWe can configure git to auto-correct line ending formats for each OS in two ways.This will fix any CRLF to LF when you commit.This will make sure when you checkout in windows, all LF will convert to CRLFIt is a good idea to keep a .gitattributes file as we don\'t want to expect everyone in our team set their config. This file should keep in repo\'s root path and if exist one, git will respect it.This will treat all files as text files and convert to OS\'s line ending on checkout and back to LF on commit automatically. If wanted to tell explicitly, then useFirst one is for checkout and second one is for commit.Treat all .jpg images as binary files. So no conversion needed For a repository setting solution, that can be redistributed to all developers, check out the text attribute in the .gitattributes file. This way, developers dont have to manually set their own line endings on the repository, and because different repositories can have different line ending styles, global core.autocrlf is not the best, at least in my opinion. For example unsetting this attribute on a given path [. - text] will force git not to touch line endings when checking in and checking out. In my opinion, this is the best behavior, as most modern text editors can handle both type of line endings. Also, if you as a developer still want to do line ending conversion when checking in, you can still set the path to match certain files or set the eol attribute (in .gitattributes) on your repository.Also check out this related post, which describes .gitattributes file and text attribute in more detail: What's the best CRLF (carriage return, line feed) handling strategy with Git?If you want to convert back the file formats which have been changed to UNIX Format from PC format.(1)You need to reinstall tortoise GIT and in the "Line Ending Conversion" Section make sure that you have selected "Check out as is - Check in as is"option.(2)and keep the remaining configurations as it is.(3)once installation is done(4)write all the file extensions which are converted to UNIX format into a text file (extensions.txt).(5) copy the file into your clone\nRun the following command in GITBASH
