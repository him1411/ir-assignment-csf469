I can\'t figure it out how to get the class value of the clicked element.When I use the code bellow, I get "node-205" every time.Here\'s a quick jQuery example that adds a click event to each "li" tag, and then retrieves the class attribute for the clicked element. Hope it helps.Equally, you don\'t have to wrap the object in jQuery:And in newer browsers you can get the full list of class names:You can emulate classList in older browsers using myClass.split(/\\s+/);This should do the trick:For more info about the ui.tab see http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#EventsI saw this question so I thought I might expand on it a little more. This is an expansion of the idea that @SteveFenton had. Instead of binding a click event to each li element, it would be more efficient to delegate the events from the ul down.For jQuery 1.7 and higherDocumentation: .on()For jQuery 1.4.2 - 1.7Documentation: .delegate()As a last resort for jQuery 1.3 - 1.4orDocumentation: .live()
