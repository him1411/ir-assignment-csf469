I\'m trying to retrieve a file from a server using SFTP (as opposed to FTPS) using Java. How can I do this?Another option is to consider looking at the JSch library. JSch seems to be the preferred library for a few large open source projects, including Eclipse, Ant and Apache Commons HttpClient, amongst others.It supports both user/pass and certificate-based logins nicely, as well as all a whole host  of other yummy SSH2 features.Here\'s a simple remote file retrieve over SFTP. Error handling is left as an exercise for the reader :-)Here is the complete source code of an example using JSch without having to worry about the ssh key checking.Below is an example using Apache Common VFS:This was the solution I came up with\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/sshtools/ (most error handling omitted for clarity). This is an excerpt from my blogA nice abstraction on top of Jsch is Apache commons-vfs which offers a virtual filesystem API that makes accessing and writing SFTP files almost transparent. Worked well for us.Apache Commons SFTP libraryCommon java properties file for all the examplesserverAddress=111.222.333.444userId=myUserIdpassword=myPasswordremoteDirectory=products/   localDirectory=import/Upload file to remote server using SFTPDownload file from remote server using SFTPDelete a file on remote server using SFTPThere is a nice comparison of the 3 mature Java libraries for SFTP: Commons VFS, SSHJ and JSch To sum up SSHJ has the clearest API and it\'s the best out of them if you don\'t need other storages support provided by Commons VFS.Here is edited SSHJ example from github:hierynomus/sshj has a complete implementation of SFTP version 3 (what OpenSSH implements)Example code from SFTPUpload.javaAndy, to delete file on remote system you need to use (channelExec) of JSch and pass unix/linux commands to delete it.Try edtFTPj/PRO, a mature, robust SFTP client library that supports connection pools and asynchronous operations. Also supports FTP and FTPS so all bases for secure file transfer are covered.I found complete working example for SFTP in java using JSCH API \nhttp://kodehelp.com/java-program-for-uploading-file-to-sftp-server/Though answers above were very helpful, I\'ve spent a day to make them work, facing various exceptions like "broken channel", "rsa key unknown" and "packet corrupt".Below is a working reusable class for SFTP FILES UPLOAD/DOWNLOAD using JSch library.Upload usage:Download usage:The class code:You also have JFileUpload with SFTP add-on (Java too):\nhttp://www.jfileupload.com/products/sftp/index.htmlI use this SFTP API called Zehon, it\'s great, so easy to use with a lot of sample code. Here is the site http://www.zehon.comThe best solution I\'ve found is Paramiko. There\'s a Java version.
