I am trying to display HTML inside a bootstrap popover, but somehow it\'s not working. I found some answers here but it won\'t work for me. Please let me know if I\'m doing something wrong.You cant use <li href="#" since it belongs to <a href="#" that\'s why it wasn\'t working, change it and it\'s all good. Here is working JSFiddle which shows you how to create bootstrap popover.Relevant parts of the code is below:HTML:JavaScript:And btw, you always need at least $("[data-toggle=popover]").popover(); to enable the popover. But in place of data-toggle="popover" you can also use id="my-popover" or class="my-popover". Just remember to enable them using e.g: $("#my-popover").popover(); in those cases.Here is the link to the complete spec:\nBootstrap PopoverBonus:If for some reason you dont like (or cant) read content of a popup from the data-toggle and title tags. You can also use e.g. hidden divs and a bit more JavaScript. Here is an example about that. Cheers. you can use attribute data-html="true": You need to create a popover instance that has the html option enabled (place this in your javascript file after the popover JS code):$(\'.popover-with-html\').popover({ html : true });Another way to specify the popover content in a reusable way is to create a new data attribute like data-popover-content and use it like this:HTML:JS:This can be useful when you have a lot of html to place into your popovers.Here is an example fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/z824fn6b/I used a pop over inside a list, Im giving an example via HTMLThis is a slight modification on Jack\'s excellent answer.The following makes sure simple popovers, without HTML content, remain unaffected.JavaScript:I really hate to put long HTML inside of the attribute, here is my solution, clear and simple (replace ? with whatever you want):thenThis is an old question, but this is another way, using jQuery to reuse the popover and to keep using the original bootstrap data attributes to make it more semantic:Fiddle with complete example:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/tomsarduy/262w45L5/You can change the \'template/popover/popover.html\' in file \'ui-bootstrap-tpls-0.11.0.js\'\nWrite: "bind-html-unsafe" instead of "ng-bind"It will show all popover with html.\n*its unsafe html. Use only if you trust the html.
