I query a model, and it returns sayWhat i want is, to know the best Django way to fire\na group_by query to my db, as like,Which doesn\'t work of course.\nI know we can do some tricks on "django/db/models/query.py", \nbut i am just curious to know how to do it without patching.If you mean to do aggregation you can use the aggregation features of the ORM:This results in a query similar toand the output would be of the formAn easy solution, but not in a proper way is to use RAW-SQL:http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/sql/#topics-db-sqlAnother solution is to use the group_by property:You can now iterate over the results variable to retrieve your results. Note that group_by is not documented and may be changed in future version of Django.And... why do you want to use group_by? If you don\'t use aggregation, you can use order_by to achieve an alike result.You need to do custom SQL as exemplified in this snippet:Custom SQL via subqueryOr in a custom manager as shown in the online Django docs:Adding extra Manager methodsDjango does not support free group by queries. I learned it in the very bad way. ORM is not designed to support stuff like what you want to do, without using custom SQL. You are limited to:Over a queryset qs you can call qs.query.group_by = [\'field1\', \'field2\', ...] but it is risky if you don\'t know what query are you editing and have no guarantee that it will work and not break internals of the QuerySet object. Besides, it is an internal (undocumented) API you should not access directly without risking the code not being anymore compatible with future Django versions.There is module that allows you to group Django models and still work with a QuerySet in the result: https://github.com/kako-nawao/django-group-byFor example:\'book/books.html\'The difference to the annotate/aggregate basic Django queries is the use of the attributes of a related field, e.g. book.author.last_name.If you need the PKs of the instances that have been grouped together, add the following annotation:NOTE: ArrayAgg is a Postgres specific function, available from Django 1.9 onwards: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/postgres/aggregates/#arrayagg If I\'m not mistaking you can use, whatever-query-set.group_by=[\'field\']
