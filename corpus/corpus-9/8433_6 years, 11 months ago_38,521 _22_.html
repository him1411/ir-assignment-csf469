I\'m using argparse in Python 2.7 for parsing input options. One of my options is a multiple choice. I want to make a list in its help text, e.g.However, argparse strips all newlines and consecutive spaces. The result looks likeHow to insert newlines in the help text?Try using RawTextHelpFormatter:If you just want to override the one option, you should not use RawTextHelpFormatter. Instead subclass the HelpFormatter and provide a special intro for the options that should be handled "raw" (I use "R|rest of help"):And use it:Any other calls to .add_argument() where the help does not start with R| will be wrapped as normal.This is part of my improvements on argparse. The full SmartFormatter also supports adding\nthe defaults to all options, and raw input of the utilities description. The full version\nhas its own _split_lines method, so that any formatting done to e.g. version strings is preserved:Another easy way to do it is to include textwrap.For example,In this way, we can avoid the long empty space in front of each output line.I\'ve faced similar issue (Python 2.7.6). I\'ve tried to break down description section into several lines using RawTextHelpFormatter:And got:So RawTextHelpFormatter is not a solution. Because it prints description as it appears in source code, preserving all whitespace characters (I want to keep extra tabs in my source code for readability but I don\'t want to print them all. Also raw formatter doesn\'t wrap line when it is too long, more than 80 characters for example).Thanks to @Anton who inspired the right direction above. But that solution needs slight modification in order to format description section.Anyway, custom formatter is needed. I extended existing HelpFormatter class and overrode _fill_text method like this:Compare with the original source code coming from argparse module:In the original code the whole description is being wrapped. In custom formatter above the whole text is split into several chunks, and each of them is formatted independently.So with aid of custom formatter:the output is:I wanted to have both manual line breaks in the description text, and auto wrapping of it; but none of the suggestions here worked for me - so I ended up modifying the SmartFormatter class given in the answers here; the issues with the argparse method names not being a public API notwithstanding, here is what I have (as a file called test.py):This is how it works in 2.7 and 3.4:
