I want to  be able to change the background color to white in my android app in the simplest way possible. You need to use the  android:background property , egAlso you need to add a value for white in the strings.xmlEdit : 18th Nov 2012The first two letters of an 8 letter color code provide the alpha value, if you are using the html 6 letter color notation the color is opaque.Eg : You can also usein your xml layout or /res/layout/activity_main.xml, or you can change the theme in your AndroidManifest.xml by adding  to your activity tag.If you want to change the background dynamically, useandroid:background="@android:color/white"No need to define anything. It uses predefined colors in android.R.To change the background color in the simplest way possible programmatically (exclusively - no XML changes):Only requirement is that your "base" element in the activity_whatever.xml has an id which you can reference in Java (container in this case):Paschalis and James, who replied here, kind of lead me to this solution, after checking out the various possibilities in How to set the text color of TextView in code?.Hope it helps someone!The simplest way is to add android:background="#FFFFFF" to the main node in the layout.xml or /res/layout/activity_main.xml:This method worked for me:Set id in layout xmlAdd color values/color.xmlYou can try this in xml sheet:you can try with this way Another way, go to layout -> your .xml file -> design view .Then go component tree and select layout you want to change color . In below component tree there is properties section .Select background in the properties section (In picture section 1).  Then click section 2 in picture . Then Resources  window will be open .From that select color menu .Then choose color you want .enter image description hereIn Layout,to change background use this.In Program can be use this. For eg: Texview background color   You can use simple color resources, specified usually inside useand use this via android:background="@color/red". This color can be used anywhere else too, e.g. as a text color. Reference it in XML the same way, or get it in code via You can also use any drawable resource as a background, use android:background="@drawable/mydrawable" for this (that means 9patch drawables, normal bitmaps, shape drawables, ..).Some times , the text has the same color that background, try with android:background="#CCCCCC" into listview properties and you will can see that. android:background="#64B5F6"\n\nYou can change the value after \'#\' according to your own specification or need depending on how you want to use them. \nHere is a sample code:Thank you :) write this code up:The best way using background with gradient as it does not increase app size of your app images are poison for android app so try to use it less instead of using one color as a background you can use multiple colors in one background.\n\n
