When I try to run my application with in-app billing I am getting the error: "This version of the application is not configured for billing through Google Play. Check the help center for more information".I have the billing permission already in the Manifest file and I have a signed .apk uploaded as a draft onto Google Play and I have also installed that same signed apk onto my phone.Any help on how to solve this issue?This error may be caused by several reasons.  Here is the list of requirements for the Google IAB testing.Prerequisites:Testing requirements:P.S: Debugging with release certificate: https://stackoverflow.com/a/15754187/1321401 (Thnx @dipp for the link)P.P.S: Wanted to make this list for a long time already.Thnx @zlgdev, @Kyone for updatesAhh found the solution after trying for a couple of hours.The same will happen if your published version is not the same as the version you\'re testing on your phone. For example, uploaded version is android:versionCode="1", and the version you\'re testing on your phone is android:versionCode="2"You need to sign your APK with your live certificate. Then install that onto your test device. You can then test InAppBilling. If you are testing your application by direct run via eclipse to device(In debug mode) then you will get this error.If you are using android.test.purchased as the SKU, it will work all the way, but you won\'t have the developerPayload in your final response.If you are using your own draft in app item you can test all the way but you will be charged and so will have to refund it yourself afterwards.You cannot buy items with the same gmail account that you use for the google play development console.Let me just add what happened with me, may help some one.It was mainly due to signing.Since I have added the signing details in the Project structure, I was thinking that every time when I run, expected signed apk is getting installed. But build type \'debug\' was selected.Below fix solved the problem for me.This will happen if you use a different version of the apk than the one in the google play.In my case I saw the same message due to the different signatures of the installed apk and an uploaded to the market apk.Contrary to many answers and comments on SO and other sites, you do NOT have to perform preliminary tests with an alpha/beta version of your product that has been downloaded from Google Play onto your test device (the alpha/beta publication process often eats up half a day).  Neither do you have to load and re-load a signed release apk from your developer studio to your test device.You CAN debug preliminary Google Play in app billing services using the debug app as loaded from your developer studio directly to your test device via ADB.  If you are experiencing errors that prevent this, likely you have done something wrong in your code.  Pay especially close attention to the CASE of your SKU\'s (product ids) and their format (for example, if you load your APK as com.mydomain.my_product_id, be sure your try to purchase it this way - providing the same case and domain).  Also, pay especially close attention to your itemType - this should be either "inapp" or "subs" for managed/unmanaged in app purchases or subscriptions, respectively.As suggested by Chirag Patel, provided you have your billing code properly established, perform all testing using the android.test.purchased Sku (product ID) during your preliminary tests.  Check for this ID throughout your billing operations to pass it through signature, token and payload checks, since this data is not provided by the Google test system.  Additionally, give one of your test products this ID to test its purchase, unlock/load and presentation all the way through your schema.  To CLEAR the purchase, simply consume it, passing the same Sku AND a token string formatted this way - no other fields are relevant :Once you have completed this phase of testing, move to semi-live testing with your alpha/beta product.  Create a Google group (essentially a mailing list), add your test users emails to it, and add/invite this group to test your device in this phase (performed at the "APK" portion of your app\'s Google developer listing).  Purchases will be simulated but not actually charged - however to clear and re-test the purchases, Google indicates that you must refund them from your Google wallet.  THIS is the only phase of testing that requires the time-consuming process of using alpha/beta loads and test users.Had the same problem, and it was not solved before i read the post from DZDomi. It suddenly occurred to be that there is a setting in the Google Developer Console  that you need to enable. In the "In app purchases" section, there\'s a line for your product and to the far right there\'s a status for it. It should be ACTIVE!my problem was that i tried to check it with the debug.keystore , i mean running it through eclipse.I exported it with the keystore with which i published in alpha mode(it must be published before you can test it).installed it in my phone and than i could test it normally.If you want to debug IAB what do you have to do is:Submit to google play a version of your app with the IAB permission on the manifest:Add a product to your app on google play: Administering In-app BillingSet a custom debug keystore signed: Configure Eclipse to use signed keystoreThe problem also occurs, when you have added an in-app purchase after you uploaded the apk, but you have not published the application in the play store (alpha, beta and production). Which basically means, that you have to add the In-App purchase AFTER you have published the apk in the Play store (alpha, beta and production). Otherwise you wont be able to purchase or query for the In-App purchase.
