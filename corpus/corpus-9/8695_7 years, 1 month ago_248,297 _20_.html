I\'m trying to pass some parameter to a function used as callback, how can I do that?If you want something slightly more general, you can use the arguments variable like so:But otherwise, your example works fine (arguments[0] can be used in place of callback in the tester)This would also work:Another Scenario :Your question is unclear.  If you\'re asking how you can do this in a simpler way, you should take a look at the ECMAScript 5th edition method .bind(), which is a member of Function.prototype.  Using it, you can do something like this:You can also use the following code, which adds the method if it isn\'t available in the current browser:Examplebind() - PrototypeJS Documentation When you have a callback that will be called by something other than your code with a specific number of params and you want to pass in additional params you can pass a wrapper function as the callback and inside the wrapper pass the additional param(s). Wrap the \'child\' function(s) being passed as/with arguments within function wrappers to prevent them being evaluated when the \'parent\' function is called.Code from a question with any number of parameters and a callback context:Use curried function as in this simple example.A new version for the scenario where the callback will be called by some other function, not your own code, and you want to add additional parameters.For example, let\'s pretend that you have a lot of nested calls with success and error callbacks. I will use angular promises for this example but any javascript code with callbacks would be the same for the purpose.Now you may want to unclutter your code by defining a function to log errors, keeping the origin of the error for debugging purposes. This is how you would proceed to refactor your code:The calling function will still add the error parameter after your callback function parameters.I was looking for the same thing and end up with the solution and here it\'s a simple example if anybody wants to go through this.Also posted on the other question here
