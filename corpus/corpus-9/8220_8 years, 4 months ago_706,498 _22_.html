I have a form with two text boxes, one select drop down and one radio button. When the enter key is pressed, I want to call a javascript function (User defined), but when I press it, the form is submitted. How do I prevent the form from being submitted when the enter key is pressed?Ok, so imagine you have the following textbox in a form:In order to run some "user defined" script from this text box when the enter key is pressed, and not have it submit the form, here is some sample code. Please note that this function doesn\'t do any error checking and most likely will only work in IE. To do this right you need a more robust solution, but you will get the general idea.returning the value of the function will alert the event handler not to bubble the event any further, and will prevent the keypress event from being handled further.Use both event.which and event.keyCode:If you\'re using jQuery:Override the onsubmit action of the form to be a call to your function and add return false after it, ie:Detect Enter key pressed on whole document:http://jsfiddle.net/umerqureshi/dcjsa08n/3/A react js solutionA jQuery solution.I came here looking for a way to delay the form submission until after the blur event on the text input had been fired.Would be nice to get a more general version that fired all the delayed events rather than just the form submit.Below code will add listener for ENTER key on entire page.This can be very useful in screens with single Action button eg Login, Register, Submit etc.   Tested on all browsers.  A much simpler and effective way from my perspective should be : More recent and much cleaner: use event.key. No more arbitrary number codes!Mozilla DocsSupported Browsers
