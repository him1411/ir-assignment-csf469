This is a two part question:How can you position the modal vertically in the center when you don\'t know the exact height of the modal?Is it possible to have the modal centered and have overflow:auto in the modal-body, but only if the modal exceeds the screen height?I have tried using this:This gives me the result I need when the content is much larger than vertical screen size, but for small modal contents it\'s pretty much unusable.And adjust a little bit .fade class to make sure it appears out of the top border of window, instead of center1. How can you position the modal vertically in the center when you don\'t know the exact height of the modal?To absolute center the Bootstrap 3 Modal without declaring a height, you will first need to overwrite the Bootstrap CSS by adding this to your style sheet:This will position the modal-dialogs top-left corner in the center of the window.We have to add this media query or else the modal margin-left is wrong on small devices:Now we will need to adjust its position with JavaScript. To do that we give the element a negative top and left margin equal to half of its height and width. In this example we will be using jQuery since it is available with Bootstrap.Adding on Finik\'s answer. Credits to Centering in the Unknown.Notice the negative margin-right? This removes the space added by inline-block. That space causes the modal to jump to the bottom of the page @media width < 768px.2. Is it possible to have the modal centered and have overflow:auto in the modal-body, but only if the modal exceeds the screen height?\nThis is possible by giving the modal-body an overflow-y:auto and a max-height. This takes a bit more work to get it working properly. Start with adding this to your style sheet:We will use jQuery again to get the window height and set the max-height of the modal-content first. Then we have to set the max-height of the modal-body, by subtracting the modal-content with the modal-header and modal-footer:You can find a working demo here with Bootstrap 3.0.3: http://cdpn.io/GwvrJ\nEDIT: I recommend using the updated version instead for a more responsive solution: http://cdpn.io/mKfCc(Updated 30/11/2015 http://cdpn.io/mKfCc with above edit)My solutionIt can simply can be fixed with display: flexWith prefixIf you\'re okay with using flexbox then this should help solve it.All what I did in my case is to set the Top in my css knowing the height of the modal <div id="myModal" class="modal fade"> ... </div>in my css i setI came up with a pure css solution! It\'s css3 though, which means ie8 or lower is not supported, but other than this it\'s tested and working on ios, android, ie9+, chrome, firefox, desktop safari..I am using the following css:Here is a fiddle.\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/Hiskj..selecting this as the correct answer since there\'s no extra heavy javascript that brings the browser to its knees in case of more than one modals.There is an easiest way to do this using css:That\'s it. Notice that it is only needed to be applied to the .modal-dialog container div.Demo: https://jsfiddle.net/darioferrer/0ueu4dmy/The most universal solution I wrote. Dynamicaly computes with dialog height. (Next step could be recalculating of dialogs\' height on window resize.)JSfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/8Fvg9/3/Expanding on @Finik\'s excellent answer, this fix is only applied to non-mobile devices. I tested in IE8, Chrome, and Firefox 22 - it works with very long or short content.Found the perfect solution from herei have downloaded bootstrap3-dialog from bellow link and modified the open function in  bootstrap-dialog.js https://github.com/nakupanda/bootstrap3-dialog CodeCssHere\'s one other css only method that works pretty well and is based on this:\nhttp://zerosixthree.se/vertical-align-anything-with-just-3-lines-of-css/sass:Try something like this:You might want to check out this collection of methods for absolute centering a div: http://codepen.io/shshaw/full/gEiDtI know it\'s a bit late, but I am adding a new answer so that it doesn\'t get lost in the crowd. It\'s a cross-desktop-mobile-browser solution that works everywhere properly as it should.It just needs the modal-dialog to be wrapped inside a modal-dialog-wrap class and need to have the following code additions:The dialog starts centered and in cases of large content it simply grows vertically until a scrollbar appears.Here is a working fiddle for your pleasure!https://jsfiddle.net/v6u82mvu/1/Consider using the bootstrap-modal plugin found here - https://github.com/jschr/bootstrap-modalThe plugin will center all of your modalsFor the centering, I don\'t get what\'s with the overly complicated solutions. bootstrap already centers it horizontally for you, so you don\'t need to mess with this. My solution is just set a top margin only using jQuery.I\'ve used the loaded.bs.modal event as I am remotely loading content, and using the shown.ba.modal event causes the height calculation to be incorrect. You can of course add in an event for the window being resized if you need it to be that responsive.Very very easy way to achieve this concept and you will get modal always in the moddle of your screen by css as fllow : http://jsfiddle.net/jy0zc2jc/1/you have to just modal class display as table by following css:and modal-dialog as display:table-cellsee full working example in given fiddleit\'s not that complicated.please try this:A simple way. Work for me. Thks rensdenobel :)\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/rensdenobel/sRmLV/13/Use this simple script that centers the modals.If you want you can set a custom class (ex: .modal.modal-vcenter instead of .modal) to limit the functionality only to some modals.Also add this CSS fix for the modal\'s horizontal spacing; we show the scroll on the modals, the body scrolls is hidden automatically by Bootstrap:yet another solution which will set a valid position for each visible modal on window.resize event and on show.bs.modal:In mobile plantform it might look a little different, here\'s my code.This works for me:My solution:Table style
