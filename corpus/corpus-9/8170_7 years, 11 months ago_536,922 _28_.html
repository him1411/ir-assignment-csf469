I am working on a Windows 2003 server (64-bit) with 8 GB RAM. How can I increase the heap memory maximum? I am using the -Xmx1500m flag to increase the heap size to 1500 Mb. Can I increase the heap memory to 75% of physical memory (6 GB Heap)?You can increase to 4GB on a 32 bit system. If you\'re on a 64 bit system you can go higher. No need to worry if you\'ve chosen incorrectly, if you ask for 5g on a 32 bit system java will complain about an invalid value and quit.As others have posted, use the cmd-line flags - e.g. You can get a full list (or a nearly full list, anyway) by typing java -X.It is possible to increase heap size allocated by the JVM by using command line options\nHere we have 3 optionsIn the above line we can set minimum heap to 16mb and maximum heap 64mbOn a 32-bit JVM, the largest heap size you can theoretically set is 4gb.  To use a larger heap size, you need to use a 64-bit JVM. Try the following:java -Xmx6144M -d64The -d64 flag is important as this tells the JVM to run in 64-bit mode.It is possible to increase heap size allocated by the JVM in eclipse directly \nIn eclipse IDE gotoRun---->Run Configurations---->ArgumentsEnter -Xmx1g(It is used to set the max size like Xmx256m or Xmx1g...... m-->mb g--->gb)java -d64 -Xms512m -Xmx4g HelloWorldwhere,\n-d64: Will enable 64-bit JVM\n-Xms512m: Will set initial heap size as 512 MB\n-Xmx4g: Will set maximum heap size as 4 GB\n(here java file name is : HelloWorld.java)Can I increase the heap memory to 75%\n  of physical memory(6GB Heap).Yes you can.  In fact, you can increase to more than the amount of physical memory, if you want to.Whether it is a good idea to do this depends on how much else is running on your system.  In particular, if the "working set" of the applications and services that are currently running significantly exceeds the available physical memory, your system is liable to "thrash", spending a lot of time moving virtual memory pages to and from disk.  The net effect is that the system gets horribly slow.This is only work with 64 bit version of java. go to control panel click on java icon. open small window of java control panel. click on java menu bar then click view button.If you have two java platform ,disable previous version of java, then click on Runtime parameters text field. Write down here -Xmx1024m or less than RAM SIZE. don\'t increase heap size equal to RAM.otherwise your system will be crash.Please use below command to change heap size to 6GBSeveral people pointed out the specific answers for heap size with the jvm options of -Xms and -Xms. I want to point out that this is not the only type of memory options for the jvm. Specifically if you are get stack over flows, then you\'ll want to increase the size of the stack by adding an additional option like -Xss8m. For this problem, the jvm options of something like -Xms2g -Xmx6g -Xss8m would be a solution.I\'m sharing this information as my google searches on how to increase jvm memory took me to this solution, and the solutions didn\'t work with high amounts of memory allocation. Once I figured out what the specific settings were for, I was able to google how to increase the stack size and found the missing param. :) Hope this saves others time, as it would of saved me a ton of time. :)Yes. You Can.You can increase your heap memory to 75% of physical memory (6 GB Heap) or higher.Since You are using 64bit you can increase your heap size to your desired amount. In Case you are using 32bit it is limited to 4GB.Sets you with initial heap size to 512mb and maximum heapsize to 6GB.Hope it Helps.. :)
