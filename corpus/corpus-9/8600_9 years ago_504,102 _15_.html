What\'s the simplest SQL statement that will return the duplicate values for a given column and the count of their occurrences in an Oracle database table?For example: I have a JOBS table with the column JOB_NUMBER.  How can I find out if I have any duplicate JOB_NUMBERs, and how many times they\'re duplicated?Another way:Works fine (quick enough) when there is index on column_name. And it\'s better way to delete or update duplicate rows.Simplest I can think of:You don\'t need to even have the count in the returned columns if you don\'t need to know the actual number of duplicates. e.g.How about:To answer the example above, it would look like:In case where  multiple columns identify unique row (e.g relations table ) there you can use following Use row id \n  e.g.  emp_dept(empid, deptid, startdate, enddate)\n   suppose empid and deptid are unique and identify row in that caseand if such table has primary key then use primary key instead of rowid, e.g id is pk thenDoingwill give you the duplicated rows\' ids.1. solutionAlso u can try something like this to list all duplicate values in  a table say reqitem
