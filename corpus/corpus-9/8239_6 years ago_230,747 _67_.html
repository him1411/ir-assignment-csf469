Which of the following is the best and most portable way to get the hostname of the current computer in Java?Runtime.getRuntime().exec("hostname") vs InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()Strictly speaking - you have no choice but calling either hostname(1) or - on Unix gethostname(2). This is the name of your computer. Any attempt to determine the hostname by an IP address like thisis bound to fail in some circumstances:Also don\'t confuse the name of an IP-address with the name of the host (hostname). A metaphor might make it clearer:There is a large city (server) called "London". Inside the city walls much business happens. The city has several gates (IP addresses). Each gate has a name ("North Gate", "River Gate", "Southampton Gate"...) but the name of the gate is not the name of the city. Also you cannot deduce the name of the city by using the name of a gate - "North Gate" would catch half of the bigger cities and not just one city. However - a stranger (IP packet) walks along the river and asks a local: "I have a strange address: \'Rivergate, second left, third house\'. Can you help me?" The local says: "Of course, you are on the right road, simply go ahead and you will arrive at your destination within half an hour."This illustrates it pretty much I think.The good news is: The real hostname is usually not necessary. In most cases any name which resolves into an IP address on this host will do. (The stranger might enter the city by Northgate, but helpful locals translate the "2nd left" part.)If the remaining corner cases you must use the definitive source of this configuration setting - which is the C function gethostname(2). That function is also called by the program hostname. InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() is the more portable way.exec("hostname") actually calls out to the operating system to execute the hostname command. Here are a couple other related answers on SO: EDIT: You should take a look at A.H.\'s answer or Arnout Engelen\'s answer for details on why this might not work as expected, depending on your situation. As an answer for this person who specifically requested portable, I still think getHostName() is fine, but they bring up some good points that should be considered.As others have noted, getting the hostname based on DNS resolution is unreliable.Since this question is unfortunately still relevant in 2016, I\'d like to share with you my network-independent solution, with some test runs on different systems.The following code tries to do the following:On WindowsRead the COMPUTERNAME environment variable through System.getenv().Execute hostname.exe and read the responseOn LinuxRead the HOSTNAME environment variable through System.getenv()Execute hostname and read the responseRead /etc/hostname (to do this I\'m executing cat since the snippet already contains code to execute and read. Simply reading the file would be better, though).The code:Results for different operating systems:OpenSuse 13.1Ubuntu 14.04 LTS \nThis one is kinda strange since echo $HOSTNAME returns the correct hostname, but System.getenv("HOSTNAME") does not:EDIT: According to legolas108, System.getenv("HOSTNAME") works on Ubuntu 14.04 if you run export HOSTNAME before executing the Java code.Windows 7The machine names have been replaced but I kept the capitalization and structure. Note the extra newline when executing hostname, you might have to take it into account in some cases.InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() is better (as explained by Nick), but still not very goodOne host can be known under many different hostnames. Usually you\'ll be looking for the hostname your host has in a specific context.For example, in a web application, you might be looking for the hostname used by whoever issued the request you\'re currently handling. How to best find that one depends on which framework you\'re using for your web application.In some kind of other internet-facing service, you\'ll want the hostname your service is available through from the \'outside\'. Due to proxies, firewalls etc this might not even be a hostname on the machine your service is installed on - you might try to come up with a reasonable default, but you should definitely make this configurable for whoever installs this.Environment variables may also provide a useful means -- COMPUTERNAME on Windows, HOSTNAME on most modern Unix/Linux shells.See:  https://stackoverflow.com/a/17956000/768795I\'m using these as "supplementary" methods to InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName(), since as several people point out, that function doesn\'t work in all environments.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("hostname") is another possible supplement. At this stage, I haven\'t used it.The most portable way to get the hostname of the current computer in Java is as follows:Although this topic has already been answered there\'s more to say.First of all: Clearly we need some definitions here. The InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() gives you the name of the host as seen from a network perspective. The problems with this approach are well documented in the other answers:  it often requires a DNS lookup, it\'s ambiguous if the host has multiple network interfaces and it just plain fails sometimes (see below).But on any OS there\'s another name as well. A name of the host that gets defined very early in the boot process, long before the network is initialized. Windows refers to this as computername, Linux calls it kernel hostname and Solaris uses the word nodename. I like best the word computername, so I\'ll use that word from now on.On Linux/Unix the computername is what you get from the C function gethostname(), or hostname command from shell or HOSTNAME environment variable in Bash-like shells.On Windows the computername is what you get from environment variable COMPUTERNAME or Win32 GetComputerName function.Java has no way of obtaining what I\'ve defined as \'computername\'. Sure, there are workarounds as described in other answers, like for Windows calling System.getenv("COMPUTERNAME"), but on Unix/Linux there\'s no good workaround without resorting to JNI/JNA or Runtime.exec(). If you don\'t mind a JNI/JNA solution then there\'s gethostname4j which is dead simple and very easy to use.Let\'s move on with two examples, one from Linux and one from Solaris, which demonstrate how you can easily get into a situation where you cannot obtain the computername using standard Java methods.On a newly created system, where the host during installation has been named as \'chicago\', we now change the so-called kernel hostname:Now the kernel hostname is \'dallas\', as evident from the hostname command:But we still haveThere\'s no misconfiguration in this. It just means the host\'s networked name (or rather the name of the loopback interface) is different from the host\'s computername.Now, try executing InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()  and it will throw java.net.UnknownHostException. You are basically stuck. There\'s no way to retrieve neither the value \'dallas\' nor the value \'chicago\'.The example below is based on Solaris 11.3.The host has deliberately been configured so that the loopback name <> nodename.In other words we have:and the contents of /etc/hosts :and the result of the hostname command would be:Just like in the Linux example a call to InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() will fail with Just like the Linux example you are now stuck. There\'s no way to retrieve neither the value \'dallas\' nor the value \'chicago\'.Very often you\'ll find that InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() will indeed return a value which is equal to the computername. So there\'s no problem (except for the added overhead of name resolution).The problem arises typically within PaaS environments where there\'s a difference between computername and the name of the loopback interface. For example people report problems in Amazon EC2.A bit of searching reveals this RFE report : link1, link2. However, judging from the comments on that report the issue seems to have been largely misunderstood by the JDK team, so it is unlikely it will be addressed.I like the comparison in the RFE to other programming languages.If you\'re not against using an external dependency from maven central, I wrote gethostname4j to solve this problem for myself. It just uses JNA to call libc\'s gethostname function (or gets the ComputerName on Windows) and returns it to you as a string.https://github.com/mattsheppard/gethostname4jInetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() is the best way out of the two as this is the best abstraction at the developer level.
