I am using git. I did a pull from a remote repo and got an error message: "please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch."I try to type a message and press enter but nothing happens. How do I tell git/terminal I am done typing in my message? I am using terminal on OS X.It\'s not a Git error message, it\'s the editor as git uses your default editor.  To solve this:Actually it\'s not an error! It means you should enter some message to mark this merge. My OS is Ubuntu 14.04.If you use the same OS ,you just need to do this as follows:Now if you go to .git and you will find the file "Merge_feature01", that\'s the merge log actually.Actually it\'s not an error! It means you should enter some message to mark this merge. My OS is Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS If you use the same OS ,you just need to do this as follows:Now if you go to .git and you will find the file "Merge_feature01", that\'s the merge log actually.Instead, you could git "ctrl+z" and retry the commit but this time add " -m " with a message in quotes after it, then it will commit without prompting you with that page.
