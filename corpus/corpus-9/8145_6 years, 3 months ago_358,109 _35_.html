I have 2 tables: T1 and T2, they are existing tables with data.  We have a one to many relationship between T1 and T2.  How do I alter the table definitions to perform cascading delete in SQL Server when a record from T1 is deleted, all associated records in T2 also deleted. The foreign constraint is in place between them. I don\'t want to drop the tables or create a trigger to do the deletion for T2. For example, when I delete an employee, all the review record should be gone, too.T1 - Employee,T2 - Performance Reviews,You will need to,Something like:To add "Cascade delete" to an existing foreign key in SQL Server Management Studio:First, select your Foreign Key, and open it\'s "DROP and Create To.." in a new Query window.Then, just add ON DELETE CASCADE to the ADD CONSTRAINT command:\nAnd hit the "Execute" button to run this query.By the way, to get a list of your Foreign Keys, and see which ones have "Cascade delete" turned on, you can run this script:And if you ever find that you can\'t DROP a particular table due to a Foreign Key constraint, but you can\'t work out which FK is causing the problem, then you can use the SQL I\'ve provided here:How can I list all foreign keys referencing a given table in SQL Server?The SQL in that article lists all FKs which reference a particular table.Hope all this helps.  Particularly the long finger.You can do this with SQL Server Management Studio.\xe2\x86\x92 Right click the table design and go to Relationships and choose the foreign key on the left-side pane and in the right-side pane, expand the menu "INSERT and UPDATE specification" and select "Cascade" as Delete Rule.Use something likeFill in the correct column names and you should be set. As mark_s correctly stated, if you have already a foreign key constraint in place, you maybe need to delete the old one first and then create the new one.First To Enable ONCascade property:1.Drop the existing foreign key constraint2.add a new one with the ON DELETE CASCADE setting enabledEx:Second To Disable ONCascade property:1.Drop the existing foreign key constraint  2.Add a new one with the ON DELETE NO ACTION setting enabledEx:ON DELETE CASCADE\nIt specifies that the child data is deleted when the parent data is deleted.CREATE TABLE products\n( product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  product_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n  category VARCHAR(25)\n);CREATE TABLE inventory\n( inventory_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  product_id INT NOT NULL,\n  quantity INT,\n  min_level INT,\n  max_level INT,\n  CONSTRAINT fk_inv_product_id\n    FOREIGN KEY (product_id)\n    REFERENCES products (product_id)\n    ON DELETE CASCADE\n);For this foreign key, we have specified the ON DELETE CASCADE clause which tells SQL Server to delete the corresponding records in the child table when the data in the parent table is deleted. So in this example, if a product_id value is deleted from the products table, the corresponding records in the inventory table that use this product_id will also be deleted.I think you cannot just delete the tables property what if this is actual production data, just delete the contents that dont affect the table schema.
