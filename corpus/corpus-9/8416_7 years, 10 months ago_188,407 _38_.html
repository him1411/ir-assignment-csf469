I need to create a CSS stylesheet class dynamically in JavaScript and assign it to some HTML elements like - div, table, span, tr, etc and to some controls like asp:Textbox, Dropdownlist and datalist.Is it possible?It would be nice with a sample.Although I\'m not sure why you want to create CSS classes with JavaScript, here is an option:Found a better solution, which works across all browsers.\nUses document.styleSheet to add or replace rules. Accepted answer is short and handy but this works across IE8 and less too.  Function is used as follows.  Note that even though function name is createClass it actually creates a selector. So dont forget to add .(period) before your class name.\nNo need to mention that you can create other selectors too with this function.\nFound here http://www.happycode.info/create-css-classes-with-javascript/Short answer, this is compatible "on all browsers" (specifically, IE8/7):And this final bit applies the class to an element:Here\'s a little test page as well: https://gist.github.com/shadybones/9816763The key little bit is the fact that style elements have a "styleSheet"/"sheet" property which you can use to to add/remove rules on.There is a light jQuery plugin which allows to generate CSS declarations: jQuery-injectCSSIn fact, it uses JSS (CSS described by JSON), but it\'s quite easy to handle in order to generate dynamic css stylesheets.YUI has by far the best stylesheet utility I have seen out there. I encourage you to check it out, but here\'s a taste:There are obviously other much simpler ways of changing styles on the fly such as those suggested here. If they make sense for your problem, they might be best, but there are definitely reasons why modifying css is a better solution. The most obvious case is when you need to modify a large number of elements. The other major case is if you need your style changes to involve the cascade. Using the dom to modify an element will always have a higher priority. Its the sledgehammer approach and is equivalent to using the style attribute directly on the html element. That is not always the desired effect.As of IE 9. You can now load a text file and set a style.innerHTML property. So essentially you can now load a css file through ajax (and get the callback) and then just set the text inside of a style tag like this.This works in other browsers, not sure how far back. But as long as you don\'t need to support IE8 then it would work.and then you can have it pull an external file like the myCss.cssHere is Vishwanath\'s solution slightly rewritten with comments :The following may be of interest. Not fully sure of its adoption by modern browsers, but it should do what you need it to do:http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/https://jsfiddle.net/xk6Ut/256/One option to dynamically create and update CSS class in JavaScript:........ Looked through the answers and the most obvious and straight forward is missing: use document.write() to write out a chunk of CSS you need.Here is an example (view it on codepen: http://codepen.io/ssh33/pen/zGjWga): An interesting project which could help you out in your task is JSS.JSS is a better abstraction over CSS. It uses JavaScript as a language\n  to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. It is a high\n  performance JS to CSS compiler which works at runtime in the browsers and server-side.JSS library allows you to inject in the DOM/head section using the .attach() function.Repl online version for evaluation.Further information on JSS.An example:you can just use the ccsom module:The javascript code attempts to be cross browser when putting the css node into the document head.For the benefit of searchers; if you are using jQuery, you can do the following:Obviously you can change the inner css to whatever you want.Appreciate some people prefer pure JavaScript, but it works and has been pretty robust for writing/overwriting styles dynamically.
