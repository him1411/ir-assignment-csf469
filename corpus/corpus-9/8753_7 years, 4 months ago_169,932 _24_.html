In Java I\'m trying to test for a null value, from a ResultSet, where the column is being cast to a primitive int type. From the code fragment above, is there a better way to do this, and I assume that the second wasNull() test is redundant?Educate us, and Thanks The default for ResultSet.getInt when the field value is NULL is to return 0, which is also the default value for your iVal declaration. In which case your test is completely redundant.If you actually want to do something different if the field value is NULL, I suggest:(Edited as @martin comments below; the OP code as written would not compile because iVal is not initialised)Another solution:I think, it is redundant. rs.getObject("ID_PARENT") should return an Integer object or null, if the column value actually was NULL. So it should even be possible to do something like:Just check if the field is null or not using ResultSet#getObject(). Substitute -1 with whatever null-case value you want.Or, if you can guarantee that you use the right DB column type so that ResultSet#getObject() really returns an Integer (and thus not Long, Short or Byte), then you can also just typecast it to an Integer.AFAIK you can simply useeven if it is NULL.Just an update with Java Generics.You could create an utility method to retrieve an optional value of any Java type from a given ResultSet, previously casted.Unfortunately, getObject(columnName, Class) does not return null, but the default value for given Java type, so 2 calls are required In this example, your code could look like below:Happy to get feedbackWith java 8 you can do this:In that case you ensure that the nVal will be null (and not zero) if the SQL value is NULLFor convenience, you can create a wrapper class around ResultSet that returns null values when ResultSet ordinarily would not.Another nice way of checking, if you have control the SQL, is to add a default value in the query itself for your int column. Then just check for that value.e.g for an Oracle database, use NVLthen checkOf course this also is under the assumption that there is a value that wouldn\'t normally be found in the column.
