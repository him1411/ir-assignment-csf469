ASP.NET MVC4 Web API application defines post method to save customer.\nCustomer is passed in json format in POST request body.\nCustomer parameter in post method contains null values for properties.How to fix this so that posted data will passed as customer object ?If possible Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded should used since I dont know how to change it in javascript method which posts form.Controller:Request:UseYou need to use JSON.stringify method to convert it to JSON format when you send it,And the model binding will bind the json data to your class object.The below code will work fine (tested)ResultcontentType property tells the server that we are sending the data in JSON format. Since we sent a JSON data structure,model binding will happen properly.If you inspect the ajax request\'s headers, you can see that  the Content-Type value is set as application/json.If you do not specify contentType explicitly, It will use the default content type which is application/x-www-form-urlencoded; Edit on Nov 2015 to address other possible issues raised in commentsLet\'s say you have a complex view model class as your web api action method parameter like thisand your web api end point is likeAt the time of this writing, ASP.NET MVC 6 is the latest stable version and in MVC6, Both Web api controllers and MVC controllers are inheriting from Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.Controller base class.To send data to the method from client side, the below code should work fineIf you do not decorate the web api method parameter with [FromBody] attributeAnd send the model(raw javascript object, not in JSON format) without specifying the contentType property valueModel binding will work for the flat properties on the model, not the properties where the type is complex/another type. In our case, Id and Name properties will be properly bound to the parameter m, But the Tags property will be an empty list.The same problem will occur if you are using the short version, $.post which will use the default Content-Type when sending the request.Working with POST in webapi can be tricky!\nWould like to add to the already correct answer..Will focus specifically on POST as dealing with GET is trivial. I don\'t think many would be searching around for resolving an issue with GET with webapis. Anyways..If your question is - In MVC Web Api, how to- - Use custom action method names other than the generic HTTP verbs? - Perform multiple posts? - Post multiple simple types? - Post complex types via jQuery?Then the following solutions may help:First, to use Custom Action Methods in Web API, add a web api route as:And then you may create action methods like:Now, fire the following jQuery from your browser consoleSecond, to perform multiple posts, It is simple, create multiple action methods and decorate with the [HttpPost] attrib. Use the [ActionName("MyAction")] to assign custom names, etc. Will come to jQuery in the fourth point belowThird, First of all, posting multiple SIMPLE types in a single action is not possible.\nMoreover, there is a special format to post even a single simple type (apart from passing the parameter in the query string or REST style). \nThis was the point that had me banging my head with Rest Clients (like Fiddler and Chrome\'s Advanced REST client extension) and hunting around the web for almost 5 hours when eventually, the following URL proved to be of help. Will quote the relevant content for the link might turn dead!PS: Noticed the peculiar syntax?http://forums.asp.net/t/1883467.aspx?The+received+value+is+null+when+I+try+to+Post+to+my+Web+ApiAnyways, let us get over that story. Moving on:Fourth, posting complex types via jQuery, ofcourse, $.ajax() is going to promptly come in the role:Let us say the action method accepts a Person object which has an id and a name. So, from javascript:And the action will look like:All of the above, worked for me!! Cheers!I\'ve just been playing with this and discovered a rather odd result. Say you have public properties on your class in C# like this:then you must do the JSON.stringify trick as suggested by Shyju and call it like this:However, if you define getters and setters on your class like this:then you can call it much more simply:This uses the HTTP header:I\'m not quite sure what\'s happening here but it looks like a bug (feature?) in the framework. Presumably the different binding methods are calling different "adapters", and while the adapter for application/json one works with public properties, the one for form encoded data doesn\'t.I have no idea which would be considered best practice though.Use the JSON.stringify() to get the string in JSON format, ensure that while making the AJAX call you pass below mentioned attributes:Below is the give jquery code to make ajax post call to asp.net web api:Make sure that your WebAPI service is expecting a strongly typed object with a structure that matches the JSON that you are passing.  And make sure that you stringify the JSON that you are POSTing.Here is my JavaScript (using AngluarJS):And here is my WebAPI Controller:Following code to return data in the json format ,instead of the xml -Web API 2 :-Put following line in the Global.asax file Microsoft gave a good example of doing this:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/advanced/sending-html-form-data-part-1First validate the requestand than use the serialized data. Here \'Status\' is a field in the complex type. Serializing is done by .NET, no need to worry about that.
