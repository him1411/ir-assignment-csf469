I have asp.net web api rest service where I need to pass an array of integers. How can this be done in asp.net 4 web api.Url to access the above serviceYou just need to add [FromUri] before parameter, looks like:And send request: As Filip W points out, you might have to resort to a custom model binder like this (modified to bind to actual type of param):And then you can say:/Categories?categoryids=1,2,3,4 and ASP.NET Web API will correctly bind your categoryIds array.I recently came across this requirement myself, and I decided to implement an ActionFilter to handle this.I am applying it like so (note that I used \'id\', not \'ids\', as that is how it is specified in my route):And the public url would be:You may have to refactor this to meet your specific needs.In case someone would need - to achieve same or similar thing(like delete) via POST instead of FromUri, use FromBody and on client side(JS/jQuery) format param as $.param({ \'\': categoryids }, true)c#:jQuery:The thing with $.param({ \'\': categoryids }, true) is that it .net will expect post body to contain urlencoded value like =1&=2&=3 without parameter name, and without brackets.You may try this code for you to take comma separated values / an array of values to get back a JSON from webAPIOutput :Easy way to send array params to web api API Jquery : send JSON object as request paramsIt will generate your request URL like \n../api/categories/GetCategories?categoryIds=1&categoryIds=2&categoryIds=3&categoryIds=4Usage:Request uriIf you want to list/ array of integers easiest way to do this is accept the comma(,) separated list of string and convert it to list of integers.Do not forgot to mention [FromUri] attriubte.your url look like:...?ID=71&accountID=1,2,3,289,56Make the method type [HttpPost], create a model that has one int[] parameter, and post with json:I addressed this issue this way.I used a post message to the api to send the list of integers as data.Then I returned the data as an ienumerable.The sending code is as follows:The receiving code is as follows:It works just fine for one record or many records.  The fill is an overloaded method using DapperExtensions:This allows you to fetch data from a composite table (the id list), and then return the records you are really interested in from the target table.You could do the same with a view, but this gives you a little more control and flexibility.In addition, the details of what you are seeking from the database are not shown in the query string.  You also do not have to convert from a csv file.You have to keep in mind when using any tool like the web api 2.x interface is that the get, put, post, delete, head, etc., functions have a general use, but are not restricted to that use.So, while post is generally used in a create context in the web api interface, it is not restricted to that use.  It is a regular html call that can be used for any purpose permitted by html practice.In addition, the details of what is going on are hidden from those "prying eyes" we hear so much about these days.The flexibility in naming conventions in the web api 2.x interface and use of regular web calling means you send a call to the web api that misleads snoopers into thinking you are really doing something else.  You can use "POST" to really retrieve data, for example.Or you could just pass a string of delimited items and put it into an array or list on the receiving end.
