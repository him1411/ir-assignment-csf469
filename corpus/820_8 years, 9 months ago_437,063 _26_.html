What is the most pythonic way to pad a numeric string with zeroes to the left, i.e., so the numeric string has a specific length?Strings:And for numbers:String formatting documentation.Just use the rjust method of the string object.This example will make a string of 10 characters long, padding as necessary.For numbers:See also: Python: String formatting.EDIT: It\'s worth noting that as of yesterday December 3rd, 2008, this method of formatting is deprecated in favour of the format string method:See PEP 3101 for details.if you want the opposite:str(n).zfill(width) will work with strings, ints, floats... and is Python 2.x and 3.x compatible:Works in both Python 2 and Python 3:See the print documentation for all the exciting details!Update for Python 3.x (7.5 years later)That last line should now be:I.e. print() is now a function, not a statement. Note that I still prefer the Old School printf() style because, IMNSHO, it reads better, and because, um, I\'ve been using that notation since January, 1980. Something ... old dogs .. something something ... new tricks.For the ones who came here to understand and not just a quick answer.\nI do these especially for time strings:"0" symbols what to replace with the "2" padding characters, the default is an empty space">" symbols allign all the 2 "0" character to the left of the string":" symbols the format_specthis will work in python 3.xFor zip codes saved as integers:Quick timing comparison:I\'ve made different tests of different repetitions. The differences are not huge, but in all tests, the zfill solution was fastest.You could also repeat "0", prepend it to str(n) and get the rightmost width slice. Quick and dirty little expression.
