How can I format a JavaScript date object to print as "10-Aug-2010"?You can edit the array monthNames to use Jan, Feb, Mar, etc..Use the date.format library:returns:dateformat on npmhttp://jsfiddle.net/phZr7/1/Well, what I wanted was to convert today\'s date to a MySQL friendly date string like 2012-06-23, and to use that string as a parameter in one of my queries. The simple solution I\'ve found is this:Keep in mind that the above solution does not take into account your timezone offset.You might consider using this function instead:This will give you the correct date in case you are executing this code around the start/end of the day.If you need to quickly format your date using plain JavaScript, use getDate, getMonth + 1, getFullYear, getHours and getMinutes:Or, if you need it to be padded with zeros:The toLocaleDateString() method returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of the date portion of the date. The locales and options arguments let applications specify the language whose formatting conventions should be used and allow to customize the behavior of the function.All these keys are optional.You can change the number of options values based on your requirements.You can use more language options.You can also use the toLocaleString() method for the same purpose. The only difference is this function provides the time when you don\'t pass any options.For toLocaleString()https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleStringFor toLocaleDateString()https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateStringIf you are already using jQuery UI in your project you could do it this way: Some datepicker date format options to play with are available here.I think you can just use the non-standard Date method toLocaleFormat(formatString)formatString: A format string in the same format expected by the strftime() function in C.References:In modern browsers (*), you can just do this:Output if executed today (january 24\xe1\xb5\x97\xca\xb0, 2016):(*) According to MDN, "modern browsers" means Chrome 24+, Firefox 29+, Internet Explorer 11, Edge 12+, Opera 15+ & Safari nightly build.Plain JavaScript is the best pick for small onetimers.On the other hand, if you need more date stuff, MomentJS is a great solution.For example:You should have a look at date.js. It adds many convenient helpers for working with dates, for example, in your case:Getting started: http://www.datejs.com/2007/11/27/getting-started-with-datejs/For fixed formats, a simple function make the job. Following example generate the international format YYYY-MM-DD:The OP format may be generated like:Note: It is, however, usually not a good idea to extend the Javascript standard libraries (e.g. by adding this function to the prototype of Date). A more advanced function could generate configurable output based on a format parameter.If to write a formatting function is too long, there are plenty of libraries around which does it. Some other answers already enumerate them. But increasing dependencies also has it counter-part.Since more recent versions of ECMAscript, the Date class has some specific formatting functions:toDateString: Implementation dependent, show only the date.http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.todatestringtoISOString: Show ISO 8601 date and time.http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.toisostringtoJSON: Stringifier for JSON. http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.tojsontoLocaleDateString: Implementation dependent, a date in locale format.http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.tolocaledatestringtoLocaleString: Implementation dependent, a date&time in locale format.http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.tolocalestringtoLocaleTimeString: Implementation dependent, a time in locale format.http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.tolocaletimestringtoString: Generic toString for Date.http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.tostringNote: it is possible to generate custom output out of those formatting functions:@S\xc3\xa9bastien  -- alternative all browser supportDocumentation:\n https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateStringI can get your requested format in one line using no libraries and no Date methods, just regex: Update: As @RobG pointed out, the output of Date.prototype.toString() is implementation-dependent. So, use with caution and modify if necessary for your implementations if you use this solution. In my testing, this works reliably in North America where the major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE) all return the same string format.If you are using jQuery UI in your code, there is an inbuilt function called formatDate(). I am using it this way to format today\'s date:You can see  many other examples of formatting date in the jQuery UI documentation.Here\'s is some code I just wrote to handle the date formatting for a project I\'m working on. It mimics the PHP date formatting functionality to suit my needs. Feel free to use it, it\'s just extending the already existing Date() object. This may not be the most elegant solution but it\'s working for my needs.We have lots of solutions for this, but I think the best of them is Moment.js. So I personally suggest to use Moment.js for date and time operations.JavaScript solution without using any external libraries:Sugar.js has excellent extensions to the Date object, including a Date.format method.Examples from the documentation:This is how I implemented for my npm pluginsTry this:Here is a script that does exactly what you wanthttps://github.com/UziTech/js-date-formatInspired by JD Smith\'s marvellous regular expression solution, I suddenly had this head-splitting idea:OK, we have got something called Intl which is very useful for formatting date in JavaScript:Your date as below:And you change to Date by using new Date() like below:And now you can format it anyway you like using list of locales like below:If you are exactly want the format you mentioned above, you can do:And the result gonna be:For more details about ECMAScript Internationalization API (Intl), visit hereusing es6 string template :If you need to change the delimiters :You\'re welcomeAdd the jQuery UI plugin to your page:I use the following. It is simple and works fine.Or this:If you are already using ExtJS in your project you could use Ext.Date: returns:If you fancy a short, human-readable, function - this is easily adjustable to suit you.The timeStamp parameter is milliseconds from 1970 - it is returned by new Date().getTime() and many other devices...OK, I changed my mind. I included an extra function for zero padding. Curses!There is a new library, smarti.to.js, for localized formatting of JavaScript numbers, dates and JSON dates (Microsoft or ISO8601).Example:There are also custom short patterns defined in the localization file (smarti.to.{culture}.js). Example (smarti.to.et-EE.js):And a multiformatting ability:
