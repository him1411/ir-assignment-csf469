I\'m trying to get the number of rows of dataframe df with Pandas, and here is my code.Both the code snippets give me this error:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: \'instancemethod\' and \'int\'What am I doing wrong?According to the answer given by @root the best (the fastest) way to check df length is to call:You can use the .shape property or just len(DataFrame.index). However, there are notable performance differences ( the .shape property is faster):EDIT: As @Dan Allen noted in the comments len(df.index) and df[0].count() are not interchangeable as count excludes NaNs,Use len(df). This works as of pandas 0.11 or maybe even earlier.__len__() is currently (0.12) documented with Returns length of index. Timing info, set up the same way as in root\'s answer:Due to one additional function call it is a bit slower than calling len(df.index) directly, but this should not play any role in most use cases.suppose df is your dataframe then:Apart from above answers use can use df.axes to get the tuple with row and column indexes and then use len() function:For getting rows useand for columns useYou can always use len(func) for getting the count of list, hence you can use\nlen(df.index) for getting the number of rows.But keep in mind, as stated by @root, using shape[0] and shape[1] for getting the number of rows and columns, respectively, is a faster option.I come to pandas from R background, and I see that pandas is more complicated when it comes to selecting row or column.\nI had to wrestle with it for a while, then I found some ways to deal with:getting the number of columns:getting the number of rows:df.shape returns the shape of the data frame in the form of a tuple (no. of rows, no. of cols).You can simply access no. of rows or no. of cols with df.shape[0] or df.shape[1], respectively, which is same as accessing the values of the tuple.For dataframe df, a printed comma formatted row count used while exploring data:    Example:you can try:
