I\'m receiving the following error with express:I am using meanstack. I have the following use statements in my express.jsWithin fiddler I can see the content-length header with a value of: 1078702I believe this is in octets, this is 1.0787 megabytes.I have no idea why express is not letting me post the json array I was posting previously in another express project that was not using the mean stack project structure.I had the same error recently, and all the solutions I\'ve found did not work.After some digging, I found that setting app.use(express.bodyParser({limit: \'50mb\'})); did set the limit correctly. When adding a console.log(\'Limit file size: \'+limit); in node_modules/express/node_modules/connect/lib/middleware/json.js:46 and restarting node, I get this output in the console: We can see that at first, when loading the connect module, the limit is set to 1mb (1048576 bytes). Then when I set the limit, the console.log is called again and this time the limit is 52428800 (50mb). However, I still get a 413 Request entity too large.Then I added console.log(\'Limit file size: \'+limit); in  node_modules/express/node_modules/connect/node_modules/raw-body/index.js:10 and saw another line in the console when calling the route with a big request (before the error output) : This means that somehow, somewhere, connect resets the limit parameter and ignores what we specified. I tried specifying the bodyParser parameters in the route definition individually, but no luck either.While I did not find any proper way to set it permanently, you can "patch" it in the module directly. If you are using Express 3.4.4, add this at line 46 of node_modules/express/node_modules/connect/lib/middleware/json.js :The line number might differ if you don\'t run the same version of Express.\nPlease note that this is a bad practice and will be overwritten if you update your module.So this temporary solution works for now, but as soon as a solution is found (or the module fixed, in case it\'s a module problem) you should update your code accordingly.I have opened an issue on their Github about this problem.[edit - found the solution]After some research and testing, I found that when debugging, I added app.use(express.bodyParser({limit: \'50mb\'}));, but after app.use(express.json());. Express would then set the global limit to 1mb because the first parser he encountered when running the script was express.json(). Moving bodyParser above it did the trick.That said, the bodyParser() method will be deprecated in Connect 3.0 and should not be used. Instead, you should declare your parsers explicitely, like so :In case you need multipart (for file uploads) see this post.Second editNote that in Express 4, instead of express.json() and express.urlencoded(), you must require the body-parser module and use its json() and urlencoded() methods, like so :If the extended option is not explicitly defined for bodyParser.urlencoded(), it will throw a warning (body-parser deprecated undefined extended: provide extended option). This is because this option will be required in the next version and not be optional anymore. For more info on the extended option, please refer to the readme of body-parser.I use Express 4.In my case it was not enough to add these lines :I tried adding the parameterLimit option on urlencoded function as the documentation says and error no longer appears.The parameterLimit option controls the maximum number of parameters\n  that are allowed in the URL-encoded data. If a request contains more\n  parameters than this value, a 413 will be returned to the client.\n  Defaults to 1000.Try with this code:I don\'t think this is the express global size limit, but specifically the connect.json middleware limit. This is 100kb by default when you use express.bodyParser() and don\'t provide a limit option.Try:If someone tried all the answers, but hadn\'t had any success yet and uses NGINX to host the site add this line to /etc/nginx/sites-available2016, none of the above worked for me until i explicity set the \'type\' in addition to the \'limit\' for bodyparser, example:in my case .. setting parameterLimit:50000 fixed the problemI\'ve used another practice for this problem with multer dependancie.Example: Little old post but I had the same problemUsing express 4.+\nmy code looks like this and it works great after two days of extensive testing.The following worked for me... Just use that\'s it.Tried all above and none worked. Found that even though we use like the following,only the 1st app.use(bodyParser()); one gets defined and the latter two lines were ignored.Refer: https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser/issues/176 >> see \'dougwilson commented on Jun 17, 2016\'
