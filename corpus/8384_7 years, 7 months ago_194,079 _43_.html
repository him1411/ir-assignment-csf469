Let see that I have a string look like this:   How do I make it so that the UILabel display the message like this   AAAAA\n  BBBBB\n  CCCCCI dont think \\n is recognized by UILabel, so is there anything that I can put inside NSString so that UILabel knows that it has to create a line break there? Thank you very much in advance.Use \\n as you are using in your string.Set numberOfLines to 0 to allow for any number of lines.label.numberOfLines = 0;Update the label frame to match the size of the text using sizeWithFont:.  If you don\'t do this your text will be vertically centered or cut off.Reference, Replacement for deprecated sizeWithFont: in iOS 7?Use option-return when typing in the little box in Interface Builder to insert a line feed (\\n). In Interface Builder\'s Label attributes, set # Lines = 0.Select the label and then change Lines property to 0 like in the below image, and then use \\n in your string for line break. If you read a string from an XML file, the line break \\n in this string will not work in UILabel text. The \\n is not parsed to a line break.Here is a little trick to solve this issue:So you have to replace the unparsed \\n part in your string by a parsed \\n in a hardcoded NSString.Here are my other label settings:Most important is to set numberOfLines to 0 (= unlimited number of lines in label).No idea why Apple has chosen to not parse \\n in strings read from XML?Hope this helps.In the interface builder, you can use Ctrl + Enter to insert /n to the position you want.\nThis way could implement the following situation aaaaaaaaaaYou have to set the numberOfLines property on the UILabel. The default is 1, if you set it to 0 it will remove all limits.Important to note it\'s \\n (backslash) rather than /n.// DO not forget to set numberOfLines to zeroIn Swift 2.2,  > iOS 8I\'ve set Lines = 0 on Storyboard, under Attribute Inspector and linked a referencing outlet to the label. Then use in controller like this:If your using a UILabel you have to remember that the default setting is 1 line, so it does not matter how many breaks you add (\\n or \\r), you need to make sure it is set to more than one line so it could be allowed to append more lines.One alternative is to use UITextView which is really meant for multilines.You can easily achieve this in XCode attribute section of the UILabel, see screenshot:On Xcode 6, you can just use \\n even inside a string when using word wrap. It will work. So for example:Just using label.numberOfLines = 0;For anyone else that might have trouble with sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode: or anyone switching to ios8 (the method is deprecated as of ios7), I adjusted my height by using sizeToFit instead. It seems wrong to me to change the label frame sizes especially when using autolayout.  Using the appendFormat method seems more appropriate.  Here is my example:If you set your UILable properties from Plain to Attributed...the UILabel will hold multiline text no matter how many paragraphs for along as your UILabel height and width are set to fit the screen area you want to display the text in.In my case also \\n was not working, I fixed issue by keeping number of lines to 0 and copied and pasted the text with new line itself for example instead of Hello \\n World  i pasted HelloWorldin the interface builder.I have faced same problem, and here is, how i solved the problem. Hope this will be helpful for someone.// Swift 2// Objective-C// C# (Xamarin.iOS)
