It seems like there are a few different techniques out there, so I was hoping to get a "definitive" answer on this...On a website, it\'s common practice to create a logo that links to the homepage. I want to do the same, while best optimizing for search engines, screen readers, IE 6+, and browsers who have disabled CSS and/or images.Example One: Doesn\'t use an h1 tag. Not as good for SEO, right?Example Two: Found this somewhere. The CSS seems a little hacky.Example Three: Same HTML, different approach using text-indent. This is the "Phark" approach to image replacement.Example Four: The Leahy-Langridge-Jefferies method. Displays when images and/or css is turned off.What method is the best for this sort of thing? Please provide html and css in your answer.You\'re missing the option:I do it mostly like the one above, but for accessibility reasons, I need to support the possibility of images being disabled in the browser. So, rather than indent the text from the link off the page, I cover it by absolutely positioning the <span> to the full width and height of the <a> and using z-index to place it above the link text in the stacking order.The price is one empty <span>, but I\'m willing to have it there for something as important as an <h1>.  If accessibility reasons is important then use the first variant (when customer want to see image without styles)No need to conform imaginary SEO requirements, because the HTML code above has correct structure and only you should decide does this suitable for you visitors. Also you can use the variant with less HTML codePlease note that I have removed all other CSS styles and hacks because they didn\'t correspond to the task. They may be usefull in particular cases only.I think you\'d be interested in the H1 debate. It\'s a debate about whether to use the h1 element for the page\'s title or for the logo. Personally I\'d go with your first suggestion, something along these lines:Of course this depends on whether your design uses page titles but this is my stance on this issue.You missed title in <a> element. I suggest to put title in <a> element because client would want to know what is the meaning of that image. Because you have set text-indent for the test of <h1> so, that front end user could get information of main logo while they hover on logo.Chiming in a bit late here, but couldn\'t resist.You\'re question is half-flawed. Let me explain:The first half of your question, on image replacement, is a valid question, and my opinion is that for a logo, a simple image; an alt attribute; and CSS for its positioning are sufficient.The second half of your question, on the "SEO value" of the H1 for a logo is the wrong approach to deciding on which elements to use for different types of content.A logo isn\'t a primary heading, or even a heading at all, and using the H1 element to markup the logo on each page of your site will do (slightly) more harm than good for your rankings. Semantically, headings (H1 - H6) are appropriate for, well, just that: headings and subheadings for content. In HTML5, more than one heading is allowed per page, but a logo isn\'t deserving of one of them. Your logo, which might be a fuzzy green widget and some text is in an image off to the side of the header for a reason - it\'s sort of a "stamp", not a hierarchical element to structure your content. The first (whether you use more depends on your heading hierarchy) H1 of each page of your site should headline its subject matter. The main primary heading of your index page might be \'The Best Source For Fuzzy Green Widgets in NYC\'. The primary heading on another page might be \'Shipping Details for Our Fuzzy Widgets\'. On another page, it may be \'About Bert\'s Fuzzy Widgets Inc.\'. You get the idea.Side note: As incredible as it sounds, don\'t look at the source of Google-owned web properties for examples of correct markup. This is a whole post unto itself. To get the most "SEO value" out HTML and its elements, take a look at the HTML5 specs, and make make markup decisions based on (HTML) semantics and value to users before search engines, and you\'ll have better success with your SEO.This was the good option for SEO because SEO gives the H1 tag high priority, inside the h1 tag should be your site name. Using this method if you search the site name in SEO it will show your site logo as well.you want to hide the site name OR text please use text-indent in negative value. exOne point no one has touched on is the fact that the h1 attribute should be specific to every page and using the site logo will effectively replicate the H1 on every page of the site.I like to use a z index hidden h1 for each page as the best SEO h1 is often not the best for sales or aesthetic value.I think example one is more than enough as alt text will be shown if images are disabled. This  wil also help search engines to know about your site.Update : Looks like I was wrong. Check this article.I don\'t know but this is the format have used...Simple and it has not done my site any harm as far as I can see.
