I\'m SSHing into a remote server on the command line, and trying to copy a directory onto my local machine with the scp command. However, the remote server returns this "usage" message:I\'d like to be able to transfer files in both directions. From what I read, I thought the above command would work for downloading, and scp -p [localpath] [remotepath] for uploading? You need to scp something somewhere. You have scp ./styles/, so you\'re saying secure copy ./styles/, but not where to copy it to.Generally, if you want to download, it will go:where local_file might actually be a directory to put the file you\'re copying in. To upload, it\'s the opposite:If you want to copy a whole directory, you will need -r. Think of scp as like cp, except you can specify a file with user@remote_host:file as well as just local files.Edit: As noted in a comment, if the usernames on the local and remote hosts are the same, then the user can be omitted when specifying a remote file.If copying to/from your desktop machine, use WinSCP, or if on Linux, Nautilus supports SCP via the Connect To Server option.scp can only copy files to a machine running sshd, hence you need to run the client software on the remote machine from the one you are running scp on.If copying on the command line, use:orYou need to specify both source and destination, and if you want to copy directories you should look at the -r option.So to recursively copy /home/user/whatever from remote server to your current directory:No, you still need to scp [from] [to] whichever way you\'re copyingThe difference is, you need to scp -p server:serverpath localpath
