I have two submit buttons in a form. How do I determine which one was hit serverside?If you give each one a name, the clicked one will be sent through as any other input.You can give each input a different value and keep the same name:Then in the code check to see which was triggered:The only problem with that is you tie your logic to the text within the input.  You could also give each one a unique name and just check the $_POST for the existence of that input:And in the code:An even better solution consists of using button tags to submit the form:This way there is no inconvenience with internationalization and multiple display languages (in the former solution, the label of the button is also the value sent to the server).There\xe2\x80\x99s a new HTML5 approach to this, the formaction attribute:Apparently this does not work in IE9 and earlier, but for other browsers you should be fine (see: w3schools.com HTML <button> formaction Attribute).Personally, I generally use Javascript to submit forms remotely (for faster perceived feedback) with this approach as backup. Between the two, the only people not covered are IE<9 with Javascript disabled.Of course, this may be inappropriate if you\xe2\x80\x99re basically taking the same action server-side regardless of which button was pushed, but often if there are two user-side actions available then they will map to two server-side actions as well.Edit:\nAs noted by Pascal_dher in the comments, this attribute is also available on the <input> tag as well.This is extremely easy to testJust put that in an HTML page, click the buttons, and look at the URLMaybe the suggested solutions here worked in 2009, but ive tested all of this upvoted answers and nobody is working in any browsers.only solution i found working is this: (but its a bit ugly to use i think)The best way to deal with multiple submit button is using switch case in server scriptserver code/server script - where you are submitting the form:demo_form.phpSource: W3Schools.comRoBorg is right, but be careful of something - at least IE6 and Firefox3 behave differently when you hit "Enter" to submit instead of clicking a submit button. FF3 seems to send the name/value pair of the first submit input along with the rest of the form, while IE6 doesn\'t send any of the submit inputs.Since you didn\'t specify what server-side scripting method you\'re using, I\'ll give you an example that works for Python, using CherryPy (although it may be useful for other contexts, too):Rather than using the value to determine which button was pressed, you can use the name (with the <button> tag instead of <input>). That way, if your buttons happen to have the same text, it won\'t cause problems. The names of all form items, including buttons, are sent as part of the URL. In CherryPy, each of those is an argument for a method that does the server-side code. So, if your method just has **kwargs for its parameter list (instead of tediously typing out every single name of each form item) then you can check to see which button was pressed like this:I think you should be able to read the name/value in your GET array.  I think that the button that wasn\'t clicked wont appear in that list.Simple you can change the action of form on different submit buttons Click.Try this in document.ReadyYou can also do it like this (I think it\'s very convenient if you have N inputs).And then in the server side (PHP in my example) you can read "row" as an array to get the index:$_POST[\'row\'] will be an array with just one element, in the form index => value (for example: \'2\' => \'something").http://php.net/manual/en/function.key.phpDefine name as array.Example server code (PHP):elseif very important, because both will be parsed if not. \nEnjoy.You can also use a href attribute and send a get with the value appended for each button. But the form wouldn\'t be required then You can present the buttons like this:And then in the code you can get the value using:(valUnits and valPrice are some other values I extract from the form that I left in for illustration)
