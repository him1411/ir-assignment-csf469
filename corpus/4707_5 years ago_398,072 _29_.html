This question already has an answer here:What\'s their difference? (1) yields an error, what\'s the reason?Andusing (2) will prompt an error. Why?One is an array of arrays, and one is a 2d array.  The former can be jagged, the latter is uniform.That is, a double[][] can validly be:Because each entry in the array is a reference to an array of double. With a jagged array, you can do an assignment to an array like you want in your second example:On the second item, because it is a uniform 2d array, you can\'t assign a 1d array to a row or column, because you must index both the row and column, which gets you down to a single double:UPDATE:To clarify based on your question, the reason your #1 had a syntax error is because you had this:And you can\'t specify the second index at the time of construction.  The key is that ServicePoint is not a 2d array, but an 1d array (of arrays) and thus since you are creating a 1d array (of arrays), you specify only one index:Then, when you create each item in the array, each of those are also arrays, so then you can specify their dimensions (which can be different, hence the term jagged array):Hope that helps!In the first instance you are trying to create what is called a jagged array.The above statement would have worked if it was defined like below. what this means is you are creating an array of size 10 ,that can store 10 differently sized arrays inside it.In simple terms an Array of arrays.see the below image,which signifies a jagged array.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2s05feca(v=vs.80).aspxThe second one is basically a two dimensional array and the syntax is correct and acceptable.And to access or modify a two dimensional array you have to pass both the dimensions,but in your case you are passing just a single dimension,thats why the errorCorrect usage would beServicePoint[0][2] ,Refers to an item on the first row ,third column.Pictorial rep of your two dimensional arraydouble[][] are called jagged arrays , The inner dimensions aren\xe2\x80\x99t specified in the declaration. Unlike a rectangular array, each inner array can be an arbitrary length. Each inner array is implicitly initialized to null rather than an empty array. Each inner array must be created manually: Reference [C# 4.0 in nutshell The definitive Reference]double[,] are called rectangular arrays, which are declared using commas to separate each dimension. The following piece of code declares a rectangular 3-by-3 two-dimensional array, initializing it with numbers from 0 to 8:double[,] is a 2d array (matrix) while double[][] is an array of arrays (jagged arrays) and the syntax is:double[][] is an array of arrays and double[,] is a matrix. If you want to initialize an array of array, you will need to do this:Take in account that using arrays of arrays will let you have arrays of different lengths:
