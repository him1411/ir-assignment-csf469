I\'ve literally tried everything I could but none of them work for a custom UIView... I just wanted a blank white view with rounded corners and a light drop shadow (with no lighting effect). I can do each of those one by one but the usual clipToBounds/maskToBounds conflicts occur.The following code snippet adds a border, border radius, and drop shadow to v, a UIView:You can adjust the settings to suit your needs.Also, add the QuartzCore framework to your project and:See my other answer regarding masksToBounds.NoteThis may not work in all cases. If you find that this method interferes with other drawing operations that you are performing, please see this answer.What if there are sublayers or subviews (like an image) whose content we want to clip to the bounds of our view?We can accomplish this with (Alternatively, blueView.clipsToBounds = true gives the same result.)But, oh no! The shadow was also clipped off because it\'s outside of the bounds! What to do? What to do?SolutionUse separate views for the shadow and the border. The base view is transparent and has the shadow. The border view clips any other subcontent that it has to its borders.This gives the following result:Adding rounded corners and shadows can be a performance hit. You can improve performance by using a predefined path for the shadow and also specifying that it be rasterized. The following code can be added to the example above.See this post for more details. See here and here also.One way to do this is to put the view with rounded corners in a view with the drop shadow.Then you can add the shadowView wherever you want.This worked for me.  Trick was to move the background color from the main view to the layer.If you are struggling because of the rounded corners vs. subviews vs. masksToBounds, then try using my function:call it on your view. whether your view has rounded corners, no matter its size, its shape - a nice shadow will be drawn.Just keep the return value of the function so you can refer to it when you want to remove the table (or for example use insertSubview:aboveView:)I solved the problem using the following trick when assigning shadow path for the container view :Notice that the path given to the shadow is a rounded rectangle with the same corner radius as the background that the cell contains:Simple Swift 3.1 solution based on Ade\'s answer without any additional subviews, subclassing or other extra fiddling: Note that you should set up your view with corner radius and other properties before calling addShadow.The call this directly from viewDidLoad like this:Final result:Super easy and simple!I\'ve created a helper on UIViewyou can call it like thisHere\'s the implementationAfter one whole day research of the round corner view with shadow, I\'m glad to post my custom uiview class here, hope to end this question:so, NO need to add subview in view or below in target view, just add one layer in current view, and do 3 step to complete it!take a close look at to the comments in the code, it\'s helpful to understanding the component!Shadow + Border + Corner Radius\nWell if you don\'t want to change your nibs and view hierarchy as suggested David C. this method will do it for you. To add rounded corners and shadow to your UIImageView just use this method, for example:(!) For performance reasons I don\'t think it is a good idea to use this code in something like UITableView, since this code changes view hierarchy. So I will suggest to change your nib and add a container view for shadow effect and use Davic C. code.Old thread still current...I\'ve edited Daniel Gindi\'s method to make it possible to use it with buttons etc. as well.\nIf anyone needs rounded corners or wants to combine round corners and a border it has to be set on the view\'s layer which is passed to this method. I\'ve also set the rasterization to speed it up a little.Here is the solution for masksToBounds conflict problem, it works for me.After you set the corderRadius/borderColor/shadow and so on, set  masksToBounds as NO:The following worked best for me \n(this code lies in UIView extension, so self denotes some UIView to which we must add a shadow and round corner)The main difference between this and other code samples is that this adds the shadow view as a sibling view (as against adding the current view as subview of shadow view), thereby eliminating the need to modify the existing view hierarchy in any way.Swift 3 & IBInspectable solution:\nInspired by Ade\'s solutionFirst, create an UIView extension:Then, simply select your UIView in interface builder setting shadow ON and corner radius, like below:The result!daniel.gindi\'s answer above did the trick for me! (+1 daniel) However, I had to make minor adjustments - change the shadowFrame size to be same as view\'s frame size, and enable user interaction. Here\'s the updated code:I would like to add that in my case, I was trying to add this to a 3rd party view controller, i.e. I did not have direct control over the code. So, here\'s how I used the function above:I make some changes to the code of daniel.gindiThis is all you need to make it work.Here is my version in Swift 3 for a UIViewI have tried so many solutions from this post and ended up with the below solution. This is full proof solution unless you need to drop shadow on a clear color view.The answer provided by Evan Mulawski will work perfectly. The catch is that you have to set the background color for the view to clearColor and the masksToBounds property to NO.You can set whatever color you want for the view, set it like Hope this helps..You need to use two UIViews to achieve this. One UIView will work like shadow and other one will work for rounded border.Here is a code snippet a Class Method with a help of a protocol:In the code above btnCompose_click: will become a @required delegate method which will fire on the button click.And here I added a button to my UIViewController like this:The result will look like this:This is how you do it, with rounded corners and rounded shadows without bothering with paths.The view with content, in my case a UIImageView, has a corner radius and therefore has to mask to bounds.We create another equally sized view for the shadows, set it\'s maskToBounds to NO and then add the content view to the container view (e.g. shadowContainer).I write this UIView category method to solve this problem, uses separate views for the shadow and the corner radius.You need to use use shadowView and roundViewshadowViewroundViewThe codeYou need add masksToBounds = true for combined between corderRadius shadowRadius.
