I\'d like to get started with ANTLR, but after spending a few hours reviewing the examples at the antlr.org site, I still can\'t get a clear understanding of the grammar to Java process.Is there some simple example, something like a four-operations calculator implemented with ANTLR going through the parser definition and all the way to the Java source code?You first create a grammar. Below is a small grammar that you can use to evaluate expressions that are built using the 4 basic math operators: +, -, * and /. You can also group expressions using parenthesis.Note that this grammar is just a very basic one: it does not handle unary operators (the minus in: -1+9) or decimals like .99 (without a leading number), to name just two shortcomings. This is just an example you can work on yourself.Here\'s the contents of the grammar file Exp.g:(Parser rules start with a lower case letter, and lexer rules start with a capital letter)After creating the grammar, you\'ll want to generate a parser and lexer from it. Download the ANTLR jar and store it in the same directory as your grammar file.Execute the following command on your shell/command prompt:It should not produce any error message, and the files ExpLexer.java, ExpParser.java and Exp.tokens should now be generated.To see if it all works properly, create this test class:and compile it:and then run it:If all goes well, nothing is being printed to the console. This means the parser did not find any error. When you change "12*(5-6)" into "12*(5-6" and then recompile and run it, there should be printed the following:Okay, now we want to add a bit of Java code to the grammar so that the parser actually does something useful. Adding code can be done by placing { and } inside your grammar with some plain Java code inside it.But first: all parser rules in the grammar file should return a primitive double value. You can do that by adding returns [double value] after each rule:which needs little explanation: every rule is expected to return a double value. Now to "interact" with the return value double value (which is NOT inside a plain Java code block {...}) from inside a code block, you\'ll need to add a dollar sign in front of value:Here\'s the grammar but now with the Java code added:and since our eval rule now returns a double, change your ANTLRDemo.java into this:Again (re) generate a fresh lexer and parser from your grammar (1), compile all classes (2) and run ANTLRDemo (3):and you\'ll now see the outcome of the expression 12*(5-6) printed to your console!Again: this is a very brief explanation. I encourage you to browse the ANTLR wiki and read some tutorials and/or play a bit with what I just posted.Good luck!EDIT:This post shows how to extend the example above so that a Map<String, Double> can be provided that holds variables in the provided expression.And this Q&A demonstrates how to create a simple expression parser, and evaluator using ANTLR4.To get this code working with a current version of Antlr (June 2014) I needed to make a few changes. ANTLRStringStream needed to become ANTLRInputStream, the returned value needed to change from parser.eval() to parser.eval().value, and I needed to remove the WS clause at the end, because attribute values such as $channel are no longer allowed to appear in lexer actions.For Antlr 4 the java code generation process is below:-Update your jar name in classpath accordingly.
