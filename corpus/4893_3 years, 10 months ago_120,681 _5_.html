What is "ENT" short for?  The error "No such file or directory" should just be named by "ENOFILE".Is there any story or reason?It\'s an abbreviation of Error NO ENTry (or Error NO ENTity), and can actually be used for more than files/directories.It\'s simply \xe2\x80\x9cNo such directory entry\xe2\x80\x9d. Since directory entries can be directories or files (or symlinks, or sockets, or pipes, or devices), the name ENOFILE would have been too narrow in its meaning.
