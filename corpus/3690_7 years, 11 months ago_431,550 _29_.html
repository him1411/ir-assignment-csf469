This question already has an answer here:Typically if we just use alert(object); it will show as [object Object].  How to print all the content parameters of an object in JavaScript?If you are using Firefox, alert(object.toSource()) should suffice for simple debugging purposes.This will give you very nice output with indented JSON object:The second argument alters the contents of the string before returning it. The third argument specifies how many spaces to use as white space for readability.Aside from using a debugger, you can also access all elements of an object using a foreach loop. The following printObject function should alert() your object showing all properties and respective values.Using a DOM inspection tool is preferable because it allows you to dig under the properties that are objects themselves. Firefox has FireBug but all other major browsers (IE, Chrome, Safari) also have debugging tools built-in that you should check.If you just want to have a string representation of an object, you could use the JSON.stringify function, using a JSON library.Print content of object you can useyou can see the result in console like below.For open console press F12 in chrome browser, you will found console tab in debug mode.You should consider using FireBug for JavaScript debugging. It will let you interactively inspect all of your variables, and even step through functions.Use dir(object). Or you can always download Firebug for Firefox (really helpful).You could Node\'s util.inspect(object) to print out object\'s structure. It is especially helpful when your object has circular dependencies e.g.It that case JSON.stringify throws exception: TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSONJavascript for all!You can give your objects their own toString methods in their prototypes.You can use json.js from http://www.json.org/js.html to change json data to string data.You can also use Prototype\'s Object.inspect() method, which "Returns the debug-oriented string representation of the object".http://api.prototypejs.org/language/Object/inspect/Simple function to alert contents of an object or an array .\nCall this function with an array or string or an object it alerts the contents.FunctionUsageInternet Explorer 8 has developer tools which is similar to Firebug for Firefox. Opera has Opera DragonFly, and Google Chrome also has something called Developer Tools (Shift+Ctrl+J).Here is more a more detailed answer to debug JavaScript in IE6-8:\nUsing the IE8 'Developer Tools' to debug earlier IE versionsI faced similar problem, The reason for it was i make use of ajax to fetch data.\nIn this case i had made two asynchronous ajax call. In one i just return string msg and show in alert. In second ajax call i fetch arraylist in json format and decode it in js.\nSo my second request use to process first and i was getting alert of object.So just check.\n1. alert should contain string.\n2. If u get arrayList or any other Object decode it.All the best!
