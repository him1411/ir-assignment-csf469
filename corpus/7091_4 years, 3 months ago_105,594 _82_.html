How to create a "more" button when user swipe a cell in table view (like mail app in ios 7)I have been looking for this information both here and in the Cocoa Touch forum, but I cannot seem to find the answer and I am hoping someone smarter than myself can give me a solution.I would like that when the user swipes a table view cell, to display more than one editing button (he default is the delete button).\nIn the Mail app for iOS 7 you can swipe to delete, but there is a "MORE" button that shows up.It looks like iOS 8 opens up this API. Hints of such functionality are present in Beta 2. To get something working, implement the following two methods on your UITableView\'s delegate to get the desired effect (see gist for an example).The documentation says tableView:commitEditingStyle:forRowAtIndexPath is:"Not called for edit actions using UITableViewRowAction - the action\'s handler will be invoked instead."However, the swiping doesn\'t work without it. Even if the method stub is blank, it still needs it, for now. This is most obviously a bug in beta 2.https://twitter.com/marksands/status/481642991745265664\nhttps://gist.github.com/marksands/76558707f583dbb8f870Original Answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/24540538/870028Sample code with this working (In Swift): http://dropbox.com/s/0fvxosft2mq2v5m/DeleteRowExampleSwift.zipThe sample code contains this easy-to-follow method in MasterViewController.swift, and with just this method you get the behavior shown in the OP screenshot:I have created a new library to implement swippable buttons which supports a variety of transitions and expandable buttons like iOS 8 mail app.https://github.com/MortimerGoro/MGSwipeTableCellThis library is compatible with all the different ways to create a UITableViewCell and its tested on iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7 and iOS 8.Here a sample of some transitions:Border transition:Clip transition3D Transition:iOS 8 opened up this API.To get this working working, implement the following two methods on your UITableView\'s delegate to get the desired effect (see code for an example).The UITableView.h file says the following regarding tableView:commitEditingStyle:forRowAtIndexPath:"Not called for edit actions using UITableViewRowAction - the action\'s handler will be invoked instead."However, the swiping isn\'t enabled without it. This seems to be a bug.https://twitter.com/marksands/status/481642991745265664\nhttps://gist.github.com/marksands/76558707f583dbb8f870This is based off the default Master-Detail Application template (it is in Swift): http://dropbox.com/s/0fvxosft2mq2v5m/DeleteRowExampleSwift.zipJohnny\'s answer is the right one to upvote. I\'m just adding this below in objective-c to make it clearer to beginners (and those of us who refuse to learn Swift syntax :)Make sure you declare the uitableviewdelegate and have the following methods:This is (rather ridiculously) a private API.The following two methods are private and sent to the UITableView\'s delegate:They are pretty self explanatory.I hope you cant wait till apple gives you what ever you need right? So here is my option.Create a custom cell. Have two uiviews in it In lower view, add what ever buttons you need. Deal its actions just \n    like any other IBActions. you can decide the animation time, style and anything.now add a uiswipegesture to the upper view and reveal your lower view on swipe gesture. I have done this before and its the simplest option as far as I am concerned.Hope that help.To improve on Johnny\'s answer, this can now be done using the public API as follows :This is not possible using the standard SDK. However there are various 3rd party solutions that more or less imitate the behavior in Mail.app. Some of them (e.g. MCSwipeTableViewCell, DAContextMenuTableViewController, RMSwipeTableViewCell) detect swipes using gesture recognizers, some of them (e.g. SWTableViewCell) put a second UISScrollView below the standard UITableViewCellScrollView (private subview of UITableViewCell) and some of them modify the behavior of UITableViewCellScrollView. I like the last approach most since the touch handling feels most natural. Specifically, MSCMoreOptionTableViewCell is good. Your choice may vary depending on your specific needs (whether you need a left-to-right pan, too, whether you need iOS 6 compatibility, etc.). Also be aware that most of these approaches come with a burden: they can easily break in a future iOS version if Apple makes changes in the UITableViewCell subview hierarchy.You need to subclass UITableViewCell and subclass method willTransitionToState:(UITableViewCellStateMask)state which is called whenever user swipes the cell. The state flags will let you know if the Delete button is showing, and show/hide your More button there. Unfortunately this method gives you neither the width of the Delete button nor the animation time. So you need to observer & hard-code your More button\'s frame and animation time into your code (I personally think Apple needs to do something about this).Swift 3 version code without using any library:For swift programmingTHIS COULD HELP YOU OUT.I was looking to add the same functionality to my app, and after going through so many different tutorials (raywenderlich being the best DIY solution), I found out that Apple has its own UITableViewRowActionclass, which is very handy. You have to change the Tableview\'s boilerpoint method to this:You can find out more about this on This Site. Apple\'s own documentation is really useful for changing the background colour: The background color of the action button.Declaration OBJECTIVE-C @property(nonatomic, copy) UIColor\n  *backgroundColor Discussion Use this property to specify the background color for your button. If you do not specify a value for\n  this property, UIKit assigns a default color based on the value in the\n  style property.Availability Available in iOS 8.0 and later.If you want to change the font of the button, it\'s a bit more tricky. I\'ve seen another post on SO. For the sake of providing the code as well as the link, here\'s the code they used there. You\'d have to change the appearance of the button. You\'d have to make a specific reference to tableviewcell, otherwise you\'d change the button\'s appearance throughout your app (I didn\'t want that, but you might, I don\'t know :) )Objective C: Swift:This is the easiest, and most stream-lined version IMHO. Hope it helps.Update: Here\'s the Swift 3.0 version:Actual Swift 3 AnswerThis is the ONLY function you need. You do not need CanEdit or CommitEditingStyle functions for custom actions.Here\'s a somewhat fragile way of doing it that does not involve private APIs or constructing your own system.  You\'re hedging your bets that Apple doesn\'t break this and that hopefully they will release an API that you can replace these few lines of code with.This also requires that you implement the standard table view editing delegate callbacks.Here is one simple solution. It is capable to display and hide custom UIView inside UITableViewCell. \nDisplaying logic is contained inside class extended from UITableViewCell, BaseTableViewCell.BaseTableViewCell.h BaseTableViewCell.MTo get this functionality, simple extend your table view cell from BaseTableViewCell.Next,\nInside UIViewController, which implement UITableViewDelegate, create two gesture recognizers to handle left and right swipes.Than add two swipe handlersNow, inside cellForRowAtIndexPath, of UITableViewDelegate, you can create custom UIView and attach it to the dequeued cell.Of course, this way of loading of custom UIView is just for this example. Manage it as you want.There is an amazing library called SwipeCellKit, it should gain more acknowledgement. In my opinion it is cooler than MGSwipeTableCell. The latter doesn\'t completely replicate the behavior of the Mail app\'s cells whereas SwipeCellKit does. Have a lookAs of iOS 11 this is publicly available in UITableViewDelegate. Here\'s some sample code:Also available:- (UISwipeActionsConfiguration *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView leadingSwipeActionsConfigurationForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;Docs: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableviewdelegate/2902367-tableview?language=objc
