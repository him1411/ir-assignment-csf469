Is there a function to make a copy of a PHP array to another?I have been burned a few times trying to copy PHP arrays. I want to copy an array defined inside an object to a global outside it.In PHP arrays are assigned by copy, while objects are assigned by reference. This means that:Will yield:Whereas:Yields:You could get confused by intricacies such as ArrayObject, which is an object that acts exactly like an array. Being an object however, it has reference semantics.Edit: @AndrewLarsson raises a point in the comments below. PHP has a special feature called "references". They are somewhat similar to pointers in languages like C/C++, but not quite the same. If your array contains references, then while the array itself is passed by copy, the references will still resolve to the original target. That\'s of course usually the desired behaviour, but I thought it was worth mentioning.PHP will copy the array by default. References in PHP have to be explicit. If you have an array that contains objects, you need to make a copy of that array without touching its internal pointer, and you need all the objects to be cloned (so that you\'re not modifying the originals when you make changes to the copied array), use this.The trick to not touching the array\'s internal pointer is to make sure you\'re working with a copy of the array, and not the original array (or a reference to it), so using a function parameter will get the job done (thus, this is a function that takes in an array).Note that you will still need to implement __clone() on your objects if you\'d like their properties to also be cloned.This function works just as well for any type of array (including mixed type).When you doPHP copies the array, so I\'m not sure how you would have gotten burned.  For your case,should work fine.In order to get burned, I would think you\'d either have to have been using references or expecting objects inside the arrays to be cloned.array_merge() is a function in which you can copy one array to another in PHP.If you have only basic types in your array you can do this:You won\'t need to update the references manually\nI know it won\'t work for everyone, but it worked for mesimple and makes deep copy breaking all linksSince this wasn\'t covered in any of the answers and is now available in PHP 5.3 (assumed Original Post was using 5.2).In order to maintain an array structure and change its values I prefer to use array_replace or array_replace_recursive depending on my use case.http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-replace.phpHere is an example using array_replace and array_replace_recursive demonstrating it being able to maintain the indexed order and capable of removing a reference.http://ideone.com/SzlBUZThe code below is written using the short array syntax available since PHP 5.4 which replaces array() with [].\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.phpWorks on either offset indexed and name indexed arrays Output:I know this as long time ago, but this worked for me..This is the way I am copying my arrays in Php:This outputs:Define this:Copy $_ARRAY to $_ARRAY2 :Safest and cheapest way I found is:This has also the benefit to reindex the array. This will not work as expected on associative array (hash), but neither most of previous answer.In php array, you need to just assign them to other variable to get copy of that array. But first you need to make sure about it\'s type, whether it is array or arrayObject or stdObject.For Simple php array :
