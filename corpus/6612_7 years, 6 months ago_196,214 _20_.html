In the R scripting language, how do I write lines of text, e.g. the following two linesto a file named "output.txt"?Actually you can do it with sink():hence do:I would use the cat() command as in this example:You can then view the results from with R withWhat\'s about a simple writeLines()?or1.Using file argument in cat.2.Use sink function to redirect all output from both print and cat to file.NOTE: The print function cannot redirect its output, but the sink function can\nforce all output to a file. 3.Making connection to a file and writing.You could do that in a single statementTo round out the possibilities, you can use writeLines() with sink(), if you want:  To me, it always seems most intuitive to use print(), but if you do that the output won\'t be what you want:  Based on the best answer:Note that the yourObject needs to be in a string format; use as.character() to convert if you need.But this is too much typing for every save attempt. Let\'s create a snippet in RStudio.In Global Options >> Code >> Snippet, type this:Then, during coding, type wfile and press Tab.
