I am dealing with dates in Python and I need to convert them to UTC timestamps to be used\ninside Javascript. The following code does not work:Converting the date object first to datetime also does not help. I tried the example at this link from, but:and now either:ordoes work.So general question: how can I get a date converted to seconds since epoch according to UTC?If d = date(2011, 1, 1) is in UTC:If d is in local timezone:timestamp1 and timestamp2 may differ if midnight in the local timezone is not the same time instance as midnight in UTC.mktime() may return a wrong result if d corresponds to an ambiguous local time (e.g., during DST transition) or if d is a past(future) date when the utc offset might have been different and the C mktime() has no access to the tz database on the given platform. You could use pytz module (e.g., via tzlocal.get_localzone()) to get access to the tz database on all platforms. Also, utcfromtimestamp() may fail and mktime() may return non-POSIX timestamp if "right" timezone is used.To convert datetime.date object that represents date in UTC without calendar.timegm():To convert datetime.datetime (not datetime.date) object that already represents time in UTC to the corresponding POSIX timestamp (a float).datetime.timestamp():Note: It is necessary to supply timezone.utc explicitly otherwise .timestamp() assume that your naive datetime object is in local timezone.From the docs for datetime.utcfromtimestamp():There is no method to obtain the timestamp from a datetime instance,\n  but POSIX timestamp corresponding to a datetime instance dt can be\n  easily calculated as follows. For a naive dt:And for an aware dt:Interesting read: Epoch time vs. time of day on the difference between What time is it? and How many seconds have elapsed?See also: datetime needs an "epoch" methodTo adapt the above code for Python 2:where timedelta.total_seconds() is equivalent to (td.microseconds + (td.seconds + td.days * 24 * 3600) * 10**6) / 10**6 computed with true division enabled.Beware of floating-point issues.On Python 3:On Python 2:Assumption 1: You\'re attempting to convert a date to a timestamp, however since a date covers a 24 hour period, there isn\'t a single timestamp that represents that date. I\'ll assume that you want to represent the timestamp of that date at midnight (00:00:00.000).Assumption 2: The date you present is not associated with a particular time zone, however you want to determine the offset from a particular time zone (UTC). Without knowing the time zone the date is in, it isn\'t possible to calculate a timestamp for a specific time zone. I\'ll assume that you want to treat the date as if it is in the local system time zone.First, you can convert the date instance into a tuple representing the various time components using the timetuple() member:You can then convert that into a timestamp using time.mktime:You can verify this method by testing it with the epoch time itself (1970-01-01), in which case the function should return the timezone offset for the local time zone on that date:28800.0 is 8 hours, which would be correct for the Pacific time zone (where I\'m at).For unix systems only:Note: @dizzyf observed that this applies localized timezones. Don\'t use in production.follow the python2.7 document, you have to use calendar.timegm() instead of time.mktime()the question is a little confused.  timestamps are not UTC - they\'re a Unix thing.  the date might be UTC?  assuming it is, and if you\'re using Python 3.2+, simple-date makes this trivial:if you actually have the year, month and day you don\'t need to create the date:and if the date is in some other timezone (this matters because we\'re assuming midnight without an associated time):[the idea behind simple-date is to collect all python\'s date and time stuff in one consistent class, so you can do any conversion.  so, for example, it will also go the other way:]Using the arrow package:A complete time-string contains:For example:1970-01-01 06:00:00 +0500 == 1970-01-01 01:00:00 +0000 == UNIX timestamp:3600Note: UNIX timestamp is a floating point number expressed in seconds since the epoch, in UTC.Edit:
