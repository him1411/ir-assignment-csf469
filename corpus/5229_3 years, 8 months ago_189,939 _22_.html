What is the best way to convert a java.util.Date object to the new JDK 8/JSR-310 java.time.LocalDate?Short answerExplanationDespite its name, java.util.Date represents an instant on the time-line, not a "date". The actual data stored within the object is a long count of milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00Z (midnight at the start of 1970 GMT/UTC).The equivalent class to java.util.Date in JSR-310 is Instant, thus there is a convenient method toInstant() to provide the conversion:A java.util.Date instance has no concept of time-zone. This might seem strange if you call toString() on a java.util.Date, because the toString is relative to a time-zone. However that method actually uses Java\'s default time-zone on the fly to provide the string. The time-zone is not part of the actual state of java.util.Date.An Instant also does not contain any information about the time-zone. Thus, to convert from an Instant to a local date it is necessary to specify a time-zone. This might be the default zone - ZoneId.systemDefault() - or it might be a time-zone that your application controls, such as a time-zone from user preferences. Use the atZone() method to apply the time-zone:A ZonedDateTime contains state consisting of the local date and time, time-zone and the offset from GMT/UTC. As such the date - LocalDate - can be easily extracted using toLocalDate():Java 9 answerIn Java SE 9, a new method has been added that slightly simplifies this task:This new alternative is more direct, creating less garbage, and thus should perform better.Better way is:Advantages of this version:works regardless the input is an instance of java.util.Date or it\'s subclass java.sql.Date (unlike @JodaStephen\'s way). This is common with JDBC originated data. java.sql.Date.toInstant() always throws an exception.it\'s the same for JDK8 and JDK7 with JSR-310 backportI personally use an utility class (but this is not backport-compatible):The asLocalDate() method here is null-safe, uses toLocalDate(), if input is java.sql.Date (it may be overriden by the JDBC driver to avoid timezone problems or unnecessary calculations), otherwise uses the abovementioned method.If you\'re using Java 8, @JodaStephen\'s answer is obviously the best.  However, if you\'re working with the JSR-310 backport, you unfortunately have to do something like this:I have had problems with @JodaStephen\'s implementation on JBoss EAP 6. So, I rewrote the conversion following Oracle\'s Java Tutorial in http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/iso/legacy.html.this format is from Date#tostringI solved this question with solution belowIn this case localDate print your date in this format "yyyy-MM-dd"
