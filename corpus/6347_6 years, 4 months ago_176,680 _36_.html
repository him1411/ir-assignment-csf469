I\'ve reduced my code to the simplest express-js app I could make:My directory look like this:Yet when I access http://localhost:3001/styles/default.css I get the following error:I\'m using express 2.3.3 and node 0.4.7. What am I doing wrong?Try http://localhost:3001/default.css.To have /styles in your request URL, use:Look at the examples on this page:I have the same problem. I have resolved the problem with following code:Static request example:I need a more simple solution. Does it exist?default.css should be available at http://localhost:3001/default.cssThe styles in app.use(express.static(__dirname + \'/styles\')); just tells express to look in the styles directory for a static file to serve. It doesn\'t (confusingly) then form part of the path it is available on.In your server.js :You have declare express and app separately, create a folder named \'public\' or as you like, and yet you can access to these folder. In your template src, you have put the relative path from /public (or the name of your folder destiny to static files). Beware of the bars on the routes.to serve static files (css,images,js files)just two steps:pass the directory of css files to built in middleware express.staticto access css files or images just type in url http://localhost:port/filename.css ex:http://localhost:8081/bootstrap.cssnote: to link css files to html just type<link href="file_name.css" rel="stylesheet">\nif i write this code to access the static files just type in url:localhost:port/css/filename.css\nex:http://localhost:8081/css/bootstrap.cssnote to link css files with html just add the following lineI found my css file and added added a route to it:Then it seems to work.Try accessing it with http://localhost:3001/default.css.You are actually giving it the name of folder i.e. styles not your suburl.What worked for me is:Instead of writing  app.use(express.static(__dirname + \'public/images\')); in your app.jsSimply write \napp.use(express.static(\'public/images\'));i.e  remove the root directory name in the path. And then you can use the static path effectively in other js files, For example: Hope this helps :)I am using Bootstrap CSS, JS and Fonts in my application. I created a folder called asset in root directory of the app and place all these folder inside it. Then in server file added following line:This line enables me to load the files that are in the asset directory from the /asset path prefix like: http://localhost:3000/asset/css/bootstrap.min.css.Now in the views I can simply include CSS and JS like below:this one worked for meThis work for me:In addition to above, make sure the static file path begins with /  (ex... /assets/css)... to serve static files in any directory above the main directory (/main)
