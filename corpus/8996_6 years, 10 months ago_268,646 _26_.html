If I have PHP script, how can I get the filename from inside that script?Also, given the name of a script of the form jquery.js.php, how can I extract just the "jquery.js" part?Just use the PHP magic constant __FILE__ to get the current filename.But it seems you want the part without .php. So...A more generic file extension remover would look like this...Using standard string library functions is much quicker, as you\'d expect.When you want your include to know what file it is in (ie. what script name was actually requested), use:Because when you are writing to a file you usually know its name.Edit: As noted by Alec Teal, if you use symlinks it will show the symlink name instead.see http://php.net/manual/en/function.pathinfo.phpHere is the difference between basename(__FILE__, ".php") and basename($_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\'], ".php").basename(__FILE__, ".php") shows the name of the file where this code is included - It means that if you include this code in header.php and current page is index.php, it will return header not index.basename($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"], ".php") - If you use include this code in header.php  and current page is index.php, it will return index not header.This might help:it will work even if you are using include.alex\'s answer is correct but you could also do this without regular expressions like so:you can also use this:Here is a list what I\'ve found recently searching an answer:Don\'t forget to remove :)<br>A more general way would be using pathinfo(). Since Version 5.2 it supports PATHINFO_FILENAME.Sowill also do what you need.__FILE__ use examples based on localhost server results:As some said basename($_SERVER["SCRIPT_FILENAME"], \'.php\') and basename( __FILE__, \'.php\') are good ways to test this. To me using the second was the solution for some validation instructions I was making
