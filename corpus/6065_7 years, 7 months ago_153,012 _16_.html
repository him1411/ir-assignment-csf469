SQL Server Management Studio always inserts a GO command when I create a query using the right click "Script As" menu.  Why?  What does GO actually do?It is a batch terminator, you can however change it to whatever you want \nSince Management Studio 2005 it seems that you can use GO with an int parameter, like:The above will insert 10 rows into mytable. Generally speaking, GO will execute the related sql commands n times.The GO command isn\'t a Transact-SQL statement, but a special command recognized by several MS utilities including SQL Server Management Studio code editor.The GO command is used to group SQL commands into batches which are sent to the server together.  The commands included in the batch, that is, the set of commands since the last GO command or the start of the session, must be logically consistent.  For example, you can\'t define a variable in one batch and then use it in another since the scope of the variable is limited to the batch in which it\'s defined.For more information, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188037.aspx.GO is not a SQL keyword.It\'s a batch separator used by client tools (like SSMS) to break the entire script up into batchesAnswered before several times... example 1Code says to execute the instructions above the GO marker.\nMy default database is myDatabase, so instead of using myDatabase GO and makes current query to use herDatabaseJust to add to the existing answers, when you are creating views you must separate these commands into batches using go, otherwise you will get the error \'CREATE VIEW\' must be the only statement in the batch. So, for example, you won\'t be able to execute the following sql script without goHere is the magic of GO. SYNTAX : Go INT (BatchNumber)BatchNumber: No of times occurred Looks simple,It might lead you to Spaghetti if you code deeper.
