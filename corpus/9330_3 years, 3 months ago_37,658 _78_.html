Many languages support documentation comments to allow a generator (like javadoc or doxygen), generate the code documentation by parsing the same code.Does Swift have any type documentation comments or documentation generation tools?Documentation comments are supported natively in Xcode, producing smartly rendered documentation in Quick Help (both in the popover when ⌥-clicking symbols, and in the Quick Help Inspector ⌥⌘2).Symbol documentation comments are now based on the same Markdown syntax used by rich playground comments, so a lot of what you can do in playgrounds can now be used directly in source code documentation.For full details of the syntax, see Markup Formatting Reference. Note that there are some discrepancies between the syntax for rich playground comments & symbol documentation; these are pointed out in the document (e.g. block quotes can only be used in playgrounds).Below is an example and a list of the syntax elements that currently work for symbol documentation comments.Xcode 7 beta 4 ~ Added "- Throws: ..." as a top-level list item which appears alongside parameters and return descriptions in Quick Help.Xcode 7 beta 1 ~ Some significant changes to syntax with Swift 2 - documentation comments now based on Markdown (same as playgrounds).Xcode 6.3 (6D570) ~ Indented text is now formatted as code blocks, with subsequent indentations being nested. It doesn\'t appear to be possible to leave a blank line in such a code block - trying to do so results in the text being tacked onto the end of the last line with any characters in it.Xcode 6.3 beta ~ Inline code can now be added to documentation comments using backticks.Both /// (inline) and /** */ (block) style comments are supported for producing documentation comments. While I personally prefer the visual style of /** */ comments, Xcode\'s automatic indentation can ruin formatting for this comment style when copying/pasting as it removes leading whitespace. For example:When pasting, the code block indentation is removed and it is no longer rendered as code:For this reason, I generally use ///, and will use it for the rest of the examples in this answer.Heading:or \nSubheading:or\nHorizontal rule:\nUnordered (bulleted) lists:You can also use + or * for unordered lists, it just has to be consistent.\nOrdered (numbered) lists:\nCode blocks:An indentation of at least four spaces is required.Emphasis (italics):\nStrong (bold):Note that you cannot mix asterisks (*) and underscores (_) on the same element.\nInline code:\nLinks:\nImages:The URL can be either a web URL (using "http://") or an absolute file path URL (I can\'t seem to get relative file paths to work).The URLs for links and images can also be separated from the inline element in order to keep all URLs in one, manageable place:In addition to the Markdown formatting, Xcode recognises other markup keywords to display prominently in Quick Help. These markup keywords mostly take the format - <keyword>: (the exception is parameter, which also includes the parameter name before the colon), where the keyword itself can be written with any combination of uppercase/lowercase characters.The following keywords are displayed as prominent sections in the help viewer, below the "Description" section, and above the "Declared In" section. When included, their order is fixed as displayed below even though you can include them in whatever order you like in your comments.See the fully documented list of section keywords and their intended uses in the Symbol Section Commands section of the Markup Formatting Reference.Alternatively, you can write each parameter this way:The following list of keywords are displayed as bold headings in the body of the "Description" section of the help viewer. They will appear in whatever order you write them in, as with the rest of the "Description" section.Full list paraphrased from this excellent blog article by Erica Sadun. Also see the fully documented list of keywords and their intended uses in the Symbol Description Field Commands section of the Markup Formatting Reference.Attributions:Availability:Admonitions:Development State:Implementation Qualities:Functional Semantics:Cross Reference:HTML documentation (designed to mimic Apple\'s own documentation) can be generated from inline documentation using Jazzy, an open-source command-line utility.Console example taken from this NSHipster articleHere are some things that work for documenting swift code in Xcode 6. It is very buggy and sensitive to colons, but it\'s better than nothing:The above is rendered in Quick Help as you would expect with formatted numeric lists, bullet points, parameter and return value documentation.None of this is documented - file a Radar to help them along.Swift includes "///" comment handling (although probably not everything yet).Write something like:Then option-click on the func name and voil\xc3\xa0 :)New in Xcode 8, you can select a method like thisThen press command + option + / or choose "Structure" - "Add documentation" from Xcode\'s "Editor" menu, and it will generate the following comments template for you:I can confirm that ShakenManChild has provided peopr solutionJust make sure, you have an empty line below the description!If you\'re only using Swift then Jazzy is worth looking at.https://github.com/realm/jazzyYes. Base common (I made snippets for it with Obj-C equivalent)Objective-C:SwiftI\'ve found something interesting, digging in the Xcode binary. Files with the ending .swiftdoc.\nIt definitely has docs, because these files contain the docs for the Swift UIKit / Foundation API, unfortunately it seems to be a proprietary file format, for use in the Documentation viewer in Xcode.You can do Literate Programming in Swift with Docco.In Xcode  Editor -> Structure -> Add Documentation.Maybe it\'s a good idea to have an eye on AppleDoc or Apple\'s own HeaderDoc which isn\'t recognized very much.\nI can still find some HeaderDoc hints in 10.9 Mavericks terminal (headerdoc2html)I recommend to read the latest "What\'s New In Xcode"* (not sure if it\'s still under NDA)\n*The link points to the Xcode 5.1 version wich contains infos about HeaderDoc too.As of Xcode 5.0, Doxygen and HeaderDoc structured comments are supported.Source
