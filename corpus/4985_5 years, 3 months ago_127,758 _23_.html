In a Git repository, how to properly rename a directory? I think it should work to copy the directory to be renamed to a new directory with desired name, and delete the old directory, and git add,  git commit and push everything.  But is this the best way?Basic rename (or move):Case sensitive rename\xe2\x80\x94eg. from casesensitive to CaseSensitive\xe2\x80\x94you must use a two step:(More about case sensitivity in Git\xe2\x80\xa6)\xe2\x80\xa6followed by commit and push would be the simplest way to rename a directory in a git repo.If you receive this error: fatal: renaming \xe2\x80\x98foldername\xe2\x80\x99 failed: Invalid argumentTry this:git mv foldername tempname && git mv tempname folderName1. Change a folder\'s name from oldfolder to newfolder2. If newfolder is already in your repository & you\'d like to override it and use:- forceDon\'t forget to add the changes to index & commit them after renaming with git mv.3. Renaming foldername to folderName on case insensitive file systemsSimple renaming with a normal mv command(not git mv) won\xe2\x80\x99t get recognized as a filechange from git. If you try it with the \xe2\x80\x98git mv\xe2\x80\x99 command like in the following lineIf you\xe2\x80\x99re using a case insensitive filesystem, e.g. you\xe2\x80\x99re on a Mac and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t configure it to be case sensitive, you\xe2\x80\x99ll experience an error message like this one:fatal: renaming \xe2\x80\x98foldername\xe2\x80\x99 failed: Invalid argumentAnd here is what you can do in order to make it work:-This splits up the renaming process by renaming the folder at first to a completely different foldername. After renaming it to the different foldername the folder can finally be renamed to the new folderName. After those \xe2\x80\x98git mv\xe2\x80\x99s, again, do not forget to add and commit the changes. Though this is probably not a beautiful technique, it works perfectly fine. The filesystem will still not recognize a change of the letter cases, but git does due to renaming it to a new foldername, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all we wanted :)You can rename the directory using the file system. Then you can do git rm <old directory> and git add <new directory> (Help page). Then you can commit and push.Git will detect that the contents are the same and that it\'s just a rename operation, and it\'ll appear as a rename entry in the history. You can check that this is the case before the commit using git statusFrom Web Application I think you can\'t, but you can rename all the folders in Git Client, it will move your files in the new renamed folders, than commit and push to remote repository.I had a very similar issue: \nI had to rename different folders from uppercase to lowercase (like Abc -> abc), I\'ve renamed all the folders with a dummy name (like \'abc___\') and than committed to remote repository, after that I renamed all the folders to the original name with the lowercase (like abc) and it took them! Then re-add and commit.Simply rename the folder. git is a "content-tracker", so the SHA1 hashes are the same and git knows, that you rename it. The only thing that changes is the tree-object.
