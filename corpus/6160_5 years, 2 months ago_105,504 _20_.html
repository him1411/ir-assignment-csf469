I\'m developing an Android 2.3.3 application with a service. I have this inside that service to communicate with Main activity:And here, final Messenger mMessenger = new Messenger(new IncomingHandler());, I get the following Lint warning:This Handler class should be static or leaks might occur: IncomingHandlerWhat does it mean?If IncomingHandler class is not static, it will have a reference to your Service object.Handler objects for the same thread all share a common Looper object, which they post messages to and read from. As messages contain target Handler, as long as there are messages with target handler in the message queue, the handler cannot be garbage collected. If handler is not static, your Service or Activity cannot be garbage collected, even after being destroyed.This may lead to memory leaks, for some time at least - as long as the messages stay int the queue. This is not much of an issue unless you post long delayed messages.You can make IncomingHandler static and have a WeakReference to your service:See this post  by Romain Guy for further referenceAs others have mentioned the Lint warning is because of the potential memory leak. You can avoid the Lint warning by passing a Handler.Callback when constructing Handler (i.e. you don\'t subclass Handler and there is no Handler non-static inner class):As I understand it, this will not avoid the potential memory leak. Message objects hold a reference to the mIncomingHandler object which holds a reference the Handler.Callback object which holds a reference to the Service object. As long as there are messages in the Looper message queue, the Service will not be GC. However, it won\'t be a serious issue unless you have long delay messages in the message queue. Here is a generic example of using a weak reference and static handler class to resolve the problem (as recommended in the Lint documentation):This way worked well for me, keeps code clean by keeping where you handle the message in its own inner class.The handler you wish to useThe inner classI am not sure but you can try intialising handler to null in onDestroy()With the help of @Sogger\'s answer, I created a generic Handler:The interface:I\'m using it as follows. But I\'m not 100% sure if this is leak-safe. Maybe someone could comment on this:
