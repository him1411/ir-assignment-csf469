How can I print a message to the error console, preferably including a variable? For example, something like:Install Firebug and then you can use console.log(...) and console.debug(...), etc. (see the documentation for more).You also can add CSS to your logging messages:Exceptions are logged into the JavaScript console. You can use that if you want to keep Firebug disabled.Usage:One good way to do this that works cross-browser is outlined in Debugging JavaScript: Throw Away Your Alerts!.Here is a solution to the literal question of how to print a message to the browser\'s error console, not the debugger console.  (There might be good reasons to bypass the debugger.)As I noted in comments about the suggestion to throw an error to get a message in the error console, one problem is that this will interrupt the thread of execution.  If you don\'t want to interrupt the thread, you can throw the error in a separate thread, one created using setTimeout.  Hence my solution (which turns out to be an elaboration of the one by Ivo Danihelka):I include the time in milliseconds since the start time because the timeout could skew the order in which you might expect to see the messages.  The second argument to the Error method is for the filename, which is an empty string here to prevent output of the useless filename and line number.  It is possible to get the caller function but not in a simple browser independent way.  It would be nice if we could display the message with a warning or message icon instead of the error icon, but I can\'t find a way to do that.Another problem with using throw is that it could be caught and thrown away by an enclosing try-catch, and putting the throw in a separate thread avoids that obstacle as well.  However, there is yet another way the error could be caught, which is if the window.onerror handler is replaced with one that does something different.  Can\'t help you there.If you use Safari, you can writeand it appears right on the console of the browser.If you are using Firebug and need to support IE, Safari or Opera as well, Firebug Lite adds console.log() support to these browsers.To actually answer the question:Instead of error, you can also use info, log or warn.A note about \'throw()\' mentioned above. It seems that it stops execution of the page completely (I checked in IE8) , so it\'s not very useful for logging "on going processes" (like to track a certain variable...)My suggestion is perhaps to add a textarea element somewhere in your document and to change (or append to) its value (which would change its text) for logging information whenever needed...The WebKit Web Inspector also supports Firebug\'s console API (just a minor addition to Dan\'s answer).As always, InternetÂ Explorer is the big elephant in rollerskates that stops you just simply using console.log().jQuery\'s log can be adapted quite easily, but is a pain having to add it everywhere. One solution if you\'re using jQuery is to put it into your jQuery file at the end, minified first:Visit https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api for a complete console api referenceIn this case, object would be your error stringworking for me.. i\'m searching for this.. i used Firefox.\nhere is my Script.works in Firefox and Chrome.The simplest way to do this is:This does not print to the Console, but will open you an alert Popup with your message which might be useful for some debugging:just do:
