When I define a TextView in xml, how do I add a new line to it? \\n seems not to work.Don\'t trust the Visual editor.\nYour code does work in the emu.Try: android:lines="2"\\n should work.try System.getProperty("line.separator");I think this has something to do with your HTM.fromHtml(subTitle) call: a "\\n" doesn\'t mean bupkis to HTML.  Try <br/> instead of "\\n".First, put this in your textview:Then use \\n in the text of your textview.maxLines makes the TextView be at most this many lines tall. You may choose another number :)Tried all the above, did some research of my own resulting in the following solution for rendering line feed escape chars:Using the replace method you need to filter escaped linefeeds (e.g. \'\\\\\\n\')Only then each instance of line feed \'\\n\' escape chars gets rendered into the actual linefeed For this example I used a Google Apps Scripting noSQL database (ScriptDb) with JSON formated data.Cheers :DI think this will work.make sure your \\n is in "\\n" for it to work.This solved my problem.I just solve the same problem, put below attributes in xmlwork.Html.fromHtml("text1 <br> text2").toString() also work.System.getProperty("line.separator"); this work for me.If you debug, you will see that the string is actually "\\ \\r\\ \\n" or "\\ \\n", ie, it is escaped. So if you massage that string, to get rid of the extra \\, you will have your solution. This is true especially if you are reading from a database. Need to keep 1.android:maxLines="no of lines"2.And use \\n for getting of the next LinesAlso you can add  <br> instead of \\n.And then you can add text to TexView:You need to put \\n in the file string.xml One way of doing this is using Html tags::My 2 cents, using Android TV.Add \\n in XML strings, while reading:You need to put the "\\n" in the strings xml file not within the page layout.make sure you are using your_package.R\nand not android.RRuDrA05\'s answer is good, When I edit the XML on eclipse it does not work, but when I edit the XML with notepad++ it DOES work.The same thing is happening if I read a txt file saved with eclipse or notepad++Maybe is related to the encoding.for the new line in TextView just add \\n in middle of your text\nit works..This works fine. Check it for your app. If the TextView is in any Layout (LinearLayout for example), try to change the orientation attribute to vertical as\nandroid:orientation="vertical" for the layout or change the TextView attribute android:singleLine="true" to create a new line after it.Side note: Capitalising text usingandroid:inputType="textCapCharacters"or similar seems to stop the \\n from working.Try this,Use Notepad++ and follow the steps:And you are good to go.
