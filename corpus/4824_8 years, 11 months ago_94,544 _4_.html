I\'m considering either a ListBox or a ListView for a WPF application.  It seems either supports data binding and item templates.  My application has a simple list of items that I intend to be able to search/sort/filter based on user input.  The data binding demo (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms771319.aspx) uses a ListBox with a CollectionViewSource.  Does anyone have pros/cons for which control to use and when?A ListView is a specialized ListBox (that is, it inherits from ListBox).  It allows you to specify different views rather than a straight list. You can either roll your own view, or use GridView (think explorer-like "details view").   It\'s basically the multi-column listbox, the cousin of windows form\'s listview.If you don\'t need the additional capabilities of ListView, you can certainly use ListBox if you\'re simply showing a list of items (Even if the template is complex).
