How can I convert entire MySQL database character-set to UTF-8 and collation to UTF-8?Use the ALTER DATABASE and ALTER TABLE commands.Or if you\'re still on MySQL 5.5.2 or older which didn\'t support 4-byte UTF-8, use utf8 instead of utf8mb4:Make a backup!Then you need to set the default char sets on the database.  This does not convert existing tables, it only sets the default for newly created tables.Then, you will need to convert the char set on all existing tables and their columns.  This assumes that your current data is actually in the current char set.  If your columns are set to one char set but your data is really stored in another then you will need to check the MySQL manual on how to handle this.If you\'re one the commandline shell, you can do this very quickly. Just fill in "dbname" :DYou can create the sql to update all tables with:Capture the output and run it.Arnold Daniels\' answer above is more elegant.Before proceeding, ensure that you: Have completed a full database backup!Step 1: Database Level ChangesIdentifying the Collation and Character set of your databaseFixing the collation for the databaseStep 2: Table Level ChangesIdentifying Database Tables with the incorrect character set or collationAdjusting table columns\' collation and character setCapture upper sql output and run it. (like following)refer to: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+Fix+the+Collation+and+Character+Set+of+a+MySQL+DatabaseUse HeidiSQL. Its free and a very good db tool.From tools menu, enter Bulk table editorSelect the complete database or pick tables to convert,ExecuteThis converts complete database from latin to utf8 in just a few seconds.Works like a charm :)HeidiSQL connects by default as utf8 so any special characters should now be seen as the character (\xc3\xa6 \xc3\xb8 \xc3\xa5) and not as encoded when inspecting the table data.The real pitfall when moving from latin to utf8 is to make sure pdo connects with utf8 charset. If not you will get rubbish data inserted to the utf8 table and question marks all over the place on your web page, making you think the table data is not utf8...For databases that have a high number of tables you can use a simple php script to update the charset of the database and all of the tables using the following: Inspired by @sdfor comment, here is a bash script that does the jobIn case the data is not in the same character set you might consider this snippet from http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-conversion.htmlIf the column has a nonbinary data type (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT), its\n  contents should be encoded in the column character set, not some other\n  character set. If the contents are encoded in a different character\n  set, you can convert the column to use a binary data type first, and\n  then to a nonbinary column with the desired character set.Here is an example:Make sure to choose the right collation, or you might get unique key conflicts.  e.g. \n\xc3\x89leanore and Eleanore might be considered the same in some collations.Aside:I had a situation where certain characters "broke" in emails even though they were stored as UTF-8 in the database.  If you are sending emails using utf8 data, you might want to also convert your emails to send in UTF8.In PHPMailer, just update this line: public $CharSet = \'utf-8\';If you cannot get your tables to convert or your table is always set to some non-utf8 character set, but you want utf8, your best bet might be to wipe it out and start over again and explicitly specify:The only solution that worked for me: http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Converting_your_MySQL_database_to_UTF8alter table table_name charset = \'utf8\';This is a simple query i was able to use for my case, you can change the table_name as per your requirement(s).To change the character set encoding to UTF-8 for the database itself, type the following command at the mysql> prompt. Replace DBNAME with the database name:You can also DB tool Navicat, which does it more easier.Right Click Your Database & select DB Properties & Change as you desired in Drop Down
