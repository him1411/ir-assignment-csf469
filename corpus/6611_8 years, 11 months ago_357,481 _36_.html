What is the best method for removing a table row with jQuery?You\'re right:This works fine if your row has an id, such as:If you don\'t have an id, you can use any of jQuery\'s plethora of selectors.@EikernIf you\'re gonna use jQuery, use jQuery man!Assuming you have a button/link inside of a data cell in your table, something like this would do the trick...This will remove the parent of the parent of the button/link that is clicked. You need to use parent() because it is a jQuery object, not a normal DOM object, and you need to use parent() twice, because the button lives inside a data cell, which lives inside a row....which is what you want to remove. $(this) is the button clicked, so simply having something like this will remove only the button:While this will remove the data cell:If you want to simply click anywhere on the row to remove it something like this would work. You could easily modify this to prompt the user or work only on a double-click:Hope that helps...I struggled on this a bit myself.You can use:for finding the parent table row of an element. It is more elegant than parent().parent() which is what I started out doing and soon learnt the error of my ways.--Edit --\nSomeone pointed out that the question was about removing the row...As pointed out below you can simply do:A similar code snippet can be used for many operations such as firing events on multiple elements.Easy.. Try thisAll you have to do is to remove the table row (<tr>) tag from your table. For example here is the code to remove the last row from the table:$(\'#myTable tr:last\').remove();*Code above was taken from this jQuery Howto post.try this for sizefull listing:see it in actionMaybe something like this could work as well? I haven\'t tried doing something with "this", so I don\'t know if it works or not.Is the following acceptable:Another one by empty() :If the row you want to delete might change you can use this.  Just pass this function the row # you wish to delete.i think you will try the above code, as it work, but i don\'t know why it work for sometime and then the whole table is removed. i am also trying to remove the row by click the row. but could not find exact answer.if you have HTML like this where userid="123" is a custom attribute that you can populate dynamically when you build the table,you can use something like So in that case you don\'t know the class or id of the TR tag but anyway you are able to delete it.I appreciate this is an old post, but I was looking to do the same, and found the accepted answer didn\'t work for me. Assuming JQuery has moved on since this was written.Anyhow, I found the following worked for me:Not sure if this helps anyone. My example above was part of a larger function so not wrapped it in an event listener.
