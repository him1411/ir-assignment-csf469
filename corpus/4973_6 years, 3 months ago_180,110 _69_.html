with"..." will be shown in the end of the line if overflowed.\nHowever, this will be shown only in one line.\nBut I would like it to be shown in multi-lines.It may looks like:There are also several jquery plugins that deal with this issue, but many do not handle multiple lines of text.  Following works:There also some preformance tests.I have hacked around until I\'ve managed to achieve something close to this. It comes with a few caveats:I should also note that the text will be broken at a word boundary, not a character boundary. This was deliberate (since I consider that better for longer texts), but because it\'s different from what text-overflow: ellipsis does, I thought I should mention it.If you can live with these caveats, the HTML looks like this:And this is the corresponding CSS, using the example of a 150 pixel wide box with three lines of text on a white background. It assumes you have a CSS reset or similar that sets margins and paddings to zero where necessary.The result looks like this:To clarify how it works, here\'s the same image, except that .hidedots1 is hightlighted in red, and .hidedots2 in cyan. These are the rectangles that hide the ellipsis when there\'s no invisible text:Tested in IE9, IE8 (emulated), Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. Does not work in IE7.Here\'s a recent css-tricks article which discusses this.Some of the solutions in the above article (which are not mentioned here) are1) -webkit-line-clamp and 2) Place an absolutely positioned element to the bottom right with fade outBoth methods assume the following markup:with cssline-clamp FIDDLE (..for a maximum of 3 lines)Let\'s say you set the line-height to 1.2em. If we want to expose\n  three lines of text, we can just make the height of the container\n  3.6em (1.2em \xc3\x97 3). The hidden overflow will hide the rest.Fade out FIDDLEWe can use @supports to apply webkit\'s line-clamp on webkit browsers and apply fade out in other browsers.@supports line-clamp with fade fallback fiddle The link below provides a pure HTML / CSS solution to this problem.Browser support - as stated in the article:So far we have tested on Safari 5.0, IE 9 (must be in standards mode),\n  Opera 12 and Firefox 15.Older browsers will still work quite well, as the meat of the layout\n  is in normal positioning, margin and padding properties. if your\n  platform is older (e.g. Firefox 3.6, IE 8), you can use the method but\n  redo the gradient as a standalone PNG image or DirectX filter.http://www.mobify.com/dev/multiline-ellipsis-in-pure-css(resize browser\'s window for testing)After looking over the W3 spec for text-overflow, I don\'t think this is possible using only CSS.  Ellipsis is a new-ish property, so it probably hasn\'t received much usage or feedback as of yet.However, this guy appears to have asked a similar (or identical) question, and someone was able to come up with a nice jQuery solution.  You can demo the solution here: http://jsfiddle.net/MPkSF/If javascript is not an option, I think you may be out of luck...Just want to add to this question for completeness sake. Great question... I wish there was an answer, but this is the closest you can get with CSS these days. No ellipsis, but still pretty usable.I\'ve found this css (scss) solution that works quite well. On webkit browsers it shows the ellipsis and on other browsers it just truncates the text. Which is fine for my intended use.An example by the creator: http://codepen.io/martinwolf/pen/qlFdpIn your case, the following shall be efficient and enough.Here is the closest solution I could get using just css.I hope now some css expert would have got idea on how to make it perfect. :)Bit late to this party but I came up with, what I think, is a unique solution. Rather than trying to insert your own ellipsis through css trickery or js I thought i\'d try and roll with the single line only restriction. So I duplicate the text for every "line" and just use a negative text-indent to make sure one line starts where the last one stops. FIDDLECSS:HTML:More details in the fiddle. There is an issue with the browser reflowing that I use a JS redraw for and such so do check it out but this is the basic concept. Any thoughts/suggestions are much appreciated.thanks @balpha and @Kevin, I combine two method together. no js needed in this method.you can use background-image and no gradient needed to hide dots.the innerHTML of .ellipsis-placeholder is not necessary, I use .ellipsis-placeholder to keep the same width and height with .ellipsis-more.\nYou could use display: inline-block instead.jsfiddlerjavascript solution will be betterElement.getClientRects() works like thiseach rects in the same row has the same top value, so find out the rects with different top value, like thislike thislike thisThere are many answers here but I needed one that was:The caveat is that it doesn\'t provide an ellipsis for the browsers that don\'t support the -webkit-line-clamp rule (currently IE, Edge, Firefox) but it does use a gradient to fade their text out.You can see it in action in this CodePen and you can also see a Javascript version here (no jQuery).see more click herea pure css method base on -webkit-line-clamp:I found a javascript trick, but you have to use the length of the string. Lets say you want 3 lines of width 250px, you can calculate the length per line i.e.
