For example I have two dicts:I need a pythonic way of \'combining\' two dicts such that the result is :That is to say: if a key appears in both dicts, add their values, if it appears in only one dict, keep its value.Use collections.Counter:Counters are basically a subclass of dict, so you can still do everything else with them you\'d normally do with that type, such as iterate over their keys and values.A more generic solution, which works for non-numeric values as well:or even more generic:For example:Intro:\nThere are the (probably) best solutions. But you have to know it and remember it and sometimes you have to hope that your Python version isn\'t too old or whatever the issue could be.Then there are the most \'hacky\' solutions. They are great and short but sometimes are hard to understand, to read and to remember.There is, though, an alternative which is to to try to reinvent the wheel.\n- Why reinventing the wheel?\n- Generally because it\'s a really good way to learn (and sometimes just because the already-existing tool doesn\'t do exactly what you would like and/or the way you would like it) and the easiest way if you don\'t know or don\'t remember the perfect tool for your problem.So, I propose to reinvent the wheel of the Counter class from the collections module (partially at least):There would probably others way to implement that and there are already tools to do that but it\'s always nice to visualize how things would basically works.The one with no extra imports!Their is a pythonic standard called EAFP(Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission). Below code is based on that python standard.EDIT: thanks to jerzyk for his improvement suggestions.OR Alternative you can use Counter as @Martijn has mentioned above.For a more generic and extensible way check mergedict. It uses singledispatch and can merge values based on its types.Example:Definitely summing the Counter()s is the most pythonic way to go in such cases but only if it results in a positive value. Here is an example and as you can see there is no c in result after negating the c\'s value in B dictionary.That\'s because Counters were primarily designed to work with positive integers to represent running counts (negative count is meaningless). But to help with those use cases,python documents the minimum range and type restrictions as follows:So for getting around that problem after summing your Counter you can use Counter.update in order to get the desire output. It works like dict.update() but adds counts instead of replacing them.You could easily generalize this:Then it can take any number of dicts.Here is my way:This solution is easy to use, it is used as a normal dictionary, but you can use the sum function.This is a simple solution for merging two dictionaries where += can be applied to the values, it has to iterate over a dictionary only once, I\'m surprised no one has suggested thisThe above solutions are great for the scenario where you have a small number of Counters. If you have a big list of them though, something like this is much nicer:The above solution is essentially summing the Counters by:This does the same thing but I think it always helps to see what it is effectively doing underneath.Additionally, please note a.update( b ) is 2x faster than a + bThe best to use is dict():
