I\'m using Angular UI Router and would like to reload the current state and refresh all data / re-run the controllers for the current state and it\'s parent.I have 3 state levels: directory.organisations.detailsdirectory.organisations contains a table with a list of organisations. Clicking on an item in the table loads directory.organisations.details with $StateParams passing the ID of the item. So in the details state I load the details for this item, edit them and then save data. All fine so far. Now I need to reload this state and refresh all the data.I have tried:Which goes to the parent state but doesn\'t reload the controller, I guess because the path hasn\'t changed. Ideally I just want to stay in the directory.organisations.details state and refresh all data in the parent too.I have also tried:I have seen this on the API WIKI for $state.reload "(bug with controllers reinstantiating right now, fixing soon)."Any help would be appreciated?I found this to be the shortest working way to refresh with ui-router:Update for newer versions: Which is an alias for:Documentation: https://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router.state.$state#methods_reloadThis solution works in AngularJS V.1.2.2:That would be the final solution. (inspired by @Hollan_Risley\'s post)Now, whenever you need to reload, simply call:for ionic frameworkhttps://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/582Probably the cleaner approach would be the following :We can reload the state from the HTML only.@Holland Risley \'s answer is now available as an api in latest ui-router.A method that force reloads the current state. All resolves are\n  re-resolved, controllers reinstantiated, and events re-fired.http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router.state.$stateif you want to reload your entire page, like it seems, just inject $window into your controller and then callbut if you only want to reload your current view, inject $scope, $state and $stateParams (the latter just in case you need to have some parameters change in this upcoming reload, something like your page number), then call this within any controller method: AngularJS v1.3.15\nangular-ui-router v0.2.15 For angular v1.2.26, none of the above works. An ng-click that calls the above methods will have to be clicked twice in order to make the state reload.So I ended up emulating 2 clicks using $timeout.Everything failed for me. Only thing that worked...is adding cache-view="false" into the view which I want to reload when going to it.from this issue https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/582Silly workaround that always works.Not sure why none of these seemed to work for me; the one that finally did it was:This was with Angular 1.4.0I had multiple nested views and the goal was to reload only one with content.\nI tried different approaches but the only thing that worked for me is:In this case only needed view would be reloaded and caching would still work.I know there have been a bunch of answers but the best way I have found to do this without causing a full page refresh is to create a dummy parameter on the route that I want to refresh and then when I call the route I pass in a random number to the dummy paramter.and then the call to that routeWorks like a charm and handles the resolves.You can use @Rohan answer  https://stackoverflow.com/a/23609343/3297761But if you want to make each controller reaload after a view change you can useI had this problem it was wrecking my head, my routing is read from a JSON file and then fed into a directive. I could click on a ui-state but I couldn\'t reload the page. So a collegue of mine showed me a nice little trick for it.This worked for me.Hope it helpsIf you are using ionic v1, the above solution won\'t work since ionic has enabled template caching as part of $ionicConfigProvider.Work around for that is a bit hacky - you have to set cache to 0 in ionic.angular.js file:
