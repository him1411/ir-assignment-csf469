I have always found startup profile files of other people both useful and instructive about the language. Moreover, while I have some customization for Bash and Vim, I have nothing for R.For example, one thing I always wanted is different colors for input and output text in a window terminal, and maybe even syntax highlighting.Here is mine. It won\'t help you with the coloring but I get that from ESS and Emacs...I hate to type the full words \'head\', \'summary\', \'names\' every time, so I use aliases.You can put aliases into your .Rprofile file, but you have to use the full path to the function (e.g. utils::head) otherwise it won\'t work.EDIT: to answer your question, you can use the colorout package to have different colors in the terminal. Cool! :-)Although I don\'t actually have that in my .Rprofile, because it might breaks my coauthors\' code, I wish it was the default. Why?1) Character vectors use less memory (but only barely); 2) More importantly, we would avoid problems such as: and Factors are great when you need them (e.g. implementing ordering in graphs) but a nuisance most of the time.Here\'s mine.  I always use the main cran repository, and have code to make it easy to source in-development package code.I like saving my R command history and having it available each time I run R:In the shell or .bashrc:in .Rprofile:Here are two functions I find handy for working with windows.The first converts the \\s to /.The second opens the working directory in a new explorer window.I\'ve got this, more dynamic trick to use full terminal width, which tries to read from the COLUMNS environment variable (on Linux):This way R will use the full width even as you resize your terminal window.Most of my personal functions and loaded libraries are in the Rfunctions.r scriptHere\'s from my ~/.Rprofile, designed for Mac and Linux.These make errors easier to see.I hate the CRAN menu choice, so set to a good one.More history!The following is for running on Mac OSX from the terminal (which I greatly prefer to R.app because it\'s more stable, and you can organize your work by directory; also make sure to get a good ~/.inputrc).  By default, you get an X11 display, which doesn\'t look as nice; this instead gives a quartz display same as the GUI.  The if statement is supposed to catch the case when you\'re running R from the terminal on Mac.And preload a few libraries,where util.r is a random bag of stuff I use, under flux.Also, since other people were mentioning console width, here\'s how I do it.This actually isn\'t in .Rprofile because you have to re-run it every time you resize the terminal window.  I have it in util.r then I just source it as necessary.Here are mine:Make data.frames display somewhat like \'head\', only without having to type \'head\'(From How to make 'head' be applied automatically to output? )I often have a chain of debug calls I need to call and uncommenting them can be very tedious. With the help of the SO community, I went for the following solution and inserted this into my .Rprofile.site. # BROWSER is there for my Eclipse Tasks so that I have an overview of browser calls in the Task View window.Mine is not too fancy:I do a lot of work from mysql databases, so connecting right away is a godsend. I only wish there was a way of listing the avaialble databases so I wouldn\'t have to remember all the different names. Stephen Turner\'s post on .Rprofiles has several useful aliases and starter functions.I find myself using his ht and hh often.I use the following to get cacheSweave (or pgfSweave) to work with the "Compile PDF" button in RStudio:Mine includes options(menu.graphics=FALSE) because I like to Disable/suppress tcltk popup for CRAN mirror selection in R.Here\'s mine.  Nothing too innovative.  Thoughts on why particular choices:Without further ado:Here\'s a little snippet for use exporting tables to LaTeX. It changes all the column names to math mode for the many reports I write. The rest of my .Rprofile is pretty standard and mostly covered above.I set my lattice color theme in my profile.  Here are two other tweaks I use:I have an environment variable R_USER_WORKSPACE which points to the top directory of my packages. In .Rprofile I define a function devlib which sets the working directory (so that data() works) and sources all .R files in the R subdirectory. It is quite similar to Hadley\'s l() function above.Here\'s mine, including some of the mentioned ideas.Two things you might want to look at: .I found two functions really necessary: First when I have set debug() on several functions and I have resolved the bug, so I want to undebug() all functions - not one by one. The undebug_all() function added as the accepted answer here is the best.Second, when I have defined many functions and I am looking for a specific variable name, it\'s hard to find it within all results of the the ls(), including the function names. The lsnofun() function posted here is really good.
