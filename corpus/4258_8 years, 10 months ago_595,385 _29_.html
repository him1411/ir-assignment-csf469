Within an unordered list:Adding a class or style attribute is permitted but padding the text and adding or changing tags is not allowed.The page is rendering with Courier New.Goal is to have text after span lined up.Justification of the "OR" is unimportant.The lazy animal text may be wrapped in an additional element but I\'ll have to double check.Like Eoin said, you need to put a non-breaking space into your "empty" spans, but you can\'t assign a width to an inline element, only padding/margin so you\'ll need to make it float so that you can give it a width.For a jsfiddle example, see http://jsfiddle.net/laurensrietveld/JZ2Lg/In an ideal world you\'d achieve this simply using the following cssThis works on all browsers apart from FF2 and below.Firefox 2 and lower don\'t support this\n  value. You can use -moz-inline-box,\n  but be aware that it\'s not the same as\n  inline-block, and it may not work as\n  you expect in some situations.Quote taken from quirksmodeUnfortunately inline elements (or elements having display:inline) ignore the width property. You should use floating divs instead:Now I see you need to use spans and lists, so we need to rewrite this a little bit:The <span> tag will need to be set to display:block as it is an inline element and will ignore width.so:and then:You can do this method for assigning width for inline elementsPeople span in this case cant be a block element because rest of the text in between li elements will go down. Also using float is very bad idea because you will need to set width for whole li element and this width will need to be the same as width of whole ul element or other container.Try something like this in html:and in the cssso, when the li element is relative you format the span element to be as absolute and at the top:0;left:0; so it stays upper left and you set the padding-left (or: padding:0px 0px 0px 80px;) to set this free space for span element.It should work better for simple cases.You can do it using a table, but it is not pure CSS.Note that it doesn\'t display exactly like you want, because it switches line on each option. However, I hope that this helps you come closer to the answer.Well, there\'s always the brute force method:Or is that what you meant by "padding" the text? That\'s an ambiguous work in this context.This sounds kind of like a homework question. I hope you\'re not trying to get us to do your homework for you?
