I am getting a NoClassDefFoundError when I run my Java application.  What is typically the cause of this?This is caused when there is a class file that your code depends on and it is present at compile time but not found at runtime. Look for differences in your build time and runtime  classpaths. While it\'s possible that this is due to a classpath mismatch between compile-time and run-time, it\'s not necessarily true.It is important to keep two or three different exceptions straight in our head in this case:java.lang.ClassNotFoundException  This exception indicates that the class was not found on the classpath.  This indicates that we were trying to load the class definition, and the class did not exist on the classpath.java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError  This exception indicates that the JVM looked in its internal class definition data structure for the definition of a class and did not find it.  This is different than saying that it could not be loaded from the classpath.  Usually this indicates that we previously attempted to load a class from the classpath, but it failed for some reason - now we\'re trying to use the class again (and thus need to load it, since it failed last time), but we\'re not even going to try to load it, because we failed loading it earlier (and reasonably suspect that we would fail again).  The earlier failure could be a ClassNotFoundException or an ExceptionInInitializerError (indicating a failure in the static initialization block) or any number of other problems.  The point is, a NoClassDefFoundError is not necessarily a classpath problem.Here is the code to illustrate java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError.NoClassDefFoundErrorDemo.javaSimpleCalculator.javaI have found that sometimes I get a NoClassDefFound error when code is compiled with an incompatible version of the class found at runtime.  The specific instance I recall is with the apache axis library.  There were actually 2 versions on my runtime classpath and it was picking up the out of date and incompatible version and not the correct one, causing a NoClassDefFound error.  This was in a command line app where I was using a command similar to this.  I was able to get it to pick up the proper version by using:NoClassDefFoundError In JavaDefinition: Java Virtual Machine is not able to find a particular class at runtime which was available at compile time.If a class was present during compile time but not available in java classpath during runtime.Examples:A simple example of NoClassDefFoundError is class belongs to a missing JAR file or JAR was not added into classpath or sometimes jar\'s name has been changed by someone like in my case one of my colleagues has changed tibco.jar into tibco_v3.jar and the program is failing with java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError and I were wondering what\'s wrong.Just try to run with explicitly -classpath option with the classpath you think will work and if it\'s working then it\'s a sure short sign that someone is overriding java classpath.Possible Solutions:Resources:3 ways to solve NoClassDefFoundErrorjava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError Problem patternsI was using spring framework with maven and solved this error in my project.There was a runtime error in the class.\nI was reading a property as integer, but when it read the value from the property file, its value was double.\nSpring did not give me a full stack trace of on which line the runtime failed.\nIt simply said NoClassDefFoundError. But when I executed it as a native Java Application (taking it out of MVC), it gave ExceptionInInitializerError which was the true cause and which is how I traced the error.@xli\'s answer gave me insight into what may be wrong in my code.I get NoClassFoundError when classes loaded by the runtime class loader cannot access classes already loaded by the java rootloader. Because the different class loaders are in different security domains (according to java) the jvm won\'t allow classes already loaded by the rootloader to be resolved in the runtime loader address space.Run your program with \'java -javaagent:tracer.jar [YOUR java ARGS]\'It produces output showing the loaded class, and the loader env that loaded the class.  It\'s very helpful tracing why a class cannot be resolved.This is the best solution I found so far.Suppose we have a package called org.mypackage containing the classes:and the files defining this package are stored physically under the directory D:\\myprogram (on Windows) or /home/user/myprogram (on Linux).The file structure will look like this:\nWhen we invoke Java, we specify the name of the application to run: org.mypackage.HelloWorld. However we must also tell Java where to look for the files and directories defining our package. So to launch the program, we have to use the following command:\nIn case you have generated-code (EMF etc.) there can be too many static initialisers which consume all stack space. How to increase the Java stack size?.The technique below helped me many times:where the TheNoDefFoundClass is the class that might be "lost" due to a preference for an older version of the same library used by your program. This most frequently happens with the cases, when the client software is being deployed into a dominant container, armed with its own classloaders and tons of ancient versions of most popular libs.I have a same problem I was stock long hr. I found the solution, In my case, there is the static method defined due to that The JVM can not create the another object of that class.\nexample,\nprivate static HttpHost proxy = new HttpHost(proxyHost, Integer.valueOf(proxyPort), "http");If someone comes here because of java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/log4j/Logger error, in my case it was produced because I used log4j 2 (but I didn\'t add all the files that come with it), and some dependency library used log4j 1. The solution was to add the Log4j 1.x bridge: the jar log4j-1.2-api-<version>.jar which comes with log4j 2. More info in the log4j 2 migration.make sure this matches in the module:app and module:lib I got this message after removing 2 files from the SRC library, and when I brought them back I kept seeing this Error message. \nMy solution was:restart Eclipse. Since then I havn\'t seen this message again :-)
