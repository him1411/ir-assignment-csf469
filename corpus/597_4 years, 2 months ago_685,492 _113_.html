I am running into this error of: I tried to add the keys and I get this error below:You might need to start ssh-agent before you run the ssh-add command:Note that this will start the agent for msysgit Bash on Windows. If you\'re using a different shell or operating system, you might need to use a variant of the command, such as those listed in the other answers.See the following answers:To automatically start ssh-agent and allow a single instance to work in multiple console windows, see Start ssh-agent on login.To find out why, see Robin Green\'s answer.Also, whenever I use ssh-add, I always add private keys to it. The file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub looks like a public key, I\'m not sure if that will work.  Do you have a ~/.ssh/id_rsa file? If you open it in a text editor, does it say it\'s a private key?I tried the other solutions to no avail. I made more research and found that the following command worked. I am using WindowsÂ 7 and Git Bash.More information in: https://coderwall.com/p/rdi_wqThe following command worked for me. I am using CentOS.If you\'re using Msysgit or Cygwin you can find a good tutorial at SSH-Agent in msysgit and cygwin and bash:Add a file called .bashrc to your home folder.Open the file and paste in:This assumes that your key is in the conventional ~/.ssh/id_rsa location. If it isn\'t, include a full path after the ssh-add command.Add to or create file ~/.ssh/config with the contentsIn the original tutorial the ForwardAgent param is Yes, but it\'s a typo. Use all lowercase or you\'ll get errors.Restart Msysgit. It will ask you to enter your passphrase once, and that\'s it (until you end the session, or your ssh-agent is killed.)If you don\'t want to start a new ssh-agent every time you open a terminal, check out Keychain. I\'m on a Mac now, so I used the tutorial ssh-agent with zsh & keychain on Mac OS X to set it up, but I\'m sure a Google search will have plenty of info for Windows.Update: A better solution on Mac is to add your key to the Mac OS Keychain:Simple as that.To resolve this error:bash:tcsh:Then use ssh-add as you normally would.Hot Tip:I was always forgetting what to type for the above ssh-agent commands, so I created an alias in my .bashrc file like this:Now instead of using ssh-agent, I can use ssh-agent-cygE.g.Original Source of fix:http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2011-10/msg00313.htmlI faced the same problem for Linux, and here is what I did:Basically, the command ssh-agent starts the agent, but it doesn\'t really set the environment variables for it to run. It just outputs those variables to the shell.You need to:and then do ssh-add. See Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.ssh-add and ssh (assuming you are using the openssh implementations) require an environment variable to know how to talk to the ssh agent. If you started the agent in a different command prompt window to the one you\'re using now, or if you started it incorrectly, neither ssh-add nor ssh will see that environment variable set (because the environment variable is set locally to the command prompt it\'s set in).You don\'t say which version of ssh you\'re using, but if you\'re using cygwin\'s, you can use this recipe from SSH Agent on Cygwin: This will start an agent automatically for each new command prompt window that you open (which is suboptimal if you open multiple command prompts in one session, but at least it should work).Try to the following steps: 1) Open Git Bash and run: cd ~/.ssh 2) Try to run agent :  eval $(ssh-agent)3) Right now, you can run the following command : ssh-add -l In Windows 10 I tried all answers listed here but none of them seemed to work. In fact they give a clue. To solve a problem simply you need 3 commands. The idea of this problem is that ssh-add needs SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID environment variables to be set with current ssh-agent sock file path and pid number.This will save output of ssh-agent in file. Text file content will be something like this:Copy something like "/tmp/ssh-kjmxRb2764/agent.2764" from text file and run following command directly in console:Copy something like "3044" from text file and run following command directly in console: Now when environment variables (SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID) are set for current console session run your ssh-add command and it will not fail again to connect ssh agent.Instead of using $ ssh-agent -s   I used $ eval ssh-agent -s to solve >this issue.Here is what I performed step by step (step 2 onwards on GitBash):Cleaned up my .ssh folder at C:\\user\\.ssh\\  Generated a new SSH key\n   $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "xyz@abc.com"  Check if any process id(ssh agent) is already running.\n   $ ps aux | grep ssh  (Optional) If found any in step 3, kill those\n   $ kill <pids>  Started the ssh agent\n   $ eval `ssh-agent -s`  Added ssh key generated in step 2 to ssh agent\n   $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  To amplify on n3o\'s answer for Windows 7...My problem was indeed that some required environment variables weren\'t set, and n3o is correct that ssh-agent tells you how to set those environment variables, but doesn\'t actually set them.Since Windows doesn\'t let you do "eval," here\'s what to do instead:Redirect the output of ssh-agent to a batch file withNow use a text editor such as Notepad to edit temp.bat. For each of the first two lines:\n- Insert the word "set" and a space at the beginning of the line.\n- Delete the first semicolon and everything that follows.Now delete the third line. Your temp.bat should look something like this:Run temp.bat. This will set the environment variables that are needed for ssh-add to work.One thing I came across was that eval did not work for me using Cygwin, what worked for me was ssh-agent ssh-add id_rsa.After that I came across an issue that my private key was too open, the solution I managed to find for that (from here):as well asfinally I was able to use:If you follow these instructions, your problem would be solved.If you\xe2\x80\x99re on a Mac or Linux machine, type:If you\xe2\x80\x99re on a Windows machine, type:I just got this working.  Open your ~/.ssh/config file.Append the following-The page that gave me the hint Set up SSH for Git\nsaid that the single space indentation is important... though I had a configuration in here from Heroku that did not have that space and works properly.Let me offer another solution.  If you have just installed Git 1.8.2.2 or thereabouts, and you want to enable SSH, follow the well-writen directions.Everything through to Step 5.6 where you might encounter a slight snag.  If an SSH agent is already be running you could get the following error message when you restart bashIf you do, use the following command to see if more than one ssh-agent process is runningIf you see more than one ssh-agent service, you will need to kill all of these processes.  Use the kill command as follows (the PID will be unique on your computer)Example:After you have removed all of the ssh-agent processes, run the px aux | grep ssh command again to be sure they are gone, then restart Bash.Voila, you should now get something like this:Now you can continue on Step 5.7 and beyond.Note: this is an answer to this question, which has been merged with this one.\n  That question was for Windows 7, meaning my answer was for Cygwin/MSYS/MSYS2. This one seems for some unix, where I wouldn\'t expect the SSH agent needing to be managed like this.This will run the SSH agent and authenticate only the first time you need it, not every time you open your Bash terminal. It can be used for any program using SSH in general, including ssh itself and scp. Just add this to /etc/profile.d/ssh-helper.sh:Try the following:Use parameter -A when you connect to server, example:from man page : I had this problem, when I started ssh-agent, when it was already running.  Gets confused.  To see if this is the case, useto see if this is the same as what you thought it should be. In my case, it was different than the one I just started.To further verify if you have more than one ssh-agent running, you can review:I had a similar problem when I was trying to get this to work on Windows to connect to stash via sshHere is the solution that worked for me.Turns out I was running Pageant ssh agent on my Windows box - I would check what you are running. I suspect it is Pageant as it comes as default with Putty and winScpThe ssh-add does not work from command line with this type of agentYou need to add the private key via pageant UI window which you can get by doublicking the Pageant icon in the taskbar (once it is started).Before you add the key to Pageant you need to convert it to PPK format. Full instructions are available here How to convert SSH key to ppk formatThat is it. Once I uploaded my key to stash I was able to use SourceTree to create a local repo and clone the remote.Hope this helps...Read @cupcake\'s answer for explanations. Here I only try to automate the fix.If you using Cygwin terminal with BASH, add the following to $HOME/.bashrc file. This only starts ssh-agent once in the first Bash terminal and adds the keys to ssh-agent. (Not sure if this is required on Linux)DONT FORGET to add your correct keys in "ssh-add" command.For bash built into Windows 10, I added this to .bash_profile:I resolved the error by force stopping (killed) git processes (ssh agent), then uninstalling Git, and then installing Git again.Using Git Bash on Win8.1E, my resolution was as follows:If you are using Putty, perhaps you need to set the "Connection/SSH/Auth/Allow agent forwarding" option to "true".This worked for me.In the CMD window, type the following command:In my case, my Comodo firewall had sandboxed the ssh agent. Once I disabled sandboxing I was able to clone the repository.FYI, I am using Comodo firewall on Windows 7.Even I was getting "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent." on running the command while generating and adding SSH key: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa. I resolved it by stopping the multiple ssh-agent instances running on my machine and then uninstalled the Git from control panel on my windows machine and then again installed Git and things were working now.Also check you remote url. use git@github... instead of https:// proptocolsee https://stackoverflow.com/a/33928364/551811I was having trouble with PoSH and the Start-SshAgent / Add-SshKey commands, so I whipped up a quick script that might help some folks out. This is intended to be added to your PowerShell profile which you can edit by executing notepad $PROFILEIt will detect if the ssh-agent is running or not and only execute if there is no agent running already. Please note that $ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.ExpandString is a pretty dangerous command so you may not want to use this solution if you are using an untrusted copy of ssh-agent.
