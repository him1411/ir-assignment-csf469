I am quite confused. I should be able to set and IE8 and IE9 should render the page using the latest rendering engine. However, I just tested it, and if Compatibility Mode is turned on elsewhere on our site, it will stay on for our page, even though we should be forcing it not to. How are you supposed to make sure IE does not use Compatibility Mode (even in an intranet)?FWIW, I am using the HTML5 DocType declaration (<!doctype html>).Here are the first few lines of the page:EDIT: I just learned that the default setting on IE8 is to use IE7 compatibility mode for intranet sites. Would this override the X-UA-Compatible meta tag?If you need to override IE\'s Compatibility View Settings for intranet sites you can do so in the web.config (IIS7) or through the custom HTTP headers in the web site\'s properties (IIS6) and set X-UA-Compatible there.  The meta tag doesn\'t override IE\'s intranet setting in Compatibility View Settings, but if you set it at the hosting server it will override the compatibility.Example for web.config in IIS7:Edit: I removed the clear code from just before the add; it was an unnecessary oversight from copying and pasting.  Good catch, commenters!Server Side solution is the recommended one, as @TimmyFranks proposed in his answer, but if one needs to implement the X-UA-Compatible rule on the page level, please read the following tips, to benefit from the experience of the one who already got burned :-)The X-UA-Compatible meta tag must appear straight after the title in the <head> element. No other meta tags, css links and js scripts calls can be placed before it.If there are any conditional comments  in the page (lets say located in the <html>), they must be placed under, after the <head>.EDIT: Html5BoilerPlate\'s team wrote about this bug - http://h5bp.com/i/378\nThey have several solutions.Regarding Intranet & Compatibility view, there\'re settings when you go to tools > Compatibility view settings.Note that if you are serving it from PHP, you can use the following code to fix it as well.As it turns out, this has to do with Microsoft\'s "intelligent" choice to make all intranet sites force to compatibility mode, even if X-UA-Compatible is set to IE=edge.I also got the same issue of IE9 rendering in IE7 Document standards for local host.\nI tried many conditional comments tags but unsuccesful.\nIn the end I just removed all conditional tags and just added meta tag immediatly after head like below and it worked like charm.Hope it helpsEven if you have unchecked the "Display intranet sites in Compatibility View" option, and have the X-UA-Compatible in your response headers, there is another reason why your browser might default to "Compatibility View" anyways - your Group Policy. Look at your console for the following message:HTML1203: xxx.xxx has been configured to run in Compatibility View through Group Policy. Where xxx.xxx is the domain for your site (i.e. test.com). If you see this then the group policy for your domain is set so that any site ending in test.com will automatically render in Compatibility mode regardless of doctype, headers, etc.For more information, please see the following link (explains the html codes): http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh180764(v=vs.85).aspxAs NEOSWF points out above, the Paul Irish conditional comments stops the meta tag having any affect.There are several fixes all here (http://nicolasgallagher.com/better-conditional-classnames-for-hack-free-css/)These include:Adding two HTML classes, using server headers and adding a conditional comment above the doctype.On my latest project I decided to remove the Paul Irish conditional comments. I didn\'t like the idea of adding anything before the html without doing LOTS of testing first and it\'s nice to see what has been set just by looking at the HTML.In the end I surrounded a div straight after the body and used conditional comments egI could have done this around the body but its more difficult with CMSs like Wordpress. Obviously its another DIV inside the markup, but its only for older browsers.I think it could be a per project based decision though.I\'ve also read something about the charset meta tag needing to come in the first 1024 bytes so this ensures that.Sometimes the simplest, easiest to read ideas are the best and its definitely worth thinking about! Thanks to the 6th comment on the link above for pointing this out.X-UA-Compatible will only override the Document Mode, not the Browser Mode, and will not work for all intranet sites; if this is your case, the best solution is to disable "Display intranet sites in Compatibility View" and set a group policy setting to specify which intranet sites need compatibility mode.I added the following to my htaccess file, which did the trick:Additionally, X-UA-Compatible must be the first meta tag in the head sectionBy the way, the correct order or the main head tags are:This way For Nginx,ref : https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs/commit/a5b0a8f736d68f7de27cdcb202e32975a74bd2c5Timmy Franks had it right for me. We just had the issue today where the client had IE8 company-wide, and it was forcing the site we wrote for their intranet into compatibility mode. Setting "IE-Edge" seemed to fix it.I was able to get around this loading the headers before the HTML with php, and it worked very well.ix.html is the content I wanted to load after sending the headers.I had the same issue after trying many combination I had this working \nnote I have compatibility checked for intranet If you are using LAMP stack, then add this into your .htaccess file in your web root folder.  No need to add it to every PHP file.IE 11 doesn\'t allow you to override the browser compatibility view setting anymore by sending the header...It appears the only way to force the browser to not use compatibility view is to have the user disable it in their browser.  Ours is an Intranet site, and the default IE option is to use compatibility view for Intranet sites.  What a pain!We were able to prevent the need for the user to change their browser settings for users of IE 9 and 10, but it no longer works in IE 11.  Our IE users are switching to Chrome, where this is not a problem, and never has been.I was experiencing the same issue in IE11. None of these answers solved my issue. After digging a bit, I noticed that the browser was running in Enterprise mode. (verify by hitting F12 and click the emulation tab, look for browser profile dropdown) The setting was locked, not allowing me to change the setting.I was able to change the profile to Desktop after deleting CurrentVersion from the following registry key:After changing the mode to Desktop the answers on this post will work.
