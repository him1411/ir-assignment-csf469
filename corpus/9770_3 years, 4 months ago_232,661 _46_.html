I am trying to mount a host directory into the docker container so that any updates done on the host is reflected into the docker containers. I couldn\'t succeed after googling and reading the docker volume links.Can somebody point me where I am doing wrong. Here is what I did1 directory, 5 files\nkishore$ pwd\n/Users/kishore/tdock\nkishore$ docker run -d -v /Users/kishore/main_folder:/test_container k3_s3:latest\nc9f9a7e09c54ee1c2cc966f15c963b4af320b5203b8c46689033c1ab8872a0earoot@0f17e2313a46:/test_container# exit\nexitQuestions, issues facing:There are a couple ways you can do this. The simplest way to do so is to use the dockerfile ADD command like so:However, any changes made to this directory on the host after building the dockerfile will not show up in the container. This is because when building a container, docker compresses the directory into a .tar and uploads that context into the container permanently.The second way to do this is the way you attempted, which is to mount a volume. Due to trying to be as portable as possible you cannot map a host directory to a docker container directory within a dockerfile, because the host directory can change depending on which machine you are running on. To map a host directory to a docker container directory you need to use the -v flag when using docker run like so:2 successive mounts :\nI guess many posts here might be using two boot2docker , the reason you don\'t see anything is because you are mounting a directory from boot2docker not from your host. \nYou basically need 2 successive mounts : the first one to mount a directory from your host to your system and the second to mount the new directory from boot2docker to your container like this:then when you ls inside containerfolder you will see the content of your hostfolderIs it possible that you use docker on OS X via boot2docker or something similar. I\'ve made the same experience - the command is correct but nothing (sensible) is mounted in the container, anyway.As it turns out - it\'s already explained in the docker documentation. When you type docker run -v /var/logs/on/host:/var/logs/in/container ... then /var/logs/on/host is actually mapped from the boot2docker VM-image, not your Mac. You\'ll have to pipe the shared folder through your VM to your actual host (the Mac in my case).[UPDATE] As of ~June 2017, Docker for Mac takes care of all the annoying parts of this where you have to mess with VirtualBox. It lets you map basically everything on your local host using the /private prefix. More info here. [/UPDATE]All the current answers talk about Boot2docker. Since that\'s now deprecated in favor of docker-machine, this works for docker-machine:First, ssh into the docker-machine vm and create the folder we\'ll be mapping to:Now share the folder to VirtualBox:Finally, ssh into the docker-machine again and mount the folder we just shared:Note: for UID and GID you can basically use whatever integers as long as they\'re not already taken.This is tested as of docker-machine 0.4.1 and docker 1.8.3 on OS X El Capitan.you can use -v option from cli, this facility is not available via Dockerfiledocker run -t -i -v <host_dir>:<container_dir>  ubuntu /bin/bashwhere host_dir is the directory from host which you want to mount.\nyou don\'t need to worry about directory of container if it doesn\'t exist docker will create it.If you do any changes in host_dir from host machine (under root privilege) it will be visible to container and vice versa. I\'m just experimenting with getting my SailsJS app running inside a Docker container to keep my physical machine clean.I\'m using the following command to mount my SailsJS/NodeJS application under /app:In my system I\'ve corrected the answer from nhjk, it works flawless when you add the -t flag.Jul 2015 update - boot2docker now supports direct mounting. You can use -v /var/logs/on/host:/var/logs/in/container directly from your Mac prompt, without double mountingboot2docker together with VirtualBox Guest Additions\nHow to mount /Users into boot2dockerhttps://medium.com/boot2docker-lightweight-linux-for-docker/boot2docker-together-with-virtualbox-guest-additions-da1e3ab2465ctl;dr Build your own custom boot2docker.iso with VirtualBox Guest\n  Additions (see link) or download\n  http://static.dockerfiles.io/boot2docker-v1.0.1-virtualbox-guest-additions-v4.3.12.iso\n  and save it to ~/.boot2docker/boot2docker.iso.How do I link the main_folder to the test_container folder present inside the docker container?Your command below is correct, unless your on a mac using boot2docker(depending on future updates) in which case you may find the folder empty. See mattes answer for a tutorial on correcting this.I need to make this run automatically, how to do that without really\nusing the run -d -v command.You can\'t really get away from using these commands, they are intrinsic to the way docker works. You would be best off putting them into a shell script to save you writing them out repeatedly. What happens if boot2docker crashes? Where are the docker files stored?If you manage to use the -v arg and reference your host machine then the files will be safe on your host.If you\'ve used \'docker build -t myimage .\' with a Dockerfile then your files will be baked into the image.Your docker images, i believe, are stored in the boot2docker-vm. I found this out when my images disappeared when i delete the vm from VirtualBox. (Note, i don\'t know how Virtualbox works, so the images might be still hidden somewhere else, just not visible to docker).Had the same problem. Found this in the docker documentation: Note: The host directory is, by its nature, host-dependent. For this reason, you can\xe2\x80\x99t mount a host directory from Dockerfile, the VOLUME instruction does not support passing a host-dir, because built images should be portable. A host directory wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be available on all potential hosts.So, mounting a read/write host directory is only possible with the -v parameter in the docker run command, as the other answers point out correctly.
