My problem is related to Fatal Git error when switching branch.I try to fetch a remote branch with the commandbut I get this error message:fatal: git checkout: updating paths is incompatible with switching branches.\n  Did you intend to checkout \'origin/remote-name\' which can not be resolved as commit?If I manually create a branch and then pull the remote branch, it works, just as making a new clone and checking the branch out.Why does it not work on the repository I work with?I believe this occurs when you are trying to checkout a remote branch that your local git repo is not aware of yet.  Try:If the remote branch you want to checkout is under "New remote branches" and not "Tracked remote branches" then you need to fetch them first:Now it should work:Alternate syntax,After having tried most of what I could read in this thread without success, I stumbled across this one:\nRemote branch not showing up in "git branch -r"It turned out that my .git/config file was incorrect. After doing a simple fix all branches showed up.Going fromtoDid the trickNot sure if this is helpful or exactly relevant to your question, but if you are trying to fetch and checkout only a single branch from the remote repository, then the following git commands will do the trick:none of the above worked for me. My situation is slightly different, my remote branch is not at origin. but in a different repository.tip: if you don\'t see the remote branch in the following output git branch -v -a there is no  way to check it out.Confirmed working on 1.7.5.4For me what worked was:Which pulls all the refs down to your machine for all the branches on remote. Then I could do and that worked perfectly. Similar to the top voted answer, but a little more simple. I suspect there is no remote branch named remote-name, but that you\'ve inadvertently created a local branch named origin/remote-name.Is it possible you at some point typed:Thus creating a local branch named origin/remote-name?  Type this command:You\'ll either see:which means it\'s really a mis-named local branch, orwhich means it really is a remote branch.It\'s not very intuitive but this works well for me ... THEN run the git branch --track command ...Could your issue be linked to this other SO question "checkout problem"?i.e.: a problem related to:Note: what the checkout.sh script says is:It is like the syntax  git checkout -b [] [remote_branch_name] was both renaming the branch and resetting the new starting point of the new branch, which is deemed incompatible.After fetching a zillion times still added remotes didn\'t show up, although the blobs were in the pool. Turns out the --tags option shouldn\'t be given to git remote add for whatever reason. You can manually remove it from the .git/config to make git fetch create the refs.
