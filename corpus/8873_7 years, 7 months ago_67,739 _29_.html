Why does the following work?Whereas this doesn\'t work:To make it even clearer: At the moment I\'m not able to pass a CSS property to the animate function as a variable.{ thetop : 10 } is a valid object literal.  The code will create an object with a property named thetop that has a value of 10.  Both the following are the same:In ES5 and earlier, you cannot use a variable as a property name inside an object literal.  Your only option is to do the following:ES6 defines ComputedPropertyName as part of the grammar for object literals, which allows you to write the code like this:You can test drive this new syntax in recent versions of Firefox, Chrome and Microsoft Edge.With ECMAScript 2015 you are now able to do it directly in object declaration with the brackets notation:Â Where key can be any sort of expression (e.g. a variable) returning a value.So here your code would look like:Where thetop will be replaced by the variable value.ES5 quote that says it should not workSpec: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.1.5PropertyName :[...]The production PropertyName : IdentifierName is evaluated as follows:The production PropertyName : StringLiteral is evaluated as follows:The production PropertyName : NumericLiteral is evaluated as follows:This means that:{ theTop : 10 } is the exact same as { \'theTop\' : 10 }The PropertyName theTop is an IdentifierName, so it gets converted to the \'theTop\' string value, which is the string value of \'theTop\'.It is not possible to write object initializers (literals) with variable keys.The only three options are IdentifierName (expands to string literal), StringLiteral, and NumericLiteral (also expands to a string).Rules have changed for ES6: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2274327/895245 I have used the following to add a property with a "dynamic" name to an object:key is the name of the new property. The object of properties passed to animate will be {left: 20, width: 100, top: 10}This is just using the required [] notation as recommended by the other answers, but with fewer lines of code!Adding square bracket around the variable works good for me.
