In Prototype I can show a "loading..." image with this code:In jQuery, I can load a server page into an element with this:but how do I attach a loading spinner to this command as I did in Prototype?There are a couple of ways. My preferred way is to attach a function to the ajaxStart/Stop events on the element itself.The ajaxStart/Stop functions will fire whenever you do any Ajax calls.Update: As of jQuery 1.8, the documentation states that .ajaxStart/Stop should only be attached to document. This would transform the above snippet to:For jQuery I useYou can just use the Jquery Ajax function and use its option beforeSend and define some function in which you can show something like loader div and on success option you can hide that loader div here some code to make you understand:Hope that helps in that loader div you can have any Spinning Gif image here is a website that is a great Ajax Loader Generator according to your Color Scheme : http://ajaxload.info/You can insert the animated image into the DOM right before the AJAX call, and do an inline function to remove it...This will make sure your animation starts at the same frame on subsequent requests (if that matters). Note that old versions of IE might have difficulties with the animation.Good luck!http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/load#urldatacallbackIf you are using $.ajax() you can use somthing like this:Use the loading plugin:  http://plugins.jquery.com/project/loadingVariant: I have an icon with id="logo" at the top left of the main page; a spinner gif is then overlaid on top (with transparency) when ajax is working.I ended up with two changes to the original reply. This is the code after these changes:You can simply assign a loader image to the same tag on which you later will load content using an Ajax call:You can also replace the span tag with an image tag.As well as setting global defaults for ajax events, you can set behaviour for specific elements. Perhaps just changing their class would be enough?Example CSS, to hide #myForm with a spinner:I also want to contribute to this answer. I was looking for something similar in jQuery and this what I eventually ended up using.I got my loading spinner from http://ajaxload.info/. My solution is based on this simple answer at http://christierney.com/2011/03/23/global-ajax-loading-spinners/.Basically your HTML markup and CSS would look like this:And then you code for jQuery would look something like this:It is as simple as that :)I\'ve used the following with jQuery UI Dialog. (Maybe it works with other ajax callbacks?)The  contains an animated loading gif until its content is replaced when the ajax call completes.Note that you must use asynchronous calls for spinners to work (at least that is what caused mine to not show until after the ajax call and then swiftly went away as the call had finished and removed the spinner).I do this:I think you are right. \nThis method is too global... However - it is a good default for when your AJAX call has no effect on the page itself. (background save for example). ( you can always switch it off for a certain ajax call by passing "global":false - see documentation at jquery When the AJAX call is meant to refresh part of the page,  I like my "loading" images to be specific to the refreshed section. I would like to see which part is refreshed. Imagine how cool it would be if you could simply write something like : And this would show a "loading" on this section. \nBelow is a function I wrote that handles "loading" display as well but it is specific to the area you are refreshing in ajax. First, let me show you how to use it And this is the function - a basic start that you can enhance as you wish. it is very flexible. This is the best way for me:jQuery:Coffee:Docs: ajaxStart, ajaxStopIf you don\'t want to write your own code, there are also a lot of plugins that do just that:If you plan to use a loader everytime you make a server request, you can use the following pattern.This code in particular uses the jajaxloader plugin (which I just created)https://github.com/lingtalfi/JAjaxLoader/This is a very simple and smart plugin for that specific purpose:\nhttps://github.com/hekigan/is-loadingYou can always use Block UI jQuery plugin which does everything for you, and it even blocks the page of any input while the ajax is loading. In case that the plugin seems to not been working, you can read about the right way to use it in this answer. Check it out.
