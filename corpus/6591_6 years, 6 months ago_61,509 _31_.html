I forked a project on github and am successfully making changes to my local master and pushing to origin on github. I want to send a pull request, but only want to include the last commit.  The pull request UI on github.com shows the last 9 commits and I don\'t know how to filter that down.I was trying to understand if I should create a new local branch, check that out and somehow reset or rebase to upstream?  Then apply my last commit from my master by id to the new local branch and use that for the pull request?I\'m trying to get the concepts right and figure out the right command lines to do what I need.You need to basically create a new branch & cherry-pick the commits you want to add to it.Note: you might need these before the checkout/cherry-pick commandsgit remote add upstream <git repository>git remote updateAfterwards, you will see upstream branch on github, switch to it and can submit the pull request with the changes you want.Create a new branch starting from the latest commit, which is also in the origin repository:Then use git cherry-pick to get the single commit you want the pull request for. If the branch with this commit is called feature and the commit you want is the latest commit in this branch, this will beAssuming this patch applies without conflict, you got now a branch for which you can do your pull request.In a second step, you now need to decide what to do with your feature branch. If you haven\'t published your changes on this branch yet, the best procedure is probably rebasing this branch upon new-branch (and removing the last commit, if this is not done automatically by git rebase).I ended up in a situation where I had forked a fork and wanted to submit a pull request back to the original project. I had:To do this, I:The git commands were something like:Then I picked my-feature-request as the branch for my pull request to the original project.This almost worked for me:The only difference was this:I needed to change that last line so that git push would make the upstream branch in my GitHub repo so that I could make PR from it.I had already made the commit which I wanted to be able to isolate as a pull request back onto the current branch. So I checked out a new branchAnd here\'s where my solution differs from @Kevin Hakanson\'s, as I need to reset this branch to the place in the history I want to diff from And cherry-pick the commit from which I want to create an isolated pull request Finally push it up to the remoteAnd pull request dat shi. The solution to create a new (temporary) branch, cherry-pick and creating the pull request for that branch did not satisfy me. I did not want to change my repository to make a set of commits available, so I came up with the following alternative:First create patch files for all commits of interest:If the commit of interest happens to be the last one you can use HEAD instead <sha>.Now, you can send the patches to the maintainer of the source repository, who can apply them:Finally this should look the same as if a temporary branch was merged by a pull request, but without having that additional branch in the fork-repository.
