For <input type="number"> element, maxlength is not working. How can I restrict the maxlength for that number element?And you can add a max attribute that will specify the highest possible number that you may insertif you add both a max and a min value you can specify the range of allowed values:The above will still not stop a user from manually entering a value outside of the specified range. Instead he will be displayed a popup telling him to enter a value within this range upon submitting the form as shown in this screenshot:You can specify the min and max attributes, which will allow input only within a specific range.This only works for the spinner control buttons, however.  Although the user may be able to type a number greater than the allowed max, the form will not submit.  \nScreenshot taken from Chrome 15You can use the HTML5 oninput event in JavaScript to limit the number of characters:If you are looking for a Mobile Web solution in which you wish your user to see a number pad rather than a full text keyboard. Use type="tel".  It will work with maxlength which saves you from creating extra javascript.Max and Min will still allow the user to Type in numbers in excess of max and min, which is not optimal.You can combine all of these like this:\nUpdate:\nYou might also want to prevent any non-numeric characters to be entered, because object.length would be an empty string for the number inputs, and therefore its length would be 0. Thus the maxLengthCheck function won\'t work.Solution:\nSee this or this for examples.Demo - See the full version of the code here:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/DRSDavidSoft/zb4ft1qq/1/Update 2: Here\'s the update code:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/DRSDavidSoft/zb4ft1qq/2/Update 3:\nPlease note that allowing more than a decimal point to be entered can mess up with the numeral value.it\'s very simple, with some javascript you can simulate a maxlength, check it out:Or if your max value is for example 99 and minimum 0, you can add this to input element (your value will be rewrited by your max value etc.)Then (if you want), you could check if is input really numberIf you use "onkeypress" event then you will not get any user limitations as such while developing ( unit test it). And if you have requirement that do not allow user to enter after particular limit, take a look of this code and try once.You can specify it as text, but add pettern, that match numbers only:It works perfect and also on mobile ( tested on iOS 8 and Android ) pops out the number keyboard.Max length will not work with <input type="number" the best way i know is to use oninput event to limit the maxlength. Please see the below code for simple implementation.Maycow Moura\'s answer was a good start.\nHowever, his solution means that when you enter the second digit all editing of the field stops. So you cannot change values or delete any characters.The following code stops at 2, but allows editing to continue;I had this problem before and I solved it using a combination of html5 number type and jQuery.script:I don\'t know if the events are a bit overkill but it solved my problem.\nJSfiddleAs with type="number", you specify a max instead of maxlength property, which is the maximum possible number possible. So with 4 digits, max should be 9999, 5 digits 99999 and so on.Also if you want to make sure it is a positive number, you could set min="0", ensuring positive numbers.You can try this as well for numeric input with length restrictionAs stated by others, min/max is not the same as maxlength because people could still enter a float that would be larger than the maximum string length that you intended. To truly emulate the maxlength attribute, you can do something like this in a pinch (this is equivalent to maxlength="16"):Another option is to just add a listener for anything with the maxlength attribute and add the slice value to that.  Assuming the user doesn\'t want to use a function inside every event related to the input.  Here\'s a code snippet. Ignore the CSS and HTML code, the JavaScript is what matters.More relevant attributes to use would be min and max.I know there\'s an answer already, but if you want your input to behave exactly like the maxlength attribute or as close as you can, use the following code:As I found out you cannot use any of onkeydown, onkeypress or onkeyup events for a complete solution including mobile browsers. By the way onkeypress is deprecated and not present anymore in chrome/opera for android (see: UI Events\nW3C Working Draft, 04 August 2016).I figured out a solution using the oninput event only.\nYou may have to do additional number checking as required such as negative/positive sign or decimal and thousand separators and the like but as a start the following should suffice:I would also recommend to combine maxlength with min and max to prevent wrong submits as stated above several times.
