When encoding a query string to be sent to a web server - when do you use escape() and when do you use encodeURI() or encodeURIComponent():Use escape:ORuse encodeURI() / encodeURIComponent()Don\'t use it, as it has been deprecated since ECMAScript v3.Use encodeURI when you want a working URL. Make this call:to get:Don\'t call encodeURIComponent since it would destroy the URL and returnUse encodeURIComponent when you want to encode the value of a URL parameter.Then you may create the URL you need:And you will get this complete URL:http://example.net/?param1=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2F%Ffa%3D12%26b%3D55&param2=99Note that encodeURIComponent does not escape the \' character. A common bug is to use it to create html attributes such as href=\'MyUrl\', which could suffer an injection bug. If you are constructing html from strings, either use " instead of \' for attribute quotes, or add an extra layer of encoding (\' can be encoded as %27).For more information on this type of encoding you can check: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encodingThe difference between encodeURI() and encodeURIComponent() are exactly 11 characters encoded by encodeURIComponent but not by encodeURI:I generated this table easily with console.table in Google Chrome with this code:I found this article enlightening :\nJavascript Madness: Query String ParsingI found it when I was trying to undersand why decodeURIComponent was not decoding \'+\' correctly. Here is an extract:encodeURI() - the escape() function is for javascript escaping, not HTTP.encodeURIComponent doesn\'t encode -_.!~*\'(), causing problem in posting data to php in xml string.For example:\n<xml><text x="100" y="150" value="It\'s a value with single quote" />\n</xml>General escape with encodeURI\n%3Cxml%3E%3Ctext%20x=%22100%22%20y=%22150%22%20value=%22It\'s%20a%20value%20with%20single%20quote%22%20/%3E%20%3C/xml%3EYou can see, single quote is not encoded.\nTo resolve issue I created two functions to solve issue in my project, for Encoding URL:For Decoding URL:Small comparison table Java vs. JavaScript vs. PHP.Also remember that they all encode different sets of characters, and select the one you need appropriately.  encodeURI() encodes fewer characters than encodeURIComponent(), which encodes fewer (and also different, to dannyp\'s point) characters than escape().I recommend not to use one of those methods as is. Write your own function which does the right thing.MDN has given a good example on url encoding shown below.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponentFor the purpose of encoding javascript has given three inbuilt functions -escape() - does not encode @*/+\nThis method is deprecated after the ECMA 3 so it should be avoided.encodeURI() - does not encode ~!@#$&*()=:/,;?+\'\nIt assumes that the URI is a complete URI, so does not encode reserved characters that have special meaning in the URI.\nThis method is used when the intent is to convert the complete URL instead of some special segment of URL.\nExample - encodeURI(\'http://stackoverflow.com\');\nwill give - http://stackoverflow.comencodeURIComponent() -does not encode  - _ . ! ~ * \' ( )\nThis function encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character. This method should be used to convert a component of URL. For instance some user input needs to be appended\nExample - encodeURI(\'http://stackoverflow.com\');\nwill give - http%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.comAll this encoding is performed in UTF 8 i.e the characters will be converted in UTF-8 format. encodeURIComponent differ from encodeURI in that it encode reserved characters and Number sign # of encodeURII\'ve found that experimenting with the various methods is a good sanity check even after having a good handle of what their various uses and capabilities are.Towards that end I have found this website extremely useful to confirm my suspicions that I am doing something appropriately. It has also proven useful for decoding an encodeURIComponent\'ed string which can be rather challenging to interpret.
