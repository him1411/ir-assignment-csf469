One can request only the headers using HTTP HEAD, as option -I in curl(1).Lengthy HTML response bodies are a pain to get in command-line, so I\'d like to get only the header as feedback for my POST requests. However, HEAD and POST are two different methods.How do I get curl to display only response headers to a POST request?from the man page.  so dumps the headers to stdout and sends the data to /dev/null (that\'s a GET, not a POST, but you can do the same thing with a POST - just add whatever option you\'re already using for POSTing data)note the - after the -D which indicates that the output "file" is stdout.The other answers require the response body to be downloaded. But there\'s a way to make a POST request that will only fetch the header:An -I by itself performs a HEAD request which can be overridden by -X POST to perform a POST (or any other) request and still only get the header data.For long response bodies (and various other similar situations), the solution I use is always to pipe to less, soor will do the job.A Much simpler and easier approach is to use:Order can be changed for example:  This is useful if you are grabbing curl request from chrome inspector.\nSome time I simply use It displays some extra information but very easy to remember.Note: Some incorrectly configured/programmed web servers might response different then the post because it is a HEAD request not POST. But works most of the timeMuch easier \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0this is what I use to avoid Shortlink tracking \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0is the following:\xe2\x80\xa6which also follows links.While the other answers have not worked for me in all situations, the best solution I could find (working with POST as well), taken from here:curl -vs \'https://some-site.com\' 1> /dev/null
