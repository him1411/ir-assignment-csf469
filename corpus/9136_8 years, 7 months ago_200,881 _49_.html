I am using the datetime Python module.  I am looking to calculate the date 6 months from the current date. Could someone give me a little help doing this?The reason I want to generate a date 6 months from the current date is to produce a Review Date.  If the user enters data into the system it will have a review date of 6 months from the date they entered the data.  I found this solution to be good.  (This uses the python-dateutil extension)The advantage of this approach is that it takes care of issues with 28, 30, 31 days etc. This becomes very useful in handling business rules and scenarios (say invoice generation etc.)Well, that depends what you mean by 6 months from the current date.Using natural months:Using a banker\'s definition, 6*30:What do you mean by \'6 months\'. Is 2009-02-13 + 6 months == 2009-08-13 or is it 2009-02-13 + 6*30 days?More info about mx.DateTimeThere\'s no direct way to do it with Python\'s datetime.Check out the relativedelta type at python-dateutil. It allows you to specify a  time delta in months.This solution works correctly for December, which most of the answers on this page do not.\nYou need to first shift the months from base 1 (ie Jan = 1) to base 0 (ie Jan = 0) before using modulus ( % ) or integer division ( // ), otherwise November (11) plus 1 month gives you 12, which when finding the remainder ( 12 % 12 ) gives 0.(And dont suggest "(month % 12) + 1" or Oct + 1 = december!)However ... This doesnt account for problem like Jan 31 + one month. So we go back to the OP - what do you mean by adding a month? One soln is to backtrack until you get to a valid day, given that most people would presume the last day of jan, plus one month, equals the last day of Feb.\nThis will work on negative numbers of months too.\nProof:Dateutil package has implementation of such functionality. But be aware, that this will be naive, as others pointed already.I know this was for 6 months, however the answer shows in google for "adding months in python" if you are adding one month:this would count the days in the current month and add them to the current date, using 365/12 would ad 1/12 of a year can causes issues for short / long months if your iterating over the date.For beginning of month to month calculation:Just use the timetuple method to extract the months, add your months and build a new dateobject. If there is a already existing method for this I do not know it.The API is a bit clumsy, but works as an example. Will also obviously not work on corner-cases like 2008-01-31 + 1 month. :)So, here is an example of the dateutil.relativedelta which I found useful for iterating through the past year, skipping a month each time to the present date:As with the other answers, you have to figure out what you actually mean by "6 months from now."  If you mean "today\'s day of the month in the month six years in the future" then this would do:The QDate class of PyQt4 has an addmonths function.I have a better way to solve the \'February 31st\' problem:I think that it also works with negative numbers (to subtract months), but I haven\'t tested this very much.Modified the AddMonths() for use in Zope and handling invalid day numbers:How about this? Not using another library (dateutil) or timedelta?\nbuilding on vartec\'s answer I did this and I believe it works:I tried using timedelta, but because it is counting the days, 365/2 or 6*356/12 does not always translate to 6 months, but rather 182 days. e.g.I believe that we usually assume that 6 month\'s from a certain day will land on the same day of the month but 6 months later (i.e. 2015-03-10 --> 2015-09-10, Not 2015-09-08)I hope you find this helpful.I solved this problem like this:Modified Johannes Wei\'s answer in the case 1new_month = 121.  This works perfectly for me.  The months could be positive or negative.Yet another solution - hope someone will like it:This solution doesn\'t work for days 29,30,31 for all cases, so more robust solution is needed (which is not so nice anymore :) ):From this answer, see parsedatetime. Code example follows. More details: unit test with many natural-language -> YYYY-MM-DD conversion examples, and apparent parsedatetime conversion challenges/bugs.The above code generates the following from a MacOSX machine:given that your datetime variable is called date:Use the python datetime module to add a timedelta of six months to datetime.today() .http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.htmlYou will of course have to solve the issue raised by Johannes Wei\xc3\x9f-- what do you mean by 6 months?This is what I came up with. It moves the correct number of months and years but ignores days (which was what I needed in my situation).I use this function to change year and month but keep day:You should write:I think it would be safer to do something like this instead of manually adding days:my modification to tony diep\'s answer, possibly marginally more elegant:adds months according to a business needs interpretationRework of an earlier answer by user417751. Maybe not so pythonic way, but it takes care of different month lengths and leap years. In this case 31 January 2012 + 1 month = 29 February 2012. In this function, n can be positive or negative.Here\'s a example which allows the user to decide how to return a date where the day is greater than the number of days in the month.
