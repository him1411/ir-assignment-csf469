How can I create an Excel Spreadsheet with C# without requiring Excel to be installed on the machine that\'s running the code?You can use a library called ExcelLibrary. It\'s a free, open source library posted on Google Code:ExcelLibraryThis looks to be a port of the PHP ExcelWriter that you mentioned above. It will not write to the new .xlsx format yet, but they are working on adding that functionality in.It\'s very simple, small and easy to use. Plus it has a DataSetHelper that lets you use DataSets and DataTables to easily work with Excel data.ExcelLibrary seems to still only work for the older Excel format (.xls files), but may be adding support in the future for newer 2007/2010 formats. You can also use EPPlus, which works only for Excel 2007/2010 format files (.xlsx files).There are a few known bugs with each library as noted in the comments. In all, EPPlus seems to be the best choice as time goes on. It seems to be more actively updated and documented as well.Also, as noted by @\xd0\x90\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd1\x91\xd0\xbc\xd0\xa6\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2 below, EPPlus has support for Pivot Tables and ExcelLibrary may have some support (Pivot table issue in ExcelLibrary)Here are a couple links for quick reference:\nExcelLibrary - GNU Lesser GPL\nEPPlus - GNU Library General Public License (LGPL)Here some example code for ExcelLibrary:Here is an example taking data from a database and creating a workbook from it. Note that the ExcelLibrary code is the single line at the bottom:Creating the Excel file is as easy as that. You can also manually create Excel files, but the above functionality is what really impressed me.If you are happy with the xlsx format, try my codeplex project. EPPlus. Started it with the source from ExcelPackage, but today it\'s a total rewrite.\nSupports ranges, cell styling, charts, shapes, pictures, namesranges, autofilter and a lot of other stuff.I\'ve used with success the following open source projects:ExcelPackage for OOXML formats (Office 2007)NPOI for .XLS format (Office 2003). NPOI 2.0 (Alpha) also supports XLSX.Take a look at my blog posts:Creating Excel spreadsheets .XLS and .XLSX in C#NPOI with Excel Table and dynamic ChartAnd what about using Open XML SDK 2.0 for Microsoft Office?A few benefits:Links:You can use OLEDB to create and manipulate Excel files. Check this: Reading and Writing Excel using OLEDB. Typical example:EDIT - Some more links:The commercial solution, SpreadsheetGear for .NET will do it.You can see live ASP.NET (C# and VB) samples here and download an evaluation version here.Disclaimer: I own SpreadsheetGear LLCA few options I have used:If XLSX is a must: ExcelPackage is a good start but died off when the developer quit working on it. ExML picked up from there and added a few features. ExML isn\'t a bad option, I\'m still using it in a couple of production websites.For all of my new projects, though, I\'m using NPOI, the .NET port of Apache POI. \nNPOI 2.0 (Alpha) also supports XLSX.An extremely lightweight option may be to use HTML tables.  Just create head, body, and table tags in a file, and save it as a file with an .xls extension.  There are Microsoft specific attributes that you can use to style the output, including formulas.I realize that you may not be coding this in a web application, but here is an example of the composition of an Excel file via an HTML table.  This technique could be used if you were coding a console app, desktop app, or service.You can use ExcelXmlWriter\nhttp://www.carlosag.net/Tools/ExcelXmlWriter/It works fine.You actually might want to check out the interop classes. You say no OLE (which this isn\'t), but the interop classes are very easy to use.You might be impressed if you haven\'t tried them.Please be warned of Microsoft\'s stance on this:Microsoft does not currently\n  recommend, and does not support,\n  Automation of Microsoft Office\n  applications from any unattended,\n  non-interactive client application or\n  component (including ASP, ASP.NET,\n  DCOM, and NT Services), because Office\n  may exhibit unstable behavior and/or\n  deadlock when Office is run in this\n  environment.If you\'re creating Excel 2007/2010 files give this open source project a try: http://closedxml.codeplex.comIt provides an object oriented way to manipulate the files (similar to\n  VBA) without dealing with the hassles of XML Documents. It can be used\n  by any .NET language like C# and Visual Basic (VB).ClosedXML allows you to create Excel 2007/2010 files without the Excel\n  application. The typical example is creating Excel reports on a web\n  server:Here\'s a completely free C# library, which lets you export from a DataSet, DataTable or List<> into a genuine Excel 2007 .xlsx file, using the OpenXML libraries:http://mikesknowledgebase.com/pages/CSharp/ExportToExcel.htmFull source code is provided - free of charge - along with instructions, and a demo application.After adding this class to your application, you can export your DataSet to Excel in just one line of code:It doesn\'t get much simpler than that...And it doesn\'t even require Excel to be present on your server.You could consider creating your files using the XML Spreadsheet 2003 format. This is a simple XML format using a well documented schema.You may want to take a look at http://www.gemboxsoftware.com/GBSpreadsheetFree.htm.They have a free version with all features but limited to 150 rows per sheet and 5 sheets per workbook, if that falls within your needs.I haven\'t had need to use it myself yet, but does look interesting.The various Office 2003 XML libraries avaliable work pretty well for smaller excel files. However, I find the sheer size of a large workbook saved in the XML format to be a problem. For example, a workbook I work with that would be 40MB in the new (and admittedly more tightly packed) XLSX format becomes a 360MB XML file.As far as my research has taken me, there are two commercial packages that allow output to the older binary file formats. They are:Neither are cheap (500USD and 800USD respectively, I think). but both work independant of Excel itself.What I would be curious about is the Excel output module for the likes of OpenOffice.org. I wonder if they can be ported from Java to .Net.I agree about generating XML Spreadsheets, here\'s an example on how to do it for C# 3 (everyone just blogs about it in VB 9 :P) http://www.aaron-powell.com/linq-to-xml-to-excelSyncfusion Essential XlsIO can do this. It has no dependency on Microsoft office and also has specific support for different platforms.Code sample:The whole suite of controls is available for free through the community license program if you qualify (less than 1 million USD in revenue). Note: I work for Syncfusion.Just want to add another reference to a third party solution that directly addresses your issue:  http://www.officewriter.com(Disclaimer: I work for SoftArtisans, the company that makes OfficeWriter)Well,you can also use a third party library like Aspose.This library has the benefit that it does not require Excel to be installed on your machine which would be ideal in your case.I\'ve just recently used FlexCel.NET and found it to be an excellent library! I don\'t say that about too many software products. No point in giving the whole sales pitch here, you can read all the features on their website.It is a commercial product, but you get the full source if you buy it. So I suppose you could compile it into your assembly if you really wanted to. Otherwise it\'s just one extra assembly to xcopy - no configuration or installation or anything like that.I don\'t think you\'ll find any way to do this without third-party libraries as .NET framework, obviously, does not have built in support for it and OLE Automation is just a whole world of pain.Here\'s a way to do it with LINQ to XML, complete with sample code:Quickly Import and Export Excel Data with LINQ to XMLIt\'s a little complex, since you have to import namespaces and so forth, but it does let you avoid any external dependencies.(Also, of course, it\'s VB .NET, not C#, but you can always isolate the VB .NET stuff in its own project to use XML Literals, and do everything else in C#.)Some 3rd party component vendors like Infragistics or Syncfusion provide very good Excel export capabilities that do not require Microsoft Excel to be installed. Since these vendors also provide advanced UI grid components, these components are particularly handy if you want the style and layout of an excel export to mimic the current state of a grid in the user interface of your application.If your export is intended to be executed server side with emphasis on the data to be exported and with no link to the UI, then I would go for one of the free open source options (e.g. ExcelLibrary). I have previously been involved with projects that attempted to use server side automation on the Microsoft Office suite. Based on this experience I would strongly recommend against that approach. OpenXML is also a good alternative that helps avoid installing MS Excel on Server.The Open XML SDK 2.0 provided by Microsoft simplifies the task of manipulating Open XML packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package. The Open XML Application Programming Interface (API) encapsulates many common tasks that developers perform on Open XML packages.Check this out OpenXML: Alternative that helps avoid installing MS Excel on ServerIKVM + POIOr, you could use the Interop ...Hi this solution is to export your grid view to your excel file it might help you outYou can create nicely formatted Excel files using this library:\nhttp://officehelper.codeplex.com/documentation\n\nSee below sample:where sample look like this:Some useful Excel automation in C# , u can find from the following link.http://csharp.net-informations.com/excel/csharp-excel-tutorial.htmbolton.Look at samples how to create Excel files.There are examples in C# and VB.NETIt manages XSL XSLX and CSV Excel files.http://www.devtriogroup.com/ExcelJetcell/SamplesHave you ever tried sylk?We used to generate excelsheets in classic asp as sylk and right now we\'re searching for an excelgenerater too.The advantages for sylk are, you can format the cells. Look for ExtremeML. It\'s a pretty cool library which enables you to use the OpenXML format for generating OpenXML files.It\'s also an OpenSource project.http://www.extrememl.com/
