I\'m using AJAX to append data to div element, where I fill the div from JavaScript, how can I append new data to the div without losing the previous data found in div?Try this:Using appendChild:Using innerHTML:\nThis approach will remove all the listeners to the existing elements as mentioned by @BiAiB. So use caution if you are planning to use this version.Beware of innerHTML, you sort of lose something when you use it:Is equivalent to:Which will destroy all nodes inside your div and recreate new ones. All references and listeners to elements inside it will be lost.If you need to keep them (when you have attached a click handler, for example), you have to append the new contents with the DOM functions(appendChild,insertAfter,insertBefore):If you want to do it fast and don\'t want to lose references and listeners use: .insertAdjacentHTML();"It does not reparse the element it is being used on and thus it does not corrupt the existing elements inside the element. This, and avoiding the extra step of serialization make it much faster than direct innerHTML manipulation."Supported on all mainline browsers (IE6+, FF8+,All Others and Mobile): http://caniuse.com/#feat=insertadjacenthtmlExample from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTMLIf you are using jQuery you can use $(\'#mydiv\').append(\'html content\') and it will keep the existing content.http://api.jquery.com/append/Even this will work:you can use jQuery. which make it very simple.just download the jQuery file add jQuery into your HTML \nor you can user online link:and try this:IE9+ (Vista+) solution, without creating new text nodes:However, this didn\'t quite do the trick for me since I needed a new line after each message, so my DIV turned into a styled UL with this code:From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent :Differences from innerHTMLinnerHTML returns the HTML as its name indicates. Quite often, in order to retrieve or write text within an element, people use innerHTML. textContent should be used instead. Because the text is not parsed as HTML, it\'s likely to have better performance. Moreover, this avoids an XSS attack vector.Why not just use setAttribute ?Then you can get this data by : java scriptjqueryUse .html() without any arguments to see that you have entered.\nYou can use the browser console to quickly test these functions before using them in your code.
