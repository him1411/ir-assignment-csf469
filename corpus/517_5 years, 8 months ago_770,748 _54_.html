I\'ve got some poorly-formatted HTML code that I\'d like to reformat. Is there a command that will automatically reformat HTML code in Sublime Text 2 so it looks better and is easier to read?You don\'t need any plugins to do this.\nJust select all lines (Ctrl A) and then from the menu select Edit → Line → Reindent.\nThis will work if your file is saved with an extension that contains HTML like .html or .php.If you do this often, you may find this key mapping useful:If your file is not saved (e.g. you just pasted in a snippet to a new window), you can manually set the language for indentation by selecting the menu View → Syntax → language of choice before selecting the reindent option.There are half a dozen or so ways to format HTML in Sublime. I\'ve tested each of the most popular plugins (see the writeup I did on my blog for full details), but here\'s a quick overview of some of the most popular options:Pros:Cons:Pros:Cons:Pros:Cons:Pros:Cons:Pros:Cons:HTML-CSS-JS Prettify is the winner in my book. Lots of great features, not much to complain about.The only one package I\'ve been able to find is Tag.You can install it using the package control. https://sublime.wbond.netAfter installing package control. Go to package control (Preferences -> Package Control) then type install, hit enter. Then type tag and hit enter.After installing Tag, highlight the text and press the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F.I recommend this plugin: HTML/CSS/JS Prettify, It really works.After the installation, just select the code and press Ctrl+Shift+H.Done!Just a general tip. What I did to auto-tidy up my HTML, was install the package HTML_Tidy, and then add the following keybinding to the default settings (which I use):this runs HTML Tidy with every enter. There may be drawbacks to this, I\'m quite new to Sublime myself, but it seems to do what I want :)Altough the question is for HTML, I would also additionally like to give info about how to auto-format your Javascript code for Sublime Text 2;You can select all your code(ctrl + A) and use the in-app functionality, reindent(Edit -> Line -> Reindent) or you can use JsFormat formatting plugin for Sublime Text 2 if you would like to have more customizable settings on how to format your code to addition to the Sublime Text\'s default tab/indent settings. https://github.com/jdc0589/JsFormatYou can easily install JsFormat with using Package Control (Preferences -> Package Control) Open package control then type install, hit enter. Then type js format and hit enter, you\'re done. \n(The package controller will show the status of the installation with success and errors on the bottom left bar of Sublime)Add the following line to your key bindings (Preferences -> Key Bindings User) I\'m using ctrl + alt + 2, you can change this shortcut key whatever you want to. So far, JsFormat is a good plugin, worth to try it!Hope this will help someone.There\'s a plugin called SublimeHtmlTidy which works pretty well https://github.com/welovewordpress/SublimeHtmlTidySimply go toEdit -> Tag -> Auto-format tags on documentFor me, the HTML Prettify solution was extremely simple. I went to the HTML Prettify page. Boom. Done. Looks greatI created a Package called HTMLBeautify that does a decent job of reformatting HTML. I based it off of a Perl script I found back in 1997\xe2\x80\x94I updated it to work with all the new fangled modern tags. :)Check it out and let me know what you think!https://github.com/rareyman/HTMLBeautifyI am yet to have the privilege to comment so this is simply additional information related to @peter\'s answer above answer. I found HTML did not align as expected if IE conditional comments in the header were not completely in-line e.g. flush to the left:There is a nice open source CodeFormatter plugin, which(along reindenting) can beautify dirty code even all of it is in single line.I think this is what you\'re looking for: https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-HTMLPrettifyyou can set shortcut key F12 easy!!!see detail here.I\'m using tidy together with custom build system to prettify HTML.I have HTMLTidy.sublime-build in my Packages/User/ directory:and tidy_config.cfg file in the same directory:And just select build system and press ctrl+b or cmd+b to reformat file content. One minor issue with that is that ST2 does not automatically reload the file so to see the results you have to switch to some other file and back (or to other application and back).On Mac I\'ve used macports to install tidy, on Windows you\'d have to download it yourself and specify working directory in the build system, where tidy is located:or add it to the PATH.
