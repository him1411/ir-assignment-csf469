I am wondering how to convert an NSArray [@"Apple", @"Pear ", 323, @"Orange"] to a string in Objective-C.One approach would be to iterate over the array, calling the description message on each item:Another approach would be to do something based on each item\'s class:If you want commas and other extraneous information, you can just do:I think Sanjay\'s answer was almost there but i used it this way Output :As Sanjay had hinted - I used method componentsJoinedByString from NSArray that does joining and gives you back NSStringBTW NSString has reverse method componentsSeparatedByString that does the splitting and gives you NSArray back . I recently found a really good tutorial on Objective-C Strings: http://ios-blog.co.uk/tutorials/objective-c-strings-a-guide-for-beginners/And I thought that this might be of interest:If you want to split the string into an array use a method called componentsSeparatedByString to achieve this:if you need to split on a set of several different characters, use NSString\xe2\x80\x99s componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:Note however that the separator string can\xe2\x80\x99t be blank. If you need to separate a string into its individual characters, just loop through the length of the string and convert each char into a new string:and you have dic or multiple array then used bellow                            The way I know is easy.n is the inner position in the array\nThis in SWIFT Language. \nIt might work in Objective CSwift 3.0 solution:
