I have a gh-pages branch in one of my http://github.com repos. The GitHub project pages works fine if I go to http://myuser.github.com/myrepoI want to setup a custom domain (myexample.com) that will serve up this project pages.  I want both myexample.com and www.myexample.com to serve up these project pages.GitHub pages help says to make an A record and a CNAME record in your DNS.  The A record makes sense, but I do not know what CNAME record to make in my DNS.The gh-pages docs say to make a CNAME record for \'charlie.github.com\' which is a user page repository.  I do not have a user page repository - I only have a project repository and a gh-pages branch that I want to use for myexample.com and www.myexample.com.Do I need to make a user page repository just so I can use my project page for www.myexample.com and myexample.com?I would just try it, but I want to make sure this will work as I already have www.myexample.com live and don\'t want to make a mistake.I emailed GitHub support and their response wasYou can\'t have both point to the same gh-pages as far as I know.  I find it hard to believe they would only support A records for project pages.Has anyone successfully done this before?So I figured it out. James McLaughlin gave me the nudge I needed.To Setup a custom domain for a gh-pages Project Pages repo that handles www.yourdomain.com and yourdomain.com (assumes you already have a gh-pages branch on your repo):Wait til your name servers update:dig yourdomain.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmdThe documentation is a little confusing when it comes to project pages, as opposed to user pages. It feels like you should have to do more, but actually the process is very easy.It involves:Your content will be served from a URL of the form http://nicholasjohnson.com.Visiting http://www.nicholasjohnson.com will return a 301 redirect to the naked domain. The path will be respected by the redirect, so traffic to http://www.nicholasjohnson.com/angular will be redirected to http://nicholasjohnson.com/angular. You can have one project page per repository, so if your repos are open you can have as many as you like.Here\'s the process:For the A records, point @ to the following ip addresses:These are the static Github IP addresses from which your content will be served.For the CNAME record, point www to yourusername.github.io. Note the trailing full stop. Note also, this is the username, not the project name. You don\'t need to specify the project name yet. Github will use the CNAME file to determine which project to serve content from.e.g.The purpose of the CNAME is to redirect all www subdomain traffic to a GitHub page which will 301 redirect to the naked domain.Here\'s a screenshot of the configuration I use for my own site http://nicholasjohnson.com:Add a file called CNAME to your project root in the gh-pages branch. This should contain the domain you want to serve. Make sure you commit and push.e.g.This file tells GitHub to use this repo to handle traffic to this domain. Now wait 5 minutes, your project page should now be live.If you are wondering how to get your domain to appear as www.mydomain.com instead of redirecting the www request to\n  mydomain.com, try this:CNAME file on gh-pages branch will have one line:www.mydomain.com (instead of mydomain.com)No matter your preference on redirection (in other words, no matter what is in your CNAME file on the gs-pages branch), with your DNS provider, you should set it up like this:As of Aug 29, 2013, Github\'s documentation claim that:Warning: Project pages subpaths like http://username.github.io/projectname will not be redirected to a project\'s custom domain.These detailed explanations are great, but the OP\'s (and my) confusion could be resolved with one sentence: "Direct DNS to your GitHub username or organization, ignoring the specific project, and add the appropriate CNAME files in your project repositories: GitHub will send the right DNS to the right project based on files in the respository."I just discovered, after a bit of frustration, that if you\'re using PairNIC, all you have to do is enable the "Web Forwarding" setting under "Custom DNS" and supply the username.github.io/project address and it will automatically set up both the apex and subdomain records for you. It appears to do exactly what\'s suggested in the accepted answer. However, it won\'t let you do the exact same thing by manually adding records. Very strange. Anyway, it took me a while to figure that out, so I thought I\'d share to save everyone else the trouble.I\'d like to share my steps which is a bit different to what offered by rynop and superluminary. This configuration is referring to guidance of preferred domain. The domain setting of www to non www or vise versa can be different on each of the domain providers. Since my domain is under GoDaddy, so under the  Domain Setting I set it using the Subdomain Forwarding (301).  As the result of pointing the domain to Github repository, it will then give all the URLs for both of master and gh-pages branch similar like the ones I listed below goes to the preferred domain:master By creating CNAME file on master branch (check it on my user repository).http://hyipworld.github.io/\n  http://www.hyip.world/\n  http://hyip.world/gh-pages By creating  the same CNAME file on gh-pages branch (check it on my project  repository).http://hyipworld.github.io/maps/\n  http://www.hyip.world/maps/\n  http://hyip.world/maps/ As addition to the CNAME file above, you may need to completely bypass Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages by creating a file named .nojekyll in the root of your pages repo.
