How do you change the text value of a button in jQuery?  Currently my button has \'Add\' as it\'s text value, and upon being clicked I want it to change to \'Save\'.  I have tried this method below, but so far without success :Depends on what type of button you are usingYour button could also be a link. You\'ll need to post some HTML for a more specific answer. EDIT : These will work assuming you\'ve wrapped it in a .click() call, of courseEDIT 2 : Newer jQuery versions (from > 1.6) use .prop rather than .attrEDIT 3 : If you\'re using jQuery UI, you need to use DaveUK\'s method (below) of adjusting the text property For buttons created with .Button() in jQuery........Whilst the other answers will change the text they will mess up the styling of the button, it turns out that when a jQuery button is rendered the text of the button is nested within a span e.g.If you remove the span and replace it with text (as in the other examples) - you\'ll loose the span and associated formatting.So you actually need to change the text within the SPAN tag and NOT the BUTTON!or (if like me it\'s being done on a click event)The correct way of changing the button text if it was "buttonized" using JQuery is to use .button() method:Use .val()Here\'s a link to JSfiddleTo change the text in of a button simply execute the following line of jQuery\nfor<input type=\'button\' value=\'XYZ\' id=\'btnAddProfile\'>usewhile for<button id=\'btnAddProfile\'>XYZ</button>use this$("#btnAddProfile").html(\'Save\');You need to do .button("refresh")HTML :JS :If you have button\'ed your button this seems to work:$("#btnAddProfile").text("Save");You can usealthoughwould work as well, but it\'s misleading (it gives the impression you could write something like but of course you can\'tit\'s work for me\nhtml:jsYou can use something like this:You can also add extra properties like this:Have you gave your button a class instead of an id? try the following codeThis should do the trick:that\'s exactly correct, this works for me;are you sure Jquery is available and that your code is in the correct place?
