Two-part question from an iOS developer learning Android, working on an Android project that will make a variety of requests from JSON to image to streaming download of audio and video:On iOS I have used the AFNetworking project extensively. Is there an equivalent library for Android?I\'ve read up on OkHTTP and Retrofit by Square, as well as Volley but dont yet have experience developing with them. I\'m hoping someone can provide some concrete examples of best use cases for each. From what I\'ve read, seems like OkHTTP is the most robust of the three, and could handle the requirements of this project (mentioned above).I\'m hoping someone can provide some concrete examples of best use cases for each.Use Retrofit if you are communicating with a Web service. Use the peer library Picasso if you are downloading images. Use OkHTTP if you need to do HTTP operations that lie outside of Retrofit/Picasso.Volley roughly competes with Retrofit + Picasso. On the plus side, it is one library. On the minus side, it is one undocumented, an unsupported, "throw the code over the wall and do an I|O presentation on it" library.EDIT - Volley is now officially supported by Google. Kindly refer Google Developer GuideFrom what I\'ve read, seems like OkHTTP is the most robust of the 3Retrofit uses OkHTTP automatically if available. There is a Gist from Jake Wharton that connects Volley to OkHTTP.and could handle the requirements of this project (mentioned above).Probably you will use none of them for "streaming download of audio and video", by the conventional definition of "streaming". Instead, Android\'s media framework will handle those HTTP requests for you.That being said, if you are going to attempt to do your own HTTP-based streaming, OkHTTP should handle that scenario; I don\'t recall how well Volley would handle that scenario. Neither Retrofit nor Picasso are designed for that.Looking at the Volley perspective here is some advantage for your requirement:Volley, on the other hand, is totally focused on handling individual, small HTTP requests. So if your HTTP request handling has some quirks, Volley probably has a hook for you. If, on the other hand, you have a quirk in your image handling, the only real hook you have is ImageCache. "It\xe2\x80\x99s not nothing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot!, either". but it have more other advantages like Once you define your requests, using them from within a fragment or activity is painless unlike parallel AsyncTasksPros and cons of Volley:So what\xe2\x80\x99s nice about Volley?The networking part isn\xe2\x80\x99t just for images. Volley is intended to be\nan integral part of your back end. For a fresh project based off of a\nsimple REST service, this could be a big win.NetworkImageView is more aggressive about request cleanup than\nPicasso, and more conservative in its GC usage patterns.\nNetworkImageView relies exclusively on strong memory references, and\ncleans up all request data as soon as a new request is made for an\nImageView, or as soon as that ImageView moves offscreen.Performance. This post won\xe2\x80\x99t evaluate this claim, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve clearly\ntaken some care to be judicious in their memory usage patterns.\nVolley also makes an effort to batch callbacks to the main thread to\nreduce context switching.Volley apparently has futures, too. Check out RequestFuture if you\xe2\x80\x99re\ninterested.If you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with high-resolution compressed images, Volley is\nthe only solution here that works well.Volley can be used with Okhttp (New ver of Okhttp supports NIO for better performance )Volley plays nice with the Activity life cycle. Problems With Volley:\nSince Volley is new few things are not supported yet, but it\'s fixed.Multipart Requests (Solution: https://github.com/vinaysshenoy/enhanced-volley)status code 201 is taken as an error,  Status code from 200 to 207 are successful responses now.(Fixed: https://github.com/Vinayrraj/CustomVolley)Update: in latest release Google volley the 2XX Status codes bug is fixed now!Thanks to Ficus Kirkpatrick!it\'s less documented but many of the people supporting this volley in github, java like documentation can be found here. \nOn android developer website, you may find guide for Transmitting Network Data Using Volley. And volley source code can be found at Google GitTo solve/change Redirect Policy of Volley Framework use  Volley with OkHTTP (CommonsWare mentioned above) Also you can read this Comparing Volley\'s image loading with PicassoRetrofit:It\'s released by Square, This offers very easy to use REST API\'s (Update: Voila! with NIO support)Pros of Retrofit:Compared to Volley in this REST API code is brief and provides\nexcellent API documentation and have good support in communities!\nVery easy to add into the projects.We can use with any serialization library, with error handling.Update:\n - There are plenty of very good changes in Retrofit 2.0.0-beta2Cons of Retrofit for version 1.6:Memory error handling is not good (in older versions of Retrofit/OkHttp) not sure it\'s improved with the Okio with Java NIO support. Minimum threading assistance can result call back hell if we use this\nin an improper way.(All above Cons solved in the new version of Retrofit 2.0 beta) ========================================================================Update:Android Async vs Volley vs Retrofit performance benchmarks (milliseconds, lower value is better):(FYI above Retrofit Benchmarks info will become improve with java NIO support because now new OKhttp is dependent on NIO Okio library) In all three tests with varying repeats (1 \xe2\x80\x93 25 times), Volley was\n  anywhere from 50% to 75% faster. Retrofit clocked in at an impressive\n  50% to 90% faster than the AsyncTasks, hitting the same endpoint the\n  same number of times. On the Dashboard test suite, this translated\n  into loading/parsing the data several seconds faster. That is a\n  massive real-world difference. In order to make the tests fair, the\n  times for AsyncTasks/Volley included the JSON parsing as Retrofit does\n  it for you automatically.RetroFit Wins in benchmark test!In the end, we decided to go with Retrofit for our application. Not\n  only is it ridiculously fast, but it meshes quite well with our\n  existing architecture. We were able to make a parent Callback\n  Interface that automatically handles the error function, caching, and\n  pagination with little to no effort for our APIs. In order to merge in\n  Retrofit, we have to rename our variables to make our models GSON\n  compliant, write a few simple interfaces, delete functions from the\n  old API, and modify our fragments to not use AsyncTasks. Now that we\n  have a few fragments completely converted, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty painless. There\n  were some growing pains and issues that we had to overcome, but\n  overall it went smoothly. In the beginning, we ran into a few\n  technical issues/bugs, but Square has a fantastic Google+ community\n  that was able to help us through it.When to use Volley?! We can use Volley when we need both image loading and REST API  is needed!, network call queuing system is needed for many n/w request at the same time! also Volley have better memory error handling than Retrofit!OkHttp can be used with Volley, in Retrofit it uses OkHttp by default! It has SPDY support, connection pooling, disk caching, transparent compression! Recently, it has got some support of java NIO with Okio library.Source, credit: volley-vs-retrofit by Mr. Josh RueschNote: About streaming it depends on what type of streaming you want like RTSP/RTCP. RoboSpice Vs. Volley From https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/robospice/QwVCfY_glOQAsync HTTP client loopj vs. VolleyThe specifics of my project are small HTTP REST requests, every 1-5 minutes.I using an async HTTP client (1.4.1) for a long time. The performance is better than using the vanilla Apache httpClient or an HTTP URL connection. Anyway, the new version of the library is not working for me: library inter exception cut chain of callbacks.Reading all answers motivated me to try something new. I have chosen the Volley HTTP library.After using it for some time, even without tests, I see clearly that the response time is down to 1.5x, 2x Volley.Maybe Retrofit is better than an async HTTP client? I need to try it.\nBut I\'m sure that Volley is not for me.AFNetworking for Android:Fast Android Networking is here Fast Android Networking Library supports all types of HTTP/HTTPS request like GET, POST, DELETE, HEAD, PUT, PATCHFast Android Networking Library supports downloading any type of fileFast Android Networking Library supports uploading any type of file (supports multipart upload)Fast Android Networking Library supports cancelling a requestFast Android Networking Library supports setting priority to any request (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, IMMEDIATE)Fast Android Networking Library supports RxJavaAs it uses OkHttp as a networking layer, it supports:Fast Android Networking Library supports HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socketFast Android Networking Library uses connection pooling which reduces request latency (if HTTP/2 isn\xe2\x80\x99t available)Transparent GZIP shrinks download sizesFast Android Networking Library supports response caching which avoids the network completely for repeat requestsThanks: The library is created by meJust to add a bit to the discussion from my experience working with Volley:Volley does not handle streaming uploads or downloads in any sense. That is, the entire request body has to be in memory and you cannot use an OutputStream to write the request body to the underlying socket, nor can you use an InputStream to read the response body, as basic HttpURLConnection does. So, Volley is a poor choice for uploading or downloading large files. Your requests and responses should be small. This is one of the biggest limitations of Volley that I have personally encountered. For what it\'s worth, OkHttp does have interfaces for working with streams.The lack of official documentation is annoying, although I have been able to work around that by reading the source code, which is pretty easy to follow. What is more bothersome is that, as far as I can tell, Volley has no official release versions and no Maven or Gradle artifact, and therefore managing it as a dependency becomes more of a headache than, say, any of the libraries Square has released. You just clone a repo, build a jar, and you\'re on your own. Looking for a bug fix? Fetch and hope it\'s there. You might get some other stuff, too; it won\'t be documented. In my opinion, this effectively means that Volley is an unsupported 3rd party library, even though the code base is reasonably active. Caveat emptor.As a nit, having the Content-Type tied to the class/request type (JsonObjectRequest, ImageRequest, etc.) is kind of awkward and reduces the flexibility of the calling code a bit, as you are tied to Volley\'s existing Request type hierarchy. I like the straightforwardness of just setting Content-Type as a header like any other (don\'t do this with Volley, by the way; you\'ll end up with two Content-Type headers!). That\'s just my personal opinion, though, and it can be worked around.That is not to say that Volley does not have some useful features. It certainly does. Easily customizable retry policies, transparent caching, a cancellation API, and support for request scheduling and concurrent connections are great features. Just know that it\'s not intended for all HTTP use cases (see item 1 above), and that there are some headaches involved in putting Volley into production use in your app (item 2).I\'ve recently found a lib called ion that brings a little extra to the table. ion has built-in support for image download integrated with ImageView, JSON (with the help of GSON), files and a very handy UI threading support.I\'m using it on a new project and so far the results have been good. Its use is much simpler than Volley or Retrofit.Adding to the accepted answer and what LOG_TAG said....for Volley to parse your data in a background thread you must subclass Request<YourClassName> as the onResponse method is called on the main thread and parsing on the main thread may cause the UI to lag if your response is big.\nRead here on how to do that.I am using both in my app.Robospice works faster than Retrofit whenever I parse the nested JSON class. Because Spice Manger will do everything for you. In Retrofit you need to create GsonConverter and deserialize it.I created two fragments in the same activity and called the same time with two same kind of URLs.And yet another option:\nhttps://github.com/apptik/jusAnd many other handy features like markers, transformers, etc.
