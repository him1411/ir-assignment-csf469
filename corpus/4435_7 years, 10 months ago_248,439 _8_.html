I have been seeing code like this usually in the start of header files:And at the end of the file isWhat is the purpose of this?Those are called #include guards.Once the header is included, it checks if a unique value (in this case HEADERFILE_H) is defined. Then if it\'s not defined, it defines it and continues to the rest of the page.When the code is included again, the first ifndef fails, resulting in a blank file.That prevents double declaration of any identifiers such as types, enums and static variables.#ifndef checks whether the given token has been #defined earlier in the file or in an included file; if not, it includes the code between it and the closing #else or, if no #else is present, #endif statement. #ifndef is often used to make header files idempotent by defining a token once the file has been included and checking that the token was not set at the top of that file.
