In my answer to SO question 4314376, I recommended using ez_setup so that you could then install pip and virtualenv as follows:I originally pulled these instructions from Jesse Noller\'s blog post So you want to use Python on the Mac?. I like the idea of keeping a clean global site-packages directory, so the only other packages I install there are  virtualenvwrapper and distribute. (I recently added distribute to my toolbox because of this Python public service announcement. To install these two packages, I used:To really follow that Python public service announcement, on a fresh Python install, I would do the following:In a comment to my answer to SO question 4314376, SO user Glyph stated:NO. NEVER EVER do sudo python setup.py install whatever. Write a ~/.pydistutils.cfg that puts your pip installation into ~/.local or something. Especially files named ez_setup.py tend to suck down newer versions of things like setuptools and easy_install, which can potentially break other things on your operating system.So Glyph\'s response leads me to my original question:You can do this without installing anything into python itself.You don\'t need sudo or any privileges.You don\'t need to edit any files.Install virtualenv into a bootstrap virtual environment. Use the that virtual environment to create more. Since virtualenv ships with pip and distribute, you get everything from one install.Here is an example in bash:Now you can use your "bootstrap" environment to create more:Go nuts!This assumes you are not using a really old version of virtualenv.\nOld versions required the flags --no-site-packges (and depending on the version of Python, --distribute). Now you can create your bootstrap environment with just python virtualenv.py path-to-bootstrap or python3 virtualenv.py path-to-bootstrap.I think Glyph means do something like this:Create a file ~/.pydistutils.cfg which contains It\'s a standard ConfigParser-format file.Download distribute_setup.py and run python distribute_setup.py (no sudo). If it complains about a non-existing site-packages directory, create it manually:mkdir -p ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Run which easy_install to verify that it\'s coming from ~/.local/binIn ~/.bashrc addThat\'s it, no use of sudo at all and your Python environment is in ~/.local, completely separate from the OS\'s Python. Disclaimer: Not sure how compatible virtualenvwrapper is in this scenario - I couldn\'t test it on my system :-)If you follow the steps advised in several tutorials I linked in this answer, you\ncan get the desired effect without the somewhat complicated "manual" steps in Walker\'s and Vinay\'s answers. If you\'re on Ubuntu:The equivalent is achieved in OS X by using homebrew to install python (more details here).With pip installed, you can use it to get the remaining packages (you can omit sudo in OS X, as you\'re using your local python installation).(these are the only packages you need installed globally and I doubt that it will clash with anything system-level from the OS. If you want to be super-safe, you can keep the distro\'s versions sudo apt-get install virtualenvwrapper)Note: in Ubuntu 14.04 I receive some errors with pip install, so I use pip3 install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper and add VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3 to my .bashrc/.zshrc file.You then append to your .bashrc fileand source itThis is basically it. Now the only decision is whether you want to create a virtualenv to include system-level packageswhere your existing system packages don\'t have to be reinstalled, they are symlinked to the system interpreter\'s versions. Note: you can still install new packages and upgrade existing included-from-system packages without sudo - I tested it and it works without any disruptions of the system interpreter.The alternative, if you want a completely separated environment, isor given that this is the default option, simplyThe result is that you have a new virtualenv where you can freely and sudolessly install your favourite packagesPython 3.3 adds the venv module, and Python 3.4 adds the ensurepip module.  This makes bootstrapping pip as easy as:python -m ensurepipPerhaps preceded by a call to venv to do so inside a virtual environment.Guaranteed pip is described in PEP 453.On Ubuntu:sudo apt-get install python-virtualenvThe package python-pip is a dependency, so it will be installed as well.Update: As of July 2013 this project is no longer maintained. The author suggests using pyenv. (pyenv does not have built-in support for virtualenv, but plays nice with it.)Pythonbrew is a version manager for python and comes with support for virtualenv.After installing pythonbrew and a python-version using venvs is really easy:I made this procedure for us to use at work. Key points for the security minded:There is no problem to do sudo python setup.py install, if you\'re sure it\'s what you want to do.The difference is that it will use the site-packages directory of your OS as a destination for .py files to be copied.so, if you want pip to be accessible os wide, that\'s probably the way to go. I do not say that others way are bad, but this is probably fair enough.Install ActivePython. It includes pip, virtualenv and Distribute.I came across the same problem recently.  I\xe2\x80\x99m becoming more partial to the \xe2\x80\x9calways use a virtualenv\xe2\x80\x9d mindset, so my problem was to install virtualenv with pip without installing distribute to my global or user site-packages directory.  To do this, I manually downloaded distribute, pip and virtualenv, and for each one I ran \xe2\x80\x9cpython setup.py install --prefix ~/.local/python-private\xe2\x80\x9d (with a temporary setting of PYTHONPATH=~/.local/python-private) so that setup scripts were able to find distribute).  I\xe2\x80\x99ve moved the virtualenv script to another directory I have on my PATH and edited it so that the distribute and virtualenv modules can be found on sys.path.  Tada: I did not install anything to /usr, /usr/local or my user site-packages dir, but I can run virtualenv anywhere, and in that virtualenv I get pip.You can do this without installing anything into python itself.You don\'t need sudo or any privileges.You don\'t need to find the latest version of a virtualenv tar fileYou don\'t need to edit version info in a bash script to keep things up-to-date.You don\'t need curl/wget or tar installed, nor pip or easy_installSave the following to /tmp/initvenv.py:and use it ase.g. (if you really need the distribute compatibility layer for setuptools)Please note that, with older python versions, this might give you InsecurePlatformWarnings\xc2\xb9. Once you have your virtualenv (name e.g. venv) you can setup another virtualenv by using the virtualenv just installed:I recommend taking a look at virtualenvwrapper as well, after a one time setup:and activation (can be done from your login script):you can do things like:\xc2\xb9 I have not found a way to suppress the warning. It could be solved in pip and/or request, but the developers point to each other as the cause. I got the, often non-realistic, recommendation to upgrade the python version I was using to the latest version. I am sure this would break e.g my Linux Mint 17 install. Fortunately pip caches packages, so the Warning is made\nonly once per package install.I\'ve had various problems (see below) installing upgraded SSL modules, even inside a virtualenv,  on top of older OS-provided Python versions, so I now use pyenv.pyenv makes it very easy to install a new Python versions and supports virtualenvs.  Getting started is much easier than the recipes for virtualenv listed in other answers:This works very well to insulate the "new Python" version and virtualenv from system Python.  Because you can easily use a more recent Python (post 2.7.9), the SSL modules are already upgraded, and of course like any modern virtualenv setup you are insulated from the system Python modules.A couple of nice tutorials:The pyenv-virtualenv plugin is now built in - type pyenv commands | grep virtualenv to check.  I wouldn\'t use the pyenv-virtualenvwrapper plugin to start with - see how you get on with pyenv-virtualenv which is more integrated into pyenv, as this covers most of what virtualenvwrapper does.pyenv is modelled on rbenv (a good tool for Ruby version switching) and its only dependency is bash.Two warnings about pyenv:Hence pyenv is best for interactive use, and less good for scripting servers.One reason to use pyenv is that there are often problems with upgrading Python SSL modules when using older system-provided Python versions:There are good instructions on the Virtualenv official site. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv Basically what I did, is install pip with sudo easy_install pip, then used sudo pip install virtualenv then created an environment with: virtualenv my_env (name it what you want), following that I did: virtualenv --distribute my_env; which installed distribute and pip in my virtualenv. Again, follow the instruction on the virtualenv page.Kind of a hassle, coming from Ruby ;PDownload virtualenv-1.11.4 (you can find latest at here), Unzip it,  open terminalThat is it, now you can use mkvirtualenv env1, lsvirtualenv ..etcNote: you can delete virtualenv-1.11.4 and virtualenv-1.11.4.zip from Downloads folders.The good news is if you have installed python3.4, pyvenv is already been installed. So, JustNow in this virtual env, you can use pip to install modules for this project.Leave this virtual env , just
