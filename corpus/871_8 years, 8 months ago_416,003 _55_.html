By default Eclipse indents with a hard tab character. How do I change it to spaces?[Note: If necessary save profile with a new name as the default profile cannot be overwritten.]Before version 3.6:Version 3.6 and later:Note that the default text editor is used as the basis for many non-Java editors in Eclipse.

This applies the given formatting to a file. I do not know the same keybinding on windows, but give that a try. At that point I begin getting the expected behavior.I found the solution this problem very simple and which works always. It is change the eclipse setting file.Add/Change to line in file:indentationChar=spaceindentationSize=4Be sure to check the java formater since it overwrites the "insert spaces for tabs" setting.
