How can I get the current time and date in an Android app?You could use:There are plenty of constants in Calendar for everything you need.\nEdit: Calendar class documentationYou can (but no longer should - see below!) use android.text.format.Time:From the reference linked above:The Time class is a faster replacement\n  for the java.util.Calendar and\n  java.util.GregorianCalendar classes.\n  An instance of the Time class\n  represents a moment in time, specified\n  with second precision.NOTE 1:\nIt\'s been several years since I wrote this answer,\nand it is about an old, Android-specific and now deprecated class.\nGoogle now says that\n"[t]his class has a number of issues and it is recommended that GregorianCalendar is used instead".NOTE 2: Even though the Time class has a toMillis(ignoreDaylightSavings) method, this is merely a convenience to pass to methods that expect time in milliseconds. The time value is only precise to one second; the milliseconds portion is always 000.  If in a loop you doThe resulting sequence will repeat the same value, such as 1410543204000, until the next second has started, at which time 1410543205000 will begin to repeat.If you want to get the date and time in a specific pattern you can use the following:For those who might rather prefer a customized format, you can use:Whereas you can have DateFormat patterns such as:Actually, it\'s safer to set the current timezone set on the device with Time.getCurrentTimezone(), or else you will get the current time in UTC.Then, you can get all the date fields you want, like, for example:See android.text.format.Time class for all the details.UPDATEAs many people are pointing out, Google says this class has a number of issues and is not supposed to be used anymore:This class has a number of issues and it is recommended that\n  GregorianCalendar is used instead.Known issues:For historical reasons when performing time calculations all\n  arithmetic currently takes place using 32-bit integers. This limits\n  the reliable time range representable from 1902 until 2037.See the\n  wikipedia article on the Year 2038 problem for details. Do not rely on\n  this behavior; it may change in the future. Calling\n  switchTimezone(String) on a date that cannot exist, such as a wall\n  time that was skipped due to a DST transition, will result in a date\n  in 1969 (i.e. -1, or 1 second before 1st Jan 1970 UTC). Much of the\n  formatting / parsing assumes ASCII text and is therefore not suitable\n  for use with non-ASCII scripts.For the current date and time, use:Which outputs:To ge the current time you can use System.currentTimeMillis() which is standard in Java. Then you can use it to create a dateAnd as mentioned by others to create a timeTry with this way All formats are given below to get date and time format.\nYou can use the code:Output:You also get some more formatting options for SimpleDateFormat from here.Easy, you can dissect the time to get separate values for current time, as follows:Same goes for the date, as follows:There are several options as Android is mainly Java, but if you wish to write it in a textView, the following code would do the trick:The other Answers, while correct, are outdated. The old date-time classes have proven to be poorly designed, confusing, and troublesome. Those old classes have been supplanted by the java.time framework. These new classes are inspired by the highly successful Joda-Time project, defined by JSR 310, and extended by the ThreeTen-Extra project.See the Oracle Tutorial.An Instant is a moment on the timeline in UTC with resolution up to nanoseconds.Apply a time zone (ZoneId) to get a ZonedDateTime. If you omit the time zone your JVM\xe2\x80\x99s current default time zone is implicitly applied. Better to specify explicitly the desired/expected time zone.Use proper time zone names in the format of continent/region such as America/Montreal, Europe/Brussels, or Asia/Kolkata. Never use the 3-4 letter abbreviations such as EST or IST as they are neither standardized nor unique.You can easily generate a String as a textual representation of the date-time value. You can go with a standard format, your own custom format, or an automatically localized format.You can call the toString methods to get text formatted using the common and sensible ISO 8601 standard. 2016-03-23T03:09:01.613ZNote that for ZonedDateTime, the toString method extends the ISO 8601 standard by appending the name of the time zone in square brackets. Extremely useful and important information, but not standard.2016-03-22T20:09:01.613-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]Or specify your own particular formatting pattern with the DateTimeFormatter class.Specify a Locale for a human language (English, French, etc.) to use in translating the name of day/month and also in defining cultural norms such as the order of year and month and date. Note that Locale has nothing to do with time zone. Better yet, let java.time do the work of localizing automatically. The java.time framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old legacy date-time classes such as java.util.Date, .Calendar, & java.text.SimpleDateFormat.The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration to java.time.To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial. And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is JSR 310.Where to obtain the java.time classes? The ThreeTen-Extra project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time. You may find some useful classes here such as Interval, YearWeek, YearQuarter, and more.Date format PatternsYou can also use android.os.SystemClock.\nFor example SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() will give you more accurate time readings when the phone is asleep.This will give you, for example, 12:32.Remember to import android.text.format.Time;You can obtain the date by using:This will give you a result in a nice form, as in this example: "2014/02/09".For a customized time and date format: Output is like below format: \n2015-06-18T10:15:56-05:00Try this works for me as well.This is a method that will be useful to get date and time:You can call this method and get the current date and time values:If you need current date,If you need current time,you can simply use the following code:You should use Calender class according to new API. Date class is deprecated now.Try ThisTry this code it display current date and timetry to use below code:To get the short date formatted String in the localised format of the unit. I can\'t understand why so many answers are hardcoded date and time formats when the OS/Java supplies correct localisation of Dates and time? Isn\'t it better always use the formats of the unit than of the programmer? It also supplies the reading of dates in localised formats:Then it is up to the user setting the format to show the dates and time and not you? Regardless languages etc there are different formats in different countries with the same language. There is a ISO8601Utils utils class in com.google.gson.internal.bind.util package so if you use GSON in your app you can use this. It supports millis and timezones so it\'s a pretty good option right out of the box.
