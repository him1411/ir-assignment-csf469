I have a layout with two columns - a left div and a right div.The right div has a grey background-color, and I need it to expand vertically depending on the height of the user\'s browser window.  Right now the background-color ends at the last piece of content in that div. I\'ve tried height:100%, min-height:100%; etc.There are a couple of relatively new CSS3 measurement units called:From the linked W3 Candidate Recommendation above:The viewport-percentage lengths are relative to the size of the initial containing block. When the height or width of the initial containing block is changed, they are scaled accordingly.These units are vh (viewport height), vw (viewport width), vmin (viewport minimum length) and vmax (viewport maximum length).For this question, we can make use of vh: 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport\'s height. That is to say, 100vh is equal to the height of the browser window, regardless of where the element is situated in the DOM tree:This is literally all that\'s needed. Here is a JSFiddle example of this in use.This is currently supported on all up-to-date major browsers apart from Opera Mini. Check out Can I use... for further support.In the case of the question at hand, featuring a left and a right divider, here is a JSFiddle example showing a two-column layout involving both vh and vw.Take this layout for example:The p tag here is set to 100% height, but because its containing div has 200px height, 100% of 200px becomes 200px, not 100% of the body height. Using 100vh instead means that the p tag will be 100% height of the body regardless of the div height. Take a look at this accompanying Fiddle to easily see the difference!If you want to set the height of a <div> or any element, you should set the height of <body> and <html> to 100% too. Then you can set the height of element with 100% :)Here is an example:If you\xe2\x80\x99re able to absolutely position your elements,would do it.You can use the view-port unit in CSS :\nHTML :CSS :All the other solutions, including the top-voted one with vh are sub-optimal when compared to the flex model solution.With the advent of the CSS flex model, solving the 100% height problem becomes very, very easy: use height: 100%; display: flex on the parent, and flex: 1 on the child elements. They\'ll automatically take up all the available space in their container.Note how simple the markup and the CSS are. No table hacks or anything.The flex model is supported by all major browsers as well as IE11+.Learn more about the flex model here.You don\'t mention a few important details like:Here\'s one possibility:There are many variations on this depending on which columns need to be fixed and which are liquid. You can do this with absolute positioning too but I\'ve generally found better results (particularly in terms of cross-browser) using floats instead.Here\'s a fix for the height.In your CSS use:For browser that don\'t support vh-units, use modernizr.Add this script (to add detection for vh-units)Finally use this function to add the height of the viewport to #your-object if the browser doesn\'t support vh-units:This is what worked for me:Use position:fixed instead of position:absolute, that way even if you scroll down the division will expand to the end of the screen.Add min-height: 100% and don\'t specify a height (or put it on auto). It totally did the job for me:This worked for me:Taken from this page.There are several methods available for setting the height of a <div> to 100%.Method (A):Method (B) using vh:Method (c) using flex box:Try to set height:100% in html & body And if you want to 2 div height same use or set the parent element display:flex property.You can use vh in this case which is relative to 1% of the height of the viewport.That means if you want to cover off the height, just use 100vh.Look at the image I draw for you here:Try the snippet I created for you as below:Use FlexBox CSSFlexbox is a perfect fit for this type of problem. While mostly known for laying out content in the horizontal direction, Flexbox actually works just as well for vertical layout problems. All you have to do is wrap the vertical sections in a flex container and choose which ones you want to expand. They\xe2\x80\x99ll automatically take up all the available space in their container.One of the options is using CSS table. It has great browser support, even works in IE8.JSFiddle ExampleYou need to do two things, one is to set the height to 100% which you already did. Second is set the position to absolute. That should do the trick.SourceIf you use position: absolute; and jQuery, you could useTry this - tested:Try the following css :You can use JavaScript to dynamically calculate the height in the browser. For example, use CSS-IN-JS technology as provided by the CSSOBJ library.Demo: https://cssobj.github.io/cssobj-demo/Even though this solution is done with jQuery I though it may be useful for anyone doing columns to fit the screen size.For columns starting at the top of the page, this solution is the simplest.For columns that are not starting at the top of the page (for example: if they are starting below the header).First method applies the body height to it and the columns as well, which means that is starting_pixels + height100%.The second method gets the height of page shown to the user by getting the height of the body and then subtracts the header size to know how much height is left to display the column. Easiest:Do This:I have kept the position fixed because in absolute positioning, when the body is scrolled, it reveals that it does not cover the entire height of the window.If you still want to do it with absolute positioning then you might have to use a little bit of jQuery to calculate the height of the document and then set that height to the right div, like this:Here is something that is not exactly like what you had above but could be helpful to some. https://jsfiddle.net/newdark/qyxkk558/10/
