I\'m trying to learn Gson and I\'m struggling with field exclusion. Here are my classesI can use the GsonBuilder and add an ExclusionStrategy for a field name like firstName or country but I can\'t seem to manage to exclude properties of certain fields like country.name.Using the method public boolean shouldSkipField(FieldAttributes fa), FieldAttributes doesn\'t contain enough information to match the field with a filter like country.name.I would appreciate any help with a solution for this problem.P.S: I want to avoid annotations since I want to improve on this and use RegEx to filter fields out.Thank youEdit: I\'m trying to see if it\'s possible to emulate the behavior of Struts2 JSON pluginusing GsonEdit:\n    I reopened the question with the following addition:I added a second field with the same type to futher clarify this problem. Basically I want to exclude country.name but not countrOfBirth.name. I also don\'t want to exclude Country as a type.\nSo the types are the same it\'s the actual place in the object graph that I want to pinpoint and exclude.Any fields you don\'t want serialized in general you should use the "transient" modifier, and this also applies to json serializers (at least it does to a few that I have used, including gson).If you don\'t want name to show up in the serialized json give it a transient keyword, eg:More details in the Gson documentationNishant provided a good solution, but there\'s an easier way. Simply mark the desired fields with the @Expose annotation, such as:Leave out any fields that you do not want to serialize. Then just create your Gson object this way:So, you want to exclude firstName and country.name. Here is what your ExclusionStrategy should look likeIf you see closely it returns true for Student.firstName and Country.name, which is what you want to exclude.You need to apply this ExclusionStrategy like this,This returns:{"middleName":"J.","initials":"P.F","lastName":"Fry","country":{"id":91}}I assume the country object is initialized with id = 91L in student class.You may get fancy. For example, you do not want to serialize any field that contains "name" string in it\'s name. Do thisthis will return{"initials":"P.F","country":{"id":91}}EDIT: Added more info as requested.This ExclusionStrategy will do the thing, but you need to pass "Fully Qualified Field Name". See below:Here is how we can use it generically.It returns{"firstName":"Philip","middleName":"J.","initials":"P.F","lastName":"Fry","country":{"id":91}}After reading all available answers I found out, that most flexible, in my case, was to use custom @Exclude annotation. So, I implemented simple strategy for this (I didn\'t want to mark all fields using @Expose nor I wanted to use transient which conflicted with in app Serializable serialization) :Annotation:Strategy:Usage:I ran into this issue, in which I had a small number of fields I wanted to exclude only from serialization, so I developed a fairly simple solution that uses Gson\'s @Expose annotation with custom exclusion strategies.The only built-in way to use @Expose is by setting GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithoutExposeAnnotation(), but as the name indicates, fields without an explicit @Expose are ignored. As I only had a few fields I wanted to exclude, I found the prospect of adding the annotation to every field very cumbersome.I effectively wanted the inverse, in which everything was included unless I explicitly used @Expose to exclude it. I used the following exclusion strategies to accomplish this:Now I can easily exclude a few fields with @Expose(serialize = false) or @Expose(deserialize = false) annotations (note that the default value for both @Expose attributes is true). You can of course use @Expose(serialize = false, deserialize = false), but that is more concisely accomplished by declaring the field transient instead (which does still take effect with these custom exclusion strategies).You can explore the json tree with gson.Try something like this : You can add some properties also :Tested with gson 2.2.4.I came up with a class factory to support this functionality. Pass in any combination of either fields or classes you want to exclude.To use, create two lists (each is optional), and create your GSON object:Or can say whats fields not will expose with:on your class on attribute:I solved this problem with custom annotations.\nThis is my "SkipSerialisation" Annotation class: and this is my GsonBuilder:Example :Another approach (especially useful if you need to make a decision to exclude a field at runtime) is to register a TypeAdapter with your gson instance. Example below:In the case below, the server would expect one of two values but since they were both ints then gson would serialize them both. My goal was to omit any value that is zero (or less) from the json that is posted to the server.I used this strategy: \ni excluded every field which is not marked with @SerializedName annotation, i.e.:It returns{"VisibleValue":"I will see this"}I\'m working just by putting the @Expose annotation, here my version that I useIn Model class:In the Adapter class:
