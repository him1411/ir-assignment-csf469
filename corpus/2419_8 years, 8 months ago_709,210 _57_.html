I am attempting to set a value in a textarea field using jquery with the following code:The issue is, once this code executes, it is not altering the text in the textarea?However when performing an alert($("textarea#ExampleMessage").attr("value")) the newly set value is returned?Have you tried val?Textarea has no value attribute, its value comes between tags, i.e: <textarea>my text</textarea>, it is not like the input field (<input value="my text" />). That\'s why attr doesn\'t work :)$("textarea#ExampleMessage").val() in jquery just a magic. You should notice that textarea tag using inner html to display and not in value attribute just like input tag.You should useordepend on if you want to display it as html tags or plain text.I think this should work :Oohh come on boys! it works just with i had the same question so i decided to try it in the current browsers (we\'re one and a half year later in time after this question), and this (.val) worksforI had same issue and this solution didn\'t work but what worked was to use htmlThere the problem : I need to generate html code from the contain of a given div. Then, I have to put this raw html code in a textarea. When I use the function $(textarea).val() like this :$(textarea).val("some html like < input\n  type=\'text\' value=\'\' style="background: url(\'http://www.w.com/bg.gif\') repeat-x center;" /> bla bla");or$(\'#idTxtArGenHtml\').val(\n  $(\'idDivMain\').html() );I had problem with some special character ( & \' " ) when they are between quot. But when I use the function : \n $(textarea).html() the text is ok.There an example form : And javascript/jquery code that don\'t work to fill the textarea is : Finaly the solution : The trick is wrap your textarea with a span tag to help with the replaceWith function. \nI\'m not sure if it\'s very clean, but it\'s work perfect too add raw html code in a textarea.Text Area doesnot have value. jQuery .html() works in this casetextarea doesn\'t store values as     instead, it stores values in this format: So attr("value","someString") gets you this result: try $("#textareaid").val() or $("#textareaid").innerHTML instead.I tried with .val() .text() .html() and had some bugs using jQuery to read or set value of a textarea... i endup using native jsIt works for me....\nI have built a face book wall...Here is the basis of my code:We can either use .val() or .text() methods to set values. we need to put value inside val() like val("hello").Check example here: http://www.codegateway.com/2012/03/set-value-to-textarea-jquery.htmlTo set textarea value of encoded HTML (to show as HTML) you should use .html( the_var ) but as mentioned if you try and set it again it may (and probably) will not work.You can fix this by emptying the textarea .empty() and then setting it again with .html( the_var )Here\'s a working JSFiddle:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/w7b1thgw/2/On android .val and .html didn\'t work. $(\'#id\').text("some value") did the job.The accepted answer works for me, but only after I realized I had to execute my code after the page was finished loading.  In this situation inline script didn\'t work, I guess because #my_form wasn\'t done loading yet.You can even use the below snippet.When I had JQuery v1.4.4 in the page, neither of these worked.  When injecting JQuery v1.7.1 into my page, it worked finally.  So in my case, it was my JQuery version that was causing the issue.id ==> textareaid ======================Just use textarea Id by its type like it:Just use this code and you will always have the value:\nvar t = $(this);\nvar v = t.val() || t.html() || t.text(); \nSo it will check val() and set its value. If val() gets an empty string, NULL, NaN o.s. it will check for html() and then for text()...This works:Remember, the tricky part here is making sure you use the correct ID.\nAnd before you use the ID make sure you put # before it. Using $("textarea#ExampleMessage").html(\'whatever you want to put here\'); can be a good way, because .val() can have problems when you are using data from database.For example:A database field named as description has the following value asjkdfklasdjf sjkl\xc3\xb1adf. In this case using .val() to assign value to textarea can be a tedious job.I think there is missing one important aspect:works only when there is an ID selector (#)for class selector there is an option to use native value like:
