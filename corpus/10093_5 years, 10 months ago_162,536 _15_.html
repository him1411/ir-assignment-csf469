I am struggling to find the appropriate function that would return a specified number of rows picked up randomly without replacement from a data frame in R language? Can anyone help me out?First make some data:Then select some rows at random:The answer John Colby gives is the right answer.  However if you are a dplyr user there is also the answer sample_n:randomly samples 10 rows from the dataframe.  It calls sample.int, so really is the same answer with less typing (and simplifies use in the context of magrittr since the dataframe is the first argument).Write one! Wrapping JC\'s answer gives me:Now make it better by checking first if n<=nrow(df) and stopping with an error.The data.table package provides the function DT[sample(.N, M)], sampling M random rows from the data table DT.EDIT: This answer is now outdated, see the updated version.In my R package I have enhanced sample so that it now behaves as expected also for data frames:This is achieved by making sample an S3 generic method and providing the necessary (trivial) functionality in a function. A call to setMethod fixes everything. The original implementation still can be accessed through base::sample.In my R package there is a function sample.rows just for this purpose:Enhancing sample by making it a generic S3 function was a bad idea, according to comments by Joris Meys to a previous answer.Select a Random sample from a tibble type in R:nrow takes a tibble and returns the number of rows.  The first parameter passed to sample is a range from 1 to the end of your tibble.  The second parameter passed to sample, 150, is how many random samplings you want.  The square bracket slicing specifies the rows of the indices returned.  Variable \'a\' gets the value of the random sampling.
