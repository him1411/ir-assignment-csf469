I am trying to work with Spring Data and Neo4j. I started by trying to follow this guide linked to by the main site. In particular I based my pom.xml off of the "Hello, World!" example file. Here is a snip from my pom.xml for the plugin that is causing the issues...The error I am seeing is:I am running Eclipse 3.6.2 and m2e 0.13. I\'m not a Maven expert, so please be very explanatory in your answers if possible.I\'ve also tried m2e 1.0.0 via this update site and still get the same error.In my case of a similar problem, instead of using Andrew\'s suggestion for the fix, it worked simply after I introduced <pluginManagement> tag to the pom.xml in question.  Looks like that error is due to a missing <pluginManagement> tag.  So, in order to avoid the exceptions in Eclipse, looks like one needs to simply enclose all the plugin tags inside a <pluginManagement> tag, like so:Once this structure is in place, the error goes away.What a mess. I don\'t remember where I found this but I had to add the following to get M2Eclipse to be happy. Even more sad is that it isn\'t exactly easy to understand why this tag is needed.There were a number of other issues with the M2Eclipse plug-in that simply didn\'t work with Spring Data. In the end I disabled M2Eclipse in favor of the Apache Eclipse plug-in.Quickest way to solve this is\n(from Eclipse m2e documentation):use quick-fix on the error in pom.xml and select Permanently mark goal run in pom.xml as ignored in Eclipse build - this will generate the required boilerplate code for you.After that just replace the <ignore/> tag with <execute/> tag in the generated configuration and you\'re done:See https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/documentation/m2e-execution-not-covered.html .To solve some long-standing issues,\n  m2e 1.0 requires explicit instructions\n  what to do with all Maven plugins\n  bound to "interesting" phases of\n  project build lifecycle. We call these\n  instructions "project build lifecycle\n  mapping" or simply "lifecycle mapping"\n  because they define how m2e maps\n  information from project pom.xml file\n  to Eclipse workspace project\n  configuration and behaviour during\n  Eclipse workspace build.Project build lifecycle mapping\n  configuration can be specified in\n  project pom.xml, contributed by\n  Eclipse plugins and there is also\n  default configuration for some\n  commonly used Maven plugins shipped\n  with m2e. We call these "lifecycle\n  mapping metadata sources". m2e will\n  create error marker like below for all\n  plugin executions that do not have\n  lifecycle mapping in any of the\n  mapping metadata sources.m2e matches plugin\n  executions to actions using\n  combination of plugin groupId,\n  artifactId, version range and goal.\n  There are three basic actions that m2e\n  can be instructed to do with a plugin\n  execution -- ignore, execute and\n  delegate to a project configurator.In Eclipse Luna 4.4.0, you can chose to ignore this error in preferencesWindow > Preferences > Maven > Errors/Warnings > Plugin executiuon not covered by lifecycle configuration. Select Ignore / Warninig / Error as you wish. Also, In the quick fix (Ctrl + 1) for this error, it gives an option to \nMark goal  as ignored in Eclipse build in Eclipse preferences (experimental)This is a cleaner way, as it doesn\'t modify your pom.xml.You will need to do a Maven > Update project to fix the same error in any other project as well.m2e 0.13 introduce a m2e connectors and m2e Market Place to extend m2e features.\nIt\'s like the old m2e-extras repository.You can access the m2e market place from the preferences: Preferences>Maven>Discovery>Open Catalog.\nInstalling WTP integration solved most plugin issues for me.As an addendum to the previous answers -- there\'s a workaround I just discovered for if you can\'t or don\'t want to add all this boilerplate to your project POM. If you look in the following location:You should find a file called lifecycle-mapping-metadata.xml where you can make the same changes described in the other answers and in M2E plugin execution not covered.I had the same problem with Eclipse v3.7 (Indigo) and m2eclipse as my Maven plugin. The error was easily solved by explicitly stating the execution phase within the plugin definition.\nSo my pom looks like this:Note that the M2Eclipse (m2e) version 1.7.0 available in today\'s Eclipse Neon release train supports new syntax for specifying lifecycle mapping metadata. As a result boilerplate like this (here we\'re telling m2e to ignore the goal):can be replaced with a single line in the plugin\'s execution node:See the release notes for details. I\'ve had the same problem with indigo and a project that needs to generate Java sources from XSD. \nI could fix it by supplying the missing life cycle mapping, as described on this pageUse this software repositoryMake sure "Contact all update sites during install to find required software" is checked.Install the AJDT m2e ConfiguratorSource: Upgrading Maven integration for SpringSource Tool Suite 2.8.0 (Andrew Eisenberg)This should automatically install ADJT if you don\'t have it installed, but if it doesn\'t, install AspectJ Development Tools (ADJT) first from "Indigo update site" (according to your Eclipse version).More info on AspectJ Development Tools site. Change the Maven preferences for plugin execution from error to ignoreGoto workspace/rtc-ws/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.m2e.core/lifecycle-mapping-metadata.xml then create lifecycle-mapping-metadata.xml file and paste below and reload configuration as belowIf you are using Eclipse 4.2 and have troubles with mapping and won\'t put mess into yours pom.xml create new file lifecycle-mapping-metadata.xml configure it in Windows -> Preferences -> Lifecycle mapping  (don\'t forget press Reload workspace lifecycle mappings metadata after each change of this file!). Here is example based on eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.m2e.lifecyclemapping.defaults_1.2.0.20120903-1050.jar/lifecycle-mapping-metadata.xmlI fixed it following blog post Upgrading Maven integration for SpringSource Tool Suite 2.8.0.Follow the advice on the section called "Uh oh\xe2\x80\xa6my projects no longer build". Even when it\'s intended for SpringSource Tool Suite I used it to fix a regular Eclipse installation. I didn\'t have to modify my pom files.Use m2e 0.12, last version from Sonatype.I was using and changed it to and the error went away.  Maybe it\'s not recommended to bind an execution to the test-compile phase so finding a different phase might be an alternate solution to adding plugin-management configuration to the maven lifecycle.I had this problem today. I was using STS 3.4 with its bundled Roo 1.2.4. Later I tried with Eclipse Kepler and Roo 1.2.5, same error.I\'ve changed my pom.xml adding pluginTemplates tag after build and before plugins declaration but didn\'t work. What made the magic for me:Configured JDK, Roo and Maven bin directories on my PATH:export PATH=/opt/jdk1.7.0_51/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH=/opt/spring-roo-1.2.5.RELEASE/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH=/opt/apache-maven-3.2.1/bin:$PATHMade my configuration as following:\n(http://docs.spring.io/spring-roo/reference/html/beginning.html)Open with Eclipse (nothing of STS, but I guess it works): Import -> Existing Projects into WorkspaceWhere find WTP:Mouse down on < plugin > in pom.xml and \'Discover new m2e connectors\'.I installed them all what are default checked and it works.I had the exact same problem after updating m2e and solved it by reinstalling Maven Integration for Eclipse WTP.As it turns out, I uninstalled it trying to update m2e from version 0.x to 1.xInstead of messing up your pom file, I would suggest you to go to Show View \xe2\x86\x92 Markers in Eclipse, select and delete the markers of appropriate errors.If you are using Eclipse Juno, it could be the issue of Maven Integration For Eclipse WTP . So install the same from Eclipse Market Place.In Eclipse IDE \nHelp>>Eclipse Market Place >> type the query wtp and it will show maven integration for eclipse WTP for Juno, install it and update the maven dependencies and enjoyI encountered exact the same problem with maven thrift plugin. Here\'s my solution which requires no need to mess up your pom.xml:Use command line maven utility mvnmvn eclipse:eclipseto create a eclipse projectImport the project in eclipse. Remember to use File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspaceto add the project into your workspace.This should fix the problem. I got the same error. After doing the following it went away. This answer is just as good the top plugin-management answer above (which is to say, it\'s terrible).Just delete all the offending xml code in the pom.Done.  Problem solved (except you just broke your maven config...).Devs should be very careful they understand plugin-management tags before doing any of these solutions.\nJust slapping plugin-management around your plugins are random is likely to break the maven build for everyone else just to get eclipse to work.you can suppress this error in eclipse:\nWindow -> Preferences -> Maven -> Error/WarningsChangingintosolved the problem for me.I followed the GUI hint to finding any connector, and then I found AspectJ Integrator from SpringSource Team. After installation it was settled.I encountered this using Eclipse v4.3 (Kepler) and Maven 3.1.The solution is to use a JDK and not a JRE for your Eclipse project. Make sure to try maven clean and test from Eclipse just to download missing JAR files.This error happens also on neon because of missing m2e connector.\nSolution:\nhover error and select - Discover new m2e connectors.It will install new connector and that is it.For me this was caused by AspectJ classes. I could not find a plugin under Discovery that could help. So, I fixed this by copying the org.maven.ide.eclipse.ajdt files, under plugin and feature folders, of an existing STS installation. I know, very rude approach.
