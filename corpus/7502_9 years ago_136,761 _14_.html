Is there any way to know if I\'m compiling under Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 ?_MSC_VER and possibly _MSC_FULL_VER is what you need. You can also examine visualc.hpp in any recent boost install for some usage examples.Some values for the more recent versions of the compiler are:The version number above of course refers to the major version of your Visual studio you see in the about box, not to the year in the name.  A thorough list can be found here. Starting recently, Visual Studio will start updating it\'s ranges monotonically, meaning you should check ranges, rather than exact compiler values.cl.exe /? will give a hint of the used version, e.g.:Yep _MSC_VER is the macro that\'ll get you the compiler version.  The last number of releases of Visual C++ have been of the form <compiler-major-version>.00.<build-number>, where 00 is the minor number.  So _MSC_VER will evaluate to <major-version><minor-version>.You can use code like this:It appears updates between successive releases of the compiler, have not modified the compiler-minor-version, so the following code is not required:Access to more detailed versioning information (such as compiler build number) can be found using other builtin pre-processor variables here._MSC_VER should be defined to a specific version number.  You can either #ifdef on it, or you can use the actual define and do a runtime test.  (If for some reason you wanted to run different code based on what compiler it was compiled with?  Yeah, probably you were looking for the #ifdef. :))By using the _MSC_VER macro.As a more general answer http://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/Home/ maintains a list of macros for detecting specicic compilers, operating systems, architectures, standards and more.This is a little old but should get you started:In visual studio, go to help | about and look at the version of Visual Studio that you\'re using to compile your app.
