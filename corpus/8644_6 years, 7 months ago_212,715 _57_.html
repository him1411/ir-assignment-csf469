I want to add a custom right-click menu to my web application. Can this be done without using any pre-built libraries? If so, how to display a simple custom right-click menu which does not use a 3rd party JavaScript library?I\'m aiming for something like what Google Docs does. It lets users right-click and show the users their own menu.NOTE:\nI want to learn how to make my own versus using something somebody made already since most of the time, those 3rd party libraries are bloated with features whereas I only want features that I need so I want it to be completely hand-made by me.Answering your question - use contextmenu event, like below:But you should ask yourself, do you really want to overwrite default right-click behavior - it depends on application that you\'re developing.JSFIDDLEWas very useful for me. For the sake of people like me, expecting the drawing of menu, I put here the code I used to make the right-click menu:HTML: contextmenu.htmlCSS: contextmenu.cssJS: contextmenu.js - used from the accepted answerTested and works in Opera 11.6, firefox 9.01, Internet Explorer 9 and chrome 17\nYou can check out a working sample at javascript right click menuYou could try simply blocking the context menu by adding the following to your body tag:This will block all access to the context menu (not just from the right mouse button but from the keyboard as well). P.S. you can add this to any tag you want to disable the context menu onfor example:Will disable the context menu in that particular div onlyA combination of some nice CSS and some non-standard html tags with no external libraries can give a nice result (JSFiddle)HTMLNote: the menu tag does not exist, I\'m making it up (you can use anything)CSSThe JavaScript is just for this example, I personally remove it for persistent menus on windowsAlso note, you can potentially modify menu > menu{left:100%;} to menu > menu{right:100%;} for a menu that expands from right to left. You would need to add a margin or something somewhere thoughTry Thishttp://jsfiddle.net/AkshayBandivadekar/zakn7Lwb/14/According to the answers here and on other \'flows, I\'ve made a version that looks like the one of Google Chrome, with css3 transition. \nJS FiddleLets start eazy, since we have the js above on this page, we can worry about the css and layout. The layout that we will be using is an <a> element with a <img> element or a font awesome icon (<i class="fa fa-flag"></i>) and a <span> to show the keyboard shortcuts. So this is the structure:We will put these in a div and show that div on the right-click. Let\'s style them like in Google Chrome, shall we?Now we will add the code from the accepted answer, and get the X and Y value of the cursor. To do this, we will use e.clientX and e.clientY. We are using client, so the menu div has to be fixed.And that is it! Just add the css transisions to fade in and out, and done!\nI know this has already been answered, but I spent some time wrestling with the second answer to get the native context menu to disappear and have it show up where the user clicked.\nHTMLCSSJavaScriptCodePen ExampleYou can do it with this code.\nvisit here for full tutorial with automatic edge detection http://www.voidtricks.com/custom-right-click-context-menu/ `A simple way you could do it is use onContextMenu to return a JavaScript function:And by entering return false; you will cancel out the context menu.if you still want to display the context menu you can just remove the return false; line.Tested and works in Opera 12.17, firefox 30, Internet Explorer 9 and chrome 26.0.1410.64 Here is a very good tutorial on how to build a custom context menu with a full working code example (without JQuery and other libraries).You can also find their demo code on GitHub.They give a detailed step-by-step explanation that you can follow along to build your own right-click context menu (including html, css and javascript code) and summarize it at the end by giving the complete example code.You can follow along easily and adapt it to your own needs. And there is no need for JQuery or other libraries.This is how their example menu code looks like:A working example (task list) can be found on codepen.In the new html 5.1, there is a new Context Menus feature.Example HereYou should remember if you want to use the Firefox only solution, if you want to add it to the whole document you should add contextmenu="mymenu" to the <html> tag not to the body tag.\nYou should pay attention to this.You should probably use a third-party UI widget for that purpose. I recommend Shield UI\'s Context Menu, which is a flexible and easily-integrated component for JavaScript and HTML5.just today I found two more good examples (I think) about this:DEMO 1 //\nDEMO 2 (this demo need jquery UI)I hope help to anybody, bb.You can tweak and modify this code to make a better looking, more efficient contextmenu. As for modifying an existing contextmenu, I\'m not sure how to do that... Check out this fiddle for an organized point of view. Also, try clicking the items in my contextmenu. They should alert you a few awesome messages. If they don\'t work, try something more... complex.What I\'m doing up hereUser js to invoke your own actions.
