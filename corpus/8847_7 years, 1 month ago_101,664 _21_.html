When should I use a dictionary, list or set?Are there scenarios that are more suited for each data type?A list keeps order, dict and set don\'t: when you care about order, therefore, you must use list (if your choice of containers is limited to these three, of course;-).dict associates with each key a value, while list and set just contain values: very different use cases, obviously.set requires items to be hashable, list doesn\'t: if you have non-hashable items, therefore, you cannot use set and must instead use list.set forbids duplicates, list does not: also a crucial distinction.  (A "multiset", which maps duplicates into a different count for items present more than once, can be found in collections.Counter -- you could build one as a dict, if for some weird reason you couldn\'t import collections, or, in pre-2.7 Python as a collections.defaultdict(int), using the items as keys and the associated value as the count).Checking for membership of a value in a set (or dict, for keys) is blazingly fast (taking about a constant, short time), while in a list it takes time proportional to the list\'s length in the average and worst cases.  So, if you have hashable items, don\'t care either way about order or duplicates, and want speedy membership checking, set is better than list.Use a dictionary when you have a set of unique keys that map to values.Use a list if you have an ordered collection of items.Use a set to store an unordered set of items.When you want an unordered collection of unique elements, use a set. (For example, when you want the set of all the words used in a document).When you want to collect an immutable ordered list of elements, use a tuple. (For example, when you want a (name, phone_number) pair that you wish to use as an element in a set, you would need a tuple rather than a list since sets require elements be immutable).When you want to collect a mutable ordered list of elements, use a list. (For example, when you want to append new phone numbers to a list: [number1, number2, ...]).When you want a mapping from keys to values, use a dict. (For example, when you want a telephone book which maps names to phone numbers: {\'John Smith\' : \'555-1212\'}). Note the keys in a dict are unordered. (If you iterate through a dict (telephone book), the keys (names) may show up in any order).Although this doesn\'t cover sets, it is a good explanation of dicts and lists:Lists are what they seem - a list of values. Each one of them is\n  numbered, starting from zero - the first one is numbered zero, the\n  second 1, the third 2, etc. You can remove values from the list, and\n  add new values to the end. Example: Your many cats\' names.Dictionaries are similar to what their name suggests - a dictionary.\n  In a dictionary, you have an \'index\' of words, and for each of them a\n  definition. In python, the word is called a \'key\', and the definition\n  a \'value\'. The values in a dictionary aren\'t numbered - tare similar\n  to what their name suggests - a dictionary. In a dictionary, you have\n  an \'index\' of words, and for each of them a definition. The values in\n  a dictionary aren\'t numbered - they aren\'t in any specific order,\n  either - the key does the same thing. You can add, remove, and modify\n  the values in dictionaries.

Example: Your many cats\' names.Tuples are just like lists, but you can\'t change their values. The values that you give it first up, are the values that you are stuck with for the rest of the program. Again, each value is numbered starting from zero, for easy reference. Example: the names of the months of the year.Dictionaries are similar to what their name suggests - a dictionary. In a dictionary, you have an \'index\' of words, and for each of them a definition.
