In my table I set the width of the first cell in a column to be 100px.\nHowever, when the text in one of the cell in this column is too long, the width of the column becomes more than 100px. How could I disable this expansion?I played with it for a bit because I had trouble figuring it out.  You need to set the cell width (either th or td worked, I set both) AND set the table-layout to fixed. For some reason, the cell width seems to only stay fixed if the table width is set, too (i think that\'s silly but whatev).  Also useful is setting the overflow property to hidden.You should make sure to leave all of the bordering and sizing for CSS, too.Ok so here\'s what I have.  html:CSS:Here it is in JSFiddleThis guy had a similar problem: Table cell widths - fixing width, wrapping/truncating long wordsJust add <div> tag inside <td> or <th> define width inside <div>. \nThis will help you. Nothing else works.eg. See:\nhttp://www.html5-tutorials.org/tables/changing-column-width/After the table tag, use the col element. you don\'t need a closing tag.For example, if you had three columns:If you need one ore more fixed-width columns while other columns should resize, try setting both min-width and max-width to the same value.You need to write this inside the corresponding CSSWhat I do is:Set the td width: Set the td width with CSS: Set the width again as max and min with CSS: It sounds little bit repetitive but it gives me the desired result. To achieve this with much ease, you may need put the CSS values in a class in your style-sheet:then:Place the class attribute to any <td> you want.I used thisIt also helps, to put in the last "filler cell", with width:auto. This will occupy remaining space, and will leave all other dimensions as specified.  If you don\'t want a fixed layout, specify a class for the column to be size appropriately.CSS: HTML: KAsun has the right idea. Here is the correct code...Make the accepted answer respond for small screens when smaller than the fixed width.HTML:CSSJS Fiddlehttps://jsfiddle.net/w9s3ebzt/I found KAsun\'s answer works better using vw instead of px like so:<td><div style="width: 10vw" >...............</div></td>This was the only styling I needed to adjust the column widthYou don\'t need to set "fixed" - all you need is setting overflow:hidden since the column width is set.
