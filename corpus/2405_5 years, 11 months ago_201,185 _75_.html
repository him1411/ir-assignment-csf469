I\'ve been using Git for a while now, but the constant requests for a password are starting to drive me up the wall.I\'m using OSX and Github, and I set up Git and my SSH keys as instructed by GitHub\'s  Set Up Git page . I\'ve also added the github SSH key to my Mac OSX keychain, as mentioned on GitHub\'s SSH key passphrases page . My public key is registered with Git.Nevertheless, every time I try to git pull, I have to enter my username and password. Is there something other than an SSH key that I need to set up for this?I think you may have the wrong git repo url. Open .git/config and find the [remote "origin"] section. Make sure you\'re using the SSH one:And NOT the https or git one:You can now validate with just the SSH Key instead of the username and password. [Edit:] If Git complains that \'origin\' has already been added, open the .config file and edit the url = "..." part after [remote origin]On OS X (now macOS) run this in the TerminalIt enables git to use Keychain.app to store username and password and to retrieve the passphrase to your private ssh key from the keychain.For windows use: If the git credential helper is configured correctly macOS saves the passphrase in the keychain. Sometimes the connection between ssh and the passphrases stored in the keychain can break. Run ssh-add -K or ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa to add the key to keychain again.For macOS 10.12 Sierra ssh-add -K needs to be run after every reboot. To avoid this create ~/.ssh/config with this content.From the ssh_config man page on 10.12.2:UseKeychainOn macOS, specifies whether the system should search for passphrases in the user\'s keychain when attempting to use a particular key. When the passphrase is provided by the user, this option also specifies whether the passphrase should be stored into the keychain once it has been verified to be correct.  The argument must be \'yes\' or \'no\'.  The default is \'no\'.Apple has added Technote 2449 which explains what happened.Prior to macOS Sierra, ssh would present a dialog asking for your passphrase and would offer the option to store it into the keychain. This UI was deprecated some time ago and has been removed.This happened to me when I upgraded to macOS Sierra. Looks like the ssh agent got cleared upon upgrade.Simply running ssh-add located my existing identity, entered the password and good to go again.Use this:  Replace github.com with the appropriate hostnameAs others have said, you can install a password cache helper. I mostly just wanted to post the link for other platforms, and not just mac. I\'m running a linux server and this was helpful:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/#platform-linuxFor mac:Windows:Linux:Guide to git on windows and Github using SSH to push/pull\nhttp://nathanj.github.io/gitguide/tour.htmlIn windows for git 1.7.9+, run the following command in command prompt to open the configuration file in text editor:Then in the file add the following block if not present or edit it accordinglySave and close the file.\nYou will need to provide the crendentials only once after the above change.I figure you fixed your problem, but I don\'t see the solution here that helped me, so here it is.Type in terminal:That will empty your known_hosts file, and you\'ll have to add every host you used and have connected to, but it solved the problem.orkoden\'s answer on using the keychain with git in your terminal was incomplete and raises erros. This is what you have to do to save the username and password you enter in the the terminal in your keychain:Then enterIf you have already done the part with git config before the curl stuff, it\'s no problem, it\'ll workAs static_rtti said above, change to I myself changed the https in the .git/config file to ssh, but it still wasnt working. Then I saw that you MUST change the github.com to git@github.com. A good way to get the actual correct url is to go to your project page and click this Change HTTPS to SSH to get the right URLThen add this URL to the config file. Step1: check your current configYou will get: Step2: remove your remote originStep3: add remote origin back with your username and passwordI agree with "codehugger" and using the instruction of "orkoden" it worked for me - on netbeans 7.3 - when you right-click on the file and select context menu - push - a \'push to remote\' window opened - there are 2 options here origin:https://github.com/myaccount/myproject.git/https://github.com/myaccount/myproject.git/As you can see that the difference is the origin param in the url - you do not want to choose this option (1) you want to check option (2) and that works just fine for me. I hope this help someone.Dung Le.There are different kind of authentications depending on your configuration. Here are few:git credential-osxkeychain.If your credential is invalid, remove it by:or:So git won\'t ask you for the keychain permission again. Then configure it again.See: Updating credentials from the OSX Keychain at GitHubYour SSH RSA key.For this, you need to compare your SSH key with what you\'ve added, check by ssh-add -L/ssh-add -l if you\'re using the right identity.Your HTTPS authentication (if you\'re using https instead of ssh protocol).Use ~/.netrc (%HOME%/_netrc on Windows), to provide your credentials, e.g.Learn more: Syncing with GitHub at SOBefore you can use your key with github, follow this step in the tutorial Testing your SSH connection:having a typo in the URL will make git asking you for username and password, stupid gittested on Linux Kali, Git version 2.7.0try:git clone https://github.com/thisrepodoesntexists/doesntexists.gitNote: While this is convenient, Git will store your credentials in clear text in a local file (.git-credentials) under your project directory (see below for the "home" directory). If you don\'t like this, delete this file and switch to using the cache option.If you want Git to resume to asking you for credentials every time it needs to connect to the remote repository, you can run this command:To store the passwords in .git-credentials in your %HOME% directory as opposed to the project directory: use the --global flagLook for who is asking you for the passphrase. Is it git or your SSH agent?In my case, every time I did git pull it was asking me:Enter passphrase for key \'/work/username/.ssh/id_rsa\':So I assumed it was git asking for a passphrase. So I kept hunting for solutions, only to realize later that my SSH agent had shut down. Which can be fixed as given here.This was a pretty silly mistake I made, but posting it here, just in case it helps someone save some time from barking up the wrong tree, like I did.Use the following command to increase the timeout period so that you could retype password for a whileI used it for Bitbucket and Github it works for both. Only thing you need to do is \n3600 is in seconds, increase it to whatever extent you want.I changed it to 259200 Which is about 30days. This way I re-enter my password for every 30days or so.
