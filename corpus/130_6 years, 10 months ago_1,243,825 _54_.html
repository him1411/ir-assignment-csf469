I pulled a project from GitHub a few days ago. I\'ve since discovered that there are several forks on GitHub, and I neglected to note which one I took originally. How can I determine which of those forks I pulled?If referential integrity has been broken:If referential integrity is intact:When using git clone (from GitHub, or any source repository for that matter) the default name for the source of the clone is "origin". Using git remote show will display the information about this remote name. The first few lines should show:If you want to use the value in the script, you would use the first command listed in this answer.Should you want this for scripting purposes, you can get only the URL withYou can try:It will print all your remotes\' fetch/push URLs.To get the answer:This is better than reading the config; refer to the man page for git-ls-remote:--get-urlExpand the URL of the given remote repository taking into account\n  any "url.<base>.insteadOf" config setting (See git-config(1)) and\n  exit without talking to the remote.As pointed out by @Jefromi, this option was added in v1.7.5 and not documented until v1.7.12.2.With Git 2.7 (release January 5th, 2015), you have a more coherent solution using git remote:(nice pendant of git remote set-url origin <newurl>)See commit 96f78d3 (16 Sep 2015) by Ben Boeckel (mathstuf).\n(Merged by Junio C Hamano -- gitster -- in commit e437cbd, 05 Oct 2015):Expanding insteadOf is a part of ls-remote --url and there is no way\n  to expand pushInsteadOf as well.\n  Add a get-url subcommand to be able to query both as well as a way to get all configured URLs.Retrieves the URLs for a remote.\n  Configurations for insteadOf and pushInsteadOf are expanded here.\n  By default, only the first URL is listed.Before git 2.7, you had:To summarize, there are at least four ways:(The following was tried for the official Linux repository)Least information:andMore information:Even more information:Short answer:or, an alternative for pure quick scripts:Some info:I ended up with: $ git remote show -n origin, which  seems to be fastest. With -n it will not fetch remote heads (AKA branches). You don\'t need that type of info, right?http://www.kernel.org/pub//software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.htmlYou can apply | grep -i fetch to all three versions to show only the fetch URL.If you require pure speed, then use:Thanks to @Jefromi for pointing that out.I think you can find it under .git/config and remote["origin"] if you didn\'t manipulate that.For ssh:// repositories:For git:// repositories:Print arbitrarily named remote fetch URLs:To supplement the other answers:  If the remote has for some reason been changed and so doesn\'t reflect the original origin, the very first entry in the reflog (i.e. the last entry displayed by the command git reflog) should indicate where the repo was originally cloned from.e.g.(Bear in mind that the reflog may be purged, so this isn\'t guaranteed to work.)The upstream\'s remote may not be called "origin" so here\'s a variation:or:for more useful variables there\'s:simple way open .git/config filecat .git/configto edit vim .git/config ornano .git/configwith \ngit remote show origin\nyou have to be in the projects directory.\nBut if you want to determine the URLs from anywhere else\nyou could useIf you do not know the name of the upstream remote for a branch, you can look that up first by inspecting the upstream branch name that the current branch was built upon. Use git rev-parse like this:This shows that upstream branch that was the source for the current branch. This can be parsed to get the remote name like this:Now take that and pipe it to git ls-remote and you\'ll get the URL of the upstream remote that is the source of the current branch:Now it should be noted, that this is not necessarily the same as the source remote repository that was cloned from. In many cases however it will be enough.The git URL will be inside git config file. The value curespnds to the key url
