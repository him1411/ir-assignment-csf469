How do I get this directory out of conflict? I don\'t care if it\'s resolved using "theirs" or "mine" or whatever... Give the following command:(Thanks to @Jeremy Leipzig for this answer in a comment)Ok here\'s how to fix it:more details are at: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.tour.treeconflicts.htmlFor me only revert --depth infinity option fixed \nSvn\'s directory remains in confict problem:If you are using the Eclipse IDE and stumble upon this error when committing, here\'s an in-tool solution for you. I\'m using Subclipse, but the solution for Subversive could be similar.What you maybe didn\'t notice is that there is an additional symbol on the conflicting file, which marks the file indeed as "conflicted".Right-click on the file, choose "Team" and "Edit conflicts...". Choose the appropriate action. I merged the file manually on text-level before, so I took the first option, which will take the current state of your local copy as "resolved solution". Now hit "OK" and that\'s it.The conflicting symbol should have disappeared and you should be able to commit again...these three svn CLI commands in this sequence while cd-ed into the correct directory worked for me.One more solution below,If the entire folder is removed and svn is throwing the error "admin file .svn is missing", the following will ve used to resolve the conflict to working state.If you have trouble resolving (like me) and you cannot delete and update the resources because you have made many changes on them, plus you are using eclipse subversive instead of native client, follow these steps: You\'re done. I guess the propper solution is:I had similar issue, this is how it was solvedxyz@ip :~/formsProject_SVN$ svn resolved formsProj/templates/searchResolved conflicted state of \'formsProj/templates/search\'Now update your projectxyz@ip:~/formsProject_SVN$ svn updateUpdating \'.\':Select: (mc) keep affected local moves,\n        (r) mark resolved (breaks moves), (p) postpone,\n        (q) quit resolution, (h) help: r (select "r" option to resolve)Resolved conflicted state of \'formsProj/templates/search\'Summary of conflicts:\n  Tree conflicts: 0 remaining (and 1 already resolved)Instructions for Tortoise SVNNavigate to the directory where you see this error. \nIf you do not have any changes perform the followinga.
