I have a class that contains an enum property, and upon serializing the object using JavaScriptSerializer, my json result contains the integer value of the enumeration rather than its string "name".  Is there a way to get the enum as a string in my json without having to create a custom JavaScriptConverter?  Perhaps there\'s an attribute that I could decorate the enum definition, or object property, with?As an example:Desired json result:No there is no special attribute you can use. JavaScriptSerializer serializes enums to their numeric values and not their string representation. You would need to use custom serialization to serialize the enum as its name instead of numeric value.As mentioned by @Fabzter, there is an attribute.I have found that Json.NET provides the exact functionality I\'m looking for with a StringEnumConverter attribute:More details at available on StringEnumConverter documentation.Add the below to your global.asax for JSON serialization of c# enum as string@Iggy answer sets JSON serialization of c# enum as string only for ASP.NET (Web API and so).But to make it work also with ad hoc serialization, add following to your start class (like Global.asax Application_Start)More information on the Json.NET pageAdditionally, to have your enum member to serialize/deserialize to/from specific text, use the System.Runtime.Serialization.EnumMemberattribute, like this:This is easily done by adding a ScriptIgnore attribute to the Gender property, causing it to not be serialised, and adding a GenderString property which does get serialised:I wasn\'t able to change the source model like in the top answer (of @ob.), and I didn\'t want to register it globally like @Iggy.  So I combined https://stackoverflow.com/a/2870420/237091 and @Iggy\'s https://stackoverflow.com/a/18152942/237091 to allow setting up the string enum converter on during the SerializeObject command itself:This version of Stephen\'s answer doesn\'t change the name in the JSON:Here is the answer for newtonsoft.jsonHere is a simple solution that serializes a server-side C# enum to JSON and uses the result to populate a client-side <select> element. This works for both simple enums and bitflag enums.I have included the end-to-end solution because I think most people wanting to serialize a C# enum to JSON will also probably be using it to fill a <select> drop-down. Here goes:Example EnumA complex enum that uses bitwise ORs to generate a permissions system. So you can\'t rely on the simple index [0,1,2..] for the integer value of the enum.Server Side - C#The code above uses the NancyFX framework to handle the Get request. It uses Nancy\'s Response.AsJson() helper method - but don\'t worry, you can use any standard JSON formatter as the enum has already been projected into a simple anonymous type ready for serialization.Generated JSONClient Side - CoffeeScriptHTML BeforeHTML AfterYou can create JsonSerializerSettings with the call to JsonConverter.SerializeObject as below:You can also add a converter to your JsonSerializer if you don\'t want to use JsonConverter attribute:It will work for every enum it sees during that serialization.This is an old question but I thought I\'d contribute just in case. In my projects I use separate models for any Json requests. A model would typically have same name as domain object with "Json" prefix. Models are mapped using AutoMapper. By having the json model declare a string property that is an enum on domain class, AutoMapper will resolve to it\'s string presentation.In case you are wondering, I need separate models for Json serialized classes because inbuilt serializer comes up with circular references otherwise.Hope this helps someone.You can actually use a JavaScriptConverter to accomplish this with the built-in JavaScriptSerializer. By converting your enum to a Uri you can encode it as a string.I\'ve described how to do this for dates but it can be used for enums as well.http://blog.calyptus.eu/seb/2011/12/custom-datetime-json-serialization/Noticed that there is no answer for serialization when there is a Description attribute.Here is my implementation that supports the Description attribute.Enum: Usage:Just in case anybody finds the above insufficient, I ended up settling with this overload:For .Net Core Web Api :-The combination of Omer Bokhari and uri \'s answers is alsways my solution since the values that I want to provide is usually different from what I have in my enum specially that I would like to be able to change my enums if I need to.So if anyone is interested, it is something like this:I have put together all of the pieces of this solution using the Newtonsoft.Json library. It fixes the enum issue and also makes the error handling much better, and it works in IIS hosted services. It\'s quite a lot of code, so you can find it on GitHub here: https://github.com/jongrant/wcfjsonserializer/blob/master/NewtonsoftJsonFormatter.csYou have to add some entries to your Web.config to get it to work, you can see an example file here:\nhttps://github.com/jongrant/wcfjsonserializer/blob/master/Web.config
