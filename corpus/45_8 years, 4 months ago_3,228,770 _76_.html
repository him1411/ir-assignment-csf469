I need to check the checked property of a checkbox and perform an action based on the checked property using jQuery.For example, if the age checkbox is checked, then I need to show a textbox to enter age, else hide the textbox.But the following code returns false by default:How do I successfully query the checked property?How do I successfully query the checked property?The checked property of a checkbox DOM element will give you the checked state of the element.Given your existing code, you could therefore do this:However, there\'s a much prettier way to do this, using toggle:Use jQuery\'s is() function:Using jQuery > 1.6 Using the new property method:jQuery 1.6+jQuery 1.5 and belowAny version of jQueryAll credit goes to Xian.I am using this and this is working absolutely fine:Note: If the checkbox is checked it will return true otherwise undefined, so better check for the "TRUE" value.Since jQuery 1.6, the behavior of jQuery.attr() has changed and users are encouraged  not to use it to retrieve an element\'s checked state. Instead, you should use jQuery.prop():Two other possibilities are:If you are using an updated version of jquery, you must go for .prop method to resolve your issue:$(\'#isAgeSelected\').prop(\'checked\') will return true if checked and false if unchecked. I confirmed it and I came across this issue earlier. $(\'#isAgeSelected\').attr(\'checked\') and $(\'#isAgeSelected\').is(\'checked\') is returning undefined which is not a worthy answer for the situation. So do as given below.Hope it helps :)- Thanks.This worked for me:Where isAgeSelected is the id of the control.Also, @karim79\'s answer works fine. I am not sure what I missed at the time I tested it.Note, this is answer uses Microsoft Ajax, not jQueryUse:I decided to post an answer on how to do that exact same thing without jQuery. Just because I\'m a rebel.First you get both elements by their ID. Then you assign the checkboxe\'s onchange event a function that checks whether the checkbox got checked and sets the hidden property of the age text field appropriately. In that example using the ternary operator.Here is a fiddle for you to test it.AddendumIf cross-browser compatibility is an issue then I propose to set the CSS display property to none and inline.Slower but cross-browser compatible.Using the Click event handler for the checkbox property is unreliable, as the checked property can change during the execution of the event handler itself!Ideally, you\'d want to put your code into a change event handler such as it is fired every time the value of the check box is changed (independent of how it\'s done so).I believe you could do this:I ran in to the exact same issue. I have an ASP.NET checkboxIn the jQuery code I used the following selector to check if the checkbox was checked or not, and it seems to work like a charm.I\'m sure you can also use the ID instead of the CssClass,I hope this helps you.This returns true if the input is checked and false if it is not.My way of doing this is:This works for me:There are many ways to check if a checkbox is checked or not:Way to check using jQueryCheck example or also document:http://api.jquery.com/attr/http://api.jquery.com/prop/You can use this code:You can use:Both of them should work.Toggle: 0/1 or else1) If your HTML markup is:attr used:If prop is used:2) If your HTML markup is:attr used:Prop used:The top answer didn\'t do it for me. This did though:Basically when the element #li_13 is clicked, it checks if the element # agree (which is the checkbox) is checked by using the .attr(\'checked\') function. If it is then fadeIn the #saveForm element, and if not fadeOut the saveForm element.This is some different method to do the same thing:This example is for button.Try the following:Though you have proposed a JavaScript solution for your problem (displaying a textbox when a checkbox is checked), this problem could be solved just by css. With this approach, your form works for users who have disabled JavaScript.Assuming that you have the following HTML:You can use the following CSS to achieve the desired functionality:For other scenarios, you may think of appropriate CSS selectors.Here is a Fiddle to demonstrate this approach.Use this:The length is greater than zero if the checkbox is checked.orI think it will be the simple one I am using this:
