Possible Duplicate:\n  Getting attributes of Enum\xe2\x80\x99s value I have an enum with Description attributes like this:I found this bit of code for retrieving the description based on an EnumThis allows me to write code like:What I want to do is if I know the enum value (e.g. 1) - how can I retrieve the description? In other words, how can I convert an integer into an "Enum value" to pass to my GetDescription method?The default underlying data type for an enum in C# is an int, you can just cast it.I implemented this in a generic, type-safe way in Unconstrained Melody - you\'d use:This:I realise the core answer was just the cast from an int to MyEnum, but if you\'re doing a lot of enum work it\'s worth thinking about using Unconstrained Melody :)I put the code together from the accepted answer in a generic extension method, so it could be used for all kinds of objects:Using an enum like in the original post, or any other class whose property is decorated with the Description attribute, the code can be consumed like this:To make this easier to use, I wrote a generic extension:now I can write:Note: replace "Enumerations" above with your class nameYou can\'t easily do this in a generic way: you can only convert an integer to a specific type of enum.  As Nicholas has shown, this is a trivial cast if you only care about one kind of enum, but if you want to write a generic method that can handle different kinds of enums, things get a bit more complicated.  You want a method along the lines of:but this results in a compiler error that "int can\'t be converted to TEnum" (and if you work around this, that "TEnum can\'t be converted to Enum").  So you need to fool the compiler by inserting casts to object:You can now call this to get a description for whatever type of enum is at hand:
