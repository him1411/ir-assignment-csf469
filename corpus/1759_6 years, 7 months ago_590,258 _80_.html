So I added a folder to my .gitignore file.Once I do a git status it tells meHowever, when I try to change branches I get the following:This is what my .gitignore file looks like:How do I get this working so I can switch branches without deleting those files?If I make a change, will it affect those files? In other words, if I came back to this branch afterwards would everything be perfect as up to my latest commit?I don\'t want to lose those files, I just don\'t want them tracked.It seems like you want the files ignored but they have already been commited. .gitignore has no effect on files that are already in the repo so they need to be removed with git rm --cached. The --cached will prevent it from having any effect on your working copy and it will just mark as removed the next time you commit. After the files are removed from the repo then the .gitignore will prevent them from being added again.But you have another problem with your .gitignore, you are excessively using wildcards and its causing it to match less than you expect it to. Instead lets change the .gitignore and try this.WARNING: it will delete untracked files, so it\'s not a great answer to the question being posed. I hit this message as well. In my case, I didn\'t want to keep the files, so this worked for me:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-clean.html-x means ignored files are also removed as well as files unknown to git.-d means remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. -f is required to force it to run.Warning: This will delete the local files that are not indexedJust force it : git checkout -f another-branchIf you\'re on OS X, it may be because a file\'s name has had certain characters change case. Try setting the following config option:Git is telling you that it wants to create files (named public/system/images/9/... etc), but you already have existing files in that directory that aren\'t tracked by Git. Perhaps somebody else added those files to the Git repository, and this is the first time you have switched to that branch?There\'s probably a reason why those files in your develop branch but not in your current branch. You may have to ask your collaborators why that is.how do I get this working so I can switch branches without deleting those files?You can\'t do it without making the files disappear somehow. You could rename public to my_public or something for now.if I came back to this branch afterwards would everything be perfect as up to my latest commit?If you commit your changes, Git won\'t lose them. If you don\'t commit your changes, then Git will try really hard not to overwrite work that you have done. That\'s what Git is warning you about in the first instance here (when you tried to switch branches).There is a command for this delicate task (permanently deleting untracked files)Then git pull will do.Unfortunately neither git rm --cached or git clean  -d  -fx "" did it for me.My solution ended up being pushing my branch to remote, cloning a new repo, then doing my merge in the new repo. Other people accessing the repo had to do the same.Moral of the story: use a .gitignore file from inception.If you want to quickly resolve this question,You can use this command:This happened to me on a Windows 8 system, using Git from the command prompt.  The rest of my team uses TFS, and I use Microsoft\'s git-tf to push/pull between TFS and my local Git repository.The problem arose due to some files that had been renamed only to change their case.  What appears to have happened was this:The simplest solution for me was:I had the same problem when checking out to a branch based on an earlier commit. Git refused to checkout because of untracked files.I\'ve found a solution and I hope it will help you too.Adding the affected directories to .gitignore and issuing $ git rm -r --cached on them is apparently not enough. Assume you want to make a branch based an earlier commit K to test some stuff and come back to the current version. I would do it in the following steps:Setup the untracked files: \nedit the .gitignore and apply $ git rm -r --cached on the files and directories you want the git to ignore. Add also the file .gitignore itself to .gitignoreand don\'t forget to issue $ git rm -r --cached .gitignore. This will ensure the the ignore behavior of git leaves the same in the earlier commits.Commit the changes you just made:$ git add -A\n$ git commitSave the current log, otherwise you may get problems coming back to the current version$ git log > ../git.logHard reset to the commit K $ git reset --hard version_kCreate a branch based on the commit K$ git branch commit_k_branchCheckout into that branch$ git checkout commit_k_branch Do your stuff and commit itCheckout back into master again$ git checkout masterReset to the current Version again$ git reset current_version or $ git reset ORIG_HEADNow you can reset hard to the HEADgit reset --hard HEADNOTE!\nDo not skip the next-to-last step (like e. g. $ git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD\n) otherwise the untracked files git complained above will get lost.I also made sure the files git complained about were not deleted. I copied them to a text-file and issued the command $ for i in $(cat ../test.txt); do ls -ahl $i; doneIf you checkout to the branch mentioned above again, do not forget to issue $ git status to ensure no unwanted changes appear.In my case git rm --cached didn\'t work.\nBut i got it with a git rebaseThis could be a permission issue,change the ownership,I was also facing a similar issue and i tried all the solutions posted above but it didn\'t workThe issue was caused when i renamed my onMusicUpdateListener.java to OnMusicUpdateListener.java in develop branch. Now master had onMusicUpdateListener.java\nand develop had the same file as OnMusicUpdateListener.javaNow whenever i switched to master it gave me an errorand then it aborted.In order to solve this, i forcefully checked out master branch\nand then renamed my onMusicUpdateListener.java to OnMusicUpdateListener.java, committed it and then merged it with develop branch.Then i updated my develop branch by merging it into master and now everything is back to normal and problem is solved.These two functions(git rm --cached, \ngit checkout -f another-branch)  did NOT work for me.Instead, I physically removed the file (in eclipse) as what Git tells you to do; Please move or remove them before you can switch branches.and then I add/committed it.and then I pulled and it worked!In my case, I was seeing this error because I am using a popular open source CMS and the directory which was causing issues was the uploads directory which the CMS writes to.So what it was saying is that there are files which you don\'t have, but which you can\'t get from versioning.I\'m grabbing all the files from the live site to my local, then I\'ll check this into the repo in the hope that this fixes the issue.Delete .gitignore file from appname/gen/ to solve this issue.2 files with the same name but different case might be the issue.You can Delete one on these files or rename it. Ex:Move files, instead of deleteOne way of avoiding deleting files is to move them instead. For example:
