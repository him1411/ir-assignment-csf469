I\'m submitting a network request in a test case, but this sometimes takes longer than 2 seconds (the default timeout).How do I increase the timeout for a single test case?Here you go: http://mochajs.org/#test-levelFor arrow function use as follows:If you wish to use es6 arrow functions you can add a .timeout(ms) to the end of your it definition:At least this works in Typescript.(since I ran into this today)Be careful when using ES2015 fat arrow syntax:This will fail :EDIT: Why it fails:As @atoth mentions in the comments, fat arrow functions do not have their own this binding. Therefore, it\'s not possible for the it function to bind to this of the callback and provide a timeout function.Bottom line: Don\'t use arrow functions for functions that need an increased timeout.From command line:You might also think about taking a different approach, and replacing the call to the network resource with a stub or mock object. Using Sinon, you can decouple the app from the network service, focusing your development efforts.If you are using in NodeJS then you can set timeout in package.jsonthen you can run using npm like:Ok I use TypeScript and use async/await.\nHere is my problem:Took me while to realize that when you return Promise, mocha will wait the test properly.
