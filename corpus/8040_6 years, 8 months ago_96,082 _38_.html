How can the iPhone be set to vibrate once?For example, when a player loses a life or the game is over, the iPhone should vibrate.From "iPhone Tutorial: Better way to check capabilities of iOS devices":There are two seemingly similar functions that take a parameter kSystemSoundID_Vibrate:Both of the functions vibrate the iPhone. But, when you use the first\n  function on devices that don\xe2\x80\x99t support vibration, it plays a beep\n  sound. The second function, on the other hand, does nothing on\n  unsupported devices. So if you are going to vibrate the device\n  continuously, as an alert, common sense says, use function 2.First, add the AudioToolbox framework AudioToolbox.framework to your target in Build Phases.Then, import this header file:A simple way to do so is with Audio Services:Same as 2.0, no changes.AudioToolbox now presents the kSystemSoundID_Vibrate as a SystemSoundID type, so the code is:Instead of having to go thru the extra cast step(Props to @Dov)And, here\'s how you do it on Swift (in case you ran into the same trouble as I did)Link against AudioToolbox.framework (Go to your project, select your target, build phases, Link Binary with Libraries, add the library there)Once that is completed:The cheesy thing is that SystemSoundID is basically a typealias (fancy swift typedef) for a UInt32, and the kSystemSoundID_Vibrate is a regular Int. The compiler gives you an error for trying to cast from Int to UInt32, but the error reads as "Cannot convert to SystemSoundID", which is confusing. Why didn\'t apple just make it a Swift enum is beyond me.@aponomarenko\'s goes into the details, my answer is just for the Swifters out there.I had great trouble with this for devices that had vibration turned off in some manner, but we needed it to work regardless, because it is critical to our application functioning, and since it is just an integer to a documented method call, it will pass validation. So I have tried some sounds that were outside of the well documented ones here: TUNER88/iOSSystemSoundsLibraryI have then stumbled upon 1352, which is working regardless of the silent switch or the settings on the device (Settings->vibrate on ring, vibrate on silent).Important Note: Alert of Future Deprecation.As of iOS 9.0, the API functions description for:includes the following note:The right way to go will be using any of these two:or remember to import AVFoundationAnd if you\'re using Xamarin (monotouch) framework, simply callIn my travels I have found that if you try either of the following while you are recording audio, the device will not vibrate even if it is enabled.My method was called at a specific time in the measurement of the devices movements. I had to stop the recording and then restart it after the vibration had occurred.It looked like this.recorder is an AVRecorder instance.Hope this helps others that have had the same problem before.In Swift: In my case I was using the AVCaptureSession.\nAudioToolbox was in project\'s build phases and it was imported but still didn\'t work. In order to make it work I stopped the session before vibration and continued on after that. You can use 1) AudioServicesPlayAlertSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate);for iPhone and few newer iPods.2) AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate);for iPads.
