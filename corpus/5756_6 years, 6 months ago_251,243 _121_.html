Is there a way in which we can implement onBackPressed() in Android Fragment similar to the way in which we implement in Android Activity?As the Fragment lifecycle do not have onBackPressed(). Is there any other alternative method to over ride onBackPressed() in Android 3.0 fragments?I solved in this way override onBackPressed in the Activity. All the FragmentTransaction are addToBackStack before commit:According to @HaMMeRed answer here is pseudocode how should it works.\nLets say that your main activity is called BaseActivity which has child fragments (like in SlidingMenu lib example).\nHere are the steps:First we need create interface and class which implements its interface to have generic methodCreate class interface OnBackPressedListenerCreate class which implements skills of OnBackPressedListenerSince now, we will work on our code BaseActivity and its fragmentsCreate private listener on top of your class BaseActivitycreate method to set listener in BaseActivityin override onBackPressed implement something like thatin your fragment in onCreateView you should add our listenerVoila, now when you click back in fragment you should catch your custom on back method.If you wanted that sort of functionality you would need to override it in your activity, and then add a YourBackPressed interface to all your fragments, which you call on the relevant fragment whenever the back button is pressed.Edit: I\'d like to append my previous answer.If I were to do this today, I\'d use a broadcast, or possibly a ordered broadcast if I expected other panels to update in unison to the master/main content panel.LocalBroadcastManager in the Support Library can help with this, and you just send the broadcast in onBackPressed and subscribe in your fragments that care. I think that Messaging is a more decoupled implementation and would scale better, so it would be my official implementation recommendation now. Just use the Intent\'s action as a filter for your message. send your newly created ACTION_BACK_PRESSED, send it from your activity and listen for it in the relevant fragments.This worked for me: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27145007/3934111None of that is easy to implement nor will it function in an optimal way.Fragments have a method call onDetach that will do the job.THIS WILL DO THE JOB.Just add addToBackStack while you are transitioning between your fragments like below: if you write addToBackStack(null) , it will handle it by itself but if you give a tag , you should handle it manually. The solution is simple:1) If you have a base fragment class that all fragments extend, then add this code to it\'s class, otherwise create such a base fragment class2) In your Activity class, override onBackPressed as follows:3) In Your Fragment class, add your desired code:since this question and some of the answers are over five years old, let me share my solution. This is a follow-up and modernization to the answer from @oyenigunUPDATE:\nAt the bottom of this article, I added an alternative implementation using an abstract Fragment extension that won\'t involve the Activity at all, which would be useful for anyone with a more complex fragment hierarchy involving nested fragments that require different back behavior.I needed to implement this because some of the fragments I use have smaller views that I would like to dismiss with the back button, such as small information views that pop up, etc, but this is good for anyone who needs to override the behavior of the back button inside fragments.First, define an InterfaceThis interface, which I call Backable (I\'m a stickler for naming conventions), has a single method onBackPressed() that must return a boolean value. We need to enforce a boolean value because we will need to know if the back button press has "absorbed" the back event. Returning true means that it has, and no further action is needed, otherwise, false says that the default back action still must take place. This interface should be it\'s own file (preferably in a separate package named interfaces). Remember, separating your classes into packages is good practice.Second, find the top fragmentI created a method that returns the last Fragment object in the back stack. I use tags... if you use ID\'s, make the necessary changes. I have this static method in a utility class that deals with navigation states, etc... but of course, put it where it best suits you. For edification, I\'ve put mine in a class called NavUtils.Make sure the back stack count is greater than 0, otherwise an ArrayOutOfBoundsException could be thrown at runtime. If it isn\'t greater than 0, return null. We\'ll check for a null value later...Third, Implement in a FragmentImplement the Backable interface in whichever fragment where you need to override the back button behavior. Add the implementation method.In the onBackPressed() override, put whatever logic you need. If you want the back button to not pop the back stack (the default behavior), return true, that your back event has been absorbed. Otherwise, return false.Lastly, in your Activity...Override the onBackPressed() method and add this logic to it:We get the current fragment in the back stack, then we do a null check and determine if it implements our Backable interface. If it does, determine if the event was absorbed. If so, we\'re done with onBackPressed() and can return. Otherwise, treat it as a normal back press and call the super method.Second Option to not involve the ActivityAt times, you don\'t want the Activity to handle this at all, and you need to handle it directly within the fragment. But who says you can\'t have Fragments with a back press API? Just extend your fragment to a new class.Create an abstract class that extends Fragment and implements the View.OnKeyListner interface...As you can see, any fragment that extends BackableFragment will automatically capture back clicks using the View.OnKeyListener interface. Just call the abstract onBackButtonPressed() method from within the implemented onKey() method using the standard logic to discern a back button press. If you need to register key clicks other than the back button, just be sure to call the super method when overriding onKey() in your fragment, otherwise you\'ll override the behavior in the abstraction.Simple to use, just extend and implement:Since the onBackButtonPressed() method in the super class is abstract, once you extend you must implement onBackButtonPressed(). It returns void because it just needs to perform an action within the fragment class, and does not need to relay the absorption of the press back to the Activity. Make sure you do call the Activity onBackPressed() method if whatever you\'re doing with the back button doesn\'t require handling, otherwise, the back button will be disabled... and you don\'t want that!Caveats\nAs you can see, this sets the key listener to the root view of the fragment, and we\'ll need to focus it. If there are edit texts involved (or any other focus-stealing views) in your fragment that extends this class, (or other inner fragments or views that have the same), you\'ll need to handle that separately. There\'s a good article on extending an EditText to lose focus on a back press.I hope someone finds this useful. Happy coding.How about using onDestroyView()?Well I done it like this, and it work for meSimple interfaceFragmentOnBackClickInterface.javaExample implementation MyFragment.java then just override onBackPressed in activityIf you use EventBus,  it is probably a far more simpler solution :In your Fragment :and in your Activity class you can define :BackPressedMessage.java is just a POJO objectThis is super clean and there is no interface/implementation hassle.You should add interface to your project like below;And then, you should implement this interface on your fragment;And you can trigger this onBackPressed event under your activities onBackPressed event like below;This is just a small code that will do the trick:Hope it helps someone :)onBackPressed() cause Fragment to be detach from Activity.According to @Sterling Diaz answer I think he is right. BUT some situation will be wrong. (ex. Rotate Screen)So, I think we could detect whether isRemoving() to achieve goals.You can write it at onDetach() or onDestroyView(). It is work.  Do not implement ft.addToBackStack() method so that when you pressed back button your activity will be finished.Just follow these steps:Always while adding a fragment, Then in the main activity, override onBackPressed()To handle the back button in your app,That\'s it!Very short and sweet answer:Explanation of whole scenario of my case:I have FragmentA in MainActivity,\nI am opening FragmentB from FragmentA (FragmentB is child or nested fragment of FragmentA)Now if you want to go to FragmentA from FragmentB you can simply put getActivity().onBackPressed();  in FragmentB.Best solution, In activity life cycle, always android back button deals with FragmentManager transactions when we used FragmentActivity or AppCompatActivity. To handle the backstack we don\'t need to handle its backstack count or tag anything but we should keep focus while adding or replacing a fragment. Please find the following snippets to handle the back button cases,Here, I won\'t add back stack for my home fragment because it\'s home page of my application. If add addToBackStack to HomeFragment then app will wait to remove all the frament in acitivity then we\'ll get blank screen so I\'m keeping the following condition,Now, you can see the previously added fragment on acitvity and app will exit when reaching HomeFragment. you can also look on the following snippets.Its just simple if you have An Activity A and you make 3 fragments like B ,C and D.Now if you are in fragment B or C and onBackPressed you want to move on Fragment D every time .Then you have to just Override the onBackPressed() method in main Activity A and also when you jump to any fragment then pass a TAG or name  of that fragment by which you recognized that fragment in main Activity A.I am giving the example of that one by which you can easily understand that.... or if you are moving from fragment B to fragment C..and on back press you want to come on Fragment D...like belowNow you have to just override the onBackPressed() method in main activity....like below..I have used another approach as follows:The full approach with sample code is included here as an answer to this other SO question.I know it\'s too late but I had the same problem last week. None of the answers helped me. I then was playing around with the code and this worked, since I already added the fragments.In your Activity, set an OnPageChangeListener for the ViewPager so that you will know when the user is in the second activity. If he is in the second activity, make a boolean true as follows:Now check for the boolean whenever back button is pressed and set the current item to your first Fragment:this is my solution:in MyActivity.java:and in Fragment:public class MyActivity extends Activity {}in your fragment add the following, dont forget to implement mainactivity\'s interface.on mainActivityon fragment implement base activity/fragment likeDraweHomeActivity is my base activity writeand create method doBackHere is my solution for that issue:in Activity A:in Activity B:activity b holds the fragment.in fragment:in that way the Intent Object "data" in activity A will get the string from the fragmentI had the same problem and I created a new listener for it and used in my fragments.1 - Your activity should have a listener interface and a list of listeners in it2 - You should implement methods for adding and removing the listeners3 - You should override the onBackPressed method to check that any of the listeners use the back press or not4 - Your fragment must implement the interface for back press5 - You need to add the fragment as a listener for back press6 - You should return true from onBackPressed if the fragment uses this back press7 - IMPORTANT - You must remove the fragment from the list onDestroyThere is a Stack used instead of the ArrayList to be able to start from the latest fragment. There may be a problem also while adding fragments to the back stack. So you need to check that the fragment is visible or not while using back press. Otherwise one of the fragments will use the event and latest fragment will not be closed on back press.I hope this solves the problem for everyone.I just use findFragmentById and cast to the fragment and call a method that handles onBackpressed.  This sample shows checking if this is the first step in order process if it is pop up a dialog fragment to confirm exit order. Just use
