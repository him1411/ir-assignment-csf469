I\'m trying to get Windows Task Scheduler to run a particular .exe every 10 minutes or so, but the options only allow for once a day execution.Is there a way I can get it to run a .exe every 10 or 20 minutes?The task must be configured in two steps.First you create a simple task that start at 0:00, every day. Then, you go in Advanced... (or similar depending on the operating system you are on) and select the Repeat every X minutes option for 24 hours.The key here is to find the advanced properties. If you are using the XP wizard, it will only offer you to launch the advanced dialog once you created the task.On more recent versions of Windows (7+ I think?):After you select the minimum repeat option (5 minutes or 10 minutes) you can highlight the number and write whatever number you want You can also create a batch file like the following if you need finer granularity between calls:On XP, I clicked the Advanced button on the Schedule tab. There is a checkbox for Repeat task. The default is every 10 minutes.Additionally, you can create scheduled task via the command line. I haven\'t tried this myself, but it looks like you\'d want something along the lines of (not tested):In the "Repeat Task every:" just type 2 minutes instead of choosing from the dropdown list. To schedule the update to be automatic you should:Some of the links provided are only settings for Windows 2003\'s version of "Scheduled Tasks"In Windows Server 2008 the "Tasks" setup only has a  box with options for "5 Minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 mins, and 1 hour" (screen shot: http://i46.tinypic.com/2gwx7r8.jpg)...  where the Window 2003 was a "enter whatever number you want" textbox.I thought doing an "Export" and editing the XML from:\n    PT30M\nto\n    PT2Mand importing that as a new task would "trick" Tasks into repeating every 2 mins, but it didn\'t like thatMy workaround for getting a task to run every 2 mins in Windows 2008 was to (ugggh) setup 30 different "triggers" for my task repeating every hour but staring at :00, :02, :04, :06 and so on and so on....    took me 8-10 mins to setup but I only had to do it once  :-)While taking the advice above with schtasks, you can see in the UI what must be done to perform an hourly task.  When you edit trigger begin the task on a schedule, One Time (this is the key).  Then you can select "Repeat task every:" 1 hour or whatever you wish.  See screenshot:
