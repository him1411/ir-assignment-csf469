I have a bunch of .keystore files and need to find one with specific CN and alias. Is there a way to do it with keytool, jarsigner or some other tool? I found a way to check if specific keystore was used to sign a specific apk, but I also need to get the alias and certificate name in each of the files.You can run the following command to list the content of your keystore file:If you are looking for a specific alias, you can also specify it in the command:If the alias is not found, it will display an exception:keytool error: java.lang.Exception: Alias  does not existIn order to get all the details I had to add the -v option to romaintaz answer:You can run from Java code.Certificate class holds all information about the keystore.UPDATE- OBTAIN PRIVATE KEY@prateek Hope this is what you looking for!KeyStore Explorer  open source visual tool to manage keystores.In a bash-like environment you can use:This command consist of 3 parts.

And finally in the 3rd part you can search for a specific alias (or part of it). The -i turns the case insensitive mode on. Thus the given command will yield all aliases containing the pattern \'foo\', f.e. foo, 123_FOO, fooBar, etc. For more information man grep.This will list all certificates:
