What I have is an object that has an IsReadOnly property. If this property is true, I would like to set the IsEnabled property on a Button, ( for example ), to false.I would like to believe that I can do it as easily as IsEnabled="{Binding Path=!IsReadOnly}" but that doesn\'t fly with WPF.Am I relegated to having to go through all of the style settings? Just seems too wordy for something as simple as setting one bool to the inverse of another bool.You can use a ValueConverter that inverts a bool property for you.XAML:Converter:Have you considered a IsNotReadOnly property? If the object being bound is a ViewModel in a MVVM domain then the additional property makes perfect sense. If it\'s a direct Entity model, you might consider composition and presenting a specialized viewmodel of your entity to the form.With standart binding you need to use converters that looks little windy. So, I recommend you to look at my project CalcBinding, which was developed specially to resolve this problem and some others. With advanced binding you can write expressions with many source properties directly in xaml. Say, you can write something like:orororwhere A, B, C, IsChecked - properties of viewModel and it will work properlyGoodluck!I would recommend using https://quickconverter.codeplex.com/Inverting a boolean is then as simple as:\n<Button IsEnabled="{qc:Binding \'!$P\', P={Binding IsReadOnly}}" />That speeds the time normally needed to write converters.I wanted my XAML to remain as elegant as possible so I created a class to wrap the bool which resides in one of my shared libraries, the implicit operators allow the class to be used as a bool in code-behind seamlesslyThe only changes needed to your project are to make the property you want to invert return this instead of boolAnd in the XAML postfix the binding with either Value or InvertThis one also works for nullable bools.     Don\'t know if this is relevant to XAML, but in my simple Windows app I created the binding manually and added a Format event handler.Add one more property in your view model, which will return reverse value.\nAnd bind that to button.\nLike;in view model:in xaml:
