How do you create a static class in C++? I should be able to do something like:Assuming I created the BitParser class. What would the BitParser class definition look like?If you\'re looking for a way of applying the "static" keyword to a class, like you can in C# for example, then you won\'t be able to without using Managed C++.But the looks of your sample, you just need to create a public static method on your BitParser object. Like so:BitParser.hBitParser.cppYou can use this code to call the method in the same way as your example code.Hope that helps! Cheers.Consider Matt Price\'s solution.What you want is, expressed in C++ semantics, to put your function (for it is a function) in a namespace.There is no "static class" in C++. The nearest concept would be a class with only static methods. For example:But you must remember that "static classes" are hacks in the Java-like kind of languages (e.g. C#) that are unable to have non-member functions, so they have instead to move them inside classes as static methods.In C++, what you really want is a non-member function that you\'ll declare in a namespace:In C++, the namespace is more powerful than classes for the "Java static method" pattern, because:Conclusion: Do not copy/paste that Java/C#\'s pattern in C++. In Java/C#, the pattern is mandatory. But in C++, it is bad style.There was an argument in favor to the static method because sometimes, one needs to use a static private member variable.I disagree somewhat, as show below:First, myGlobal is called myGlobal because it is still a global private variable. A look at the CPP source will clarify that:At first sight, the fact the free function barC can\'t access Foo::myGlobal seems a good thing from an encapsulation viewpoint... It\'s cool because someone looking at the HPP won\'t be able (unless resorting to sabotage) to access Foo::myGlobal.But if you look at it closely, you\'ll find that it is a colossal mistake: Not only your private variable must still be declared in the HPP (and so, visible to all the world, despite being private), but you must declare in the same HPP all (as in ALL) functions that will be authorized to access it !!!So using a private static member is like walking outside in the nude with the list of your lovers tattooed on your skin : No one is authorized to touch, but everyone is able to peek at. And the bonus: Everyone can have the names of those authorized to play with your privies.private indeed...\n:-DAnonymous namespaces will have the advantage of making things private really private.First, the HPP headerJust to be sure you remarked: There is no useless declaration of barB nor myGlobal. Which means that no one reading the header knows what\'s hidden behind barA.Then, the CPP:As you can see, like the so-called "static class" declaration, fooA and fooB are still able to access myGlobal. But no one else can. And no one else outside this CPP knows fooB and myGlobal even exist!Unlike the "static class" walking on the nude with her address book tattooed on her skin the "anonymous" namespace is fully clothed, which seems quite better encapsulated AFAIK.Unless the users of your code are saboteurs (I\'ll let you, as an exercise, find how one can access to the private part of a public class using a dirty behaviour-undefined hack...), what\'s private is private, even if it is visible in the private section of a class declared in a header.Still, if you need to add another "private function" with access to the private member, you still must declare it to all the world by modifying the header, which is a paradox as far as I am concerned: If I change the implementation of my code (the CPP part), then the interface (the HPP part) should NOT change. Quoting Leonidas : "This is ENCAPSULATION!"When are classes static methods are actually better than namespaces with non-member functions?When you need to group together functions and feed that group to a template:Because, if a class can be a template parameter, a namespaces cannot.You can also create a free function in a namespace:In BitParser.hIn BitParser.cppIn general this would be the preferred way to write the code. When there\'s no need for an object don\'t use a class.If you\'re looking for a way of applying the "static" keyword to a class, like you can in C# for examplestatic classes are just the compiler hand-holding you and stopping you from writing any instance methods/variables.If you just write a normal class without any instance methods/variables, it\'s the same thing, and this is what you\'d do in C++In C++ you want to create a static function of a class (not a static class).You should then be able to call the function using BitParser::getBitAt() without instantiating an object which I presume is the desired result.Can I write something like static class?No, according to the C++11 N3337 standard draft Annex C 7.1.1:Change: In C ++, the static or extern specifiers can only be applied to names of objects or functions.\n  Using these specifiers with type declarations is illegal in C ++. In C, these specifiers are ignored when used\n  on type declarations. Example:Rationale: Storage class specifiers don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meaning when associated with a type. In C ++, class\n  members can be declared with the static storage class specifier. Allowing storage class specifiers on type\n  declarations could render the code confusing for users.And like struct, class is also a type declaration.The same can be deduced by walking the syntax tree in Annex A.It is interesting to note that static struct was legal in C, but had no effect: Why and when to use static structures in C programming?You \'can\' have a static class in C++, as mentioned before, a static class is one that does not have any objects of it instantiated it.  In C++, this can be obtained by declaring the constructor/destructor as private.  End result is the same.In Managed C++, static class syntax is:-... better late than never...This is similar to C#\'s way of doing it in C++In C# file.cs you can have private var inside a public function.\nWhen in another file you can use it by calling the namespace with the function as in:Here\'s how to imp the same in C++:SharedModule.hSharedModule.cppOtherFile.hOtherFile.cppUnlike other managed programming language, "static class" has NO meaning in C++. You can make use of static member function.
