I already know that apply and call are similar functions which setthis (context of a function).The difference is with the way we send the arguments (manual vs array)Question:But when should I use the  bind() method ?jsbinUse .bind() when you want that function to later be called with a certain context, useful in events. Use .call() or .apply() when you want to invoke the function immediately, and modify the context.Call/apply call the function immediately, whereas bind returns a function that, when later executed, will have the correct context set for calling the original function. This way you can maintain context in async callbacks and events.I do this a lot:I use it extensively in Node.js for async callbacks that I want to pass a member method for, but still want the context to be the instance that started the async action.A simple, naive implementation of bind would be like:There is more to it (like passing other args), but you can read more about it and see the real implementation on the MDN.Hope this helps.They all attach this into function (or object) and the difference is in the function invocation (see below).call attaches this into function and executes the function immediately:bind attaches this into function and it needs to be invoked separately like this:or like this:apply is similar to call except that it takes an array-like object instead of listing the arguments out one at a time:It allows to set the value for this independent of how the function is called. This is very useful when working with callbacks:To achieve the same result with call would look like this:Assume we have multiplication functionLets create some standard functions using bindvar multiby2 = multiplication.bind(this,2);Now multiby2(b) is equal to multiplication(2,b);What if I pass both the parameters in bindNow getSixAlways() is equal to multiplication(3,2);even passing parameter returns 6;\n   getSixAlways(12); //6 This create a new multiplication function and assigns it to magicMultiplication.Oh no, we are hiding the multiplication functionality into magicMultiplication.calling\nmagicMultiplication returns a blank function b()on execution it works fine\nmagicMultiplication(6,5); //30How about call and apply?magicMultiplication.call(this,3,2); //6magicMultiplication.apply(this,[5,2]); //10In simple words, bind creates the function, call and apply executes the function whereas apply expects the parameters in arrayBoth Function.prototype.call() and Function.prototype.apply() call a function with a given this value, and return the return value of that function.Function.prototype.bind(), on the other hand, creates a new function with a given this value, and returns that function without executing it.So, let\'s take a function that looks like this :Now, let\'s take an object that looks like this :We can bind our function to our object like this :Now, we can run Obj.log anywhere in our code :Where it really gets interesting, is when you not only bind a value for this, but also for for its argument prop :We can now do this :Here is one good article to illustrate the difference among bind(), apply() and call(), summarize it as below.bind() allows us to easily set which specific object will be bound to this when a function or method is invoked.bind() allow us to borrow methodsOne problem with this example is that we are adding a new method showData on the cars object and \nwe might not want to do that just to borrow a method because the cars object might already have a property or method name showData.\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to overwrite it accidentally. As we will see in our discussion of Apply and Call below, \nit is best to borrow a method using either the Apply or Call method.bind() allow us to curry a functionFunction Currying, also known as partial function application, is the use of a\nfunction (that accept one or more arguments) that returns a new function with some of the arguments already set. We can use bind() to curry this greet functionapply() or call() to set this valueThe apply, call, and bind methods are all used to set the this value when invoking a method, and they do it in slightly\ndifferent ways to allow use direct control and versatility in our JavaScript code. The apply and call methods are almost identical when setting the this value except that you pass the function parameters to apply () as an array, while you have to list the parameters individually to pass them to the call () method. Here is one example to use call or apply to set this in the callback function.Borrow functions with apply or callBorrow Array methodsLet\xe2\x80\x99s create an array-like object and borrow some array methods to operate on the our array-like object.Another common case is that convert arguments to array as followingBorrow other methodsUse apply() to execute variable-arity functionThe Math.max is one example of variable-arity function,But what if we have an array of numbers to pass to Math.max? We cannot do this:This is where the apply () method helps us execute variadic functions. Instead of the above, we have to pass the array of numbers using apply () thus:call/apply executes function immediately:bind doesn\'t execute function immediately, but returns wrapped apply function (for later execution):Call apply and bind. and how they are different.Lets learn call and apply using any daily terminology. You have three automobiles your_scooter , your_car and your_jet which start with the same mechanism (method). \nWe created an object automobile with a method push_button_engineStart. Lets understand when is call and apply used. Lets suppose that you are an engineer and you have your_scooter, your_car and your_jet which did not come with a push_button_engine_start and you wish to use a third party push_button_engineStart.If you run the following lines of code, they will give an error. WHY?So the above example is successfully gives your_scooter, your_car, your_jet a feature from automobile object.Let\'s dive deeper\nHere we will split the above line of code. \nautomobile.push_button_engineStart is helping us to get the method being used. Further we use apply or call using the dot notation. \nautomobile.push_button_engineStart.apply()Now apply and call accept two parameters. So here we set the context in the final line of code. automobile.push_button_engineStart.apply(your_scooter,[20])Difference between call and apply is just that apply accepts parameters in the form of an array while call simply can accept a comma separated list of arguments. what is JS Bind function?A bind function is basically which binds the context of something and then stores it into a variable for execution at a later stage. Let\'s make our previous example even better. Earlier we used a method belonging to the automobile object and used it to equip your_car, your_jet and your_scooter. Now lets imagine we want to give a separate push_button_engineStart separately to start our automobiles individually at any later stage of the execution we wish. still not satisfied?Let\'s make it clear as teardrop. Time to experiment. We will go back to call and apply function application and try storing the value of the function as a reference. The experiment below fails because call and apply are invoked immediately, hence, we never get to the stage of storing a reference in a variable which is where bind function steals the showvar test_function = automobile.push_button_engineStart.apply(your_scooter);Imagine, bind is not available. \nyou can easily construct it as follow : I think the same places of them are: all of them can change the this value of a function.The differences of them are: the bind function will return a new function as a result; the call and apply methods will execute the function immediately, but apply can accept a array as params,and it will parse the array separated.And also, the bind function can be Currying.bind function should be use when we want to assign a function with particular context for eg.in above example if we call demo.setValue() function and pass this.getValue function directly then it doesn\'t call demo.setValue function directly because this in setTimeout refers to window object so  we need to pass demo object context to this.getValue function using bind. it means we only passing function with the context of demo object not actully calling function.Hope u understand . for more information please refer \njavascript bind function know in detail
