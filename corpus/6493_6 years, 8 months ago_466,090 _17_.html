I can use this:Is there a way to remove all occurrences of character X from a String in Java?I tried this and is not what I want: str.replace(\'X\',\' \'); //replace with spaceTry using the overload that takes CharSequence arguments (eg, String) rather than char:Usingwill work. Usage would be str.replace("X", "");.Executing returns:If you want to do something with Java Strings, Commons Lang StringUtils is a great place to look.This is the example for where I have removed the character - from the String.I like using RegEx in this occasion:where g means global so it will go through your whole string and replace all X with \'\';\nif you want to replace both X and x, you simply say:(see my fiddle here: fiddle)Hello Try this code belowYou can use str = str.replace("X", ""); as mentioned before and you will be fine. For your information \'\' is not an empty (or a valid) character but \'\\0\' is. So you could use str = str.replace(\'X\', \'\\0\'); instead.
