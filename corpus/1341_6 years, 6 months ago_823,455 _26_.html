I\'d like to know if it\'s possible from windows command line to list ALL environment variables.Something equivalent to powershell gci env: (or ls env: or dir env:).Just doYou can also do SET prefix to see all variables with names starting with prefix.for example if you want to read only derbydb from the environment variables do the following : and you will get the following : Jon has the right answer, but to elaborate a little more with some syntactic sugar.. enables you to see the variables one page at a time, rather than the whole lot, orsends the output to a file output.txt which you can open in notepad or whatever...Simply run set from cmd.Displays, sets, or removes environment variables. Used without parameters, set displays the current environment settings.To list all Environment variables in Powershell:source: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff730964.aspxI would say that SET command doesn\'t really print all environmental variables. \nFor instance we can echo such variables as CD, DATE, TIME but they are not listed in SET output.It would be interesting to get really whole list of variables that can be used for batch writing for example.You can use SET in cmdTo show the current variable, just SET is enoughTo show certain variable such as \'PATH\', use SET PATH.For help, type set /?.If you want to see the environment variable you just set, you need to open a new command window.\n"Variables set with setx variables are available in future command windows only, not in the current command window." (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755104(v=ws.11).aspx#BKMK_examples)don\'t lose time to search it in registryreg query "HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environment"returns less then set commandAs mentioned in other threads you can use set to list all the environment variables or useset [environment_varible] to get specific variable with value.set [environment_varible]= can be use to remove variable from space.
