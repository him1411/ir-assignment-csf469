Visual Studio is such a massively big product that even after years of working with it I sometimes stumble upon a new/better way to do things or things I didn\'t even know were possible.For instance-Crtl + R, Ctrl + W to show white spaces. Essential for editing Python build scripts.Under "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\8.0\\Text Editor" \nCreate a String called Guides with the value "RGB(255,0,0), 80" to have a red line at column 80 in the text editor.What other hidden features have you stumbled upon?Make a selection with ALT pressed - selects a square of text instead of whole lines.Tracepoints!  Put a breakpoint on a line of code. Bring up the Breakpoints Window and right click on the new breakpoint. Select \'When Hit...\'. By ticking the \'Print a message\' check box Visual Studio will print out a message to the Debug Output every time the line of code is executed, rather than (or as well as) breaking on it. You can also get it to execute a macro as it passes the line.You can drag code to the ToolBox. Try it!Click an identifier (class name, variable, etc) then hit F12 for "Go To Definition". I\'m always amazed how many people I watch code use the slower right-click -> "Go To Definition" method.EDIT: Then you can use Ctrl+- to jump back to where you were.CTRL+SHIFT+V will cycle through your clipboard, Visual Studio keeps a history of copies.Sara Ford covers lots of lovely tips: http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/archive/tags/Visual+Studio+2008+Tip+of+the+Day/default.aspxBut some of my favourites are Code Snippets, Ctrl + . to add a using <Namespace> or generate a method stub.\nI can\'t live without that.Check out a great list in the Visual Studio 2008 C# Keybinding poster: http://www.microsoft.com/downloadS/details.aspx?familyid=E5F902A8-5BB5-4CC6-907E-472809749973&displaylang=enReformat Document!\nThis is under the VB keybindings, not sure about C#How many times do you debug an array in a quickwatch or a watch window and only have visual studio show you the first element?  Add ",N" to the end of the definition to make studio show you the next N items as well.  IE "this->m_myArray" becomes "this->m_array,5".Incremental search: While having a source document open hit (CTRL + I) and type the word you are searching for you can hit (CTRL + I) again to see words matching your input.You can use the following codes in the watch window.Can\'t live without it! :)Stopping the debugger from stepping into trivial functions.  When you\xe2\x80\x99re stepping through code in the debugger, you can spend a lot of time stepping in and out of functions you\xe2\x80\x99re not particularly interested in, with names such as GetID(), or std::vector<>(), to pick a C++ example. You can use the registry to make the debugger ignore these.  For Visual Studio 2005, you have to go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio \\8.0\\NativeDE\\StepOver and add string values containing regular expressions for each function or set of functions you wish to exclude; e.g. std::vector.*::.*\nTextBox::GetIDYou can also override these for individual exceptions. For instance, suppose you did want to step into the vector class\xe2\x80\x99s destructor:std::vector.*::\\~.*=StepIntoYou can find details for other versions of Visual Studio at http://blogs.msdn.com/andypennell/archive/2004/02/06/69004.aspxCtrl-F10:     run to cursor during debugging. Took me ages to find this, and I use it all the time;Ctrl-E, Ctrl-D:     apply standard formatting (which you can define).TAB key feature.If you know snippet key name, write and click double Tab. for example:\nWriteforeachand then click tab key twice to2. If you write any event, write hereand then click tab key twice tobtn_Click function write automaticallyMouseLeftButtonDown then click tab\nMouseLeftButtonDown="" then click tab again\nMouseLeftButtonDown="Button_MouseLeftButtonDown" in the code section Button_MouseLeftButtonDown method created. Sara Ford has this market cornered.http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/default.aspxMore Visual Studio tips and tricks than you can shake a stick at.Some others:T4 (Text Template Transformation Toolkit). T4 is a code generator built right into Visual StudioCustom IntelliSense dropdown height, for example displaying 50 items instead of the default which is IMO ridiculously small (8).(To do that, just resize the dropdown next time you see it, and Visual Studio will remember the size you selected next time it opens a dropdown.)Discovered today:Brings up the context menu for refactoring (then one that\'s accessible via the underlined  last letter of a class/method/property you\'ve just renamed - mouse over for menu or "Ctrl" + ".")A lot of people don\'t know or use the debugger to it\'s fullest - I.E. just use it to stop code, but right click on the red circle and there are a lot more options such as break on condition, run code on break.Also you can change variable values at runtime using the debugger which is a great feature - saves rerunning code to fix a silly logic error etc.Line transpose, Shift-Alt-T\nSwaps two line (current and next) and moves cursor to the next line. I\'m lovin it. I\'ve even written a macro which changed again position by one line, executed line transpose and changed line position again so it all looking like I swapping current line with previous (Reverse line transpose).Word transpose, Shift-Ctrl-T  When developing C++, Ctrl-F7 compiles the current file only.Document Outline in the FormsDesigner (CTRL + ALT + T)Fast control renaming, ordering and more!To auto-sync current file with Solution Explorer. So don\'t have to look where the file lives in the project structureTools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> "Track Active Item in Solution Explorer"Edit: If this gets too annoying for you then you can use Dan Vanderboom\'s macro to invoke this feature on demand through a keystroke.(Note: Taken from the comment below by Jerry).I\'m not sure if it\'s "hidden", but not many people know about it -- pseudoregisters. Comes very handy when debugging, I\'ve @ERR, hr in my watch window all the time.Ctrl-Minus, Ctrl-Plus, navigates back and forward where you\'ve been recently (only open files, though).I don\'t use it often, but I do love:To select in a rectangular block, to \'block\' boundaries.As noted in comments,Does just a plain rectangular block.Here\'s something I learned (for C#):You can move the cursor to the opening curly brace from the closing curly brace by pressing Control + ].I learned this on an SO topic that\'s a dupe of this one:\xe2\x80\x9cHidden Secrets\xe2\x80\x9d of the Visual Studio .NET debugger? CTRL + Shift + U -> Uppercase highlighted section.\nCTRL + U -> Lowercase the highlighted section\nGreat for getting my SQL Statements looking just right when putting them into string queries.Also useful for code you\'ve found online where EVERYTHING IS IN CAPS.Middle Mouse Button Click on the editor tab closes the tab.To display any chunk of data as an n-byte "array", use the following syntax in Visual Studio\'s QuickWatch window:For example, to view a variable named foo as a 256-byte array, enter the following expression in the QuickWatch window:This is particularly useful when viewing strings that aren\'t null-terminated or data that\'s only accessible via a pointer.  You can use Visual Studio\'s Memory window to achieve a similar result, but using the QuickWatch window is often more convenient for a quick check.
