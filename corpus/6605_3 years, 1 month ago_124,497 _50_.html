I have an application which works fine on Xcode6-Beta1 and Xcode6-Beta2 with both iOS7 and iOS8. But with Xcode6-Beta3, Beta4, Beta5 I\'m facing network issues with iOS8 but everything works fine on iOS7. I get the error "The network connection was lost.". The error is as follows:Error: Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1005 "The network connection was lost." UserInfo=0x7ba8e5b0 {NSErrorFailingURLStringKey=, _kCFStreamErrorCodeKey=57, NSErrorFailingURLKey=, NSLocalizedDescription=The network connection was lost., _kCFStreamErrorDomainKey=1, NSUnderlyingError=0x7a6957e0 "The network connection was lost."}I use AFNetworking 2.x and the following code snippet to make the network call:I tried NSURLSession but still receive the same error.Restarting the simulator fixed the issue for me.We had this exact error and it turned out to be an issue with the underlying HTTP implementation of NSURLRequest:As far as we can tell, when iOS 8 receive an HTTP response with a Keep-Alive header, it keeps this connection to re-use later (as it should), but it keeps it for more than the timeout parameter of the Keep-Alive header and then when a second request comes it tries to re-use a connection that has been dropped by the server.Here are the solutions we have found so far:For mine, Resetting content and settings of Simulator works.\nTo reset the simulator follow the steps:iOS Simulator -> Reset Content and Settings -> Press Reset (on the\n  warning which will come)The iOS 8.0 simulator runtime has a bug whereby if your network configuration changes while the simulated device is booted, higher level APIs (eg: CFNetwork) in the simulated runtime will think that it has lost network connectivity.  Currently, the advised workaround is to simply reboot the simulated device when your network configuration changes.If you are impacted by this issue, please file additional duplicate radars at http://bugreport.apple.com to get it increased priority.If you see this issue without having changed network configurations, then that is not a known bug, and you should definitely file a radar, indicating that the issue is not the known network-configuration-changed bug.what solved the problem for me was to restart simulator ,and reset content and settings.Also have a problem with beta 5 and AFNetworking 1.3 when running on iOS8 simulator that results in a connection error "Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1005 "The network connection was lost."". The same code works fine on iOS7 and 7.1 simulators and my debugging proxy shows that the failure occurs before a connection is actually attempted (i.e. no requests logged). I have tracked the failure to NSURLConnection and reported bug to Apple. See attached line 5 in attached image.. \nChanging to use https allows connection from iOS8 simulators albeit with intermittent errors.\nProblem is still present in Xcode 6.01 (gm).Opening Charles resolved the issue for me, which seems very strange...See pjebs comment on Jan 5 on Github. Method1 :Also some suggests to re-connect to the site, i.e. Firing the POST request TWICESolution: Use a method to do connection to the site, return (id), if the network connection was lost, return to use the same method.Method 2I was experiencing this problem while using Alamofire.  My mistake was that I was sending an empty dictionary [:] for the parameters on a GET request, rather than sending nil parameters.Hope this helps!I have this issue also, running on an iOS 8 device.\nIt is detailed some more here and seems to be a case of iOS trying to use connections that have already timed out.\nMy issue isn\'t the same as the Keep-Alive problem explained in that link, however it seems to be the same end result.I have corrected my problem by running a recursive block whenever I receive an error -1005 and this makes the connection eventually get through even though sometimes the recursion can loop for 100+ times before the connection works, however it only adds a mere second onto run times and I bet that is just the time it takes the debugger to print the NSLog\'s for me.Here\'s how I run a recursive block with AFNetworking:\nAdd this code to your connection class fileThen use it likes this:You\'ll see that I use a AFHTTPRequestOperation subclass but add your own request code. The important part is calling recurse(@offset.intValue+1)); to make the block be called again.If anyone is getting this error while uploading files to a backend server, make sure the receiving server has a maximum content size that is allowable for your media.  In my case, NGINX required a higher client_max_body_size.  NGINX would reject the request before the uploading was done so no error code came back.I was getting this error as well, but on actual devices rather than the simulator. We noticed the error when accessing our heroku backend on HTTPS (gunicorn server), and doing POSTS with large bodys (anything over 64Kb). We use HTTP Basic Auth for authentication, and noticed the error was resolved by NOT using the didReceiveChallenge: delegate method on NSURLSession, but rather baking in the Authentication into the original request header via adding Authentiation: Basic <Base64Encoded UserName:Password>. This prevents the necessary 401 to trigger the didReceiveChallenge: delegate message, and the subsequent network connection lost.I was hitting this error when passing an NSURLRequest to an NSURLSession without setting the request\'s HTTPMethod.Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1005 "The network connection was lost."Add the HTTPMethod, though, and the connection works fineI had same problem. Solution was simple, I\'ve set HTTPBody, but haven\'t set HTTPMethod to POST. After fixing this, everything was fine.I had to exit XCode, delete DerivedData folder contents (~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData or /Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData) and exit simulator to make this work.I was getting the error even on ios7 device when I was using xcode 6.2 beta.\nswitching back from xcode 6.2 beta to 6.1.1 fixed the issue. at least on ios7 device.If the problem is occurring on a device, check if traffic is going through a proxy (Settings > Wi-Fi > (info) > HTTP Proxy). I had my device setup to use with Charles, but forgot about the proxy. Seems that without Charles actually running this error occurs.I was connecting via a VPN. Disabling the VPN solved the problem.Test if you can request from other apps (like safari). If not might be something on your computer. In my case I had this problem with Avast Antivirus, which was blocking my simulators request (don\'t ask me why).Got the issue for months, and finally discovered that when we disable DNSSEC on our api domain, everything was ok :simple_smile:I was having this issue for the following reason. TLDR: Check if you are sending a GET request that should be sending the parameters on the url instead of on the NSURLRequest\'s HTTBody property.==================================================I had mounted a network abstraction on my app, and it was working pretty well for all my requests.I added a new request to another web service (not my own) and it started throwing me this error. I went to a playground and started from the ground up building a barebones request, and it worked. So I started moving closer to my abstraction until I found the cause.My abstraction implementation had a bug: \nI was sending a request that was supposed to send parameters encoded in the url and I was also filling the NSURLRequest\'s HTTBody property with the query parameters as well.\nAs soon as I removed the HTTPBody it worked.I was receiving this error and also notices that the application Postman was also falling but was working in app Advanced Rest Client (ARC) and working in Android.\nSo i had to install Charles to debug the communication and I notices that response code was -1.\nThe problem was that REST programmer forgot to return response code 200.I hope that this help other developers.
