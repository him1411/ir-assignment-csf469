I can\'t find anywhere it has been documented this. By default, the find() operation will get the records from beginning. How can I get the last N records in mongodb?Edit: also I want the returned result ordered from less recent to most recent, not the reverse.If I understand your question, you need to sort in ascending order.Assuming you have some id or date field called "x" you would do ...The 1 will sort ascending (oldest to newest) and -1 will sort descending (newest to oldest.)If you use the auto created _id field it has a date embedded in it ... so you can use that to order by ...That will return back all your documents sorted from oldest to newest.You can also use a Natural Order mentioned above ...Again, using 1 or -1 depending on the order you want.Lastly, it\'s good practice to add a limit when doing this sort of wide open query so you could do either ...orThe last N added records, from less recent to most recent, can be seen with this query:If you want them in the reverse order:If you install Mongo-Hacker you can also use:If you get tired of writing these commands all the time you can create custom functions in your ~/.mongorc.js. E.g.then from a mongo shell just type last(N)In order to get last N records you can execute below query:if you want only one last record:Note: In place of $natural you can use one of the columns from your collection.you can use sort() , limit() ,skip() to get last N record start from any skipped  value You can\'t "skip" based on the size of the collection, because it will not take the query conditions into account.The correct solution is to sort from the desired end-point, limit the size of the result set, then adjust the order of the results if necessary. Here is an example, based on real-world code.Look under Querying: Sorting and Natural Order, http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sorting+and+Natural+Order\nas well as sort() under Cursor Methods\nhttp://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+QueriesLast function should be sort, not limit.Example:
