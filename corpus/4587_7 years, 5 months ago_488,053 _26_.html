Is there a way to install cURL in Windows in order to run cURL commands from the command prompt?If you are not into Cygwin, you can use native Windows builds. Some are here: curl Download Wizard.First you need to download the cURL executable. For Windows 64bit, download it from here and for Windows 32bit download from here \nAfter that, save the curl.exe file on your C: drive.To use it, just open the command prompt and type in:If you have Git installed on windows you can use the GNU Bash.... it\'s built in.https://superuser.com/questions/134685/run-curl-commands-from-windows-console/#483964Folks that don\'t literally need the curl executable, but rather just need to e.g. see or save the results of a GET request now and again, can use powershell directly. From a normal command prompt, type:which, while a bit wordy, is similar to typingin a more Unix-ish environment.More information about net.webclient is available here: WebClient Methods (System.Net).UPDATE: I like how ImranHafeez took this one step further in this answer. I\'d prefer a simpler cmd-script however, maybe creating a curl.cmd file containing this:which could be called just like the Unix-ish example above:If you use the Chocolatey package manager, you can install cURL by running this command from the command line or from PowerShell:You can get Git Bash which would work the same as in Linux. Install Gitbash and get it running where ever you want by right clicking and launching the Git bash.it should work perfectly fine if you would download it from \n--http://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin&os=Win64&flav=MinGW64   -- FOR 64BIT Win7/XP OR from http://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin&os=Win32&flav=-&ver=2000%2FXP  --- FOR 32BIT Win7/XP just extract the files to c:/Windows and run it from cmd I was able to use this site  to easily download and install curl on my Windows machine. It took all of 30 seconds. I\'m using Windows 7 (w/ Admin privelages), so I downloaded curl-7.37.0-win64.msi from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html. Also, don\'t forget to restart your console/terminal after you install curl, otherwise you will get the same error messages. Create batch file in windows and enjoy with cURL in windows :)Assuming you are new to the game or are unable to install software because of security restrictions, you could use Scoop to install curl. From a powershell or command window run the following commands. Note this assumes that you have Powershell v3.0+.  The other cool advantage here is that this installs the software for just the current user.Set execution exceptionInstall ScoopInstall curl. You may see a warning about a missing hash, but you should see a final message that cURL was installed successfullyTest the install of curlI have also found that if I put the cygwin bin on my windows path I can run curl from a windows command line. It also will give you access to things like ls and grepp.s. If you want another folder to store executable check your paths > echo %PATH%
