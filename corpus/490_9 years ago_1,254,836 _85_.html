How can you find out which process is listening on a port on Windows?(add -n to stop it trying to resolve hostnames, which will make it a lot faster)Note Dane\'s recommendation for TCPView. Looks very useful!-a  Displays all connections and listening ports.-b  Displays the executable involved in creating each connection or\n        listening port. In some cases well-known executables host\n        multiple independent components, and in these cases the\n        sequence of components involved in creating the connection\n        or listening port is displayed. In this case the executable\n        name is in [] at the bottom, on top is the component it called,\n        and so forth until TCP/IP was reached. Note that this option\n        can be time-consuming and will fail unless you have sufficient\n        permissions.-n  Displays addresses and port numbers in numerical form.-o  Displays the owning process ID associated with each connection.There\'s a native GUI for Windows:or Run resmon.exe, \nor from TaskManager performance tabUse TCPView if you want a GUI for this.  It\'s the old Sysinternals app that Microsoft bought out.You can get more information if you run the following command:using the \'Find\' command allows you to filter the results.  find /i "listening" will display only ports that are \'Listening\'.  Note, you need the /i to ignore Case otherwise you would type find "LISTENING".  |find "port" will limit the results to only those containing the specific port number.  Note, on this it will also filter in results that have the port number anywhere in the response string.  Open a command prompt window (as Administrator) From "Start\\Search box" Enter "cmd" then right-click on "cmd.exe" and select "Run as Administrator"Enter the following text then hit Enter.-a          Displays all connections and listening ports.-b          Displays the executable involved in creating each connection or\n            listening port. In some cases well-known executables host\n            multiple independent components, and in these cases the\n            sequence of components involved in creating the connection\n            or listening port is displayed. In this case the executable\n            name is in [] at the bottom, on top is the component it called,\n            and so forth until TCP/IP was reached. Note that this option\n            can be time-consuming and will fail unless you have sufficient\n            permissions.-n          Displays addresses and port numbers in numerical form.-o          Displays the owning process ID associated with each connection.Find the Port that you are listening on under "Local Address"Look at the process name directly under that.NOTE: To find the process under Task ManagerNote the PID (process identifier) next to the port you are looking at.Open Windows Task Manager. Select the Processes tab. Look for the PID you noted when you did the netstat in step 1.If you don\xe2\x80\x99t see a PID column, click on View / Select Columns. Select PID.Make sure \xe2\x80\x9cShow processes from all users\xe2\x80\x9d is selected.Use only one command:where 9000 should be replaced by your port number.The output will contain something like this:Explanation:it iterates through every line from the output of the following command: from every line, the PID (%a - the name is not important here) is extracted (PID is the 5th element in that line) and passed to the following commandIf you want to skip the header and the return of the command prompt, you can use:Output:First we find process id of that particular task which we need to eliminate in order to get port freetype\nnetstat -n -a -oAfter executing this command in windows command line prompt(cmd)\nselect the pid which i think the last column suppose this is 3312Now typetaskkill /F /PID 3312You can now cross check by typing netstat command.NOTE: sometimes windows doesn`t allow you to run this command directly on CMD so first you need to go with this steps\nfrom start-> command prompt (right click on command prompt, and run as administrator)It is very simple to get the port number from pid in windows.The following are the steps:1) Go to run --> type cmd --> press enter.2) write the following command...(Note: Don\'t include square brackets.)3) press enter...4) Then cmd will give you the detail of the service running on that port alongwith pid.5) Open task manager and hit the service tab and match the pid with that of the cmd and that\'s it.To get a list of all the owning process ID associated with each connection:If want to kill any process have the id and use this command, so that port become freeIf you\'d like to use a GUI tool to do this there\'s SysInternals TCPView.netstat -ao and netstat -ab tell you the application, but if you\'re not admin you\'ll get "The requested operation requires elevation".It\'s not ideal, but if you use sysinternals Process Explorer you can go to specific processes\' properties and look at the TCP tab to see if they\'re using the port you\'re interested in.  Bit of a needle and haystack thing, but maybe it\'ll help someone....Type in the command: netstat -aon | findstr :DESIRED_PORT_NUMBERFor example, if I want to find port 80: netstat -aon | findstr :80This answer was originally posted in this thread.netstat -a -o \nThis shows the PID of the process running on a particular port.Keep in mind the process id and go to Task manager and services or details tab and end the process which has the same PID. Thus you can kill a process running on a particular port in windows.Just open a command shell and type : (saying your port is 123456)You will see everything you needThe headers are :this is as mentioned hereFollow these tools :- From cmd :- C:\\> netstat -anob with Administrator privilege.http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653 - Process Explorerhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645 - Process Dumphttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896644 - Port MonitorAll from sysinternals.comIf you just want to know process running and threads under each process, I recommend to learn about wmic. Wonderful cmd line tool, which gives you much more than you can know.Exampe :-Above command will show all process list in brief every 5 seconds. To know more, you can just go with /? command of windows , for E.g, and so on and so forth. :)I recommend CurrPorts from NirSoft.CurrPorts can filter the displayed results. TCPView doesn\'t have this feature.Note: You can right click a process\'s socket connection and select "Close Selected TCP Connections" (You can also do this in TCPView). This often fixes connectivity issues I have with Outlook and Lync after I switch VPNs. With CurrPorts, you can also close connections from the command line.With PowerShell 5 on Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016, run Get-NetTCPConnection cmdlet. I guess that it should also work on older Windows versions.The default output of Get-NetTCPConnection does not include Process ID by some reason and it is a bit confusing. However, you could always get it by formatting the output. The property you are looking for is OwningProcess.If you want to find out the ID of the process that is listening on port 443, run this command:Format the output to a table with the properties you look for:If you want to find out a name of the process, run this command:For those using Powershell, try Get-NetworkStatistics: For Windows, if you want to find stuff listening or connected to port 1234, execute the following at the cmd prompt:
