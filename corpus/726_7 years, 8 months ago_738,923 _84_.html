C# desktop application on express edition. Worked then didn\'t work 5 seconds later.I tried the following.I have two WinForms projects in the solution. One of them loads the debug info, one doesn\'t. They both refer to the assembly I\'m trying to get debug info on in exactly the same way in the project file. Any ideas?I want to add in here, mostly for myself when I come back to review this question, that symbols are not loaded until the assembly is loaded, and the assembly is not loaded until it is needed. If the breakpoint is in a library that is only used in one function in your main assembly, the symbols will not be loaded (and it will show the breakpoint as not being hit) until that function is called.Start debugging, as soon as you\'ve arrived at a breakpoint or used Debug > Break All, use Debug > Windows > Modules.  You\'ll see a list of all the assemblies that are loaded into the process.  Locate the one you want to get debug info for.  Right-click it and select Symbol Load Information.  You\'ll get a dialog that lists all the directories where it looked for the .pdb file for the assembly.  Verify that list against the actual .pdb location.  Make sure it doesn\'t find an old one.In normal projects, the assembly and its .pdb file should always have been copied by the IDE into the same folder as your .exe.  The bin\\Debug folder of your project.  Make sure you remove one from the GAC if you\'ve been playing with it.Just something simple to try - you may have tried it already. \nRight click the Solution in solution explorer, click "clean solution", this deletes all the compiled and temporary files associated with a solution.Do a rebuild of the solution and try to debug again.I\'ve also had troubles with breakpoints multiple projects in a solution - some compiled as x86, some as x64. Is this your setup?First try rebuilding your project by right mouse click the project > Rebuild\nIf that doesn\'t work, try a clean of the project (right mouse click on the project > clean)If that didn\'t work check this:(step 6 generates the .pdb files, these are the debugging symbols)Disable the "Just My Code" option in the Debug/General settings.Cross posting this fix from Hans K that I found on the similar thread >> HERE <<:Right click on solution --> PropertiesLook under Common Properties --> Startup ProjectSelect multiple startup projectsselect Start action on the projects you need to debug.Thanks to Hans!The selected answer led me to fix my problem. But I need to do a few things more:Even with "Debug" selected in the dropdown:And in the project Properties > Build:The Visual Studio was not loading symbols to a specific project. So in that dropdown I select "Configuration Manager" and saw that the settings to my web project was incorrect:Then I set that to "Debug" and it starts to generate the .PDB file. \nBUT I need to manually copy the PDB and DLL and put in the folder that VS was looking (here is where the selected answer helped me):Debug > Windows > Modules to see what modules were being loaded put me in the right direction.In my case IIS Express seemed to be loading a different DLL from the temporary ASP.NET files.The solution?I was able to fix the error by simply setting the option in the \'Attach to Process\' to \'Automatically determine the type of code to debug\' option as shown in the attached screenshot.Simply follow the steps below:Sometimes, even though it gives you this error, the breakpoint still gets hit, so just ignore the error. This happens fairly often in the Views of an MVC web app.Try running visual studio as an administrator within windows.In my case "Optimize Code" was checked in my project properties.  This caused VS to see my assembly as "not my code", and in turn, it did not load symbols for it.The solution was to uncheck this.\nI noticed that the .pdb file didn\'t generate in bin folder of the project. I went to properties on the project, selected "Build" and then "Advanced". In the new dialog that popped up did I choose "full" under on the "Debug info" property, and this solved it for me.We found the cause of our problem. This code was using the "CodeBehind" attribute in the Page directive of the .aspx file instead of the "CodeFile" attribute (ASP.NET 2.0 and beyond). After days of desperation, a simple search and replace solved the problem.Just Check whether your solution is in Release Mode. You need to enable "Generate debug info" in compiler settingsI tried everything mentioned above, but nothing worked.\n[Clean solution, and check for PDB files etc.]Even publishing the same solution did not resolve the issue.Then I went to back to what I usually do to resolve (fool this stubborn Visual Studio)All I did was to make a deliberate change in code and publish the solution.\nThen I reverted the change and published again.Voila [PDB files rid of evil spirits].. Not a smart resolution, but this did work.. :-|Option  "Start debugging, Debug + Windows + Modules" does not exist in Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 edition.Unchecking "Use Managed Compatibility Mode" in Tools Options Debugging fixes this.Things to check just to be clear: Make sure you have the configuration set to \'Debug\' and not \'Release\'. You can debug the startup project in \'Release\' mode, but not a referenced class library.Instead of doing all these things just the solution it will fix the issueNone of those answers solved my problem. I tried another thing based on fact that the project with the stop wasn\'t in reality the loaded project. I found as Hans Passant wrote that the .dll where I want to stop debugger and the associoated .pdb files where copied near the .exe file. Those files have had an older date so I thought they wasn\'t updated in the runtime. I manually deleted them, Visual Studio create another pair AND put this new pair near the .exe. Now the breakpoins works !Maybe Visual Studio cannot copy and REPLACE existing files (.dll and .pdb) near the .exe since there are another there. So if I deleted manually then VS could create new one near .exe.I think that another changes (checks and so on - from the another answers) triggered something and Visual Studio copied and replaced the dll and pdb from the project folder to the folder near the exe, so that was a solution.I think that the root cause of the problem is that the Visual Studio use another file in runtime, no the file from the project, with the stop.Maybe this answer to help someone !Webapplications (IIS Express) only:I was integrating a C# application with a static library using VS10 - which I\'m new to. I wrote a managed code dll to interface them.  I could set breakpoints everywhere but the static lib.  I got the message described above - no symbols have been loaded for this document.  I tried many of the suggestions above.  I could see that the symbols weren\'t being loaded.  I finally noticed a check box Configuration Debug, Enable unmanaged code debugging.  That allowed me to set breakpoints in the static lib functions.For an ASP.Net application, check the properties of the site, ASP.NET tab.  Ensure that the correct ASP.NET version is selected.I also had the same issue what I rebuild the whole solution (including refereced projects) in x86( or x64)Even though I set all of my projects to x86 from Configuration Manager (Build->ConfigManager) some of my projects werent set to x86.So Just to make sure right click on project->properties->Debug Tab, verify Configuration and Platform.I have read carefully all the answers above, but none of them solved my problem.In my case, I was compiling a class library (DLL). No modules seem to be loaded in Debug -> Modules, so I couldn\'t even load the symbols manually.My solution was to add this line to my code:Once this code is reached, an exception is triggered and .NET Framework shows a dialog box asking which Visual Studio (i.e. new instance of VS 2008, new instance of VS 2013, etc) you want to use to debug the program. You can choose the existing instance of VS with your project loaded. This will attach the process to your VS session and load all symbols, and now you can debug your project.Of course, the compilation has to be done using the Debug configuration, not Release.Project Properties (then select your build config) > Build Tab > Advanced... > Debug Info (dropdown)Set to \'all\' or \'pdb-only\' then rebuildThis took me a while tried other options above and for some strange reason debugging stopped working.Tool->Options->Debugging->General->(untick)"Require source files to exactly match the original version"this happened to me after copy paste another webservice asmx file into an existing webservice, resulting in the same error when trying to debug the recently added service, to be able to debug I had to start without debug, then attach to the process. its weird but its the only way i found to be able to debug.I tried all of these and could not get my break-point working...What i did to fix this issue wasIn the page where my break-point was not hitting, i selected the folder > add an existing item and then select the page from its save path. This allowed the break point to start working.If we get the latest from VSTS, all files will be in read only mode. While running project all class library classes get read only and brakepoints turn empty and say "Breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols loaded for this document". Solution 1Go to the project location and right lick the folder ---> Properties ---> General Tab ---> UNCHECK read-only (Only applies to files in the folder) ---> Apply ---> OkSolution 2Start debugging, Go to Debug ---> Windows ---> Modules.Select one assembly and Right-click ---> (Select) Symbol Setting. Set Your Bin path in Cache symbol in this directory and select Microsoft Servers in Symbol of PDB location. Click Load All Symbols. It will take time.Then click OK.Now the symbol status of all assembly has been changed from "can not find or open PDB" to "Symbols loaded".
