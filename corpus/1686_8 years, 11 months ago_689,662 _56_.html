I have a PHP script that can encode a PNG image to a Base64 string.I\'d like to do the same thing using JavaScript. I know how to open files, but I\'m not sure how to do the encoding? I\'m not used to working with binary data.You can use btoa() and atob() to convert to and from base64 encoding.There appears to be some confusion in the comments regarding what these functions accept/return, so\xe2\x80\xa6btoa() accepts a \xe2\x80\x9cstring\xe2\x80\x9d where each character represents an 8-bit byte \xe2\x80\x93 if you pass a string containing characters that can\xe2\x80\x99t be represented in 8 bits, it will probably break. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem if you\xe2\x80\x99re actually treating the string as a byte array, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do something else then you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to encode it first.atob() returns a \xe2\x80\x9cstring\xe2\x80\x9d where each character represents an 8-bit byte \xe2\x80\x93 that is, its value will be between 0 and 0xff. This does not mean it\xe2\x80\x99s ASCII \xe2\x80\x93 presumably if you\xe2\x80\x99re using this function at all, you expect to be working with binary data and not text.From here:Also, search on "javascript base64 encoding" turns a lot of other options, the above was the first one.Sunny\'s code is great except it breaks in IE7 because of references to "this".   Fixed by replacing such references with "Base64":You can use btoa (to base-64) and atob (from base-64). For IE 9 and below, try the jquery-base64 plugin:jsFiddleHere is how you encode normal text to base64 in Node.js:And here is how you decode base64 encoded strings:To encode an array of bytes using dojox.encoding.base64:To decode a base64-encoded string:There\'s a couple of bugs in both implementations of _utf8_decode. c1 and c2 are assigned as global variables due to broken use of the var statement, and c3 is not initialized or declared at all.It works, but these variables will overwrite any existing ones with the same name outside this function.Here\'s a version that won\'t do this:I +1\'ed Sunny\'s answer, but I wanted to contribute back a few changes I made for my own project in case anyone should find it useful. Basically I\'ve just cleaned up the original code a little so JSLint doesn\'t complain quite as much, and I made the methods marked as private in the comments actually private. I also added two methods I needed in my own project, namely decodeToHex and encodeFromHex.The code:I have re-wrote by hand, these encoding and decoding methods with the exception of the hexadecimal one into a modular format for cross-platform / browser compatibility and also with real private scoping, and uses btoa and atob if they exist due to speed rather than utilize its own encoding:https://gist.github.com/Nijikokun/5192472Usage:To make a Base64 encoded String URL friendly, in JavaScript you could do something like this:See also this Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/magikMaker/7bjaT/if you need to encode HTML image object,\nyou can write simple function like:To get base64 of image by id:more herePlease note that this is not suitable for raw Unicode strings! See Unicode section here.Syntax for encodingvar encodedData = window.btoa(stringToEncode);Syntax for decodingvar decodedData = window.atob(encodedData);Contributing with a minified polyfill for window.atob + window.btoa that I\'m currently using.I\'d rather use the bas64 encode/decode methods from CryptoJS, the most popular library for standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns.Here is an AngularJS Factory version of @user850789\'s one:I needed encoding of an UTF-8 string as base64 for a project of mine. Most of the answers here don\'t seem to properly handle UTF-16 surrogate pairs when converting to UTF-8 so, for completion sake, I will post my solution:Note that the code is not thoroughly tested. I tested some inputs, including things like strToUTF8Base64(\'\xe8\xa1\xa0\xe8\xa1\xa2\xe8\xa0\xa9\xe8\xa0\xa8\') and compared with the output of an online encoding tool (https://www.base64encode.org/).This question and it\'s answers pointed me to the right direction.\nEspecially with unicode atob and btoa can not be used "vanilla" and these days EVERYTHING is unicode ..  Directly from Mozilla, two nice functions for this purpose (tested with unicode and html tags inside)These functions will perform lightning fast in comparison to raw base64 decoding using a custom javascript function as btoa and atob are executed outside the interpreter.If you can ignore old IE and old mobile phones (like iphone 3?) this should be a good solution.For my project I still need to support IE7 and work with large input to encode.Based on the code proposed by Joe Dyndale and as suggested in comment by Marius, it is possible to improve the performance with IE7 by constructing the result with an array instead of a string.Here is the example for encode:Well, if you are using dojo, it gives us direct way to encode or decode into base64.Try this:-To encode an array of bytes using dojox.encoding.base64:To decode a base64-encoded string:While a bit more work, if you want a high performance native solution there are some HTML5 functions you can use.If you can get your data into a Blob, then you can use the FileReader.readAsDataURL() function to get a data:// URL and chop off the front of it to get at the base64 data.You may have to do further processing however to urldecode the data, as I\'m not sure whether + characters are escaped or not for the data:// URL, but this should be pretty trivial.From the comments (by SET and Stephan Steiger) below the accepted answer, here is a quick summary of how to encode/decode a string to/from base64 without need of a library.(uses jQuery library, but not for encode/decode)
