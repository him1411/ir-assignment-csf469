I have the following codeWhen running the code I am getting the error pasted in the title after adding the two joins for table C.  I think this may have something to do with the fact i\'m using sql 2008 and have restored a copy of this db on to my machine which is 2005.  Please help!You have a mismatch of two different collations in your table. You can check what collations each column in your table(s) has by using this query:Collations are needed and used when ordering and comparing strings. It\'s generally a good idea to have a single, unique collation used throughout your database - don\'t use different collations within a single table or database - you\'re only asking for trouble....Once you\'ve settled for one single collation, you can change those tables / columns that don\'t match yet using this command:MarcUPDATE:  to find the fulltext indices in your database, use this query here:You can then drop the fulltext index using:I do the following:Works every time. :)Use the collate clause in your query:I may not have the syntax exactly right (check BOL), but you can do this to change the collation on-the-fly for the query - you may need to add the clause for each join.edit: I realized this was not quite right - the collate clause goes after the field you need to change - in this example I changed the collation on the tA.oldValue field. Identify the fields for which it is throwing this error and add following to them:\n COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULTThere are two tables joined on Code field:Update your query to:@Valkyrie awesome answer.  Thought I put in here a case when performing the same with a subquery insides a stored procedure, as I wondered if your answer works in this case, and it did awesome....WHERE fieldname COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT in (\n          select distinct otherfieldname COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT\n          from ...\n          where ...\n        )This can easily happen when you have 2 different databases and specially 2 different databases from 2 different servers. Best option is to change it to a common collection and do the join or comparison. The root cause is that the sql server database you took the schema from has a collation that differs from your local installation.  If you don\'t want to worry about collation re install SQL Server locally using the same collation as the SQL Server 2008 database.I have had something like this before, and what we found was that the collation between 2 tables were different. Check that these are the same.For those who have a CREATE DATABASE script (as was my case) for the database that is causing this issue you can use the following CREATE script to match the collation:orThis applies the desired collation to all the tables, which was just what I needed. It is ideal to try and keep the collation the same for all databases on a server.\nHope this helps.More info on the following link: SQL SERVER \xe2\x80\x93 Creating Database with Different Collation on ServerThanks to marc_s\'s answer I solved my original problem - inspired to take it a step further and post one approach to transforming a whole table at a time - tsql script to generate the alter column statements:gets:\n    ALTER TABLE Affiliate ALTER COLUMN myTable NVARCHAR(4000) COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AS  NOT NULLI\'ll admit to being puzzled by the need to col.max_length / 2 - I have used the content from this site to create the following script which changes collation of all columns in all tables:I had a similar error (Cannot resolve the collation conflict between "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS" and "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1250_CI_AS" in the INTERSECT operation), when I used old jdbc driver.I resolved this by downloading new driver from Microsoft or open-source project jTDS.here is what we did, in our situation we need an ad hoc query to be executed using a date restriction on demand, and the query is defined in a table.Our new query needs to match data between different databases and include data from both of them.It seems that the COLLATION is different between the db that imports data from the iSeries/AS400 system, and our reporting database - this could be because of the specific data types (such as Greek accents on names and so on).So we used the below join clause:ALTER DATABASE test2 -- put your database name here\n   COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS   -- replace with whatever collation you needYou could easily do this by using 4 easy stepsCheck the level of collation that is mismatched (server, database,table,column,character). If it is the server, these steps helped me once:Run this command:sqlservr -m -T4022 -T3659 -s"name_of_insance" \n-q "name_of_collation"Start your sql server:net start name_of_instanceCheck the collation of your server again.Here is more info:https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3519/changing-sql-server-collation-after-installation/
