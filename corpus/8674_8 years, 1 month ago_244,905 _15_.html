Is there a recommended way to escape <, >, " and & characters when outputting HTML in plain Java code?  (Other than manually doing the following, that is).StringEscapeUtils from Apache Commons Lang:For version 3:An alternative to Apache Commons: Use Spring\'s HtmlUtils.htmlEscape(String input) method.There is a newer version of the Apache Commons Lang library and it uses a different package name (org.apache.commons.lang3). The StringEscapeUtils now has different static methods for escaping different types of documents (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.0/index.html). So to escape HTML version 4.0 string:Nice short method:Based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/8838023/1199155 (the amp is missing there). The four characters checked in the if clause are the only ones below 128, according to http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html On android (API 16 or greater) you can:or for lower API:Be careful with this.  There are a number of different \'contexts\' within an HTML document: Inside an element, quoted attribute value, unquoted attribute value, URL attribute, javascript, CSS, etc...  You\'ll need to use a different encoding method for each of these to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  Check the OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet for details on each of these contexts -- https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.  You can find escaping methods for each of these contexts in the OWASP ESAPI library -- https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy.  For those who use Google Guava:For some purposes, HtmlUtils:While @dfa answer of org.apache.commons.lang.StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml is nice and I have used it in the past it should not be used for escaping HTML (or XML) attributes otherwise the whitespace will be normalized (meaning all adjacent whitespace characters become a single space).I know this because I have had bugs filed against my library (JATL) for attributes where whitespace was not preserved. Thus I have a drop in (copy n\' paste) class (of which I stole some from JDOM) that differentiates the escaping of attributes and element content.While this may not have mattered as much in the past (proper attribute escaping) it is increasingly become of greater interest given the use use of HTML5\'s data- attribute usage.
