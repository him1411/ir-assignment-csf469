I don\'t think I fundamentally understand what an enum is, and when to use it.  For example:What is really being declared here?Three things are being declared here: an anonymous enumerated type is declared, ShapeType is being declared a typedef for that anonymous enumeration, and the three names kCircle, kRectangle, and kOblateSpheroid are being declared as integral constants.Let\'s break that down.  In the simplest case, an enumeration can be declared asThis declares an enumeration with the tag tagname.  In C and Objective-C (but not C++), any references to this must be preceded with the enum keyword.  For example:In order to avoid having to use the enum keyword everywhere, a typedef can be created:This can be simplified into one line:And finally, if we don\'t need to be able to use enum tagname with the enum keyword, we can make the enum anonymous and only declare it with the typedef name:Now, in this case, we\'re declaring ShapeType to be a typedef\'ed name of an anonymous enumeration.  ShapeType is really just an integral type, and should only be used to declare variables which hold one of the values listed in the declaration (that is, one of kCircle, kRectangle, and kOblateSpheroid).  You can assign a ShapeType variable another value by casting, though, so you have to be careful when reading enum values.Finally, kCircle, kRectangle, and kOblateSpheroid are declared as integral constants in the global namespace.  Since no specific values were specified, they get assigned to consecutive integers starting with 0, so kCircle is 0, kRectangle is 1, and kOblateSpheroid is 2.Apple recommends defining enums like this since Xcode 4.4:They also provide a handy macro NS_ENUM:These definitions provide stronger type checking and better code completion. I could not find an official documentation of NS_ENUM, but you can watch "Modern Objective-C" video from WWDC 2012 session here.UPDATE: Link to official documentation here.A enum declares a set of ordered values - the typedef just adds a handy name to this. The 1st element is 0 etc. The above is just a enumeration of shapeType tags.A user defined type that has the possible values of kCircle, kRectangle, or kOblateSpheroid.  The values inside the enum (kCircle, etc) are visible outside the enum, though. It\'s important to keep that in mind (int i = kCircle; is valid, for example).Update for 64-bit Change:\nAccording to apple docs about 64-bit changes,Enumerations Are Also Typed : In the LLVM compiler, enumerated types can\n  define the size of the enumeration. This means that some enumerated\n  types may also have a size that is larger than you expect. The\n  solution, as in all the other cases, is to make no assumptions about a\n  data type\xe2\x80\x99s size. Instead, assign any enumerated values to a variable\n  with the proper data typeSo you have to create enum with type as below syntax if you support for 64-bit.or Otherwise, it will lead to warning as Implicit conversion loses integer precision: NSUInteger (aka \'unsigned long\') to ShapeTypeUpdate for swift-programming:In swift, there\'s an syntax change.Enum is user defined data type. \nENUMERATED DATA TYPES\nEnumerated data type variables can only assume values which have been previously declared.In the above declaration, month is declared as an enumerated data type. It consists of a set of values, jan to dec. Numerically, jan is given the value 1, feb the value 2, and so on.The variable this_month is declared to be of the same type as month, then is assigned the value associated with feb. This_month cannot be assigned any values outside those specified in the initialization list for the declaration of month.The enum (abbreviation of enumeration) is used to enumerate a set of values (enumerators). A value is any abstract thing represented by a symbol (an word).\nFor example a basic enum could beThis enum is called anonymous because you do not have a symbol to name it. But it is still perfectly correct. Just use it like thisOk. The life is beautiful and everything goes well. But one day you need to reuse this enum to define a new variable to store myGrandFatherPantSize, then you write:But then you have a compiler error "redefinition of enumerator". Actually the problem is that the compiler is not sure that you first enum and your second describe the same thing.Then if you want to reuse the same set of enumerators (here xs...xxxxl) in several places you must tag it with a unique name. The second time you use this set you just have to use the tag. But don\'t forget that this tag does not replace the enum word but just the set of enumerators. Then take care to use enum as usual. Like this:you can use it in a parameter definition as well:You could say that rewriting enum everywhere is not convenient and makes the code looks a bit strange. You are right. A real type would be better.This is the final step of our great progression to the summit. By just adding a typedef let\'s transform our enum in a real type.  Oh a last thing, typedef is not allowed within your class. Then define your type just above.   Do it like this:Remember that the tag is optional. Then since here in that case, we do not to tag the enumerators but just to define a new type. Then we don\'t really need it anymore.If you are developing in ObjectiveC with XCode I let you discover some nice macros prefixed with NS_ENUM. That should help you to define good enums easily and moreover will help the static analyzer to do some interesting checks for you before to compile.Good Enum !typedef is useful for redefining the name of an existing variable type. It provides short & meaningful way to call a datatype.\ne.g:here, the type unsigned long int is redefined to be of the type TWOWORDS. Thus, we can now declare variables of type unsigned long int by writing,instead of then you can use it like :-  andnow you can use it like:-enum is used to assign value to enum elements which cannot be done in struct. So everytime instead of accessing the complete variable we can do it by the value we assign to the variables in enum. By default it starts with 0 assignment but we can assign it any value and the next variable in enum will be assigned a value the previous value +1.A typedef allows the programmer to define one Objective-C type as another. For example,typedef int Counter; defines the type Counter to be equivalent to the int type. This drastically improves code readability.The Typedef is a Keyword in C and C++. It is used to create new names for basic data types (char, int, float, double, struct & enum).Here it creates enumerated data type ShapeType & we can write new names for enum type ShapeType as given belowYou can use in the below format, Raw default value starting from 0, so You can assign your own specific start value.
