How can you put uncommitted changes to a branch TEST when I am at the branch master?You can just checkout to the test branch and then commit. You don\'t lose your uncommited changes when moving to another branch.Supposing you are at the master branch:I am not really sure about the deleted files, but I guess they aren\'t included when you use git add .Also you can create a new branch and switch to it by doing:I use this all the time because I always forget to start a new branch before I start editing code.Why not just use git stash. I think it\'s more intuitive like a copy-and-paste.You have some files in your current branch that you want to move.Move to the other branch. And applyI also like git stash because I use git flow, which complains when you want to finish a feature branch whilst having changes still in your working directory. Just like @Mike Bethany,  this happens to me all the time because I work on a new problem while forgetting I am still on another branch. So you can stash your work, git flow feature finish...,  and git stash apply to new git flow feature start ... branch.
