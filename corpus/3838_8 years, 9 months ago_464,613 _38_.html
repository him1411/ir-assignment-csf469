How do I Deserialize this XML document:I have this:..that don\'t seem to work :-(Here\'s a working version.  I changed the XmlElementAttribute labels to XmlElement because in the xml the StockNumber, Make and Model values are elements, not attributes.  Also I removed the reader.ReadToEnd(); (that function reads the whole stream and returns a string, so the Deserialze() function couldn\'t use the reader anymore...the position was at the end of the stream).  I also took a few liberties with the naming :).Here are the classes:The Deserialize function:And the slightly tweaked xml (I needed to add a new element to wrap <Cars>...Net is picky about deserializing arrays):How about you just save the xml to a file, and use xsd?Et voila - and C# code file that should be able to read the data via XmlSerializer:(include the generated foo.cs in the project)You have two possibilities. And that\'s it! You have generated C# classes from xml file in C:\\path\\to\\xml\\file.csAnd that\'s it! Usage is very simple with this helper class:All you have to do now, is:The following snippet should do the trick (and you can ignore most of the serialization attributes):...See if this helps:.And failing that use the xsd.exe program that comes with visual studio to create a schema document based on that xml file, and then use it again to create a class based on the schema document.I don\'t think .net is \'picky about deserializing arrays\'. The first xml document is not well formed.\nThere is no root element, although it looks like there is. The canonical xml document has a root and at least 1 element (if at all). In your example:try this block of code if your .xml file has been generated somewhere in disk and if you have used List<T>:Note: C:\\serialize.xml is my .xml file\'s path. You can change it for your needs. The idea is to have all level being handled for deserialization\nPlease see  a sample solution that solved my similar issueThe above XML is handled in  two level The Inner level Same Way you need multiple level with car as array\nCheck this example for multilevel  deserializationTry this Generic Class For Xml Serialization & Deserialization.                   If you\'re getting errors using xsd.exe to create your xsd file, then use the XmlSchemaInference class  as mentioned on msdn.  Here\'s a unit test to demonstrate:You can just change one attribute for you Cars car property from XmlArrayItem to XmlElment. That is, fromto My solution:Code: NOTE: you must pay attention to the root name, don\'t change it. Mine is "ArrayOfClass1"
