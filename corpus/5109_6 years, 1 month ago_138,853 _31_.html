What I need to doI have a timezone-unaware datetime object, to which I need to add a time zone in order to be able to compare it with other timezone-aware datetime objects.  I do not want to convert my entire application to timezone unaware for this one legacy case.What I\'ve TriedFirst, to demonstrate the problem:First, I tried astimezone:It\'s not terribly surprising this failed, since it\'s actually trying to do a conversion.  Replace seemed like a better choice (as per Python: How to get a value of datetime.today() that is "timezone aware"?):But as you can see, replace seems to set the tzinfo, but not make the object aware.  I\'m getting ready to fall back to doctoring the input string to have a timezone before parsing it (I\'m using dateutil for parsing, if that matters), but that seems incredibly kludgy.Also, I\'ve tried this in both python 2.6 and python 2.7, with the same results.ContextI am writing a parser for some data files.  There is an old format I need to support where the date string does not have a timezone indicator.  I\'ve already fixed the data source, but I still need to support the legacy data format.  A one time conversion of the legacy data is not an option for various business BS reasons.  While in general, I do not like the idea of hard-coding a default timezone, in this case it seems like the best option.  I know with reasonable confidence that all the legacy data in question is in UTC, so I\'m prepared to accept the risk of defaulting to that in this case.In general, to make a naive datetime timezone-aware, use the localize method:For the UTC timezone, it is not really necessary to use localize since there is no daylight savings time calculation to handle:works. (.replace returns a new datetime; it does not modify unaware.)I had use from dt_aware to dt_unwareand dt_unware to dt_aware but answer before is also a good solution.All of these examples use an external module. You can achieve the same just using the datetime module.Fewer dependencies and no pytz issues.NOTE: If you wish to use this with python3 and python2, you can use this as well for the timezone import (hardcoded for UTC):I use this statement in Django to convert an unaware time to an aware:This codifies @S\xc3\xa9rgio and @unutbu\'s answers. It will "just work" with either a pytz.timezone object or an IANA Time Zone string.This seems like what datetime.localize() (or .inform() or .awarify()) should do, accept both strings and timezone objects for the tz argument and default to UTC if no time zone is specified.I agree with the previous answers, and is fine if you are ok to start in UTC. But I think it is also a common scenario for people to work with a tz aware value that has a datetime that has a non UTC local timezone.If you were to just go by name, one would probably infer replace() will be applicable and produce the right datetime aware object.  This is not the case.the replace( tzinfo=... ) seems to be random in its behaviour.  It is therefore useless. Do not use this!localize is the correct function to use. Example:In the format of unutbu\'s answer; I made a utility module that handles things like this, with more intuitive syntax. Can be installed with pip.In order to add local timezone; (using dateutil)two method I know purelyorof course,you can use any timezone instead of UTC,
