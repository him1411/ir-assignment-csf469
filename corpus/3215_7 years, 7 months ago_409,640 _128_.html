Is it possible to set the src attribute value in CSS? At present, what iI am doing is:and I want it to be something like thisI want to do this without using the background or background-image: properties in CSS.Use content:url("image.jpg").Full working solution (Live Demo):Tested and working:Tested and Not working:There is a solution that I found out today (works in IE6+, FF, Opera, Chrome):How it works:It also works for submit-input-images, they stay clickable.See live demo: http://www.audenaerde.org/csstricks.html#imagereplacecssEnjoy! CSS2\'s :after pseudo-element or the newer syntax ::after from CSS3 along with the content: property:  First W3C Recommendation: Cascading Style Sheets, level 2\nCSS2 Specification 12 May 1998\nLatest W3C Recommendation: Selectors Level 3\nW3C Recommendation 29 September 2011This method appends content just after an element\'s document tree content.Note: some browsers experimentally render the content property directly over some element selectors disregarding even the latest W3C recommendation that defines:Applies to: :before and :after pseudo-elements  CSS2 syntax (forward-compatible):  CSS3 Selector:  Default rendering: Original Size (does not depend on explicit size declaration)This specification does not fully define the interaction of :before and :after with replaced elements (such as IMG in HTML). This will be defined in more detail in a future specification.but even at the time of this writing, behaviour with a <IMG> tag is still not defined and although it can be used in a hacked and non standards compliant way, usage with <img> is not recommended!Great candidate method, see conclusions...First W3C Recommendation: Cascading Style Sheets, level 1 17 Dec 1996 This property sets the background image of an element. When setting a background image, one should also set a background color that will be used when the image is unavailable. When the image is available, it is overlaid on top of the background color.  This property has been around from the beginning of CSS and nevertheless it deserve a glorious mention.Default rendering: Original Size (cannot be scaled, only positioned)However,  CSS3\'s background-size: property improved on it by allowing multiple scaling options:  Latest W3C Status: Candidate Recommendation CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3 9 September 2014 [length> | <percentage> | auto ]{1,2} | cover | containBut even with this property, it depends on container size.Still a good candidate method, see conclusions...CSS2\'s list-style: property along with display: list-item: First W3C Recommendation: Cascading Style Sheets, level 2\nCSS2 Specification 12 May 1998 list-style-image: property sets the image that will be used as the list item marker (bullet)The list properties describe basic visual formatting of lists: they allow style sheets to specify the marker type (image, glyph, or number)display: list-item â€” This value causes an element (e.g., <li> in HTML) to generate a principal block box and a marker box.Shorthand CSS: (<list-style-type> <list-style-position> <list-style-image>)  Default rendering: Original Size (does not depend on explicit size declaration)Restrictions:  Inheritance will transfer the \'list-style\' values from OL and UL elements to LI elements. This is the recommended way to specify list style information.  They do not allow authors to specify distinct style (colors, fonts, alignment, etc.) for the list marker or adjust its positionThis method is also not suitable for the <img> tag as the conversion cannot be made between element types, and here\'s the limited, non compliant hack that doesn\'t work on Chrome.  Good candidate method, see conclusions...CSS3\'s border-image: property recommendation:Latest W3C Status: Candidate Recommendation CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3 9 September 2014 A background-type method that relies on specifying sizes in a rather peculiar manner (not defined for this use case) and fallback border properties so far (eg. border: solid):  Note that, even though they never cause a scrolling mechanism, outset \n  images may still be clipped by an ancestor or by the viewport. This example illustrates the image being composed only as a bottom-right corner decoration:Applies to: All elements, except internal table elements when border-collapse: collapse Still it can\'t change an <img>\'s tag src (but here\'s a hack), instead we can decorate it: Good candidate method to be considered after standards propagate.CSS3\'s element() notation working draft is worth a mention also:Note: The element() function only reproduces the appearance of the referenced element, not the actual content and its structure.We\'ll use the rendered contents of one of the two hidden images to change the image background in #img1 based on the ID Selector via CSS:Notes: It\'s experimental and only works with the -moz prefix in Firefox and only over background or background-image properties, also needs sizes specified.Having said that, let\'s explore HTML tags fit for image display:Perfect usecase of the list-style-image with display: list-item method.The <li> element, can be empty, allows flow content and it\'s even permitted to omit the </li> end tag.Limitations: hard to style (width: or float: might help)The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained (like a complete sentence) and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.The element is valid with no content, but is recommended to contain a <figcaption>.The element can thus be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.Default rendering: the element is right aligned, with both left and right padding!  To include images, authors may use the OBJECT element or the IMG element.The data attribute is required and can have a valid MIME type as a value!  Note: a trick to make use of the <object> tag from CSS would be to set a  custom valid MimeType x-image/x followed by no data (value has no data after the required comma ,)Default rendering: 300 x 150px, but size can be specified either in HTML or CSS.Needs a SVG capable browser and has a  <image> element for raster imagesThe width attribute defaults to 300, and the height attribute defaults to 150.Limitations:  ... the element is expected to appear button-like to indicate that the element is a button.  which Chrome follows and renders a 4x4px empty square when no textPartial solution, set value=" ":  Also watch out for the upcoming <picture> element in HTML5.1, currently a working draft.i used the empty div solution, with this CSS:HTML:They are right. IMG is a content element and CSS is about design.\nBut, how about when you use some content elements or properties for design purposes?\nI have IMG across my web pages that must change if i change the style (the CSS).Well this is a solution for defining IMG presentation (no really the image) in CSS style.It works like a charm :)I found a better way than the proposed solutions, but it does use the background-image indeed.\nCompliant method (cannot confirm for IE6) \nCredits: http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/lir/The CSS:The old image is not seen and the new is seen as expected.\nThe following neat solution only works for webkitHere is a very good solution -> http://css-tricks.com/replace-the-image-in-an-img-with-css/\n\nPro(s) and Con(s): \n(+) works with vector image that have relative width/height (a thing that RobAu\'s answer does not handle) \n(+) is cross browser (works also for IE8+)\n(+) it only uses CSS. So no need to modify the img src (or if you do not have access/do not want to change the already existing img src attribute).\n(-) sorry, it does use the background css attribute :)You can define 2 images in your HTML code and use display: none; to decide which one will be visible.As far as I am aware of, YOU CANNOT. CSS is about style and image\'s src is content.Put several images in a "controlling" container, and change the container\'s class instead. In CSS, add rules to manage images\' visibility depending on the container\'s class. This will produce the same effect as changing img src property of a a single image.HTML:CSS:Note that it will preload all images, like with CSS backround-images, but unlike changing img src via JS.No you can\'t set the image src attribute via CSS. The closest you can get is, as you say, background or background-image. I wouldn\'t recommend doing that anyway as it would be somewhat illogical.However, there is a CSS3 solution available to you, if the browsers you\'re targeting are able to use it. Use content:url as described in Pacerier\'s answer. You can find other, cross-browser solutions in the other answers below.To reiterate a prior solution and to stress the pure CSS implementation here is my answer.  A Pure CSS solution is needed in cases where you are sourcing content from another site, and thus you have no control over the HTML that is delivered.  In my case I am trying to remove branding of licensed source content so that the licencee does not have to advertise for the company they are buying the content from.  Therefore, I\'m removing their logo while keeping everything else.  I should note that this is within my client\'s contract to do so.Alternative wayI know this is a really old question however no answers provide the proper reasoning for why this can never be done.  While you can "do" what you are looking for you cannot do it in a valid way.  In order to have a valid img tag it must have the src and alt attributes.So any of the answers giving a way to do this with an img tag that does not use the src attribute are promoting use of invalid code.In short: what you are looking for cannot be done legally within the structure of the syntax.Source: W3 ValidatorIf you don\'t want to set a background property then you can\'t set the src attribute of an image using only CSS.Alternatively you can use JavaScript to do such a thing.Using CSS, it can\'t be done. But, if you are using JQuery, something like this will do the trick:Or you could do this which I found on the interweb thingy.https://robau.wordpress.com/2012/04/20/override-image-src-in-css/So effectively hiding the image and padding down the background.  Oh what a hack  but if you want an IMG tag with alt text and a background that can scale without using JavaScript?In a project I\'m working on now I created a hero block twig templateYou can convert it with JS:If you are trying to add an image in a button dynamically based on the context of your project, you can use the ? take to reference the source based on an outcome.  Here I am using mvvm design to let my Model.Phases[0] value determine whether I want my button to be populated with images of a lightbulb on or off based on the value of the light phase.Not sure if this helps.  I\'m using JqueryUI, Blueprint, and CSS.  The class definition should allow you to style the button based on whatever you\'d like.I would add this: background image could be also positioned with background-position: x y; (x horizontal y vertical). (..)\nMy case, CSS: HTMl Code:    Css Code:I\'ve been studying html after school for a few days, and wanted to know how to do this. Found out the background and then put 2 and 2 together.\nThis works 100% I checked, if not make sure you fill in necessary things!!!\nWe need to specify height, because without it there would be nothing!!!\nI\'ll leave this basic shell you can add-on.Example:P.S. Yes I am a Linux user ;)Any method based on background or background-image is likely to fail when user prints the document with "print background colors and images" disabled.\nWhich is unfortunately typical browser\'s default.The only print-friendly and cross-browser compatible method here is the one proposed by Bronx.Just use HTML5 :)
