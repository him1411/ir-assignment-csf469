I\'m getting started working with Docker. I\'m using the WordPress base image and docker-compose. I\'m trying to ssh into one of the containers to inspect the files/directories that were created during the initial build. I tried to run docker-compose run containername ls -la but that didn\'t do anything. Even if it did, I\'d rather have a console where I can traverse the directory structure, rather than run a single command. What is the right way to do this with Docker?docker attach will let you connect to your Docker container, but this isn\'t really the same thing as ssh.  If your container is running a webserver, for example, docker attach will probably connect you to the stdout of the web server process.  It won\'t necessarily give you a shell.The docker exec command is probably what you are looking for; this will let you run arbitrary commands inside an existing container.  For example:Of course, whatever command you are running must exist in the container filesystem.In the above command <mycontainer> is the name or ID of the target container.  It doesn\'t matter whether or not you\'re using docker compose; just run docker ps and use either the ID (a hexadecimal string displayed in the first column) or the name (displayed in the final column).  E.g., given:I can run:I could accomplish the same thing by running:Similarly, I could start a shell in the container;To bash into a running container, type this:Let\'s say, for reasons that are your own, you really do want to use SSH. It takes a few steps, but it can be done. Here are the commands that you would run inside the container to set it up...Now you can even run graphical applications (if they are installed in the container) using X11 forwarding to the SSH client:Here are some related resources:Notice: this answer promotes a tool I\'ve written.I\'ve created a containerized SSH server that you can \'stick\' to any running container. This way you can create compositions with every container. The only requirement is that the container has Bash.The following example would start an SSH server attached to a container with name \'my-container\'.When you connect to this SSH service (with your SSH client of choice) a Bash session will be started in the container with name \'my-container\'.For more pointers and documentation see: https://github.com/jeroenpeeters/docker-sshSSH into a Docker container using this command:The following simple command should take you into the Docker container. Replace <container-id> with the real docker container ID.docker exec will definitely be a solution. An easy way to work with the question you asked is by mounting the directory inside Docker to the local system\'s directory.So that you can view the changes in local path instantly.The other way albeit there is a danger to is use attach, but if you ctrl-c to exit the session you will also stop the container. -- if you are just wanting to see what is happening use  docker logs -f Another option is to use nsenter.If you\'re using Docker on Windows and want to get shell access to a container, use this:Most likely, you already have Git Bash installed. If you don\'t, make sure to install it.To connect to cmd in windows container, usedocker exec -it d8c25fde2769 cmdTo inspect files run docker run -it <image> /bin/bash to get interactive terminal. List of images can be obtained by docker images. In contrary to docker exec this solution works also in case when image doesn\'t start (or quits immediately after running).For docker-compose up (Docker4Drupal)docker-compose exec php bash
