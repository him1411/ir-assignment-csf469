Is there a way to see what\'s been saved to NSUserDefaults directly?  I\'d like to see if my data saved correctly.  You can find the pList file for your app in the simulator if you go to:/users/your user name/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/<Sim Version>/ApplicationsThis directory has a bunch of GUID named directories.  If you are working on a few apps there will be a few of them.  So you need to find your app binary:Then go to the Library/Preferences directory in the GUID directory.  So:You should find a file that looks like:Open this up in the pList editor and browse persisted values to your heart\'s content.You can print all current NSUserDefaults to the log:Just keys:Keys and values:We can use dump here as well, but that will return the complete inheritance hierarchy of each element in the values array. If more information about the objects is required, then use dump, else go ahead with the normal print statement.You can check the values for each key in the array, returned byI sometimes use the following snippet to print out the location of my NSUserDefaults file when running in the simulatorIt yields the path to the preferences folderYour NSUserDefaults are stored in this folder: /Users/castle/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/User/Applications/BC5056A0-F46B-4AF1-A6DC-3A7DAB984960/Library/PreferencesYour NSUserDefaults file is located in the preferences folder and named according to your prefix and appliation name e.g.I expect the same to be true for the actual device.In Swift 2.0because dictionaryRepresentation of NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults() returns [String : AnyObject]We cast it into an NSDictionary. Then by surrounding it in parenthesis \'()\' will allow us to to call .allKeys or .allValues just as you would on any NSDictionaryEasy, since the plist file name is <app-bundle-identifier>.plist, you can use find command to find its path. But it will take very long if you search your whole computer, so you have to pick a good scope, like ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator for Xcode 6.example:find ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator -type f -name com.awesome.app.plistthe output will be something like this.../Users/hlung/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/B61913F6-7D7C-4E45-AE2F-F45220A71823/data/Containers/Data/Application/E4CC51CF-11E5-4168-8A74-6BAE3B89998F/Library/Preferences/com.awesome.app.plist\nAnd from there you can use open command. Or if you use iTerm2, just command-click on the path to open it.For Xcode 7NSUserDefaults standardDefaults are stored here:/Users/{USER}/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/{UUID}/data/Containers/Data/Application/{UUID}NSUserDefaults for a suite/app group are stored here:/Users/{USER}/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/{UUID}/data/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/{UUID}/Library/Preferences/{GROUP_NAME}.plistI would recommend using https://github.com/scinfu/NCSimulatorPlugin because these days everything is behind UUIDs and are a pain to find. It allows easy access to your simulator app directories.Use below code.I built this method based on Morion\'s suggestion for better presentation. Use it by calling [self logAllUserDefaults]You could NSLog each value you set, like:Look for the Mac app called SimPholders2.  It lives in the menu bar, and lists all of the simulators you\'ve used, and then shows each of your apps.  Select one and you get a new Finder window, already open to the app\'s directory.  This makes it super easy to find your app and all of it\'s directories.  It\'s a huge time saver (and I readily donated to the author).I keep a shortcut on my desktop to the simulator\'s folder where it keeps the apps, ie:Sorted by most recent date, then just go into the most recent app folder Library/Preferences and view the file in the plist editor.This shell script search for the name of the app, obtain the bundle id, and open folders containing the Plist files.Swift 3After reading this question\'s accepted answer, I put together this simple script that opens the plist files used by the iOS simulator to store the NSUserDefaults preferences, and while it assumes a certain setup (fits mine perfectly), it may work as a starting point for others.Example placement:In Swift 2.2will print out NSUserDefaults\'s plist file folder location in Xcode debug console. Copy  the path string. Open your Finder, select Go to Folder in Go menu item, Paste the path string. Double click the plist file. You will see the contents in your Xcode editor.Only work in SimulatorThanks @Niels Castle
