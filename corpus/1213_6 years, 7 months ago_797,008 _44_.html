I want to access my current working directory using OutPut:  My output is not correct because C drive is not my current directory.\nNeed help in this regard.This will print a complete absolute path from where your application was initialized.See: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/pathOps.htmlUsing java.nio.file.Path and java.nio.file.Paths, you can do the following to show what Java thinks is your current path. This for 7 and on, and uses NIO.This outputs Current relative path is: /Users/george/NetBeansProjects/Tutorials that in my case is where I ran the class from. Constructing paths in a relative way, by not using a leading separator to indicate you are constructing an absolute path, will use this relative path as the starting point.The following works on Java 7 and up (see here for documentation).This is the solution for meWhat makes you think that c:\\windows\\system32 is not your current directory? The user.dir property is explicitly to be "User\'s current working directory".To put it another way, unless you start Java from the command line, c:\\windows\\system32 probably is your CWD. That is, if you are double-clicking to start your program, the CWD is unlikely to be the directory that you are double clicking from.Edit: It appears that this is only true for old windows and/or Java versions. Use CodeSource#getLocation(). This works fine in JAR files as well. You can obtain CodeSource by ProtectionDomain#getCodeSource() and the ProtectionDomain in turn can be obtained by Class#getProtectionDomain().generally, as a File object:you may want to have full qualified string like "D:/a/b/c" doing:I\'m on Linux and get same result for both of these approaches:Paths.get("") docsSystem.getProperty("user.dir") docsI hope you want to access the current directory including the package i.e. If your Java program is in c:\\myApp\\com\\foo\\src\\service\\MyTest.java and you want to print until c:\\myApp\\com\\foo\\src\\service then you can try the following code:Note: This code is only tested in Windows with Oracle JRE.On Linux when you run a jar file from terminal, these both will return the same String: "/home/CurrentUser", no matter, where youre jar file is. It depends just on what current directory are you using with your terminal, when you start the jar file.If your Class with main would be called MainClass, then try:This will return a String with absolute path of the jar file.Mention that it is checked only in Windows but i think it works perfect on other Operating Systems [Linux,MacOs,Solaris] :).I had 2 .jar files in the same directory . I wanted from the one .jar file to start the other .jar file which is in the same directory.The problem is that when you start it from the cmd the current directory is system32.Warnings!\xf0\x9f\x8d\x82..\xf0\x9f\x8d\x82getBasePathForClass(Class<?> classs):None of the answers posted here worked for me.  Here is what did work:Edit:  The final version in my code:assume that you\'re trying to run your project inside eclipse, or netbean or stand alone from command line. I have write a method to fix itTo use, everywhere you want to get base path to read file, you can pass your anchor class to above method, result may be the thing you need :DBest,Using Windows user.dir returns the directory as expected, but NOT when you start your application with elevated rights (run as admin), in that case you get C:\\WINDOWS\\system32Current working directory is defined differently in different Java implementations. For certain version prior to Java 7 there was no consistent way to get the working directory. You could work around this by launching Java file with -D and defining a variable to hold the infoSomething likeThat\'s not quite right, but you get the idea. Then System.getProperty("com.mycompany.workingDir")...This will give you the path of your working directory:And this will give you the path to a file called "Foo.txt" in the working directory:this is current directory name    this is current directory pathSystem.getProperty("java.class.path")
