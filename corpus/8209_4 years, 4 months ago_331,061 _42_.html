There\'s plenty solutions for installing it, listed on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java .The simplest one listed is this one:It\'ll keep your java 7 installation up to date.To automatically set up the Java 7 environment variables JAVA_HOME and PATH:and if you already have other JDK versions installedthen select the Java 7 version.In addition to flup\'s answer you might also want to run the following to set JAVA_HOME and PATH:More information at:\nhttp://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/webupd8_java/precise/main/base/oracle-java7-set-defaultDownload the 32-bit or 64-bit Linux  from "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" "compressed binary file" - it has a ".tar.gz" file extension.Uncompress itThe JDK 7 package is extracted into ./jdk1.7.0_75 directory. Now move the JDK 7 directory to /usr/libNow runThis will assign Oracle JDK a priority of 1, which means that installing other JDKs will replace it as the default. Be sure to use a higher priority if you want Oracle JDK to remain the default.Correct the file ownership and the permissions of the executables:RunYou will see output similar to the one below - choose the number of jdk1.7.0_75 - for example 3 in this list (unless you have have never installed Java installed in your computer in which case a sentence saying "There is nothing to configure" will appear):There are 3 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).Press enter to keep the current choice [*], or type selection number: 3Repeat the above for:I think you should consider Java installation procedure carefully.

First, update the package index:Then, check if Java is not already installed:If it returns "The program java can be found in the following packages", Java hasn\'t been installed yet, so execute the following command:You are fine till now as I assume.This will install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If you instead need the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is usually needed to compile Java applications (for example Apache Ant, Apache Maven, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA execute the following command:That is everything that is needed to install Java. Installing OpenJDK 7:To install OpenJDK 7, execute the following command:This will install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If you instead need the Java Development Kit (JDK), execute the following command:Installing Oracle JDK:The Oracle JDK is the official JDK; however, it is no longer provided by Oracle as a default installation for Ubuntu. You can still install it using apt-get. To install any version, first execute the following commands:Then, depending on the version you want to install, execute one of the following commands:Oracle JDK 7:Oracle JDK 8:flup\'s answer is the best but it did not work for me completely. I had to do the following as well to get it working:There is an Issue 123 currently in OAB and a pull requestHere is the patched vesion:
