I need to use UTF-8 in my resource properties using Java\'s ResourceBundle. When I enter the text directly into the properties file, it displays as mojibake.My app runs on Google App Engine.Can anyone give me an example? I can\'t get this work.The ResourceBundle#getBundle() uses under the covers PropertyResourceBundle when a .properties file is specified. This in turn uses by default Properties#load(InputStream) to load those properties files. As per the javadoc, they are by default read as ISO-8859-1. public void load(InputStream inStream) throws IOExceptionReads a property list (key and element pairs) from the input byte stream. The input stream is in a simple line-oriented format as specified in load(Reader) and is assumed to use the ISO 8859-1 character encoding; that is each byte is one Latin1 character. Characters not in Latin1, and certain special characters, are represented in keys and elements using Unicode escapes as defined in section 3.3 of The Java\xe2\x84\xa2 Language Specification.So, you\'d need to save them as ISO-8859-1. If you have any characters beyond ISO-8859-1 range and you can\'t use \\uXXXX off top of head and you\'re thus forced to save the file as UTF-8, then you\'d need to use the native2ascii tool to convert an UTF-8 saved properties file to an ISO-8859-1 saved properties file wherein all uncovered characters are converted into \\uXXXX format. The below example converts a UTF-8 encoded properties file text_utf8.properties to a valid ISO-8859-1 encoded properties file text.properties.When using a sane IDE such as Eclipse, this is already automatically done when you create a .properties file in a Java based project and use Eclipse\'s own editor. Eclipse will transparently convert the characters beyond ISO-8859-1 range to \\uXXXX format. See also below screenshots (note the "Properties" and "Source" tabs on bottom, click for large): Alternatively, you could also create a custom ResourceBundle.Control implementation wherein you explicitly read the properties files as UTF-8 using InputStreamReader, so that you can just save them as UTF-8 without the need to hassle with native2ascii. Here\'s a kickoff example:This can be used as follows:Given that you have an instance of ResourceBundle and you can get String by:I solved my Japanese display problem by:look at this : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.Reader)the properties accept an Reader object as arguments, which you can create from an InputStream.at the create time, you can specify the encoding of the Reader:then apply this Reader to the load method :BTW: get the stream from .properties file :hope this can help you !We create a resources.utf8 file that contains the resources in UTF-8 and have a rule to run the following:ResourceBundle.Control with UTF-8 and new String methods don\'t work, if the properties file uses cp1251 charset, for example. So I recomended using a common method: write in unicode symbols. For this:IDEA -- has a special "Transparent native-to-ASCII conversion" option (Settings > File Encoding).Eclipse -- has a plugin "Properties Editor". It can work as separate application.Attention: java property files should be encoded in ISO 8859-1!ISO 8859-1 character encoding.\n  Characters that cannot be directly\n  represented in this encoding can be\n  written using Unicode escapes  ; only\n  a single \'u\' character is allowed in\n  an escape sequence.@see Properties Java DocIf you still really want to do this: have a look at:\nJava properties UTF-8 encoding in Eclipse -- there are some code sampleshttp://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-rbe/as already stated property files should be encoded in ISO 8859-1You can use the above plugin for eclipse IDE to make the Unicode conversion for you.Here\'s a Java 7 solution that uses Guava\'s excellent support library and the try-with-resources construct. It reads and writes properties files using UTF-8 for the simplest overall experience.To read a properties file as UTF-8:To write a properties file as UTF-8:For what it\'s worth my issue was that the files themselves were in the wrong encoding. Using iconv worked for meAs one suggested, i went through implementation of resource bundle.. but that did not help.. as the bundle was always called under en_US locale... i tried to set my default locale to a different language and still my implementation of resource bundle control was being called with en_US... i tried to put log messages and do a step through debug and see if a different local call was being made after i change locale at run time through xhtml and JSF calls... that did not happend... then i tried to do a system set default to a utf8 for reading files by my server (tomcat server).. but that caused pronlem as all my class libraries were not compiled under utf8 and tomcat started to read then in utf8 format and server was not running properly...  then i ended up with implementing a method in my java controller to be called from xhtml files.. in that method i did the following:I was particularly nervous as this could slow down performance of my application... however, after implementing this, it looks like as if my application is faster now.. i think it is because, i am now directly accessing the properties instead of letting JSF parse its way into accessing properties... i specifically pass Boolean argument in this call because i know some of the properties would not be translated and do not need to be in utf8 format...Now I have saved my properties file in UTF8 format and it is working fine as each user in my application has a referent locale preference.I tried to use the approach provided by Rod, but taking into consideration BalusC concern about not repeating the same work-around in all the application and came with this class:The way to use this would be very similar than the regular ResourceBundle usage:Or you can use the alternate constructor which uses UTF-8 by default:
