I know you can run all the tests in a certain class using:But I want to run an individual method and -Dtest=classname.methodname  doesn\'t seem to work.To run a single test method in Maven, you need to provide the command as:where TestCircle is the test class name and xyz is the test method.Wild card characters also work; both in the method name and class name.If you\'re testing in a multi-module project, specify the module that the test is in with -pl <module-name>.For integration tests use it.test=... option instead of test=...:There is an issue with surefire 2.12.\nThis is what happen to me changing maven-surefire-plugin from 2.12 to 2.11:mvn test -Dtest=DesignRulesTestResult:\n  [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.12:test (default-test) on project pmd: No tests were executed!mvn test -Dtest=DesignRulesTestResult:\n  [INFO] --- maven-surefire-plugin:2.11:test (default-test) @ pmd ---\n  ...\n  Running net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.design.DesignRulesTest\n  Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 4, Time elapsed: 4.009 secWhat I do with my TestNG, (sorry, JUnit doesn\'t support this) test cases is I can assign a group to the test I want to runAnd then simply run \'mvn -Dgroups=broken\'.Running a set of methods in a Single Test Class\nWith version 2.7.3, you can run only n tests in a single Test Class.NOTE : it\'s supported for junit 4.x and TestNG.You must use the following syntaxYou can use patterns tooAs of surefire 2.12.1, you can select multiple methods (JUnit4X only at this time, patches welcome)Check this link about single testsNew versions of JUnit contains the Categories runner:\nhttp://kentbeck.github.com/junit/doc/ReleaseNotes4.8.htmlBut releasing procedure of JUnit is not maven based, so maven users have to put it manually to their repositories.The test parameter mentioned by tobrien allows you to specify a method using a # before the method name. This should work for JUnit and TestNG. I\'ve never tried it, just read it on the Surefire Plugin page:Specify this parameter to run individual tests by file name, overriding the includes/excludes parameters. Each pattern you specify here will be used to create an include pattern formatted like **/${test}.java, so you can just type "-Dtest=MyTest" to run a single test called "foo/MyTest.java".\n  This parameter overrides the includes/excludes parameters, and the TestNG suiteXmlFiles parameter. since 2.7.3 You can execute a limited number of method in the test with adding #myMethod or #my*ethod. Si type "-Dtest=MyTest#myMethod" supported for junit 4.x and testNgThis command works !!\n mvn "-DTest=JoinTeamTestCases#validateJoinTeam" test Note that "-DTest" starts with UPPER CASE \'T\'. You can run a single test class, but not a single method within a test class.   You use the simple name of the class not the fully-qualified name of the class.   So, if you have a test in "org.sonatype.test.MyTest" and that is the only test you want to run, your command line would look like this:To my knowledge, the surefire plugin doesn\'t provide any way to do this. But feel free to open an issue :)
