This question already has an answer here:In Ruby, how do I skip a loop in a .each loop, similar to continue in other languages?Use next: prints:For additional coolness check out also redo and retry.Works also for friends like times, upto, downto, each_with_index, select, map and other iterators (and more generally blocks).For more info see http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_expressions.html#UL.next - it\'s like return, but for blocks! (So you can use this in any proc/lambda too.)That means you can also say next n to "return" n from the block.  For instance:This will yield 46.Note that return always returns from the closest def, and never a block; if there\'s no surrounding def, returning is an error.Using return from within a block intentionally can be confusing.  For instance:my_fun will result in "Hello.", not [1, "Hello.", 2], because the return keyword pertains to the outer def, not the inner block.
