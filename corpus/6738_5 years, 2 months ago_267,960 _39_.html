I have two projects, ProjectA and ProjectB.  ProjectB is a console application, which depends on ProjectA.  Yesterday, everything was working fine, but suddenly today when I run ProjectB I get this:BadImageFormatException was unhandled:\n  Could not load file or assembly \'ProjectA, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\' or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.Both are just regular projects, with no dependencies on any other non-.Net projects.  Both are fully .Net - there is no native code, and no P/Invoke.  I have other projects which depend on ProjectA and still work just fine.Things I have tried:But I still get the same error.  I have no idea what I did to cause this, nor how to fix it.  Any ideas?I am pretty sure you\'re having a 32-bit / 64-bit conflict. It sounds like your main project might be set to 32-bit while the class its referencing is set to 64-bit. Try looking at this SO question and this one too. Between the two of them, you should be able to figure out your problem.Might be you are facing the problem with your website after deploying on server.Then you need to adjust your application pool to Enable 32-Bit Applications.Steps:I just had this error message running IIS Express in Visual Studio 2015. In my case I needed to be running the 64 bit version of IIS Express:Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> Web Projects\n  Check the box\n  that says "Use the 64 bit version of IIS Express for web sites and\n  projects".Screenshot:I had this same problem. I had set Project A\'s "Platform Target" ("Project A"(Right Click)->Properties->Build->"Platform Target") to x86 but kept Project B\'s at "Any CPU". Setting Project B\'s to "x86" fixed this. You may need to change the Appication Pool setting "Enable 32bit Applications" to TRUE in IIS7 if you have at least 1 32bit dll\\exe in your project.I had this problem running unit tests (xunit) in Visual Studio 2015 and came across the following fix:I had the same issue with multiple projects in the same solution, i ended up setting all of the target frameworks to .NET Framework 4 and x86 for the target CPU and it finally successfully compiled.You might also see this issue if you\'re trying to package a 64bit project with an MSI installer in VS. ("The reason is because the native shim packaged with the .msi file is a 32-bit executable.")See here for more details: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/heaths/archive/2006/02/01/64-bit-managed-custom-actions-with-visual-studio.aspx I encountered the same issue.  It popped up out of the blue and that seemed strange to me.In the Exception snapshot, for the FusionLog, I saw the following within its message:... C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64 ...More about the fusion log: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e74a18c4(v=vs.110).aspxAll the projects had a Target CPU of AnyCPU.  I changed the application project (the project that references all the other projects) to a Target CPU of x86.  It now works.Not sure how the Target CPU mix up occurred for no apparent reason, but it did.I also face this problem in a project, after a few minutes i found the solution, \nthis problem is due to CPU configuration,\nIf you are using Visual Studio 2010 or VS 2013, just goto project \'s properties and then select Compile from side bar and there will be 5 drop-down, 5th Drop-down will be Target CPU:, you should set it to x86 or x64 according to your requirements instead of Any CPU. My problem was solved after changing it to x86. This also can happen just by having multiple supported frameworks defined in the app.config file and, forcing the app to run in a different .NET framework other than the one mentioned first in the app.config file.And also this fires when you have both of the mentioned frameworks available in your system.As a workaround, bring up the target framework you are going to use for the debugging up in the app.configex: if you trying to run in .NET 4, config file should have something similar to this,In my project for C#, project property->[Build]->Platform target: Any CPU,\nand uncheck the Prefer 32-bit to let compiler to choose automatically.None of these solutions worked for me - but by deleting the contents of bin and obj folders everything was cool again.I got this when building a project via Visual Studio Online (VSTS) Build using Visual Studio Build Steps.The solution was:It can be a little funny, but I had the same problem with normal working code. I added StreamWriter and StreamReader and it gave that error.\nThe solution was I took that code into comment brackets then did debug and it started to work againMy machine showed me a BIOS update and I wondered if that has something to do with the sudden popping-up of this error. And after I did the update, the error was resolved and the solution built fine.
