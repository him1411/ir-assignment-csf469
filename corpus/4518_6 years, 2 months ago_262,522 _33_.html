Is there a way to find all Python PyPI packages that were installed with easy_install or pip?  I mean, excluding everything that was/is installed with the distributions tools (in this case apt-get on Debian).pip freeze will output a list of installed packages and their versions. It also allows you to write those packages to a file that can later be used to set up a new environment.http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html#freezing-requirementsAs of version 1.3 of pip you can now use pip listIt has some useful options including the ability to show outdated packages. Here\'s the documentation: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_list/If anyone is wondering you can use the \'pip show\' command.This will list the install directory of the given package.If Debian behaves like recent Ubuntu versions regarding pip install default target, it\'s dead easy: it installs to /usr/local/lib/ instead of /usr/lib (apt default target). Check https://askubuntu.com/questions/173323/how-do-i-detect-and-remove-python-packages-installed-via-pip/259747#259747I am an ArchLinux user and as I experimented with pip I met this same problem. Here\'s how I solved it in Arch.Key here is /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages, which is the directory pip installs to, YMMV. pacman -Qo is how Arch\'s pac kage man ager checks for ownership of the file. No package is part of the return it gives when no package owns the file: error: No package owns $FILENAME. Tricky workaround: I\'m querying about __init__.py because pacman -Qo is a little bit ignorant when it comes to directories :(In order to do it for other distros, you have to find out where pip installs stuff (just sudo pip install something), how to query ownership of a file (Debian/Ubuntu method is dpkg -S) and what is the "no package owns that path" return (Debian/Ubuntu is no path found matching pattern). Debian/Ubuntu users, beware: dpkg -S will fail if you give it a symbolic link. Just resolve it first by using realpath. Like this:Fedora users can try (thanks @eddygeek):pip.get_installed_distributions() will give a list of installed packagesThe below is a little slow, but it gives a nicely formatted list of packages that pip is aware of.  That is to say, not all of them were installed "by" pip, but all of them should be able to be upgraded by pip.The reason it is slow is that it lists the contents of the entire pypi repo.  I filed a ticket suggesting pip list provide similar functionality but more efficiently. Sample output: (restricted the search to a subset instead of \'.\' for all.)Start with:To list all packages. Once you found the package you want, use:This will show you details about this package, including its folder. You can skip the first part if you already know the package nameClick here for more information on pip show and here for more information on pip list.Example:Take note that if you have multiple versions of Python installed on your computer, you may have a few versions of pip associated with each. Depending on your associations, you might need to be very cautious of what pip command you use: Worked for me, where I\'m running Python3.4. Simply using pip list returned the error The program \'pip\' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: sudo apt-get install python-pip. Here is the one-liner for fedora or other rpm distros (based on @barraponto tips):Append this to the previous command to get cleaner output:Newer versions of pip have the ability to do what the OP wants via \n    pip list -l or pip freeze -l.\nOn Debian (at least) the man page doesn\'t make this clear, and I only discovered it - under the assumption that the feature must exist - with pip list --help.  There are recent comments that suggest this feature is not obvious in either the documentation or the existing answers (although hinted at by some), so I thought I should post. I would have preferred to do so as a comment, but I don\'t have the reputation points. Get all file/folder names in site-packages/ (and dist-packages/ if it exists), and use your package manager to strip the ones that were installed via package.pip freeze lists all installed packages even if not by pip/easy_install.\nOn CentOs/Redhat a package installed through rpm is found.Adding to @Paul Woolcock\'s answer,will create a requirements file with all installed packages in the  active environment at the current location which you can runto install the requirements at another environment.
