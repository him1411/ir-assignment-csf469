I\'m trying to learn about Docker, but I keep getting cryptic (to me) error messages.Possibly the simplest example of this is trying to print the version of Docker I installed:I\'ve just been going through the user guide and following every step exactly, so I\'m surprised that I get this message... What should I do now?I just noticed that if I don\'t use sudo I don\'t get the error:Of course, this is not a solution as I may need to use sudo somewhere down the road...I just found another page saying "If you\'re using OS X then you shouldn\'t use sudo." I don\'t know if they mean only for that example, or in general.For me, running $(boot2docker shellinit 2> /dev/null) fixed the problem.This runs the output of the boot2docker shellinit command (the three set -x ... lines) in your current terminal session, which lets the docker command know where to find the boot2docker virtual machine.Adding $(boot2docker shellinit 2> /dev/null) to the bottom of your ~/.bash_profile file will make sure the docker command is configured, every time you open your terminal.For people using Fish shell: boot2docker shellinit ^ /dev/null | source.Note that 2> /dev/null (and the Fish equivalent ^ /dev/null) are optional. Like @pablo-fernandez suggested, this hides the Writing .. lines.I was getting the same error on MacOS with sudo and without it.I have solved it with:P.S.: Thanks to Alan. I found out that this approach is recommended in their official documentation.P.S.2: Sometimes boot2docker init can be required before running two commands (thank you Aaron).In my case (Linux Mint 17) I did various things, and I\'m not sure about which of them are totally necessary.I included missing Ubuntu packages:A user was added to group docker:Started daemon (openSUSE just needs this)Thanks Usman Ismail, because maybe it was just that last thing...Stupid question but have you started the docker daemon? \xe2\x80\x93  Usman Ismail Dec 17 \'14 at 15:04Thanks also to github@MichaelJCole for the solution that worked for me, because I didn\'t check for the daemon when I read Usman\'s comment.GitHub comment:Thanks to fredjean.net post for noticing the missing packages and forget about the default Ubuntu installation instructions and google about other waysIt turns out that the cgroup-lite and the lxc packages are not installed by default on Linux Mint. Installing both then allowed me to run bash in the base image and then build and run my image.Thanks to brettof86\'s comment about openSUSEThe underlining problem is simple \xe2\x80\x93 lack of permission to /var/run/docker.sock unix domain socket.From Daemon socket option chapter of Docker Command Line reference for Docker 1.6.0: By default, a unix domain socket (or IPC socket) is created at\n  /var/run/docker.sock, requiring either root permission, or docker\n  group membership.Steps necessary to grant rights to users are nicely described in Docker installation instructions for Fedora:Granting rights to users to use Docker  The docker command line tool\n  contacts the docker daemon process via a socket file\n  /var/run/docker.sock owned by root:root. Though it\'s recommended to\n  use sudo for docker commands, if users wish to avoid it, an\n  administrator can create a docker group, have it own\n  /var/run/docker.sock, and add users to this group.$ sudo groupadd docker\n  $ sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock\n  $ sudo usermod -a -G docker $USERNAME Log out and log back in for above changes to take effect.\nPlease note that Docker packages of some Linux distributions (Ubuntu) do already place /var/run/docker.sock in the docker group making the first two of above steps unnecessary.In case of OS X and boot2docker the situation is different; the Docker daemon runs inside a VM so the DOCKER_HOST environment variable must be set to this VM so that the Docker client could find the Docker daemon. This is done by running $(boot2docker shellinit) in the shell.Make sure the Docker daemon is running:That fixed it for me!You will need to do:The following settings fixed the issue:Visit Docker documentation page Protect the Docker daemon socket.Scroll a little to the top and find warning section for clarity.It is possible that you do not have the permission to the file yet.\nIt happened to me after I add myself to dockergroup using but not yet logout.To resolve this, you can either re-login, or use\nsg docker "docker <subcommand> ..." before you logout.If you are in group docker  in /etc/group, you should be able to run it without typing password.https://dingyichen.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/docker-dial-unix-varrundocker-sock-no-such-file-or-directory-are-you-trying-to-connect-to-a-tls-enabled-daemon-without-tls/On Ubuntu after installing lxc-docker you need to add your user to the docker user group:This is because of the socket file permissions:DO NOT RUN usermod WITHOUT "-a" as suggested in one of the other comments or it will wipe your additional groups setting and will just leave the "docker" groupThis is what will happen:TLDR: This got my Python meetup group past this problem when I was running a clinic on installing docker and most of the users were on OS X:run the export commands the output gives you, thenshould tell you it works.The Context (what brought us to the problem)I led a clinic on installing docker and most attendees had OS X, and we ran into this problem and I overcame it on several machines. Here\'s the steps we followed:First, we installed homebrew (yes, some attendees didn\'t have it):Then we got cask, which we used to install virtualbox, and then used brew to install docker and boot2docker (all required for OS X) Don\'t use sudo for brew.:The SolutionThat was when we ran into the problem the asker here got. The following fixed it. I understand init was a one-time deal, but you\'ll probably have to run up every time you start docker:Then when up has been run, it gives several export commands. Copy-paste and run those.Finally docker info should tell you it\'s properly installed. To DemoThe rest of the commands should demo it. (on Ubuntu linux I required sudo.)Then you should be on a root shell in the container:Back to your native user bash:Look for the about 12 digit hexadecimal (0-9 or a-f) identifier under "Container ID", e.g. 456789abcdef. You can then commit your change and name it some descriptive name, like descriptivename:Everything that you need to run Docker on Linux Ubuntu/Mint:Optionally, you may need to install two additional dependencies if the above doesn\'t work:I tried the solutions here, and boot2docker didn\'t work.My solution: Uninstall boot2docker on the Mac, install a CentosÂ 7 VM in VirtualBox, and work with Docker inside that VM.For what it is worth, I tried all the solutions in this question and in this related question and none resolved my issue until I uninstalled and re-installed VirtualBox. This process upgraded the VirtualBox from version 4.2.16 to 4.3.22 (my previous one had been lying unused on the system for a few months).Then boot2docker and docker worked without any other adjustments.I had the same problem. A simple service docker restart solved the problem.For me the following steps worked:After that, hello-world started to work.My answer is based on How can I use docker without sudo? which explains what go wrong.I had the same issue and tried various things to fix this, amending the .bash_profile file, logging in and out, without any luck. In the end, restarting my machine fixed it.Make sure there isin your file.I faced the same issue when I was creating Docker images from Jenkins. Simply add the user to the docker group and then restart Docker services and in my case I had to restart Jenkins services.This was the error which I got:Another possible reason is that your BIOS CPU visualization is not enabled. Go and enable it first!
