The line is this one: Does it means that the gem needs to be installed or is not required? This means install the gem, but do not call require when you start Bundler.  So you will need to manually callif you want to use the library.If you were to dothen bundler would download the gem named whenever, but would callThis is often used if the name of library to require is different than the name of the gem.You use :require => false when you want the gem to be installed but not "required". So in the example you gave:\n gem \'whenever\', :require => false \nwhen someone runs bundle install the whenever gem would be installed as with gem install whenever.  Whenever is used to create cron jobs by running a rake task but isn\'t usually used from within the rails (or other framework if not rails) application.So you can use :require => false for anything that you need to run from the command line but don\'t need within your code.require: false tells Bundler.require not to require that specific gem: the gem must be required explicitly via require \'gem\'.This option does not affect:bundle install: the gem will get installed regardlessthe require search path setup by bundler.Bundler adds things to the path when you do either of:Gemfilemain.rbThen the following won\'t raise exceptions:On GitHub for you to play with it.As explained in the initialization tutorial, the default Rails template runs on startup:config/boot.rb contains:which does the require \'bundler/setup\' and sets up the require path.config/application.rb does:which actually requires the gems.Whenever you specify a Gem in your Gemfile and run bundle install, bundler will go and install specified gem and load code for that Gem in you app by putting  require \'whenever\' ,this way bundler will load code for all of your Gems in your Rails app, and you can call any method from any Gem without any pain,like you do most of the time.but Gems like whenever,faker or capistrano  are something which you do not need in your app code you need whenever code in your schedule.rb  file to manage crons and capistrano code in deploy.rb  file to customize deployment recipe so you need not to load code for these gems in your app code \nand wherever you want to call any method from these Gems you can manually require thsese gems by yourself by putting  require "whenever" . so you put :require => false in your Gemfile for these Gems, this way bundler will install that Gem but not load code for that Gem itself, you can do it whenever you want by simply putting like require \'whenever\' in your case.
