Like most Python developers, I typically keep a console window open with the Python interpreter running to test commands, dir() stuff, help() stuff, etc.Like any console, after a while the visible backlog of past commands and prints gets to be cluttered, and sometimes confusing when re-running the same command several times.  I\'m wondering if, and how, to clear the Python interpreter console.I\'ve heard about doing a system call and either calling cls on Windows or clear on Linux, but I was hoping there was something I could command the interpreter itself to do.Note: I\'m running on Windows, so Ctrl+L doesn\'t work.As you mentioned, you can do a system call:I am not sure of any other way in Windows.here something handy that is a little more cross-platformWell, here\'s a quick hack:Or to save some typing, put this file in your python search path:Then you can do this from the interpreter all you like :)Although this is an older question, I thought I\'d contribute something summing up what I think were the best of the other answers and add a wrinkle of my own by suggesting that you put these command(s) into a file and set your PYTHONSTARTUP environment variable to point to it. Since I\'m on Windows at the moment, it\'s slightly biased that way, but could easily be slanted some other direction.Here\'s some articles I found that describe how to set environment variables on Windows:\n        When to use sys.path.append and when modifying %PYTHONPATH% is enough\n        How To Manage Environment Variables in Windows XP\n        Configuring System and User Environment Variables\n        How to Use Global System Environment Variables in WindowsBTW, don\'t put quotes around the path to the file even if it has spaces in it.Anyway, here\'s my take on the code to put in (or add to your existing) Python startup script:BTW, you can also use @Triptych\'s __repr__ trick to change exit() into just exit (and ditto for its alias quit):Lastly, here\'s something else that changes the primary interpreter prompt from >>> to cwd+>>>:Quickest and easiest way without a doubt is Ctrl+L.This is the same for OS X on the terminal. You have number of ways doing it on Windows:my way of doing this is to write a function like so:then call clear() to clear the screen.\nthis works on windows, osx, linux, bsd... all OSes.Wiper is cool, good thing about it is I don\'t have to type \'()\' around it.\nHere is slight variation to itThe usage is quite simple:Here\'s the definitive solution that merges all other answers. Features:You can use it as you like:You can import it as a module:You can call it as a script:It is truly multiplatform; if it can\'t recognize your system\n(ce, nt, dos or posix) it will fall back to printing blank lines.You can download the [full] file here: https://gist.github.com/3130325\nOr if you are just looking for the code:Use idle. It has many handy features.  Ctrl+F6, for example, resets the console.  Closing and opening the console are good ways to clear it.I use iTerm and the native terminal app for Mac OS.I just press \xe2\x8c\x98 + kI\'m using MINGW/BASH on Windows XP, SP3.(stick this in .pythonstartup)\n # My ctrl-l already kind of worked, but this might help someone else\n # leaves prompt at bottom of the window though...\nimport readline\nreadline.parse_and_bind(\'\\C-l: clear-screen\')  # This works in BASH because I have it in .inputrc as well, but for some\n # reason it gets dropped when I go into Python\nreadline.parse_and_bind(\'\\C-y: kill-whole-line\')  I couldn\'t stand typing \'exit()\' anymore and was delighted with martineau\'s/Triptych\'s tricks:I slightly doctored it though (stuck it in .pythonstartup)  How about this for a clearThat is about as short as could be!The OS command clear in Linux and cls in Windows outputs a "magic string" which you can just print.  To get the string, execute the command with popen and save it in a variable for later use:On my machine the string is \'\\x1b[H\\x1b[2J\'.I\'m new to python (really really new) and in one of the books I\'m reading to get acquainted with the language they teach how to create this little function to clear the console of the visible backlog and past commands and prints:Open shell / Create new document / Create function as follows:Save it inside the lib folder in you python directory (mine is C:\\Python33\\Lib)\nNext time you nedd to clear your console just call the function with:that\'s it.\nPS: you can name you function anyway you want. Iv\' seen people using "wiper" "wipe" and variations.I found the simplest way is just to close the window and run a module/script to reopen the shell.just use this..print \'\\n\'*1000I\'m not sure if Windows\' "shell" supports this, but on Linux:print "\\033[2J"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#CSI_codesIn my opinion calling cls with os is a bad idea generally. Imagine if I manage to change the cls or clear command on your system, and you run your script as admin or root.I might be late to the part but here is a very easy way to do itType:So what ever you want to clear the screen just type in your codeBest way possible!

In python just type exit() when you want to exit.This should be cross platform, and also uses the preferred subprocess.call instead of os.system as per the os.system docs. Should work in Python >= 2.4.OK, so this is a much less technical answer, but I\'m using the Python plugin for Notepad++ and it turns out you can just clear the console manually by right-clicking on it and clicking "clear". Hope this helps someone out there!Magic strings are mentioned above - I believe they come from the terminfo database:http://www.google.com/?q=x#q=terminfohttp://www.google.com/?q=x#q=tput+command+in+unix$ tput clear| od -t x1z\n0000000 1b 5b 48 1b 5b 32 4a                             >.[H.[2J<\n0000007I am using Spyder (Python 2.7) and to clean the interpreter console I use either %clear  that forces the command line to go to the top and I will not see the previous old commands.or I click "option" on the Console environment and select "Restart kernel" that removes everything.Here are two nice ways of doing that:1. 2.UPDATE: 80x25 is unlikely to be the size of console windows, so to get the real console dimensions, use functions from pager module. Python doesn\'t provide anything similar from core distribution.If its on mac a simple cmd + k does the trickAt the prompt type in "cls" and hit enter. In Spyder, when you want to clear all the variables in you Variable explorer, simply type global().clear() in the Console, and they will all be gone.https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/releasesThere is a tool you can install for Windows and then use the following print: print "\\x1b[2J"See link for tool below:
