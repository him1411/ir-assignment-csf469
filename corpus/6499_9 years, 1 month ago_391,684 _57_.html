Is there a free or open source library to read Excel files (.xls) directly from a C# program? It does not need to be too fancy, just to select a worksheet and read the data as strings. So far, I\'ve been using Export to Unicode text function of Excel, and parsing the resulting (tab-delimited) file, but I\'d like to eliminate the manual step.This is what I usually use.  It is a little different because I usually stick a AsEnumerable() at the edit of the tables: as this lets me use LINQ to search and build structs from the fields.If it is just simple data contained in the Excel file you can read the data via ADO.NET. See the connection strings listed here:http://www.connectionstrings.com/?carrier=excel2007\nor \nhttp://www.connectionstrings.com/?carrier=excel-RyanUpdate: then you can just read the worksheet via something like select * from [Sheet1$]The ADO.NET approach is quick and easy, but it has a few quirks which you should be aware of, especially regarding how DataTypes are handled.This excellent article will help you avoid some common pitfalls:\nhttp://blog.lab49.com/archives/196This is what I used for Excel 2003:How about Excel Data Reader? http://exceldatareader.codeplex.com/I\'ve used in it anger, in a production environment, to pull large amounts of data from a variety of Excel files into SQL Server Compact.

Not sure if this would be exactly what you need (and may not be my best code :)).Koogra is an open-source component written in C# that reads and writes Excel files.While you did specifically ask for .xls, implying the older file formats, for the OpenXML formats (e.g. xlsx) I highly recommend the OpenXML SDK (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb448854.aspx)I did a lot of reading from Excel files in C# a while ago, and we used two approaches:The latter approach was much faster: reading a big table with 20 columns and 200 lines would take 30 seconds via COM, and half a second via ODBC. So I would recommend the database approach if all you need is the data.Cheers,CarlExcelMapper is an open source tool (http://code.google.com/p/excelmapper/) that can be used to read Excel worksheets as Strongly Typed Objects. It supports both xls and xlsx formats.I want to show a simple method to read xls/xlsx file with .NET.

(there has been an API for a long while but was nasty COM) You can do everything you want / need in code all while the Office app remains a hidden background process.Forgive me if I am off-base here, but isn\'t this what the Office PIA\'s are for?Lately, partly to get better at LINQ.... I\'ve been using Excel\'s automation API to save the file as XML Spreadsheet and then get process that file using LINQ to XML.

I used it on a small project, and the API is straightforward. Works with XLSX only (Excel 200&), not with XLS.The source code also seems well-organized and easy to get around (if you need to expand functionality or fix minor issues as I did).At first, I tried the ADO.Net (Excel connection string) approach, but it was fraught with nasty hacks -- for instance if second row contains a number, it will return ints for all fields in the column below and quietly drop any data that doesn\'t fit.We use ClosedXML in rather large systems.Take.io Spreadsheet will do this work for you, and at no charge.
