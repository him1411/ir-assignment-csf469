I have a dialog with EditText for input. When I click the "yes" button on dialog, it will validate the input and then close the dialog. However, if the input is wrong, I want to remain in the same dialog. Every time no matter what the input is, the dialog should be automatically closed when I click on the "no" button. How can I disable this? By the way, I have used PositiveButton and NegativeButton for the button on dialog. EDIT: This only works on API 8+ as noted by some of the comments.\nThis is a late answer, but you can add an onShowListener to the AlertDialog where you can then override the onClickListener of the button.Here are some solutions for all types of dialogs including a solution for AlertDialog.Builder that will work on all API levels (works below API 8, which the other answer here does not). There are solutions for AlertDialogs using AlertDialog.Builder, DialogFragment, and DialogPreference.Below are the code examples showing how to override the default common button handler and prevent the dialog from closing for these different forms of dialogs. All the examples show how to prevent the positive button from closing the dialog.Note: A description of how the dialog closing works under the hood for the base android classes and why the following approaches are chosen follows after the examples, for those who want more detailsExplanation of approaches:Looking through Android source code the AlertDialog default implementation works by registering a common button handler to all the actual buttons in OnCreate(). When a button is clicked the common button handler forwards the click event to whatever handler you passed in setButton() then calls dismisses the dialog. If you wish to prevent a dialog box from closing when one of these buttons is pressed you must replace the common button handler for the actual view of the button. Because it is assigned in OnCreate(), you must replace it after the default OnCreate() implementation is called. OnCreate is called in the process of the show() method. You could create a custom Dialog class and override OnCreate() to call the super.OnCreate() then override the button handlers, but if you make a custom dialog you don\'t get the Builder for free, in which case what is the point?So, in using a dialog the way it is designed but with controlling when it is dismissed, one approach is to call dialog.Show() first, then obtain a reference to the button using dialog.getButton() to override the click handler. Another approach is to use setOnShowListener() and implement finding the button view and replacing the handler in the OnShowListener. The functional difference between the two is \'almost\' nill, depending on what thread originally creates the dialog instance. Looking through the source code, the onShowListener gets called by a message posted to a handler running on the thread that created that dialog. So, since your OnShowListener is called by a message posted on the message queue it is technically possible that calling your listener is delayed some time after show completes. Therefore, I believe the safest approach is the first: to call show.Dialog(), then immediately in the same execution path replace the button handlers. Since your code that calls show() will be operating on the main GUI thread, it means whatever code you follow show() with will be executed before any other code on that thread, whereas the timing of the OnShowListener method is at the mercy of the message queue.I\'ve written a simple class (an AlertDialogBuilder) that you can use to disable the auto-dismiss feature when pressing the dialog\'s buttons.It is compatible also with Android 1.6, so it doesn\'t make use of the OnShowListener (which is available only API >= 8).So, instead of using AlertDialog.Builder you can use this CustomAlertDialogBuilder.\nThe most important part is that you should not call create(), but only the show() method. I\'ve added methods like setCanceledOnTouchOutside() and setOnDismissListener so that you can still set them directly on the builder.I tested it on Android 1.6, 2.x, 3.x and 4.x so it should work pretty well.\nIf you find some problems please comment here.EDIT Here is a small example on how to use the CustomAlertDialogBuilder:Cheers,YuviHere\'s something if you are using DialogFragment - which is the recommended way to handle Dialogs anyway.What happens with AlertDialog\'s setButton() method (and I imagine the same with AlertDialogBuilder\'s setPositiveButton() and setNegativeButton()) is that the button you set (e.g. AlertDialog.BUTTON_POSITIVE) with it will actually trigger TWO different OnClickListener objects when pressed. The first being DialogInterface.OnClickListener, which is a parameter to setButton(), setPositiveButton(), and setNegativeButton(). The other is View.OnClickListener, which will be set to automatically dismiss your AlertDialog when any of its button is pressed - and is set by AlertDialog itself. What you can do is to use setButton() with null as the DialogInterface.OnClickListener, to create the button, and then call your custom action method inside View.OnClickListener. For example, Then, you may override the default AlertDialog\'s buttons\' View.OnClickListener (which would otherwise dismiss the dialog) in the DialogFragment\'s onResume() method:You will need to set this in the onResume() method because getButton() will return null until after the dialog has been shown!This should cause your custom action method to only be called once, and the dialog won\'t be dismissed by default.Inspired by Tom\'s answer, I believe the idea here is:  You can override the onShowListener like Tom. Alternatively, you canCode:\nFor pre API 8 i solved the problem using a boolean flag, a dismiss listener and calling dialog.show again if in case the content of the editText wasn\xc2\xb4t correct. Like this:I would like to present an alternate answer from a UX perspective. Why would you want to prevent a dialog from closing when a button is clicked? Presumably it is because you have a custom dialog in which the user hasn\'t made a choice or hasn\'t completely filled everything out yet. And if they are not finished, then you shouldn\'t allow them to click the positive button at all. Just disable it until everything is ready. The other answers here give lots of tricks for overriding the positive button click. If that were important to do, wouldn\'t Android have made a convenient method to do it? They didn\'t.Instead, the Dialogs design guide shows an example of such a situation. The OK button is disabled until the user makes a choice. No overriding tricks are necessary at all. It is obvious to the user that something still needs to be done before going on.See the Android documentation for creating a custom dialog layout. It recommends that you place your AlertDialog inside a DialogFragment. Then all you need to do is set listeners on the layout elements to know when to enable or disable the positive button.The positive button can be disabled like this:Here is an entire working DialogFragment with a disabled positive button such as might be used in the image above.The custom dialog can be run from an activity like this:NotesThe button is still null in onCreateDialog so I disabled it in onResume. This has the undesireable effect of disabling the it again if the user switches to another app and then comes back without dismissing the dialog. This could be solved by also unselecting any user choices or by calling a Runnable from onCreateDialog to disable the button on the next run loop.The answer at this link is a simple solution, and which is compatible right back to API 3. It is very  similiar to Tom Bollwitt\'s solution, but without using the less compatible OnShowListener.Yes, you can. You basically need to:I made minor adaptions to Kamen\'s code since I was extending an EditTextPreference.Such fun!This code will work for you, because i had a simmilar problem and this worked for me. :)1- Override Onstart() method in your fragment-dialog class.To prevent the dialog from being dismissed automatically you have to set the OnClickListener after the ProgressDialog is shown, like so:This is probably very late reply, but using setCancelable will do the trick.you can add builder.show(); after validation message before return;like this If you are using material design I would suggest checking out material-dialogs.  It fixed several issues for me related to currently open Android bugs (see 78088), but most importantly for this ticket it has an autoDismiss flag that can be set when using the Builder.It could be built with easiest way:Alert Dialog with Custom View and with two Buttons (Positive & Negative).CustomClickLister of Positive Button of Alert Dailog:DoneMy solution is simple, just use a custom layout for your DialogFragment and add a LinearLayout under your content which can be styled as borderless to match Google Material Design, then find the newly created Buttons and Override their OnClickListener: DialogFragment.java code:dialog_add_topic.xmlThis is the final result:
