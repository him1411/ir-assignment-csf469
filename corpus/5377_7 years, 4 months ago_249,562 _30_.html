I need to enable pdo_mysql in my EasyPhp environment, so I went to php.ini file and uncommented the following line:Unfortunately I still have the same problem.\nI\'m using the CLI so I suppose I need to locate the php.ini file used by the CLI. How can I find it?Just run php --iniYou can get a full phpinfo() using :And, in there, there is the php.ini file used :On Windows use find instead:will give you all the details details on the uses path and possible ini file(s)You can use get_cfg_var(\'cfg_file_path\') for that:\nAnd you can simply set the location of the php.ini. You\'re using the command line version, so using the -c parameter you can specifiy the location, e.g.Run php --ini in your terminal, you\'ll get all details about ini filesFor more, use helping command php --help It\'ll display all the possible options. Somtimes things aren\'t always as they seem when in comes to config files in general. So here I\'m applying my usual methods for exploring what files are opened by a process.I use a very powerful and useful command-line program called strace to show me what\'s really going on behind my back!Strace digs out kernel (system) calls that your program makes and dumps the output into the file specified by -oIt\'s easy to use grep to search for occurrences of php.ini in this log. It\'s pretty obvious looking at the following typical response to see what is going on.If you want all the configuration files loaded, this is will tell you:Some systems load things from more than one ini file. On my ubuntu system, it looks like this:If you need to pass it to another app, you can do something like:returns the path only. php -c $(php --ini | grep Loaded | cut -d" " -f12) will pass in the config file (useful for fpm)On OSX Mavericks, running:Returned:In the /etc/ directory was:(as well as php-fpm.conf.default)I was able to copy php.ini.default to php.ini, add date.timezone = "US/Central" to the top (right below [php]), and the problem is solved. (At least the error message is gone.)From what I remember when I used to use EasyPHP, the php.ini file is either in C:\\Windows\\ or C:\\Windows\\System32In your php.ini file set your extension directory, e.g:You will see in you PHP folder there is an ext folder with all the dll\'s and extensions.There is no php.ini used by the command line. You have to copy the file from ...EasyPHP-<<version>>\\apache\\php.ini  to ...EasyPHP-<<version>>\\php\\php.ini than edit the one in php directoryReference:
