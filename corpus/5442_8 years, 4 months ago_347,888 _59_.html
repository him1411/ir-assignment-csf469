I need to check a JavaScript array to see if there are any duplicate values. What\'s the easiest way to do this? I just need to find what the duplicated values are - I don\'t actually need their indexes or how many times they are duplicated.I know I can loop through the array and check all the other values for a match, but it seems like there should be an easier way. Any ideas? Thanks!You could sort the array and then run through it and then see if the next (or previous) index is the same as the current. Assuming your sort algorithm is good, this should be less than O(n2):If you want to elimate the duplicates, try this great solution:Its one of the greatest code snippets for JavaScript i\'ve seen. The original is published here:\nhttp://dreaminginjavascript.wordpress.com/2008/08/22/eliminating-duplicates/This is my answer from the duplicate thread (!):Got tired of seeing all bad examples with for-loops or jQuery. Javascript has the perfect tools for this nowadays: sort, map and reduce. @Dmytro-Laptin pointed out some code code be removed. This is a more compact version of the same code. Using some ES6 tricks and higher order functions:You can add this function, or tweak it and add it to Javascript\'s Array prototype:  UPDATED: The following uses an optimized combined strategy. It optimizes primitive lookups to benefit from hash O(1) lookup time (running unique on an array of primitives is O(n)). Object lookups are optimized by tagging objects with a unique id while iterating through so so identifying duplicate objects is also O(1) per item and O(n) for the whole list. The only exception is items that are frozen, but those are rare and a fallback is provided using an array and indexOf.If you have ES6 Collections available, then there is a much simpler and significantly faster version. (shim for IE9+ and other browsers here: https://github.com/Benvie/ES6-Harmony-Collections-Shim)This should get you what you want, Just the duplicates.using underscore.jsThis should be one of the shortest ways to actually find duplicate values in an array. As specifically asked for by the OP, this does not remove duplicates but finds them.This doesn\'t need sorting or any third party framework. It also doesn\'t need manual loops. It works with every value indexOf() (or to be clearer: the strict comparision operator) supports.Because of reduce() and indexOf() it needs at least IE 9.or when added to the prototyp.chain of ArraySee here: https://gist.github.com/1305056instead of adding the \'Array.prototype.indexOf\'When all you need is to check that there are no duplicates as asked in this question you can use the every() method:Note that every() doesn\'t work for IE 8 and below.I use lastIndexOf() because it might be more efficient than indexOf() if function callbacks made by every() are made in the index order, but that\'s not proven.In CoffeeScript I\'m using this:The following function (a variation of the eliminateDuplicates function already mentioned) seems to do the trick, returning test2,1,7,5 for the input ["test", "test2", "test2", 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 10, 22, 43, 1, 5, 8]Note that the problem is stranger in JavaScript than in most other languages, because a JavaScript array can hold just about anything. Note that solutions that use sorting might need to provide an appropriate sorting function--I haven\'t tried that route yet.This particular implementation works for (at least) strings and numbers.Here is a very light and easy way:ES5 only (i.e., it needs a filter() polyfill for IE8 and below):Modifying @RaphaelMontanaro\'s solution, borrowing from @Nosredna\'s blog, here is what you could do if you just want to identify the duplicate elements from your array.Thanks for the elegant solution, @Nosredna!I did not like most answers. Why? Too complicated, too much code, inefficient code and many do not answer the question, which is to find the duplicates (and not to give an array without the duplicates). Next function returns all duplicates:Because most of the time it is of no use to return ALL duplicates, but just to tell which duplicate values exist. In that case you return an array with unique duplicates ;-)Maybe somebody else thinks the same.To solve the above in O(n) time complexity (without sorting).This is probably one of the fastest way to remove permanently the duplicates from an array\n10x times faster than the most functions here.& 78x faster in safariif you can\'t read the code above ask, read a javascript book or here are some explainations about shorter code. https://stackoverflow.com/a/21353032/2450730EDIT\nAs stated in the comments this function does return an array with uniques, the question however asks to find the duplicates. in that case a simple modification to this function allows to push the duplicates into an array, then using the previous function toUnique removes the duplicates of the duplicates. Using "includes" to test if the element already exists.ES6 offers the Set data structure which is basically an array that doesn\'t accept duplicates.\nWith the Set data structure, there\'s a very easy way to find duplicates in an array (using only one loop).Here\'s my codeI feel like the simplest solution would to just use indexOffull example of pushing only unique elements to an array.The Prototype library has a uniq function, which returns the array without the dupes. That\'s only half of the work though. Just to add some theory to the above. Finding duplicates has a lower bound of O(n*log(n) in the comparison model.  SO theoretically, you cannot do any better than first sorting then going through the\nlist sequentially removing any duplicates you find.If you want to find the duplicates in linear (O(n))  expected time, you could\nhash each element of the list; if there is a collision, remove/label it as a duplicate,\nand continue.Yet another way by using underscore. Numbers is the source array and dupes has possible duplicate values.I think the below is the easiest and fastest O(n) way to accomplish exactly what you asked:Or for ES5 or greater:I prefer the function way of doing this.This uses underscore, but Array has a reduce function, too Similar to a few other answers, but I used forEach() to make it a bit prettier:If a value is duplicated more than once, all its duplicates are returned, like so:This might be what you want, otherwise you just have to follow with an "unique" filtering.
