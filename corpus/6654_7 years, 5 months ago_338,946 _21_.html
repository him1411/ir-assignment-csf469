I want to access a URL which requires a username/password. I\'d like to try accessing it with curl. Right now I\'m doing something like:I get an error. I guess I need to specify a username and password along with the above command.How can I do that?Use the -u flag to include a username, and curl will prompt for a password:You can also include the password in the command, but then your password will be visible in bash history:It is safer to do:...as passing plain user/password string on the command line is a bad idea.The format of the password file is (as per man curl):(The words \'machine\', \'login\', and \'password\' are just keywords; the actual information is the stuff after those keywords).Or the same thing but different syntaxYou can also just send the user name by writing:Curl will then ask you for the password, and the password will not be visible on the screen (or if you need to copy/paste the command).Plain and simply put the most secure way would be to use environment variables to store/retrieve your credentials. Thus a curl command like:Would then call your restful api and pass the http WWW_Authentication header with the Base64 encoded values of API_USER and API_HASH. The -Lk just tells curl to follow http 30x redirects and to use insecure tls handling (ie ignore ssl errors). While the double -- is just bash syntax sugar to stop processing command line flags. Furthermore, the -b cookies.txt and -c cookies.txt flags handle cookies with -b sending cookies and -c storing cookies locally.The manual has more examples of authentication methods.To let the password least not pop up in your .bash_history:To securely pass the password in a script (i.e. prevent it from showing up with ps auxf or logs) you can do it with the -K- flag (read config from stdin) and a heredoc:If you are on a system that has Gnome keyring app a solution that avoids exposing the password directly  is to use gkeyring.py to extract the password from the keyring:You can use command like,Then HTTP password will be triggered.Reference:\nhttp://www.asempt.com/article/how-use-curl-http-password-protected-site
