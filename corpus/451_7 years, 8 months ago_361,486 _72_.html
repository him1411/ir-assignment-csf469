I wrongly named a column hased_password instead of hashed_password.How do I update the database schema, using migration to rename this column?Update:You\'ll probably want to create a separate migration to do this. (Rename FixColumnName as you will)Then edit the migration to do your will.An update for Rails 3.1While, the up and down methods still apply. Rails 3.1 receives a change method that "knows how to migrate your database and reverse it when the migration is rolled back without the need to write a separate down method"If you happen to have a whole bunch of columns to rename, or something that would have required repeating the table name over and over again.You could use change_table to keep things a little neater.Thank you, Luke && Turadg, for bringing up the topic.Then just db:migrate as usual or however you go about your business.An update for Rails 4While creating a Migration as for renaming a column, Rails 4 generates a change method instead of up and down as mentioned in the above answer. The generated change method is as below : which will create a migration file similar to this :IMO, in this case, better use rake db:rollback. Then edit your migration and again type rake db:migrate. However, if you have data in the column you don\'t want to lose, then use rename_column.http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.htmlUnder Available Transformationsrename_column(table_name, column_name, new_column_name):Renames a column but keeps the type and content.If the column is already populated with data and live in production, I\'d recommend a step by step approach, so as to avoid downtime in production while waiting for the migrations.First I\'d create a db migration to add columns with the new name(s) and populate them with the values from the old column name.Then I\'d commit just that change, and push the change into production.Then once the commit has been pushed into production, I\'d run.Then I\'d update all of the views/controllers that referenced the old column name to the new column name.  Run through my test suite, and commit just those changes. (After making sure it was working locally and passing all tests first!)Then I\'d push that commit to production. At this point you can remove the original column without worrying about any sort of downtime associated with the migration itself.Then push this latest migration to production and run bundle exec rake db:migrate in the background.I realize this is a bit more involved of a process, but I\'d rather do this than have issues with my production migration.From API:It renames a column but keeps the type and content remains same.Run the below command to create a migration file:Then in the file generated in the db/migrate folder, write rename_column as below:Some versions of Ruby on Rails support to up/down method to migration and if you have up/down method in your migration, then:If you have the change method in your migration, then:For more information you can move: Ruby on Rails - Migrations or Active Record Migrations.If your code is not shared with other one, then best option is to do just rake db:rollback\nthen edit your column name in migration and rake db:migrate. Thats itAnd you can write another migration to rename the column Thats it.If you need to switch column names you will need to create a placeholder to avoid a duplicate column name error. Here\'s an example:As an alternative option, if you are not married to the idea of migrations, there is a compelling gem for ActiveRecord which will handle the name changes automatically for you, Datamapper style. All you do is change the column name in your model (and make sure you put Model.auto_upgrade! at the bottom of your model.rb) and viola! Database is updated on the fly. https://github.com/DAddYE/mini_recordNote: You will need to nuke db/schema.rb to prevent conflictsStill in beta phases and obviously not for everyone but still a compelling choice (I am currently using it in two non-trivial production apps with no issues)Simply create a new migration, and in a block, use rename_column as below.For Ruby on Rails 4:If the present data is not important for you, you can just take down your original migration using:Without the quotes, then make changes in the original migration and run the up migration again by:Manually we can use the below method:We can edit the migration manually like:Open app/db/migrate/xxxxxxxxx_migration_file.rbUpdate hased_password to hashed_passwordRun the below commandThen it will remove your migration:It will add your migration with the updated change.Run rails g migration ChangesNameInUsers (or whatever you would like to name it)Open the migration file that has just been generated, and add this line in the method (in between def change and end):rename_column :table_name, :the_name_you_want_to_change, :the_new_nameSave the file, and run rake db:migrate in the consoleCheck out your schema.db in order to see if the name has actually changed in the database!Hope this helps :)Generate the migration file:# Creates db/migrate/xxxxxxxxxx.rbEdit the migration to do your will.Generate a Ruby on Rails migration:Insert code in the migration file (XXXXXfixcolumnname.rb):Open that migration file and  modify that file as below(Do enter your original table_name)Open your Ruby on Rails console and enter:You have two ways to do this:In this type it automatically runs the reverse code of it, when rollback.To this type, it runs the up method when rake db:migrate and runs the down method when rake db:rollback:Update - A close cousin of create_table is change_table, used for changing existing tables. It is used in a similar fashion to create_table but the object yielded to the block knows more tricks. For example:This way is more efficient if we do with other alter methods such as: remove/add index/remove index/add column, eg we can do further like:
