Java EE has ServletRequest.getParameterValues().On non-EE platforms, URL.getQuery() simply returns a string.What\'s the normal way to properly parse the query string in a URL when not on Java EE?  <rant>It is popular in the answers to try and make your own parser.  This is very interesting and exciting micro-coding project, but I cannot say that it is a good idea :(The code snippets below are generally flawed or broken, btw.  Breaking them is an interesting exercise for the reader.  And to the hackers attacking the websites that use them.Parsing query strings is a well defined problem but reading the spec and understanding the nuances is non-trivial.  It is far better to let some platform library coder do the hard work, and do the fixing, for you!</rant>Since Android M things have got more complicated. The answer of android.net.URI.getQueryParameter() has a bug which breaks spaces before JellyBean.\nApache URLEncodedUtils.parse() worked, but was deprecated in L, and removed in M. So the best answer now is UrlQuerySanitizer. This has existed since API level 1 and still exists. It also makes you think about the tricky issues like how do you handle special characters, or repeated values.The simplest code is On Android:On Android, the Apache libraries provide a Query parser:http://developer.android.com/reference/org/apache/http/client/utils/URLEncodedUtils.html and http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/client/utils/URLEncodedUtils.htmlHere is BalusC\'s answer, but it compiles and returns results:If you have jetty (server or client) libs on your classpath you can use the jetty util classes (see javadoc), e.g.:If you\'re using Spring 3.1 or greater (yikes, was hoping that support went back further), you can use the UriComponents and UriComponentsBuilder:components.getQueryParams() returns a MultiValueMap<String, String>Here\'s some more documentation.For a servlet or a JSP page you can get querystring key/value pairs by using request.getParameter("paramname")There are other ways of doing it but that\'s the way I do it in all the servlets and jsp pages that I create.Parsing the query string is a bit more complicated than it seems, depending on how forgiving you want to be.First, the query string is ascii bytes.  You read in these bytes one at a time and convert them to characters.  If the character is ? or & then it signals the start of a parameter name.  If the character is = then it signals the start of a paramter value.  If the character is % then it signals the start of an encoded byte.  Here is where it gets tricky.When you read in a % char you have to read the next two bytes and interpret them as hex digits.  That means the next two bytes will be 0-9, a-f or A-F.  Glue these two hex digits together to get your byte value.  But remember, bytes are not characters.  You have to know what encoding was used to encode the characters.  The character \xc3\xa9 does not encode the same in UTF-8 as it does in ISO-8859-1.  In general it\'s impossible to know what encoding was used for a given character set.  I always use UTF-8 because my web site is configured to always serve everything using UTF-8 but in practice you can\'t be certain.  Some user-agents will tell you the character encoding in the request; you can try to read that if you have a full HTTP request.  If you just have a url in isolation, good luck.Anyway, assuming you are using UTF-8 or some other multi-byte character encoding, now that you\'ve decoded one encoded byte you have to set it aside until you capture the next byte.  You need all the encoded bytes that are together because you can\'t url-decode properly one byte at a time.  Set aside all the bytes that are together then decode them all at once to reconstruct your character.Plus it gets more fun if you want to be lenient and account for user-agents that mangle urls.  For example, some webmail clients double-encode things.  Or double up the ?&= chars (for example:  http://yoursite.com/blah??p1==v1&&p2==v2).  If you want to try to gracefully deal with this, you will need to add more logic to your parser.Just for reference, this is what I\'ve ended up with (based on URLEncodedUtils, and returning a Map).Features:Code:A compatibility helper (values are stored in a String array just as in ServletRequest.getParameterMap()):On Android, I tried using @diyism answer but I encountered the space character issue raised by @rpetrich, for example:\nI fill out a form where username = "us+us" and password = "pw pw" causing a URL string to look like:However, @diyism code returns "us+us" and "pw+pw", i.e. it doesn\'t detect the space character. If the URL was rewritten with %20 the space character gets identified:This leads to the following fix:I have to methods to acheve this:1):2) and the easiest way to do this Using Uri class :and this is an example of how to use either of two methods:the value of tagValue is 800This works for me..\nI\'m not sure why every one was after a Map, List>\nAll I needed was a simple name value Map.To keep things simple I used the build in URI.getQuery(); On Android, you can use the Uri.parse static method of the android.net.Uri class to do the heavy lifting.  If you\'re doing anything with URIs and Intents you\'ll want to use it anyways.Guava\'s Multimap is better suited for this. Here is a short clean version:On Android its simple as the code below:Also if you don\'t want to register each expected query key use:Before calling:Apache AXIS2 has a self-contained implementation of QueryStringParser.java. If you are not using Axis2, just download the sourcecode and test case from here -http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/axis/axis2/java/core/trunk/modules/kernel/src/org/apache/axis2/transport/http/util/QueryStringParser.javahttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/axis/axis2/java/core/trunk/modules/kernel/test/org/apache/axis2/transport/http/util/QueryStringParserTest.javaI don\'t think there is one in JRE. You can find similar functions in other packages like Apache HttpClient. If you don\'t use any other packages, you just have to write your own. It\'s not that hard. Here is what I use,Based on the answer from BalusC, i wrote some example-Java-Code:Use Apache HttpComponents and wire it up with some collection code to access params by value: http://www.joelgerard.com/2012/09/14/parsing-query-strings-in-java-and-accessing-values-by-key/using Guava:this method takes the uri and return map of par name and par valueYou say "Java" but "not Java EE". Do you mean you are using JSP and/or servlets but not a full Java EE stack? If that\'s the case, then you should still have request.getParameter() available to you.If you mean you are writing Java but you are not writing JSPs nor servlets, or that you\'re just using Java as your reference point but you\'re on some other platform that doesn\'t have built-in parameter parsing ... Wow, that just sounds like an unlikely question, but if so, the principle would be:(I could write Java code but that would be pointless, because if you have Java available, you can just use request.getParameters.)
