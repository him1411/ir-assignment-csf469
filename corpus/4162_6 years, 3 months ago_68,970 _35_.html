I\'m trying to make an ArrayList Parcelable in order to pass to an activity a list of custom object. I start writing a myObjectList class which extends ArrayList<myObject> and implement Parcelable.Some attributes of MyObject are boolean but Parcel don\'t have  any method read/writeBoolean.What is the best way to handle this?Here\'s how I\'d do it...writeToParcel:readFromParcel:You could also make use of the writeValue method. In my opinion that\'s the most straightforward solution.Afterwards you can easily retrieve it with a simple cast to Boolean:Under the hood the Android Framework will handle it as an integer:you declare like thiswrite readboolean type needs to be converted to something that Parcel supports and so we can convert it to int.I normally have them in an array and call writeBooleanArray and readBooleanArrayIf it\'s a single boolean you need to pack, you could do this:I suggested you the easiest way to implement Parcelable if you are using Android Studio. Simply go to File->Settings->Plugins->Browse Repository and search for parcelable .See image\nIt will automatically create Parcelable.And there is a webiste also for doing this. http://www.parcelabler.com/You could pack your boolean values into a byte using masking and shifting. That would be the most efficient way to do it and is probably what they would expect you to do.It is hard to identify the real question here. I guess it is how to deal with booleans when implementing the Parcelable interface.Some attributes of MyObject are boolean but Parcel don\'t have any method read/writeBoolean.You will have to either store the value as a string or as a byte. If you go for a string then you\'ll have to use the static method of the String class called valueOf() to parse the boolean value. It isn\'t as effective as saving it in a byte tough.If you go for a byte you\'ll have to implement a conversion logic yourself.When unmarshalling the Parcel object you have to take care of the conversion to the original type.AndroidStudio (using 2.3 atm), after implementing Parcelable on your class, you can simply hold your mouse pointer over your class name and it asks you to add the parcelable implementation:From the four fields, it generates the following:This question has already been answered perfectly by other people, if you want to do it on your own.If you prefer to encapsulate or hide away most of the low-level parceling code, you might consider using some of the code I wrote some time ago for simplifying handling of parcelables.Writing to a parcel is as easy as:where color is an enum and isDriving is a boolean, for example.Reading from a parcel is also not much harder:Just take a look at the "ParceldroidExample" I added to the project.Finally, it also keeps the CREATOR initializer short:
