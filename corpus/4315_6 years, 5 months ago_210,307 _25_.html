Git stash seems to do a lot of what I want, except that it is a little hard to script, as the if you have no changes, then git stash; git stash pop will do something different than if you do have changes in your repository.It appears that git stash create is the answer to that problem, and everything works, except for one thing\xe2\x80\xa6 I can\'t get rid of the created stash. Is there any way to get rid of the stash?To make it 100% clear what I am doing:Create the stash:Use the stash:Delete the stash: (except that this last bit doesn\'t work)You don\'t need to delete a stash created in this manner. Since nothing references the stash commit, it will get garbage collected eventually.Update: To clarify, the original question asks specifically about git stash create, not the default git stash save. To drop a typical stash, see Charles\'s excellent answer.git stash drop takes no parameter - which drops the top stash - or a stash reference which looks like: stash@{n} which n nominates which stash to drop. You can\'t pass a commit id to git stash drop.I\'m not sure why you think need to drop a stash because if you are using stash create a stash entry isn\'t created for your "stash" so there isn\'t anything to drop.If you are 100% sure that you have just one stash (make a git stash list to be 107% sure), you can do aand forget about them (it deletes all stashes).Note: Added this answer for those who ended up here looking for a way to clear them all (like me).You should be using and not because this creates a stash (which is a regular commit object) and return its object name, without storing it anywhere in the ref namespace. Hence won\'t be accessible with stash apply.Use git stash save "some comment" is used when you have unstaged changes you wanna replicate/move onto another branchUse git stash apply stash@{0} (assuming your saved stash index is 0) when you want your saved(stashed) changes to reflect on your current branchyou can always use git stash list to check all you stash indexesand use git stash drop stash@{0} (assuming your saved stash index is 0 and you wanna delete it) to delete a particular stash.From git doc: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-stashdrop [-q|--quiet] []Remove a single stashed state from the stash list. When no  is given, it removes the latest one. i.e. stash@{0}, otherwise  must be a valid stash log reference of the form stash@{}.example:This would delete the stash entry 5.
