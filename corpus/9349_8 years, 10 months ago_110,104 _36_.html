In VB.NET, what is the difference between And and AndAlso? Which should I use?The And operator evaluates both sides, where AndAlso evaluates the right side if and only if the left side is true.An example:The above throws an exception if mystring = NothingThis one does not throw an exception.So if you come from the C# world, you should use AndAlso like you would use &&.More info here: http://www.panopticoncentral.net/2003/08/18/the-ballad-of-andalso-and-orelse/The And operator will check all conditions in the statement before continuing, whereas the Andalso operator will stop if it knows the condition is false. For example:Checks if x is equal to 5, and if y is equal to 7, then continues if both are true.Checks if x is equal to 5. If it\'s not, it doesn\'t check if y is 7, because it knows that the condition is false already. (This is called short-circuiting.)Generally people use the short-circuiting method if there\'s a reason to explicitly not check the second part if the first part is not true, such as if it would throw an exception if checked. For example:If that used And instead of AndAlso, it would still try to Object.Load() even if it were nothing, which would throw an exception.Evaluates both Bool1 and Bool2Evaluates Bool2 if and only if Bool1 is true.Just for all those people who say side effects are evil: a place where having two side effects in one condition is good would be reading two file objects in tandem.Using the And ensures that a row is consumed every time the condition is checked. Whereas AndAlso might read the last line of File1 and leave File2 without a consumed line.Of course the code above wouldn\'t work, but I use side effects like this all the time and wouldn\'t consider it "bad" or "evil" code as some would lead you to believe. It\'s easy to read and efficient.Interestingly none of the answers mentioned that And and Or in VB.NET are bit operators whereas OrElse and AndAlso are strictly Boolean operators.Note: a non zero integer is considered true; Dim e = not 0 will set e to -1 demonstrating Not is also a bit operator.|| and && (the C# versions of OrElse and AndAlso) return the last evaluated expression which would be 3 and 5 respectively. This lets you use the idiom v || 5 in C# to give 5 as the value of the expression when v is null or (0 and an integer) and the value of v otherwise. The difference in semantics can catch a C# programmer dabbling in VB.NET off guard as this "default value idiom" doesn\'t work in VB.NET.So, to answer the question: Use Or and And for bit operations (integer or Boolean). Use OrElse and AndAlso to "short circuit" an operation to save time, or test the validity of an evaluation prior to evaluating it. If valid(evaluation) andalso evaluation then or if not (unsafe(evaluation) orelse (not evaluation)) thenBonus: What is the value of the following?A simple way to think about it is using even plainer EnglishAndAlso is much like And, except it works like && in C#, C++, etc.The difference is that if the first clause (the one before AndAlso) is true, the second clause is never evaluated - the compound logical expression is "short circuited".This is sometimes very useful, e.g. in an expression such as:Using the old And in the above expression would throw a NullReferenceException if myObj were null.Also see Stack Overflow question: Should I always use the AndAlso and OrElse operators?.Also: A comment for those who mentioned using And if the right side of the expression has a side-effect you need:If the right side has a side effect you need, just move it to the left side rather than using "And". You only really need "And" if both sides have side effects. And if you have that many side effects going on you\'re probably doing something else wrong. In general, you really should prefer AndAlso.In addition to the answers above, AndAlso provides a conditioning process known as short circuiting. Many programming languages have this functionality built in like vb.net does, and can provide substantial performance increases in long condition statements by cutting out evaluations that are unneccessary.Another similar condition is the OrElse condition which would only check the right condition if the left condition is false, thus cutting out unneccessary condition checks after a true condition is found.I would advise you to always use short circuiting processes and structure your conditional statements in ways that can benefit the most by this. For example, test your most efficient and fastest conditions first so that you only run your long conditions when you absolutely have to and short circuit the other times. For majority of us OrElse and AndAlso will do the trick except for a few confusing exceptions (less than 1% where we may have to use Or and And).Try not to get carried away by people showing off their boolean logics and making it look like a rocket science. It\'s quite simple and straight forward and occasionally your system may not work as expected because it doesn\'t like your logic in the first place. And yet your brain keeps telling you that his logic is 100% tested and proven and it should work. At that very moment stop trusting your brain and ask him to think again or (not OrElse or maybe OrElse) you force yourself to look for another job that doesn\'t require much logic.
