When I type uname -a, it gives the following output.How can I know from this that the given OS is 32 or 64 bit?This is useful when writing configure scripts, for example: what architecture am I building for?Try uname -m. Which is short of uname --machine and it outputs: Otherwise, not for the Linux kernel, but for the CPU, you type:or:Under "flags" parameter, you will see various values: see "What do the flags in /proc/cpuinfo mean?"\nAmong them, one is named lm: Long Mode (x86-64: amd64, also known as Intel 64, i.e. 64-bit capable)Or using lshw (as mentioned below by Rolf of Saxony), without sudo (just for grepping the cpu width):Note: you can have a 64-bit CPU with a 32-bit kernel installed.\n(as ysdx mentions in his/her own answer, "Nowadays, a system can be multiarch so it does not make sense anyway. You might want to find the default target of the compiler")If you were running a 64 bit platform you would see x86_64 or something very similar in the output from uname -aTo get your specific machine hardware name runYou can also callwhich returns either 32 or 64lscpu will list out these among other information regarding your CPU:Another useful command for easy determination is as below:Command:Answer:The command is equivalent to but is twice as fast to typeI was wondering about this specifically for building software in Debian (the installed Debian system can be a 32-bit version with a 32 bit kernel, libraries, etc., or it can be a 64-bit version with stuff compiled for the 64-bit rather than 32-bit compatibility mode). Debian packages themselves need to know what architecture they are for (of course) when they actually create the package with all of its metadata, including platform architecture, so there is a packaging tool that outputs it for other packaging tools and scripts to use, called dpkg-architecture. It includes both what it\'s configured to build for, as well as the current host. (Normally these are the same though.)  Example output on a 64-bit machine:You can print just one of those variables or do a test against their values with command line options to dpkg-architecture.  I have no idea how dpkg-architecture deduces the architecture, but you could look at its documentation or source code (dpkg-architecture and much of the dpkg system in general are Perl).If you have a 64-bit OS, instead of i686, you have x86_64 or ia64 in the output of uname -a. In that you do not have any of these two strings; you have a 32-bit OS (note that this does not mean that your CPU is not 64-bit).That system is 32bit. iX86 in uname means it is a 32-bit architecture. If it was 64 bit, it would return With respect to the answer "getconf LONG_BIT".I wrote a simple function to do it in \'C\':Good idea, the \'getconf\'!Nowadays, a system can be multiarch so it does not make sense anyway. You might want to find the default target of the compiler:You can try to compile a hello world:You can also check using a environment variable:Result:i386 -> 32 bitsx86_64 -> 64 bitsExtracted from: http://www.sysadmit.com/2016/02/linux-como-saber-si-es-32-o-64-bits.htmlgetconf uses the fewest system calls:In Bash, using integer overflow:It\'s much more efficient than invoking another process or opening files.Simple script to get 64 bit or 32 bitI can\'t believe that in all this time, no one has mentioned:to get details about the speed, quantity, size and capabilities of the CPU hardware.If one is severely limited in available binaries (e.g. in initramfs), my colleagues suggested:On my ALT Linux systems, i586 has /lib/ld-linux.so.2 and x86_64 has /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2.If you shift 1 left by 32 and you get 1, your system is 32 bit.\nIf you shift 1 left by 64 and you get 1, your system is 64 bit.In other words, if echo $((1<<32)) gives 1 then your system is 32 bit.if echo $((1<<64)) gives 1 then your system is 64 bit.[ -z uname -m | grep 64 ] && echo "32-bit" || echo "64-bit"Based on the fact that 64-bit is usually x86_64 and 32-bit is i686 etc.First you have to download Virtual Box. Then select new and a 32-bit Linux. Then boot the linux using it. If it boots then it is 32 bit if it doesn\'t then it is a 64 bit.
