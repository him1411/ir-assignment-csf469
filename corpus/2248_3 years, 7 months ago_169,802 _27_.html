I understand that ng-show and ng-hide affect the class set on an element and that ng-if controls whether an element is rendered as part of the DOM. Are there guidelines on choosing ng-if over ng-show/ng-hide or vice-versa?Depends on your use case but to summarise the difference:Elements that are not in the DOM have less performance impact and your web app might appear to be faster when using ng-if compared to ng-show/ng-hide. In my experience, the difference is negligible. Animations are possible when using both ng-show/ng-hide and ng-if, with examples for both in the Angular documentation.Ultimately, the question you need to answer is whether you can remove element from DOM or not?See here for a CodePen that demonstrates the difference in how ng-if/ng-show work, DOM-wise.@markovuksanovic has answered the question well. But I\'d come at it from another perspective: I\'d always use ng-if and get those elements out of DOM, unless: Angular is written really well. It\'s fast, considering what it does. But what it does is a whole bunch of magic that makes hard things (like 2-way data-binding) look trivially easy. Making all those things look easy entails some performance overhead. You might be shocked to realize how many hundreds or thousands of times a setter function gets evaluated during the $digest cycle on a hunk of DOM that nobody\'s even looking at. And then you realize you\'ve got dozens or hundreds of invisible elements all doing the same thing...Desktops may indeed be powerful enough to render most JS execution-speed issues moot. But if you\'re developing for mobile, using ng-if whenever humanly possible should be a no-brainer. JS speed still matters on mobile processors. Using ng-if is a very easy way to get potentially-significant optimization at very, very low cost.From my experience:1) If your page has a toggle that uses ng-if/ng-show to show/hide something, ng-if causes more of a browser delay (slower). For example: if you have a button used to toggle between two views, ng-show seems to be faster.2) ng-if will create/destroy scope when it evaluates to true/false.  If you have a controller attached to the ng-if, that controller code will get executed every time the ng-if evaluates to true.  If you are using ng-show, the controller code only gets executed once.  So if you have a button that toggles between multiple views, using ng-if and ng-show would make a huge difference in how you write your controller code.The answer is not simple:It depends on the target machines (mobile vs desktop), it depends on the nature of your data, the browser, the OS, the hardware it runs on... you will need to benchmark if you really want to know.It is mostly a memory vs computation problem ... as with most performance issues the difference can become significant with repeated elements (n) like lists, especially when nested (n x n, or worse) and also what kind of computations you run inside these elements:ng-show: If those optional elements are often present (dense), like say 90% of the\ntime, it may be faster to have them ready and only show/hide them, especially if their content is cheap (just plain text, nothing to compute or load). This consumes memory as it fills the DOM with hidden elements, but just show/hide something which already exists is likely to be a cheap operation for the browser.ng-if: If on the contrary elements are likely not to be shown (sparse) just build them and destroy them in real time, especially if their content is expensive to get (computations/sorted/filtered, images, generated images). This is ideal for rare or \'on-demand\' elements, it saves memory in terms of not filling the DOM but can cost a lot of computation (creating/destroying elements) and bandwidth (getting remote content). It also depends on how much you compute in the view (filtering/sorting) vs what you already have in the model (pre-sorted/pre-filtered data).One important note:ngIf (unlike ngShow) usually creates child scopes that may produce unexpected results.I had an issue related to this and I\'ve spent MUCH time to figure out what was going on.(My directive was writing its model values to the wrong scope.)So, to save your hair just use ngShow unless you run too slow.The performance difference is barely noticable anyway and I am not sure yet on who\'s favour is it without a test...If you use ng-show or ng-hide the content (eg. thumbnails from server) will be loaded irrespective of the value of expression but will be displayed based on the value of the expression.If you use ng-if the content will be loaded only if the expression of the ng-if evaluates to truthy.Using ng-if is a good idea in a situation where you are going to load data or images from the server and show those only depending on users interaction. This way your page load will not be blocked by unnecessary nw intensive tasks.ng-if on ng-include and on ng-controller will have a big impact matter\non ng-include it will not load the required partial and does not process unless flag is true\non ng-controller it will not load the controller unless flag is true\nbut the problem is when a flag gets false in ng-if it will remove from DOM when flag gets true back it will reload the DOM in this case ng-show is better, for one time show ng-if is better
