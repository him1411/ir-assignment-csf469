I need a select which would return results like this:And I need all results, i.e. this includes strings with \'word2 word3 word1\' or \'word1 word3 word2\' or any other combination of the three.All words need to be in the result.Rather slow, but working method to include any of words:If you need all words to be present, use this:If you want something faster, you need to look into full text search, and this is very specific for each database type.Note that if you use LIKE to determine if a string is a substring of another string, you must escape the pattern matching characters in your search string.If your SQL dialect supports CHARINDEX, it\'s a lot easier to  use it instead:Also, please keep in mind that this and the method in the accepted answer only cover substring matching rather than word matching. So, for example, the string \'word1word2word3\' would still match.Changed OR to AND based on edit to question.If you just want to find a match.SQL Server :To get exact match. Example (\';a;ab;ac;\',\';b;\') will not get a match.Instead of SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE Column1 CONTAINS \'word1 word2 word3\',\nadd And in between those words like:for more details, see here\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187787.aspxIf you are using Oracle Database then you can achieve this using contains query. Contains querys are faster than like query.If you need all of the wordsIf you need any of the wordsContains need  index of type CONTEXT on your column.or This will display all the records where column1 has a partial value contains word.try to use the "tesarus search" in full text index in MS SQL Server. This is much better than using "%" in search if you have millions of records. tesarus have a small amount of memory consumption than the others.\ntry to search this functions :)
