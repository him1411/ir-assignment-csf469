I am getting an \'access is denied\' error when I attempt to delete a folder that is not empty. I used the following command in my attempt: os.remove("/folder_name"). What is the most effective way of removing/deleting a folder/directory that is not empty?Standard Library Reference: shutil.rmtree.From the python docs on os.walk():from python 3.4 you may use :where pth is a pathlib.Path instance. Nice, but may not be the fastest.If ignore_errors is set, errors are ignored; otherwise, if onerror is set, it is called to handle the error with arguments (func, path, exc_info) where func is os.listdir, os.remove, or os.rmdir; path is the argument to that function that caused it to fail; and exc_info is a tuple returned by sys.exc_info(). If ignore_errors is false and onerror is None, an exception is raised.enter code hereBase on kkubasik\'s answer, check if folder exists before remove, more robustif you are sure, that you want to delete the entire dir tree, and are no more interested in contents of dir, then crawling for entire dir tree is stupidness... just call native OS command from python to do that. It will be faster, efficient and less memory consuming. or *nix  In python, the code will look like..From docs.python.org:This example shows how to remove a directory tree on Windows where\n  some of the files have their read-only bit set. It uses the onerror\n  callback to clear the readonly bit and reattempt the remove. Any\n  subsequent failure will propagate.Just some python 3.5 options to complete the answers above. (I would have loved to find them here).Delete folder if emptyDelete also folder if it contains this filedelete folder if it contains only .srt or .txt file(s)Delete folder if its size is less than 400kb :If you don\'t want to use the shutil module you can just use the os module.To delete a folder even if it might not exist (avoiding the race condition in Charles Chow\'s answer) but still have errors when other things go wrong (e.g. permission problems, disk read error, the file isn\'t a directory)For Python 3.x:The Python 2.7 code is almost the same:You can use os.system command for simplicity:As obvious, it actually invokes system terminal to accomplish this task.
