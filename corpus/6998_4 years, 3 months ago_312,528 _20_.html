I have a dataframe in pandas which I would like to write to a CSV file. I am doing this using:And getting the error:Is there any way to get around this easily (i.e. I have unicode characters in my data frame)? And is there a way to write to a tab delimited file instead of a CSV using e.g. a \'to-tab\' method (that I dont think exists)?To delimit by a tab you can use the sep argument of to_csv:To use a specific encoding (e.g. \'utf-8\') use the encoding argument:Sometimes you face these problems if you specify UTF-8 encoding also.\nI recommend you to specify encoding while reading file and same encoding while writing to file.\nThis might solve your problem.Something else you can try if you are having issues encoding to \'utf-8\' and want to go cell by cell you could try the following. (Where "df" is your DataFrame object.)Then try:You can check the encoding of the columns by:Warning: errors=\'ignore\' will just omit the character e.g.I\'d like to add something to what Andy Hayden already mentioned in his precise answer. When you are storing a DataFrame object into a csv file using the to_csv method, you probably wont be needing to store the preceding indices of each row of the DataFrame object.You can avoid that by passing a False boolean value to index parameter.Somewhat like:So if your DataFrame object is something like:The csv file will store:instead of (the case when the default value True was passed)Found it worth sharing, Cheers! :-)df.to_csv(\'out.csv\', sep=\',\')It will work definitely, change "df" to your data frame name and run.(Use anaconda idle)
