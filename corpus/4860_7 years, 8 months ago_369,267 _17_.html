What is the "best" way to handle command-line arguments?It seems like there are several answers on what the "best" way is and as a result I am stuck on how to handle something as simple as:ANDIs there a plugin that can handle this better? I know I am reinventing the wheel here.Obviously what I have already isn\'t pretty and surely isn\'t the "best", but it works.. and it is UGLY.You are reinventing the wheel. Normal PowerShell scripts have parameters starting with -, like script.ps1 -server http://devserverThen you handle them in param section in the beginning of the file (see tutorial: https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/powershell-abcs-p-is-for-parameters)You can also assign default values to your params, read them from console if not available or stop script execution:Inside the script you can simplysince all parameters become variables available in script scope.In this example, the $server gets a default value if the script is called without it, script stops if you omit the -username parameter and asks for terminal input if -password is omitted.Update:\nYou might as well want to pass a "flag" (a boolean true/false parameter) to a PowerShell script. For instance, your script may accept a "force" where the script runs in a more careful mode when force is not used.The keyword for that is [switch] parameter type:Inside the script then you would work with it like this:Now, when calling the script you\'d set the switch/flag parameter like this:If you explicitly want to state that the flag is not set, there is a special syntax for thatLinks to relevant Microsoft documentation (for PowerShell 5.0; tho versions 3.0 and 4.0 are also available at the links):
