What\'s the simplest way to do a find and replace for a given input string, say abc, and replace with another string, say XYZ in file /tmp/file.txt?I am writting an app and using IronPython to execute commands through SSH â€” but I don\'t know Unix that well and don\'t know what to look for.I have heard that Bash, apart from being a command line interface, can be a very powerful scripting language. So, if this is true, I assume you can perform actions like these.Can I do it with bash, and what\'s the simplest (one line) script to achieve my goal?The easiest way is to use sed (or perl):sed -i -e \'s/abc/XYZ/g\' /tmp/file.txtWhich will invoke sed to do an in-place edit due to the -i option.  This can be called from bash.If you really really want to use just bash, then the following can work:while read a ; do echo ${a//abc/XYZ} ; done < /tmp/file.txt > /tmp/file.txt.t ; mv /tmp/file.txt{.t,}This loops over each line, doing a substitution, and writing to a temporary file (don\'t want to clobber the input).  The move at the end just moves temporary to the original name.File manipulation isn\'t normally done by Bash, but by programs invoked by Bash, e.g.:The -i flag tells it to do an in-place replacement.See man perlrun for more details, including how to take a backup of the original file.I was surprised because i stumbled over this...There is a "replace" command which ships with the package "mysql-server", so if you have installed it try it out:See man replace for more on this...Bash, like other shells, is just a tool for coordinating other commands. Typically you would try to use standard UNIX commands, but you can of course use Bash to invoke anything, including your own compiled programs, other shell scripts, Python and Perl scripts etc.In this case, there are a couple of ways to do it.If you want to read a file, and write it to another file, doing search/replace as you go, use sed:If you want to edit the file in place (as if opening the file in an editor, editing it, then saving it) supply instructions to the line editor \'ex\'Ex is like vi without the fullscreen mode. You can give it the same commands you would at vi\'s \':\' prompt. Found this thread among others and I agree it contains the most complete answers so I add mine too:1) sed and ed are so useful...by hand!!!\nLook at this code from @Johnny:2) when my restriction is to use it by a shell script then, no variable can be used inside in place of abc or XYZ! This seems to agree with what I understand at least. So, I can\'t use:but, what can we do? As, @Johnny said use a \'while read...\' but, unfortunately that\'s not the end of the story. The following worked well with me:3) As one can see if nullglob is set then, it behaves strangely when there is a string containing a * as inwhich becomesthere is no ending angle bracket and Apache2 can\'t even load!4) This kind of parsing should be slower than one-hit search and replace but, as you already have seen, there are 4 variables for 4 different search patterns working out of one only parse cycle!The most suitable solution I can think of with the given assumptions of the problem.This is an old post but for anyone wanting to use variables as @centurian said the single quotes mean nothing will be expanded. A simple way to get variables in is to do string concatenation since this is done by juxtaposition in bash the following should work:sed -i -e \'s/\'"$var1"\'/\'"$var2"\'/g\' /tmp/file.txtYou may also use the ed command to do in-file search and replace:See more on bash-hackers site You can use sed Use i for ignore case if You not sure text to find is abc or ABC or AbC ,...You can use find and sed if you don\'t now your filename:Find and replace in all python files:Be careful if you replace URLs with "/" character.An example of how to do it:Extracted from: http://www.sysadmit.com/2015/07/linux-reemplazar-texto-en-archivos-con-sed.htmlfind ./  -type f -name "file*.txt" | xargs sed -i -e \'s/abc/xyz/g\'To edit text in the file non-interactively, you need in-place text editor such as vim.Here is simple example how to use it from the command line:This is equivalent to @slim answer of ex editor which is basically the same thing.Here are few ex practical examples.Replacing text foo with bar in the file:Removing trailing whitespaces for multiple files:See also:You can use rpl command.  For example you want to change domain name in whole php project.This is  not clear bash of cause, but it\'s a very quick and usefull.  :)You can use python within the bash script too. I didn\'t have much success with some of the top answers here, and found this to work without the need for loops:If the file you are working on is not so big, and temporarily storing it in a variable is no problem, then you can use Bash string substitution on the whole file at once - there\'s no need to go over it line by line:The whole file contents will be treated as one long string, including linebreaks. XYZ can be a variable eg $replacement, and one advantage of not using sed here is that you need not be concerned that the search or replace string might contain the sed pattern delimiter character (usually, but not necessarily, /). A disadvantage is not being able to use regular expressions or any of sed\'s more sophisticated operations.
