I want to move a table into a specific Schema using T-SQL? I am using SQL Server 2008.If you want to move all tables into a new schema, you can use the undocumented (and to be deprecated at some point, but unlikely!) sp_MSforeachtable stored procedure:Ref.: ALTER SCHEMA SQL 2008: How do I change db schema to dboShort answer:I can confirm that the data in the table remains intact, which is probably quite important :)Long answer as per MSDN docs, If it\'s a table (or anything besides a Type or XML Schema collection), you can leave out the word Object since that\'s the default.
