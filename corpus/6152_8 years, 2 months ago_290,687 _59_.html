I want to add the oracle jdbc driver to my project as dependency (runtime scope) - ojdbc14.\nIn MVNrepository site the dependency to put in the POM is:of course this does\'t work as it is not in the central repository used by maven.\n2 questions:How do I find a repository (if any) that contains this artifact?How do I add it so that Maven will use it?How do I find a repository (if any) that contains this artifact?Unfortunately due the binary license there is no public repository with the Oracle Driver JAR. This happens with many dependencies but is not Maven\'s fault. If you happen to find a public repository containing the JAR you can be sure that is illegal.How do I add it so that Maven will use it?Some JARs that can\'t be added due to license reasons have a pom entry in the Maven Central repo. Just check it out, it contains the vendor\'s preferred Maven info:...and the URL to download the file which in this case is\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html.Once you\'ve downloaded the JAR just add it to your computer repository with (note I pulled the groupId, artifactId and version from the POM):The last parameter for generating a POM will save you from pom.xml warningsIf your team has a local Maven repository this guide might be helpful to upload the JAR there.For whatever reason, I could not get any of the above solutions to work.  (Still can\'t.)What I did instead was to include the jar in my project (blech) and then create a "system" dependency for it that indicates the path to the jar.  It\'s probably not the RIGHT way to do it, but it does work.  And it eliminates the need for the other developers on the team (or the guy setting up the build server) to put the jar in their local repositories.UPDATE:  This solution works for me when I run Hibernate Tools.  It does NOT appear to work for building the WAR file, however.  It doesn\'t include the ojdbc6.jar file in the target WAR file.1) Create a directory called "lib" in the root of your project.2) Copy the ojdbc6.jar file there (whatever the jar is called.)3) Create a dependency that looks something like this:Ugly, but works for me.To include the files in the war file add the following to your pomDownload the jar and place it in your project src/lib. Now you can use the maven installer plugin.Now you only have to execute mvn clean once and the oracle lib is installed in your local maven repository.Oracle is now exposing a maven repository at maven.oracle.com\nHowever you need to be authenticated.See https://blogs.oracle.com/WebLogicServer/entry/weblogic_server_and_the_oracleAccording to the comments in the blog post the ojdbc driver should be available at the following coordinates:Try with:You can use Nexus to manage 3rd party dependencies as well as dependencies in standard maven repositories.All Oracle Database JDBC Drivers are distribuited under the OTN License Agreement.If you read the OTN License Agreement you find this license term:so that\'s why you can\'t find the driver\'s jar in any public Maven Repository, because it would be distributed alone, and if it happened it would be a license violation.Adding the dependency:(or any later version) make Maven downloads the ojdbc14-10.2.0.3.0.pom only, and in that pom you can read:which informs you about the OTN License.In order to make the above dependency works I agree with victor hugo who were suggesting you here to manually install the jar into your local Maven repository (the .m2 directory) by running:but I want to add that the license term above doesn\'t limit only where you can\'t find the JDBC jar, but it limits where you install it too!In fact your local Maven repository must be private and not shared because if it was shared it would be a kind of distribution in which the jar is distributed alone, even if to a little group of people into your local area network, and this represent a OTN License Agreement violation.Moreover I think you should avoid installing the JDBC jar in your corporation repository manager (such as Artifactory or Nexus) as a single artifact because if it was installed it would be still distributed alone, even if to people in your organization only, and this represents a OTN License Agreement violation.The Oracle JDBC Driver is now available in the Oracle Maven Repository (not in Central).The Oracle Maven Repository requires a user registration. Instructions can be found in:https://blogs.oracle.com/dev2dev/entry/oracle_maven_repository_instructions_forUp to now, its not possible to use maven repositories. I\'m using ivy as dependency management tool, but also use maven2\' s ibiblio repositories. And this is working for ivy:Maven2\' s dependency could be something like that:Notice that i define http://download.java.net/maven/2/ and http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven/mule/dependencies/maven2/[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext] as external maven2 repos on my ivy settings.Some Oracle Products support publishing maven artifacts to a local repository. The products have a plugin/maven directory which contains descriptions where to find those artifacts and where to store them. There is a Plugin from Oracle which will actually do the upload.See: http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/config_maven.htmOne of the products which may ship OJDBC in this way is the WLS, it uses however quite strange coordinates:I ship opensource under LGPLv2 and even after several email conversations with Oracle they were unclear whether I was allowed to ship their binary JDBC driver with my distribution. The issue related to whether my license was compatible with their OTN terms so they suggested I was not permitted to ship the driver. Presumably related to this part(b) to distribute the programs with applications you have developed to your customers provided that each such licensee agrees to license terms consistent with the terms of this AgreementSo even if you manage to publish the driver legally in your exclusive/local maven repository there is still the restriction on what you are permitted to do with that artifact. Seems absurd that even if I ship their driver in binary form along with the full OTN license file I still can\'t use it and must force my users to manually download the Oracle driver and drop into my library path before they can use my software.Good news everyone! Finally we can use Oracle\'s official repo:\nhttps://blogs.oracle.com/dev2dev/get-oracle-jdbc-drivers-and-ucp-from-oracle-maven-repository-without-idesThere is one repo that provides the jar. In SBT add a resolver similar to this:\n"oracle driver repo" at "http://dist.codehaus.org/mule/dependencies/maven2"and a dependency:\n"oracle"             % "ojdbc14"              % "10.2.0.2"You can do the same with maven. pom.xml and jar are available (http://dist.codehaus.org/mule/dependencies/maven2/oracle/ojdbc14/10.2.0.2/).If you are using Netbeans, goto Dependencies and manually install artifact. Locate your downloaded .jar file and its done. clean build will solve any issues.SOLVEDThis repository needs to be enable for finding Oracle 10.0.3.0 dependecies (this setting needs to be done in Buildconfig.groovy\ngrails.project.dependency.resolver = "ivy" // or ivyAlso use following setting for compile time Oracle driver download runtime "com.oracle:ojdbc:10.2.0.3.0"This should solve your issue for not finding the Oracle driver for grails application
