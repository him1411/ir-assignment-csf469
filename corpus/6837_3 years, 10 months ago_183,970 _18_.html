I made changes to some of my files in my local repo, and then I did git add -A which I think added too many files to the staging area. How can I delete all the files from the staging area?After I do that, I\'ll just manually so git add "filename".You can unstage files from the index usingJust like git add, you can unstage files recursively by directory and so forth, so to unstage everything at once, run this from the root directory of your repository:Also, for future reference, the output of git status will tell you the commands you need to run to move files from one state to another.Useto unstage all the staged files.If you\'ve already committed a bunch of unwanted files, you can unstage them and tell git to mark them as deleted (without actually deleting them) with    --cached tells it to remove the paths from staging and the index without removing the files themselves and -r operates on directories recursively. You can then git add any files that you want to keep tracking.Answers here looks deprecated. I tested them on Ubuntu and none worked. Even the reset HEAD --, with or without dot.\nSo I\'m just sharing what really worked to me:git clean -dfSo, you should reset the changes withThen clean the untracked files and directories withTested and confirmed on Ubuntu 15.X. I hope this help the next ones.\nRegards.Reference: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cleanAs noted in other answers, you should use git reset. This will undo the action of the git add -A.Note: git reset is equivalent to git reset --mixed which does thisResets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated. This is the default action. [ git reset  ]
