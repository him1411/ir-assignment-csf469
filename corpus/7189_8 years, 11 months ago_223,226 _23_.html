I\'m trying to get a case-insensitive search with two strings in JavaScript working.Normally it would be like this:The /i flag would be for case-insensitive.But I need to search for a second string; without the flag it works perfect:If I add the /i flag to the above example it would search for searchstring and not for what is in the variable "searchstring" (next example not working):How can I achieve this?Yeah, use .match, rather than .search. The result from the .match call will return the actual string that was matched itself, but it can still be used as a boolean value.Using a regular expression like that is probably the tidiest and most obvious way to do that in JavaScript, but bear in mind it is a regular expression, and thus can contain regex metacharacters. If you want to take the string from elsewhere (eg, user input), or if you want to avoid having to escape a lot of metacharacters, then you\'re probably best using indexOf like this:ReplacewithIf you\'re just searching for a string rather than a more complicated regular expression, you can use indexOf() - but remember to lowercase both strings first because indexOf() is case sensitive:Or in a single line:Suppose we want to find the string variable needle in the string variable haystack. There are three gotchas:Taking points (1) and (2) into consideration, an example would be: If you are concerned about the "unterminated character class" case, removing all non-alphanumeric chars would be helpful:I like @CHR15TO\'s answer, unlike other answers I\'ve seen on other similar questions, that answer actually shows how to properly escape a user provided search string (rather than saying it would be necessary without showing how).However, it\'s still quite clunky, and possibly relatively slower. So why not have a specific solution to what is likely a common requirement for coders? (And why not include it in the ES6 API BTW?)My answer [https://stackoverflow.com/a/38290557/887092] on a similar question enables the following:There are two ways for case insensitive comparison:Convert strings to upper case and then compare them using the strict operator (===). How strict operator treats operands read stuff at:\nhttp://www.thesstech.com/javascript/relational-logical-operatorsPattern matching using string methods:Use the "search" string method for case insensitive search.\nRead about search and other string methods at:\nhttp://www.thesstech.com/pattern-matching-using-string-methods I noticed that if the user enters a string of text but leaves the input without selecting any of the autocomplete options no value is set in the hidden input, even if the string coincides with one in the array.\nSo, with help of the other answers I made this:
