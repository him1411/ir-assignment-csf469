I have some python code that splits on comma, but doesn\'t strip the whitespace:I would rather end up with whitespace removed like this:I am aware that I could loop through the list and strip() each item but, as this is Python, I\'m guessing there\'s a quicker, easier and more elegant way of doing it.Use list comprehension -- simpler, and just as easy to read as a for loop.See: Python docs on List Comprehension\nA good 2 second explanation of list comprehension.Split using a regular expression. Note I made the case more general with leading spaces. The list comprehension is to remove the null strings at the front and back.This works even if ^\\s+ doesn\'t match:Here\'s why you need ^\\s+:See the leading spaces in blah?Clarification: above uses the Python 3 interpreter, but results are the same in Python 2.I know this has already been answered, but if you end doing this a lot, regular expressions may be a better way to go:The \\s matches any whitespace character, and we just replace it with an empty string \'\'. You can find more info here: http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.subI came to add:map(str.strip, string.split(\',\'))but saw it had already been mentioned by Jason Orendorff in a comment.Reading Glenn Maynard\'s comment in the same answer suggesting list comprehensions over map I started to wonder why. I assumed he meant for performance reasons, but of course he might have meant for stylistic reasons, or something else (Glenn?).So a quick (possibly flawed?) test on my box applying the three methods in a loop revealed:making map(str.strip, string.split(\',\')) the winner, although it seems they are all in the same ballpark.Certainly though map (with or without a lambda) should not necessarily be ruled out for performance reasons, and for me it is at least as clear as a list comprehension.Edit:Python 2.6.5 on Ubuntu 10.04Just remove the white space from the string before you split it. this works fine for me.re (as in regular expressions) allows splitting on multiple characters at once:This doesn\'t work well for your example string, but works nicely for a comma-space separated list. For your example string, you can combine the re.split power to split on regex patterns to get a "split-on-this-or-that" effect.Unfortunately, that\'s ugly, but a filter will do the trick:Voila!Simply, comma or at least one white spaces with/without preceding/succeeding white spaces.Please try!map(lambda s: s.strip(), mylist) would be a little better than explicitly looping. Or for the whole thing at once: map(lambda s:s.strip(), string.split(\',\'))map(lambda s: s.strip(), mylist) would be a little better than explicitly looping.\nOr for the whole thing at once: That\'s basically everything you need.Remove the white space from the string and then you can split it.
