It seems like the only way to do this is to pass the -i parameter in when you initially run less. Does anyone know of some secret hack to make something like this workYou can also type command \'-i\' while less is running. It toggles case sensivity for searches.You can also set the environment variable LESSI use LESS=-Ri, so that I can pump colorized output from grep into it, and maintain the ANSI colour sequences.Another little used feature of less that I found is starting it with +F as an argument (or hitting SHIFT+F while in less). This causes it to follow the file you\'ve opened, in the same way that tail -f <file> will. Very handy if you\'re watching log files from an application, and are likely to want to page back up (if it\'s generating 100\'s of lines of logging every second, for instance).Add-on to what @Juha said: Actually -i turns on Case-insensitive with SmartCasing, i.e if you start your search with a uppercase then it performs case-sensitive, if not, it performs case-insensitive. Think of it as :set smartcase in Vim. E.g.: with -i, a search for \'log\' in \'Log,..\' will match, whereas \'Log\' in \'log,..\' will not match.When using -i flag, be sure to enter the search string completely in lower case, because if any letter is upper case, then its an exact match.See also:  the -I (capital i) flag of less(1) to change this behavior.It appears that you can summon this feature on a per search basis like so:
