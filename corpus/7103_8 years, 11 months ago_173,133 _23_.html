I know there are already a few questions regarding recomendations for c++ unit test frameworks, but all the answers did not help as they just recomend one of the frameworks but do not provide any information about a (feature) comparison.I think the most interesting frameworks are CppUnit, Boost and the new Google testing framework. Has anybody done any comparison yet?See this question for some discussion.They recommend the articles: \nExploring the C++ Unit Testing Framework Jungle, By Noel Llopis. \nAnd the more recent: C++ Test Unit FrameworksI have not found an article that compares googletest to the other frameworks yet.A new player is Google Test (also known as Google C++ Testing Framework) which is pretty nice though.Main features:I\'ve just pushed my own framework, CATCH, out there. It\'s still under development but I believe it already surpasses most other frameworks.\nDifferent people have different criteria but I\'ve tried to cover most ground without too many trade-offs.\nTake a look at my linked blog entry for a taster. My top five features are:It also has Objective-C bindings. The project is hosted on GithubBoost Test Library is a very good choice especially if you\'re already using Boost.It supports:PS: I wrote an article about it that may help you getting started: C++ Unit Testing Framework: A Boost Test Tutorial Wikipedia has a comprehensive list of unit testing frameworks, with tables that identify features supported or not.I\'ve recently released xUnit++, specifically as an alternative to Google Test and the Boost Test Library (view the comparisons). If you\'re familiar with xUnit.Net, you\'re ready for xUnit++.Main features:CppUTest - very nice, light weight framework with mock libraries. Worthwhile taking a closer look.CPUnit (http://cpunit.sourceforge.net) is a framework that is similar to Google Test, but which relies on less macos (asserts are functions), and where the macros are prefixed to avoid the usual macro pitfall. Tests look like:They auto-register, so you need not more than this. Then it is just compile and run. I find using this framework very much like using JUnit, for those who have had to spend some time programming Java. Very nice!There are some relevant C++ unit testing resources at\nhttp://www.progweap.com/resources.htmlAPI Sanity Checker \xe2\x80\x94 test framework for C/C++ libraries:An automatic generator of basic unit tests for a shared C/C++ library. It is able to generate reasonable (in most, but unfortunately not all, cases) input data for parameters and compose simple ("sanity" or "shallow"-quality) test cases for every function in the API through the analysis of declarations in header files.The quality of generated tests allows to check absence of critical errors in simple use cases. The tool is able to build and execute generated tests and detect crashes (segfaults), aborts, all kinds of emitted signals, non-zero program return code and program hanging. Unique features in comparison with CppUnit, Boost and Google Test:
