There is a file that was being tracked at one time by git, but now the file is on the .gitignore list.However, that file keeps showing up in git status after it\'s edited. How do you force git to completely forget about it?.gitignore will prevent untracked files from being added (without an add -f) to the set of files tracked by git, however git will continue to track any files that are already being tracked.To stop tracking a file you need to remove it from the index. This can be achieved with this command.The removal of the file from the head revision will happen on the next commit.The series of commands below will remove all of the items from the Git Index (not from the working directory or local repo), and then updates the Git Index, while respecting git ignores. PS. Index = CacheFirst:Then:Warning: This technique doesn\'t actually cause git to ignore the file, instead it actually causes git to delete the file.  That means if you use this solution, any time anyone else does a git pull, the file will get deleted.  So it isn\'t actually ignored.  See the solution suggesting git update-index --assume-unchanged instead for a solution to the original question.git update-index does the job for me:Note: This solution is actually independent on .gitignore as gitignore is only for untracked files.This takes the list of the ignored files and removes them from the index, then commits the changes.If you cannot git rm a tracked file because other people might need it (warning, even if you git rm --cached, when someone else gets this change, their files will be deleted in their filesystem) please look at https://gist.github.com/1423106 for ways people have worked around the problem. I always use this command to remove those untracked files. \nOne-line, Unix-style, clean output:It lists all your ignored files, replace every output line with a quoted line instead to handle paths with spaces inside, and pass everything to git rm -r --cached to remove the paths/files/dirs from the index.move it out, commit, then move it back in. This has worked for me in the past. There is probably a \'gittier\' way to accomplish this.(Under Linux), I wanted to use the posts here suggesting the ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard | xargs git rm -r --cached approach.  However, (some of) the files to be removed had an embedded newline/LF/\\n in their names.  Neither of the solutions:cope with this situation (get errors about files not found).This uses the -z argument to ls-files, and the -0 argument to xargs to cater safely/correctly for "nasty" characters in filenames.In the manual page git-ls-files(1), it states:When -z option is not used, TAB, LF, and backslash characters in\n  pathnames are represented as \\t, \\n, and \\\\, respectively.so I think my solution is needed if filenames have any of these characters in them.I accomplished this by using git filter-branch. The exact command I used was taken from the man page:WARNING: this will delete the file from your entire historyThis command will recreate the entire commit history, executing git rm before each commit and so will get rid of the specified file. Don\'t forget to back it up before running the command as it will be lost.Update your .gitignore file \xe2\x80\x93 for instance, add a folder you don\'t want to track to .gitignore.git rm -r --cached . \xe2\x80\x93 Remove all tracked files, including wanted and unwanted. Your code will be safe as long as you have saved locally.git add . \xe2\x80\x93 All files will be added back in, except those in .gitignore.Hat tip to @AkiraYamamoto for pointing us in the right direction.I think, that maybe git can\'t totally forget about file because of its conception (section "Snapshots, Not Differences").This problem is absent, for example, when using CVS. CVS stores information as a list of file-based changes. Information for CVS is a set of files and the changes made to each file over time.But in Git every time you commit, or save the state of your project, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. So, if you added file once, it will always be present  in that snapshot.These 2 articles were helpful for me:git assume-unchanged vs skip-worktree\n and How to ignore changes in tracked files with GitBasing on it I do the following, if file is already tracked:From this moment all local changes in this file will be ignored and will not go to remote. If file is changed on remote, conflict will occure, when git pull. Stash won\'t work. To resolve it, copy file content to the safe place and follow these steps:File content will be replaced by the remote content. Paste your changes from safe place to file and perform again:If everyone, who works with project, will perform git update-index --skip-worktree <file>, problems with pull should be absent. This solution is OK for configurations files, when every developer has their own project configuration.It is not very convenient to do this every time, when file has been changed on remote, but can protect it from overwriting by remote content.Move or copy the file to a safe location, so you don\'t lose it. Then git rm the file and commit. The file will still show up if you revert to one of those earlier commits, or another branch where it has not been removed. However, in all future commits, you will not see the file again. If the file is in the git ignore, then you can move it back into the folder, and git won\'t see it.The answer from Matt Fear was the most effective IMHO. The following is just a PowerShell script for those in windows to only remove files from their git repo that matches their exclusion list.The BFG is specifically designed for removing unwanted data like big files or passwords from Git repos, so it has a simple flag that will remove any large historical (not-in-your-current-commit) files: \'--strip-blobs-bigger-than\'If you\'d like to specify files by name, you can do that too:The BFG is 10-1000x faster than git filter-branch, and generally much easier to use - check the full usage instructions and examples for more details.Source: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/reduce-repository-size-321848262.htmlOn mac:1.
