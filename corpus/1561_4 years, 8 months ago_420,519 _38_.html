I have written a filter function which will return data based on the argument you are passing. I want the same functionality in my controller. Is it possible to reuse the filter function in a controller? This is what I\'ve tried so far:Inject $filter to your controllerThen wherever you want to use that filter, just use it like this:If you want to pass arguments to that filter, do it using separate parentheses:Where arg1 is the array you want to filter on and arg2 is the object used to filter.Answer provided by @Prashanth is correct, but there is even easier way of doing the same. Basically instead of injecting the $filter dependency and using awkward syntax of invoking it ($filter(\'filtername\')(arg1,arg2);) one can inject dependency being: filter name plus the Filter suffix. Taking example from the question one could write:It should be noted that you must append Filter to the filter name, no matter what naming convention you\'re using:\nfoo       is referenced by calling fooFilter\nfooFilter is referenced by calling fooFilterFilterUsing following sample code we can filter array in angular controller by name. this is based on following description.\nhttp://docs.angularjs.org/guide/filterthis.filteredArray = filterFilter(this.array, {name:\'Igor\'});JS:HTMLHere\'s another example of using filter in an Angular controller:Simple, hey ?Let\'s assume you have the following simple filter, which converts a string to uppercase, with a parameter for the first character only.Directly through $filterNote: this gives you access to all your filters.Assign $filter to a variableThis option allows you to use the $filter like a function.Load only a specific FilterYou can load only a specific filter by appending the filter name with Filter.Which one you use comes to personal preference, but I recommend using the third, because it\'s the most readable option.The controller method 2nd argument name should be "$filter" then only the filter functionality will work with this example. In this example i have used the "lowercase" Filter.I have another example, that I made for my process:I get an Array with value-Description like thisin my Filters.js:Then, a test var (controller):AngularJs lets you to use filters inside template or inside Controller, Directive etc..in template you can use this syntaxand inside controller you can use injecting the $filter serviceIf you need more with Demo example here is a linkAngularJs filter examples and demoThere is another way to evaluate filters that mirrors the syntax from the views. The invocation is hairy but you could build a shortcut to it. I like that the syntax of the string is identical to what you\'d have in a view. Looks like this:It seems nobody has mentioned that you can use a function as arg2 in $filter(\'filtername\')(arg1,arg2);For example: Simple date example using $filter in a controller would be:As explained here - https://stackoverflow.com/a/20131782/262140
