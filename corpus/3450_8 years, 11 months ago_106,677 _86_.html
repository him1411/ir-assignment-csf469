When verbally talking about methods, I\'m never sure whether to use the word argument or parameter or something else. Either way the other people know what I mean, but what\'s correct, and what\'s the history of the terms?I\'m a C# programmer, but I also wonder whether people use different terms in different languages.For the record I\'m self-taught without a background in Computer Science. (Please don\'t tell me to read Code Complete because I\'m asking this for the benefit of other people who don\'t already have a copy of Steve McConnell\'s marvellous book.)The general consensus seems to be that it\'s OK to use these terms interchangeably in a team environment. Except perhaps when you\'re defining the precise terminology; then you can also use "formal argument/parameter" and "actual argument/parameter" to disambiguate.A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method\'s parameters.Parameter is variable in the declaration of function.Argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function.There is already a Wikipedia entry on the subject (see Parameter) that defines and distinguishes the terms parameter and argument. In short, a parameter is part of the function/procedure/method signature and an argument is the actual value supplied at run-time and/or call-site for the parameter. The Wikipedia article also states that the two terms are often used synonymously (especially when reasoning about code informally):Although parameters are also commonly\n  referred to as arguments, arguments\n  are more properly thought of as the\n  actual values or references assigned\n  to the parameter variables when the\n  subroutine is called at runtime.Given the following example function in C that adds two integers, x and y would be referred to as its parameters:At a call-site using add, such as the example shown below, 123 and 456 would be referred to as the arguments of the call.Also, some language specifications (or formal documentation) choose to use parameter or argument exclusively and use adjectives like formal and actual instead to disambiguate between the two cases. For example, C/C++ documentation often refers to function parameters as formal arguments and function call arguments as actual arguments. For an example, see \xe2\x80\x9cFormal and Actual Arguments\xe2\x80\x9d in the Visual C++ Language Reference. A parameter is something you have to fill in when you call a function. What you put in it is the argument. Simply set: the argument goes into the parameter, an argument is the value of the parameter.A bit more info on:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_science)#Parameters_and_argumentsThe use of the terms parameters and arguments have been misused somewhat among programmers and even authors. When dealing with methods, the term parameter is used to identify the placeholders in the method signature, whereas the term arguments are the actual values that you pass in to the method.MCSD Cerfification Toolkit (Exam 70-483) Programming in C#, 1st edition, Wrox, 2013Real-world case scenarioIn editing, I\'m often put off at how people forget: structure languages are based on natural languages. A "parameter" is a placeholder. They set the response format, in spoken language. By definition, it\'s party to the call, limiting the response.An "argument" is a position that is being considered. You argue your opinion: you consider an argument. The thematic role of an argument is agent.  The thematic role of parameter is recipient. Think of the argument as the male part, making the parameter the female part. The argument goes into the parameter. A parameter is usually used in definitions. An argument is usually used in invocations. Finish the sentence to make it less dissonant.(A) Speaking of a definition:(B) Speaking of an invocation:(A) (B) As you can imagine, after answering: in spoken language, these words will sometimes produce identical responses! So, as a rule: Usually if someone wants parameter information, they want to know more about the type, the variable name, etc. They may become confused if you only give example arguments. The terms are somewhat interchangeable. The distinction described in other answers is more properly expressed with the terms formal parameter for the name used inside the body of the function and parameter for the value supplied at the call site (formal argument and argument are also common).Also note that, in mathematics, the term argument is far more common and parameter usually means something quite different (though the parameter in a parametric equation is essentially the argument to two or more functions).Simple:This example might help.Or may be its even simpler to remember like this, in case of optional arguments for a method:parameter is the parameter, its value, "argument" is the argument :)Let\'s say you\'re an airline. You build an airplane. You install seats in it. Then, you fill the plane up with passengers and send it somewhere. The passengers (or rather, some spatio-temporally altered version thereof) disembark. Next day, you re-use the same plane, and same seats, but with different passengers this time. The plane is your function. The parameters are the seats. The arguments are the passengers that go in those seats. The parameters of a function/method describe to you the values that it uses to calculate its result.The arguments of a are the values assigned to these parameters during a particular call of the function/method.Or even simpler...Arguments in !Parameters out !An argument is an instantiation of a parameter.Ok let\'s be real: for all intents and purposes they are virtually the same thing..........ok but for the pedants there might be a technical difference.A "parameter" is a very general broad thing, but an argumet is a very specific thing. Great, thanks -- so that\'s really helpful. hmmm: perhaps an example is in order.A Simple ExplanationLet\'s take an example: I have a machine. Here\'s how it works: I put things into the machine at one end, and at the other end, a new "product" comes out of the machine. What goes into this machine? Anything. What comes out? Well a refined version of what goes in. e.g. I can put flour and sugar into one end of this machine, and out of the other comes: a cake. you get the idea.Now different machines have different rules. One particular machine may only accept petrol (unleaded) as an input. It can be said that these machines accept parameters of type: petrol.An exampleWhat then is an argument? An argument is a particular and specific example of what is put into the machine. Suppose my machine takes people as an input (people would be the parameter of this machine) and let\'s suppose this machine turns those people, into people who aren\'t mean people (what a wonderful machine!).What then is an argument? The argument will be the particular person who is actually put into the machine. e.g. if George Bush is put into the machine then the argument would be George Bush. If Kim Kardiashian was there then she would be an argument too. So the parameter would be people as an abstract concept, but the argument would always be a particular person with a particular name who is put into the machine.One more examplee.g. a method (i.e. a particular machine which turns inputs into outputs) may accept an integer as a parameter. Let\'s suppose the integer 5 is "passed into" the function (i.e. let\'s suppose that you put the number 5 into the machine). In this case the integer "5" would be the argument, and the "parameter" accepted by this method would be of type integer. That\'s the difference. Simple.I hope this helps. If you\'re confused just comment and i\'ll try and fix it up.Yes! Parameters and Arguments have different meanings, which can be easily explained as follows:Function Parameters are the names listed in the function definition.Function Arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.They both dont have much difference in usage in C, both the terms are used\nin practice.\n    Mostly arguments are often used with functions. The value passed with the function calling statement is called the argument, And the parameter would be the variable which copies the value in the function definition (called as formal parameter).    In the above code num1 and num2 are formal parameters and a and b are actual arguments.Oracle\'s Java tutorials define this distinction thusly:\n"Parameters refers to the list of variables in a method declaration. Arguments are the actual values that are passed in when the method is invoked. When you invoke a method, the arguments used must match the declaration\'s parameters in type and order."A more detailed discussion of parameters and arguments: \nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/arguments.htmlWhen we create the method (function) in Java, the method like this..data-type name of the method (data-type variable-name)In the parenthesis, these are the parameters, and when we call the method (function) we pass the value of this parameter, which are called the arguments.Parameters and ArgumentsAll the different terms that have to do with parameters and arguments\n  can be confusing. However, if you keep a few simple points in mind,\n  you will be able to easily handle these terms.Source: Absolute C++, Walter SavitchThat is,Logically speaking,we\'re actually talking about the same thing.\nBut I think a simple metaphor would be helpful to solve this dilemma. If the metaphors can be called various connection point we can equate them to plug points on a wall.\nIn this case we can consider parameters and arguments as follows;Parameters are the sockets of the plug-point which may take various different shapes. But only certain types of plugs fit them.\nArguments will be the actual plugs that would be plugged into the plug points/sockets to activate certain equipments.Always Remember that:-\nArguments are passed while parameters are recieved.Parameters are the variables received by a function.Hence they are visible in function declaration.They contain the variable name with their data type.\nArguments are actual values which are passed to another function. thats why we can see them in function call. They are just values without their datatype The formal parameters for a function are listed in the function declaration and are used in the body of the function definition. A formal parameter (of any sort) is a kind of blank or placeholder that is filled in with something when the function is called.An argument is something that is used to fill in a formal parameter. When you write down a function call, the arguments are listed in parentheses after the function name. When the function call is executed, the arguments are plugged in for the formal parameters.The terms call-by-value and call-by-reference refer to the mechanism that is used in the plugging-in process. In the call-by-value method only the value of the argument is used. In this call-by-value mechanism, the formal parameter is a local variable that is initialized to the value of the corresponding argument. In the call-by-reference mechanism the argument is a variable and the entire variable is used. In the call- by-reference mechanism the argument variable is substituted for the formal parameter so that any change that is made to the formal parameter is actually made to the argument variable.Parameters are variables that are used to store the data that\'s passed into a function for the function to use. Arguments are the actual data that\'s passed into a function when it is invoked:Argument passed to a function/method is stored in its parameter.Argument is available to use, while parameter is a blank to be filled in.
