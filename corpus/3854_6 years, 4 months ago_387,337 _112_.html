I\'m not sure why I\'m unable to checkout a branch that I had worked on earlier. See the commands below (note: co is an alias for checkout):I\'m not sure what it means, and I can\'t seem to find anything I can understand on Google. How do I checkout that branch, and what may I have done to break this?UPDATE:I found this post, and running git show-ref gives me:UPDATE on .git directory (user_controlled_site_layouts is in the refs/heads/feature folder):UPDATE on git show 3af84fcf1508c44013844dcd0998a14e61455034Try git fetch so that your local repository gets all the new info from github. It just takes the information about new branches and no actual code. After that the git checkout should work fine.I was getting following error when I tried to checkout new brancherror: pathspec \'BRANCH-NAME\' did not match any file(s) known to git.When I tried git checkout origin/<BRANCH-NAME> it went to detached HEAD (detached from origin/)Did following to resolve the issueI got this error for a branch that was remote and had no local tracking branch. Even though I\'m certain I\'ve checked out remote branches via a simplein the past, to get around this error I had toI have no idea what I did to get myself into that situation either.If you deleted a branch with git branch -D yourbranchname and pulled/cloned again your repo, you may need to create your local branch again. Try: Git Windows users beware - without the --icase-pathspecs or GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS = 1 env var setting, that git pathspecs will be case-sensitive, in which case is not the same as I got this when I did the following:When I tried to check in the directory, I got this error.To fix:I opened the repo in git extensions. I saw that the file (with the old name) was staged. But since it didnt exist anymore, it could not be committed.I simply unstaged this file. Then I re-added the file (this time correctly named) into git and committed without errors.On Windows OS by default git is instaled with This means that git repo files will be case insensitive, to change this you need to execute:you can find this configuration on .git\\config fileIf it happens on Windows, it is probably the filename case issue. I had this error today - I\'ve created new file, added to GIT, then I changed one letter in filename from lower to upper and then I couldn\'t to anything - commit, revert, delete file from repo. The only solution I found was changing the filename again back to exact same case when I added this file to GIT, then doing GIT revert to remove this file from GIT, then changing filename again as I want. After those changes I could commit to repo and then push without any problem.I got the same problem because I used git clone --depth=1, which implies --single-branch.Do a completed git clone will fix it.In my case I have TWO branch 1) master(which is for live server) 2) dev(test server). I had set multiple remote to push code on respective server. When I tried to switch branch I got the error like error: pathspec \'master\' did not match any file(s) known to git.You can see them by git remote -v.\nI had removed other remote except origin remote by git remote remove <remote-name>Then git fetchNow I am able to checkout branch by git checkout <branch-name>.In my case I had renamed a file changing the case of the file, i.e. \n  SomeFile.js -> someFile.jsI think that was related to the problem.  Doing a git fetch didn\'t fix the issue.I moved the files out of my project, did a fetch, and did a push without them.  Then I did a fetch, added them back, and did a push, and it worked.  I don\'t know if all those steps were needed, but it did ultimately work.None of these answers solved my issue:I was trying to go back and build the commit for Version object v2.0.1. Luckily, I got the idea to try the whole hash code and it worked ! Which means that I was using the wrong end of the hash code.As shown above, for partial hash codes, you must supply the front-end, not the back-end.in my case I enter submodule directory without doing So git was linked to the parent folder that indeed missed that branch.I had this problem today I was trying to git checkout foo and got error: pathspec \'foo\' did not match any file(s) known to git. It turns out I was in the wrong repo. So lesson learned: check which repo you\'re looking at before freaking out.If branch name and you dont have any uncommited file, then try thisI had the same issue.. I thought I had branch named foo when I try to:I was getting:Then I tried the full branch name:then worked for me.I was getting the same pathspec error on git-bash. I used Tortoise git on windows to switch/checkout the branch.This can be caused when upstream rewrites history.When this happens, I toss all affected repos, clone them fresh from upstream, and use \'git format-patch\' / \'git am\' to ferry any work in progress from old world to new.Happened to me after renaming an uncommitted file in Android Studio.Git seemed to have the old version in its repository, even if it didn\xc2\xb4t exist anymore.So I opened the Git GUI of TortoiseGit which showed me the exactly file which caused trouble.Afterwards I deleted the file from the repository withand the problem was goneI faced a similar issue. What led me into this trouble was:\nI had multiple remote branches and I deleted the folder that had the code.\nI did a get pull. : Then I added remote repository : Then I tried to change branch to some other branch say AAAA and I got errorAfter spending an hour I found a solution.\nI deleted the source folder again.\nThen I did a git pull :Then I changed branch before linking it to remote repository : then I added it to remote repositoryAfter this I can easily switch branches.\nAlthough this is not a standard way but it worked for me after I tried all of above options.I faced this problem last time, and the thing I have done is remove the folder (or source code) related to that branch.Ex: the branch origin/foo create folder foo at your local, so I just delete it and use git fetch $ checkout to get code back from remote.Or you can do it by create folder at local same as the branch you intended to checkout.Ex: create folder foo at local, after that, use Git command: git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/foo foo, that all. Use git pull to get code.I my case I run "git fetch" before "git branch ...:, but obtained the same error.\nThen I analyzed it and found error in my branch name. Fixed it and switch to branch successfully. I had made a silly mistake of not providing -m flag while committing (lol happens)Can you confirm that the following works:It could be the case that someone has rewritten the history and that this commit no longer exists (for whatever reason really).I got this in Github desk top after clicking "Update from..." when the wrong repo was selected. I then changed repo to the correct one but when I tried to remove changes I got this error. That\'s because these were new files in the repo I errantly selected but not in the one I wanted to update from.I simply changed the repo selector back to the one I incorrectly selected the first time then I was able to remove the changes.Then I changed the repo selector to the one I wanted.I had this problem when working with Git on Windows. In my case, it was a case issue.\nI had already added and committed a file to my repository and later changed only its case. \nTo solve the problem, I renamed the file to match the original case and rename it again with the git mv command. Appearently, this lets git track the rename.Note: I was using Cygwin.This happened to me as well on Windows on two local branches I created myself. \nOnce out of the branch, I was not able to checkout bugfix_#303_multiline_opmerkingen_not_displaying_correctly_in_viewer nor   bugfix_339_hidden_fields_still_validatedyou can see in the screenshot from Git bash below. When I tried using Git GUI, I wasn\'t even able to see the branches at all. However when I used Pycharms git tool, I saw this:So for some reason windows decided to add some indecipherable character to my branch names and that is the reason it didn\'t work. Renaming the branches in Pycharm did the trick, so guess this would work on other IDEs as well. One possible reason, If you are working on windows machine with MINGW*Check the branch name you want to checkout.Windows omits character \' from branch name while parsing command.for example : if you have a branch name like bugfix/some-\'branch\'-nameWhen you issue command : > git checkout bugfix/some-\'branch\'-name it will parse it as bugfix/some-branch-name, notice it omits \' character.To checkout this kind of branch name, add escape character while issuing command.Type : > git checkout bugfix/some-\\\'branch\\\'-nameIt shoud work then!!I encountered this same issue when I was first playing around with git. When attempting my first commit...I got the error mentioned by the OP...I thought I might have been confusing git by using a keyword in the commit message, so I tried a few other words and received the same error.Finally I used double-quotes in the message...This turned out to be successful...I have the same questions, and got some information from this link: git fetch doesn\'t fetch all branchesSo now, I may not sure how this situation happened, at least we can solve it:Step 1. Check your "remote.origin.fetch" setting, should be like this$ git config --get remote.origin.fetch+refs/heads/private_dev_branch:refs/remotes/origin/private_dev_branchStep 2. Change "remote.origin.fetch" to fetch everything$ git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"$ git config --get remote.origin.fetch+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*Then, you can try "git pull" (maybe "git fetch origin" also works but I didn\'t try) to get all the branch.
