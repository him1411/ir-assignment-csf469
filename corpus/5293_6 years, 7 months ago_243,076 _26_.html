This question already has an answer here:First of all, I made this with help from \nAndroid download binary file problems \nand Install Application programmatically on Android. Thanks guys!I want to make auto-update and auto-install at once. It is local so it\'s non-market application.Here is my code for it:My permissions are INTERNET, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, INSTALL_PACKAGES, and DELETE_PACKAGES.When Intent promptInstall is loaded, the app crashes =/So, am I missing permissions or is my code incorrect, or is there a better way to do this?I solved the problem. I made mistake in setData(Uri) and setType(String).That is correct now, my auto-update is working. Thanks for help. =) Edit 20.7.2016:After a long time, I had to use this way of updating again in another project. I encountered a number of problems with old solution. A lot of things have changed in that time, so I had to do this with a different approach. Here is the code:For ICS I\xc2\xb4ve implemented your code and made a class that extends AsyncTask. I hope you appreciate it! Thanks for your code and solution.To use it, in your main activity call by this way: This question is very helpfully BUT Don\'t forget to mount SD Card in your emulator, if you don\'t do this its doesn\'t work.I lose my time before discover this.Thank you for sharing this. I have it implemented and working. However: 1) I install ver 1 of my app (working no problem)\n2) I place ver 2 on the server. the app retrieves ver2 and saves to SD card and prompts user to install the new package ver2\n3) ver2 installs and works as expected\n4) Problem is, everytime the app starts it wants the user to re-install version 2 again.So I was thinking the solution was simply delete the APK on the sdcard, but them the Async task wil simply retrieve ver2 again for the server.So the only way to stop in from trying to install the v2 apk again is to remove from sdcard and from remote server.As you can imagine that is not really going to work since I will never know when all users have received the lastest version.Any help solving this is greatly appreciated.I IMPLEMENTED THE "ldmuniz" method listed above.NEW EDIT:  Was just thinking all me APK\'s are named the same. Should I be naming the myapk_v1.0xx.apk and and in that version proactivily set the remote path to look for v.2.0 whenever it is released?I tested the theory and it does SOLVE the issue.\nYou need to name your APK file file some sort of versioning, remembering to always set your NEXT release version # in your currently released app. Not ideal but functional.Is there a method to read remote APK\'s Android version as started in the Manifest,\nOr download the available APK file on the server and before prompting for the install do a version compare to see if the downloaded APK is = or < the currently installed version?Thanks again
