How do I check which version of jQuery is loaded on the client machine? The client may have jQuery loaded but I don\'t know how to check it. If they have it loaded how do I check the version and the prefix such as:You can just check if the jQuery object exists:jQuery().jquery has the version number.As for the prefix, jQuery should always work. If you want to use $ you can wrap your code to a function and pass jQuery to it as the parameter:\xe2\x80\xa6just because this method hasn\'t been mentioned so far - open the console and type:As @Juhana mentioned above $().jquery will return the version number.I have found this to be the shortest and simplest way to check if jQuery is loaded:This method is used by http://html5boilerplate.com and others.You should actually wrap this in a try/catch block for IE:My preference is:Result:jQuery 1.8.0 loaded If you get back a version number -- usually as a string -- then jQuery is loaded and that is what version you\'re working with. If not loaded then you should get back undefined or maybe even an error.Pretty old question and I\'ve seen a few people that have already mentioned my answer in comments. However, I find that sometimes great answers that are left as comments can go unnoticed; especially when there are a lot of comments to an answer you may find yourself digging through piles of them looking for a gem. Hopefully this helps someone out!.....
