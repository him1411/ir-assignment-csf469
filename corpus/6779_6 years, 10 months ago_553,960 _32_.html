I am successfully using this code to send  HTTP requests with some parameters via GET methodNow I may need to send the parameters (i.e. param1, param2, param3) via POST method because they are very long.\nI was thinking to add an extra parameter to that method (i.e. String httpMethod).How can I change the code above as little as possible to be able to send paramters either via GET or POST?I was hoping that changingtowould have done the trick, but the parameters are still sent via GET method.Has HttpURLConnection got any method that would help?\nIs there any helpful Java construct?Any help would be very much appreciated.In a GET request, the parameters are sent as part of the URL.In a POST request, the parameters are sent as a body of the request, after the headers.To do a POST with HttpURLConnection, you need to write the parameters to the connection after you have opened the connection.This code should get you started:Here is a simple example that submits a form then dumps the result page to System.out. Change the URL and the POST params as appropriate, of course:If you want the result as a String instead of directly printed out do:I couldn\'t get Alan\'s example to actually do the post, so I ended up with this:I find HttpURLConnection really cumbersome to use. And you have to write a lot of boilerplate, error prone code. I needed a lightweight wrapper for my Android projects and came out with a library which you can use as well: DavidWebb.The above example could be written like this:You can find a list of alternative libraries on the link provided.I see some other answers have given the alternative, I personally think that intuitively you\'re doing the right thing ;).  Sorry, at devoxx where several speakers have been ranting about this sort of thing.That\'s why I personally use Apache\'s HTTPClient/HttpCore libraries to do this sort of work, I find their API to be easier to use than Java\'s native HTTP support.  YMMV of course! I had the same issue. I wanted to send data via POST.\nI used the following code:I used Jsoup for parse:i have read above answers and have created a utility class to simplify HTTP request. i hope it will help you.Method CallUtility ClassTry this pattern:here i sent jsonobject as parameter //jsonobject={"name":"lucifer","pass":"abc"}//serverUrl = "http://192.168.100.12/testing" //host=192.168.100.12 Hello pls use this class to improve your post method I took Boann\'s answer and used it to create a more flexible query string builder that supports lists and arrays, just like php\'s http_build_query method:Appears that you also have to callconnection.getOutputStream() "at least once" (as well as setDoOutput(true)) for it to treat it as a POST.So the minimum required code is:You can even use "GET" style parameters in the urlString, surprisingly.  Though that might confuse things.
