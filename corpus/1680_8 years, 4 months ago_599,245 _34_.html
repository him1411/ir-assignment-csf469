I want to pull out duplicate records in a MySQL Database.  This can be done with:Which results in:I would like to pull it so that it shows each row that is a duplicate.  Something like:Any thoughts on how this can be done?  I\'m trying to avoid doing the first one then looking up the duplicates with a second query in the code.The key is to rewrite this query so that it can be used as a subquery.Why not just INNER JOIN the table with itself?A DISTINCT is needed if the address could exist more than two times.I tried the best answer chosen for this question, but it confused me somewhat. I actually needed that just on a single field from my table. The following example from this link worked out very well for me:This is the similar query you have asked for and its 200% working and easy too.\nEnjoy!!!Find duplicate users by email address with this query...we can found the duplicates depends on more then one fields also.For those cases you can use below format.Another solution would be to use table aliases, like so:All you\'re really doing in this case is taking the original list table, creating two pretend tables -- p1 and p2 -- out of that, and then performing a join on the address column (line 3). The 4th line makes sure that the same record doesn\'t show up multiple times in your set of results ("duplicate duplicates").Finding duplicate addresses is much more complex than it seems, especially if you require accuracy. A MySQL query is not enough in this case...I work at SmartyStreets, where we do address validation and de-duplication and other stuff, and I\'ve seen a lot of diverse challenges with similar problems.There are several third-party services which will flag duplicates in a list for you. Doing this solely with a MySQL subquery will not account for differences in address formats and standards. The USPS (for US address) has certain guidelines to make these standard, but only a handful of vendors are certified to perform such operations.So, I would recommend the best answer for you is to export the table into a CSV file, for instance, and submit it to a capable list processor. One such is LiveAddress which will have it done for you in a few seconds to a few minutes automatically. It will flag duplicate rows with a new field called "Duplicate" and a value of Y in it.This will select duplicates in one table pass, no subqueries.This query actially emulates ROW_NUMBER() present in Oracle and SQL ServerSee the article in my blog for details:Not going to be very efficient, but it should work:For your table it would be something likeThis query will give you all the distinct address entries in your list table... I am not sure how this will work if you have any primary key values for name, etc..Fastest duplicates removal queries procedure:Personally this query has solved my problem:What this script does is showing all the subscriber ID\'s that exists more than once into the table and the number of duplicates found.This are the table columns:Hope it will be helpful for you either!This also will show you how many duplicates have and will order the results without joinsReplace city with your Table.\nReplace name with your field namePowerlord answer is indeed the best and I would recommend one more change: use LIMIT to make sure db would not get overloaded:It is a good habit to use LIMIT if there is no WHERE and when making joins. Start with small value, check how heavy the query is and then increase the limit.select address from list where address = any (select address from (select address, count(id) cnt from list group by address having cnt > 1 ) as t1) order by addressthe inner sub-query returns rows with duplicate address then\nthe outer sub-query returns the address column for address with duplicates.\nthe outer sub-query must return only one column because it used as operand for the operator \'= any\'
