Does anybody know of an easy way of taking a date (e.g. Today) and going back X days?So, for example, if I want to calculate the date 5 days before today.Try something like this:Note that this modifies the date object and returns the time value of the updated date.It goes something like this:If you\'re performing lots of headachy date manipulation throughout your web application, DateJS will make your life much easier:http://simonwillison.net/2007/Dec/3/datejs/I noticed that the getDays+ X doesn\'t work over day/month boundaries. Using getTime works as long as your date is not before 1970.I made this prototype for Date so that I could pass negative values to subtract days and positive values to add days.So, to use it i can simply write:split your date into parts, then return a new Date with the adjusted valuesRemember that the months are zero based, but the days are not. ie new Date(2009, 1, 1) == 01 February 2009, new Date(2009, 1, 0) == 31 January 2009;get moment.js. All the cool kids use it. It has more formatting options, etc. WhereOptional! Convert to JS Date obj for Angular binding.Optional! FormatI like doing the maths in milliseconds. So use Date.now()and if you like it formattedNOTE: Date.now() doesn\'t work in older browsers (eg IE8 I think). Polyfill here.@socketpair pointed out my sloppiness. As s/he says "Some day in year have 23 hours, and some 25 due to timezone rules".To expand on that, the answer above will have daylightsaving inaccuracies in the case where you want to calculate the LOCAL day 5 days ago in a timezone with daylightsaving changes and you However, it works if you\'re doing your math all in UTC, egA. You want the UTC date 5 days ago from NOW (UTC)B. You start with a UTC base date other than "now", using Date.UTC()A few of the existing solutions were close, but not quite exactly what I wanted. This function works with both positive or negative values and handles boundary cases.The top answers led to a bug in my code where on the first of the month it would set a future date in the current month. Here is what I did,A easy way to manage dates is use Moment.jsYou can use add. ExampleDocs http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/I find a problem with the getDate()/setDate() method is that it too easily turns everything into milliseconds, and the syntax is sometimes hard for me to follow.Instead I like to work off the fact that 1 day = 86,400,000 milliseconds.So, for your particular question:Works like a charm.I use this method all the time for doing rolling 30/60/365 day calculations.You can easily extrapolate this to create units of time for months, years, etc.for me all the combinations worked fine with below code snipplet , \n the snippet is for Angular-2 implementation , \nif you need to add days , pass positive numberofDays , if you need to substract pass negative numberofDaysWhen setting the date, the date converts to milliseconds, so you need to convert it back to a date:This method also take into consideration, new year change etc.You can using Javascript.For PHP,Hope it will help you.I like the following because it is one line.  Not perfect with DST changes but usually good enough for my needs.it can give you only date like 2014-06-20.\nhope will help
