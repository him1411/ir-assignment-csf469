When I\'m running a simple Ruby script, what\'s the easiest way to dump an object\'s fields to the console? I\'m looking for something similar to PHP\'s print_r() that will work with arrays as well.Possibly:You might find a use for the methods method which returns an array of methods for an object. It\'s not the same as print_r, but still useful at times.The to_yaml method seems to be useful sometimes:returns(Does this depend on some YAML module being loaded? Or would that typically be available?)Ruby doc for p.p(*args) publicFor each object, directly writes obj.inspect followed\n  by a newline to the program\xe2\x80\x99s standard output.If you\'re looking for just the instance variables in the object, this might be useful:or as a one-liner for copy and pasting:puts foo.to_json might come in handy since the json module is loaded by defaultIf you want to print an already indented JSON:=> ["id", "name", "email", "created_at", "updated_at", "password_digest", "remember_token", "admin", "marketing_permissions", "terms_and_conditions", "disable", "black_list", "zero_cost", "password_reset_token", "password_reset_sent_at"]=> [1, "tom", "tom@tom.com", Tue, 02 Jun 2015 00:16:03 UTC +00:00, Tue, 02 Jun 2015 00:22:35 UTC +00:00, "$2a$10$gUTr3lpHzXvCDhVvizo8Gu/MxiTrazOWmOQqJXMW8gFLvwDftF9Lm", "2dd1829c9fb3af2a36a970acda0efe5c1d471199", true, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil] I came across this thread because I was looking for something similar. I like the responses and they gave me some ideas so I tested the .to_hash method and worked really well for the use case too. soo: object.to_hashHope this answer can help someone!
