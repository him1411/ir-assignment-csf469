Is there a Linux command that will list all available commands and aliases for this terminal session?As if you typed \'a\' and pressed tab, but for every letter of the alphabet.\nOr running \'alias\' but also returning commands.Why?  I\'d like to run the following and see if a command is available:You can use the bash(1) built-in compgenCheck the man page for other completions you can generate.To directly answer your question:should do what yout want.Add to .bashrcIf you also want aliases, then:There is thecommand which lists all aliases and commands in $PATH where mycommand is used. Can be used to check if the command exists in several variants. Other than that... There\'s probably some script around that parses $PATH and all aliases, but don\'t know about any such script.Use "which searchstr".  Returns either the path of the binary or the alias setup if it\'s an aliasEdit:\nIf you\'re looking for a list of aliases, you can use:Add that in to whichever PATH searching answer you like.  Assumes you\'re using bash..Try this script:It\'s useful to list the commands based on the keywords associated with the command.Use: man -k "your keyword"feel free to combine with:| grep "another word" for example, to find a text editor:\nman -k editor | grep textshortcut method to list out all commands.\nOpen terminal and press two times "tab" button.\nThats show all commands in terminalTry to press ALT-? (alt and question mark at the same time). Give it a second or two to build the list. It should work in bash.Here\'s a solution that gives you a list of all executables and aliases.  It\'s also portable to systems without xargs -d (e.g. Mac OS X), and properly handles paths with spaces in them.Usage: myscript.sh [grep-options] pattern, e.g. to find all commands that begin with ls, case-insensitive, do:For Mac users (find doesn\'t have -executable and xargs doesn\'t have -d):You can always to the following:The shell will execute command only if they are listed in the path env var anyway.it depends, by that I mean it depends on what shell you are using.  here are the constraints I see:I use ZSH so here is a zsh answer, it does the following 3 things:here it is:If you use zsh this should do it.The problem is that the tab-completion is searching your path, but all commands are not in your path. To find the commands in your path using bash you could do something like : for x in echo $PATH | cut -d":" -f1; do ls $x; doneHere\'s a function you can put in your bashrc file:Example usage:FYI: IFS is a variable that bash uses to split strings.Certainly there could be some better ways to do this.The others command didn\'t work for me on embedded systems, because they require bash or a more complete version of xargs.The following commands should work on any Unix-like system.List by folder :List all commands by nameAlternatively, you can get a convenient list of commands coupled with quick descriptions (as long as the command has a man page, which most do):Then you just grep it like you want.yields:The results don\'t appear to be sorted, so if you\'re looking for a long list, you can throw a | sort | into the middle, and then pipe that to a pager like less/more/most. ala:Which returns a sorted list of all commands that have "zip" in their name or their short description, and pumps that the "less" pager. (You could also replace "less" with $PAGER and use the default pager.)maybe i\'m misunderstanding but what if you press Escape until you got the Display All X possibilities ? Basic commands:$ touch :- user for create empty fileSyn:- touch filenameEx: touch rama$ls list of files and directories$ ls \xe2\x80\x93l Long listingFile type, permissions, link files, user(or)owner name, group name, file size, time stamp, file or dir name.\xe2\x80\x93 regular (or) normal filed directoryl link filels \xe2\x80\x93a : show the all (including hidden files)Hidden files and directories start with . (dot)find more commands @ http://k2schools.com/linux-commands/Just pressing 5 times Escape quickly (5 it was for me, maybe a little more spamming might be needed), you get in the GNOME terminal a list of all installed bash methods and symbols(!!!).Why don\'t you just type:In the terminal.The shell will say somehing like EDIT:Ok, I take the downvote, because the answer is stupid, I just want to know: What\'s wrong with this answer!!! The asker said: and see if a command is available.Typing the command will tell you if it is available!.Probably he/she meant "with out executing the command"  or "to include it in a script" but I cannot read his mind ( is not that I can\'t regularly it is just that he\'s wearing a \nmind reading deflector )in debian: ls /bin/ | grep "whatImSearchingFor"
