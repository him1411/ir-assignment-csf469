All I want to do is to check whether an element exists in the vector or not, so I can deal with each case.You can use std::find from <algorithm>:This returns a bool (true if present, false otherwise).  With your example:As others have said, use the STL find or find_if functions. But if you are searching in very large vectors and this impacts performance, you may want to sort your vector and then use the binary_search, lower_bound, or upper_bound algorithms.Use find from the algorithm header of stl.I\'ve illustrated its use with int type. You can use any type you like as long as you can compare for equality (overload == if you need to for your custom class).If your vector is not ordered, use the approach MSN suggested:If your vector is ordered, use binary_search method Brian Neal suggested:binary search yields O(log n) worst-case performance, which is way more efficient than the first approach. In order to use binary search, you may use qsort to sort the vector first to guarantee it is ordered.I use something like this......as that way it\'s actually clear and readable. \n(Obviously you can reuse the template in multiple places).Bear in mind that, if you\'re going to be doing a lot of lookups, there are STL containers that are better for that.  I don\'t know what your application is, but associative containers like std::map may be worth considering.std::vector is the container of choice unless you have a reason for another, and lookups by value can be such a reason.Use the STL find function.Keep in mind that there is also a find_if function, which you can use if your search is more complex, i.e. if you\'re not just looking for an element, but, for example, want see if there is an element that fulfills a certain condition, for example, a string that starts with "abc". (find_if would give you an iterator that points to the first such element).You can try this code:In C++11 you can use any_of. For example if it is a vector<string> v; then:Here\'s a function that will work for any Container:Note that you can get away with 1 template parameter because you can extract the value_type from the Container. You need the typename because Container::value_type is a dependent name.If you wanna find a string in a vector:You can use count too.\nIt will return the number of items present in a vector.Another sample using C++ operators.With boost you can use any_of_equal:You can use the find function, found in the std namespace, ie std::find. You pass the std::find function the begin and end iterator from the vector you want to search, along with the element you\'re looking for and compare the resulting iterator to the end of the vector to see if they match or not.You\'re also able to dereference that iterator and use it as normal, like any other iterator.
