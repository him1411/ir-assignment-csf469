If I run a server with the port 80, and I try to use xmlHTTPrequest i get this error: Error: listen EADDRINUSEWhy is it problem for nodejs, if I want to do a request, while I run a server on the port 80? For the webbrowsers it is not a problem: I can surf on the internet, while the server is running.The server is:And the request:EADDRINUSE means that the port number which listen() tries to bind the server to is already in use.So, in your case, there must be running a server on port 80 already.If you have another webserver running on this port you have to put node.js behind that server and proxy it through it.You should check for the listening event like this, to see if the server is really listening:What really helped for me was:But this will kill a system process.With you can check if it worked.The aforementioned killall -9 node, suggested by Patrick works as expected and solves the problem but you may want to read the edit part of this very answer about why kill -9 may not be the best way to do it. On top of that you might want to target a single process rather than blindly killing all active processes.In that case, first get the process ID (PID) of the process running on that port (say 8888):lsof -i tcp:8888\nThis will return something like:Then just do (ps - actually do not. Please keep reading below):kill -9 57385You can read a bit more about this here.EDIT: I was reading on a fairly related topic today and stumbled upon this interesting thread on why should i not kill -9 a process. Generally, you should use kill -15 before kill -9 to give the target process a chance to clean up after itself. (Processes can\'t catch or ignore SIGKILL, but they can and often do catch SIGTERM.) If you don\'t give the process a chance to finish what it\'s doing and clean up, it may leave corrupted files (or other state) around that it won\'t be able to understand once restarted.So, as stated you should better kill the above process with:kill -15 57385EDIT 2: As noted in a comment around here many times this error is a consequence of not exiting a process gracefully. That means, a lot of people exit a node command (or any other) using CTRL+Z. The correct way of stopping a running process is issuing the CTRL+C command which performs a clean exit.Exiting a process the right way will free up that port while shutting down. This will allow you to restart the process without going through the trouble of killing it yourself before being able to re-run it again. ** BEFORE DOWNVOTING - Please READ the answer. IT IS RELEVANT! If you are going to downvote this, leave a comment why you think it isn\'t relevant.Just a head\'s up, Skype will sometimes listen on port 80 and therefore cause this error if you try to listen on port 80 from Node.js or any other app.You can turn off that behaviour in Skype by accessing the options and clicking Advanced -> Connection -> Use port 80 (Untick this)You should try killing the process that is listening on port 80.Killall will kill all the node apps running. You might not want to do that. With this command you can kill only the one app that is listening on a known port.If using unix try this command: Another thing that can give this error, is two HTTP servers in the same node code. I was updating some Express 2 to Express 3 code, and had this...And, it triggered this error.pkill node before running your script should do the job.I have the same problem too,and I simply close the terminal and open a new terminal and run again. that works for me, some time just need to wait for a few second till it work again.But this works only on a developer machine instead of a server console..This error comes when you have any process running on a port on which you want to run your application.how to get which process running on that port=>\ncommand:\n sudo netstat -ap | grep :3000    output : you will get the process information which is using that porttcp        0      0 IPaddress:3000      :                     LISTEN      26869/node Now you can kill that process \nsudo kill -9 26869Error: listen EADDRINUSE means the port which you want to assign/bind to your application server is already in use. You can either assign another port to your application.Or if you want to assign the same port to the app. Then kill the application that is running at your desired port.For a node application what you can try is, find the process id for the node app by :After getting the process id, doI have seen this error before (in node) with http.client, and as I recall, the problem had to do with not initializing the httpClient or setting bad options in the httpClient creation and/or in the url request.On Debian i found out to run on port 80 you need to issue the command as root i.e I hope it helps While killing the NODE_PORT, it might kill your chrome process or anything that is listening to the same port, and that\'s annoying. This shell script may be helpful - in my case the port is 1337 but you can change it anytimeIn my case I use a web hosting but it\xc2\xb4s the same in local host, I used: for watch the node process then, the console shows the process with PID.\nfor kill the process you have to use this command:where PID is the process id from the command above.Two servers can not listen on same port, so check out if other server listening on same port, also check out for browser sync if its running on same portif you want to solve this$ node server events.js:141\n        throw er; // Unhandled \'error\' event\n        ^Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3000\n      at Object.exports._errnoException (util.js:907:11)\n      at exports._exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:930:20)\n      at Server._listen2 (net.js:1250:14)\n      at listen (net.js:1286:10)\n      at Server.listen (net.js:1382:5)\n      at EventEmitter.listen (C:\\sendbox\\mean\\node_modules\\express\\lib\\application .js:617:24)\n      at Object.

I had exited gracefully with Ctrl + C ,  but sometimes this does not kill it.   I don\'t want to change my port or reboot so this worked.  Hopefully it helps others.  Otherwise it is documentation for myself. In my case rebooting ubuntu was helpfull.
