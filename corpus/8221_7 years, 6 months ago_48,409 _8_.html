I can\'t really ever think of a time when I would use git merge rather than git rebase and not want to have a commit show up.  Is there any way to configure git to have fast forwarding off by default?  The fact that there\'s an --ff option would seem to imply that there\'s a way, but I can\'t seem to find it in the documentation.Yes, there is --no-ff. You can configure merge options per branch, e.g.adds the following to your $(REPO)/.git/config file:Footnote: speaking of my experience, I eventually found switching fast-forward to off was mostly helpful for git newcomers - however once the feel for workflows and concepts start to sink in you definitely want to avoid blurring your log graph with tons of pointless \'merged remote ..blarf\' type commits.It seems there is still a pending question in the thread: How to do it globally (i.e. for all branches) ? For the records, we can use the following:...to make it apply to all branches in the current repository. To make it apply to all branches in all repositories where someone has not run it without the --global option (local settings override global) run this:From the documentation (search for merge.ff):merge.ff\n  By default, git does not create an extra merge commit when merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to false, this variable tells git to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the --no-ff option from the command line). When set to only, only such fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving the --ff-only option from the command line).
