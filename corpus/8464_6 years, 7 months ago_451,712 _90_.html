I\'m getting the following error when I try to run a simple JSP program on Tomcat in Eclipse. Several ports (8005, 8080, 8009) required by Tomcat v6.0 Server at localhost are already in use. The server may already be running in another process, or a system process may be using the port. To start this server you will need to stop the other process or change the port number(s).How is this caused and how can I solve it?You\'ve another instance of Tomcat already running. You can confirm this by going to http://localhost:8080 in your webbrowser and check if you get the Tomcat default home page or a Tomcat-specific 404 error page. Both are equally valid evidence that Tomcat runs fine; if it didn\'t, then you would have gotten a browser specific HTTP connection timeout error message.You need to shutdown it. Go to /bin subfolder of the Tomcat installation folder and execute the shutdown.bat (Windows) or shutdown.sh (Unix) script. If in vain, close Eclipse and then open the task manager and kill all java and/or javaw processes. Or if you actually installed it as a Windows service for some reason (this is namely intented for production and is unhelpful when you\'re just developing), open the services manager (Start > Run > services.msc) and stop the Tomcat service. If necessary, uninstall the Windows service altogether. For development, just the ZIP file is sufficient.Or if your actual intent is to run two instances of Tomcat simultaneously, then you have to configure the second instance to listen on different ports. Consult the Tomcat documentation for more detail.If you are running on windows try this in the command line prompt:This will show all ports in use and the process id PID # of the process that is using that port.\nThen Ctrl+Alt+Del and open Task Manager to see which process is that.You can then choose either to close/stop it or configure your server to use another port.\nTo check if the new choosen port (let\'s say 8010) is available do this:If it does not return any lines then you are fine.To change the port go to the Server view, open server.xml and change the port there.\nMine has this entry:If you are on mac environment, here is what I did.Find the process id running on this port from terminal, eg, 8080:and kill it:If Eclipse says Several ports (8005, 8080, 8009) required by Tomcat v6.0 Server at localhost are already in useThis error comes because tomcat may be running in background so first stop that server..follow the below details.Solution is:Thanks!If you use Eclipse then double click on servers and double click on tomcat server then one file will open. In that file change HTTP port to some other port number and save(Ctrl+S) then again start the server.I have no another instance of Tomcat running ad no other process using "Tomcat port" (in my case, the 8088 port).\nEclipse send the same message on starting Tomcat:....The server may already be running in another process, or a system process may be using the port. To start this server you will need to stop the other process or change the port number(s).I solve the problem in this way:What I did after reading all the suggested answer and as I know my port was already in use. I double clicked on Tomcat under the Servers tab in eclipse and it opened overview information and then find port information. Just changed conflicting port as mine was 8009 port (error mentioned during starting the server). I have changed it to 8008 and it works fine. Give a try if the changed port would not be in use server will start.Step 1: netstat -a -o -n and it will bring up a network list,search for the local address like 127.0.0.1:8080 and note the PID (eq 3624)    Step2 : taskkill /F /PID 3624 . Run this command to kill that process.link to postSteps to free port which is already used to run tomcat server in EclipseFor example , suppose 8080 port is used , we need to make free 8080 to run tomcatStep 1:C:\\Users\\username>netstat -o -n -a | findstr 0.0:8080 TCP    0.0.0.0:3000      0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       3116Now , we can see that LISTENING port is 3116 for 8080 ,We need to kill 3116 nowStep 2:-C:\\Users\\username>taskkill /F /PID 3116Step 3:\nGo to Eclipse and start Server , it will run On Windows use command net stop tomcat7 for stopping the already running tomcat instance  and try running again in eclipse ....it works or u can change the port in server\'s XML if u just want to run on some other ports. Easy way to solve your problem:The server may already be running in another process, or a system process may be using the port. In order to kill that port, do the following:1) Download TCPView(only 285kb) from following link.http://technet.microsoft.com/en-in/sysinternals/bb897437.aspx2) Extract folder and start TCPView application.3) Right click on java.exe(because 8009,8005 ports are commonly used by java process) and select End Process option.this would stop another process easily.. NOTE: Running TOMCATPATH/bin/shutdown.bat may not shutdown Tomcat when it contains some demon or unmanaged \n      threads. In such cases TCPView works fine without any issues.If you are in Java EE prospective in Eclipse and trying to start the Tomcat Server in Eclipse in debug mode, then you will get such errors. You must switch to debug prospective in Eclipse. I have solved my problem like this. Sometimes if the ports are not freed even after attempting shutdown.bat what @BalusC suggested,you can kill the javaw process. Do following steps :Enter command ps. You may see a image as follows :\nSee the process number of process "javaw".The process number is the rightmost number in the columns, I have highlighted in the image process number of javaw for example. Enter command kill . javaw is killed and now you must be able to run the program.For windows users:Go to Task Manager directly with CTRL+SHIFT+ESC key combination.Kill the "java.exe" processes by right clicking and selecting "End Task".On Eclipse make a raw delete of Tomcat configuration folder under project "Servers".\nI tried it as last hope and it worked.In case of windows, I experienced a new stuff...\nstopping tomcat from /bin folder will immediately not releasing the port 8080. It takes around 5-10 mins to release the port. After 10 mins again if i try to run my project\nRun-> Run on server .. it allows to run. I\'m unsure whether my understanding is correct!Refer to the following blog "how to kill tomcat without have to restart your computer"http://stanicblog.blogspot.fr/2012/01/how-to-kill-apache-tomcat-without.htmlHope this will help someone in the future.The simpler fix that works for me is deleting my current deployed webapps from tomcat through the "Server" tab. Once I remove them the problem goes away. Simply re-deploy your project by going on Run As > Run on Server.It occurs when others in the project are also using the same port numbers as you are using!\ndouble click tomcat server, change port numbers to anything 8585 or whatever. The code will now begin to run!The problem often arises when Apache Tomcat fails to terminate, properly, even though a shutdown instruction was sent. In my case, using Tomcat 8, this happens with annoying regularity. Luckily, you can use Windows PowerShell and the netstat command to create a simple script to kill the process.The following PowerShell script will parse the output from netstat to find any process that is listening on 127.0.0.1:8005, extract its PID and then kill that process:If your server.xml configures Tomcat to use a different port or IP, edit the regular expression on the script\'s fourth line accordingly.Finally, I should point out that the situation is better on Linux because you can instruct Tomcat to save its PID to a file at startup-time and use a switch to force the shutdown, later - the shutdown script for \'nix systems already features the ability to kill the process and the sleuth-work with netstat is not required.How to kill a windows service using PID - Thankskill a Windows service that\'s stuck on stopping or startingHere\'s one more option to try if none of the efforts above helped. You might be using Eclipse from a Shared Drive (for eg, H:). If so, move/copy it the entire Eclipse directory to C: and try again.My Eclipse could not open ports for Tomcat server (with the above error), nor even connect to internet. I also tried another Tomcat plugin (Sysdeo) which failed to open the ports too.These are the options I tried:Check and Kill Other Tomcat InstancesChange Tomcat Ports in EclipseKill java.exe and javawSee my other answer for Eclipse not connecting to Internet (https://stackoverflow.com/a/37246087/4212710).Several ports (8005, 8080, 8009) required by Tomcat vX.X Server at localhost are already in useTo check whether another instance of Tomcat already running or some other process is using the ports you can use:netstat -b -a in command prompt for windows. This lists the ports in use and gives you the executable that\'s using each one. You need to be in the admin group to do this.You might get something like this:TCP   192.168.0.1:8009      192.168.0.1:0  LISTENING 196 [Tomcat7.exe]TCP   192.168.0.1:8080      192.168.0.1:0  LISTENING 196 [Tomcat7.exe]TCP   192.168.0.1:8005      192.168.0.1:0  LISTENING 196 [Tomcat7.exe]Open task manager Ctrl+Shift+Esc, and kill Tomcat7.exe or any other process using these ports.Your Tomcat is probably running already. That\'s why you have got an error. I\'ve had the same problem before. I solved it very simply:That\'s all.In windows OS do right click on task bar-->start task manager-->process then check java.exe or javaw is running if it is running,then click on it and do end process then restart your tom cat server.
