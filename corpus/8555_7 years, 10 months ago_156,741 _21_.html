How do you check that an element is in a set?Is there a simpler equivalent of the following code:The typical way to check for existence in many STL containers is:Another way of simply telling if an element exists is to check the count()Most of the times, however, I find myself needing access to the element wherever I check for its existence. So I\'d have to find the iterator anyway. Then, of course, it\'s better to simply compare it to end too. Just to clarify, the reason why there is no member like contains() in these container types is because it would open you up to writing inefficient code. Such a method would probably just do a this->find(key) != this->end() internally, but consider what you do when the key is indeed present; in most cases you\'ll then want to get the element and do something with it. This means you\'d have to do a second find(), which is inefficient. It\'s better to use find directly, so you can cache your result, like so:Of course, if you don\'t care about efficiency, you can always roll your own, but in that case you probably shouldn\'t be using C++... ;)If you were going to add a contains function, it might look like this:This works with std::set, other STL containers, and even fixed-length arrays:As pointed out in the comments, I unintentionally used a function new to C++0x (std::begin and std::end). Here is the near-trivial implementation from VS2010:Write your own:You can also check whether an element is in set or not while inserting the element.\nThe single element version return a pair, with its member pair::first set to an iterator pointing to either the newly inserted element or to the equivalent element already in the set. The pair::second element in the pair is set to true if a new element was inserted or false if an equivalent element already existed.For example: Suppose the set already has 20 as an element.If the element is newly inserted than pair::first will point to the position of new element in set.I was able to write a general contains function for std::list and std::vector,This cleans up the syntax a bit.But I could not use template template parameter magic to make this work arbitrary stl containers.Any comments about improving the last answer would be nice.//general Syntax   /* in below code i am trying to find element 4 in and int set if it is present or not*/
