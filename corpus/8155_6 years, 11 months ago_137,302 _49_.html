I have implemented a ListView in my Android application.  I bind to this ListView using a custom subclass of the ArrayAdapter class.  Inside the overridden ArrayAdapter.getView(...) method, I assign an OnClickListener.  In the onClick method of the OnClickListener, I want to launch a new activity.  I get the exception:How can I get the Context that the ListView(the current Activity) is working under?Either Or as a last resort,_Edit - i would avoid setting flags as it will interfere with normal flow of event and history stack.I solved it with "addFlags" instead of "setFlags"According to the documentation it does:Add additional flags to the intent (or with existing flags value).EDITBe aware if you are using flags that you change history stack as Alex Volovoy\'s answer says:...avoid setting flags as it will interfere with normal flow of event and history stack.Instead of using (getApplicationContext) use YourActivity.thisI think maybe you are implementing the OnClickListener in the wrong place - usually you should definitely implement an OnItemClickListener in your Activity and set it on the ListView instead, or you will get problems with your events...If you got error because of using create chooser like below:Set the flag to create chooser like this :In addition: if you show links in listview in fragment, do not create it like thisinstead calladapter works fine in both cases, but links work only in last one.orchange to belowSee, if you are creating an intent within a listiner in some methodthen call the context through this view as well:There will not even need SetFlags ...For anybody getting this on Xamarin.Android (MonoDroid) even when StartActivity is called from activity - this is actually Xamarin bug with new ART runtime, see https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=17630In my opinion, it\'s better to use the method of startActivity() just in the your code of the Activity.class.  If you use that in the Adapter or other class, it will result in that.This error goes when startactivity doesn\'t know which is his activity. So you must add activity before startActivity()you must setElaborating Alex Volovoy\'s answer a little more -in case u are getting this problem with fragments, getActivity() works fine to get the contextIn Other Cases:If you don\'t want to use-then make a function like this in your OutsideClass -Now,in your main activity when ever you make a new OutsideClass call the above method immediately after you define the OutsideClass giving the activity\'s context as argument.\nAlso in your main activity make a function-now come back to your OutsideClass,and to start new activity do something like this-This way you will be able to start different activities called from different OutsideClass without messing up with flags. Note-Try not to cache context object via constructor for fragment(with adapter,its fine).A fragment should have a empty constructor otherwise application crashes in some scenarios.remember to call in the onResume() function as well.I also had the same problem. Check all the context that you have passed. For \'links\' it needs Activity Context not Application context. This are the place where you should check : 1.) If you used LayoutInflater then check what context you have passed.2.) If you are using any Adapter check what context you have passed.i hope this will work.I had the same problem. The problem is with context. If you want to open any links (for example share any link through chooser) pass activity context, not application context.Dont forget to add myIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK) if you are not in your activity.Faced the same issue then implemented  \nintent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);\n and got solved the problem.There may be an another reason which is related to list view adapter.\nyou can see This blog, described it very well.use this code. works fine for me;\nShare Something from Outside of an activity
