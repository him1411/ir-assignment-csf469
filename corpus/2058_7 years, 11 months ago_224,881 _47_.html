Is it possible to set multiple styles for different pieces of text inside a TextView?For instance, I am setting the text as follows:Is it possible to have a different style for each text element? E.g., line1 bold, word1 italic, etc.The developer guide\'s Common Tasks and How to Do Them in Android includes Selecting, Highlighting, or Styling Portions of Text:But that uses explicit position numbers inside the text. Is there a cleaner way to do this?In case, anyone is wondering how to do this, here\'s one way: (Thanks to Mark again!)For an unofficial list of tags supported by this method, refer to this link or this question: Which HTML tags are supported by Android TextView?Try Html.fromHtml(), and mark up your text with bold and italic HTML tags e.g:Slightly off-topic, but I found this too useful not to be mentioned here. What if we would like to read the the Html text from string.xml resource and thus make it easy to localize. CDATA make this possible:From our Java code we could now utilize it like this:I did not expect this to work. But it did. Hope it\'s useful to some of you!If you don\'t feel like using html, you could just create a styles.xml and use it like this:A really late response here but the list of supported tags is here: http://developer.android.com/guide/faq/commontasks.html#selectingtextIt also shows that Html.fromHtml isn\'t really neededIt is more light weight to use a SpannableString instead of html markup. It helps me to see visual examples so here is a supplemental answer.This is a single TextView.This example was originally inspired from here.I was running into the same problem. I could use fromHtml, but I am android now, not web, so I decided to try this out. I do have to localize this though so I gave it a shot using string replacement concept. I set the style on the TextView to be the main style, then just format the other peices.I hope this helps others looking to do the same thing - I don\'t know why this isn\'t easier in the framework.My strings look like this:Here are the styles:Here is my code that calls my formatStyles method:The format method:Now the <b> element is deprecated. <strong> renders as <b>, and <em> renders as <i>.this works fine for meIf you want to be able to add the styled text in xml you can create a custom view extending TextView and override setText():Then, you can use it like this (replace PACKAGE_NAME with your package name):Here is an easy way to do so using HTMLBuilderResult:Some bold text Some italic textAs stated, use TextView.setText(Html.fromHtml(String))And use these tags in your Html formatted string:http://commonsware.com/blog/Android/2010/05/26/html-tags-supported-by-textview.htmlIn fact, except the Html object, you also could use the Spannable type classes, e.g. TextAppearanceSpan or TypefaceSpan and SpannableString togather. Html class also uses these mechanisms. But with the Spannable type classes, you\'ve more freedom.It might be as simple as leveraging the String\'s length() method:Split the text string in the Strings XML file into as many sub-strings (a seperate strings from Android\'s point of view) as many you need different styles, so it could be like: str1, str2, str3 (as in your case), which when joined together are the whole single string you use.And then simply follow the "Span" method, just like you presented with your code - but instead of a single string, combine all the substrings merging them into a single one, each with a different custom style.You still use the numbers, however not directly - they\'re no more take a hardcoded form (as in your code) now, but they\'re being substituted with the combined length() methods (note two stars preceding and suffixing the str.length() in place of the absolute number to extuinguish the change):for the first string size, then str.length() + 1, str.length() + str2.length() for the second string size, and so on with all the substrings, instead of e.g. 0,7 or 8,19 and so on...Using an auxiliary Spannable Class as Android String Resources shares at the bottom of the webpage. You can approach this by creatingCharSquences and giving them a style.But in the example they give us, is just for bold, italic, and even colorize text. I needed to wrap several styles in aCharSequence in order to set them in a TextView. So to that Class (I named it CharSequenceStyles) I just added this function.And in the view I added this.I hope this help you!Spanny make SpannableString easier to use.
