I have a bitmap taken of a Base64 String from my remote database, (encodedImage is the string representing the image with Base64):profileImage is my ImageViewOk, but I have to resize this image before showing it on my ImageView of my layout. I have to resize it to 120x120.Can someone tell me the code to resize it?The examples I found could not be applied to a base64 string obtained bitmap.Change:To:EDIT: as suggested by by @aveschini, I have added bm.recycle(); for memory leaks. Please note that in case if you are using the previous object for some other purposes, then handle accordingly.If you already have a bitmap, you could use the following code to resize:Scale based on aspect ratio:To use height as base intead of width change to:Scale a bitmap with a target maximum size and width, while maintaining aspect ratio:try this this code : I hope it\'s useful.Someone asked how to keep aspect ratio in this situation:Calculate the factor you are using for scaling and use it for both dimensions.\nLet\xc2\xb4s say you want an image to be 20% of the screen in heightfor getting the screen resolution you have this solution:\nGet screen dimensions in pixelsTry this:\nThis function resizes a bitmap proportionally. When the last parameter is set to "X" the newDimensionXorY is treated as s new width and when set to "Y" a new height.As of API 19, Bitmap setWidth(int width) and setHeight(int height) exist.\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.html
