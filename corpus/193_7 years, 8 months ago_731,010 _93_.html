I\'d like to store a JavaScript object in HTML5 localStorage, but my object is apparently being converted to a string.I can store and retrieve primitive JavaScript types and arrays using localStorage, but objects don\'t seem to work.  Should they? Here\'s my code:The console output isIt looks to me like the setItem method is converting the input to a string before storing it.I see this behavior in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, so I assume it\'s my misunderstanding of the HTML5 Web Storage spec, not a browser-specific bug or limitation.I\'ve tried to make sense of the structured clone algorithm described in http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html.  I don\'t fully understand what it\'s saying, but maybe my problem has to do with my object\'s properties not being enumerable (???)  Is there an easy workaround?Update: The W3C eventually changed their minds about the structured-clone specification, and decided to change the spec to match the implementations.  See https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=12111. So this question is no longer 100% valid, but the answers still may be of interest.Looking at the Apple, Mozilla and Microsoft documentation, the functionality seems to be limited to handle only string key/value pairs.A workaround can be to stringify your object before storing it, and later parse it when you retrieve it:A little improve to Justin\'s variant:Because of short-circuit evaluation, getObject() will immediately return null if key is not in Storage. It also will not throw a SyntaxError exception if value is "" (the empty string; JSON.parse() cannot handle that).UPD. Added variable that Mark Storer mentioned in commentYou might find it useful to extend the Storage object with these handy methods:This way you get the functionality that you really wanted even though underneath the API only supports strings.Extending the Storage object is an awesome solution. For my API, I have created a facade for localStorage and then check if it is an object or not while setting and getting.There is a great library that wraps many solutions so it even supports older browsers called jStorageYou can set an objectAnd retrieve it easilyIt seems that the answers here don\'t cover all types that are possible in JavaScript, so here are some short examples on how to deal with them correctly: I do not recommend to store functions because eval() is evil can lead to issues regarding security, optimisation and debugging.\n        In general, eval() should never be used in JavaScript code.The problem with using JSON.stringify() for storing objects is, that this function can not serialise private members.\nThis issue can be solved by overwriting the .toString() method (which is called implicitly when storing data in web storage):Another problem stringify can\'t deal with are circular references:In this example, JSON.stringify() will throw a TypeError "Converting circular structure to JSON".\n        If storing circular references should be supported, the second parameter of JSON.stringify() might be used:However, finding an efficient solution for storing circular references highly depends on the tasks that need to be solved, and restoring such data is not trivial either.There are already some question on SO dealing with this problem: Stringify (convert to JSON) a JavaScript object with circular referenceIn theory, it is possible to store objects with functions:However, Function serialization/deserialization is unreliable because it is implementation-dependent.Using JSON objects for local storage://SET//GET// Iteration of all local storage keys and values// DELETEYou could also override the default Storage setItem(key,value) and getItem(key) methods to handle objects/arrays like any other data type. That way, you can simply call localStorage.setItem(key,value) and localStorage.getItem(key) as you normally would.I haven\'t tested this extensively, but it has appeared to work without problems for a small project I\'ve been tinkering with.I arrived at this post after hitting on another post that has been closed as a duplicate of this - titled \'how to store an array in localstorage?\'.  Which is fine except neither thread actually provides a full answer as to how you can maintain an array in localStorage - however I have managed to craft a solution based on information contained in both threads.So if anyone else is wanting to be able to push/pop/shift items within an array, and they want that array stored in localStorage or indeed sessionStorage, here you go:example usage - storing simple strings in localStorage array:example usage - storing objects in sessionStorage array:common methods to manipulate arrays:Recommend using an abstraction library for many of the features discussed here as well as better compatibility. Lots of options:I\'ve modified one of top-voted answer a little. I\'m a fan of having single function instead of 2 if it\'s not needed.Also, if no value is set, it\'s returning null instead of false. false has some meaning, null does not.Improvement on @Guria \'s answer:Another option would be to use an existing plugin.For example persisto is an open source project that provides an easy interface to localStorage/sessionStorage and automates persistence for form fields (input, radio buttons, and checkboxes).(Disclaimer: I am the author.)You can use ejson to store the objects as strings.EJSON is an extension of JSON to support more types. It supports all JSON-safe types, as well as:All EJSON serializations are also valid JSON. For example an object with a date and a binary buffer would be serialized in EJSON as:Here is my localStorage wrapper using ejsonhttps://github.com/UziTech/storage.jsI added some types to my wrapper including regular expressions and functionshttp://rhaboo.org is a localStorage sugar layer that lets you write things like this:It doesn\'t use JSON.stringify/parse because that would be inaccurate and slow on big objects. Instead, each terminal value has its own localStorage entry.You can probably guess that I might have something to do with rhaboo ;-)Adrian.I made another minimalistic wrapper with only 20 lines of code to allow using it like it should:https://github.com/zevero/simpleWebstorageYou can use localDataStorage to transparently store javascript data types (Array, Boolean, Date, Float, Integer, String and Object). It also provides lightweight data obfuscation, automatically compresses strings, facilitates query by key (name) as well as query by (key) value, and helps to enforce segmented shared storage within the same domain by prefixing keys.[DISCLAIMER] I am the author of the utility [/DISCLAIMER]Examples:As you can see, the primitive values are respected.Here some extented version of the code posted by @danottIt\'ll also implement delete value from localstorage \nand shows how to adds a Getter and Setter layer so instead oflocalstorage.setItem(preview, true) you can writeconfig.preview = trueOkay here were go:Well you may strip the aliases part with .bind(...). However I just put it in since it\'s really good to know about this. I tooked me hours to find out why a simple get = localStorage.getItem; don\'t workI think to avoid those kind of problem on local, session, cookies you can use opendb library..Ex- In which you can solve this using this snippethttps://github.com/pankajbisht/openDB I made a thing that doesn\'t break the existing Storage objects, but creates a wrapper so you can do what you want. The result is a normal object, no methods, with access like any object.The thing I made.If you want 1 localStorage property to be magic:If you need several:Everything you do to prop, or the objects inside storage will be automatically saved into localStorage. You\'re always playing with a real object, so you can do stuff like this:And every new object inside a tracked object will be automatically tracked.The very big downside: it depends on Object.observe() so it has very limited browser support. And it doesn\'t look like it\'ll be coming for Firefox or Edge anytime soon.Look thisLet\'s say you have the following array called movies:Using the stringify function, your movies array can be turned into a string by using the following syntax:Notice that my data is being stored under the key called quentinTarantino.Retrieving Your DataTo convert from a string back to an object, use the JSON parse function:You can call all of the array methods on your movies2To store an object, you could make a letters that you can use to get an object from a string to an object (may not make sense). For exampleThis technique will cause some glitches if you use the letter that you used to split the object, and it\'s also very experimental.A small example of a library that use localStorage for keeping track of received messages from contacts:Loop throught localstorage
