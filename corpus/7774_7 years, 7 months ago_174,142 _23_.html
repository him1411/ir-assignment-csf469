I\'m trying to achieve the following programmatically (rather than declaratively via XML):In other words, how do I make the second TextView appear below the first one, but I want to do it in code:Thanks, TreeUK. I understand the general direction, but it still doesn\'t work - "B" overlaps "A". What am I doing wrong?From what I\'ve been able to piece together, you have to add the view using LayoutParams.All credit to sechastain, to relatively position your items programmatically you have to assign ids to them. Then addRule(RelativeLayout.RIGHT_OF, tv1.getId());Cut the long story short:\nWith relative layout you position elements inside the layout.create a new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(whatever... fill parent or wrap content, absolute numbers if you must, or reference to an XML resource)Add rules:\nRules refer to the parent or to other "brothers" in the hierarchy.Just apply the layout params: The most \'healthy\' way to do that is:Watch out: Don\'t change layout from the layout callbacks. It is tempting to do so because this is when views get their actual sizes. However, in that case, unexpected results are expected.Just spent 4 hours with this problem. Finally realized that you must not use zero as view id. You would think that it is allowed as NO_ID == -1, but things tend to go haywire if you give it to your view...call after Try:Tested on Android 22Source:Works with the default project generated by android create project .... GitHub repository with minimal build code.This approach with ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams worked for me:If you really want to layout manually, i\'d suggest not to use a standard layout at all. Do it all on your own, here a kotlin example:This might give you an idea how this could work
