I am trying to fix how python plots my data.Say and Then I would do:and the x axis\' ticks are plotted in intervals of 5. Is there a way to make it show intervals of 1?You could explicitly set where you want to tick marks with plt.xticks:For example,(np.arange was used rather than Python\'s range function just in case min(x) and max(x) are floats instead of ints.) The plt.plot (or ax.plot) function will automatically set default x and y limits. If you wish to keep those limits, and just change the stepsize of the tick marks, then you could use ax.get_xlim() to discover what limits Matplotlib has already set. The default tick formatter should do a decent job rounding the tick values to a sensible number of significant digits. However, if you wish to have more control over the format, you can define your own formatter. For example,Here\'s a runnable example:Another approach is to set the axis locator:There are several different types of locator depending upon your needs.I like this solution (from the Matplotlib Plotting Cookbook):This solution give you explicit control of the tick spacing via the number given to ticker.MultipleLocater(), allows automatic limit determination, and is easy to read later.In case anyone is interested in a general one-liner, simply get the current ticks and use it to set the new ticks by sampling every other tick.This is a bit hacky, but by far the cleanest/easiest to understand example that I\'ve found to do this. It\'s from an answer on SO here:Cleanest way to hide every nth tick label in matplotlib colorbar?Then you can loop over the labels setting them to visible or not depending on the density you want.edit: note that sometimes matplotlib sets labels == \'\', so it might look like a label is not present, when in fact it is and just isn\'t displaying anything. To make sure you\'re looping through actual visible labels, you could try:This is an old topic, but I stumble over this every now and then and made this function. It\'s very convenient:One caveat of controlling the ticks like this is that one does no longer enjoy the interactive automagic updating of max scale after an added line. Then doand run the resadjust function again.I developed an inelegant solution. Consider that we have the X axis and also a list of labels for each point in X.This worked for meif you want ticks between [1,5] (1 and 5 inclusive) then replace Here\'s a pure python implementation of the desired functionality that handles any numeric series (int or float) with positive, negative, or mixed values:Sample Output:And Sample Usage:
