I know how to use rpm to list the contents of a package (rpm -qpil package.rpm). However, this requires knowing the location of the .rpm file on the filesystem. A more elegant solution would be to use the package manager, which in my case is YUM. How can YUM be used to achieve this?There is a package called yum-utils that builds on YUM and contains a tool called repoquery that can do this.Combined into one example:On at least one RH system, with rpm v4.8.0, yum v3.2.29, and repoquery v0.0.11, repoquery -l rpm prints nothing.If you are having this issue, try adding the --installed flag: repoquery --installed -l rpm.To use dnf instead of yum-utils, use the following command:No need to install yum-utils, or to know the location of the rpm file.I don\'t think you can list the contents of a package using yum, but if you have the .rpm file on your local system (as will most likely be the case for all installed packages), you can use the rpm command to list the contents of that package like so:rpm -qlp /path/to/fileToList.rpmHope this helps!Yum doesn\'t have it\'s own package type. Yum operates and helps manage RPMs. So, you can use yum to list the available RPMs and then run the rpm -qlp command to see the contents of that package.There are several good answers here, so let me provide a terrible one:
