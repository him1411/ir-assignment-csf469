How can I get the first n characters of a string in PHP? What\'s the fastest way to trim a string to a specific number of characters, and append \'...\' if needed?Update:Based on suggestion for checking length (and also ensuring similar lengths on trimmed and untrimmed strings):So you will get a string of max 13 characters; either 13 (or less) normal characters or 10 characters followed by \'...\'Update 2:Or as function:Update 3:It\'s been a while since I wrote this answer and I don\'t actually use this code any more. I prefer this function which prevents breaking the string in the middle of a word using the wordwrap function:This has been built into PHP since version 4.0.6, I am surprised at the combination of the age of this question and the fact that no one has mentioned this in any of the answersfrom the docs: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mb-strimwidth.phpThe Multibyte extension can come in handy if you need control over the string charset.sometimes, you need to limit the string to the last complete word ie: you don\'t want the last word to be broken instead you stop with the second last word.eg: \nwe need to limit "This is my String" to 6 chars but instead of \'This i..." we want it to be \'This..."  ie we will skip that broken letters in the last word. phew, am bad at explaining, here is the code. The codeigniter framework contains a helper for this, called the "text helper". Here\'s some documentation from codeigniter\'s user guide that applies: http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/helpers/text_helper.html\n(just read the word_limiter and character_limiter sections).\nHere\'s two functions from it relevant to your question:AndIf you want to cut being careful to don\'t split words you can do the followingif $str is shorter than $n_chars returns it untouched.If $str is equal to $n_chars returns it as is as well.if $str is longer than $n_chars then it looks for the next space to cut or (if no more spaces till the end) $str gets cut rudely instead at $n_chars.NOTE: be aware that this method will remove all tags in case of HTML.Use substringhttp://php.net/manual/en/function.substr.phpThe function I used:See it in action.This is what i dowhere $num stands for number of chars, and $tt the string for manipulation.I developed a function for this useyou just call the function with string and limite\neg:str_short("hahahahahah",5);\nit will cut of your string and add "..." at the end\n :)To create within a function (for repeat usage) and dynamical limited length, use:It\'s best to abstract you\'re code like so (notice the limit is optional and defaults to 10):I\'m not sure if this is the fastest solution, but it looks like it is the shortest one:P.S. See some examples here https://stackoverflow.com/a/17852480/131337substr() would be best, you\'ll also want to check the length of the string firstwordwrap won\'t trim the string down, just split it up...$width = 10;or with wordwrap this solution will not cut words, it will add three dots after the first space.\nI edited @Raccoon29 solution and I replaced all functions with mb_ functions so that this will work for all languages such as arabic
