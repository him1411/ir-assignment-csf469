There are many ways to do this, one is rejectYou can also use reject!, which will modify cities in place. It will either return cities as its return value if it rejected something, or nil if no rejections are made. That can be a gotcha if you\'re not careful (thanks to ninja08 for pointing this out in the comments).In my project I use delete:When I want to tidy up an array like this I use:This will remove all blank or nil elements.Here is what works for me:output: This will remove both nil values and empty string ("") values.For example:Try this:Use reject:The reason you want to use blank? over empty? is that blank recognizes nil, empty strings, and white space.
