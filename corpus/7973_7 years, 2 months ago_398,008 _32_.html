I am trying to execute the following query:But this returns an error. Basically I don\'t want to insert a record if the \'name\' field of the record already exists in another record - how to check if the new name is unique?I\'m not actually suggesting that you do this, as the UNIQUE index as suggested by Piskvor and others is a far better way to do it, but you can actually do what you were attempting:Insert a record:Try to insert the same record again:Insert a different record:And so on...INSERT doesn\'t allow WHERE in the syntax.

So from the examples above I came to this combination... it\'s here just in case somebody would need it.Notice:\nI had to define name everywhere as MSSQL required it... MySQL works with * too.MySQL:\n    CREATE TABLE names (\n      OID int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n      name varchar(32) COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\n      PRIMARY KEY (OID),\n      UNIQUE KEY name_UNIQUE (name)\n    ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1;orMSSQL:\n    CREATE TABLE [names] (\n        [OID]  INT           IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL,\n        [name] NVARCHAR (32) NOT NULL,\n        PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([OID] ASC)\n    );\n    CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [Index_Names_Name] ON [names]([name] ASC);In Microsoft SQL Server, I can use an IF statement:
