I\'m switching from MySQL to PostgreSQL and was wondering how I can do autoincrement values. I saw in the PostgreSQL docs a datatype "serial", but I get syntax errors when using it (in v8.0).Yes, SERIAL is the equivalent function.SERIAL is just a create table time macro around sequences.  You can not alter SERIAL onto an existing column.You can use any other integer data type, such as smallint.Example :Better to use your own data type, rather than user serial data type.If you want to add sequence to id in the table which already exist you can use:  Whilst it looks like sequences are the equivalent to MySQL auto_increment, there are some subtle but important differences:The serial column gets incremented on failed queries. This leads to fragmentation from failed queries, not just row deletions. For example, run the following queries on your PostgreSQL database:You should get the following output:Notice how uid goes from 1 to 3 instead of 1 to 2.This still occurs if you were to manually create your own sequence with:If you wish to test how MySQL is different, run the following on a MySQL database:You should get the following with no fragementation:This was pointed out by @trev in a previous answer.To simulate this manually set the uid to 4 which will "clash" later.Table data:Run another insert: Table data:Now if you run another insert:It will fail with the following error message:ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "table1_pkey"\n  DETAIL:  Key (uid)=(5) already exists.In contrast, MySQL will handle this gracefully as shown below:Now insert another row without setting uidThe query doesn\'t fail, uid just jumps to 5:Testing was performed on MySQL 5.6.33, for Linux (x86_64) and PostgreSQL 9.4.9You have to be careful not to insert directly into your SERIAL or sequence field, otherwise your write will fail when the sequence reaches the inserted value:In the context of the asked question and in reply to the comment by @sereja1c, creating SERIAL implicitly creates sequences, so for the above example-CREATE TABLE would implicitly create sequence foo_id_seq for serial column foo.id. Hence, SERIAL [4 Bytes] is good for its ease of use unless you need a specific datatype for your id.
