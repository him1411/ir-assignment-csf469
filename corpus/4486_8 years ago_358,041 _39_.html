I\'m looking for a jQuery plugin that can get URL parameters, and support this search string without outputting the JavaScript error: "malformed URI sequence". If there isn\'t a jQuery plugin that supports this, I need to know how to modify it to support this.The value of the URL parameter, when decoded, should be:(the characters are Norwegian).I don\'t have access to the server, so I can\'t modify anything on it.Below is what I have created from the comments here, as well as fixing bugs not mentioned (such as actually returning null, and not \'null\'):What you really want is the jQuery URL Parser plugin. With this plugin, getting the value of a specific URL parameter (for the current URL) looks like this:If you want an object with parameter names as keys and parameter values as values, you\'d just call param() without an argument, like this:This library also works with other urls, not just the current one:Since this is an entire URL parsing library, you can also get other information from the URL, like the port specified, or the path, protocol etc:It has other features as well, check out its homepage for more docs and examples.Instead of writing your own URI parser for this specific purpose that kinda works in most cases, use an actual URI parser. Depending on the answer, code from other answers can return \'null\' instead of null, doesn\'t work with empty parameters (?foo=&bar=x), can\'t parse and return all parameters at once, repeats the work if you repeatedly query the URL for parameters etc. Use an actual URI parser, don\'t invent your own.For those averse to jQuery, there\'s a version of the plugin that\'s pure JS. If you don\'t know what the URL parameters will be and want to get an object with the keys and values that are in the parameters, you can use this:Calling getParameters() with a url like /posts?date=9/10/11&author=nilbus would return:I won\'t include the code here since it\'s even farther away from the question, but weareon.net posted a library that allows manipulation of the parameters in the URL too:You can use the browser native location.search property:But there are some jQuery plugins that can help you:Based on the 999\'s answer: Changes:Need to add the i parameter to make it case insensitive:For example , a function which returns value of any parameters variable.And this is how you can use this function assuming the URL is,"http://example.com/?technology=jquery&blog=jquerybyexample".So in above code variable "tech" will have "jQuery" as value and "blog" variable\'s will be "jquerybyexample".You should not use jQuery for something like this!\nThe modern way is to use small reusable modules through a package-manager like Bower.I\'ve created a tiny module that can parse the query string into an object. Use it like this:After reading all of the answers I ended up with this version with + a second function to use parameters as flagsThere\'s a lot of buggy code here and regex solutions are very slow. I found a solution that works up to 20x faster than the regex counterpart and is elegantly simple:Regex is not the be-all and end-all solution, for this type of problem simple string manipulation can work a huge amount more efficiently. Code source.getURLParameter(id) or getURLParameter(Id) Works the same : )jQuery code snippet to get the dynamic variables stored in the url as parameters and store them as JavaScript variables ready for use with your scripts:I created a simple function to get URL parameter in JavaScript from a URL like this:OUTPUT: 18 Just in case you guys have the url like  localhost/index.xsp?a=1#something and you need to get the param not the hash.Slight modification to the answer by @pauloppenheim , as it will not properly handle parameter names which can be a part of other parameter names.Eg: If you have "appenv" & "env" parameters, redeaing the value for "env" can pick-up "appenv" value.Fix:This may help.
