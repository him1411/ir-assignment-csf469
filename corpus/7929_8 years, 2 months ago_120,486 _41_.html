I\'d like to have iOS to open URLs from my domain (e.g. http://martijnthe.nl) with my app whenever the app is installed on the phone, and with Mobile Safari in case it is not.I read it is possible to create a unique protocol suffix for this and register it in the Info.plist, but Mobile Safari will give an error in case the app is not installed.What would be a workaround?One idea:1) Use http:// URLs that open in any desktop browser and render the service through the browser2) Check the User-Agent and in case it\'s Mobile Safari, open a myprotocol:// URL to (attempt) to open the iPhone app and have it open Mobile iTunes to the download of the app in case the attempt failsNot sure if this will work... suggestions? Thanks!I think the least intrusive way of doing this is as follows:The other option I\'ve played with but found a little clunky was to do the following in Javascript:It\'s quite possible to do this in JavaScript as long as your fallback is another applink. Building on Nathan\'s suggestion:Check out a live demo here.For iOS 6 devices, there is an option: Promoting Apps with Smart App BannersI found that the selected answer works for the browser apps but I was having issues with the code working in non browser apps that implement a UIWebView.The problem for me was a user on the Twitter app would click a link that would take them to my site through a UIWebView in the Twitter app. Then when they clicked a button from my site Twitter tries to be fancy and only complete the window.location if the site is reachable. So what happens is a UIAlertView pops up saying are you sure you want to continue and then immediately redirects to the App Store without a second popup.My solution involves iframes. This avoids the UIAlertView being presented allowing for a simple and elegant user experience.jQueryJavascriptEDIT:Add position absolute to the iframe so when inserted there isn\'t a random bit of whitespace at the bottom of the page.Also it\'s important to note that I have not found a need for this approach with Android. Using window.location.href should work fine.In iOS9 Apple finally introduced the possibility to register your app to handle certain http:// URLs: Universal Links.A very rough explanation of how it works:This is the cleanest way to do deep linking on iOS, unfortunately it works only in iOS9 and newer...BUILDING Again on Nathan and JB\'s Answer:How To Launch App From url w/o Extra Click\nIf you prefer a solution that does not include the interim step of clicking a link, the following can be used.   With this javascript, I was able to return a Httpresponse object from Django/Python that successfully launches an app if it is installed or alternatively launches the app store in the case of a time out.   Note I also needed to adjust the timeout period from 500 to 100 in order for this to work on an iPhone 4S.  Test and tweak to get it right for your situation.document.webkitHidden is to detect if your app is already invoked and current safari tab to going to the background, this code is from www.baidu.comIf you add an iframe on your web page with the src set to custom scheme for your App, iOS will automatically redirect to that location in the App. If the app is not installed, nothing will happen. This allows you to deep link into the App if it is installed, or redirect to the App Store if it is not installed.For example, if you have the twitter app installed, and navigate to a webpage containing the following markup, you would be immediately directed to the app.Here is a more thorough example that redirects to the App store if the App is not installed:You can\'t, as far as I know, make the entire OS understand an http:+domain URL. You can only register new schemes (I use x-darkslide: in my app).  If the app is installed, Mobile Safari will launch the app correctly.However, you would have to handle the case where the app isn\'t installed with a "Still here? Click this link to download the app from iTunes." in your web page.Heres a solution.Setup a boolean sitiation using blur and focusBind your link with a jquery click handler that calls something like this.if the app opens, we\'ll lose focus on the window and the timer ends. otherwise we get nothing and we load the usual facebook url.Check the User-Agent and in case it\'s\n  Mobile Safari, open a myprotocol://\n  URL to (attempt) to open the iPhone\n  app and have it open Mobile iTunes to\n  the download of the app in case the\n  attempt failsThis sounds a reasonable approach to me, but I don\'t think you\'ll be able to get it to open mobile itunes as a second resort. I think you\'ll have to pick one or the other - either redirect to your app or to itunes.i.e. if you redirect to myprotocol://, and the app isn\'t on the phone, you won\'t get a second chance to redirect to itunes. You could perhaps first redirect to an (iphone optimised) landing page and give the user the option to click through to your app, or to itunes to get the app if they don\'t have it? But, you\'ll be relying on the user to do the right thing there. (Edit: though you could set a cookie so that is a first-time thing only?)In seeking to fix the problem of pop-up, I discovered that Apple had a way around this concern.Indeed, when you click on this link, if you installed the application, it is rerouted to it; otherwise, you will be redirected to the webpage, without any pop-up.
