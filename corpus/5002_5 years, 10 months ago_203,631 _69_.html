I am using my new mac for the first time today. I am following the get started guide on the mongodb.org up until the step where one creates the /data/db directory. btw, I used the homebrew route. So I open a terminal, and I think I am at what you called the Home Directory, for when I do "ls", I see folders of Desktop Application Movies Music Pictures Documents and Library.So I did a first, it says permission denied. I kept trying different things for half and hour and finally :worked. and when I "ls", a directory of data and nested in it a db folder do exist.then I fire up mongod and it complains about not finding data/dbHave I done something wrong?Now I have done the and when I do a "ls" I do see the data dir and the db dir. inside the db dir though, there is absolutely nothing in it and when I now run mongodEDIT \nGetting error message forThanks, everyone!You created the directory in the wrong place/data/db means that it\'s directly under the \'/\' root directory, whereas you created \'data/db\' (without the leading /) probably just inside another directory, such as the \'/root\' homedirectory.You need to create this directory as rootEither you need to use sudo , e.g. sudo mkdir -p /data/dbOr you need to do su - to become superuser, and then create the directory with mkdir -p /data/dbNote: MongoDB also has an option where you can create the data directory in another location, but that\'s generally not a good idea, because it just slightly complicates things such as DB recovery, because you always have to specify the db-path manually.   I wouldn\'t recommend doing that.Edit:the error message you\'re getting is "Unable to create/open lock file: /data/db/mongod.lock errno:13 Permission denied". The directory you created doesn\'t seem to have the correct permissions and ownership --\n it needs to be writable by the user who runs the MongoDB process.To see the permissions and ownership of the \'/data/db/\' directory, do this:\n(this is what the permissions and ownership should look like)The left side \'drwxr-xr-x\' shows the permissions for the User, Group, and Others. \n\'mongod mongod\' shows who owns the directory, and which group that directory belongs to.\nBoth are called \'mongod\' in this case. If your \'/data/db\' directory doesn\'t have the permissions and ownership above, do this:First check what user and group your mongo user has:You should have an entry for mongod in /etc/passwd , as it\'s a daemon.You can also use the user-name and group-name, as follows:\n(they can be found in /etc/passwd and /etc/group )that should make it work..In the comments below, some people used this:or The disadvantage is that $USER is an account which has a login shell.\nDaemons should ideally not have a shell for security reasons, that\'s why you see /bin/false in the grep of the password file above.Check here to better understand the meaning of the directory permissions:http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtmlMaybe also check out one of the tutorials you can find via Google: "UNIX for beginners"After getting the same error as Nikchown: id -u: Invalid argumentI found out this apparently occurred from using the wrong type of quotation marks (should have been backquotes) Ubuntu ForumsInstead I just used sudo chown $USER /data/dbas an alternative and now mongod has the permissions it needs.This works for me, found in comments: Create the folder.Give yourself permission to the folder.Then you can run mongod without sudo. Works on OSX YosemiteInstalling through brew on Mac where YOUR_USER_NAME and staff is the groupTo fix that error on OS X, I restarted and stopped the service:\n\n$ brew services restart mongodb\n$ brew services stop mongodb\nThen I ran mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf, and the problem was gone.The error seemed to arise after upgrading the mongodb homebrew package.If you run mongo without arguments it\'s assume you are running on the production machine so it\'s use the default locations.for using your own database (dev or just a different one) : I got over this exact same problem by creating the /data/db folders with my window manager. I tried doing it though the terminal at first, and in order to create a folder in the root directory, I had to use sudo.I just went to the root directory using Finder and created a new folder using \'New Folder\'. Totally worked for me.Note: I\'m using OSX.Your command will have created the directory structure in the current folder, not the root directory of your computer (which is what the missing / is).The first command was right, but because you are trying to create a folder in /, which is a protected directory, you need to prefix it with sudo, which is short for "superuser do". You\'ll then be asked for your password.So the full command would be:You need to create /data/db ... that is a directory called /data/ in your root (i.e. /) and subfolder in there called /db/ ...You\'re getting permission errors becuase you need to use sudo to create a direcotry in your root dir in MacOS, sudo lets you run commands as an administrator.So, run this instead ...This will prompt you for a password, it\'s the same password you use to change system settings (that little dialog that opens when you try and change things in System Preferences for ecample), and likely the same as you use to login.Just a quick note:If you tried running mongod without changing the permissions first, you\'ll likely have a mongod.lock file (and some other files) in the /data/db directory.  Even after you change the permissions for the /data/db directory to give access to your $USER, you\'ll continue to get the "Unable to create/open lock file: /data/db/mongod.lock errno:13 Permission denied" error.  Run ls -al /data/db and you\'ll probably see that the permissions for the individual files are still set to root for user, not to your $USER. You should remove the mongod.lock file, and the others as well.  Then when you run mongod again, everything should work, and you can verify that the file permissions match the directory permissions by running ls -al again.You\'re trying to create a directory you don\'t have root access to.For testing mongodb, I just use a directory from my user directory like:This will make a mongo database in temp/ from your current working directoryType "id" on terminal to see the available user ids you can give,\nThen simply type "sudo chown -R idname /data/db"This worked out for me!\nHope this resolves your issue.In more current versions of MongoDB, I have 3.2.10, it is stored be default into /var/lib/mongodb
