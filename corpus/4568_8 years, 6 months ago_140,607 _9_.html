Is there to way write a T-SQL command to just make it sleep for a period of time?  I am writing a web service asynchronously and I want to be able to run some tests to see if the asynchronous pattern is really going to make it more scalable.  In order to "mock" an external service that is slow, I want to be able to call a SQL server with a script that runs slowly, but isn\'t actually processing a ton of stuff.look at the WAITFOR commandEg. This command allows you a high degree of precision but is only accurate within 10ms - 16ms on a typical machine as it relies on GetTickCount. So, for example, the call WAITFOR DELAY \'00:00:00:001\' is likely to result in no wait at all. I believe the maximum time this can wait for is 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds.Here\'s a Scalar-valued function to show it\'s use; the below function will take an integer parameter of seconds, which it then translates into HH:MM:SS and executes it using the EXEC sp_executesql @sqlcode command to query. Below function is for demonstration only, i know it\'s not fit for purpose really as a scalar-valued function! :-)IF you wish to delay longer than 24 hours, I suggest you use a @Days parameter to go for a number of days and wrap the function executable inside a loop... e.g..Here is a very simple piece of C# code to test the CommandTimeout with.\nIt creates a new command which will wait for 2 seconds.\nSet the CommandTimeout to 1 second and you will see an exception when running it.\nSetting the CommandTimeout to either 0 or something higher than 2 will run fine.\nBy the way, the default CommandTimeout is 30 seconds.You can also "WAITFOR" a "TIME":
