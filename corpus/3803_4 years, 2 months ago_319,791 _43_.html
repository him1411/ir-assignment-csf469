I have been confused over when to use these two parsing methods.After I echo my json_encoded data and retrieve it back via ajax, I often run into confusion about when I should use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse.I get [object,object] in my console.log when parsed and a JavaScript object when stringified.JSON.stringify turns a Javascript object into JSON text and stores that JSON text in a string.JSON.parse turns a string of JSON text into a Javascript object.JSON.parse() is for "parsing" something that was received as JSON.\nJSON.stringify() is to create a JSON string out of an object/array.They are the inverse of each other. JSON.stringify() serializes a JS object into a JSON string, whereas JSON.parse() will deserialize a JSON string into a JS object.Firstly, JSON.stringify() function converts a JavaScript value to a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) string. JSON.parse() function converts a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) string into an object. For more information about these two functions, please refer to the following links.https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc836459(v=vs.94).aspx\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc836466(v=vs.94).aspx Secondly, the following sample will be helpful for you to understand these two functions.They are the opposites of each other. JSON.stringify()JSON.stringify() serializes a JS object into a JSON string.JSON.parse() The JSON.parse() method parses a string as JSON, optionally transforming the value produced.//The output will be://For 1st Console is a String Like://For 2nd Console is a Object Like:JSON.stringify() Converts an object into a string.JSON.parse() Converts a JSON string into an object.The real confusion here is not about parse vs stringify, it\'s about the data type of the data parameter of the success callback.data can be either the raw response, i.e a string, or it can be an JavaScript object, as per the documentation:successType: Function( Anything data, String textStatus, jqXHR jqXHR ) A\n  function to be called if the request succeeds. The function gets\n  passed three arguments: The data returned from the server, formatted\n  according to the dataType parameter or the dataFilter callback\n  function, if specified;<..>And the dataType defaults to a setting of \'intelligent guess\'dataType (default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html))Type: String The type of data that you\'re expecting back from the\n  server. If none is specified, jQuery will try to infer it based on the\n  MIME type of the response (an XML MIME type will yield XML, in 1.4\n  JSON will yield a JavaScript object, in 1.4 script will execute the\n  script, and anything else will be returned as a string).They are the complete opposite of each other.JSON.parse() is used for parsing data that was received as JSON; it deserializes a JSON string into a JavaScript object.JSON.stringify() on the other hand is used to create a JSON string out of an object or array; it serializes a JavaScript object into a JSON string.JSON.stringify(obj [, replacer [, space]]) - Takes any serializable object and returns the JSON representation as a string.JSON.parse(string) - Takes a well formed JSON string and returns the corresponding JavaScript object.JSON.parse() - is used to convert String to Object.\nJSON.stringify() - is used to convert Object to String.You can refer this too...JSON.stringify(obj) - Takes any serializable object and returns the JSON representation as a string.JSON.parse(string) - Takes a well formed JSON string and returns the corresponding JavaScript object.Explanation: \n   JSON.stringify(obj [, replacer [, space]]);Replacer/Space - optional or takes integer value or you can call interger type return function.They are opposing each other.\nJSON.Stringify() converts JSON to string and JSON.Parse() parses a string into JSON.I don\'t know if it\'s been mentioned, but one of the uses of JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(myObject)) is to create a clone of the original object.This is handy when you want to mess with some data without affecting the original object.  Probably not the cleanest / fastest way but certainly the simplest for objects that aren\'t massively complex.JSON.stringify(write here variable name) : javascript object into json \ntext.JSON.parse(variable name): json text into javascript object convert.
