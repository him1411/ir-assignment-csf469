I wrote an Android application. Now, I want to make the device vibrate when a certain action occurs. How can I do this?Try:Note:Don\'t forget to include permission in AndroidManifest.xml file:  Before you start implementing any vibration code, you have to give your application the permission to vibrate:Make sure to include this line in your AndroidManifest.xml file.Most IDEs will do this for you, but here is the import statement if yours doesn\'t:Make sure this in the activity where you want the vibration to occur.In most circumstances, you\'ll be wanting to vibrate the device for a short, predetermined amount of time. You can achieve this by using the vibrate(long milliseconds) method. Here is a quick example:That\'s it, simple!It may be the case that you want the device to continue vibrating indefinitely. For this, we use the vibrate(long[] pattern, int repeat) method:When you\'re ready to stop the vibration, just call the cancel() method:If you want a more bespoke vibration, you can attempt to create your own vibration patterns:There are multiple SDKs that offer a more comprehensive range of haptic feedback. One that I use for special effects is Immersion\'s Haptic Development Platform for Android.If your device won\'t vibrate, first make sure that it can vibrate:Secondly, please ensure that you\'ve given your application the permission to vibrate! Refer back to the first point.I struggled understanding how to do this on my first implementation - make sure you have the following: 1) Your device supports vibration (my Samsung tablet did not work so I kept re-checking the code - the original code worked perfectly on my CM Touchpad2) You have declared  above the application level in your AndroidManifest.xml file to give the code permission to run.3) Have imported both of the following in to your MainActivity.java with the other imports:\nimport android.content.Context;\nimport android.os.Vibrator;4) Call your vibration (discussed extensively in this thread already)  - I did it in a separate function and call this in the code at other points - depending on what you want to use to call the vibration you may need an image (Android: long click on a button -> perform actions) or button listener, or a clickable object as defined in XML (Clickable image - android):Above answers are perfect. However I wanted to vibrate my app exactly twice on button click and this small information is missing here, hence posting for future readers like me. :)We have to follow as mentioned above and the only change will be in the vibrate pattern as below,This will exactly vibrate twice. As we already know 0 is for delay, 100 says vibrate for 100MS for the first time, next comes delay of 1000MS and post that vibrate again for 300MS.One can go on and on mentioning delay and vibration alternatively (e.g. 0, 100, 1000, 300, 1000, 300 for 3 vibrations and so on..) but remember @Dave\'s word use it responsibly. :)Also note here that the repeat parameter is set to -1 which means the vibration will happen exactly as mentioned in the pattern. :)Update 2017 vibrate(interval) method is deprecated with Android-O(API 8.0)To support all Android versions use this method.Note:- You need to request permission before calling this method in Android Marshmallow and higher otherwise the app will crash.should be added inside <manifest> tag and outside <application> tag.Above answer is very correct but I\'m giving an easy step to do it:And then in your xml file: That\'s the easiest way.I use the following utils method:Add the following permission to the AndroidManifest fileYou can use overloaded methods in case if you wish to use different types of vibrations (patterns / indefinite) as suggested above.
