How can I programmatically get the phone number of the device that is running my android app?Code:Required Permission:According to the highly upvoted comments, there are a few caveats to be aware of. This can return null or "" or even "???????", and it can return a stale phone number that is no longer valid. If you want something that uniquely identifies the device, you should use getDeviceId() instead.There is no guaranteed solution to this problem because the phone number is not physically stored on all SIM-cards, or broadcasted from the network to the phone. This is especially true in some countries which requires physical address verification, with number assignment only happening afterwards. Phone number assignment happens on the network - and can be changed without changing the SIM card or device (e.g. this is how porting is supported).I know it is pain, but most likely the best solution is just to ask the user to enter his/her phone number once and store it.There is actually an alternative solution you might want to consider, if you can\'t get it through telephony service. As of today, you can rely on another big application Whatsapp, using AccountManager. Millions of devices have this application installed and if you can\'t get the phone number via TelephonyManager, you may give this a shot.Permission:Code:Check actype for whatsapp accountOf course you may not get it if user did not install Whatsapp, but its worth to try anyway.\nAnd remember you should always ask user for confirmation.As posted in my earlier answerUse below code :In AndroidManifest.xml, give the following permission:But remember, this code does not always work, since Cell phone number is dependent on the SIM Card and the Network operator / Cell phone carrier.Also, try checking in Phone--> Settings --> About --> Phone Identity, If you are able to view the Number there, the probability of getting the phone number from above code is higher. If you are not able to view the phone number in the settings, then you won\'t be able to get via this code!Suggested Workaround:Do the above 4 steps as one time activity during the app\'s first launch. Later on, whenever phone number is required, use the value available in shared preference.Code taken from http://www.androidsnippets.com/get-my-phone-numberJust want to add a bit here to above explanations in the above answers. Which will save time for others as well.In my case this method didn\'t returned any mobile number, an empty string was returned. It was due to the case that I had ported my number on the new sim. So if I go into the Settings>About Phone>Status>My Phone Number it shows me "Unknown".Sometimes, below code returns null or blank string.With below permissionThere is another way you will be able to get your phone number, I haven\'t tested this on multiple devices but above code is not working every time.Try below code:You will need to add these two permissions.Hope this helps,\nThanks!This is a more simplified answer:TelephonyManager is not the right Solution,Because in some cases the number is not stored in the SIM, Due to my suggestion,You should use Shared Preference to store user\'s Phone number first time the application is open, and after that the number will used whenever you need in application.First of all getting users mobile number is against the Ethical policy, earlier it was possible but now as per my research there no solid solution available for this, By using some code it is possible to get mobile number but no guarantee may be it will work only in few device. After lot of research i found only three solution but they are not working in all device.There is the following reason why we are not getting.1.Android device and new Sim Card not storing mobile number if mobile number is not available in device and in sim then how it is possible to get number, if any old sim card having mobile number then using Telephony manager we can get the number other wise it will return the \xe2\x80\x9cnull\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c??????\xe2\x80\x9dNote:- I have tested this solution in following device Moto x, Samsung Tab 4, Samsung S4, Nexus 5 and Redmi 2 prime but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work every\n  time it return empty string so conclusion is it\'s uselessNote:- This is also not the guaranteed and efficient solution, I have tested this solution in many device but it worked only in Redmi 2 prime\n  which is dual sim device it gives me two mobile number first one is\n  correct but the second one is not belong to my second sim it belong to\n  my some old sim card which i am not using.Conclusion:- Android doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any guaranteed solution to get\n  user\'s mobile number programmatically.Suggestion:- 1. If you want to verify user\xe2\x80\x99s mobile number then ask to\n  user to provide his number, using otp you can can verify that.Although it\'s possible to have multiple voicemail accounts, when calling from your own number, carriers route you to voicemail. So, TelephonyManager.getVoiceMailNumber() or TelephonyManager.getCompleteVoiceMailNumber(), depending on the flavor you need.Hope this helps.Here is how you should do this post M world:Make sure you manifest requests permission to use READ_SMS statewhile working on a security app which needed to get the phone number of who so ever my phone might get into their hands, I had to do this;\n1. receive Boot completed and then try getting Line1_Number from telephonyManager which returns a string result.\n2. compare the String result with my own phone number and if they don\'t match or string returns null then,\n3. secretly send an SMS containing the string result plus a special sign to my office number.\n4. if message sending fails, start a service and keep trying after each hour until sent SMS pending intent returns successful.\nWith this steps I could get the number of the person using my lost phone. \nit doesn\'t matter if the person is charged.
