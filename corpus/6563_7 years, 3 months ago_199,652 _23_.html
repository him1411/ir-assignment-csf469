What\'s the easiest way to convert from a file: android.net.Uri to a File in Android?Tried the following but it doesn\'t work:What you want is...... and not...NOTE: url.toString() return a String in the format: "file:///mnt/sdcard/myPicture.jpg", whereas url.getPath() returns a String in the format: "/mnt/sdcard/myPicture.jpg",There is no "easy" way to do this. A Uri is not a File. A Uri does not have to represent a file on the filesystem that you can access. The Uri might point to content that is:You can use ContentResolver and openInputStream() to get an InputStream on the content represented by the Uri. You can create a FileOutputStream on some file that you control. And, you can use Java I/O to copy from the InputStream to the OutputStream, making your own copy of the content in a file that you control.EDIT: Sorry, I should have tested better before. This should work:URI is java.net.URI.After searching for a long time this is what worked for me:use    directly and copy the file. Also see: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.htmlNone of this works for me. I found this to be the working solution:I made this like the following way:So basically first I try to use a file i.e. picture taken by camera and saved on SD card. This don\'t work for image returned by:\nIntent photoPickerIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK);\nThat case there is a need to convert Uri to real path by getRealPathFromURI() function.\nSo the conclusion is that it depends on what type of Uri you want to convert to File.@CommonsWare explained all things quite well. And we really should use the solution he proposed. By the way, only information we could rely on when quering ContentResolver is a file\'s name and size as mentioned here:\nRetrieving File Information | Android developersAs you could see there is an interface OpenableColumns that contains only two fields: DISPLAY_NAME and SIZE.In my case I was need to retrieve EXIF information about a JPEG image and rotate it if needed before sending to a server. To do that I copied a file content into a temporary file using ContentResolver and openInputStream()For folks that are here looking for a solution for images in particular here it is.File imageToUpload  = new File(new URI(androidURI.toString())); works if this is a file u have created in the external storage.For example file:///storage/emulated/0/(some directory and file name)
