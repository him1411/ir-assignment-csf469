Is there a way to dump a NumPy array into a CSV file? I have a 2D NumPy array and need to dump it in human-readable format.numpy.savetxt saves an array to a text file.tofile is a convenient function to do this:The man page has some useful notes:This is a convenience function for quick storage of array data.\n  Information on endianness and precision is lost, so this method is not\n  a good choice for files intended to archive data or transport data\n  between machines with different endianness. Some of these problems can\n  be overcome by outputting the data as text files, at the expense of\n  speed and file size.Note. This fuction does not produce multi-line csv files, it saves everything to one line.It\'s easy and fast with pandasWriting record arrays as CSV files with headers requires a bit more work.This example reads a CSV file with the header on the first line, then writes the same file.Note that this example does not consider strings with commas. To consider quotes for non-numeric data, use the csv package:If you want to save your numpy array (e.g. your_array = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])) to one cell, you could convert it first with your_array.tolist().Then save it the normal way to one cell, with delimiter=\';\'\nand the cell in the csv-file will look like this [[1, 2], [2, 4]]Then you could restore your array like this:\nyour_array = np.array(ast.literal_eval(cell_string))if you want to write in column:Here \'a\' is the name of numpy array and \'file\' is the variable to write in a file.If you want to write in row:You can also do it with pure python without using any modules.
