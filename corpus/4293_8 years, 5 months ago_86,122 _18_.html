Learning Objective-C and reading sample code, I notice that objects are usually created using this method:instead of:Is there a reason for this, as I have read that they are equivalent?There are a bunch of reasons here: http://macresearch.org/difference-between-alloc-init-and-newSome selected ones are:General opinion seems to be that you should use whatever you\'re comfortable with.Very old question, but I\'ve written some example just for fun - maybe you\'ll find it useful ;)In main function both statements:and result in the same output:+new is equivalent to +alloc/-init in Apple\'s NSObject implementation. It is highly unlikely that this will ever change, but depending on your paranoia level, Apple\'s documentation for +new appears to allow for a change of implementation (and breaking the equivalency) in the future. For this reason, because "explicit is better than implicit" and for historical continuity, the Objective-C community generally avoids +new. You can, however, usually spot the recent Java comers to Objective-C by their dogged use of +new.Frequently, you are going to need to pass arguments to init and so you will be using a different method, such as [[SomeObject alloc] initWithString: @"Foo"]. If you\'re used to writing this, you get in the habit of doing it this way and so [[SomeObject alloc] init] may come more naturally that [SomeObject new].One Short Answere is:For a side note, I personally use [Foo new] if I want something in init to be done without using it\'s return value anywhere. If you do not use the return of [[Foo alloc] init] anywhere then you will get a warning. More or less, I use [Foo new] for eye candy.If new does the job for you, then it will make your code modestly smaller as well.  If you would otherwise call [[SomeClass alloc] init] in many different places in your code, you will create a Hot Spot in new\'s implementation - that is, in the objc runtime - that will reduce the number of your cache misses.In my understanding, if you need to use a custom initializer use [[SomeClass alloc] initCustom].If you don\'t, use [SomeClass new].I am very late to this but I want to mention that that new is actually unsafe in the Obj-C with Swift world. Swift will only create a default init method if you do not create any other initializer. Calling new on a swift class with a custom initializer will cause a crash. If you use alloc/init then the compiler will properly complain that init does not exist.
