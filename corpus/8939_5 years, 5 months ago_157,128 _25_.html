This often happens to me: I\'m working on a couple related changes at the same time over the course of a day or two, and when it\'s time to commit, I end up forgetting what changed in a specific file. (This is just a personal git repo, so I\'m ok with having more than one update in a commit.) Is there any way to preview the changes between my local file, which is about to be checked in, and the last commit for that file? Something like:And it would print out something like:This way, I could quickly see what I had done in that file since it was last checked in.If you want to see what you haven\'t git added yet:or if you want to see already-added changeswill show you changes you added to your worktree from the last commit. All the changes (staged or not staged) will be shown. I think this is the perfect use case warranting a GUI. - Although I totally understand that it can also be achieved well enough within the command line.Personally, every commit of mine, I do from the git-gui. In which I can make multiple atomic commits with separate hunks/lines if it makes sense to do so.Gut Gui enables viewing of the diffs in a well formatted colored interface, is rather light. Looks like this is something you should checkout too.Did you try -v (or --verbose) option for git commit? It adds the diff of the commit in the message editor.To check for local differences:or you can use a diff tool (in case you\'d like to revert some changes):To use git difftool more efficiently, install and use your favourite GUI tool such as Meld, DiffMerge or OpenDiff.Note: You can also use . (instead of filename) to see current dir changes.In order to check changes per each line, use: git blame which will display which line was commited in which commit.To view the actual file before the commit (where master is your branch), run:Another technique to consider if you want to compare a file to the last commit which is more pedantic:The advantage with this technique is you can also compare to the penultimate commit with:and the one before that:Also you can substitute \'~\' for the caret \'^\' character and \'you branch name\' for \'master\' if you are not on the master branch.Go to the git root directory and enter git diff *The best way I found, aside of using a dedicated commit GUI, is to use git difftool -d - This opens your diff tool in directory comparison mode, comparing HEAD with current dirty folder.
