I have a problem, when submitting a form all active ajax request fail, and that triggers error event.How to stop all active ajax requests in jQuery without trigerring error event?Every time you create an ajax request you could use a variable to store it:Then you can abort the request:You could use an array keeping track of all pending ajax requests and abort them if necessary.The following snippet allows you to maintain a list (pool) of request and abort them all if needed. Best to place in the <HEAD> of your html, before any other AJAX calls are made.Using ajaxSetup is not correct, as is noted on its doc page. It only sets up defaults, and if some requests override them there will be a mess.I am way late to the party, but just for future reference if someone is looking for a solution to the same problem, here is my go at it, inspired by and largely identical to the previous answers, but more completeHere\'s what I\'m currently using to accomplish that.Note: _.each of underscore.js is present, but obviously not necessary.  I\'m just lazy and I don\'t want to change it to $.each().  8PGive each xhr request a unique id and store the object reference in an object before sending.\nDelete the reference after an xhr request completes.To cancel all request any time:Returns the unique ids of canceled request. Only for testing purposes. Working function:Returns an object with single function which can be used to add more functionality when required.I found it too easy for multiple requests.step1: define a variable at top of page: step2: set beforeSend in all ajax requests: step3: use it whereever you required: I had some problems with andy\'s code, but it gave me some great ideas.  First problem was that we should pop off any jqXHR objects that successfully complete.  I also had to modify the abortAll function. Here is my final working code:I didn\'t like the ajaxComplete() way of doing things. No matter how I tried to configure .ajaxSetup it did not work.I extended mkmurray and SpYk3HH answer above so that xhrPool.abortAll can abort all pending requests of a given url :Usage is same except that abortAll can now optionally accept a url as a parameter and will cancel only pending calls to that urlI have updated the code to make it works for meThrowing my hat in. Offers abort and remove methods against the xhrPool array, and is not prone to issues with ajaxSetup overrides. Just as important: say you want to log off and you are generating new requests with timers: because session data is renewed with each new bootstrap (maybe you can tell I am talking Drupal, but this could be any site that uses sessions)... I had to go through all my scripts with a search and replace, cause I had a ton of stuff running in different cases: global variables at the top: Better to use independent code.....Make a pool of all ajax request and abort them.....Here\'s how to hook this up on any click (useful if your page is placing many AJAX calls and you\'re trying to navigate away).
