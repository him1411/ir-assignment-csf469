This is the PATH variable without sudo:This is the PATH variable with sudo:As far as I can tell, sudo is supposed to leave PATH untouched. What\'s going on? How do I change this? (This is on Ubuntu 8.04).UPDATE: as far as I can see, none of the scripts started as root change PATH in any way.From man sudo: To prevent command spoofing, sudo\n  checks ``.\'\' and ``\'\' (both denoting\n  current directory) last when searching\n  for a command in the user\'s PATH (if\n  one or both are in the PATH). Note,\n  however, that the actual PATH\n  environment variable is not modified\n  and is passed unchanged to the program\n  that sudo executes.This is an annoying function a feature of sudo on ubuntu.\nNote this doesn\'t happen on fedora for example\nas sudo is not built with the --with-secure-path option there.To work around this "problem" on ubuntu I do\nthe following in my ~/.bashrcNote the above will work for commands that don\'t reset the $PATH themselves.\nHowever `su\' resets it\'s $PATH so you must use -p to tell it not to. I.E.:In case someone else runs accross this and wants to just disable all path variable changing for all users.\nAccess your sudoers file by using the command:visudo.  You should see the following line somewhere:  Defaults        env_resetwhich you should add the following on the next lineDefaults        !secure_pathsecure_path is enabled by default.  This option specifies what to make $PATH when sudoing.  The exclamation mark disables the feature.PATH is an environment variable, and as such is by default reset by sudo.You need special permissions to be permitted to do this. From man sudoAn Example of usage: \nSo may need to check that this is/is not compiled in. It is by default in GentooLooks like this bug has been around for quite a while! Here are some bug references you may find helpful (and may want to subscribe to / vote up, hint, hint...):Debian bug #85123 ("sudo: SECURE_PATH still can\'t be overridden") (from 2001!)It seems that Bug#20996 is still present in this version of sudo.  The\n  changelog says that it can be overridden at runtime but I haven\'t yet\n  discovered how.They mention putting something like this in your sudoers file:but when I do that in Ubuntu 8.10 at least, it gives me this error:Ubuntu bug #50797 ("sudo built with --with-secure-path is problematic")Worse still, as far as I can tell, it\n  is impossible to respecify secure_path\n  in the sudoers file. So if, for\n  example, you want to offer your users\n  easy access to something under /opt,\n  you must recompile sudo.Yes. There needs to be a way to\n  override this "feature" without having\n  to recompile. Nothing worse then\n  security bigots telling you what\'s\n  best for your environment and then not\n  giving you a way to turn it off.This is really annoying. It might be\n  wise to keep current behavior by\n  default for security reasons, but\n  there should be a way of overriding it\n  other than recompiling from source\n  code! Many people ARE in need of PATH\n  inheritance. I wonder why no\n  maintainers look into it, which seems\n  easy to come up with an acceptable\n  solution.I worked around it like this:then create a file /usr/bin/sudo containing the following:then your regular sudo works just like the non secure-path sudoUbuntu bug #192651 ("sudo path is always reset")Given that a duplicate of this bug was\n  originally filed in July 2006, I\'m not\n  clear how long an ineffectual env_keep\n  has been in operation. Whatever the\n  merits of forcing users to employ\n  tricks such as that listed above,\n  surely the man pages for sudo and\n  sudoers should reflect the fact that\n  options to modify the PATH are\n  effectively redundant.Modifying documentation to reflect\n  actual execution is non destabilising\n  and very helpful.Ubuntu bug #226595 ("impossible to retain/specify PATH")I need to be able to run sudo with\n  additional non-std binary folders in\n  the PATH. Having already added my\n  requirements to /etc/environment I was\n  surprised when I got errors about\n  missing commands when running them\n  under sudo.....I tried the following to fix this\n  without sucess: Using the "sudo -E" option - did not work. My existing PATH was still reset by sudo Changing "Defaults env_reset" to "Defaults !env_reset" in /etc/sudoers -- also did not work (even when combined with sudo -E) Uncommenting env_reset (e.g. "#Defaults env_reset") in /etc/sudoers -- also did not work.Adding \'Defaults env_keep += "PATH"\' to /etc/sudoers -- also did not work.Clearly - despite the man\n  documentation - sudo is completely\n  hardcoded regarding PATH and does not\n  allow any flexibility regarding\n  retaining the users PATH. Very\n  annoying as I can\'t run non-default\n  software under root permissions using\n  sudo.This seemed to work for mewhich takes on the non-sudo PATHI think it is in fact desirable to have sudo reset the PATH: otherwise an attacker having compromised your user account could put backdoored versions of all kinds of tools on your users\' PATH, and they would be executed when using sudo.(of course having sudo reset the PATH is not a complete solution to these kinds of problems, but it helps)This is indeed what happens when you usein /etc/sudoers without using exempt_group or env_keep.This is also convenient because you can add directories that are only useful for root (such as /sbin and /usr/sbin) to the sudo path without adding them to your users\' paths. To specify the path to be used by sudo:Works now using sudo from the karmic repositories. Details from my configuration:It\'s wonderful to finally have this solved without using a hack.Just comment out "Defaults env_reset" in /etc/sudoersJust edit env_keep in /etc/sudoersIt looks something like this:Defaults env_keep = "LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASURE MENT LC_MESSAGES LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE LC_TIME LC_ALL L ANGUAGE LINGUAS XDG_SESSION_COOKIE"Just append PATH at the end, so after the change it would look like this:Defaults env_keep = "LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASURE MENT LC_MESSAGES LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE LC_TIME LC_ALL L ANGUAGE LINGUAS XDG_SESSION_COOKIE PATH"Close the terminal and then open again.Secure_path is your friend, but if you want to exempt yourself from secure_path just doAnd appendIf you want to exempt a bunch of users create a group, add all the users to it, and use that as your exempt_group. man 5 sudoers for more.the recommended solution in the comments on the OpenSUSE distro suggests to change:to:and then presumably to comment out the following line which isn\'t needed:comment out both "Default env_reset" and "Default secure_path ..." in /etc/sudores file works for meYou can also move your file in a sudoers used directory :Er, it\'s not really a test if you don\'t add something to your path:The PATH will be reset when using su or sudo by the definition of ENV_SUPATH, and ENV_PATH defined in /etc/login.defs$PATH is an environment variable and it means that value of $PATH can differ for another users. When you are doing login into your system then your profile setting decide the value of the $PATH. Now, lets take a look:-Suppose that these are the values of $PATH for different user. Now when you are executing any command with sudo then in actual meaning root user executes that command . You can confirm by executing these commands on terminal :-This is the reason. I think its clear to you.
