I am looking for a way to concatenate the strings of a field within a group by query. So for example, I have a table:and I wanted to group by company_id to get something like:There is a built-in function in mySQL to do this group_concatRecent versions of Postgres (since late 2010) have the string_agg(expression, delimiter) function that will do exactly what the question asked for, even letting you specify the delimiter string:PostgreSQL 8.4 (in 2009) introduced the aggregate function array_agg(expression) which concatenates the values into an array. Then array_to_string() can be used to give the desired result:There is no built-in aggregate function to concatenate strings. It seems like this would be needed, but it\'s not part of the default set. A web search however reveals some manual implementations the same example:Here is the CREATE AGGREGATE documentation.In order to get the ", " inserted in between them without having it at the end, you might want to make your own concatenation function and substitute it for the "textcat" above. Here is one I put together but haven\'t tested (update: tested on 8.3.12 and working fine):Note: The function above will output a comma even if the value in the row is null/empty, which outputs:If you would prefer to remove extra commas to output:just add an ELSIF check to the function:How about using Postgres built-in array functions? At least on 8.4 this works out of the box:I claim no credit for the answer because I found it after some searching:What I didn\'t know is that PostgreSQL allows you to define your own aggregate functions with CREATE AGGREGATEThis post on the PostgreSQL list shows how trivial it is to create a function to do what\'s required:As from PostgreSQL 9.0 you can use the aggregate function called string_agg. Your new SQL should look something like this: As already mentioned, creating your own aggregate function is the right thing to do. Here is my concatenation aggregate function (you can find details in French): );And then use it as:This latest announcement list snippet might be of interest if you\'ll be upgrading to 8.4:Until 8.4 comes out with a\n  super-effient native one, you can add\n  the array_accum() function in the\n  PostgreSQL documentation for rolling\n  up any column into an array, which can\n  then be used by application code, or\n  combined with array_to_string() to\n  format it as a list:http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/xaggr.htmlI\'d link to the 8.4 development docs but they don\'t seem to list this feature yet.In case anyone comes across this looking for a compatibilty shim for pre-9.0 databases, it is possible to implement everything in string_agg except the ORDER BY clause (which is a syntax extension also introduced in 9.0).So with the below definition this will work the same as in a 9.x Postgres DB:But this will be a syntax error:Tested on PostgreSQL 8.3.Following up on Kev\'s answer, using the Postgres docs:First, create an array of the elements, then use the built-in array_to_string function.Following yet again on the use of a custom aggregate function of string concatenation: you need to remember that the select statement will place rows in any order, so you will need to do a sub select in the from statement with an order by clause, and then an outer select with a group by clause to aggregate the strings, thus:I found this PostgreSQL documentation helpful: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/interactive/functions-conditional.html.In my case, I sought plain SQL to concatenate a field with brackets around it, if the field is not empty.According to version PostgreSQL 9.0 and above you can use the aggregate function called string_agg. Your new SQL should look something like this:
