I\'m attempting to deploy my code to heroku with the following command line:but get the following error:I have already uploaded my public SSH key, but it still comes up with this error.You have to upload your public key to Heroku:If you don\'t have a public key, Heroku will prompt you to add one automatically which works seamlessly. Just use: To clear all your previous keys do :To display all your existing keys do :EDIT:The above did not seem to work for me. I had messed around with the HOME environment variable and so SSH was searching for keys in the wrong directory.To ensure that SSH checks for the key in the correct directory do :Which will display the following ( Sample ) linesPermission denied (publickey).From the above you could observe that ssh looks for the keys in the /c/Wrong/Directory/.ssh directory which is not where we have the public keys that we just added to heroku ( using heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ) ( Please note that in windows OS ~ refers to the HOME path which in win 7 / 8 is C:\\Users\\UserName )To view your current home directory do : echo $HOME or echo %HOME% ( Windows )To set your HOME directory correctly ( by correctly I mean the parent directory of .ssh directory, so that ssh could look for keys in the correct directory ) refer these links :SO Answer on how to set Unix environment variable permanentlySO Question regarding ssh looking for keys in the wrong directory and a solution for the same.I had the same issue, the steps below worked for me,  abc@gmail.com & password->ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsaif asks any passphrase don\'t use blank, fill with a passphrase,but not forget it.After generating the key you need to add it, like soand it to herokuchange directory to workspace, thanuse passphrase that you set above.Actually i also remove files below, but not sure that they are imp, C:\\Users\\yourusername.heroku\\credientals and C:\\Users\\yourusername.ssh\\known_hostsThis problem was messing with me for a few days.This  might help.1) Find out what keys you have in Heroku now.2) Build a ~/.ssh/config file:Edit with this infoHere is the link that explains how to manage your ssh keys : http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys#adding_keys_to_herokuI had the same problem cause i had no public keys, so i did:That will generate a public key and then it works wellIf you are a windows user the other solutions here probably won\'t solve your problem.I use Windows 7 64-Bit + Git-1.7.7.1-preview20111027 and the solution was to copy my keys from C:\\users\\user\\.ssh to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\.ssh. That\'s where this git client looks for the keys when pushing to heroku. I hope this helps.This was the solution for me:To share my experience :Git (my own install) was looking for the key named \'id_rsa\'.So I tried to rename my keys to \'id_rsa\' and \'id_rsa.pub\' and it worked.Btw, I\'m sure there is an other way to do it but I didn\'t look deeper yet.If you\'ve already uploaded the key then try to remove the key and then re-upload \nit with a new key.this should work.I killed myself for 3 days trying every possible combination to try to get this to work -- I finally tried making a DSA key instead and it worked. Try DSA instead of RSA if it\'s not working for you. (I\'m using Ubuntu 11.10, ruby 1.8.7, heroku 2.15.1)On Windows 7,64 bit,the above solution (Onur Turhan\'s)  worked for me with slight changes as belowEnter email/passwordThis generated two files(id_rsa and id_rsa.pub) in my c:\\Users\\MyName directory (Not in .ssh directory)I guess adding the correct "id_rsa.pub" file is the most important.After generating the public key using keygen just verify that you are adding correct key by looking at the time-stamp when it was created.One single command works:It will make one if it doesn\'t exist.I had this problem when TortoiseGIT was installed on my machine. After changing the environment variable GIT_SSH from to and following this tutorial with ssh-keygen and keys:add, it works!Pushing was working for me and then stopped suddenly.If the heroku api is experiencing downtime, you will get this error when you try to push.  Check:https://status.heroku.com/before freaking out too hard.The above given answer DOES work, but found out I needed to do some extra steps before it worked.Sequence to followWhen executing second statement it would ask for input, just press Enter(return) three times and a key will be added.For all those who tried everything mentioned above on Windows 7 and still it didn\'t work, here is what I\'ve done:\n- open GitBash.exe from the Git directory C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\ (don\'t open a command prompt, this won\'t work).\n- add the following as mentioned above, but you have to delete the #now run git push heroku master and it should work.It sounds like your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file is not set up correctly.  Verify that:I had to do:Then it worked:Check your .ssh config for heroku. Go to the .ssh folder and open the config fileThe \'subl\' is for Sublime Text, but you can use whatever editor you wish. Look for the line "IdentityFile" and make sure it has the non public key listed:notThat did it for me. I\'m not sure why mine had the public version in the config file, but it did and it was throwing the error: I was still having problems after trying all of these ideas.  This was my problem: My remote heroku repository was funked.  I refreshed it as follows:Then remove the heroku one that is wrong:Then add the new oneYou can get the sitename from your Heroku settings page for your app.  Good Luck!The problem I faced was on Windows and invariably whenever I run the "heroku keys:add" it selected the github keys. So here are the steps I followed to resolve the issueThe above command asked me to generate a new keys and following was the output\n    Could not find an existing public key.\n    Would you like to generate one? [Yn] Y\n    Generating new SSH public key.\n    Uploading SSH public key C:/Documents and Settings/Admin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub... done\n    !    The \'heroku\' gem has been deprecated and replaced with the Heroku Toolbelt,    download and install from https://toolbelt.heroku.com.The above command will not give the following output\n    Found existing public key: C:/Documents and Settings/Admin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n    Uploading SSH public key C:/Documents and Settings/Admin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub... donefor me using the above steps solved the issue and was able to deploy the application on the cloud.I was experiencing the same problem; following these steps should help:I would just to like to add that the directory is not necessarily C:\\Users\\[username]\\.ssh. It is the directory in which you created your public key in.For instance my home directory in Windows was changed to C:\\[username]. Your home directory in a .ssh sub-folder is the best and most likely place you may have created your keys. You can check your home directory in Windows with the command:If you want to use "sudo", example:you should also generate ssh key for your root user.and it\'ll work.if you don\'t use root user, generate ssh key in your user directory instead.Sorry if my sentences messed up...Try repairing permissions in Disk Utility (Mac OS X). Helped meAt first make sure hidden files are visible in your Mac.\nIf not do:Next steps:N.B. I did it in Mac OSX 10.7.2 Lion. Though the procedure should be same in others too.I have this issue as well. I am using Mac OSX. The way I fixed that was to login as adminsudo supasswordSolution of dmajkic help me at last:For Windows users it may means: git client coudn\xe2\x80\x99t find your keys.\nCheck keys in c:\\Users\\UserName.ssh\\ and! environment variable HOME=c:\\Users\\UserName\\Here is what worked for me. The heroku site is not being added to your known hosts. Go to window-other- show view-git-git repositories. From there clone the repository. Once you clone it, delete the repository that was just created and then import it from the file menu. Do this since when you clone the repository, it does not add it to the explorer view. Now you should have the git repository and the explorer view.
