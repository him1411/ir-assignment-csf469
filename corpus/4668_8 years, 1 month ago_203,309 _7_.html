How do you tell a Ruby program to wait an arbitrary amount of time before moving on to the next line of code?It\'s pretty easy:The \'num_secs\' value can be an integer or float. Also, if you\'re writing this within a Rails app, or have included the ActiveSupport library elsewhere in your project, you can construct longer intervals using the following convenience syntax:Use sleep like so:That\'ll sleep for 2 seconds.Be careful to give an argument. If you just run sleep, the process will sleep forever. (This is useful when you want a thread to sleep until it\'s woken.)sleep 6 will sleep for 6 seconds. For a longer duration, you can also use sleep(6.minutes) or sleep(6.hours).
