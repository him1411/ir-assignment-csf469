I\'m stuck and cannot escape. It says:But when I type that it simply appears in the object body.Hit the Esc key; vim goes into command mode. Then you can typeWhen you press :, a : will appear at the bottom of the screen.Or you can press Esc ZZ (Esc Shift+Z Shift+Z) to write/save if the file was changed, then quit.Or if you don\'t want to save changes you can use ZQ instead.Vim has extensive help, so type Esc:helpReturn and you will have all your answers and even a neat tutorial.Before you enter a command, hit the Esc key. After you enter it, hit the Return to confirm.Esc finishes the current command and switches Vim to command-line mode.   Now if you press :, the : will appear at the bottom of the screen. This confirms that you\'re actually typing a command and not editing the file. Most commands have abbreviations, with optional part enclosed in brackets: c[ommand].Commands marked with \'*\' are Vim-only (not implemented in Vi).Safe-quit (fails if there are unsaved changes):Prompt-quit (prompts if there are unsaved changes)Write (save) changes and quit:Discard changes and quit:Press Return to confirm the command.This answer doesn\'t reference all Vim write and quit commands and arguments. Indeed, they are referenced in the Vim documentation. Vim has extensive built-in help, type Esc:helpReturn to open it.\nThis answer was inspired by the other one, originally authored by @dirvine and edited by other SO users. I\'ve included more information from Vim reference, SO comments and some other sources. Differences for Vi and Vim are reflected too.\nIf you want to quit without saving in vim and have vim return a non-zero exit code, you can use :cq.I use this all the time because I can\'t be bothered to pinky shift for !.  I often pipe things to vim which don\'t need to be saved in a file.  We also have an odd SVN wrapper at work which must be exited with a non-zero value in order to abort a checkin.This is for the worst-case scenario of exiting vim if you just want out, have no idea what you\'ve done and you don\'t care what will happen to the files you opened.Ctrl-cEnterEnterviEnterCtrl-\\Ctrl-n:qa!EnterThis should get you out most of the time.Some interesting cases where you need something like this:iCtrl-ovg (you enter insert mode, then visual mode and then operator pending mode)QappendEnteriCtrl-ogQCtrl-r=Ctrl-k (thanks to porges for this case):set insertmode (this is a case when Ctrl-\\Ctrl-n returns you to normal mode)Edit: This answer was corrected due to cases above. It used to be:EscEscEsc:qa!EnterHowever, that doesn\'t work if you have entered Ex mode. In that case you would need to do:viEnter:qa!EnterSo a complete command for "I don\'t want to know what I\'ve done and I don\'t want to save anything, I just want out now!" would beviEnterEscEscEsc:qa!EnterIn case you need to exit Vim in easy mode (while using -y option) you can enter normal Vim mode by hitting control + L and then any of the normal exiting options will work.Pictures worth a thousand unix commands and options:I draw this to my students each semester and they seem to grasp vi afterwards.vi is a finite state machine with only three states.Upon starting, vi goes into COMMAND mode, where you can type short, few character commands, blindly. You know what you are doing, this isn\'t for amateurs.When you want to actually edit text, you should go to INSERT mode with some one-character command:Now, answering the question: exiting.You can exit vi from EX mode:w and x accept file name parameter. If you started vi with a filename, you need not give it here again.At last, the most important: how can you reach EX mode?EX mode is for long commands that you can see typing at the bottom line of the screen. from COMMAND mode, you push colon, : and a colon will appear at the bottom line, where you can type the above commands. From INSERT mode, you need to push ESC, i.e. the Escape button, going to COMMAND mode, and then : to go to EX mode.If you are unsure, push ESC and that will bring you to command mode.So, the robust method is ESC-:-x-Enter which saves your file and quits.After hitting ESC (or cmd + C on my computer) you must hit : for the command prompt to appear. Then, you may enter quit.You may find that the machine will not allow you to quit because your information hasn\'t been saved. If you\'d like to quit anyway, enter ! directly after the quit (i.e. :quit!).VIM has 3 modes of operation: Input mode, Command mode & Ex mode.Input mode - everything that you type, all keystrokes are echoed on the screen.Command mode or Escape mode - everything that you type in this mode is interpreted as a command.Ex mode - this is another editor, ex. It is a line editor. It works per line or based on a range of lines. In this mode, a : appears at the bottom of the screen. This is the ex editor.In order to exit vim, you can exit while you are in either the ex mode or in the command mode. You cannot exit vim when you are in input mode. Exiting from ex modeyou need to be sure that you are in the Command mode. To do that, simply press the Escape key.Go to the ex mode by pressing the : keyUse any of the following combinations in ex mode to exit::q - quit\n:q! - quit without saving\n:wq - save & quit or write & quit\n:wq! - same as wq, but force write incase file permissions are readonly\n:x - write & quit\n:qa - quit all. useful when multiple files are opened like: vim abc.txt xyz.txtExiting from command modePress the escape key. You probably have done this already if you are in command mode.press capital ZZ (shift zz) - save & exitpress capital ZQ (shift zq) - exit without saving.I got Vim by installing a Git client on Windows. :q wouldn\'t exit Vim for me. :exit did however...
