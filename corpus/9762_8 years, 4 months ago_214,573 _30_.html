The \'id\' field of my table auto increases when I insert a row. I want to insert a row and then get that ID.I would do it just as I said it, but is there a way I can do it without worrying about the time between inserting the row and getting the id?I know I can query the database for the row that matches the information that was entered, but there is a high change there will be duplicates, with the only difference being the id.See mysqli_insert_id().Whatever you do, don\'t insert and then do a "SELECT MAX(id) FROM mytable". Like you say, it\'s a race condition and there\'s no need. mysqli_insert_id() already has this functionality.The MySQL function LAST_INSERT_ID() does just what you need: it retrieves the id that was inserted during this session. So it is safe to use, even if there are other processes (other people calling the exact same script, for example) inserting values into the same table.The PHP function mysql_insert_id() does the same as calling SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() with mysql_query().As to PHP\'s website, mysql_insert_id is now deprecated and we must use PDO. To do this with PDO, proceed as following:As @NaturalBornCamper said, mysql_insert_id is now deprecated and should not be used. The options are now to use  either PDO or mysqli. NaturalBornCamper explained PDO in his answer, so I\'ll show how to do it with MySQLi (MySQL Improved) using mysqli_insert_id.Check out the PHP documentation for more examples: http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.insert-id.phpI just want to add a small detail concerning lastInsertId();When entering more than one row at the time, it does not return the last Id, but the first Id of the collection of last inserts.Consider the following exampleWhat happens here is that I push in my_table two new rows. The id of the table is auto-increment. Here, for the same user, I add two rows with a different varNumb.The echoed value at the end will be equal to the id of the row where varNumb=1, which means not the id of the last row, but the id of the first row that was added in the last request.An example.  The code line $course_id = $query_new->insert_id; will display the ID of the last inserted row. \nHope this helps. Try like this you can get the answer:Have a look at following links:http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_mysqli_insert_id.asphttp://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-insert-id.phpAlso please have a note that this extension was deprecated in PHP 5.5 and removed in PHP 7.0I found an answer in the above link http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-insert-id.phpThe answer is:Another possible answer will be:When you define the table, with the columns and data it\'ll have. The column id can have the property AUTO_INCREMENT.By this method, you don\'t have to worry about the id, it\'ll be made automatically.For example (taken from w3schools )Hope this will be helpful for someone.Edit: This is only the part where you define how to generate an automatic ID, to obtain it after created, the previous answers before are right.
