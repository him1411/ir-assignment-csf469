I have 2-3 different column names that I want to look up in the entire DB and list out all tables which have those columns. Any easy script?To get all tables with columns columnA or ColumnB in the database YourDatabase:More simply done in one line of SQL:In version that do not have information_schema (older versions, or some ndb\'s) you can dump the table structure and search the column manually.Now search the column name in some_file.sql using your preferred text editor, or use some nifty awk scripts.And a simple sed script to find the column, just replace COLUMN_NAME with your\'s:You can pipe the dump directly in sed but that\'s trivial.For those searching for the inverse of this, i.e. looking for tables that do not contain a certain column name, here is the query...This came in really handy when we began to slowly implement use of InnoDB\'s special ai_col column and needed to figure out which of our 200 tables had yet to be upgraded.If you want "To get all tables only", Then use this query: If you want "To get all tables with Columns", Then use this query:Use this one line query, replace desired_column_name by your column name.
