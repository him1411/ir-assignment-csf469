I\'m trying to install nodeJs into my Ubuntu 14.04 in order to use GruntJs.I\'ve read about Ubuntu different way of doing it (issues?), so this is what I\'ve done in order to install it:Typing grunt after that I\'ve got the error:So, I\'ve tried:And trying again, and still getting the error, I\'ve tried:I\'ve got this message:I did try a cleanup just in case:But nope, the error is still there: when I type grunt I still get /usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directoryWhat should I do?Found the answer. Just in case it helps someone, I do post it here:Doing a symlink solves the issue: ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node\n(My thanks and +1 vote to bodokaiser).NOTE: I think this post is not an exact duplicate, because that post was somewhat a  browserify question.The issue is not with the version of node. Instead its the way NodeJS is installed by default in Ubuntu. When running a node application in ubuntu you have to run \'nodejs somethign.js\' instead of \'node something.js\'So the application name called in the terminal is nodejs and not node. This is why it there is a need of a symlink to simply forward all the commands received as node to nodejs.I think you should upgrade lastest node versionif you are able to access node on ubuntu terminal using nodejs command,then this problem can be simply solved using\n-creating a symbolic link of nodejs and node usingln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/nodeand this may solve the problemIn my case, installing nodejs-legacy solved the issue.I\'ve found this is often a misnaming error, if you install from a package manager you bin may be called nodejs so you just need to symlink it like so If you already have nodejs installed (check with which nodejs) and don\'t want to install another package, you can, as root:Just doAnd it will start working.While ln -s is the obvious easiest fix, a piece of explanation:Because of a conflict with another package, the executable from the\n  Ubuntu repositories is called nodejs instead of node. Keep this in\n  mind as you are running software.This advice comes up, when installing sudo apt-get install nodejs.So some other known tool (I don\'t know what it does. While being known to ubuntu repositories, it is not installed by default in 16.04) occupies that namespace.Would have been nice, if Ubuntu had offered an advice how to fix this \'cleanly\', if not by doing by hand what otherwise the package would do. (a collision remains a collision... if+when it would occur)When I was using gulp i got this error.~$ gulp/usr/bin/env: \xe2\x80\x98node\xe2\x80\x99: No such file or directoryThis was removed by executing following command you have to keep in mind that /usr/bin directory has all permissions.~$ ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/nodethis works for me..
