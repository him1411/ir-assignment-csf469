I am looking for a CSS selector for the following table:Is there any selector to match all TDs containing "male"?If I read the specification correctly, no.  You can match on an element, the name of an attribute in the element, and the value of a named attribute in an element.  I don\'t see anything for matching content within an element, though.Using jQuery: Looks like they were thinking about it for the CSS3 spec but it didn\'t make the cut.:contains() CSS3 selector http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#content-selectorsYou\'d have to add a data attribute to the rows called data-gender with a male or female value and use the attribute selector:HTML:CSS:There is actually a very conceptual basis for why this hasn\'t been implemented.  It is a combination of basically 3 aspects:These 3 together mean that by the time you have the text content you cannot ascend back to the containing element, and you cannot style the present text.  This is likely significant as descending only allows for a singular tracking of context and SAX style parsing. Ascending or other selectors involving other axes introduce the need for more complex traversal or similar solutions that would greatly complicate the application of CSS to the DOM.You could set content as data attribute and then use attribute selectorsYou can also use jQuery to easily set this data-content attributesFor those who are looking to do Selenium CSS text selections, this script might be of some use.The trick is to select the parent of the element that you are looking for, and then search for the child that has the text: This will return the first element if there is more than one since it\'s always one element, in my case.As CSS lacks this feature you will have to use javascript to style cells by content. For example with xpath containsThen use the result like so:https://jsfiddle.net/gaby_de_wilde/o7bka7Ls/9/I\'m afraid this is not possible, because the content is no attribute nor is it accessible via a pseudo class. The full list of CSS3 selectors can be found in the CSS3 specification.@voyager\'s answer about using data-* attribute (e.g. data-gender="female|male" is the most effective and standards compliant approach as of 2017:Pretty much most goals can be attained as there are some albeit limited selectors oriented around text. The ::first-letter is a pseudo-element that can apply limited styling to the first letter of an element. There is also a ::first-line pseudo-element besides obviously selecting the first line of an element (such as a paragraph) also implies that it is obvious that CSS could be used to extend this existing capability to style specific aspects of a textNode.Until such advocacy succeeds and is implemented the next best thing I could suggest when applicable is to explode/split words using a space deliminator, output each individual word inside of a span element and then if the word/styling goal is predictable use in combination with :nth selectors:Else if not predictable to, again, use voyager\'s answer about using data-* attribute. An example using PHP:
