How do I find the start of the week (both Sunday and Monday) knowing just the current time in C#?Something like:Use an extension method. They\'re the answer to everything, you know! ;)Which can be used as follows:A little more verbose and culture-aware:Quickest way I can come up with is:If you would like any other day of the week to be your start date all you need to do is add the DayOfWeek value to the endUsing Fluent DateTime:Let\'s combine the culture-safe answer and the extension method answer:Ugly but it at least gives the right dates back With start of week set by system:Without:This may be a bit of a hack, but you can cast the .DayOfWeek property to an int (it\'s an enum and since its not had its underlying data type changed it defaults to int) and use that to determine the previous start of the week.It appears the week specified in the DayOfWeek enum starts on Sunday, so if we subtract 1 from this value that\'ll be equal to how many days the Monday is before the current date. We also need to map the Sunday (0) to equal 7 so given 1 - 7 = -6 the Sunday will map to the previous Monday:-The code for the previous Sunday is simpler as we don\'t have to make this adjustment:-This would give you the preceding Sunday (I think):Putting it all together, with Globalization and allowing for specifying the first day of the week as part of the call we haveThis would give you midnight on the first Sunday of the week:This gives you the first Monday at midnight:The following method should return the DateTime that you want.  Pass in true for Sunday being the first day of the week, false for Monday:Thanks for the examples. I needed to always use the "CurrentCulture" first day of the week and for an array I needed to know the exact Daynumber.. so here are my first extensions:try with this in c#.With this code you can get both first date and last date of a given week.Here Sunday is the first day and Saturday is the last day but you can set both day\'s   according to your cultureTried several but did not solve the issue with a week starting on a Monday, resulting in giving me the coming Monday on a Sunday. So I modified it a bit and got it working with this code:You could use the excellent Umbrella library:However, they do seem to have stored Monday as the first day of the week (see the property nVentive.Umbrella.Extensions.Calendar.DefaultDateTimeCalendarExtensions.WeekBeginsOn), so that previous localized solution is a bit better. Unfortunate.Edit: looking closer at the question, it looks like Umbrella might actually work for that too:Although it\'s worth noting that if you ask for the previous Monday on a Monday, it\'ll give you seven days back. But this is also true if you use BeginningOfWeek, which seems like a bug :(.This will return both the beginning of the week and the end of the week dates: I have posted the complete code for calculating the begin/end of week, month, quarter and year on my blog\nZamirsBlogNo one seems to have answered this correctly yet. I\'ll paste my solution here in case anyone needs it. The following code works regardless if first day of the week is a monday or a sunday or something else.Modulo in C# works bad for -1mod7  (should be 6, c# returns -1)\nso... "oneliner" solution to this will look like this :)Same for end of week (in style of @Compile This\'s answer):
