How do I recursively grep all directories and subdirectories?The first parameter represents the regular expression to search for, while the second one represents the directory that should be searched. In this case, . means the current dir.If you know the extension or pattern of the file you would like, another method is to use --include option:You can also mention files to exclude with --exclude.If you frequently search through code, Ag (The Silver Searcher) is a much faster alternative to grep, that\'s customized for searching code. For instance, it\'s recursive by default and automatically ignores files and directories listed in .gitignore, so you don\'t have to keep passing the same cumbersome exclude options to grep or find.Also:but grep -r is a better answer.I now always use (even on Windows with GoW -- Gnu on Windows):That includes the following options:Recurse in directories only searching file matching PATTERN.Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input file.Read all files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the -d recurse option.Print the filename for each match.Process a binary file as if it did not  contain  matching data;\n  this is equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option.And I can add \'i\' (-nRHIi), if I want case-insensitive results.I can get:Or install ack, if you want a much faster way and are doing this a lot.In POSIX systems, you don\'t find -r parameter for grep and your grep -rn "stuff" . won\'t run, but if you use find command it will:find . -type f -exec grep -n "stuff" {} \\; -printAgreed by Solaris and HP-UX.To find name of files with path recursively containing the particular string use below command\nfor UNIX:for Linux:find a file on UNIX server find a file on LINUX serverag is my favorite way to do this now github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher . It\'s basically the same thing as ack but with a few more optimizations.Here\'s a short benchmark. I clear the cache before each test (cf https://askubuntu.com/questions/155768/how-do-i-clean-or-disable-the-memory-cache )If you only want to follow actual directories, and not symbolic links, If you want to follow symbolic links as well as actual directories (be careful of infinite recursion), Since you\'re trying to grep recursively, the following options may also be useful to you:So if you want to find all files containing Darth Vader in the current directory or any subdirectories and capture the filename and line number, but do not want the recursion to follow symbolic links, the command would beIf you want to find all mentions of the word cat in the directory and you\'re currently in the directory and you want to capture the filename but not the line number of any instance of the string "cats", and you want the recursion to follow symbolic links if it finds them, you could run either of the followingSource:running "grep --help"A short introduction to symbolic links, for anyone reading this answer and confused by my reference to them:\nhttps://www.nixtutor.com/freebsd/understanding-symbolic-links/just the filenames can be useful tooThis should work:If you are looking for a specific content in all files from a directory structure, you may use find since it is more clear what you are doing:Note that -l (downcase of L) shows the name of the file that contains the text. Remove it if you instead want to print the match itself. Or use -H to get the file together with the match. All together, other alternatives are:Where -n prints the line number.In my IBM AIX Server (OS version: AIX 5.2), use:this will print out path/file name and  relative line number in the file like:./inc/xxxx_x.h2865: /**   Description  : stringYouWannaFind   */anyway,it works for me : )grep -r "texthere" . (notice period at the end)(^credit: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1987928/1438029)Clarification:grep -r "texthere" / (recursively grep all directories and subdirectories)grep -r "texthere" . (recursively grep these directories and subdirectories)grep [options] PATTERN [FILE...][options]-R, -r, --recursiveRead all files under each directory, recursively.This is equivalent to the -d recurse or --directories=recurse option.http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/grep1.html$ grep --helpack (http://beyondgrep.com/)ag (http://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)Below are the command for search a String recursively on Unix and Linux environment.for UNIX command is:for Linux command is:This is the one that worked for my case on my current machine (git bash on windows 7):I always forget the -print0 and -0 for paths with spaces.I guess this is what you\'re trying to writeand this may be something else helpful if you want to find the files grep hit Note that find . -type f | xargs grep whatever sorts of solutions will run into "Argument list to long" errors when there are too many files matched by find.The best bet is grep -r but if that isn\'t available, use find . -type f -exec grep -H whatever {} \\; instead.Just for fun, a quick and dirty search of *.txt files if the @christangrant answer is too much to type :-)grep -r texthere .|grep .txtHere\'s a recursive (tested lightly with bash and sh) function that traverses all subfolders of a given folder ($1) and using grep searches for given string ($3) in given files ($2):Running it and an example output:
