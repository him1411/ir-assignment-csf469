I want to create a custom page for my WordPress blog that will execute my PHP code in it, whilst remaining a part of the overall site CSS/theme/design.The PHP code will make use of 3rd party APIs (so I need to include other PHP files)How do I accomplish this?N.B.  I do not have a specific need to interact with the Wordpress API - apart from including certain other PHP libs I need I have no other dependencies in the PHP code I want to include in a WP page. So obviously any solution that didn\'t require learning the WP API would be the best one.You don\'t need to interact with the API or use a plugin.First, duplicate post.php or page.php in your theme folder (under /wp-content/themes/themename/).Rename the new file as templatename.php (where templatename is what you want to call your new template). To add your new template to the list of available templates, enter the following at the top of the new file:You can modify this file (using PHP) to include other files or whatever you need.Then create a new page in your WordPress blog, and in the page editing screen you\'ll see a Template dropdown in the Attributes widget to the right. Select your new template and publish the page.Your new page will use the PHP code defined in templatename.phpIf you\'re like me, sometimes you want to be able to reference WordPress functions in a page which does not exist in the CMS. This way, it remains backend specific and cannot be accidentally deleted by the client.This is actually simple to do just by including the wp-blog-header.php file using a php require().Here\'s an example that uses a query string to generate Facebook OG data for any post. Take the example of a link like http://example.com/yourfilename.php?1 where 1 is the ID of a post we want to generate OG data for:Now in the contents of yourfilename.php which, for our convenience, is located in the root WP directory:There you have it: generated sharing models for any post using the post\'s actual image, excerpt and title! We could have created a special template and edited the permalink structure to do this, but since it\'s only needed for one page and because we don\'t want the client to delete it from within the CMS, this seemed like the cleaner option.EDIT 2017:\nPlease note that this approach is now deprecatedFor WP installations from 2016+ please see https://stackoverflow.com/a/39800534/1958998 for extra parameters to include before outputting your page data to the browser.If you wanted to create your own .php file and interact with Wordpress without 404 Headers and keeping your current permalink structure there is NO Need for a Template file for that 1 page, I found that this approach works best, in your .php file:Than you can simply perform any wordpress functions after this.  Also, this assumes that your .php file is within the root of your wordpress site where your wp-config.php file is located.This, to me, is a PRICELESS discovery as I was using require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . \'/wp-blog-header.php\'); for the longest time as Wordpress even tells you that this is the approach that you should use to integrate Wordpress Functions, cept, it causes 404 headers, which is weird that they would want you to use this approach.  https://codex.wordpress.org/Integrating_WordPress_with_Your_WebsiteI know many people have answered this question and it already has an accepted answer, but here is a nice approach for a .php file within the root of your wordpress site (or technically anywhere you want in your site), that you can browse to and load without 404 Headers!Creating the template page  is the correct answer, for this just add this into the page you created inside the theme folderFor running this code , you need to select mytemplate as template of the page  from the back end please see this link for to get the correct details  https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/page-templates/. You will want to take a look in to WordPress\' plugin API. This explains how to "hook" and "filter" in to different parts of the WordPress mechanics, so you can execute custom PHP code pretty much any where at any given time. This hooking, filtering, and custom code authoring can all take place in your functions.php file in any of your themes. Happy coding :)The widely accepted answer by Adam Hopkinson is not a fully automated method of creating a page! it requires a user to manually create a page in the back-end of WordPress (in the wp-admin dash). The problem with that is, a good plugin should have a fully automated setup, it should not require clients to manually create pages.Also, some of the other widely accepted answers here involve creating a static page outside of WordPress, which then include only some of the WordPress functionality to achieve the themed header and footer. While that method may work in some cases, this can make integrating these pages with WordPress very difficult without having all its functionality included. I think the best, fully automated, approach would be to create a page using wp_insert_post and have it reside in the database. An example and a great discussion about that, and how to prevent accidental deletion of the page by a user, can be found here: wordpress-automatically-creating-pageFrankly, I\'m surprised this approach hasn\'t already been mentioned as an answer to this popular question (it has been posted for 7 years).If you don\'t want to deal with WP API, then Adam\'s answer is really the best one.If you were willing to deal with the API I would suggest hooking into the "template-redirect" hook, which would allow you to point a particular URL or page to an arbitrary PHP file while still having access to the WP.Apart from creating a custom template file and assigning that template to a page ( like in the example in accepted answer ), there is also a way with template naming convention that Wordpress uses for loading templates ( template hierarchy ). Create a new page and use the slug of that page for template filename ( create template file named page-{slug}.php ). WordPress will automatically load the template that fits to this rule.Try this:You can name your file newpage.php - put it in your theme directory in wp-content.  You can make it a page template (see http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages...) or you can include it in one of the php files in your theme, such as header.php or single.php.  Even better, create a child theme and put it in there, so you leave your theme code alone and it\'s easier to update.http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Creating_Your_Own_Page_TemplatesYou can also directly use the php page, like to create the php page and run with full path. like, http://localhost/path/filename.php
