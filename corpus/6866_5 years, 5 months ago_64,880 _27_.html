I\'m designing an HTTP-based API for an intranet app. I realize it\'s a pretty small concern in the grand scheme of things, but: should I use hyphens, underscores, or camelCase to delimit words in the URIs?Here are my initial thoughts:camelCaseHyphenUnderscoreI\'m leaning towards underscores for everything. The fact that most of the big players are using them is compelling (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/608458/360570).You should use hyphens in a crawlable web application URL. Why? Because the hyphen separates words (so that a search engine can index the individual words), and is not a word character. Underscore is a word character, meaning it should be considered part of a word.Double-click this in Chrome: camelCase\nDouble-click this in Chrome: under_score\nDouble-click this in Chrome: hyphen-ated  See how Chrome (I hear Google makes a search engine too) only thinks one of those is two words?camelCase and underscore also require the user to use the shift key, whereas hyphenated does not. So if you should use hyphens in a crawlable web application, why would you bother doing something different in an intranet application? One less thing to remember. The standard best practice for REST APIs is to have a hyphen, not camelcase or underscores.This comes from Mark Masse\'s "REST API Design Rulebook" from Oreilly.In addition, note that Stack Overflow itself uses hyphens in the URL: .../hyphen-underscore-or-camelcase-as-word-delimiter-in-urisAs does WordPress: http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/03/18/how-much-math-do-i-need-to-know-to-program-not-that-much-actuallyWhilst I recommend hyphens, I shall also postulate an answer that isn\'t on your list:Nothing At AllIn general, it\'s not going to have enough of an impact to worry about, particularly since it\'s an intranet app and not a general-use Internet app. In particular, since it\'s intranet, SEO isn\'t a concern, since your intranet shouldn\'t be accessible to search engines. (and if it is, it isn\'t an intranet app).And any framework worth it\'s salt either already has a default way to do this, or is fairly easy to change how it deals with multi-word URL components, so I wouldn\'t worry about it too much.That said, here\'s how I see the various options:Hyphen Underscore CamelCase here\'s the best of both worlds. I also "like" underscores, besides all your positive points about them, there is also a certain old-school style to them.So what I do is use underscores and simply add a small rewrite rule to your Apache\'s .htaccess file to re-write all underscores to hyphens.https://yoast.com/apache-rewrite-dash-underscore/
