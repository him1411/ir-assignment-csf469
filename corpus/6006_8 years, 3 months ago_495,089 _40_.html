Anyone know how to disable a link in jquery WITHOUT using return false;?Specifically, what I\'m trying to do is disable the link of an item, performing a click on it using jquery which triggers some stuff, then re-enabling that link so that if it\'s clicked again it works as default.Thanks.\nDaveUPDATE\nHere\'s the code. What it needs to do after the .expanded class has been applied is to re-enable the disabled link.That will prevent the default behaviour of a hyperlink, which is to visit the specified href.From the jQuery tutorial:For click and most other events, you\n  can prevent the default behaviour -\n  here, following the link to jquery.com\n  - by calling event.preventDefault() in the event handlerIf you want to preventDefault() only if a certain condition is fulfilled (something is hidden for instance), you could test the visibility of your ul with the class expanded. If it is visible (i.e. not hidden) the link should fire as normal, as the if statement will not be entered, and thus the default behaviour will not be prevented:Try this:EDIT-From your updated code:For others who came here via google like me - here\'s another approach:Remember: not only this is a css class class="buttonstyle"but also these twoclass="buttonstyle disabled"so you can easily add and remove further classes with jQuery. No need to touch href...I love jQuery! ;-)Here is an alternate css/jQuery solution that I prefer for its terseness and minimized scripting:css:jQuery:You can remove click for link by following;You can re-enable link by followings,You can not use \'disabled\'  property for links.If you go the href route, you can save it To disable:Then re-enable using:In one case I had to do it this way because the click events were already bound somewhere else and I had no control over it. I always use this in jQuery for disabling linksMy fav in "checkout to edit an item and prevent -wild wild west clicks to anywhere- while in a checkout" functionsSo if i want that all external links in a second action toolbar should be disabled while in the "edit-mode" as described above, i\'ll add in the edit functionLink example after fire:And now you CAN use disabled property for linksCheers!You should find you answer here.Thanks @Will and @Matt for this elegant solution.Just trigger stuff, set some flag, return false. If flag is set - do nothing.you can just hide and show the link as you likeI know this isn\'t with jQuery but you can disable a link with some simple css:the HTML would look like
