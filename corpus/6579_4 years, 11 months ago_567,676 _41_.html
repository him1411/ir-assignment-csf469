On an amazon linux instance, I have two scripts called start_my_app and stop_my_app which start and stop forever (which in turn run my node.js app). I use these scripts to manually start and stop my node app. So far so good.My problem: I also want to set it up such that start_my_app is run whenever the system boots up. I know that I need to add a file inside init.d and I know how to symlink it to the proper directory within rc.d, but can\'t figure out what actually needs to go inside the file that I place in init.d. I\'m thinking it should be just one line, like, start_my_app, but that hasn\'t been working for me.In the file you put in /etc/init.d/ you have to set it executable with:Thanks to @meetamit, if this does not run you have to create a symlink to /etc/rc.d/Please note that on latest Debian, this will not work as your script have to be LSB compliant (provide, at least, the following actions: start, stop, restart, force-reload, and status):\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScriptsAs a note, you should put the absolute path of your script instead of a relative one, it may solves unexpected issues:And don\'t forget to add on top of that file: Set a crontab for this after every startup it will run the test script.A simple approach is to add a line in /etc/rc.local :or if you want to run the command as root :(the trailing ampersand backgrounds the process and allows the rc.local to continue executing)If you want a full init script, debian distro have a template file, so :and adapt it a bit.This is the way I do it on red-hat systemsPut your script in /etc/init.d, owned by root and executable. At the top of the script, you can give a directive for chkconfig. Example, the following script is used to start a java application as user oracle. The name of the script is /etc/init.d/apexthis says that the script must run at levels 3, 4 and 5 and the priority for start/stop is 99 and 10.then, as user root you can use chkconfig to enable or disable the script at startup,and you can use service start/stop apexAnother option is to have an @reboot command in your crontab.Not every version of cron supports this, but if your instance is based on the Amazon Linux AMI then it will work.Just have a line added to your crontab..Make sure the file is executable:To edit crontab file:Line you have to add:That simple!You can do it :then use this command Please see this page on Cyberciti.For Debian 9 see https://askubuntu.com/questions/228304/how-do-i-run-a-script-at-start-up. It is helped me. Short version for Debian 9:\nadd commands (as root) to /etc/rc.localProbably, /path_to_file/filename.sh should be executable (I think so).The absolute easiest method if all you want to run is a simple script, (or anything) is if you have a gui to use system > preferences  then startup apps.just browse to the script you want and there you go.  (make script executable)This simple solution worked for me on an Amazon Linux instance running CentOS. \nEdit your /etc/rc.d/rc.local file and put the command there. It is mentioned in this file that it will be executed after all other init scripts. So be careful in that regards. This is how the file looks for me currently.. Last line is the name of my script.for some people this will works\nYou could simply add the following command into System > Preferences > Startup Applications:if you want to put startup also you can use first of all move your script /etc/init.d then\nchmod 777 /etc/init.d/your script nameafter apply following commandupdate-rc.d your script defaults\nremove\nupdate-rc.d -f your script removeat the startup you can see your app will run.
