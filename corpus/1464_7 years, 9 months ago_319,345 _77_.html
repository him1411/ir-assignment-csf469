I\'m playing with git in isolation on my own machine, and I find it difficult to maintain a mental model of all my branches and commits. I know I can do a git log to see the commit history from where I am, but is there a way to see the entire branch topography, something like these ascii maps that seem to be used everywhere for explaining branches?It just feels like someone coming along and trying to pick up my repository would have difficulty working out exactly what was going on. I guess I\'m influenced by AccuRev\'s stream browser...git log --graph or gitk.  (Both also accept --all, which will show all the branches instead of just the current one.)Edit:\nFor branch names and a compact view, try: git log --graph --decorate --onelineI usually useWith colors (if your shell is Bash):This will print text-based representation like this:(You could just use git log --format=oneline, but it will tie commit messages to numbers, which looks less pretty IMHO).To make a shortcut for this command, you may want to edit your ~/.gitconfig file:However, as Sodel the Vociferous notes in the comments, such long formatting command is hard to memorize.  Usually, it\'s not a problem as you may put it into the ~/.gitconfig file.  However, if you sometimes have to log in to a remote machine where you can\'t modify the config file, you could use a more simple but faster to type version:2\xc2\xa2: I have 3 aliases (and 4 alias-aliases for quick usage) that I normally throw in my ~/.gitconfig file:git lg/git lg1 looks like this:git lg2 looks like this:and git lg3 looks like this:Note: Answer copied from and improved upon the answer at stackoverflow.com/questions/1057564/pretty-git-branch-graphs since it\'s far more appropriate here than it was there.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Left the copy on the other question for historical reasons\xe2\x80\x94 it\'s closed now, and the answer\'s referenced by a bunch of other answers.To any of these recipes (based on git log or gitk), you can add --simplify-by-decoration to collapse the uninteresting linear parts of the history.  This makes much more of the topology visible at once.  I can now understand large histories that would be incomprehensible without this option!I felt the need to post this because it doesn\'t seem to be as well-known as it should be.  It doesn\'t appear in most of the Stack Overflow questions about visualizing history, and it took me quite a bit of searching to find--even after I knew I wanted it!  I finally found it in this Debian bug report.  The first mention on Stack Overflow seems to be this answer by Antoine Pelisse.Gitk sometime painful for me to read.Motivate me to write GitVersionTree."99.999% of my time is looking history by git lg and the 0.001% is by git log"Just wanna share 2 log aliases that might be useful. (configure from .gitconfig)I like, with git log, to do:(also with --all, for viewing remote branches as well)Works with recent Git releases: introduced since 1.6.3 (Thu, 7 May 2009)"--pretty=<style>" option to the log family of commands can now be  spelled as "--format=<style>".\n  In addition, --format=%formatstring is a short-hand for --pretty=tformat:%formatstring."--oneline" is a synonym for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit".You can also limit the span of the log display (number of commits):(show only the last 5 commits)What I do not like about the current selected solution is:It displayed way too much info (when I want only to look at a quick summary):gitk is great, but forces me to leave the shell session for another window, whereas displaying the last n commits quickly is often enough.Take a look at Gitkraken - a cross-platform GUI that shows topology in a lucid way.Here\'s a quick video tutorial on some advanced features.Gitg is a great tool for Linux, similar to Gitx for OS X. Just run \'gitg\' on the command line from somewhere inside your repository\'s tree structure (same with gitx).I found "git-big-picture" quite useful: https://github.com/esc/git-big-pictureIt creates pretty 2D graphs using dot/graphviz instead of the rather linear, "one-dimensional" views gitk and friends produce. With the -i option it shows the branch points and merge commits but leaves out everything in-between. A nice web based tool is ungit. It runs on any platform that node.js & git supports. There is a video of how it works for those that find that sort of things easier than reading...Have a look at BranchMaster.I wrote it to visualize complex branch structure, by collapsing all commits between them to a single line. The numbers indicates the number of commits.Giggle draws nice graphsI use the following aliases. It has more info in the color scheme than aliases that I saw above.  It also seems to be quite common, so you might have a chance of it existing in other\'s environment or being able to mention it in conversation without having to explain it.With screenshots and  a full description here:\nhttp://blog.kfish.org/2010/04/git-lola.htmlTortoise Git has a tool called "Revision Graph". If you\'re on Windows it\'s as easy as right click on your repo --> Tortoise Git --> Revision Graph.I found this blog post which shows a concise way:I usually create an alias for the above command:and simple just use gg.My personal favorite alias, via .gitconfig, is:Old post, but check out SmartGit. It very much reminds of the Tortoise HG branch visualization and it\'s free for non-commercial use.Gitx is also a fantastic visualization tool if you happen to be on OS X.Another git log command. This one with fixed-width columns:I have this git log alias in ~/.gitconfig to view the graph history:With the alias in place, git l will show something like this:In Git 2.12+ you can even customize the line colors of the graph using the log.graphColors configuration option. As for the logs\' format, it\'s similar to --oneline, with the addition of the author name (respecting .mailmap) and the relative author date. Note that the %C(auto) syntax, which tells Git to use the default colors for commit hash, etc. is supported in Git >= 1.8.3.On Windows there is a very useful tool you can use :  git extensions. It\'s a gui tool and makes git operations very easy.Also it\'s open sourced. http://gitextensions.github.ioNobody mentioned tig? It doesn\'t fold branches like "BranchMaster", but...It is fast, runs in the terminal.Because it is so quick (+ keyboard control) you get a great UX,\nit is almost like my "ls" for directories containing git repositories.https://jonas.github.io/tig/It has the usual shortcuts, / to search, etc.(ps. it is the terminal in the background of this screenshot, it looks better nowadays, but my computer refuses to take a screenshot, sorry)(pps. I use gitkraken as well and has really clear visualisations, but it\'s much heavier than tig)I\'ve tried --simplify-by-decoration but all my merges are not shown.  So I instead just prune off lines with no "\\" and "/" symbols at the headers, while always keeping lines with "(" indicating branches immediately after that.  When showing branch history I\'m in general uninterested in commit comments, so I remove them too.  I end up with the following shell alias.
