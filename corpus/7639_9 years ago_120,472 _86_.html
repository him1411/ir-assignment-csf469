I have a simple 2-column layout with a footer that clears both the right and left div in my markup.  My problem is that I can\'t get the footer to stay at the bottom of the page in all browsers.  It works if the content pushes the footer down, but that\'s not always the case. It\'s not working properly in Firefox. I\'m seeing a strip of background color below the footer when there\'s not enough content on the page to push the footer all the way down to the bottom of the browser window. Unfortunately, this is the default state of the page. Sticky footer:Have a <div> with class="wrapper" for your content.Right before the closing </div> of the wrapper place the\n<div class="push"></div>.Right after the closing </div> of the wrapper place the \n<div class="footer"></div>.Probably the most obvious and non-hacky way to go about a sticky footer would be to make use of the new css viewport units.Take for example the following simple markup:If the header is say 80px high and the footer is 40px high, then we can make our sticky footer with one single rule on the content div:Which means: let the height of the content div be at least 100% of the viewport height minus the combined heights of the header and footer.That\'s it.... and here\'s how the same code works with lots of content in the content div:NB:1) The height of the header and footer must be known2) Old versions of IE (IE8-) and Android (4.4-) don\'t support viewport units. (caniuse)3) Once upon a time webkit had a problem with viewport units within a calc rule. This has indeed been fixed (see here) so there\'s no problem there. However if you\'re looking to avoid using calc for some reason you can get around that using negative margins and padding with box-sizing -Like so:You could use position: absolute following to put the footer at the bottom of the page, but then make sure your 2 columns have the appropriate margin-bottom so that they never get occluded by the footer.Solution inspired by Philip Walton\'s sticky footer. This solution is valid only for:It is based on the flex display, leveraging the flex-grow property, which allows an element to grow in either height or width (when the flow-direction is set to either column or row respectively), to occupy the extra space in the container.We are going to leverage also the vh unit, where 1vh is defined as: 1/100th of the height of the viewportTherefore a height of 100vh it\'s a concise way to tell an element to span the full viewport\'s height.This is how you would structure your web page:In order to have the footer stick to the bottom of the page, you want the space between the body and the footer to grow as much as it takes to push the footer at the bottom of the page.Therefore our layout becomes:The above described method is implemented as followsYou can have a look at the JSFiddle.Be aware that Safari has a flawed implementation of the flex-shrink property, which allows items to shrink more than the minimum height that would be required to display the content.\nTo fix this issue you will have to set the flex-shrink property explicitly to 0 to the .content and the footer in the above example:Set the CSS for the #footer to:You will then need to add a padding or margin to the bottom of your #sidebar and #content to match the height of #footer or when they overlap, the #footer will cover them.Also, if I remember correctly, IE6 has a problem with the bottom: 0 CSS. You might have to use a JS solution for IE6 (if you care about IE6 that is).Here is a solution with jQuery that works like a charm. It checks if the height of the window is greater than the height of the body. If it is, then it changes the margin-top of the footer to compensate. Tested it in Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera.If your footer already has a margin-top (of 50 pixels, for example) you will need to change the last part for:Use absolute positioning and z-index to create a sticky footer div at any resolution using the following steps: Here is an example:Try putting a container div (with overflow:auto) around the content and sidebar.If that doesn\'t work, do you have any screenshots or example links where the footer isn\'t displayed properly?One solution would be to set the min-height for the boxes. Unfortunately it seems that it\'s not well supported by IE (surprise).I\'ll add to @Jimmy: You also need to have to declare absolute (or relative) positioning to the element that contains the footer.\nIn your case, it\'s the body element.  Edit: I tested it on your page with firebug and it seemed to work very well...None of these pure css solutions work properly with dynamically resizing content (at least on firefox and Safari) e.g., if you have a background set on the container div, the page and then resize (adding a few rows) table inside the div, the table can stick out of the bottom of the styled area, i.e., you can have half the table in white on black theme and half the table complete white because both the font-color and background color is white. It\'s basically unfixable with themeroller pages.Nested div multi-column layout is an ugly hack and the 100% min-height body/container div for sticking footer is an uglier hack.The only none-script solution that works on all the browsers I\'ve tried: a much simpler/shorter table with thead (for header)/tfoot (for footer)/tbody (td\'s for any number of columns) and 100% height. But this have perceived semantic and SEO disadvantages (tfoot must appear before tbody. ARIA roles may help decent search engines though).CSS :HTML:This should do the trick if you are looking for a responsive footer aligned at the bottom of the page,which always keeps a top-margin of 80% of the viewport height.For this question many of the answers I have seen are clunky, hard to implement and inefficient so I thought I\'d take a shot at it and come up with my own solution which is just a tiny bit of css and htmlthis works by setting the height of the footer and then using css calc to work out the minimum height the page can be with the footer still at the bottom, hope this helps some people :)Here is a site with a floating sticky footer that is technically impressive (whether you like the EXACT aesthetics or not):http://alltop.com/(click through to a category like Science to see the floating footer in IE)You may look into their CSS and see if you can track all their tricks. I find I have my best CSS luck by starting with something that works and trimming away the parts I don\'t need.Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal.\n  â€” Steve jobs\n  (quoting Pablo Picasso)Multiple people have put the answer to this simple problem up here, but I have one thing to add, considering how frustrated I was until I figured out what I was doing wrong.As mentioned the most straightforward way to do this is like so..However the property not mentioned in posts, presumably because it is usually default, is the position: static on the body tag. Position relative will not work!My wordpress theme had overridden the default body display and it confused me for an obnoxiously long time.jQuery CROSSBRAWSER CUSTOM PLUGIN - $.footerBootom()Or use jQuery like I do, and set your footer height to auto or to fix ... what ever you like, it will work anyway. this plugin usees jQuery selectors so to make it work you will have to include jQuery library to your file. Anyway...Here is how You run the plugin. Import jQuery, copy the code of this custom jQuery plugin and import it after importing jQuery!. It is very simple and basic but important. When you do it all you have to do is run this code:there is no need to place it inside the document ready event. It will run well as it is. It will recalculate position of your footer when page is loaded and when window get resized.Here is the code of the plugin which u do not have to understand. Just know how to implement it. It does the job for you. However if you like to know how it works just look through the code. I left there coments for you.An old thread I know, but if you are looking for a responsive solution, this jQuery addition will help: Full guide can be found here: https://pixeldesigns.co.uk/blog/responsive-jquery-sticky-footer/I have created a very simple library https://github.com/ravinderpayal/FooterJS It is very simple in use. After including library, just call this line of code. Footers can be dynamically changed by recalling above function with different parameter/id. Note:- You haven\'t to alter or add any CSS. Library is dynamic which implies that even if screen is resized after loading page it will reset the position of footer. I have created this library, because CSS solves the problem for a while but when size of display changes significantly,from desktop to tablet or vice versa, they either overlap the content or they no longer remains sticky.Another solution is CSS Media Queries, but you have to manually write different CSS styles for different size of screens while this library does its work automatically and is supported by all basic JavaScript supporting browser.Edit\nCSS solution:Now, if the height of display is more than your content length, we will make footer fixed to bottom and if not, it will automatically appear in very end of display as you need to scroll to view this.And, it seems a better solution than JavaScript/library one.I wasn\'t having any luck with the solutions suggested on this page before but then finally, this little trick worked. I\'ll include it as another possible solution.Flex layout is preferred for natural header and footer heights. This flex solution is tested in modern browsers and actually works :) in IE11.See JS Fiddle.HTMLCSSI have myself struggled with this sometimes and I always found that the solution with all those div\'s within each other was a messy solution. \nI just messed around with it a bit, and I personally found out that this works and it certainly is one of the simplest ways:What I like about this is that no extra HTML needs to be applied. You can simply add this CSS and then write your HTML as whenever
