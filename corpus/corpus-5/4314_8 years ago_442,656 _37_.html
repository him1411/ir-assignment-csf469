I want to checkout a specific revision of a folder in Subversion using the command line.I don\'t see an option for specifying the revision number in TortoiseProc.exe,How do I get the revision I want? Is TortoiseProc.exe the right tool for what I want to do?If you already have it checked out locally then you can cd to where it is checked out, then use this syntax: ref: Checkout a specific revision from subversion from command lineEither orAny reason for using TortoiseProc instead of just the normal svn command line?I\'d use:(to get revision 1234)You should never use TortoiseProc.exe as a command-line Subversion client! TortoiseProc should be utilized for TortoiseSVN GUI automation only. See the note in TortoiseSVN\'s Manual:Remember that TortoiseSVN is a GUI client, and this automation guide\n  shows you how to make the TortoiseSVN dialogs appear to collect user\n  input. If you want to write a script which requires no input, you\n  should use the official Subversion command line client instead.Use Subversion command-line svn.exe client. With the command-line client, you can runCheckout a working copy in REV revision:svn checkout --revision REV https://svn.example.com/svn/MyRepo/trunk/ svn checkout https://svn.example.com/svn/MyRepo/trunk/@REVUpdate your local working copy to REV revision:svn update --revision REVExport (i.e. download) a file or a development branch in REV revision:svn export --revision REV https://svn.example.com/svn/MyRepo/trunk/svn export https://svn.example.com/MyRepo/trunk/@REVYou may notice that with svn checkout and svn export you can enter REV number as --revision REV argument and as trailing @REV after URL. The first one is called operative revision, and the second one is called peg revision. Read SVNBook for more information about peg and operative revisions concept.Use svn log command to find out which revisions are available:Which prints:Note the number r761.  Here is the command description:I used this command specifically:Which causes calcFeatures.m revision 761 to be checked out to the current directory.I believe the syntax for this is /rev:<revisionNumber>Documentation for this can be found hereYou could tryto get revision 1234.I\'m not 100% sure the /rev option is compatible with checkout, but I got the idea from some TortoiseProc documentation.It seems that you can use the repository browser. Click the revision button at top-right and change it to the revision you want. Then right-click your file in the browser and use \'Copy to working copy...\' but change the filename it will check out, to avoid a clash.You\'ll have to use svn directly:andgives you a little more help.Go to folder and use the command:
