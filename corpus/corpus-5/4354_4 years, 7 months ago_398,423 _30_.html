I want to get the version of node.js on the command line - I\'m expecting to run a command like:but that doesn\'t work. Does anybody know what the command line would be? (ie not the REPL)The command line for that is:OrNote:If node -v doesn\'t work, but nodejs -v does, then something\'s not set up quite right on your system. See this other question for ways to fix it.If you\'re referring to the shell command line, either of the following will work:Just typing node version will cause node.js to attempt loading a module named version, which doesn\'t exist unless you like working with confusing module names.Try  nodejs instead of just nodeNode:node --version or node -vnpm:npm --version or npm -vV8 engine version:find the installed node version.or And if you want more information about installed node(i.e. node version,v8 version,platform,env variables info etc.)then just do this.where The process object is a global that provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process.If you want to check in command prompt use node -v or node --version If u have node.exe then in node you can give.By default node package is nodejs, so use orYou can make a link usingthen u can use or You can check if you have Node and Npm installed by typing:$node --version && npm --versionOne cool tip if you are using the Atom editor. It will return you not only the node version but also few other things.
