I have a string that looks like this:0000000020C90037:TEMP:dataAnd I need to grab everything after the first colon, so that I have TEMP:data.I don\'t often work in Javascript, if it were PHP I would do this:You don\'t need to split. You can use indexOf and substr:But the equivalent to explode would be split.Looks like you want splitTry this:create\'s an object :Use String.split"0000000020C90037:TEMP:data".split(\':\')If you like php, take a look at php.JS - JavaScript explodeOr in normal JavaScript functionality:\n`console.log((\'0000000020C90037:TEMP:data\').split(":").slice(1).join(\':\'))outputs: TEMP:dataWith no intentions to critique John Hartsock, just in case the number of delimiters may vary for anyone using the given code, I would formally suggest to use this instead...So I know that this post is pretty old, but I figured I may as well add a function that has helped me over the years. Why not just remake the explode function using split as mentioned above? Well here it is:This function works well if you are trying to get the values between two values. For instance:If you were interested in getting the information from between the two [values] "tags", you could use the function like the following.But let\'s say you don\'t have those handy "tags" like the example above displayed. No matter.Wana see it in action?
