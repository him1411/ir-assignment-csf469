I\'m trying to convert a list to a tuple. When I google it, I find a lot of answers similar to:But if I do that I get this error message:TypeError: \'tuple\' object is not callableHow can I fix this problem?It should work fine. Don\'t use tuple, list or other special names as a variable name. It\'s probably what\'s causing your problem.Expanding on eumiro\'s comment, normally tuple(l) will convert a list l into a tuple:However, if you\'ve redefined tuple to be a tuple rather than the type tuple:then you get a TypeError since the tuple itself is not callable:You can recover the original definition for tuple by quitting and restarting your interpreter, or (thanks to @glglgl):You might have done something like this:Here\'s the problem... Since you have used a tuple variable to hold a tuple (45, 34) earlier... So, now tuple is an object of type tuple now...It is no more a type and hence, it is no more Callable.Never use any built-in types as your variable name... You do have any other name to use. Use any arbitrary name for your variable instead...to convert list to tuple,I find many answers up to date and properly answered but will add something new to stack of answers.In python there are infinite ways to do this, \nhere are some instances\nNormal way smart wayRemember tuple is immutable ,used for storing something valuable.\nFor example password,key or hashes are stored in tuples or dictionaries.\nIf knife is needed why to use sword to cut apples.\nUse it wisely,will also make your program efficient. To add another alternative to tuple(l), as of Python >= 3.5 you can do: short, a bit faster but probably suffers from readability. This essentially unpacks the list l inside a tuple literal which is created due to the presence of the single comma ,.P.s: The error you are receiving is due to masking of the name tuple i.e you assigned to the name tuple somewhere e.g tuple = (1, 2, 3).Using del tuple you should be good to go.This is what I am doing:
