How do I convert a nullable int to an int? Suppose I have 2 type of int as below:I want to assign v1\'s value to v2. v2 = v1; will cause an error. How do I convert v1 to v2?The other answers so far are all correct; I just wanted to add one more that\'s slightly cleaner:Any Nullable<T> is implicitly convertible to its T, PROVIDED that the entire expression being evaluated can never result in a null assignment to a ValueType. So, the null-coalescing operator ?? is just syntax sugar for the ternary operator:...which is in turn syntax sugar for an if/else:Also, as of .NET 4.0, Nullable<T> has a "GetValueOrDefault()" method, which is a null-safe getter that basically performs the null-coalescing shown above, so this works too:Like this,You can use the Value property for assignment.All you need is.. You can\'t do it if v1 is null, but you can check with an operator.If you know that v1 has a value, you can use the Value property:Using the GetValueOrDefault method will assign the value if there is one, otherwise the default for the type, or a default value that you specify:You can use the HasValue property to check if v1 has a value:There is also language support for the GetValueOrDefault(T) method:GetValueOrDefault()retrieves the value of the object. If it is null, it returns the default value of int , which is 0.Example:v2= v1.GetValueOrDefault();it\'s possible with v2 = Convert.ToInt32(v1);You could doA simple conversion between v1 and v2 is not possible because v1 has a larger domain of values than v2.  It\'s everything v1 can hold plus the null state.  To convert you need to explicitly state what value in int will be used to map the null state.  The simplest way to do this is the ?? operatorThis can also be done in long form Int nullable to int conversion can be done like so:It will assign value of v1 to v2 if it is not null, else it will take a default value as zero.Or below is the other way to write it.
