I\'m trying to draw a shadow under the bottom edge of a UIView in Cocoa Touch. I understand that I should use CGContextSetShadow() to draw the shadow, but the Quartz 2D programming guide is a little vague:I\'ve tried the following in a UIView subclass:..but this doesn\'t work for me and I\'m a bit stuck about (a) where to go next and (b) if there\'s anything I need to do to my UIView to make this work?In your current code, you save the GState of the current context, configure it to draw a shadow .. and the restore it to what it was before you configured it to draw a shadow. Then, finally, you invoke the superclass\'s implementation of drawRect: .Any drawing that should be affected by the shadow setting needs to happen after but beforeSo if you want the superclass\'s drawRect: to be \'wrapped\' in a shadow, then how about if you rearrange your code like this?A by far easier approach is to set some layer attributes of the view on initialization:You need to import QuartzCore.This will slow down the application. \nAdding the following line can improve performance as long as your view is visibly rectangular:Same solution, but just to remind you: You can define the shadow directly in the storyboard.Ex:You can try this .... you can play with the values.\nThe shadowRadius dictates the amount of blur. shadowOffset dictates where the shadow goes.Swift 2.0Swift 3.0Example with spreadTo create a basic shadow Basic Shadow example in Swift 2.0Simple and clean solution using Interface BuilderAdd a file named UIView.swift in your project (or just paste this in any file) :Then this will be available in Interface Builder for every view in the Utilities Panel > Attributes Inspector :You can easily set the shadow now.Notes:\n - The shadow won\'t appear in IB, only at runtime.\n - As Mazen Kasser saidTo those who failed in getting this to work [...] make sure Clip Subviews (clipsToBounds) is not enabledI use this as part of my utils. With this we can not only set shadow but also can get a rounded corner for any UIView. Also you could set what color shadow you prefer. Normally black is preferred but sometimes, when the background is non-white you might want something else. Here\'s what I use -To use this we need to call this - [utils roundedLayer:yourview.layer radius:5.0f shadow:YES];To those who failed in getting this to work (As myself!) after trying all the answers here, just make sure Clip Subviews is not enabled at the Attributes inspector...Swift 3You can use my utility function created for shadow and corner radius as below:Hope it will help you!!!All Answer all well but I want to add one more point If you encounter a problem when you have table cells, Deque a new cell there is a mismatch in shadow so in this case, you need to place your shadow code in a layoutSubviews method so that it will behave nicely in all conditions.or in ViewControllers for specific view place shadow code inside the following method so that it\'s work wellI have modified my shadow implementation for new devs for more generalized form ex:
