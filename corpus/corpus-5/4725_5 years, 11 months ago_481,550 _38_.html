I have a couple of hyperlinks on my page. A FAQ that users will read when they visit my help section.Using Anchor links, I can make the page scroll towards the anchor and guide the users there.Is there a way to make that scrolling smooth?But notice that he\'s using a custom JavaScript library. Maybe jQuery offers somethings like this baked in?And here\'s the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/9SDLw/If your target element does not have an ID, and you\'re linking to it by its name, use this:For increased performance, you should cache that $(\'html, body\') selector, so that it doesn\'t run every single time an anchor is clicked:If you want the URL to be updated, do it within the animate callback:The correct syntax is:Simplifying: DRYExplanation of href*=\\\\#:this worked perfect for meI suggest you to make this generic code : You can see a very good article here : jquery-effet-smooth-scroll-defilement-fluideOfficial:\nhttp://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/Using JQuery:Adding this:is somehow nullifying the vertical offsetin Firefox and IE, ut not in Chrome. Basically, the page scrolls smoothly to the point at which it should stop based upon the offset, but then jumps down to where the page would go without the offset.It does add the hash to the end of the url, but pressing back does not take you back to the top, it just removes the hash from the url and leaves the viewing window where it sits.Here is the full js I am using:This solution will also work for the following URLs, without breaking anchor links to different pages.etc.I haven\'t tested this in all browsers, yet.This will make it easy to allow jQuery to discern your target hash and know when and where to stop.The answer given works but disables outgoing links. Below a version with an added bonus ease out (swing) and respects outgoing links.I did this for both "/xxxxx#asdf" and "#asdf" href anchorsHere is the solution I implemented for multiple links and anchors, for a smooth scroll:http://www.adriantomic.se/development/jquery-localscroll-tutorial/\nif you have your navigation links set up in a navigation div and declared with this structure: and your corresponding anchor tag destinations as so:Then just load this into the head of the document:Thanks to @AdriantomicIf you have a simple button on the page to scroll down to a div and want the back button to work by jumping to top, just add this code:This could be extended to jump to different divs too, by reading the hash value, and scrolling like Joseph Silbers answer.Never forget that offset() function is giving your element\'s position to document. So when you need scroll your element relative to its parent you should use this;The key point is getting scrollTop of scroll-div and add it to scrollTop. If you won\'t do that position() function always gives you different position values.Tested and Verified Code   jQuery is the best!
