A new feature of Visual Studio 2013 is the ability to sign in with a Microsoft Account and have your settings be persisted across all of your instances of Visual Studio, amongst other things.When I installed Visual Studio 2013 Preview I signed in with one of several Microsoft Accounts I hold.I\'ve now installed the RTM version of Visual Studio 2013 (after uninstalling the Preview version) and that has kept my previous user sign in credentials.I would now like to change these sign in credentials to be a different Microsoft Account but every time I attempt to sign in with the new details I receive a message similar to the followingWe were unable to establish the connection because it is configured for user olduser@old.com but you attempted to connect using user newuser@new.com. To connect as a different user perform a switch user operation. To connect with the configured identity just attempt the last operation again.The problem is I can\'t find any documentation anywhere on how to perform a "switch user operation".   Maybe I\'m just not looking hard enough but hopefully someone here can help me out.There is a comment about this under this answer, but I think it\'s important to list it here. If you want to preserve your settings, export them first because they will be lost.From MSDN forums - since I had to hunt around far too much to find the solution to this:Worked for me.I was able to fix this by:\n1) Sign in as the old user.\n2) Sign out.\n3) Sign in as new user.In my case, it appears that it wanted to verify my license on the old account first, before it would let me switch to a new one.I resolved this problem by deleting the registry key underhkey_current_user\\software\\Microsoft\\VSCommon\\12.0\\clientservices\\tokenstorage\\visualstudio\\ideuserYou don\'t need to reset all your user data to switch users. Try clicking on your name in the upper right corner then click on "Account settings". There you will get an option to sign out of the IDE. Once signed out you can sign back in as another Microsoft account.None of the above worked for me - the following did:devenv /ResetSettingsThe nice thing about this option was it didn\'t wipe out all of my Visual Studio configuration (as /ResetUserData does)Derek\'s answer above didn\'t work for me. I am using VS 2013 Ultimate and after signing out of Visual Studio, when i tried to sign in as another user, it gave error.Then when connecting to the Team Project i saw the option to switch user, which is what i wanted all along.I faced this issue Many time from different scenarios one of them when I tryed Connecting to team foundation server for different Logged Userso the solution is easy Just Click Switch Userhope this help you what worked for me was to go to Team explorer in VS2013 and under \'connect\' you\'ll see a link saying \'select team projects\'. click this and a window opens asking you to select the project but in the bottom left corner of this window there is a (switch user) link, just click this and use your new id. simpleThanks.. only one that fixed mine was the command prompt. Devenv is located under VisualStudio 12.0 Directory under common7\\IDE if it helps..Start Visual Studio\nTools -> Import and Export Settings -> Export selected environment settings\nYou need to be really quick to navigate the menu before Licensing pop-up appears, (this step is optional: worst case scenario you would have to restore all the settings manually).\nOnce in "Import and Export Settings" dialogue you can relax.Exit Visual Studio.From the command prompt run:\ndevenv /resetuserdata\nfor the particular Visual Studio version.Safest way is to right-click on the shortcut -> Properties -> Shortcut -> Target -> copy.\nFinal command should look something like:Go through log-in and initial settings.Tools -> Import and Export Settings -> Import selected environment settings\nto restore your original settings.This worked when the error:We were unable to establish the connection because it is configured\n  for user email@address but you attempted to connect using user\n  email@address. To connect as a different user perform a switch user\n  operation. To connect with the configured identity just attempt the\n  last operation again....has both instances of email@address identical.For VS 2013, community edition, you have to delete the registry keys found under: hkey_current_user\\software\\Microsoft\\VSCommon\\12.0\\clientservices\\tokenstorge\\visualstudio\\ideuserExecute VSWinExpress /resetuserdata, located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0, to reset the user credentials for Visual Studio 2013 Express.I was also able to fix this by signing in putting my product key in and then signing out and then logging in under my new login.If the Command prompt don\'t work for you, try logging in with your account that is working then log out and then try again with your other account.
