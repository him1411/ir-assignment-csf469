I came across the following program, which compiles without errors or even warnings:Live example.What does the program do, and what is that smiley-expression?That\'s an empty lambda using a digraph disguise. Normal lambdas don\'t have beards.The program uses digraphs to represent the following:This is a lambda expression that does nothing. The corresponding symbols have these equivalents:Though they are generally unneeded today, digraphs are useful for when your keyboard lacks certain keys necessary to use C++\'s basic source character set, namely the graphical ones. The combination of the characters that make up a digraph are processed as a single token. This in turn makes up for any insufficiently-equipped keyboards or other such hardware or software.The program is using digraphs, which allow C++ programming with keyboards (or text encodings) that may not have the characters C++ typically uses.The code resolves to this:It\'s basically a Lambda expression (Lambda expression is one of C++11 features) using digraphs (both digraphs and trigraphs works on C++):Using only digraphs:Mixing them with Trigraphs:
