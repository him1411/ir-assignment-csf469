I want to set up user name & password authentication for my MongoDB instance, so that any remote access will ask for the user name & password.  I tried the tutorial from the MongoDB site and did following:After that, I exited and ran mongo again.  And I don\'t need password to access it. Even if I connect to the database remotely, I am not prompted for user name & password. UPDATE Here is the solution I ended up usingThe username & password will work the same way for mongodump and mongoexport.You need to start mongod with the --auth option after setting up the user.From the MongoDB Site:Run the database (mongod process) with the --auth option to enable\n  security. You must either have added a user to the admin db before\n  starting the server with --auth, or add the first user from the\n  localhost interface.MongoDB AuthenticationFirstly, stop mongodb : sudo service mongod stop, note the service name is mongod and not mongodb.Secondly, un-comment the line starts with #auth=true in mongo.conf file (default path /etc/mongo.conf). This will enable authentication for mongodb.Finally, start mongodb : sudo service mongod startThis answer is for Mongo 3.2.1 \nReferenceTerminal 1: Terminal 2:if you want to add without roles (optional): to check if authenticated or not:it should give you:else :Here is a javascript code to add users.Start mongod with --auth = true Access admin database from mongo shell and pass the javascript file.mongo admin "Filename.js""Filename.js"Now user addition is complete, we can verify accessing the database from mongo shell Wow so many complicated/confusing answers here.This is as of v3.4.1) Start MongoDB without access control.2) Connect to the instance.3) Create the user.4) Stop the MongoDB instance and start it again with access control.5) Connect and authenticate as the user.It\'s really simple. I\'ll dumb the following down https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/enable-authentication/If you want to learn more about what the roles actually do read more here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/built-in-roles/1) Start MongoDB without access control. 2) Connect to the instance.3) Create the user administrator. The following creates a user administrator in the admin authentication database. The user is a dbOwner over the some_db database and NOT over the admin database, this is important to remember.Or if you want to create an admin which is admin over any database:4) Stop the MongoDB instance and start it again with access control.5) Connect and authenticate as the user administrator towards the admin authentication database, NOT towards the some_db authentication database. The user administrator was created in the admin authentication database, the user does not exist in the some_db authentication database.You are now authenticated as a dbOwner over the some_db database. So now if you wish to read/write/do stuff directly towards the some_db database you can change to it.More on roles: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/built-in-roles/If you wish to make additional users which aren\'t user administrators and which are just normal users continue reading below.6) Create a normal user. This user will be created in the some_db authentication database down below.7) Exit the mongo shell, re-connect, authenticate as the user.https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#security.authorizationEdit the mongo settings file;Add the line:Restart the serviceRegardsFirst run mongoDB on terminal usingnow run mongo shell use following commandsRe-start the MongoDB instance with access control.Now authenticate yourself from the command line using I read it fromhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/enable-authentication/You\'ll need to switch to the database you want the user on (not the admin db) ...use mydatabaseSee this post for more help ... http://learnmongo.com/posts/quick-tip-mongodb-users/after you create new user, please don\'t forget to grant read/write/root permission to the user. you can try the cmd: db.grantRolesToUser(\'yourNewUsername\',[{ role: "root", db: "admin" }])
