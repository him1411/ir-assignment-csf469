I am trying to use the migrate function in Laravel 4 on OSX. However, I am getting the following error:As far as I understand, it\'s already enabled (see the image below).What is wrong, and how can I fix it?Do you have MAMP installed?Use which php in the terminal to see which version of PHP you are using. If it\'s not the PHP version from MAMP, you should edit or add .bash_profile in the user\'s home directory, that is : cd ~In .bash_profile, add following line:Edited: First you should use command cd /Applications/MAMP/bin/php to check which PHP version from MAMP you are using and then replace with the PHP version above.Then restart the terminal to see which PHP you are using now.And it should be working now.The web enabled extensions and command line enabled extensions can differ. Run php -m in your terminal and check to see if mcrypt is listed. If it\'s not then check where the command line is loading your php.ini file from by running php --ini from your terminal.In this php.ini file you can enable the extension.I have heard of people on OSX running in to problems due to the terminal pointing to the native PHP shipped with OSX. You should instead update your bash profile to include the actual path to your PHP. Something like this (I don\'t actually use OSX so this might not be 100%):On earlier versions of Ubuntu (prior to 14.04) when you run sudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt it doesn\'t actually install the extension into the mods-available. You\'ll need to symlink it.On all Ubuntu versions you\'ll need to enable the mod once it\'s installed. You can do that with php5enmod.To those that uses XAMPP 1.7.3 and MacThe reason for the mcrypt error is because your Mac uses its native php, you need to change it to the one xampp has.P.S.\nI\'d recommend using MAMP for Laravel 4 for Mac users, this issue will get resolved along with the php file info error without a sweat, and the php version of xampp is so outdated.For non MAMP or XAMPP users on OSX (with homebrew installed):     brew install homebrew/php/php56-mcryptCheers!Using Ubuntu, justdid the trick for me. You don\'t need to restart Apache since you need to use PHP just from the CLI.In Ubuntu (PHP-FPM,Nginx)After installing php5-mcryptyou have to make a symlink to ini files in mods-available:enable:restart php5-fpm:More detailGetting Laravel working on ApachePHP version : PHP 5.5.9Ubuntu version : 14.04i had a working laravel project on windows. when i copied it to ubuntu server , i started getting the mcrypt error. this after a lot of hours of trial and errorgetting artisan command working(if you are having mcrypt error while using artisan command line tool)i did a lot of trial and error so each time i run the php5enmod command before, i had error messages. but on fresh install there was no error messages. after this step i got artisan command working fixing the browser error (if you are having mcrypt error in browser when accessing local laravel index page)add the following line under the dynamically compiled extensions section of php inirestart the apache server , purge the laravel cache and everything working Or, use:(not sure if this will work on standard PHP installs - I installed php 5.5.7 using the package from :)For ubuntu try these steps if others are not working :thenthenthenfinallyHope that will help.

You may use MAMP or XAMPP or any other tools. After installing one of these tools you will need to edit(create) your .bash_profile(Assuming that you use bash). Or even simple and more professional you can use Laravel Homestead. Here is a link to official documentation: http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/homesteadAlso Jeffrey has a free tutorial about it:\nhttps://laracasts.com/series/laravel-5-fundamentals/episodes/2 I advice you to go with homestead because you will preinstall all of the following tools.Expanding on @JetLaggy:After trying again and again to modify .bash_profile with the MAMP directory, I changed the file permissions for the MAMP php directory and was able to get \'which php\' to show the proper directory.  Trouble was that other functions didn\'t work, such as \'php -v\'.  So I updated MAMP.  http://documentation.mamp.info/en/mamp/installation/updating-mampThis did the trick for my particular setup.  I had to adjust my PATH to reflect the updated version of PHP, but once I did, everything worked!Enter the command which php in the terminal to see which version of PHP you are using. If it\'s not the PHP version from MAMP, the $PATH variable used by Bash will need to be updated.First, you should use command "cd /Applications/MAMP/bin/php" to check which php version from MAMP and take note of the version (eg, php5.6.7).Once you know the version, you should edit the ~/.bash_profile file (that is, the .bash_profile that is in your home directory) and add an export line:Make sure that you replace php5.6.7 with the version of PHP that you have selected in MAMP.Once the file has been saved, make sure that you close close your Terminal and open it again. Once that has been done, you will be using the PHP that ships with MAMP.One way to easily find what the line should be that you need to put inside your .bash_profile is to run the following command inside your terminal:Copying and pasting those three lines into your terminal will correctly output the PHP version that has been selected inside the MAMP control panel.Make sure that your path contains /usr/local/bin/ (Homebrew) or /opt/local/bin (MacPorts) if you are using PHP that comes with either of these two package managers.You can find the exact location of PHP using MacPorts with the following command:Note that you should replace php70 with the version of PHP that you have installed.Homebrew-php (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php) is a tap that has various different versions of PHP.You can find the exact location of PHP using Homebrew with the following command:Note that you should replace php56 with the version of PHP that you have installed.If you are using Z Shell, just do the following:5.6.10 is the version of PHP you set in your MAMP.I am running PHP 7.0.x, so change "php70" to your version, if you are using a different version.\nAs stated in other answers, you can see your php version with $ php -v.For those who still come here today:Laravel does not need mcrypt extension anymore. mcrypt is obsolete, the last update to libmcrypt was in 2007. Laravel 4.2 is obsolete too and has no more support. The best (=secure) solution is to update to Laravel >5.1 (there is no LTS before Laravel 5.2).Mcrypt was removed from Laravel in June 2015: https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/9041in Ubuntu 14.04Ubuntu 16.04
