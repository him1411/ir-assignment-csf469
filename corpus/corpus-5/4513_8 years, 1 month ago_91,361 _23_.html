Scala doesn\'t have type-safe enums like Java has. Given a set of related constants, what would be the best way in Scala to represent those constants?http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/api/scala/Enumeration.htmlExample useI must say that the example copied out of the Scala documentation by skaffman above is of limited utility in practice (you might as well use case objects).In order to get something most closely resembling a Java Enum (i.e. with sensible toString and valueOf methods  -- perhaps you are persisting the enum values to a database) you need to modify it a bit. If you had used skaffman\'s code:Whereas using the following declaration:You get more sensible results:There are many ways of doing.1) Use symbols. It won\'t give you any type safety, though, aside from not accepting non-symbols where a symbol is expected. I\'m only mentioning it here for completeness. Here\'s an example of usage:2) Using class Enumeration:or, if you need to serialize or display it:This can be used like this:Unfortunately, it doesn\'t ensure that all matches are accounted for. If I forgot to put Row or Column in the match, the Scala compiler wouldn\'t have warned me. So it gives me some type safety, but not as much as can be gained.3) Case objects:Now, if I leave out a case on a match, the compiler will warn me:It\'s used pretty much the same way, and doesn\'t even need an import:You might wonder, then, why ever use an Enumeration instead of case objects. As a matter of fact, case objects do have advantages many times, such as here. The Enumeration class, though, has many Collection methods, such as elements (iterator on Scala 2.8), which returns an Iterator, map, flatMap, filter, etc.This answer is essentially a selected parts from this article in my blog.A slightly less verbose way of declaring named enumerations:Of course the problem here is that you will need to keep the ordering of the names and vals in sync which is easier to do if name and val are declared on the same line.You can use a sealed abstract class instead of the enumeration, for example:just discovered enumeratum. it\'s pretty amazing and equally amazing it\'s not more well known!After doing extensive research on all the options around "enumerations" in Scala, I posted a much more complete overview of this domain on another StackOverflow thread. It includes a solution to the "sealed trait + case object" pattern where I have solved the JVM class/object initialization ordering problem.
