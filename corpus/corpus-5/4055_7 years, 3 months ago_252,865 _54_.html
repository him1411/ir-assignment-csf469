This seems pretty simple and maybe I\'m just overlooking the proper flag, but how would I, in one command, copy a file from one directory to another and rename it in the destination directory?  Here\'s my command:It prompts me with the following every time:Does TestConnectionExternal\\bin\\Debug\\whee.config specify a file name\n  or directory name on the target (F = file, D = directory)?I want to suppress this prompt; the answer is always F.Don\'t use the xcopy, use copy instead, it doesn\'t have this issue.xcopy is generally used when performing recursive copies of multiple files/folders, or when you need the verification/prompting features it offers. For single file copies, the copy command works just fine.I use to get around it.Another option is to use a destination wildcard. Note that this only works if the source and destination filenames will be the same, so while this doesn\'t solve the OP\'s specific example, I thought it was worth sharing.For example:will create a copy of the file "whee.config.example" in the destination directory without prompting for file or directory. Update: As mentioned by @chapluck:You can change "* " to "[newFileName].*". It persists file extension but allows to rename. Or more hacky: "[newFileName].*[newExt]" to change extensionThere is some sort of undocumented feature in XCOPY. you can use:xcopy "bin\\development\\whee.config.example" "c:\\mybackup\\TestConnectionExternal\\bin\\Debug\\whee.config*"i tested it just today. :-)Just go to http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb491035.aspx Here\'s what the MAIN ISSUE is "... If Destination does not contain an existing directory and does not end with a backslash (), the following message appears: ... Does destination specify a file name \nor directory name on the target \n(F = file, D = directory)? You can suppress this message by using the /i command-line option, which causes xcopy to assume that the destination is a directory if the source is more than one file or a directory.Took me a while, but all it takes is RTFM.Bill.So, there is a simple fix for this.  It is admittedly awkward, but it works.\nxcopy will not prompt to find out if the destination is a directory or file IF the new file(filename) already exists.  If you precede your xcopy command with a simple echo to the new filename, it will overwrite the empty file.  ExampleThis is from Bills answer.Just to be really clear for others. If you are copying ONE file from one place to another AND you want the full directory structure to be created, use the following command: Yes, put a backslash at the end of the file name and it will NOT ask you if it\'s a file or directory. Because there is only ONE file in the source, it will assume it\'s a file. I suggest robocopy instead of copy or xcopy.  Used as command or in GUI on clients or servers.  Tolerant of network pauses and you can choose to ignore file attributes when copying of copy by file attributes.  Oh, and it supports multi-core machines so files are copied much faster in "parallel" with each other instead of sequentially.  robocopy can be found on MS TechNet.Back to the original question:could be done with two commands eg:By simply appending "\\.." to the path of the destination file the destination directory is created if it not already exists. In this casewhich is the parent directory of\nthe non-existing directoryAt least for WIN7 mkdir does not care if the directory really exists.Use copy instead of xcopy when copying files.e.g.\n  copy "bin\\development\\whee.config.example"\n          "TestConnectionExternal\\bin\\Debug\\whee.config"xcopy src dest /IREM This assumes dest is a folder and will create it, if it doesnt existsI had a similar issue and both robocopy and xcopy did not help, as I wanted to suppress the comments and use a different destination filename. I found working as per my requirements.Since you\'re not actually changing the filename, you can take out the filename from the destination and there will be no questions.This approach works well when the destination directory is guaranteed to exist, and when the source may equally be a file or directory.Work Around, use ReName... and Name it some Cryptic Name, then ReName it to its Proper NameC:CD "C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\My Web Sites\\AngelFire~Zoe\\"XCopy /D /I /V /Y  "C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\My Web Sites\\HostGator ~ ZoeBeans\\cop.htm"Ren "cop.htm" "christ-our-passover.htm" xcopy will allow you to copy a single file into a specifed folder it just wont allow you to define a destination name. If you require the destination name just rename it before you copy it.ren "bin\\development\\whee.config.example" whee.configxcopy /R/Y "bin\\development\\whee.config"\n          "TestConnectionExternal\\bin\\Debug\\"The right thing to do if you wanna copy just file and change it\'s name at destination is :xcopy /f /y "bin\\development\\example.exe"\n  "TestConnectionExternal\\bin\\Debug\\NewName.exe*"And it\'s Gonna work fineYou cannot specify that it\'s always a file. If you don\'t need xcopy\'s other features, why not just use regular copy?
