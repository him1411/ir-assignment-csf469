How do I have a Python script that can accept user input (assuming this is possible) and how do I make it read in arguments if run from the command line?To read user input you can try the cmd module for easily creating a mini-command line interpreter (with help texts and autocompletion) and raw_input for less fancy stuff (just reading a line of text from the user).Command line inputs are in sys.argv. Try this in your script:There are two modules for parsing command line options: optparse and getopt. If you just want to input files to your script, behold the power of fileinput.The Python library reference is your friend.raw_input is no longer available in Python 3.x.  But raw_input was renamed input, so the same functionality exists.Documentation of the changeThe best way to process command line arguments is the argparse module.Use raw_input() to get user input.  If you import the readline module your users will have line editing and history.Careful not to use the input function, unless you know what you\'re doing. Unlike raw_input, input will accept any python expression, so it\'s kinda like evalIf you are running Python <2.7, you need optparse, which as the doc explains will create an interface to the command line arguments that are called when your application is run.However, in Python \xe2\x89\xa52.7, optparse has been deprecated, and was replaced with the argparse as shown above. A quick example from the docs...The following code is a Python program that takes a list of integers\n  and produces either the sum or the max:Use \'raw_input\' for input from a console/terminal.if you just want a command line argument like a file name or something e.g. then you can use sys.argv...sys.argv is a list where 0 is the program name, so in the above example sys.argv[1] would be "file_name.txt"If you want to have full on command line options use the optparse module.PevThis simple program helps you in understanding how to feed the user input from command line and to show help on passing invalid argument.1) To find the square root of 52) Passing invalid argument other than numberAs of Python 3.2 2.7, there is now argparse for processing command line arguments.If it\'s a 3.x version then just simply use:For example, you want to input 8:x will equal 8 but it\'s going to be a string except if you define it otherwise.So you can use the convert command, like:In Python 2:In Python 3:
