I want to create a .htaccess file manually and discovered it seems impossible through the windows UI.  I get a you must type a filename. message.  There has to be a way to create files with . as a prefix in windows.Can this be done manually?If you start Notepad and then File -> Save As -> Write .htaccess and choose "All Files" as the type - then it will create the .htaccess file for you.Within Notepad select File > Save As...File name: ".whatever you want" (with the leading dot)You can do it in Explorer (in Windows 7) by adding a period at the end of the filename: .whatever you want.Windows will automatically remove the trailing dot when you validate.Windows 7, 8 & 10This is dead easy since Windows 7. In File Explorer, right click anywhere and create a new file. Type the new filename as .something. (notice the appended period) and press enter twice, job done.So instead of being prompted withYou must type a file name.You will instead be prompted withIf you change a file name extension, the file might become unusable.Go to command prompt, cd to the appropriate folder and type:After confirmation dialog the file will be created and you will be editing it directly.\nIf you just want to create an empty file, tryYou can do this in any program other than Explorer, e.g. Notepad, cmd.exe etc.You just can\'t do it in Explorer, and Raymond Chen has offered an explanation as to why not.You could also use DOS Prompt with "move": move x.extension .extensionUse something like notepad++ or even notepad and \'save as\' and enter the name .htaccess that way - always found it weird, but it lets you do it from a program!You can save it using SAVE AS dialog using ".something"Even if you don\'t have any third party editor (Notepad++ etc.) then also you can create files with dot as prefix.To create .htaccess file, first create htaccess.txt file with Context Menu > New Text Document.Then press Alt + D (Windows 7) and Ctrl + C to copy the path from the Address bar of Windows Explorer.Then go to command line and type code as below to rename your file:Now you have a blank .htaccess without opening it in any editor.Hope this helps you out.As an addition, if have sublime text installed in your development computer you can drag the file to your opened sublime window, right click the filename -> rename and enter whatever name even without any extension. This worked for me.
