Project that I am working at (node.js) implies a lot of operations with file system (copying/reading/writing etc). I\'d like to know, what methods are the fastest, and I\'d be happy for some advice.This is a good way to copy a file in one line of code using streams:Same mechanism, but this adds error handling:I was not able to get the createReadStream/createWriteStream method working for some reason, but using fs-extra npm module it worked right away. I am not sure of the performance difference though.fs-extranpm install --save fs-extraFast to write and convenient to use, with promise and error management.Well, usually it is good to avoid asynchronous file operations. Here is the short (i.e. no error handling) sync example:Mike Schilling\'s solution with error handling with a short-cut for the error event handler.If you don\'t care about it being async, and would rather not add another dependency just for a single function:Since Node.js 8.5.0 we have new fs.copyFile and fs.copyFileSync methods.Usage Example:benweet\'s solution checking visibility of the file before copy:Mike\'s solution, but with promises:Improvement of one other answer.Features:Usage:Code:all above solutions that do not check an existence of a source file are dangerous... e.g.otherwise there is a risk in a scenario in case source and target are by a mistake replaced, your data will be permanently lost without noticing any error.
