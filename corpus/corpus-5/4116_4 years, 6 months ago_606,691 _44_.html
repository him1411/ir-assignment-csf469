I have a simple demo here:http://jsfiddle.net/HdeZ3/1/I have an unordered list and for each list item I wish to have text on the left and then a right aligned button.  I have tried to use pull-right but this completely messes up the alignment.  What am I doing wrong?Insert pull-right into the class attribute and let bootstrap arrange the buttons.For Bootstrap 2.3, see: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/components.html#misc > Helper classes > .pull-right.For Bootstrap 3, see: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes > Helper classes.For Bootstrap 4 alpha, see: https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/utilities/responsive-helpers/#responsive-floatsThe pull-right command was removed and replaced with float-right or in general to float-{sm,md,lg,xl}-{left,right,none}In twitter bootstrap 3 try the class pull-right"pull-right" class may not be the right way because in uses "float: right" instead of text-align.Checking the bootstrap 3 css file i found "text-right" class on line 457. This class should be the right way to align the text to the right.Some code:Use button tag instead of input and use pull-right class.pull-right class totally messes up both of your buttons, but you can fix this by defining custom margin on the right side.Then use the following CSS for the classBootstrap 3Use the pull-right class.Bootstrap 4The pull-right class is now float-right in Bootstrap 4...http://www.codeply.com/go/nTobetXAwbIt\'s also better to not align the ul list and use block elements for the rows.Adding to the accepted answer, when working within containers and columns that have built in padding from bootstrap, I sometimes have a full stretched column with a child div that does the pulling to be the way to go.Alternately, have all your columns add up to your total number of grid columns (12 by default) along with  having the first column be offset.Sorry for replying to an older already answered question, but I thought I\'d point out a couple of reasons that your jsfiddle does not work, in case others check it out and wonder why the pull-right class as described in the accepted answer doesn\'t work there.  working fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3ejqufp6/(I also added a min-width to the buttons as I couldn\'t stand the look of a ragged right-justified look to the buttons because of varying widths :) )Using the Bootstrap pull-right helper didn\'t work for us because it uses float: right, which forces inline-block elements to become block.  And when the .btns become block, they lose the natural margin that inline-block was providing them as quasi-textual elements.So instead we used direction: rtl; on the parent element, which causes the text inside that element to layout from right to left, and that causes inline-block elements to layout from right to left, too.  You can use LESS like the following to prevent children from being laid out rtl too:and use it like:Apply pull-right class for the button.\nhttp://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes-floats -> Helper classesThis link will helpCan you try a custom CSS aside the bootstrap CSS to see if any changes. TryIf it works then you can try manipulating what you have or adding other formatting to this and achieving what you desire. Because you are using bootstrap doesn\'t mean if it doesn\'t offer you what you want then you just manage it. You are working with your codes and so you command it to do as you say. \nCheers!Pull right was depreciated as of v3.1.0 .\nJust a heads up.http://getbootstrap.com/components/#callout-dropdown-pull-righti just used layout..apply styles for li..orin CSSNow you need to add .dropdown-menu-right to the existing .dropdown-menu element. pull-right is not supported anymore.
