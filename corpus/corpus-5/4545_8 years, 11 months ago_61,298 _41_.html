When manually generating a JSON object or array, it\'s often easier to leave a trailing comma on the last item in the object or array.  For example, code to output from an array of strings might look like (in a C++ like pseudocode):giving you a string likeIs this allowed?Unfortunately the JSON specification does not allow a trailing comma. There are a few browsers that will allow it, but generally you need to worry about all browsers.In general I try turn the problem around, and add the comma before the actual value, so you end up with code that looks like this:That extra one line of code in your for loop is hardly expensive...Another alternative I\'ve used when output a structure to JSON from a dictionary of some form is to always append a comma after each entry (as you are doing above) and then add a dummy entry at the end that has not trailing comma (but that is just lazy ;->).Doesn\'t work well with an array unfortunately.No.  The JSON spec, as maintained at http://json.org, does not allow trailing commas.  From what I\'ve seen, some parsers may silently allow them when reading a JSON string, while others will throw errors.  For interoperability, you shouldn\'t include it.The code above could be restructured, either to remove the trailing comma when adding the array terminator or to add the comma before items, skipping that for the first one.Simple, cheap, easy to read, and always works regardless of the specs.The redundant assignment to $delim is a very small price to pay.\nAlso works just as well if there is no explicit loop but separate code fragments.Trailing commas are allowed in JavaScript, but don\'t work in IE. Douglas Crockford\'s versionless JSON spec didn\'t allow them, and because it was versionless this wasn\'t supposed to change. The ES5 JSON spec allowed them as an extension, but Crockford\'s RFC 4627 didn\'t, and ES5 reverted to disallowing them. Firefox followed suit. Internet Explorer is why we can\'t have nice things.PHP coders may want to check out implode(). This takes an array joins it up using a string.From the docs...As it\'s been already said, JSON spec (based on ECMAScript 3) doesn\'t allow trailing comma. ES >= 5 allows it, so you can actually use that notation in pure JS. It\'s been argued about, and some parsers did support it (http://bolinfest.com/essays/json.html, http://whereswalden.com/2010/09/08/spidermonkey-json-change-trailing-commas-no-longer-accepted/), but it\'s the spec fact (as shown on http://json.org/) that it shouldn\'t work in JSON. That thing said...... I\'m wondering why no-one pointed out that you can actually split the loop at 0th iteration and use leading comma instead of trailing one to get rid of the comparison code smell and any actual performance overhead in the loop, resulting in a code that\'s actually shorter, simpler and faster (due to no branching/conditionals in the loop) than other solutions proposed.E.g. (in a C-style pseudocode similar to OP\'s proposed code):Interestingly, both C & C++ (and I think C#, but I\'m not sure) specifically allow the trailing comma -- for exactly the reason given: It make programmaticly generating lists much easier.  Not sure why JavaScript didn\'t follow their lead. Use JSON5. Don\'t use JSON. http://json5.org/https://github.com/aseemk/json5From my past experience, I found that different browsers deal with trailing commas in JSON differently. Both Firefox and Chrome handles it just fine. But IE (All versions) seems to break. I mean really break and stop reading the rest of the script. Keeping that in mind, and also the fact that it\'s always nice to write compliant code, I suggest spending the extra effort of making sure that there\'s no trailing comma. :) I keep a current count and compare it to a total count.  If the current count is less than the total count, I display the comma.May not work if you don\'t have a total count prior to executing the JSON generation.Then again, if your using PHP 5.2.0 or better, you can just format your response using the JSON API built in.According to the Class JSONArray specification:So, as I understand it, it should be allowed to write:But it could happen that some parsers will return the 7 as item count (like IE8 as Daniel Earwicker pointed out) instead of the expected 6.Edited:I found this JSON Validator that validates a JSON string against RFC 4627 (The application/json media type for JavaScript Object Notation) and against the JavaScript language specification. Actually here an array with a trailing comma is considered valid just for JavaScript and not for the RFC 4627 specification.However, in the RFC 4627 specification is stated that:2.3.  ArraysAn array structure is represented as square brackets surrounding zero\n  or more values (or elements).  Elements are separated by commas.To me this is again an interpretation problem. If you write that Elements are separated by commas (without stating something about special cases, like the last element), it could be understood in both ways.   P.S. RFC 4627 isn\'t a standard (as explicitly stated), and is already obsolited by RFC 7159 (which is a proposed standard) RFC 7159I usually loop over the array and attach a comma after every entry in the string. After the loop I delete the last comma again.Maybe not the best way, but less expensive than checking every time if it\'s the last object in the loop I guess.
