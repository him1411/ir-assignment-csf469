I am trying to restore a SQL Server backup file for my database, but it is throwing an error as follow:The backup set holds a backup of a database other than the existing My database in SQL Server 2008 and the backup file is in 2005.What can be the problem?I too came across this issue.Solution : 1) Use WITH REPLACE while using the RESTORE command.2) Delete the older database which is conflicting and restore again using RESTORE command.Check the link for more details.First create a blank database of the same name. Then go for the restore option Under Options on the left pane don\'t forget to select That\'s itHave facing same problem and found the solution by doing this, using SSMS 2014 I had ran into similar problem today. Tried all the above solutions but didn\'t worked. So posting my solution here.Don\'t forget to uncheck Tail-long Backup before restoreHope it help others too!Its because the .mdf and .ldf Files from the original Db were locate at maybe c:\\programFile.... and this info is saved in the Backup!If you create the same DB on a different SQL Server where the installation is on c:\\program Files (x86)\\ .... you can not restore as usually. You need to relocate the path for .mdf and .ldf Files.Therefore: Create a empty DB on the new Server    right click on the empty Db > Tasks > Restore > DataBase > cick Device select your .bak Files > Select Db to restore into  Done!\nHope it helps!Also as important is to make sure that, your database name matches the data base name in the backup you are trying to restore. If it does not match, you will get the same error.Before doing anything else,  confirm if your backup is Full or Differential.  If you\'re trying to create a new database out of a differential backup, no matter what you do you will encounter the error. If you are using the script approach and have an error concerning the LDF and MDF files, you can first query the the backup file for the logical names (and other details) of files in the backup set, using the following:You will get results similar to the following:And then you can use those logical names in the queries:More info on RESTORE FILELISTONLY can be found from the SQL Server docs.I was just trying to solve this issue.I\'d tried everything from running as admin through to the suggestions found here and elsewhere; what solved it for me in the end was to check the "relocate files" option in the Files property tab.Hopefully this helps somebody else.I had to create new db on my local for testing & i had a back up from my prod. I created the db first and tried to run the BAK on top of the new db which produced this error for me. I deleted the db and restored it while sourcing the new db name in the restore screen itself. The db was automatically created on restore. I got work done through alternate way, using Generate scripts. That did work for me as Backup-Restore didn\'t help to resolve the issue due to same error.Some of you have highly over complicated this. I found this to be extremely simple. 1) Create a database with the same name as your .bak file database name !Important2) right click the database | Tasks > Restore > Database3) Under "Source for restore" select "From Device" 4) Select .bak file5) Select the check box for the database in the gridview below 6) Under "Select a Page" on the right Select "Options"7) Select the checkbox labeled "Preserve the replication settings(WITH KEEP_REPLICATION)Now Go back to the General page and click OK to restore the database...That is it.In the Options, change the "Restore As" file name to the new database mdf and ldf. It is referencing the source database .mdf and .ldf  files.Im sure this problem is related to the files and folders permissions. You can restore to a new DB, verify the file name syntax, it ll be in the log file, for the new SQL version ll be a "_log" suffixad check the overwrite the existing database flag in option tabFabioI was trying to restore a production database to a staging database on the same server. The only thing that worked in my case was restore to a new blank database. This worked great, did not try to overwrite production files (which it would if you just restore production backup file to existing staging database). Then delete old database and rename - the files will keep the new temp name but in my case that is fine. (Or otherwise delete the staging database first and then you can restore to new database with same name as staging database)
