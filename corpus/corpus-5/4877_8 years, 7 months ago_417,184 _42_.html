In the latest (RC1) release of ASP.NET MVC, how do I get Html.ActionLink to render as a button or an image instead of a link?Late response but you could just keep it simple and apply a CSS class to the htmlAttributes object.and then create a class in your stylesheetI like to use Url.Action() and Url.Content() like this:Strictly speaking, the Url.Content is only needed for pathing is not really part of the answer to your question.Thanks to @BrianLegg for pointing out that this should use the new Razor view syntax. Example has been updated accordingly.Borrowing from Patrick\'s answer, I found that I had to do this:to avoid calling the form\'s post method.Call me simplistic, but I just do:And you just take care of the hyperlink highlight.  Our users love it :)Just simply :if you don\'t want to use a link, use button. you can add image to button as well:type="button" performs your action instead of submitting form.You can\'t do this with Html.ActionLink.  You should use Url.RouteUrl and use the URL to construct the element you want.A late answer but this is how I make my ActionLink into a button. We\'re using Bootstrap in our project as it makes it convenient. Never mind the @T since its only an translator we\'re using.The above gives a link like this and it looks as the picture below:In my view:Hope this helps somebodyEven later response, but I just ran into a similar issue and ended up writing my own Image link HtmlHelper extension. You can find an implementation of it on my blog in the link above. Just added in case someone is hunting down an implementation.<button onclick="location.href=\'@Url.Action("NewCustomer", "Customers")\'">Checkout >></button>To display an icon with the linkDo what Mehrdad says - or use the url helper from an HtmlHelper extension method like Stephen Walther describes here and make your own extension method which can be used to render all of your links.Then it will be easy to render all links as buttons/anchors or whichever you prefer - and, most importantly, you can change your mind later when you find out that you actually prefer some other way of making your links.you can create your own extension method\ntake look at my implementation then use it in your view take look at my callUsing bootstrap this is the shortest and cleanest approach to create a link to a controller action that appears as a dynamic button:Or to use Html helpers:There seems to be lots of solutions on how to created a link that displays as an image, but none that make it appear to be a button.There is only good way that I have found to do this. Its a little bit hacky, but it works.What you have to do is create a button and a separate action link. Make the action link invisible using css. When you click on the button, it can fire the click event of the action link.It may be a pain in the butt to do this every time you add a link that needs to look like a button, but it does accomplish the desired result.use FORMACTIONJust found this extension to do it - simple and effective.The way I have done it is to have the actionLink and the image seperately.\nSet the actionlink image as hidden\nand then added a jQuery trigger call. This is more of a workaround.Trigger example:Url.Action() will get you the bare URL for most overloads of Html.ActionLink, but I think that the URL-from-lambda functionality is only available through Html.ActionLink so far. Hopefully they\'ll add a similar overload to Url.Action at some point.This is how I did it without scripting:Same, but with parameter and confirmation dialog:A simple way to do make your Html.ActionLink into a button (as long as you have BootStrap plugged in - which you probably have) is like this:
