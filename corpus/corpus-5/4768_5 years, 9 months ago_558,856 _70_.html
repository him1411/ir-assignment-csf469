I have spent been on the Maven site reading the 5- and 30-minute tutorials, and trialing Maven out for the first time.I want to install a Maven plugin and use it to start building Maven projects from Eclipse.Despite an honest effort, I have been unable to find a comprehensive tutorial on any Maven plugin. M2E, which seems like the de facto standard, has nothing but broken (or recursive) links on their site.I can\'t tell if I even installed the plugin correctly, or how to use it.Does anyone know of a good step-by-step guide to M2E or any other plugin? One that comes with good installation documentation, along with a solid explanation of its features and proper uses?(Edit 2016-10-12:  Many Eclipse downloads from https://eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/ have M2Eclipse included already. As of Neon both the Java and the Java EE packages do - look for "Maven support")Maven Eclipse plugin installation step by step:At pop up: fill up Name as "M2Eclipse" and Location as "http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases"\nor \nhttp://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/milestones/1.0Now click OKAfter that installation would be started.Another way to install Maven plug-in for Eclipse:After successful installation do the followings in Eclipse:Finally,IF you want to install Maven in Eclipse(Java EE) Indigo Then follow these Steps :Eclipse -> Help -> Install New Software.Type " http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo/ " & Hit Enter.Expand " Collaboration " tag.Select Maven plugin from there.Click on next .Accept the agreement & click finish.After installing the maven it will ask for restarting the Eclipse,So restart the eclipse again to see the changes.By "use install a Maven plugin and use it" I am sure you are looking for a Eclipse plugin that will perform Maven functions within the IDE.  If so, M2E is a good choice.  You will find a lot of help within the Eclipse installation once you install M2E.That said -- considering that you are starting off using Maven -- it would go a long way to have a good understanding of the basic concepts.  Using M2E could hide some of the details which could lead to incomplete or incorrect interpretation of Maven\'s behavior and therefore problems downstream.Some good Maven online references are:First install maven in your system and set Maven environment variablesSteps to Configures maven on Eclipse IDE:To check maven is configured properly:Open Eclipse and click on Windows -> PreferencesChoose Maven from left panel, and select installations.Click on Maven -> "User Settings" option form left panel, to check local repository location.Check This instead to avoid this error:Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found.\n    Software being installed: m2e - slf4j over logback logging (Optional) 1.6.1.20150625-2338 (org.eclipse.m2e.logback.feature.feature.group 1.6.1.20150625-2338)\n    Missing requirement: Maven Integration for Eclipse 1.6.0.20150526-2032 (org.eclipse.m2e.core 1.6.0.20150526-2032) requires \'bundle com.google.guava [14.0.1,16.0.0)\' but it could not be found\n    Missing requirement: Maven Integration for Eclipse 1.6.1.20150625-2338 (org.eclipse.m2e.core 1.6.1.20150625-2338) requires \'bundle org.eclipse.osgi 3.10.0\' but it could not be found\n    Cannot satisfy dependency:\n      From: Maven Integration for Eclipse 1.6.0.20150526-2032 (org.eclipse.m2e.core.ui 1.6.0.20150526-2032)\n      To: bundle org.eclipse.m2e.core [1.6.0,1.7.0)\n    Cannot satisfy dependency:\n      From: Maven Integration for Eclipse 1.6.1.20150625-2338 (org.eclipse.m2e.core.ui 1.6.1.20150625-2338)\n      To: bundle org.eclipse.m2e.core [1.6.0,1.7.0)\n    Cannot satisfy dependency:\n      From: m2e logback appender 1.6.1.20150625-2338 (org.eclipse.m2e.logback.appender 1.6.1.20150625-2338)\n      To: bundle org.eclipse.m2e.core.ui [1.6.0,1.7.0)\n    Cannot satisfy dependency:\n      From: m2e - slf4j over logback logging (Optional) 1.6.1.20150625-2338 (org.eclipse.m2e.logback.feature.feature.group 1.6.1.20150625-2338)\n      To: org.eclipse.m2e.logback.appender [1.6.1.20150625-2338]sourceTried every stuff but this one worked ..\n1.

You have to follow the following steps in the Eclipse IDEMaven integration for eclipse will be dowloaded and installed. Restart the workspace.In the .m2 folder(usually under C:\\user\\ directory) add settings.xml. Give proper proxy and profiles. Now create a new Maven project in eclipse.I was having problems because I was looking to install the Maven plugin on MuleStudio not Eclipse..[for MuleStudio 1.2 or below do steps (1) and (2) otherwise jump to step (2)]Instructions for MuleStudio (ONLY versions 1.2 and below):\n(1) Help >install new software...Instructions for MuleStudio (1.3) OR Eclipse:\n(2) Help >install new software...I have also come across the same issue and figuredout the issue here is the solution.Lot of people assumes Eclipse and maven intergration is tough but its very eassy.1) download the maven and unzip it in to your favorite directory.Ex : C:\\satyam\\DEV_TOOLS\\apache-maven-3.1.12) Set the environment variable for Maven(Hope every one knows where to go to set this)In the system variable:\n   Variable_name = M2_HOME\n   Variable_Value =C:\\satyam\\DEV_TOOLS\\apache-maven-3.1.1Next in the same System Variable you will find the variable name called Path:\n   just edit the path variable and add M2_HOME details like with the existing values.so in the second step now you are done setting the Maven stuff to your system.you need to cross check it whether your setting is correct or not, go to command prompt and type mvn--version it should disply the path of your Maven3) Open the eclipse and go to Install new software and type M2E Plugin install  and restart the Eclipsewith the above 3 steps you are done with Maven and Maven Plugin with eclipse4) Maven is used .m2 folder to download all the jars, it will find in \nEx: C:\\Users\\tempsakat.m2under this folder one settings.xml file and one repository folder will be there5) go to Windwo - preferences of your Eclipse and type Maven then select UserSettings from left menu then give the path of the settings.xml here .now you are done...I have just include Maven integration plug-in with Eclipse:Just follow the bellow steps:In eclipse, from upper menu item select- Help ->click on Install New Software..-> then click on Add button.set the MavenAPI at name text box and http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases at location text box.press OK and select the Maven project and install by clicking next.Maven Eclipse plugin installation step by step:Open Eclipse IDE\nClick Help -> Install New Software\nClick Add button at top right corner\nAt pop up: fill up Name as you want and Location as http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/milestones/1.0\nNow click OK\nAnd follow the instruction The latest version of Eclipse (Luna) and Spring Tool Suite (STS) come pre-packaged with support for Maven, GIT and Java 8.I have just include Maven integration plug-in at Eclipse:Just follow the bellow steps:In eclipse, from upper menu item select- "Help" ->click on "Install New Software.."-> then click on "Add" button.set the "MavenAPI" at name text box and "http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases" at location text box.press Ok and select the Maven project and install by clicking next next.
