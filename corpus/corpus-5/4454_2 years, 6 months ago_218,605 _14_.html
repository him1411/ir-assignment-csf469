This question already has an answer here:Tried to perform REST GET through python requests with the following code and I got error.Code snip:Error:My python version is 2.7.3. I tried to install urllib3 and requests[security] as some other thread suggests, I still got the same error.Wonder if anyone can provide some tips?The docs give a fair indicator of what\'s required., however requests allow us to skip a few steps:You only need to install the security package extras (thanks @admdrew for pointing it out)or, install them directly:Requests will then automatically inject pyopenssl into urllib3If you\'re on ubuntu, you may run into trouble installing  pyopenssl, you\'ll need these dependencies:If you are not able to upgrade your Python version to 2.7.9, and want to suppress warnings, you can downgrade your \'requests\' version to 2.5.3:About version:\nhttp://fossies.org/diffs/requests/2.5.3_vs_2.6.0/requests/packages/urllib3/util/ssl_.py-diff.html
