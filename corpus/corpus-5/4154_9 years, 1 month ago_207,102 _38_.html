Which are the best Python modules to convert PDF files into text? Try PDFMiner.  It can extract text from PDF files as HTML, SGML or "Tagged PDF" format.http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/index.htmlThe Tagged PDF format seems to be the cleanest, and stripping out the XML tags leaves just the bare text.The PDFMiner package has changed since codeape posted.  EDIT (again):PDFMiner has been updated again in version 20100213You can check the version you have installed with the following:Here\'s the updated version (with comments on what I changed/added):Edit (yet again):Here is an update for the latest version in pypi, 20100619p1.  In short I replaced LTTextItem with LTChar and passed an instance of LAParams to the CsvConverter constructor.EDIT (one more time):Updated for version 20110515 (thanks to Oeufcoque Penteano!):Since none for these solutions support the latest version of PDFMiner I wrote a simple solution that will return text of a pdf using PDFMiner. This will work for those who are getting import errors with process_pdf pyPDF works fine (assuming that you\'re working with well-formed PDFs).  If all you want is the text (with spaces), you can just do:You can also easily get access to the metadata, image data, and so forth.A comment in the extractText code notes:Locate all text drawing commands, in\n  the order they are provided in the\n  content stream, and extract the text. \n  This works well for some PDF files,\n  but poorly for others, depending on\n  the generator used.  This will be\n  refined in the future.  Do not rely on\n  the order of text coming out of this\n  function, as it will change if this\n  function is made more sophisticated.Whether or not this is a problem depends on what you\'re doing with the text (e.g. if the order doesn\'t matter, it\'s fine, or if the generator adds text to the stream in the order it will be displayed, it\'s fine).  I have pyPdf extraction code in daily use, without any problems.Pdftotext An open source program (part of Xpdf) which you could call from python (not what you asked for but might be useful). I\'ve used it with no problems. I think google use it in google desktop.You can also quite easily use pdfminer as a library. You have access to the pdf\'s content model, and can create your own text extraction. I did this to convert pdf contents to semi-colon separated text, using the code below.The function simply sorts the TextItem content objects according to their y and x coordinates, and outputs items with the same y coordinate as one text line, separating the objects on the same line with \';\' characters.Using this approach, I was able to extract text from a pdf that no other tool was able to extract content suitable for further parsing from. Other tools I tried include pdftotext, ps2ascii and the online tool pdftextonline.com.pdfminer is an invaluable tool for pdf-scraping.UPDATE:The code above is written against an old version of the API, see my comment below.slate is a project that makes it very simple to use PDFMiner from a library:I needed to convert a specific PDF to plain text within a python module. I used PDFMiner 20110515, after reading through their pdf2txt.py tool I wrote this simple snippet:Repurposing the pdf2txt.py code that comes with pdfminer; you can make a function that will take a path to the pdf; optionally, an outtype (txt|html|xml|tag) and opts like the commandline pdf2txt {\'-o\': \'/path/to/outfile.txt\' ...}.  By default, you can call:A text file will be created, a sibling on the filesystem to the original pdf.Additionally there is PDFTextStream which is a commercial Java library that can also be used from Python.I have used pdftohtml with the \'-xml\' argument, read the result with subprocess.Popen(), that will give you x coord, y coord, width, height, and font, of every \'snippet\' of text in the pdf. I think this is what \'evince\' probably uses too because the same error messages spew out. If you need to process columnar data, it gets slightly more complicated as you have to invent an algorithm that suits your pdf file. The problem is that the programs that make PDF files don\'t really necessarily lay out the text in any logical format. You can try simple sorting algorithms and it works sometimes, but there can be little \'stragglers\' and \'strays\', pieces of text that don\'t get put in the order you thought they would... so you have to get creative. It took me about 5 hours to figure out one for the pdf\'s i was working on. But it works pretty good now. Good luck. PDFminer gave me perhaps one line [page 1 of 7...] on every page of a pdf file I tried with it.The best answer I have so far is pdftoipe, or the c++ code it\'s based on Xpdf.see my question for what the output of pdftoipe looks like.Found that solution today. Works great for me. Even rendering PDF pages to PNG images.\nhttp://www.swftools.org/gfx_tutorial.html
