I am having a big problem trying to connect to mysql. When I run:I have the following error :I do have mysql.sock under the /var/mysql directory.In /etc/my.cnf I have:and in /etc/php.ini I have :I have restarted apache using sudo /opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl restartBut I still have the error.Otherwise, I don\'t know if that\'s relevant but when I do mysql_config --sockets I getIf your file my.cnf (usually in the /etc/mysql/ folder) is correctly configured withyou can check if mysql is running with the following command:try changing your permission to mysql folder. If you are working locally, you can try:that solved it for meare you sure you installed mysql as well as mysql server..For example to install mySql server I\'ll use yum or apt to install both mysql command line tool and the server:Enable the MySQL service:Start the MySQL server:afterwards set the MySQL root password:I hope it helps.A quick workaround that worked for me: try using the local ip address (127.0.0.1) instead of \'localhost\' in mysql_connect(). This "forces" php to connect through TCP/IP instead of a unix socket.I got the following error Tried several ways and finally solved it through the following waymodified to and restartedit workedMake sure you are running mysqld : /etc/init.d/mysqld startTo prevent the problem from occurring, you must perform a graceful shutdown of the server from the command line rather than powering off the server.This will stop the running services before powering down the machine.Based on Centos, an additional method for getting it back up again when you run into this problem is to move mysql.sock:Restarting the service creates a new entry called mqsql.sockAnother workaround is to edit /etc/my.cnf and include host in the section [client]And then restarting the mysql service.This workaround was tested in: Server version: 5.5.25a-log Source distributionAs can be seen by the many answers here, there are lots of problems that can result in this error message when you start the MySQL service. The thing is, MySQL will generally tell you exactly what\'s wrong, if you just look in the appropriate log file.For example, on Ubuntu, you should check /var/log/syslog. Since lots of other things might also be logging to this file, you probably want to use grep to look at mysql messages, and tail to look at only the most recent. All together, that might look like:grep mysql /var/log/syslog | tail -50Don\'t blindly make changes to your configuration because someone else said \'This worked for my system.\' Figure out what is actually wrong with your system and you\'ll get a better result much faster.I had the same problem and it has been caused by an update of mysql drivers when mysql server was running.\nI fixed it just restarting both mysql and apache2:sudo service mysql stopsudo service mysql startsudo service apache2 stopsudo service apache2 startIn my case, I was using Centos 5.5. I found that the problem was because the mysql service was stopped some how. \nSo I started mysql service with the command:So.. silly mistake. If everything worked just fine and you just started seeing this error, before you do anything else, make sure you\'re not out of disk space:If the volume where the mysql.sock is being created is at 100% use, MySql won\'t be able to create it and this will be the cause of this error.  All you need to do is delete something that\'s not needed, like old log files.This should serve you just fine. There could be a possibility that you changed some commands that affected the mysql configurations. I was getting the error because I was running MAMP and my .sock file was in a different location. I just added a symbolic link where the app thought it should be that pointed to where it actually was and it worked like a charm.try with -h (host) and -P(port):mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u root -pI got this error when I set cron job for my file. I changed the permissions of file to 777 but it still not worked for me. Finally I got the solution. May be it will be helpful for others.Try with this command:mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u root -pRemember that -h means host and -p means port.If you are using AWS (Amazon Web Services) Micro version, then it is a memory issue. When I ran from the terminal it would say So I tried the following and it would just fail.After much searching, I found out that you have to create a swap file for MySQL to have enough memory. Instructions are listed: http://www.prowebdev.us/2012/05/amazon-ec2-linux-micro-swap-space.html.Then, I was able to restart mysqld. you can always start mysql server by specifying the location of the mysql.sock file using the --socket option likeThis will work even if the location of socket file in specified in a different location in the my.cnf file. For those whose any solution did not work, try:check if my.cnf is presentand make sure you have only one bind-address as follows:bind-address = 127.0.0.1If not, that might be the problem, just exit nano and save the file.and service mysql startnote that if you don\'t have nano (its a text editor) just install it with apt-get install nano and once in just press Ctrl+X to exit, dont forget to say Y to save and use the same file)I also found that this was a permissions problem.  I compared the MySQL files to a working install (both on Debian 6 squeeze) and had to make the following ownership changes (where mydatabase is any database(s) you have).Ownership mysql:mysql:Ownership mysql:root:Ownership mysql:adm:This doesn\'t directly answer your question but a subset of it, namely using PythonAnywhere. I kept stumbling upon this question when looking for a fix so I\'m adding it here in the hope that it will help others in my situation.PythonAnywhere decided to change the database connection hostnames in order to improve efficiency and reliability, as detailed here:The official host name you should use for connecting to your account\'s\n  MySQL database instance has changed from mysql.server to\n  yourusername.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com. This bypasses a part of our infrastructure that has started showing problems in recent\n  weeks, and it should be much more efficient and reliable than the old\n  way.Hence, you will need to update your hostname to the value highlighted above.There are many solutions to this problem but for my situation, I just needed to correct the DATE on the machine/server (Ubuntu 16.04 Server).i) Check the date of your server and correct it.ii) Run sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restartThat should get it started.Addingto the list of pramaters in your connection worked for me.This was good enough for meI ran into this issue today. None of these answers provided the fix. I needed to do the following commands (found here https://stackoverflow.com/a/20141146/633107) for my mysql service to start:This was partly indicated by the following errors in /var/log/mysql/error.log:I also saw the disk full error, but only when running commands without sudo. If the permissions check fails, it reports disk full (even when your partition is not even close to full).CentOS 7, 64 bit. Fresh installation.\nIn my case, the error was because I didn\'t have the right MySQL server and MySQL client installed.\nUsing yum, I removed mariadb and mysql-community edition. I downloaded the rpm\'s for the client and server from the official MySQL website and installed the server and client.  On installing the server, I was shown a message that the password to the root account for MySQL was stored in a file which I could view with sudo cat /root/.mysql_secret.  So after installing the client and server, I checked if MySQL was working (I think I rebooted before doing so) with the command sudo service mysql status and I got the result.  MySQL running (2601)                                       [  OK  ]I logged into MySQL using the password from the .mysql_secret file:\nmysql -uroot -pdxM01Xfg3DXEPabpf. Note that dxM01Xfg3DXEPabpf is the password mentioned in the .mysql_secret file.  and then typed entered the following command at the mysql prompt to change the password of root:  mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR \'root\'@\'localhost\' = PASSWORD(\'somePassword\'); Everything worked fine from then on.I used 127.0.0.1 for -h instead localhost and everything was OK. In other case had what had - error that above.Worked for me, I\'m using Centos I had this problem too when trying to start the server, so many of the answers here that just say to start the server didn\'t work. The first thing you can do is execute the following to see if there are any config errors:I did have one error that showed up:A simple grep -HR "innodb-online-alter-log-max-size" /etc/mysql/ showed me exactly what file contained the offending line, so I removed that line from the file.Then, checking my /var/log/mysql/error.log file I had:Based on this question the accepted solution wouldn\'t work because I couldn\'t even get the server started, so I followed what some of the comments said and deleted my /var/lib/mysql/ib_logfile0 and /var/lib/mysql/ib_logfile1 files.This allowed the server to start and I was able to connect and execute queries, however checking my error log file it was quickly getting filled up with several tens of thousands of lines like this:Based on a suggestion from here, to fix this I did a mysqldump and restore of all databases (see the link for several other solutions).Everything appears to be working as expected now.For me - this was simply a case of MySQL taking a long time to load. I have over 100,000 tables in one of my databases and it did eventually start but obviously has to take a long time in this instance.I had this socket error and it basically came down to the fact that MySQL was not running. If you run a fresh install, make sure that you install 1) the system package and 2) the panel installer (mysql.prefPane). The panel installer will allow you to goto your System Preferences and open MySQL, and then get an instance running. Note that, on a fresh install, I needed to reset my computer for the changes to properly take effect. Following a reboot, I got a new instance running and was able to open up a connection to localhost with no problem. Also of note, I apparently had previous versions of MySQL installed but had removed the panel, which makes it easy to get an instance of MySQL running for mac users.A good link for this process of reinstalling: http://www.coolestguyplanettech.com/how-to-install-php-mysql-apache-on-os-x-10-6/
