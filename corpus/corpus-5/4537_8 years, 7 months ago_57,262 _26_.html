If I have 10 tabs opened, I have to close each one using ":q" separately. How can I close them all at once?Shortest/simplest/fastest way would be:To save work in all tabs and quit:I often use :tabo to close all other tabs.That can be done with the following\n command (in normal or escape mode):"tabdo" apparently executes the\ncommand for all the open tabs.Adding to what fuentesjr said:Will force quit all tabs, if you don\'t care about saving.You can use any of these Vim Ex commands to Exit Multiple Windows And Buffers::qa :qallExit Vim, unless there are some buffers which have been changed.  (Use :bmod to go to the next modified buffer). When \'autowriteall\' is set all changed buffers will be written, like :wqall. :conf qa :confirm qallExit Vim.  Bring up a prompt when some buffers have been \n            changed.  See :confirm.:qa! :qall!Exit Vim.  Any changes to buffers are lost. Also see :cquit, it does the same but exits with a non-zero value.:quita :quitall :quita! :quitall!Same as :qall. :wqa :wqall :xa :xallWrite all changed buffers and exit Vim.  If there are buffers\n            without a file name, which are readonly or which cannot be\n            written for another reason, Vim will not quit. :conf wqa :confirm wqall :conf xa :confirm xall Write all changed buffers and exit Vim.  Bring up a prompt\n            when some buffers are readonly or cannot be written for\n            another reason.  See :confirm. :wqa! :xa! :wqall! :xall!Write all changed buffers, even the ones that are readonly,\n            and exit Vim.  If there are buffers without a file name or\n            which cannot be written for another reason, Vim will not quit.To read about these in Vim, type the following Ex commandThis closes all tabs and open buffers.
