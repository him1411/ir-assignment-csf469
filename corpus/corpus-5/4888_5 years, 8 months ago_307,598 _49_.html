I have a small database in Elasticsearch and for testing purposes would like to pull all records back.  I am attempting to use a URL of the form...Can someone give me the URL you would use to accomplish this, please?I think lucene syntax is supported so:http://localhost:9200/foo/_search?pretty=true&q=*:*size defaults to 10, so you may also need &size=BIGNUMBER to get more than 10 items. (where BIGNUMBER equals a number you believe is bigger than your dataset)BUT, elasticsearch documentation suggests for large result sets, using the scan search type.EG:and then keep requesting as per the documentation link above suggests.EDIT: scan Deprecated in 2.1.0.scan does not provide any benefits over a regular scroll request sorted by _doc. link to elastic docs (spotted by @christophe-roussy)Note the size param, which increases the hits displayed from the default (10) to 1000 per shard.http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-from-size.htmlelasticsearch(ES) supports both a GET or a POST request for getting the data from the ES cluster index. When we do a GET:When we do a POST:I would suggest to use a UI plugin with elasticsearch http://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head/\nThis will help you get a better feeling of the indices you create and also test your indices.  The query below would return the NO_OF_RESULTS you would like to be returned..Now, the question here is that you want all the records to be returned. So naturally, before writing a query, you wont know the value of NO_OF_RESULTS. How do we know how many records exist in your document? Simply type the query belowThis would give you a result that looks like the one below The result total tells you how many records are available in your document. So, that\'s a nice way to know the value of NO_OF RESULTSSearch all types in all indicesSearch all types in the foo indexSearch all types in the foo1 and foo2 indicesSearch all types in any indices beginning with fSearch types user and tweet in all indicesuse server:9200/_stats also to get statistics about all your aliases.. like size and number of elements per alias, that\'s very useful and provides helpful informationSimple! You can use size and from parameter!then you change the from gradually until you get all of the data.This is the best solution I found using python clienthttps://gist.github.com/drorata/146ce50807d16fd4a6aaUsing java client https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/current/java-search-scrolling.htmlThe best way to adjust the size is using size=number in front of the URL Note: maximum value which can be defined in this size is 10000. For any value above ten thousand it expects you to use scroll function which would minimise any chances of impacts to performance.Elasticsearch will get significant slower if you just add some big number as size, one method to use to get all documents is using scan and scroll ids.So your call would be:This will return a _scroll_id, which you can now use to get the first batch of documents.https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/scan-scroll.htmlhttp://localhost:9200/foo/_search/?size=1000&pretty=1you will need to specify size query parameter as the default is 10A few of them gave the right answer of using scan and scroll, apparently, I could not a complete answer which would magically work. When someone wants to pull of records then one has to run following curl command.But we are not done here. The output of the above curl command would be something like this its important to have _scroll_id handy as the very next you shd run the following command However, I dont think its easy to run this manually. Your best bet is to write a java code to do the same. Now LOOP on the last command use SearchResponse to extract the data.You can use the _count API to get the value for the size parameter:Returns {count:X, ...}. Extract value \'X\' and then do the actual query:You can  use size=0 this will return you all the documents \nexample
