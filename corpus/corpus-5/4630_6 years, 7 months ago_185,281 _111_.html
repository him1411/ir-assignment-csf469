I would like to be able to detect if the user is using adblocking software when they visit my website. If they are using it, I want to display a message asking them to turn it off in order to support the project, like this website does.If you enter to that site and your browser has some kind of adblock software enabled, then the site instead of showing the actual ads shows a little banner telling the users that the ad revenue is used for hosting the project and they should consider turning Adblock off.I want to do that on my website, I\'m using adsense ads on it, How can I do that?My solution is not specific to a certain ad network and is very lightweight. I\'ve been running it in production for a few years. AdBlock blocks all URLs containing the word "ads". So this is what I did:I added a small js file to my webroot with the name ads.jsThis is the only line of code in that fileThen somewhere in my page:Files like ads.js are blocked by at least these adblockers on Chrome:(Yes, these are completely different browser extensions)This does not work with:Not a direct answer, but I\'d put the message behind the ad to be loaded... rather that trying to detect it, it\'d just show up when the ad doesn\'t.http://thepcspy.com/read/how_to_block_adblock/With jQuery:Of course, you would need to have a landing page for AdblockNotice.html, and the .myTestAd class needs to reflect your actual ad containers. But this should work.EDITAs TD_Nijboer recommends, a better way is to use the :hidden (or :visible, as I use below) selector so that display: none is also checked:Of course, both of these could be combined into one if block if desired.Note that visibility: hidden will not be captured by either as well (where the layout space stays, but the ad is not visible). To check that, another filter can be used:Which will give you an array of ad elements which are "invisible" (with any being greater than 0 being a problem, in theory).No extra requests. No external libraries. Just plain, simple JavaScript:Credit to Christian Heilmann\'s post, I think it\'s by far the best solution for detecting AdBlock.Most ads are dynamically loaded in javascript.  I just used the onerror event to detect whether the ad script could be loaded or not.  Seems to work.Example with GoogleAds:This can be used on other elements as well to see if an ad blocker is blocking the content.  This method can produce false positives if the remote elements doesn\'t exist or cannot be reached.To detect if the user is blocking ads, all you have to do is find a function in the ad javascript and try testing for it. It doesn\'t matter what method they\'re using to block the ad. Here\'s what it looks like for Google Adsense ads:This method is outlined here: http://www.metamorphosite.com/detect-web-popup-blocker-software-adblock-spamI know there are already enough answers, but since this question comes up on Google searched for "detect adblock" at the topic, I wanted to provide some insight in case you\'re not using adsense.Specifically, with this example you can detect if the default Adblock-list provided by Firefox Adblock is used. It takes advantage that in this blocklist there is an element blocked with the CSS id #bottomAd. If I include such an element in the page and test for it\'s height, I know whether adblocking is active or not:The rest is done via the usual jQuery suspect:As can be seen, I\'m using setTimeout with at least a timeout of 1ms. I\'ve tested this on various browsers and most of the time, directly checking for the element in ready always returned 0; no matter whether the adblocker was active or not. I was having two ideas about this: either rendering wasn\'t yet done or Adblock didn\'t kick in yet. I didn\'t bother to investigate further.My easiest solution with jquery is:advertisement.js just contains nothing. When somebody uses adblock, it fails and the function gets called.They\'re utilizing the fact that Google\'s ad code creates an iframe with the id "iframe".  So as long as you don\'t already have something on your page with that ID, this\'d work for you too.I noticed previous comments uses google adsense as object to test. Some pages don\'t uses adsense, and using adsense block as test is not really a good idea. Because adsense block may harm your SEO. \nHere is example how I detect by adblocker simple blocked class:Html:Jquery:"ablockercheck" is an ID which adblocker blocks. So checking it if it is visible you are able to detect if adblocker is turned On.AdBlock seems to block the loading of AdSense (etc) JavaScript files. So, if you are using asynchronous version of AdSense ads you can check if adsbygoogle is an Array. This must be checked after few seconds since the asynchronous script is... asynchronous. Here is a rough outline:To clarify, here is an example of what the AdSense asynchronous ads code looks like:Notice that adsbygoogle is initialized as an Array. The adsbygoogle.js library changes this array into Object {push: ...} when it executes. Checking the type of variable after a certain time can tell you if the script was loaded.Just add small script on your site:With name adsbygoogle.jsThen do following:Found this solution hereThis approach I use on my site, maybe you will find it helpful. In my opinion, it\'s the simpliest solution.AdBlocker blocks specific classes and html elements, by inspecting these selectors of any blocked ads in developer console (they are all listed) you can see which elements will be always blocked. E.g. just inspect this question page on stackoverflow and you will see bunch of blocked ads.For example, any element with bottom-ad class is automatically blocked.If value is true, then AdBlocker is active.You don\'t need an extra HTTP request , you may simply calculate the height of a fake add.By the way, here is a full list matching the elements that adblockers avoid rendering.My advice is: don\'t do it!Any scenario where you treat people as "wrongdoers" is going to result in them fighting back.Here\'s my proposal.Put a small unobtrusive message at the top of the page (regardless of whether ads are being blocked) with the text I *totally* respect your right to block ads and a link to another page/pop-up entitled Read more ....On the other page, make it clear that you understand it\'s their computer and they are free to use ad blocking.Also make it clear in a non-accusatory way that the use of these blockers makes it more difficult for you to deliver great content (explaining why in detail) and that, while you\'d prefer the ad blocking to not happen on your site, it\'s totally their decision. Focus on the positives of turning off blocking.Those who are vehemently opposed to ads will ignore this but you never stood a chance of convincing them anyway. Those who are indifferent may well be swayed by your appeal since you\'re not doing the whole "let me get my way or I\'ll take my ball and go home" thing that honestly should be the exclusive domain of five year old children.Remember, no-one held a gun to your head and forced you to put your stuff on the net. Treat your readership/users with respect and you\'ll probably find a good number of them will reciprocate.If using the new AdSense code, you can do an easy check, with out resorting to content or css checks.Place your ads as normal in your markup:Then you call the adsense code at the bottom of your page (note do not use the "async" flag when calling the adsbygoogle.js script):Then add this little snippit of code below that:AdSense always creates/sets the flag adsbygoogle.loaded to true when the ads are loaded,  You could place the check in a setTimeout function to delay the check by a few seconds.the safe way is to wrap your ads inside <div> and check the heightit work with adblock plus and bluehell firewall.An efficient way to check if there is an adblock: \nSimply check if there is adblock enabled by trying to trigger the URL of google ads. If yes then run the callback_has_adblock, if not then run the callback_no_adblock. This solution costs one request more but at least it works:This solution works for all kind of ads, not only google adsense.Despite the age of this question, I recently found it very useful and therefore can only assume there are others still viewing it. After looking here and elsewhere I surmised that the main three client side checks for indirectly detecting an ad blocker were to check for blocked  div/img, blocked iframes and blocked resources (javascript files).Maybe it\'s over the top or paranoid but it covers for ad blocking systems that block only one or two out of the selection and therefore may not have been covered had you only done the one check.On the page your are running the checks add: (I am using jQuery)and add the following anywhere else on the page:I used a div with a bait name as well as an externally hosted image with the text "Advert" and in dimensions used by AdSense (thanks to placehold.it!).In advertisement.js you should append something to the document which we can check for later. Although it seems like you\'re doing the same as before, you are actually checking for the file (advertisement.js) itself being loaded, not the output.And then the ad blocker detection script which combines everythingWhen the document is ready, i.e. the markup is loaded, we add the iframe to the document also. Then, when the window is loaded, i.e. the content incl. images etc. is loaded, we check:And the styles:Hope this helpsI know this is already answered, but I looked at the suggested sample site, and I see they do it like this:No need for timeouts and DOM sniffing. Simply attempt to load a script from popular ad networks, and see if the ad blocker intercepted the HTTP request.Just created my own "plugin" for solving this and it works really well:adBuddy + jsBuddy: ADBuddy JSBuddy GitHubI added mobile compatibility and jsBlocking detection among other things... (Like an overlay that is shown to the users asking them to disable the adBlocking/jsBlocking software); Also made it responsive friendly.It\'s opensourced under the Coffeeware License.and in getbanner.cfm file:I think it\'s easiest way to detect adblock.This is what worked for me:timing\'s answer is nice thinked but no more working, so I have updated the name of the js file to \'adsense\' from \'ads\' and it is working back like a charm!Here is the code, maybe this wil help someone:In the Js file put just this line: var adblockDetecter = true;Now there\'s a better way to do it using a simple JS script called AdBlock Detector \nHere\'s how to use it:\nAdd this to your <head> section:Now you can use the ab-message id wherever you want to display a message to AdBlock users:Note the inline style added to hide it originally (Of course, you can also do this from your own CSS file). \nAlso note that it takes 500ms, that\'s because it has to wait for the adblocker to do its thing or it won\'t work.First, it appends an iframe with a source of a randomly generated link. (It is randomly generated because some adblocks are smart, at some point, they realize a link is fake). \nThen it runs multiple checks on that iframe (if it was loaded successfully or if its style was modified). If one of these tests is true, it then displays the ab-message element to adblock users.This script works for most (if not all) ad blockers.No point, really, could have just created a gist, but instead I created a Github project, but still, check it out and star it if it helped you.abDetector: Simple vanilla JavaScript AdBlock Detector.\nEnjoy.You can check this out it might help\ndetect-adblockerIts an implementation of timing answerAdd this before any script in the head tag:Then later use it:I understand your tension and you can check if element has been created by script or element is hidden. And if we speak about ad-blocking you can count only on the element visibility, not on the element presence. Element created with third-party script will never be present, that if script is not reachable at the moment (DNS error, remote web server error, offline web page preload, etc), and you\'ll always get false positive.All other answers with checks are correct, but keep this in mind.I\'m a bit late to the party here but here\'s the simplest solution I know for the old AdSense code with jQuery:And in plain JavaScript:For $ads you can use any selector that you know is consistent with the ad being generated. E.g. for the new AdSense code you can use $("iframe#google_ads_frame1").If you have problem with adblock blocking new tab in browser you can do something like this:This code is ONLY useful IF you don\'t want to block entire site AND just tell users why their browser tabs are closed ;)
