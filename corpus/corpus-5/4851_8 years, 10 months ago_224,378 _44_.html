In Vim, how would I go about inserting characters at the beginning of each line in a selection?For instance, let\'s say I want to comment out a block of code by prepending \'//\' at the beginning of each line (assuming my language\'s comment system doesn\'t allow block commenting like /* */).  How would I do this?This replaces the beginning of each line with "//":This replaces the beginning of each selected line (use visual mode to select) with "//":Note that gv (in normal mode) restores the last visual selection, this comes in handy from time to time.The general pattern for search and replace is:Replaces the first occurrence of \'search\' with \'replace\' for current lineReplaces all occurrences of \'search\' with \'replace\' for current line, \'g\' is short for \'global\'This command will replace each occurrence of \'search\' with \'replace\' for the current line only.  The % is used to search over the whole file.  To confirm each replacement interactively append a \'c\' for confirm:Interactive confirm replacing \'search\' with \'replace\' for the entire fileInstead of the % character you can use a line number range (note that the \'^\' character is a special search character for the start of line):Inserts a \'#\' character at the start of lines 14-20If you want to use another comment character (like //) then change your command delimiter:Inserts a \'//\' character sequence at the start of lines 14-20Or you can always just escape the // characters like:Inserts a \'//\' character sequence at the start of lines 14-20If you are not seeing line numbers in your editor, simply type the followingAnother way that might be easier for newcomers:Place the cursor on the first line, e.g. by: 1 Enterand type the following to get into insert mode and add your text:I / / SpacePress Esc to get back to command mode and use the digraph:j . j .j is a motion command to go down one line and . repeats the last editing command you made.And yet another way:This adds # at the beginning of every line:And people will stop complaining about your lack of properly commenting scripts.If you want to get super fancy about it, put this in your .vimrc:Then, whenever in visual mode, you can hit \\c to comment the block and \\u to uncomment it. Of course, you can change those shortcut keystrokes to whatever.Yet another way: /^/ is just a dummy pattern to match every line.  norm lets you run the normal-mode commands that follow.  I// says to enter insert-mode while jumping the cursor to the beginning of the line, then insert the following text (two slashes).  :g is often handy for doing something complex on multiple lines, where you may want to jump between multiple modes, delete or add lines, move the cursor around, run a bunch of macros, etc.  And you can tell it to operate only on lines that match a pattern.For commenting blocks of code, I like the NERD Commenter plugin.Select some text:Comment:Uncomment:Or just toggle the comment state of a line or block:I can recommend the EnhCommentify plugin.eg. put this to your vimrc:you can then comment/uncomment the (selected) lines with \',c\'Mark the area to be comment as a visual block (<C-V)and do c#<ESC>pIf you do it often, define a short cut (example \\q) in your .vimrc
