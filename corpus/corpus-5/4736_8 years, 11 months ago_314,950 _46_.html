I\'m looking for the equivalent of the unix \'tail\' command that will allow me to watch the output of a log file while it is being written to. I\'d suggest installing something like GNU Utilities for Win32.  It has most favourites, including tail.If you use PowerShell then this works: Posting Stefan\'s comment from below, so people don\'t miss it  PowerShell 3 introduces a -Tail parameter to include only the last x lines I\'ve always used Baretail for tailing in Windows. It\'s free and pretty nice.Edit: for a better description of Baretail see this questionYou can get tail as part of Cygwin.There are quite a number of options, however all of them have flaws with more advanced features.The Windows Server 2003 Tools provides a simple tail that can be downloaded with the Resource Kit Tools. It is too limited in many respects (locks followed file, lacks many options like --pid), however will do for the basic task of tracking a file.GnuWin32 tail is buggy (\xce\xb1 \xce\xb2 \xce\xb3) - things like -f just plain don\'t work.UnxUtils tail seems better (-f works, but --pid seems not to, -n but not --lines=n fails with -f), but appears to be a dead project.Cygwin is a big ugly mush, could perhaps just use the DLL and coreutils package - but still has problems like --pid not working with native win32 processes.Anybody interested in a DOS CMD tail using batch commands (see below)\nIts not prefect and lines sometime repeat.usage: tail.bat -d  \n       tail.bat -f -f I\'ve used Tail For Windows.  Certainly not as elegant as using I haven\'t seen Log Expert anywhere among answers here:http://www.log-expert.de/It\'s customizable and quite good for going around log files, so far it\'s the best windows graphical log viewer for me.If you do not want to install anything at all you can "build your own" batch file that does the job from standard Windows commands. Here are some pointers as to how to do it.1) Using find /c /v "" yourinput.file, get the number of lines in your input file. The output is something like:2) Using for /f, parse this output to get the number 15.3) Using set /a, calculate the number of head lines that needs to be skipped4) Using for /f "skip=n" skip the head lines and echo/process the tail lines.If I find the time, I will build such a batch file and post it back here.With Windows PowerShell you can use:Try Windows Services for UNIX. Provides shells, awk, sed, etc. as well as tail.Download the tail command, part of Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools from Microsoft itself.I prefer TailMe because of the possibility to watch several log files simultaneously in one window: http://www.dschensky.de/Software/Staff/tailme_en.htmDOS has no tail command; you can download a Windows binary for GNU tail and other GNU tools here.Another option would be to install MSYS (which is more leightweight than Cygwin).The tail command and many others are available in the Windows Resource Kit Tools package from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17657I just wrote this little batch script. It isn\'t as sophisticated as the unix "tail" but hopefully someone can add on to it to improve it, like limiting the output to the last 10 lines of the file, etc. If you do improve this script, please send it to me at robbing ~[at]~ gmail.com.If you want to use Win32 ports of some Unix utilities (rather than installing Cygwin), I recommend GNU utilities for Win32.Lighter weight than Cygwin and more portable.dos\'s type works like *nux\'s cat, though just like cat, it does dump the whole file, so its not really a true tail, but its going to be available in a pinch without downloading/installing a true tail substitute.install MKS tool kit.. so that you can run all unix commands in windows. tail -f   is the command.I\'ve used Mtail recently and it seems to work well. This is the GUI type like baretail mentioned above. I\'m using Kiwi Log Viewer, it\'s free.In Far Manager press F3 on a file to enter standard viewer, then End key to navigate to the end of file. If the file is updated - Far will scroll it automatically.you can try WinTail as well\nhttp://www.baremetalsoft.com/wintail/Graphical log viewers, while they might be very good for viewing log files, don\'t meet the need for a command line utility that can be incorporated into scripts (or batch files).  Often such a simple and general-purpose command can be used as part of a specialized solution for a particular environment.  Graphical methods don\'t lend themselves readily to such use.I think I have found a utility that meets the need for the tail function in batch files.  It\'s called "mtee", and it\'s free.  I\'ve incorporated it into a batch file I\'m working on and it does the job very nicely.  Just make sure to put the executable into a directory in the PATH statement, and away you go.Here\'s the link:mtee
