I want to convert these types of values, \'3\', \'2.34\', \'0.234343\', etc. to a number. In JavaScript we can use Number(), but is there any similar method available in PHP?You don\'t typically need to do this, since PHP will coerce the type for you in most circumstances. For situations where you do want to explicitly convert the type, cast it:There are a few ways to do so:Cast the strings to numeric primitive data types:Perform math operations on the strings:Use intval() or floatval():Use settype().In whatever (loosely-typed) language you can always cast a string to a number by adding a zero to it.However, there is very little sense in this as PHP will do it automatically at the time of using this variable, and it will be cast to a string anyway at the time of output.  Note that you may wish to keep dotted numbers as strings, because after casting to float it may be changed unpredictably, due to float numbers\' nature.You can use:Or you can use:To avoid problems try intval($var). Some examples:If you want get float for $value = \'0.4\', but int for $value = \'4\', you can write:Little bit dirty, but it works.You can use (int)_value_ for example.See Type Juggling.In PHP you can use intval(string) or floatval(string) functions to convert strings to numbers.Just a little note to the answers that can be useful and safer in some cases.\nYou may want to check if the string actually contains a valid numeric value first and only then convert it to a numeric type (for example if you have to manipulate data coming from a db that converts ints to strings). You can use is_numeric() and then floatval():I\'ve found that in JavaScript a simple way to convert a string to a number is to multiply it by 1. It resolves the concatenation problem, because the "+" symbol has multiple uses in JavaScript, while the "*" symbol is purely for mathematical multiplication.Based on what I\'ve seen here regarding PHP automatically being willing to interpret a digit-containing string as a number (and the comments about adding, since in PHP the "+" is purely for mathematical addition), this multiply trick works just fine for PHP, also.I have tested it, and it does work... Although depending on how you acquired the string, you might want to apply the trim() function to it, before multiplying by 1.Instead of having to choose weather to convert the string to int or float. You can simply add a 0 to it and PHP will automatically convert the result to a numeric type.Here is a function I wrote to simplify things for myself:It also returns shorthand versions of boolean, integer, double and real.Calling type with parseNumeric set to true will convert numeric strings before checking type.Thus:type("5", true) will return inttype("3.7", true) will return floattype("500") will return stringJust be careful since this is a kind of false checking method and your actual variable will still be a string. You will need to convert the actual variable to the correct type if needed. I just needed it to check if the database should load an item id or alias, thus not having any unexpected effects since it will be parsed as string at run time anyway.EditIf you would like to detect if objects are functions add this case to the switch:You can use this to convert a string to an int in PHP.Try using something like this:you can convert a string to a number in PHP using cast .You can always add zero to it!In addition to Boykodev answer I suggest this:You can change the data type as followsFor historical reasons "double" is returned in case of a float.PHP DocumentationYou can use:But the best solution is to use:OrFor your specific case, you could just multiply by 1 to convert string to number in php. PHP takes care of the floating and integer automatically. PHP will do it for you within limitsall suggestions loose the numeric type\nthis seems to me a best practiceHere is the function that achieves what you are looking for. First we check if the value can be understood as a number, if so we turn it into an int and a float.  If the int and float are the same (e.g., 5 == 5.0) then we return the int value.  If the int and float are not the same (e.g., 5 != 5.3) then we assume you need the precision of the float and return that value.  If the value isn\'t numeric we throw a warning and return null.Different Approach:
