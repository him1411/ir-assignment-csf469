I\'m trying to install PyQt4 so I can mess around with it. The installation guide said I had to install Sip. The last step to installing Sip is to use the make install command. Windows doesn\'t have that, so I looked it up and everything I saw said to install Cygwin. So I did. But...sip is in C:\\Python31\\sip.Can I run this from the Cygwin command? If so, how would I do that?Or can I run this from the normal windows command prompt?  If so, how would I go about that?Use:I\'ll add something that helps me out a lot with cygwin.  Whenever setting up a new system, I always do thisThis creates a symbolic link to /cygdrive/c with a new file called /c (in the home directory) Then you can do this in your shellVery handy.cd c: is supported now in cygwinYou already accepted an answer, but I just thought I\'d mention that the following also works in Cygwin:I think the cd /cygdrive/c method is better, but sometimes it\'s useful to know that you can do this too.As you\'ll probably want to do this often, add aliases into your .bashrc file, like:Then you can just type on the command line:On a related note, you may also like:This allows you to cd a dir by just typing in the dirTo make is persistent you should add it to your ~/.bashrcDefine a variable in .bashrc :then you can useand the tab autocompletes correctly (please include the / at the end)you can try thisYou can just use cd C:/Users/../..Create a file named "overrideBashCdForWindowsPaths" in your HOME folder. Paste the following lines into that file and save it:Next, type the following command in a terminal, while you are in your HOME folder:Close your terminal and open a new one. You can now easily change into that Windows folder by simply typingThe script reads the last command, extracts the path and passes it to Cygwin\'s path-conversion tool. By naming the function "cd" we sort of \'override\' Bash\'s builtin "cd" and delegate the actual call to it in the very last line.Something that is worth mentioning here is that Cygwin\'s cygpath, still does not handle spaced Windows paths properly, especially in Bash scripts running under Cygwin. The trick is to understand how Cygwin interprets quotes in Bash scripts.The following does not work:But this does work:As far as I know, there is currently no known workaround using cygpath, that can properly handle spaces in the bash scripting context but you can use quotes in your scripts.
