As the question says, how do I add a new option to a DropDownList using jQuery?ThanksWithout using any extra plugins,If you had lots of options, or this code needed to be run very frequently, then you should look into using a DocumentFragment instead of modifying the DOM many times unnecessarily. For only a handful of options, I\'d say it\'s not worth it though.------------------------------- Added --------------------------------DocumentFragment is good option for speed enhancement, but we cannot create option element using document.createElement(\'option\') since IE6 and IE7 are not supporting it.What we can do is, create a new select element and then append all options. Once loop is finished, append it to actual DOM object.This way we\'ll modify DOM for only one time!With no plug-ins, this can be easier without using as much jQuery, instead going slightly more old-school:If you want to specify whether or not the option a) is the default selected value, and b) should be selected now, you can pass in two more parameters:With the plugin: jQuery Selection Box. You can do this:You may want to clear your DropDown first\n    $(\'#DropDownQuality\').empty();I had my controller in MVC return a select list with only one item.Add item to list in the beginingAdd item to list in the endCommon Dropdown operation (Get, Set, Add, Remove) using jQueryPease note @Phrogz\'s solution doesn\'t work in IE 8 while @nickf\'s works in all major browsers. Another approach is:U can use direct$"(.ddlClassName").Html("<option selected=\\"selected\\" value=\\"1\\">1</option><option value=\\"2\\">2</option>") -> Here u can use direct stringAnd also, use .prepend() to add the option to the start of the options list.\nhttp://api.jquery.com/prepend/using jquery you can usewhere "myid" is the id of the dropdown list and newvalue is the text that you want to insert..I needed to add as many options to dropdowns as there were dropdowns on my page.  So I used it in this way:This dynamically set up dropdowns with values like 1 to n, and automatically selected the value for the order that dropdown was in (i.e. 2nd dropdown got "2" in the box, etc.).It was ridiculous that I could not use this or this.Object or $.obj or anything like that in my 2nd .each(), though --- I actually had to get the specific ID of that object and then grab and pass that whole object to my function before it would append.  Fortunately the ID of my dropdown was separated by a "_" and I could grab it.  I don\'t feel I should have had to, but it kept giving me jQuery exceptions otherwise.  Something others struggling with what I was might enjoy knowing.try this Function:
