I have 2 divs: one in the left side and one in the right side of my page. The one in the left side has fixed width and I want the one of the right side to fill the remaining space.The one on the right side is the navigation and I want it to to fill the remaining space on it right side:My CSS:My Html:Thank in advance!This seems to accomplish what you\'re going for.The problem that I found with Boushley\'s answer is that if the right column is longer than the left it will just wrap around the left and resume filling the whole space. This is not the behavior I was looking for. After searching through lots of \'solutions\' I found this awesome tutorial on creating three column pages. The author offer\'s three different ways, one fixed width, one with three variable columns and one with fixed outer columns and a variable width middle. Much more elegant and effective than other examples I found. Significantly improved my understanding of CSS layout.Basically, in the simple case above, float the first column left and give it a fixed width. Then give the column on the right a left-margin that is a little wider than the first column. That\'s it. Done. Ala Boushley\'s code:http://jsfiddle.net/CSbbM/With Boushley\'s example the left column holds the other column to the right. As soon as the left column ends the right begins filling the whole space again. Here the right column simply aligns further into the page and the left column occupies it\'s big fat margin. No flow interactions needed.  The solution comes from the display property.Basically you need to make the two divs act like table cells. So instead of using float:left, you\'ll have to use display:table-cell on both divs, and for the dynamic width div you need to set width:auto; also. The both divs should be placed into a 100% width container with the display:table property.Here is the css:And the HTML:IMPORTANT:For Internet Explorer you need to specify the float property on the dynamic width div, otherwise the space will not be filled.I hope that this will solve your problem. \nIf you want, you can read the full article I wrote about this on my blog.Since this is a rather popular question, I\'m inclined to share a nice solution using BFC.\nCodepen sample of the following here.In this case, overflow: auto triggers context behavior and makes the right element expand only to the available remaining width and it will naturally expand to full width if .left disappears. A highly useful and clean trick for many UI layouts, but perhaps hard to understand the "why it works" at first.Now, use flex-box method (may be adapt to all browsers with -prefix-)More info: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/@Boushley\'s answer was the closet, however there is one problem not addressed that has been pointed out. The right div takes the entire width of the browser; the content takes the expected width. To see this problem better:http://jsfiddle.net/79hpS/The content is in the correct place (in firefox), however, the width incorrect. When child elements start inheriting width (e.g. the table with width: 100%) they are given a width equal to that of the browser causing them to overflow off the right of the page and create a horizontal scrollbar (in firefox) or not float and be pushed down (in chrome).You can fix this easily by adding overflow: hidden to the right column. This gives you the correct width for both the content and the div. Furthermore, the table will receive the correct width and fill the remaining width available.I tried some of the other solutions above, they didn\'t work fully with certain edge cases and were just too convoluted to warrant fixing them. This works and it\'s simple.If there are any problems or concerns, feel free to raise them. Thanks!If you don\'t need compatibility with older versions of certain browsers (IE 10 8 or less for example) you can use the calc() CSS function:Here is a little fix for accepted solution, which prevents right column from falling under the left column. Replaced width: 100%; with overflow: hidden; a tricky solution, if somebody didn\'t know it.http://jsfiddle.net/MHeqG/2600/[edit] Also check an example for three column layout:\n http://jsfiddle.net/MHeqG/3148/Boushley\'s answer seems to be the best way to go in order to arrange this using floats. However, it isn\'t without its problems. Nested floating within the expanded element will not be available to you; it will break the page.The method shown basically "fakes it" when it comes to the expanding element - it isn\'t actually floating, it\'s just playing along with the fixed-width floated elements using its margins.The problem then is exactly that: the expanding element isn\'t floated. If you try and have any nested floating within the expanding element, those "nested" floated items aren\'t really nested at all; when you try to stick a clear: both; under your "nested" floated items, you\'ll end up clearing the top-level floats as well.Then, to use Boushley\'s solution, I\'d like to add that you should place a div such as the following:\n    .fakeFloat\n    {\n       height: 100%;\n       width: 100%;\n       float: left;\n    }\nand place this directly within the expanded div; all the expanded div\'s contents should go then within this fakeFloat element.For this reason, I\'d recommend using tables in this specific case. Floated elements really aren\'t designed to do the expansion that you\'d like, whereas the solution using a table is trivial. An argument is generally made that floating is more proper for layouts, not tables.. but you aren\'t using floating here anyways, you\'re faking it - and that sort of defeats the purpose of the stylistic argument for this specific case, in my humble opinion.Use display:flexI tried the above solutions for a liquid left, and a fixed right but non of them worked (I am aware the question is for the reverse but I think this is relevant). Here\'s what did work:I had a similar problem and I found the solution here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/16909141/3934886The solution is for a fixed center div and liquid side columns.If you want a fixed left column, just change the formula accordingly.If you are trying to fill remaining space in a flexbox between 2 items, add the following class to a an empty div between the 2 you want to seperate:Tried all of these answers and none of them worked (Mihai\'s almost did, so +1 there, but I needed a larger inner element, so it broke).Best solution (as of the date of this answer) remains: Use jQuery to set your div widths at runtime, using a pre-set constant for your fixed-width div size. You will save yourself a lot of headaches./*\n * css\n *//*\n * html\n */I have a very simple solution for this !\n//HTML//CSSLink: http://jsfiddle.net/MHeqG/I had a similar issue and came up with the following which worked wellCSS:HTML:This method won\'t wrap when the window is shrunk but will auto expand the \'content\' area. It will keep a static width for the site menu (left).And for auto expanding content box and left vertical box(site menu) demo:https://jsfiddle.net/tidan/332a6qte/Try adding position relative, remove width and float properties of the right side, then add left and right property with 0 value.Also, you can add margin left rule with the value is based on the left element\'s width (+ some pixels if you need space in between) to maintain its position.This example is working for me:Try this. It worked for me.I wonder that no one used position: absolute with position: relativeSo, another solution would be:HTMLCSSJsfiddle examplenew to css. But I solved this problem by using inline-block. check this out: http://learnlayout.com/inline-block.htmlI ran into this same problem trying to layout some jqueryUI controls.  Although the common philosophy now is "use DIV instead of TABLE", I found in my case using TABLE worked much better.  In particular, if you need to have straightforward alignment within the two elements (e.g., vertical centering, horizontal centering, etc.) the options available with TABLE give simple, intuitive controls for this.  Here\'s my solution:
