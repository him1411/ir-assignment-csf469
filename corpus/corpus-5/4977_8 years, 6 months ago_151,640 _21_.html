I added a navigation control to switch between views in my app. But some of the views shouldn\'t have \'Back\' (the previous title) button. Any ideas about how to hide the back button?Objective-C:\n    self.navigationItem.hidesBackButton = YES;Swift:\n    navigationItem.hidesBackButton = trueThe best way is to combine these, so it will hide the back button even if you set it up manually : hide back button with bellow code...or Also if you have custom UINavigationBar then try bellow codeUse the code:In Swift:  Add this to the controller In the function viewDidLoad of the UIViewController use the code:Don\'t forget that you need to call it on the object that has the nav controller. For instance, if you have nav controller pushing on a tab bar controller with a RootViewController, calling self.navigationItem.hidesBackButton = YES on the RootViewController will do nothing. You would actually have to call self.tabBarController.navigationItem.hidesBackButton = YESDon\'t forget that we have the slide to back gesture now. You probably want to remove this as well. Don\'t forget to enable it back again if necessary.Add this code in your view controllerFor me none of the above seemed to work, It had no visual effect. I am using storyboards with a view that is "embedded" in a navigation controller.I then at code level add my menuItems and for some reason the "backButton" is visible when visually debugging the view hierarchy, and my menuItem Icon is displayed beneath the invisible "back button".I tried the settings, as suggested at the various hook methods and that had no effect. Then I tried a more brutal approach and iterate over the subview which also had no effect.I inspected my icon sizes and appeared to be ok.\nAfter referring to he apple Human Interface Guideline I confirmed my Icons are correct. (1 pixel smaller in my case 24px 48px 72px).The strangest part then is the actual fix...When adding the BarButton Item give it a title with at least one character, In my case a space character.Hopes this helps someone.
