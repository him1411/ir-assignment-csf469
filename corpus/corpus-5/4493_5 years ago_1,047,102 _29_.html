Consider:Is this how you create a two-dimensional array with 5 rows and 10 columns?I saw this code online, but the syntax didn\'t make sense.Try the following:... which is a short hand for something like this:Note that every element will be initialized to the default value for int, 0, so the above are also equivalent to:We can declare a two dimensional array and directly store elements at the time of its declaration as:Here int represents integer type elements stored into the array and the array name is \'marks\'. int is the datatype for all the elements represented inside the "{" and "}" braces because an array is a collection of elements having the same data type. Coming back to our statement written above: each row of elements should be written inside the curly braces. The rows and the elements in each row should be separated by a commas.Now observe the statement: you can get there are 3 rows and 5 columns, so the JVM creates 3 * 5 = 15 blocks of memory. These blocks can be individually referred ta as:\nNOTE:\nIf you want to store n elements then the array index starts from zero and ends at n-1.\nAnother way of creating a two dimensional array is by declaring the array first and then allotting memory for it by using new operator.By combining the above two we can write:You can create them just the way others have mentioned. One more point to add: You can even create a skewed two-dimensional array with each row, not necessarily having the same number of collumns, like this:The most common idiom to create a two-dimensional array with 5 rows and 10 columns is:Alternatively, you could use the following, which is more similar to what you have, though you need to explicitly initialize each row:Try:Note that in your code only the first line of the 2D array is initialized to 0.\nLine 2 to 5 don\'t even exist. If you try to print them you\'ll get null for everyone of them.In Java, a two-dimensional array can be declared as the same as a one-dimensional array. In a one-dimensional array you can write likewhere int is a data type, array[] is an array declaration, and new array is an array with its objects with five indexes.Like that, you can write a two-dimensional array as the following.Here array is an int data type. I have firstly declared on a one-dimensional array of that types, then a 3 row and 4 column array is created.In your codemeans that you have created a two-dimensional array, with five rows. In \nthe first row there are 10 columns. In Java you can select the column size for every row as you desire.It is also possible to declare it the following way. It\'s not good design, but it works.Enjoy!Try this Way:These types of Array known as Jagged Array in Java :In this scenario each row of array holds the different-different no of columns. In above example first row will holds 3 columns and 2nd row will holds 2 columns and 3rd row holds 5 columns. you can initialize this array at compile time like below :You can easily iterate all elements from your Array :
