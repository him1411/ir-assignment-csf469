I have a fluid width container DIV.Within this I have 4 DIVs all 300px x 250px...What I want to happen is box 1 to be floated left, box 4 to be floated right and box 2 and 3 to be spaced evenly between them.  I want the spacing to be fluid as well so as the browser is made smaller the space becomes smaller also.See: http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/EDp8R/The extra span (.stretch) can be replaced with :after.This still works in all the same browsers as the above solution. :after doesn\'t work in IE6/7, but they\'re using distribute-all-lines anyway, so it doesn\'t matter.See: http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/EDp8R/3/There\'s a minor downside to :after: to make the last row work perfectly in Safari, you have to be careful with the whitespace in the HTML.Specifically, this doesn\'t work:And this does:You can use this for any arbitrary number of child divs without adding a boxN class to each one by changingtoThis selects any div that is the first child of the #container div, and no others below it. To generalize the background colors, you can use the CSS3 nth-order selector, although it\'s only supported in IE9+ and other modern browsers:becomes:See here for a jsfiddle example.The easiest way to do this now is with a flexbox:http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/The CSS is then simply:demo: http://jsfiddle.net/QPrk3/However, this is currently only supported by relatively recent browsers (http://caniuse.com/flexbox).\nAlso, the spec for flexbox layout has changed a few times, so it\'s possible to cover more browsers by additionally including an older syntax:http://css-tricks.com/old-flexbox-and-new-flexbox/http://css-tricks.com/using-flexbox/If css3 is an option, this can be done using the css calc() function.Markup is simple - a bunch of divs with some container element.CSS looks like this:where -1px to fix an IE9+ calc/rounding bug - see hereHere, in addition to the calc() function, media queries are necessary.The basic idea is to set up a media query for each #columns states, where I then use calc() to work out the margin-right on each of the elements (except the ones in the last column).This sounds like a lot of work, but if you\'re using LESS or SASS this can be done quite easily (It can still be done with regular css, but then you\'ll have to do all the calculations manually, and then if you change your box width - you have to work out everything again)Below is an example using LESS: (You can copy/paste this code here to play with it, [it\'s also the code I used to generate the above mentioned fiddle])So basically you first need to decide a box-width and a minimum margin that you want between the boxes.With that, you can work out how much space you need for each state.Then, use calc() to calcuate the right margin, and nth-child to remove the right margin from the boxes in the final column.The advantage of this answer over the accepted answer which uses text-align:justify is that when you have more than one row of boxes - the boxes on the final row don\'t get \'justified\' eg: If there are 2 boxes remaining on the final row - I don\'t want the first box to be on the left and the next one to be on the right - but rather that the boxes follow each other in order.Regarding browser support: This will work on IE9+,Firefox,Chrome,Safari6.0+ - (see here for more details) However i noticed that on IE9+ there\'s a bit of a glitch between media query states. [if someone knows how to fix this i\'d really like to know :) ]    <-- FIXED HEREOther posts have mentioned flexbox, but if more than one row of items is necessary, flexbox\'s space-between property fails (see the end of the post)To date, the only clean solution for this is with theBasically the relevant code necessary boils down to this:1) Make the container element a grid container2) Set the grid with an \'auto\' amount of columns - as necessary. This is done for responsive layouts. The width of each column will be 120px.3) Set gaps/gutters for the grid rows and columns - here, since want a \'space-between\' layout - the gap will actually be a minimum gap because it will grow as necessary.4) and 5) - Similar to flexbox.Currently supported by Chrome (Blink) and Firefox, with partial support from IE and Edge (See this post by Rachel Andrew)\nFlexbox\'s space-between property works great for one row of items, but when applied to a flex container which wraps it\'s items - (with flex-wrap: wrap) - fails, because you have no control over the alignment of the last row of items;\nthe last row will always be justified (usually not what you want)To demonstrate:Codepen (Resize to see what i\'m talking about)Further reading on CSS grids:in jQuery you might target the Parent directly.THIS IS USEFUL IF YOU DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY CHILDREN WILL BE\n  ADDED DYNAMICALLY or IF YOU JUST CAN\'T FIGURE OUT THEIR NUMBER.This will let the parent grow horizontally as the children are beng added.NOTE: This assumes that the \'.children\' have a width and Height SetHope that Helps.If you know the number of elements per "row" and the width of the container you can use a selector to add a margin to the elements you need to cause a justified look.I had rows of three divs I wanted justified so used the: .tile:nth-child(3n+2) { margin: 0 10px }this allows the center div in each row to have a margin that forces the 1st and 3rd div to the outside edges of the containerAlso great for other things like borders background colors etcThis worked for me with 5 images in diferent sizes.This works because of justify-content:space-between, and it\'s on a list, displayed horizontally. On CSS       On htmlcenter the container div with margin 0 auto then from there add a margin left to box2 and a margin right to box 3 for your desired spaceThis way all the divs inside container are side by side and with margin you can control the spacing between the divs
