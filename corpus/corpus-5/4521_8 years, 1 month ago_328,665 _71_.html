How do you get the text of a TextView to be Justified (with text flush on the left- and right- hand sides)? I found a possible solution here, but it does not work (even if you change vertical-center to center_vertical, etc).I do not believe Android supports full justification.The @CommonsWare answer is correct. Android does not support "Full Justification" (or simply "Justification", as it is sometimes ambiguously referred to).However, android does support "Flush Left/Right Text Alignment". See the wikipedia article on Justification for the distinction. Many people consider the concept of \'justification\' to encompass full-justification as well as left/right text alignment, which is what they end up searching for when they want to do left/right text alignment. This answer explains how to achieve the left/right text alignment.It is possible achieve Flush Left/Right Text Alignment (not Full Justification, as the question is asking about). To demonstrate I will be using a basic 2-column form (labels in the left column and text fields in the right column) as an example. In this example the text in the labels in the left column will be right-aligned so they appear flush up against their text fields in the right column. In the XML layout you can get the TextView elements themselves (the left column) to align to the right by adding the following attribute inside all of the TextViews:However, if the text wraps to multiple lines, the text would still be flush left aligned inside the TextView. Adding the following attribute makes the actual text flush right aligned (ragged left) inside the TextView:So the gravity attribute specifies how to align the text inside the TextView layout_gravity specifies how to align/layout the TextView element itself.To justify text in android I used WebView and html.I can\'t yet upload images to prove it but "it works for me".We have created a simple class for this. There are currently two methods to achieve what you are looking for. Both require NO WEBVIEW and SUPPORTS SPANNABLES.LIBRARY: https://github.com/bluejamesbond/TextJustify-AndroidSUPPORTS: Android 2.0 to 5.X  SETUPSCREENSHOTYou can use JustifiedTextView for Android project in github. this is a custom view that simulate justified text for you. It support Android 2.0+ and right to left languages.\nI write a widget base on native textview to do it.githubXML Layout: declare WebView instead of TextViewJava code: set text data to WebViewThis may Solve your problem.\nIts Fully worked for me.Here\'s how I did it, I think the most elegant way I could. With this solution, the only things you need to do in your layouts are:Here\'s the code. Works perfectly fine on my phones (Galaxy Nexus Android 4.0.2, Galaxy Teos Android 2.1). Feel free, of course, to replace my package name with yours./assets/justified_textview.css:/res/values/attrs.xml:/res/layout/test.xml:/src/net/bicou/myapp/widget/JustifiedTextView.java:We need to set the rendering to software in order to get transparent background on Android 3+. Hence the try-catch for older versions of Android.Hope this helps!PS: please not that it might be useful to add this to your whole activity on Android 3+ in order to get the expected behavior:\nandroid:hardwareAccelerated="false"While still not complete justified text, you can now balance line lengths using android:breakStrategy="balanced" from API 23 onwardshttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android:breakStrategyTextView in Android O offers full justification (new typographic alignment) itself.You just need to do this,default is JUSTIFICATION_MODE_NONE.FILL_HORIZONTAL is equivalent to  CENTER_HORIZONTAL.\nYou can see this code snippet in textview\'s source code:I think there are two options:Use something like Pango that specializes in this via the NDK and render text to an OpenGL or other surface.Use Paint.measureText() and friends to get the lengths of words and lay them out manually on a Canvas in a custom view.I write my own class to solve this problem, Here it is \nJust you have to call the static justify function that takes two arguments //MainActivity//TextJustificationClass//XMLTry this solution in the below link just create that class in project folder and use it. it works fine for me :)Justify text in an Android app using a WebView but presenting a TextView-like interface?For html formating you don\'t need to call the Webkit, you could use Html.fromHtml(text) to do the job.Source : http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.htmlAndroid does not yet support full justification. We can use Webview and justify HTML instead of using textview. It works so fine. If you guys not clear, feel free to ask me :)  There is a CustomView for this problem, this custom text view is support Justified Text View.Loot at this: JustifiedTextViewAdd above class to your src folder and use this sample code to add to your layout:On android, to left justify text and not have truncation of the background color, try this, it worked for me, producing consistent results on android, ff, ie & chrome but you have to measure out the space that\'s left in between for the text when calculating the padding.The hack is the padding-right:1000px; that pushes the text to the extreme left.Any attempt to to a left or justify code in css or html results in a background that\'s only half width.I found a way to solve this problem, but this may not be very grace, but the effect is not bad.Its principle is to replace the spaces of each line to the fixed-width ImageSpan (the color is transparent).I put the code on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/twiceyuan/TextJustificationOverview:You have to setandThis doesn\'t really justify your text butis the best choice you have.Sincerly,\nWolfenTry using < RelativeLayout > (making sure to fill_parent), then just add android:layout_alignParentLeft="true" and android:layout_alignParentRight="true" to the elements you would like on the outside LEFT & RIGHT. BLAM, justified!
