This question already has an answer here:I have a project created by Maven integration in Eclipse. All work fine, but in the work space in all JSP files have this:To the first string where place:When I create a basic dynamic web project and JSP in - all is fine, no errors.Add a runtime first and select project properties. Then check the server name from the \'Runtimes\' tab as shown in the image.Include servlet-api-3.1.jar in your dependencies.MavenGradleProject \xe2\x86\x92 Properties \xe2\x86\x92 Target Runtimes \xe2\x86\x92 Apache Tomcat worked for me. There is no Target Runtimes under Facets (I\'m on Eclipse v4.2 (Juno)).Include servlet-api.jar from your server lib folder.Do this stepWhat is it?The servlet-api JAR file is a library which contains the interfaces and classes of the Servlet API specification. The servlet-api JAR file contains only the interface (the API) of the Servlet Specification, so you can use it to develop your web application.Where can you get it?It is provided at the link below:http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/servlet-3.0-fr-eval-oth-JSpec/Where it is contained/bundledServlet-api.jar is part of the Java EE download, so you can develop your web applications (you could not compile your FirstServlet class if the Java EE would not contain it).Servlet containers (like Tomcat, JBoss, GlassFish, etc.) also contain the servlet-api.jar, else they would not be able to run your web application, and moreover they also contain the implementation of the interfaces that are part of the Servlet API.The name is not always the same though, and it might not even exist as a separate JAR file, the Servlet API classes might be bundled in another JAR file.You can however download a separate JAR file containing only the Servlet API if you just want to develop a web application for a Servlet container, or if you want to create/write your own Servlet API implementation. Look at here:http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/servlet-3.0-fr-eval-oth-JSpec/PortabilityYou can compile your web application if you have the Servlet API, no matter where it comes from. After you compiled your web application, you can optionally pack it into a WAR file (WAR=Web ARchive) which is simply a ZIP file containing your static files, your compiled Java classes and configuration files like web.xml, etc. And you will be able to run your compiled web application in any Servlet containers.Project \xe2\x86\x92 Properties \xe2\x86\x92 Target Runtimes \xe2\x86\x92 *Apache Tomcat worked for me.

Unfortunately it seems this is a problem with Eclipse. I am able to remove all such errors from once working projects by picking just one of the dynamic web projects, or just tomcat dependent projects, and move a dependency in the build order. This seems to force all projects to rebuild properly and all of the errors are then resolved.Right click on a web project, select "build Path" -> "Configure Build Path".\nGo to the tab "Order and Export", then pick a library or jar entry and move it up or down. I used the JRE System Library and moved it to the top.Click OK, and all that red goes away!If you are not using Maven, just drop the javax.servlet-api.jar in your project lib folder.And if nothing works by whatever reason, build it from the command line:In case of JBoss... right click on project \xe2\x86\x92 Build Java path \xe2\x86\x92 add external JAR files.Then browse to jboss-folder \xe2\x86\x92 Common \xe2\x86\x92 lib \xe2\x86\x92 servlet-api.jar.\n.\nClick OK, refresh the project, and run it...
