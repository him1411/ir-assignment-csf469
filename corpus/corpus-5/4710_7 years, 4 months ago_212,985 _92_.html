Is it possible to change the language of an app programmatically while still using Android resources?If not, is it possible to request a resource in an specific language?I would like to let the user change the language of the app from the app.It\'s possible. You can set the locale. However, I would not recommend that. We\'ve tried it at early stages, it\'s basically fighting the system. We have the same requirement for changing the language but decided to settle to the fact that UI should be same as phone UI. It was working via setting locale but was too buggy. And you have to set it every time you enter activity (each activity) from my experience. here is a code if you still need this (again, I don\'t recommend that)If you have language specific content - you can change that base on the setting.It\'s really work... fa=Persian... en=English...\nenter your language code in languageToLoad :You can find an example hereI was looking for a way to change the system language programmatically.\nWhile I fully understand that a normal application should never do that and instead either:there was a need to really change the language of the system programmtically.This is undocumented API and thus should not be used for market/end-user applications!Anyway heres the solution i found:If you want to mantain the language changed over all your app you have to do two things.First, create a base Activity and make all your activities extend from this:Note that I save the new language in a sharedPreference.Second, create an extension of Application like this:Note that getLocale() it\'s the same as above.That\'s all!\nI hope this can help somebody.I am changed for German language for my app start itself.Here is my correct code. Anyone want use this same for me..\n(How to change language in android programmatically)my code:Just adding an extra piece that tripped me up.While the other answers work fine with "de" for exampleThe above wont work with for example "fr_BE" locale so it would use the values-fr-rBE folder or similar. Needs the following slight change to work with "fr_BE"If u write in every activity than no need to set it every time you enter activityCreate a class Extends "Application" and create a static method.\nThen you can call this method in all activities before "setContentView".}Usage in activities:}The only solution that fully works for me is a combination of Alex Volovoy\'s code with application restart mechanism:Change Language Programatically in Android Old answer\nThis include RTL/LTR support:I know it\'s late to answer but i found this article here\n. Which explains the whole process very well and provides you a well structured code.Locale Helper class:You need to override attachBaseContext and call LocaleHelper.onAttach() to initialize the locale settings in your application.All you have to do is to add     wherever you want to change the locale.I was facing the same issue. On GitHub I found the Android-LocalizationActivity library. This library makes it very simple to change the language of your app at runtime, as you can see in the code sample below. A sample project including the sample code below and more information can be found at the github page.The LocalizationActivity extends AppCompatActivity, so you can also use it when you are using Fragments.Important update:Note, that on SDK >= 21, you need to call \'Resources.updateConfiguration()\', otherwise resources will not be updated.Locale configuration should be set in each activity before setting the content - this.setContentView(R.layout.main);At first create multi string.xml for different languages; then use this block of code in onCreate() method:Alex Volovoy answer only works for me if it\'s in onCreate method of the activity.The answer that works in all the methods is in another thread Change language programmatically in AndroidHere is the adaptation of the codeHope that it helps.Take note that this solution using updateConfiguration will not be working anymore with the Android M release coming in a few weeks. The new way to do this is now using the applyOverrideConfigurationmethod from ContextThemeWrapper\nsee API docYou can find my full solution here since I faced the problem myself:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/31787201/2776572Time for a due update.First off, the deprecated list with the API in which it was deprecated:The thing no question answered recently has gotten right is the usage of the new method.createConfigurationContext is the new method for updateConfiguration.Some have used it standalone like this:... but that doesn\'t work. Why? The method returns a context, which then is used to handle Strings.xml translations and other localized resources (images, layouts, whatever).The proper usage is like this:If you just copy-pasted that into your IDE, you may see a warning that the API requires you targeting API 17 or above. This can be worked around by putting it in a method and adding the annotation @TargetApi(17)But wait. What about the older API\'s?You need to create another method using updateConfiguration without the TargetApi annotation.You don\'t need to return a context here.Now, managing these can be difficult. In API 17+ you need the context created (or the resources from the context created) to get the appropriate resources based on localization. How do you handle this?Well, this is the way I do it:This code works by having one method that makes calls to the appropriate method based on what API. This is something I have done with a lot of different deprecated calls (including Html.fromHtml). You have one method that takes in the arguments needed, which then splits it into one of two (or three or more) methods and returns the appropriate result based on API level. It is flexible as you do\'t have to check multiple times, the "entry" method does it for you. The entry-method here is setLanguagePLEASE READ THIS BEFORE USING ITYou need to use the Context returned when you get resources. Why? I have seen other answers here who use createConfigurationContext and doesn\'t use the context it returns. To get it to work like that, updateConfiguration has to be called. Which is deprecated. Use the context returned by the method to get resources.Example usage:Constructor or somewhere similar:And then, whereever you want to get resources you do:Using any other context will (in theory) break this.AFAIK you still have to use an activity context to show dialogs or Toasts. for that you can use an instance of an activity (if you are outside)And finally, use recreate() on the activity to refresh the content. Shortcut to not have to create an intent to refresh.There are some steps that you should implementFirst, you need to change the locale of your configurationSecond, if you want your changes to apply directly to the layout that is visible, you either can update the views directly or you can just call activity.recreate() to restart the current activity.And also you have to persist your changes because after user closes your application then you would lose the language change.I explained more detailed solution on my blog post Change Language Programmatically in AndroidBasically, you just call LocaleHelper.onCreate() on your application class and if you want to change locale on the fly you can call LocaleHelper.setLocale()similar to the accepted answered but 2017 version and added restart (without restarting, sometimes the next Activity still renders English):  First you create directory name values-"Language name" like  hindi than write "hi" and same string file name copy in this directory and change value do not change parameter after set below code in your action like button etc....This is working when i press button to change text language of my TextView.(strings.xml in values-de folder)Just handle in method Follow the LinkI think it is useful I encountered the same problem: I needed to set my language to a language chosen in my app.My fix was this:Example:From these XML\'s, you can still extract the needed strings to resources.It work for me
