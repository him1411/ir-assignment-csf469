Is there a function built into Java that capitalizes the first character of each word in a String, and does not affect the others?Examples:*(Old McDonald would be find too, but I don\'t expect it to be THAT smart.)A quick look at the Java String Documentation reveals only toUpperCase() and toLowerCase(), which of course do not provide the desired behavior. Naturally, Google results are dominated by those two functions. It seems like a wheel that must have been invented already, so it couldn\'t hurt to ask so I can use it in the future. WordUtils.capitalize(str) (from apache commons-lang)(Note: if you need "fOO BAr" to become "Foo Bar", then use capitalizeFully(..) instead)If you\'re only worried about the first letter of the first word being capitalized:The following method converts all the letters into upper/lower case, depending on their position near a space or other special chars.Try this very simple wayexample givenString="ram is good boy"Output will be: Ram Is Good BoyI\'ve written a small Class to capitalize all the words in a String. Optional multiple delimiters, each one with its behavior (capitalize before, after, or both, to handle cases like O\'Brian);Optional Locale; Don\'t breaks with Surrogate Pairs.LIVE DEMOOutput: Note: first letter will always be capitalized (edit the source if you don\'t want that).Please share your comments and help me to found bugs or to improve the code... Code:Using org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils make it very simple.Use the Split method to split your string into words, then use the built in string functions to capitalize each word, then append together. Pseudo-code (ish)In the end string looks something like\n"The Sentence You Want To Apply Caps To"This might be useful if you need to capitalize titles.

I ran across this problem tonight and decided to search it. I found an answer by Neelam Singh that was almost there so I decided to fix the issue (broke on empty strings) and causes system crash.  The method you are looking for is named capString(String s) below. \nIt turns "It\'s only 5am here" into "It\'s Only 5am Here". The code is pretty well commented, so enjoy. Cheers!package com.lincolnwdaniel.interactivestory.model;public class StringS {}I made a solution in Java 8 that is imho more readable.The Gist for this solution can be found here. https://gist.github.com/Hylke1982/166a792313c5e2df9d31I decided to add one more solution for capitalizing words in a string:Function:Example call:Result:Did you mean Title case?For those of you using Velocity in your MVC, you can use the capitalizeFirstLetter() method from the StringUtils class.The Short and Precise way is as follows: without error if you try and change the name value to the three of values .Error freethis one work for Surname case..\nwith different type of separator, and keep the same sepator\njean-frederic  --> Jean-Frederic\njean frederic  --> Jean Fredericthe code work with GWT client side.If you prefer Guava...try this I had a requirement to make a generic toString(Object obj) helper class function, where I had to convert the fieldnames into methodnames - getXXX() of the passed Object.
