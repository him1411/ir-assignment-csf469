I installed the latest version of the SDK (r21) and ADT 21.0.0. I tried simple code, and it works well, but now I get a warning in LogCat that did not appear in the previous versions:Unexpected value from nativeGetEnabledTags: 0I googled it, and I found Issue 39723: Emulator spams LogCat with "Unexpected value from nativeGetEnabledTags: 0" message.What does it mean?I just ran into this problem, too. As a workaround I\'m filtering the LogCat output with the following expression on the by Log Message field of the filter: Otherwise it is so spammed it\'s almost useless.Following  Laksh suggestion, if you want to filter this always without having to always write it on the Search for messages field:It\'s a bug in the emulator System Image for API 17.At the moment, your workarounds are the following:If you DON\'T need API level 17If you DO need API level 17The link which you referred to has the answer.\nIt is a bug introduced in the latest revision of the tools.\nIn the followup comments you can read that a google representative says a fix is on the way.Update the ARM EABI v7a System Image from Android SDK Manager and the warning wont be seen any more .. !! :)Yes. This works only for ARM EABI System Image and not for Intel image.UpdateSeems like there is a Update available for the Intel x86 Atom System Image for API 18 which fixes the issue (I have not tried it though). A link to manually install the system image. Ofcourse its also available in Android SDK Manager.But its only for Android 4.3.  The 4.2.x developers might still have to wait for a fix..!The problem with Intel x86 Atom images and "nativeGetEnabledTags: 0" is fixed with the release of the Android 4.3 (API 18) Intel x86 Atom image. I just tested it and can confirm that.With ARM images this was fixed some time ago, I know ...Since these mesasages are tagged with the Trace tag, you can use simpler expression to filter them by Log Tag field:  That\'s it.Btw, I also see these messages on the real device (Fly IQ4410). I was getting lots of similar messages, so I needed better filters. Add these filters to the LogCat:By log tag: By log message:I have added the ^(?!.*(nativeGetEnabledTags)).*$  filter, but you can see how few it helps me:from 1157 is filtered a few and 799 bypassed same ratio, but a bit bigger numbers:I needed to add the "SpamFilter" to be able to use the Logcat:by Log Tag:by Application Name: For me it made a bit usable the Logcat.
