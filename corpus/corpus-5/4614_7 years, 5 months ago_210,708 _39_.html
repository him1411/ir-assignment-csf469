My app needs to show Google Maps directions from A to B, but I don\'t want to put the Google Maps into my application - instead, I want to launch it using an Intent. Is this possible? If yes, how?You could use something like this:To start the navigation from the current location, remove the saddr parameter and value.You can use an actual street address instead of latitude and longitude. However this will give the user a dialog to choose between opening it via browser or Google Maps.This will fire up Google Maps in navigation mode directly:UPDATEIn May 2017 Google launched the new API for universal, cross-platform Google Maps URLs:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/urls/guideYou can use Intents with the new API as well.This is a little off-topic because you asked for "directions", but you can also use the Geo URI scheme described in the Android Documentation:http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/g-app-intents.htmlThe problem using "geo:latitude,longitude" is that Google Maps only centers at your point, without any pin or label.That\'s quite confusing, especially if you need to point to a precise place or/and ask for directions.If you use the query parameter "geo:lat,lon?q=name" in order to label your geopoint, it uses the query for search and dismiss the lat/lon parameters.I found a way to center the map with lat/lon and display a pin with a custom label, very nice to display and useful when asking for directions or any other action:NOTE (by @TheNail): Not working in Maps v.7 (latest version at the time of writing). Will ignore the coordinates and search for an object with the given name between the parentheses. See also Intent for Google Maps 7.0.0 with locationAlthough the current answers are great, none of them did quite what I was looking for, I wanted to open the maps app only, add a name for each of the source location and destination, using the geo URI scheme wouldn\'t work for me at all and the maps web link didn\'t have labels so I came up with this solution, which is essentially an amalgamation of the other solutions and comments made here, hopefully it\'s helpful to others viewing this question.To use your current location as the starting point (unfortunately I haven\'t found a way to label the current location) then use the followingFor completeness, if the user doesn\'t have the maps app installed then it\'s going to be a good idea to catch the ActivityNotFoundException, then we can start the activity again without the maps app restriction, we can be pretty sure that we will never get to the Toast at the end since an internet browser is a valid application to launch this url scheme too.P.S.\nAny latitudes or longitudes used in my example are not representative of my location, any likeness to a true location is pure coincidence, aka I\'m not from Africa :PWell you can try to open the built-in application Android Maps by using the Intent.setClassName method.Using the latest cross-platform Google Maps URLs:\nEven if google maps app is missing it will open in browserExample https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=81.23444,67.0000&destination=80.252059,13.060604try thisThis is what worked for me:First you need to now that you can use the implicit intent, android documentation provide us with a very detailed common intents \nfor implementing the map intent you need to create a new intent with two parametersFor action we can use Intent.ACTION_VIEW \nand for Uri we should Build it ,below i attached  a sample code to create,build,start the activity.For multiple way points, following can be used as well.First set of coordinates are your starting location. All of the next are way points, plotted route goes through.Just keep adding way points by concating "/latitude,longitude" at the end. There is apparently a limit of 23 way points according to google docs. Not sure if that applies to Android too.if you know point A, point B (and whatever features or tracks in between) you can use a KML file along with your intent.for more info, see this SO answerNOTE: this example uses a sample file that (as of mar13) is still online.  if it has gone offline, find a kml file online and change your urlIf you interested in showing the Latitude and Longitude from the current direction , you can use this :Directions are always given from the users current location.The following query will help you perform that . You can pass the destination latitude and longitude here: Use above as: Or if you want to show via location , use:More Info here: \nGoogle Maps Intents for Android
