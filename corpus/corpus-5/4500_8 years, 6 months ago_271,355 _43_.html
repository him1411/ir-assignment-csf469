How do I split a string with multiple separators in JavaScript?  I\'m trying to split on both commas and spaces but, AFAIK, JS\'s split function only supports one separator.Pass in a regexp as the parameter:Edited to add:You can get the last element by selecting the length of the array minus 1:... and if the pattern doesn\'t match:You can pass a regex into Javascript\'s split operator. For example:Or, if you want to allow multiple separators together to act as one only:(You have to use the non-capturing (?:) parens because otherwise it gets spliced back into the result. Or you can be smart like Aaron and use a character class.)(Examples tested in Safari + FF)Tricky method:Another simple but cheap and nasty method is to use split + join repeatedly.Essentially doing a split followed by a join is like a global replace so this replaces each separator with a comma then once all are replaced it does a final split on commaThe result of the above expression is:Expanding on this you could also place it in a function:Usage: If you use this functionality a lot it might even be worth considering wrapping    String.prototype.split for convenience (I think my function is fairly safe - the only consideration is the additional overhead of the conditionals (minor) and the fact that it lacks an implementation of the limit argument if an array is passed).Be sure to include the splitMulti function if using this approach to the below simply  wraps it :). Also worth noting that some people frown on extending built-ins (as many people do it wrong and conflicts can occur) so if in doubt speak to someone more senior before using this or ask on SO :) Usage:Enjoy!Lets keep it simple: (add a "[ ]+" to your RegEx means "1 or more")For those of you who want more customization in their splitting function, I wrote a recursive algorithm that splits a given string with a list of characters to split on. I wrote this before I saw the above post. I hope it helps some frustrated programmers.Example above returns: ["people", "and", "other", "things"]Note: flatten function was taken from Rosetta Code You could just lump all the characters you want to use as separators either singularly or collectively into a regular expression and pass them to the split function. For instance you could write:And the output will be:Perhaps you should do some sort of string replace to turn one separator into the other separator so you then only have one separator to deal with in your split.Hi for example if you have split and replace in String 07:05:45PM ResultI find that one of the main reasons I need this is to split file paths on both / and \\. It\'s a bit of a tricky regex so I\'ll post it here for reference:I think it\'s easier if you specify what you wanna leave, instead of what you wanna remove.As if you wanna have only English words, you can use something like this:Examples (run snippet):Starting from @stephen-sweriduk solution (that was the more interesting to me!), I have slightly modified it to make more generic and reusable:and thenthat gives back as the original:I don\'t know the performance of RegEx, but here is another alternative for RegEx leverages native HashSet and works in O( max(str.length, delimeter.length) ) complexity instead:An easy way to do this is to process each character of the string with each delimiter and build an array of the splits:Usage: splix(string, delimiters...)Example: splix("1.23--4", ".", "--")Returns: ["1", "23", "4"]I use regexp:
