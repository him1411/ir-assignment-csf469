I expectedYou\'ve got a workable idea, but the #flatten! is in the wrong place -- it flattens its receiver, so you could use it to turn [1, 2, [\'foo\', \'bar\']] into [1,2,\'foo\',\'bar\'].I\'m doubtless forgetting some approaches, but you can concatenate:or prepend/append:or splice:or append and flatten:You can just use the + operator!You can read all about the array class here:\nhttp://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.htmlThe cleanest approach is to use the Array#concat method; it will not create a new array (unlike Array#+ which will do the same thing but create a new array).Straight from the docs (http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-concat):Appends the elements of other_ary to self.SoArray#concat will not flatten a multidimensional array if it is passed in as an argument. You\'ll need to handle that separately:Lastly, you can use our corelib gem (https://github.com/corlewsolutions/corelib) which adds useful helpers to the Ruby core classes.  In particular we have an Array#add_all method which will automatically flatten multidimensional arrays before executing the concat.Here are two ways, notice in this case that the first way returns a new array ( translates to somearray = somearray + anotherarray )Try this, it will combine your arrays removing duplicateshttp://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.htmlFurther documentation look at "Set Union"Easy method that works with Ruby version >= 2.0 but not with older versions :(array1 + array2).uniqThis way you get array1 elements first. You will get no duplicates.["some", "thing"] + ["another" + "thing"]The question, essentially, is "how to concatenate arrays in Ruby". Naturally the answer is to use concat or + as mentioned in nearly every answer.A natural extension to the question would be "how to perform row-wise concatenation of 2D arrays in Ruby". When I googled "ruby concatenate matrices", this SO question was the top result so I thought I would leave my answer to that (unasked but related) question here for posterity.In some applications you might want to "concatenate" two 2D arrays row-wise. Something like,This is something like "augmenting" a matrix. For example, I used this technique to create a single adjacency matrix to represent a graph out of a bunch of smaller matrices. Without this technique I would have had to iterate over the components in a way that could have been error prone or frustrating to think about. I might have had to do an each_with_index, for example. Instead I combined zip and flatten as follows,If the new data could be an array or a scalar, and you want to prevent the new data to be nested if it was an array, the splat operator is awesome! It returns a scalar for a scalar, and an unpacked list of arguments for an array.I find it easier to push or append arrays and then flatten them in place, like so:I\'m surprised nobody has mentioned reduce, which works well when you have an array of arrays:Elaborating on @Pilcrow\'s answer the only suitable answer for huge arrays is concat since is fast and does not allocate a new object to be garbage-collected when operating inside a loop.Here\'s the benchmark:Results:As you can see using push throws an ERROR: stack level too deep (SystemStackError) when the arrays are big enough.
