I\'ve been searching on SO & Google for a breakdown of the various View Engines available for ASP.NET MVC, but haven\'t found much more than simple high-level descriptions of what a view engine is.I\'m not necessarily looking for "best" or "fastest" but rather some real world comparisons of advantages / disadvantages of the major players (e.g. the default WebFormViewEngine, MvcContrib View Engines, etc.) for various situations.  I think this would be really helpful in determining if switching from the default engine would be advantageous for a given project or development group.Has anyone encountered such a comparison?Since a comprehensive list does not appear to exist, let\'s start one here on SO. This can be of great value to the ASP.NET MVC community if people add their experience (esp. anyone who contributed to one of these).  Anything implementing IViewEngine (e.g. VirtualPathProviderViewEngine) is fair game here.  Just alphabetize new View Engines (leaving WebFormViewEngine and Razor at the top), and try to be objective in comparisons.System.Web.Mvc.WebFormViewEngineDesign Goals:A view engine that is used to render a\n  Web Forms page to the response.Pros:Cons:Example:System.Web.RazorDesign Goals:Pros:Cons:Con Example #1 (notice the placement of "string[]..."):BellevueDesign goals:BrailDesign Goals:The Brail view engine has been ported\n  from MonoRail to work with the\n  Microsoft ASP.NET MVC Framework. For\n  an introduction to Brail, see the\n  documentation on the Castle project\n  website.Pros:Cons:Example:HasicHasic uses VB.NET\'s XML literals instead of strings like most other view engines.Pros:Cons:Example:NDjangoDesign Goals:NDjango is an implementation of the\n  Django Template Language on the .NET\n  platform, using the F# language.Pros:NHamlDesign Goals:.NET port of Rails Haml view engine.\n  From the Haml website:Haml is a markup language that\'s used\n  to cleanly and simply describe the\n  XHTML of any web document, without the\n  use of inline code... Haml avoids the\n  need for explicitly coding XHTML into\n  the template, because it is actually\n  an abstract description of the XHTML,\n  with some code to generate dynamic\n  content.Pros:Cons:Example:NVelocityViewEngine (MvcContrib)Design Goals:A view engine based upon\n  NVelocity which is a .NET port\n  of the popular Java project\n  Velocity.Pros:Cons:Example:SharpTilesDesign Goals:SharpTiles is a partial port of JSTL\n  combined with concept behind the Tiles\n  framework (as of Mile stone 1).Pros:Cons:Example:Spark View EngineDesign Goals:The idea is to allow the html to\n  dominate the flow and the code to fit\n  seamlessly.Pros:Cons:Example:StringTemplate View Engine MVCDesign Goals:Pros:Cons:Wing BeatsWing Beats is an internal DSL for creating XHTML. It is based on F# and includes an ASP.NET MVC view engine, but can also be used solely for its capability of creating XHTML. Pros:Cons:XsltViewEngine (MvcContrib)Design Goals:Builds views from familiar XSLTPros:Cons:My current choice is Razor. It is very clean and easy to read and keeps the view pages very easy to maintain. There is also intellisense support which is really great. ALos, when used with web helpers it is really powerful too.To provide a simple sample:And there you have it. That is very clean and easy to read. Granted, that\'s a simple example but even on complex pages and forms it is still very easy to read and understand.As for the cons? Well so far (I\'m new to this) when using some of the helpers for forms there is a lack of support for adding a CSS class reference which is a little annoying.Thanks\nNathj07I know this doesn\'t really answer your question, but different View Engines have different purposes.  The Spark View Engine, for example, aims to rid your views of "tag soup" by trying to make everything fluent and readable.Your best bet would be to just look at some implementations.  If it looks appealing to the intent of your solution, try it out.  You can mix and match view engines in MVC, so it shouldn\'t be an issue if you decide to not go with a specific engine.Check this SharpDOM . This is a c# 4.0 internal dsl for generating html and also asp.net mvc view engine.I like ndjango. It is very easy to use and very flexible. You can easily extend view functionality with custom tags and filters. I think that "greatly tied to F#" is rather advantage than disadvantage.I think this list should also include samples of each view engine so users can get a flavour of each without having to visit every website. Pictures say a thousand words and markup samples are like screenshots for view engines :) So here\'s one from my favourite Spark View Engine
