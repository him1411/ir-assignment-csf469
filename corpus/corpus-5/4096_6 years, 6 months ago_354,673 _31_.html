I have a div with default positioning (i.e. position:static) and a div with a fixed position.If I set the z-indexes of the elements, it seems impossible to make the fixed element go behind the static element.Or on jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/mhFxf/I can work around this by using \nposition:absolute\non the static element, but can anyone tell me why this is happening?(There seems to be a similar question to this one, (Fixed Positioning breaking z-index) but it dosen\'t have a satisfactory answer, hence I am asking this here with my example code)This question can be solved in a number of ways, but really, knowing the stacking rules allows you to find the best answer that works for you.The <html> element is your only stacking context, so just follow the stacking rules inside a stacking context and you will see that elements are stacked in this orderSo you canDevelopers should know the following before trying to change the stacking order of elements.The Stacking order and stacking context rules below are from this linkThe order of elements:Add position: relative; to #overFiddlez-index only works within a particular context i.e. relative, fixed or absolute position.z-index for a relative div has nothing to do with the z-index of an absolutely or fixed div.EDIT This is an incomplete answer. This answer provides false information. Please review @Dansingerman\'s comment and example below.since your over div doesn\'t have a positioning, the z-index doesn\'t know where and how to position it (and with respect to what?). Just change your over div\'s position to relative, so there is no side effects on that div and then the under div will obey to your will.here is your example on jsfiddle: Fiddleedit: I see someone already mentioned this answer!Give the #under a negative z-index, e.g. -1This happens because the z-index property is ignored in position: static;, which happens to be the default value; so in the CSS code you wrote, z-index is 1 for both elements no matter how high you set it in #over.By giving #under a negative value, it will be behind  any z-index: 1; element, i.e. #over.When elements are positioned outside the normal flow, they can overlap other elements.according to Overlapping Elements section on http://web.archive.org/web/20130501103219/http://w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.aspJust look in MDN documentation. There is the best explanation I have ever seen.I was building a nav menu. I have overflow: hidden in my nav\'s css which hid everything. I thought it was a z-index problem, but really I was hiding everything outside my nav.the behaviour of fixed elements (and absolute elements) as defined in CSS Spec:They behave as they are detached from document, and placed in the nearest fixed/absolute positioned parent. (not a word by word quote)This makes zindex calculation a bit complicated, I solved my problem (the same situation) by dynamically creating a container in body element and moving all such elements (which are class-ed as "my-fixed-ones" inside that body-level element)
