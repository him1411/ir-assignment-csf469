I am working with the Exchange Web Services Managed API, with contact data. I have the following code, which is functional, but not ideal:As I said, this code works. Now I want to make it suck a little less, if possible.I can\'t find any methods that allow me to check for the existence of the key in the dictionary before attempting to access it, and if I try to read it (with .ToString()) and it doesn\'t exist then an exception is thrown:500\n  The given key was not present in the dictionary.How can I refactor this code to suck less (while still being functional)?You can use ContainsKey:or TryGetValue:Update: according to a comment the actual class here is not an IDictionary but a PhysicalAddressDictionary, so the methods are Contains and TryGetValue but they work in the same way.Example usage:Update 2: here is the working code (compiled by question asker)...with the inner conditional repeated as necessary for each key required. The TryGetValue is only done once per PhysicalAddressKey (Home, Work, etc).What is the type of c.PhysicalAddresses? If it\'s Dictionary<TKey,TValue>, then you can use the ContainsKey method.PhysicalAddressDictionary.TryGetValue
