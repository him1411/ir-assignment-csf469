I have a list:and want to search for items that contain the string \'abc\'. How can I do that?would check if \'abc\' exists in the list but it is a part of \'abc-123\' and \'abc-456\', \'abc\' does not exist on its own. So how can I get all items that contain \'abc\' ?If you only want to check for the presence of abc in any string in the list, you could tryIf you really want to get all the items containing abc, useUse filter to get at the elements that have abc.You can also use a list comprehension.By the way, don\'t use the word list as a variable name since it is already used for the list type.Just throwing this out there: if you happen to need to match against more than one string, for example abc and def, you can put combine two list comprehensions as follows:Output:This is quite an old question, but I offer this answer because the previous answers do not cope with items in the list that are not strings (or some kind of iterable object). Such items would cause the entire list comprehension to fail with an exception.To gracefully deal with such items in the list by skipping the non-iterable items, use the following:then, with such a list:you will still get the matching items ([\'abc-123\', \'abc-456\'])The test for iterable may not be the best. Got it from here: In Python, how do I determine if an object is iterable?This is the shortest way:From my knowledge, a \'for\' statement will always consume time.When the list length is growing up, the execution time will also grow.I think that, searching a substring in a string with \'is\' statement is a bit faster.But, I agree that the any statement is more readable.
