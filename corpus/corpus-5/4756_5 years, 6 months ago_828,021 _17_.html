I have come across this delightful:but sometimes it does not work with all my items, as if they weren\'t recognized in the list (when it\'s a list of string).is it the most \'pythonic\' way of finding an item in a list: if x in l:?As for your first question: that code is perfectly fine and should work if item equals one of the elements inside myList. Maybe you try to find a string that does not exactly match one of the items or maybe you are using a float value which suffers from inaccuracy.As for your second question: There\'s actually several possible ways if "finding" things in lists.This is the use case you describe: Checking whether something is inside a list or not. As you know, you can use the in operator for that:That is, finding all elements in a sequence that meet a certain condition. You can use list comprehension or generator expressions for that:The latter will return a generator which you can imagine as a sort of lazy list that will only be built as soon as you iterate through it. By the way, the first one is exactly equivalent toin Python 2. Here you can see higher-order functions at work. In Python 3, filter doesn\'t return a list, but a generator-like object.If you only want the first thing that matches a condition (but you don\'t know what it is yet), it\'s fine to use a for loop (possibly using the else clause as well, which is not really well-known). You can also usewhich will return the first match or raise a StopIteration if none is found. Alternatively, you can useFor lists, there\'s also the index method that can sometimes be useful if you want to know where a certain element is in the list:However, note that if you have duplicates, .index always returns the lowest index:If there are duplicates and you want all the indexes then you can use enumerate() instead:If you want to find one element or None use default in next, it won\'t raise StopIteration if the item was not found in the list:While the answer from Niklas B. is pretty comprehensive, when we want to find an item in a list it is sometimes useful to get its index:Check there are no additional/unwanted whites space in the items of the list of strings.\nThat\'s a reason that can be interfering explaining the items cannot be found.
