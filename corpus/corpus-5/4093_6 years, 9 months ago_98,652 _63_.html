I\'ve been using Git on both Windows and Ubuntu during the development of a small project, frequently flipping back and forth between the two.  The issue I\'m having is that Git/Bash consistently become slow.  When I say slow, I mean that running cd takes anywhere from 8-25 seconds, running git commands take from 5-20 seconds, and ls can take up to 30 seconds sometimes.  Needless to say, this is not fun, not to mention unproductive.  I know Git is slower on Windows, but this is ridiculous.The one solution which has worked--temporarily--for me has been to disable my network connection (as suggested in this answer), start git, and then reconnect.  Sometimes it continues to run quickly for days after doing that, but the performance always degrades eventually.  I\'ve trawled through the msysgit discussion group, SO, msysgit issue list, etc. on and off for weeks, but I haven\'t been able to turn up solutions which work.So far, I\'ve tried:I did read that a couple people had success disabling bash completion, but ideally I\'d like to keep that active.  The version of msysgit is 1.7.3.1-preview20101002 & the OS is Windows 7 x64.  Running the same things on Linux is, predictably, lightning fast.  I would use Linux exclusively, but I need to run stuff in Windows, too (certain apps, testing, etc.).Has anyone encountered a similar issue?  If so, what was the underlying problem and what was the solution (if any)?Edit: This extends beyond just the git repositories, but just for reference, the repos I\'ve been using git with have been pretty small: ~4-50 files max.You can significantly speed up git on Windows by running three commands to set some config options:Notes:core.preloadindex does filesystem operations in parallel to hide latency (update: enabled by default in git 2.1)core.fscache fixes UAC issues so you don\'t need to run git as admin (update: enabled by default in Git for Windows 2.8)gc.auto minimizes the number of files in .git/Do you have Git information showing in your Bash prompt?  If so, maybe you\'re inadvertently doing way too much work on every command.  To test this theory try the following temporary change in Bash:My Windows home directory is on the network, and I suspected that Git Bash commands were looking there first.  Sure enough, when I looked at $PATH, it listed /h/bin first, where /h is a share on a Windows file server, even though /h/bin doesn\'t exist.  I edited /etc/profile and commented out the export command that puts it first in $PATH:This made my commands run much faster, probably because Git Bash is no longer looking across the network for the executables.  My /etc/profile was c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\etc\\profile.While your problem might be network based, I\'ve personally sped up my local git status calls tenfold (7+ seconds down to 700ms) by doing two modifications.  This is on a 700mb repo with 21,000 files and excessive numbers of large binary files.One is enabling parallel index preloads.  From a command prompt:\ngit config core.preloadindex true\nThis changed time git status from 7 seconds to 2.5 seconds.  Update!The following is no longer necessary.  A patch has fixed this as of mysysgit 1.9.4\n  https://github.com/msysgit/git/commit/64d63240762df22e92b287b145d75a0d68a66988\n  However, you must enable the fix by typing\n  git config core.fscache trueI also disabled the UAC and the "luafv" driver (reboot required).  This disables a driver in windows vista, 7 and 8 that redirects programs trying to write to system locations and instead redirects those accesses to a user directory.To see a discussion on how this effects git performance, read here:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/msysgit/issues/detail?id=320To disable this driver, in regedit, change the "start" key at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/luafv to 4 to disable the driver.  Then, put UAC to its lowest setting, "never notify".If the disabling of this driver makes you wary (it should), an alternative is running on a drive (or partition) different than your system partition.  Apparently the driver only runs on file access on the system partition.  I have a second hard drive and see identical results when run with this registry modification on my C drive as I do without it on the D drive.This change takes time git status from 2.5 seconds down to 0.7 seconds.You also might want to follow https://github.com/msysgit/git/pull/94 and https://github.com/git/git/commit/d637d1b9a8fb765a8542e69bd2e04b3e229f663b to check out what additional work is underway for speed issues in Windows.In an extension to Chris Dolan\'s answer, I used the following alternative PS1 setting. Simply add the code fragment to your ~/.profile (on Win7: c:/Users/USERNAME/.profile).This retains the benefit of a colored shell and display of the current branch name (if in a git repo), but is significantly faster on my machine, from ~0.75s to 0.1s. Based on this blog.I found the network drive was the performance problem. HOME was pointing to a slow network share.\nI could not override HOMEDRIVE but that is not a problem from what I have seen.Set the environment variable by right clicking \nyour computer on the desktop --> properties --> Advanced system settings --> Environment Variables\nAdd to User variables sectionIt appears that completely uninstalling Git, restarting (the classic Windows cure), and reinstalling Git was the cure.  I also wiped out all bash config files which were left over (they were manually created).  Everything is fast again.If for some reason reinstalling isn\'t possible (or desirable), then I would definitely try changing the PS1 variable referenced in Chris Dolan\'s answer; it resulted in significant speedups in certain operations.I saw a decent improvement by setting core.preloadindex to true as recommended here.I solved my slow git problem on Win 7 x64 by starting cmd.exe with "Run as administrator".  I know this is old, but I was having the same problem, in both Git Bash and Git Gui. Both programs use to run nicely, but then they randomly slowed down to a crawl, and I couldn\'t figure out why. As it turns out, it was Avast. Avast has caused odd things to happen to various programs (including programs I write), so I disabled it for a second, and sure enough, Bash now runs as fast as it does on Linux. I just added the Git program files folder (C:\\Program Files\\Git) to the Avast exclusion list, and now it runs as fast as it does on Linux.And yes, I realize the Anti-Virus was not the issue in the original post, but I\'ll just put this here in case it\'s useful to someone.As noted in Chris Dolan\'s and Wilbert\'s answers, PS1 slows you down.Rather than completely disabling (as suggested by Dolan) or using the script offered by Wilbert, I use a "dumb PS1" that is much faster.It uses (git symbolic-ref -q HEAD || git rev-parse --short HEAD) 2> /dev/null:On my cygwin, this is faster than Wilbert\'s "fast_git_ps1" answer - 200ms vs. 400ms, so it shaves off a bit of your prompt sluggishness.It isn\'t as sophisticated as __git_ps1 - for example it doesn\'t change the prompt when you cd into the .git directory, etc. but for normal everyday use it\'s good enough and fast.Tested on git 1.7.9 (cygwin, but should work on any platform)I\'ve encountered the same problem running git for Windows (msysgit) on Windows 7 x64 as a limited user account for quite some time. From what I\'ve read here and other places, the common theme seems to be the lack of administrative privileges and/or UAC. Since UAC is off on my system, the explanation that it is trying to write/delete something in the program files directory makes the most sense to me.In any case, I\'ve resolved my problem by installing the portable version of git 1.8 with zipinstaller. Note that I had to unpack the .7z distribution file and repack it as a zip in order for zipinstaller to work. I also had to manually add that directory to my system path.The performance is fine now. Even though it is installed in the Program Files (x86) directory, which I don\'t have permissions for as a limited user, it doesn\'t seem to suffer from the same problem. I ascribe this either to the fact that the portable version is a bit more conservative in where it writes/deletes files, which is probably the case, or to the upgrade from 1.7 to 1.8. I\'m not going to try to pin down which one is the reason, suffice to say it works much better now, including bash.You might also gain a very subsquent performance boost by changing the following git configuration : When running the simple git status command on Window 7 x64, it took my computer more than 30 seconds to run. After this option was defined, command is immediate.Activating Git\'s own tracing as explained in the following page helped me found the origin of the problem, which might differ in your installation : \nhttps://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/wiki/Diagnosing-why-Git-is-so-slow Combined answers:Result:If you use Git from cmd, try running it from Git Bash.\nIn cmd, git.exe is actually a wrapper that sets up the correct environment every time you start it, and only then launches the real git.exe. I can take up to twice as much time as it\'s required to just do what you want. And Git Bash sets up the environment only when it starts.In my case, it actually was Avast antivirus leading to git bash and even Powershell becoming really slow.I first tried disabling Avast for 10 minutes to see if it improved the speed and it did. Afterwards, I added the entire Git Bash installation directory as an exception in Avast, for Read, Write and Execute. In my case that was C:\\Program Files\\Git\\*.I also had issue with git PS1 slowness, altough for a long time I was thinking it\'s a db size problem (big repo), and was trying various git gc triks, and were looking for other reasons, just like you. However, in my case, the problem was this line:So what was slow was doing the git status for every command line status line. Ouch. It was something I wrote by hand. I saw that was problem when I tried thelike mentioned in one answer here. Command line was lightning fast.Now I\'m using this:From this SO https://stackoverflow.com/a/11975827/2492808  and it works fine. Again have fast git command line.In my case, the git bash shortcut was set to Start in:%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% (you can check this by right clicking git bash and selecting properties). This was the network drive. The solution is to make it point to %HOME%. If you do not have it, you can set it up in the environment variables and now git bash should be lightning fast.I\'m really late to the party, I know......but: a co-worker of mine had troubles with git on windows (7) git status checkout and add were fast, but git commit took ages.We are still trying to find the root cause of this, but cloning the repo into a new folder fixed his problem. Thought I\'d add it here, in case someone else has the same problem and is still looking for a solution.
