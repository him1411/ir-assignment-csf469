I have a procedure in SQL that I am trying to turn into Linq:The line I am most concerned with is:I have a column that stores the hierarchy like /1/3/12/ for example so I just use %/12/% to search for it.My question is, what is the Linq or .NET equivalent to using the percent sign?You can also use .StartsWith() or .EndsWith().Use this:I\'m assuming you\'re using Linq-to-SQL* (see note below). If so, use string.Contains, string.StartsWith, and string.EndsWith to generate SQL that use the SQL LIKE operator.orNote:  * = if you are using the ADO.Net Entity Framework (EF / L2E) in .net 3.5, be aware that it will not do the same translation as Linq-to-SQL. Although L2S does a proper translation, L2E v1 (3.5) will translate into a t-sql expression that will force a full table scan on the table you\'re querying unless there is another better discriminator in your where clause or join filters.\nUpdate: This is fixed in EF/L2E v4 (.net 4.0), so it will generate a SQL LIKE just like L2S does.If you are using VB.NET, then the answer would be "*". Here is what your where clause would look like...Note: "*" Matches zero or more characters. Here is the msdn article for the Like operator.In case you happened to need it in LINQ to Entities, here is how: http://jendaperl.blogspot.com/2011/02/like-in-linq-to-entities.htmlWell indexOf works for me tooUse such codeUsing predicate builder to make Linq queries is a good practice when building dynamic queries with many such conditions. See this codeproject article alsoTry this, this works fine for me In case you are not matching numeric strings, always good to have common case:I do always this:I know I don\'t use the like statement but it\'s work fine in the background is this translated into a query with a like statement.Contains is used in Linq ,Just like Like is used in SQL .. . .You can write your SQL script in Linq as Following :
