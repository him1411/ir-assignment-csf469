After installing Xcode 6 my devices moved to greyed-out section Ineligible Devices and I can\'t select them as deploy target:Update:This error occurs in all versions of Xcode 6.x.x.\nThere are so many different reasons causing this problemCheck this solution list  for more details.With the release of Xcode 6.3.1, check first the Update 5 You find this option in "Build Settings" tab when you click on a target of your project in Xcode.Then if does not work, try to restart Xcode. Sometimes we have to restart the Mac and iPhone/iPad. Take a look at the Updates below before restarting Xcode Update: in Yosemite, Xcode 6.0.1 does not support iOS 8.1, you have to update to Xcode 6.1 if you want to debug on iOS 8.1 device, or you will probably have the same problem as described in the topicUpdate 2: Xcode Beta 6.3 does not support iOS 8.2 (and also 8.1 - thanks @steveb). You won\'t see your device in deploy target list. I don\'t know if other versions are supported.Update 3. Use Xcode 6.2 instead of Xcode 6.3 beta in order to debug with a device running iOS 8.2Updated 4 : for Xcode 6.3 (and eventually 6.3 beta if someone use it :) ), if you have this problem, just go to Product > Destination to select your device. Even though it says your device is ineligible, it will still allow you to select it. If your device version is >= target version, the build should work. It must be a bug for Xcode 6.3 in debug with iOS 8.3 (or maybe other iOS version) (thanks @einfach).From Release Notes (Xcode 6.3.1):Fixed: Devices previously listed as "ineligible for running\xe2\x80\x9d\n  erroneously are listed correctly. (20121178)There is a lot of options (10 23 29 answers for this question!), that can cause this error. And no one is 100% solve this issue. Here is summarise of all solutions.0. Update to latest Xcode version\nMost of the reasons, that cause this problem fixed in Xcode version 6.3.1 (6D1002 published April 21, 2015)The most likely solution::iOS Deployment Target should be <= of the version of your device. \nYou find this option in Build Settings tab when you click on a target of your project in Xcode.If version is correct - try to restart Mac and iPhone/iPad simultaneously. It resolve this issue in most cases! (thanks, @HoaParis)Finally if either doesn\'t work - try to do this magic actions:Xcode Beta 6.3 does not support iOS 8.2 (and also 8.1). You won\'t see your iDevice in deploy target list. \nUse Xcode 6.2 instead of Xcode 6.3 beta in order to debug with an iDevice iOS 8.2Xcode 6.3 requires Unity 4.6.4\nIf you\'re using an older Unity version (e.g. 4.6.3) you\'ll always get your devices in the Ineligible Devices section (thanks, @d4rk)Also it appears in case of changing name of Xcode project. The fix it -  create a new scheme by selecting Manage Schemes > (+) button. (thanks, @dale-moore)Beta to Release upgrade of Xcode can require upgrading iOS or watchOS from beta to release version. For example, when switching from Xcode 8 beta 6 to Xcode 8 release, watchOS 3 beta is listed as unsupported.Everyone should note that there seems to be a bug in XCode 6.3 (Beta and GM) that is aggravating this problem.I have iOS 8.3 installed on my device.  Setting the build target to iOS <= 8.3 did not help.  Nor did any of the other solutions posted.What worked for me:Go to the Product Menu > Destination and select your device.  It will be listed under "Ineligible", but you will still be able to select it.  After doing this, I was able to build and deploy to my device.I had a similar issue and for me I had upgraded to iOS8 and also changed the name of my Xcode project.  The fix for me was to create a new scheme by selecting Manage Schemes > (+) button.After doing this, my list of devices returned.What worked for me is to install XCode 6.1 (compatible with iOS 8.1)Besides setting iOS Deployment Target to iOS 8.0, also restart your iOS8 iPhone/iPad. This did the trick for me. You can try below solutions to run build in your device.Restart your iOS device (If device is recently updated) and your Xcode.Make Sure that in build settings "iOS Deployment Target" is <= the version of your iDevice.\nOtherwise you can goto - Product > Destination, select your device which would be showing as ineligible device.You will be able to select your device and run your build.I also came across that if you have the iOS 8.4 then your Xcode doesn\'t have the SDK for iOS 8.4 due to which devices show as ineligible. To solve this issueDownload Xcode 6.4My iPhone has updated to iOS8.1. My Xcode version is 6.0.1, and my mac os version is 10.10. When I want to run app in my iPhone, there is a section named Ineligible Devices(OS Version). Then I update Xcode to 6.1 version, solved problem. Part of Xcode 6.1 release note: Includes SDKS for OS X 10.10 Yosemite, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and iOS 8.1.That is, Xcode 6.0.x don\'t support iOS 8.1.My solution was that I had recently upgraded my iOS device to 8.3 and Xcode still didn\'t recognize it. The fix was to simply upgrade Xcode to 6.3 :)After trying the 2 answers above (changing deployment target and restarting my iOS device), what finally fixed it for me was restarting my Mac.For iOS 9.1+ devices, the Xcode version should be upgraded to 7.1 (even 7.0x will not work)I simply restarted my Mac and my iPhone 6 and the problem was solved. I never had to change my deployment target.Changing your deployment target is not a good idea to solve this problem (it will change which iOS versions you support on the app store).What I did is restart just Xcode and it was fixed.I agree with txulu, changing the deployment target is a ridiculous idea. I need to support devices back at least one version, that is non-negotiable to me.Restarting my iPhone 5 after updating to iOS 8.1 and Xcode to 6.1 worked for me.Simply  deploying to another device and then switching back to the former \'ineligible\' device worked here.\n(saved the hassle of restarting anything)In my case I had to reattach device and when it asks press "Trust this computer", then my device appears available again in xCodemake sure the deployment target version in setting is lower or equal than the iphone version if the deployment target is 7.1  but the iphone is 7.0.3you will see that error message Ran into the same issue, using Unity3D=> Xcode 6.3 requires Unity 4.6.4If you\'re using an older Unity version (e.g. 4.6.3) you\'ll always get your devices in the Ineligible Devices sectionUpgrade XCode to ensure that it supports your current iOS version on device. (In my case, my phone was on iOS 9.1.x) `but XCode version was 7, which supported iOS 9.0 devices)I changed my deployment target to 7.1 the same as my iphone, and now I can run swift programs on it. It was on 8.0 and showed up as ineligible.I set my "iOS Deployment Target" in "Project" and "Targets" from 7.1 to 8.0 and restarted Xcode (with "Quit") and it worked.I can confirm that the answer it to upgrade Xcode to 6.1. If you are using Xcode 6.0.x you will not be able to select a device running 8.1. Your deployment targets and OS version should have nothing to do with this.If your OS version is greater than 10.9.4 I would recommend this. First, un-attaching all devices. Download Xcode 6.1. After opening the new version of Xcode attach your device. You should be good to go.Another good thing would be to look at the release notes. It\'s and easy read and gives you a general idea of what still needs to be fixed.My iPad was 8.0, but i had deployment target set to 8.1. I changed the deployment target in build settings, and immediately, the ipad moved out of the "ineligible" category. (I am on Yosemite and XCode 6.1)I\'m using the 6.3 Xcode Beta. I had the same issue as above. I restarted my computer and phone but did not work. Simply went to the build target under build settings and changed build target to 8.1. I hope this is fixed in the next released. Make sure that after you change your build setting - you need to restart your device and Xcode! Please check you device iOS version and your Xcode application build target version. This might be causing the issue.My answer, perhaps listed already but i did not notice, was simple: I deleted the app in question from the target itself, then fired up Xcode and the target was then available. And yes, i tried most of the other suggestions, and was resorting to activating the target from the Product menu, but that was getting tedious.If you have a chance to run any project on the \'ineligible\' device from other Mac with Xcode, try it and then reconnect the device to your Mac (without restarting Xcode/Mac).\nFor me, after doing that, the \'ineligible device\' section disappears and my device returns to the normal status.\nHope it helps for someone.Fixed in Xcode version 6.3.1 (6D1002) published April 21, 2015.At least the problem magically went away for me after installing this Xcode version.Tried all possible Updates, with Xcode 6.3, iOS 8.3 and OSX 10.10.3, but didn\'t got a permanent solution.Kudos to skywinder,the first option worked!For most people the cause of the problem is probably mismatch between Xcode, device version and app target version.\nIf versions are not a problem for you, most likely is that the device (iPhone/iPad) has been used with another Mac to copy apps to. This happens particularly more with a team environment where an iDevice can be used between team members. Xcode knows some other developer\'s Mac has connected to this device, it will show up as "Ineligible". But the previous Mac that connected to it, it will show up as normal.\nThe quickest work around is as shown by joshstaiger among others:\nGo to Xcode ->Product->Destination\nSelect the ineligible device as target. It should work.
