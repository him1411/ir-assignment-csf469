How can I convert a string to date in js?The best string format for string parsing is the date ISO format together with the JavaScript Date object constructor. Examples of ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.But wait!  Just using the "ISO format" doesn\'t work reliably by itself. String are sometimes parsed as UTC and sometimes as localtime (based on browser vendor and version). The best practice should always be to store dates as UTC and make computations as UTC.To parse a date as UTC, append a Z - e.g.: new Date(\'2011-04-11T10:20:30Z\').To display a date in UTC, use .toUTCString(),\nto display a date in user\'s local time, use .toString().More info on MDN | Date and this answer.For old Internet Explorer compatibility (IE versions less than 9 do not support ISO format in Date constructor), you should split datetime string representation to it\'s parts and then you can use constructor using datetime parts, e.g.:  new Date(\'2011\', \'04\' - 1, \'11\', \'11\', \'51\', \'00\'). Note that the number of the month must be 1 less.Alternate method - use an appropriate library:You can also take advantage of the library Moment.js that allows parsing date with the specified time zone.Unfortunately I found out that returns "Wed Apr 02 2014". I know it\'s sounds crazy, but it happens for some users.\nThe bulletproof solution is the followingAnd the output will be:new Date(2000, 10, 1) will give you "Wed Nov 01 2000 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (CET)" See that 0 for month gives you JanuaryPass it as an argument to Date():You can access the date, month, year using, for example: dt.getMonth().If you can use the terrific moment library (e.g. in an Node.js project) you can easily parse your date using e.g.and can access the JS date object viaIf you want to convert from the format "dd/MM/yyyy". Here is an example:This solution works in IE versions less than 9.moment.js (http://momentjs.com/) is a complete and good package for use dates and supports ISO 8601 strings.You could add string date and format.And you could check if date is valid.See documentation\nhttp://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/Recommendation: I recommend use a package for dates that contains a lot of formats, because the timezone and format time management is really a big problem, moment js solve a lot of formats. You could parse easily a date from a simple string to date but I think that is a hard work to support all formats and variations of dates.Date.parse almost gets you what you want.  It chokes on the am/pm part, but with some hacking you can get it to work:check out datejs library http://www.datejs.com/For those who are looking for a tiny and smart solution:Example:I have created a fiddle for this, you can use toDate() function on any date string and provide the date format. This will return you a Date object.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/Sushil231088/q56yd0rp/Just new Date(st);Assuming that it\'s the proper format.For \xd1\x81onverting string to date in js i use http://momentjs.com/Convert to format pt-BR:I hope help somebody!!!or date string in format \'01-01-1970\' will not work in FireFox, So better use "/" instead of "-" in date format string.If you need to check the contents of the string before converting to Date format:use this  code : (my propblem was solved with this code) }ISO 8601-esque datestrings, as excellent as the standard is, are still not widely supported. This is a great resource to figure out which datestring format you should use: http://dygraphs.com/date-formats.htmlYes, that means that your datestring could be as simple as  as opposed to "2014/10/13 23:57:52"\ninstead of\n"2014-10-13 23:57:52"In angularjs use $filter service to change date into your needed format like given belowYet another way to do it:I made this function to convert any Date object to a UTC Date object.use this format....You can also do:\nmydate.toLocaleDateString();
