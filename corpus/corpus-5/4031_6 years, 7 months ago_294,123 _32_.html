With maven, I occasionally hit an artifact that comes from some 3rd-party repo that I haven\'t built or included in my repository yet. I\'ll get an error message from the maven client saying that an artifact can\'t be found:Failure to find org.jfrog.maven.annomojo:maven-plugin-anno:jar:1.4.0\n  in http://myrepo:80/artifactory/repo was cached in the local\n  repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update\n  interval of MyRepo has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1]Now, I understand what this means, and can simply re-run my command with -U, and things usually work fine from there on out.  However, I find this error message to be extremely unintuitive and am trying to spare my co-workers some headaches.  I am trying to figure out if there is some place that I can modify this update interval setting.  I used to solve this issue by deleting the corresponding failed to download artifact directory in my local repo. Next time I run the maven command the artifact download is triggered again. Therefore I\'d say it\'s a client side setting.Nexus side (server repo side), this issue is solved configuring a scheduled task. \nClient side, this is done using -U, as you already pointed out.you can delete the corresponding failed artifact directory in you local repository. And also you can simply use the -U in the goal. It will do the work. This works with maven 3. So no need to downgrade to maven 2.I had a related problem, but Raghuram\'s answer helped. (I don\'t have enough reputation yet to vote his answer up).  I\'m using Maven bundled with NetBeans, and was getting the same "...was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of nexus has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1]" error.  To fix this I added <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy> to my settings file (C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans 7.0\\java\\maven\\conf\\settings.xml)According to the settings reference:updatePolicy: This element specifies how often updates should attempt to occur. Maven will compare the local POM\xe2\x80\x99s timestamp (stored\n  in a repository\xe2\x80\x99s maven-metadata file) to the remote. The choices are:\n  always, daily (default), interval:X (where X is an integer in minutes)\n  or never.Example:  If you are using Eclipse then go to Windows -> Preferences -> Maven and uncheck the "Do not automatically update dependencies from remote repositories" checkbox. This works with Maven 3 as well.This error can sometimes be misleading. 2 things you might want to check:Is there an actual JAR for the dependency in the repo? Your error message contains a URL of where it is searching, so go there, and then browse to the folder that matches your dependency. Is there a jar? If not, you need to change your dependency. (for example, you could be pointing at a top level parent dependency, when you should be pointing at a sub project)If the jar exists on the remote repo, then just delete your local copy. It will be in your home directory (unless you configured differently) under .m2/repository (ls -a to show hidden if on Linux).How I got this problem,When I changed from Eclipse Juno to Luna, and checkout my maven projects from SVN repo, I got the same issues while building the applications. What I tried?\n I tried clean Local repository and then updating all the versions again using -U option. But my problem continued. Then I went to Window --> Preferences -> Maven --> User Settings --> and clicked on Reindex button under Local Repository and wait for the reindex to happen.That\'s all, the issue is resolved.You need to delete all "_maven.repositories" files from your repository.Somewhat relevent.. I was getting "[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project testproject: Could not resolve dependencies for project myjarname:jar:1.0-0: Failure to find myjarname-core:bundle:1.0-0 in http://repo1.maven.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1]"This error was caused by accidentally using Maven 3 instead of Maven 2.  Just figured it might save someone some time, because my initial google search led me to this page.If you use Nexus as a proxy repo, it has "Not Found Cache TTL" setting with default value 1440 minutes (or 24 hours). Lowering this value may help (Repositories > Configuration > Expiration Settings).See documentation for more info.In Eclipse:this problem confused me for one day. I solved it by checking my local repository location. I used IntelliJ as my IDE and I found the default local repository of maven is "C:/Users/.m2/repository". I changed it to my custom path and the problem was solved.
