In my repository, I have created tags using the following commands. How do you list all the tags in the repository?should be enough.  See git tag man page You also have:List tags with names that match the given pattern (or all if no pattern is given).\n  Typing "git tag" without arguments, also lists all tags.More recently ("How to sort git tags?", for Git 2.0+)Sort in a specific order.Supported type is:Prepend "-" to reverse sort order.That lists both:Note: the git ready article on tagging disapproves of lightweight tag.Without arguments, git tag creates a \xe2\x80\x9clightweight\xe2\x80\x9d tag that is basically a branch that never moves.\n  Lightweight tags are still useful though, perhaps for marking a known good (or bad) version, or a bunch of commits you may need to use in the future.\n  Nevertheless, you probably don\xe2\x80\x99t want to push these kinds of tags.Normally, you want to at least pass the -a option to create an unsigned tag, or sign the tag with your GPG key via the -s or -u  options.That being said, Charles Bailey points out that a \'git tag -m "..."\' actually implies a proper (unsigned annotated) tag (option \'-a\'), and not a lightweight one. So you are good with your initial command.This differs from:Which lists tags with their commits (see "Git Tag list, display commit sha1 hashes").\nNote the -d in order to dereference the annotated tag object (which have their own commit SHA1) and display the actual tagged commit.Similarly, git show --name-only <aTag> would list the tag and associated commit.To list tags I prefer:The -n flag displays the first line of the annotation message along with the tag, or the first commit message line if the tag is not annotated.You can also do git tag -n5 to show the first 5 lines of the annotation.Also git show-ref is rather useful, so that you can directly associate tags with correspondent commits:Try to make git tag it should be enough if not try to make git fetch then git tag.To see details about the latest available tag I sometimes use:If you want to check you tag name locally, you have to go to the path where you have created tag(local path). \nMeans where you have put your objects. \nThen type command:It will show all the objects under that tag name. \nI am working in Teradata and object means view, table etc
