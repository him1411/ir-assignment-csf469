How do I grep tab (\\t) in files on the Unix platform?If using GNU grep, you can use the Perl-style regexp:The trick is to use $ sign before single quotes. It also works for cut and other tools.I never managed to make the \'\\t\' metacharacter work with grep.\nHowever I found two alternate solutions:From this answer on Ask Ubuntu:Tell grep to use the regular expressions as defined by Perl (Perl has\n  \\t as tab):Use the literal tab character:Use printf to print a tab character for you:One way is (this is with Bash)-P turns on Perl regular expressions so \\t will work.As user unwind says, it may be specific to GNU grep. The alternative is to literally insert a tab in there if the shell, editor or terminal will allow it.This is not exactly what you are looking for, but might work in your caseEquivalent toSo it will find Space and Tab.ยง Character classesNote, it is not advertised in my man grep, but still worksUse echo to insert the tab for you grep "$(echo -e \\\\t)"grep "$(printf \'\\t\')" worked for me on Mac OS XA good choice is to use \'sed as grep\' (as explained in this classical sed tutorial).Examples (works in bash, sh, ksh, csh,..):+1 way, that works in ksh, dash, etc: use printf to insert TAB:use gawk, set the field delimiter to tab (\\t) and check for number of fields. If more than 1, then there is/are tabsThe answer is simpler. Write your grep and within the quote type the tab key, it works well at least in kshOn ksh I used Using the \'sed-as-grep\' method, but replacing the tabs with a visible character of personal preference is my favourite method, as it clearly shows both which files contain the requested info, and also where it is placed within lines:If you wish to make use of line/file info, or other grep options, but also want to see the visible replacement for the tab character, you can achieve this byAs an example:EDIT: Obviously the above is only useful for viewing file contents to locate tabs --- if the objective is to handle tabs as part of a larger scripting session, this doesn\'t serve any useful purpose.This works well for AIX. I am searching for lines containing JOINED<\\t>ACTIVEYou might want to use grep "$(echo -e \'\\t\')"Only requirement is echo to be capable of interpretation of backslash escapes.These alternative binary identification methods are totally functional. And, I really like the one\'s using awk, as I couldn\'t quite remember the syntaxic use with single binary chars. However, it should also be possible to assign a shell variable a value in a POSIX portable fashion (i.e. TAB=echo "@" | tr "\\100" "\\011"), and then employ it from there everywhere, in a POSIX portable fashion; as well (i.e grep "$TAB" filename). While this solution works well with TAB, it will also work well other binary chars, when another desired binary value is used in the assignment (instead of the value for the TAB character to \'tr\').The $\'\\t\' notation given in other answers is shell-specific -- it seems to work in bash and zsh but is not universal.NOTE: The following is for the fish shell and does not work in bash:In the fish shell, one can use an unquoted \\t, for example:Or one can use the hex or unicode notations e.g.:(these notations are useful for more esoteric characters)Since these values must be unquoted, one can combine quoted and unquoted values by concatenation:You can type to search for the tab character in the file foo.  You can probably also do other escape codes, though I\'ve only tested \\n.  Although it\'s rather time-consuming, and unclear why you would want to, in zsh you can also type the tab character, back to the begin, grep and enclose the tab with quotes.Look for blank spaces many times [[:space:]]* grep [[:space:]]*\'.\'\'.\'Will find something like this:\'the tab\' ..These are single quotations (\'), and not double ("). This is how you make concatenation in grep. =-)
