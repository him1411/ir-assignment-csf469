I downloaded bootstrap 3.0 and can\'t get the glyphicons to work. I get some kind of "E003" error. Any ideas why this is happening? I tried both locally and online and I still get the same problem.I was having the same issue and couldn\'t find any information about it except in the hidden comments on this page.  My font files were loading just fine according to Chrome, but the icons weren\'t displaying properly.  I\'m making this an answer so it will hopefully help others.Something was wrong with the font files that I downloaded from Bootstrap 3\'s customizer tool.  To get the correct fonts, go to the Bootstrap homepage and download the full .zip file.  Extract the four font files from there to your fonts directory and everything should work.Note to readers: be sure to read @user2261073\'s comment and @Jeff\'s answer concerning a bug in the customizer. It\'s likely the cause of your problem.The font file isn\'t being loaded correctly. Check if the files are in their expected location.As indicated by Daniel, it might also be a mimetype issue. Chrome\'s dev tools show downloaded fonts in the network tab:In my case I was getting a 404 for glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff, and non visible glyphicons on mobile browsers.Looks like there is some confusion about the MIME type for woff, more than one MIME type being accepted by different browsers, but the W3C says:Edit: After testing the following MIME type for woff works on all browsers currently:Edit: Latest version of Bootstrap at this time (3.3.5) uses .woff2 fonts with the same initial result as .woff, the W3C still defining the spec but at the moment the MIME type seems to be:-If you followed the highest rated answer and it\'s still not working: The Font folder MUST be on the same level as your CSS folder.  Fixing the path in bootstrap.css will not work.  Bootstrap.css has to navigate to the Fonts folder exactly like this: If the other solutions aren\'t working, you may want to try importing Glyphicons from an external source, rather than relying on Bootstrap to do everything for you. To do this:You can either do this in HTML:Or CSS:Credit to edsiofi from this thread: Bootstrap 3 Glyphicons CDNI was looking through this old question of mine and since what was supposed to be the correct answer up until now, was given by me in the comments, I think I also deserve the credit for it.The problem lied in the fact that the glyphicon font files downloaded from bootstrap\'s customizer tool were not the same with the ones that are downloaded from the redirection found at bootstrap\'s homepage. The ones that are working as they should are the ones that can be downloaded from the following link:Anyone having problems with old bad customizer files should overwrite the fonts from the link above.Azure Websites are missing woff MIME configuration. You must add following entry into web.configAs @Stijn described, the default location in Bootstrap.css is incorrect when installing this package from Nuget.Change this section to look like this:IIS will not server .woff files by default, so in IIS you\'ll need to add a <mimeMap> entry to your web.config file;I modified my less variables.less file \nI modified the variablethe original was It was causing a problem    This is due to wrong coding in bootstrap.css and bootstrap.min.css. When you download Bootstrap 3.0 from the Customizer the following code is missing:Since this is the main code for using Glyphicons, it won\'t work ofc...Download the css-files from the full package and this code will be implemented.Do you have all below files in your fonts directory Another problem/solution may be having this Bootstrap 2.x code:and when migrating based on the guide (.icon-*   ---> .glyphicon .glyphicon-*):you forget to add the icon class (containing the font reference):Below is what fixed it for me. I was getting "bad URI" error using in Firebug console. The icons were showing up as E### numbers. I had to add a .htaccess file in my \'fonts\' directory.\n\n<FilesMatch "\\.(ttf|otf|eot|woff)$">\n  <IfModule mod_headers.c>\n    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"\n  </IfModule>\n</FilesMatch>\n\nPossible duplicate of: Downloadable font on firefox: bad URI or cross-site access not allowedThis was the reason, why the icons didn\'t show up for me:After i have removed this part of my CSS, everything worked like it should. The !important was the one causing trouble.This is very much a long shoot, but it was my case and since it is not here already.If you are compiling Twitter Bootstrap from SASS using gulp-sass or grunt-sass ie. node-sass. Make sure your node modules are up to date, especially if your are working on a rather old project. It turns out that as of some time back the SASS directive @at-root is used in the definition of the @font-face in glyphicons, see https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/b01ab4942233bd7316a0634472e1243b13fb9f46/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_glyphicons.scss.The gotcha here is that node-sass ie. libsass do not support the @at-root directive if it is too old. If this is the case you will get a @font-face wrapped in a @at-root which the browser have no idea what to do with. The result of this is that no font will be downloaded and you will likely see garbage instead of icons.Here is what official documentation says regarding fonts not rendering.Other than that it could be that you missed to copy the fonts folder to the root directoryI got Bootstrap from NuGet. When I published my site the glyphs didn\'t work.In my case I got it working by setting the Build Action for each of the font files to \'Content\' and set them to \'Copy Always\'. Make sure you aren\'t over specifying the font family, for examplewill remove the halflings font from i elements. Note: below is likely a niche scenario, but I wanted to share it in case someone else might find it useful.  In a rails project, we are reusing quite a bit through a gem that is a Rails engine using bootstrap-sass.  All was well in the main project with the exception of the glyphicon font path resolution. We found that $bootstrap-sass-asset-helper was false during the resolution when we expected it to be true, so the path was different.We caused the $bootstrap-sass-asset-helper to be initialized in the engine gem by doing:e.g. this caused the path to resolve to:Again, this shouldn\'t be necessary in any normal rails project using bootstrap-sass, we just happen to be reusing a lot of views and this worked out for us.  Hopefully this can assist someone else.I was having the same problem where the browser was unable to find the font files, and my issue was due to exclusions in my .htaccess file that was whitelisting files that shouldn\'t be sent to index.php for processing. As the font file couldn\'t be loaded the characters were replaced with BLOB.As you can see, files like images, rss, and xml are excluded from the rewrite, but the font files are .woff and .woff2 files, so these also needed adding to the whitelist.Adding woff and woff2 to the whitelist allows the font files to be loaded, and the glyphicons should then display properly.I had this problem and it was caused by the variables.less file. Overriding it to set the icon-font-path value solved the problem.The file structured looks like this:Adding my own variables.less file in the root of Content and referencing this in styles.less resolved the 404 error.Variables.less contains:You must to set by this order:What worked for me was replacing routes from:to This is how you include the icon in bootstrap 3http://glyphicons.bootstrapcheatsheets.com/Hope that helps.I am using bootstrap with namespace and glyphicons not working but after adding above line in code glyphicons working fine.I just renamed the font from bootstrap.css using Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v and it worked.You must to set by this order:This answer is for anyone using Nancy (NancyFx).I have an ASP.NET-hosted NancyFX app, and I obtained Boostrap via NuGet.My glyphicons were not working, but it turned out not to be an issue of bad font files, incorrect CSS relative directory paths, or any of the other things mentioned in the other answers.The problem was that I was missing a convention, telling Nancy where to look for content. Once I realized that, the solution was simply to add the following overload to my bootstrapper file:i had a box width code \\e094 for glyphicon-arrow-down, in fact i solved the problem adding glyphicon in css class like that :if it could help someone ...
