How to remove spaces in a string? For instance:Input  : \'/var/www/site/Brand new document.docx\'\nOutput : \'/var/www/site/Brandnewdocument.docx\'ThanksThis?ExampleUpdate: Based on this question, this:is a better solution. It produces the same result, but it does it faster.The Regex\\s is the regex for "whitespace", and g is the "global" flag, meaning match ALL \\s (whitespaces). A great explanation for + can be found here.As a side note, you could replace the content between the single quotes to anything you want, so you can replace whitespace with any other string.Two ways of doing this!Click here for working example Note: Though you use \'g\' or \'gi\' for removing spaces both behaves the same.If we use \'g\' in the replace function, it will check for the exact match. but if we use \'gi\', it ignores the case sensitivity.for reference click here.You could try using this:Following @rsplak answer: actually, using split/join way is faster than using regexp. See the performance test caseSo var result = text.split(\' \').join(\'\')operates faster thanvar result = text.replace(/\\s+/g, \'\')On small texts this is not relevant, but for cases when time is important, e.g. in text analisers, especially when interacting with users, that is important.On the other hand, \\s+ handles wider variety of space characters. Among with \\n and \\t, it also matches \\u00a0 character, and that is what &nbsp; is turned in, when getting text using textDomNode.nodeValue.So I think that conclusion in here can be made as follows: if you only need to replace spaces \' \', use split/join. If there can be different symbols of symbol class - use replace(/\\s+/g, \'\')If you want to remove whitespace from both ends of a string (but not inside the string) use trim() methode, e.g.Remark:\nYou can also read about trimLeft and trimRight which remove spaces just from left/right side accordingly, but pay attention that those two are non-standard and are not on a standards track.I prever useing Lodash to remove spaces from a string:
