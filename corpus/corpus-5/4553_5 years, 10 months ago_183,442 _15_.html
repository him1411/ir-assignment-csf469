I have an app where the user can choose an image either from the built-in app images or from the iphone photo library. I use an object Occasion that has an NSString property to save the imagePath. Now in the case of the built-in app images I do get the file name as an NSString an save in the [occasion imagePath]. But in the 2nd case where the user picks an image form the photo library I get an NSURL which I want to convert to an NSString to be able to save it in [occasion imagePath].Is it possible to convert the NSURL to an NSString?More info in the docs:If you\'re interested in the pure string:If you\'re interested in the path represented by the URL (and to be used with NSFileManager methods for example):Try this in Swift :Objective-C:Swift update:I just fought with this very thing and this update didn\'t work.This eventually did in Swift:You can use any one wayor string :: file:///var/containers/Bundle/Application/E2D7570B-D5A6-45A0-8EAAA1F7476071FE/RemoDuplicateMedia.app/loading_circle_animation.gifstr :: file:///var/containers/Bundle/Application/E2D7570B-D5A6-45A0-8EAA-A1F7476071FE/RemoDuplicateMedia.app/loading_circle_animation.gif
