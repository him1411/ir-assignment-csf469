Is there a built-in way of getting the full URL of an action?I am looking for something like GetFullUrl("Action", "Controller") that would return something like http://www.fred.com/Controller/Action.The reason I am looking for this is to avoid hardcoding URLs in automated emails that are generated so that the URLs can always be generated relative to the current location of the site.There is an overload of Url.Action that takes your desired protocol (e.g. http, https) as an argument - if you specify this, you get a fully qualified URL.Here\'s an example that uses the protocol of the current request in an action method:HtmlHelper (@Html) also has an overload of the ActionLink method that you can use in razor to create an anchor element, but it also requires the hostName and fragment parameters. So I\'d just opt to use @Url.Action again:As Paddy mentioned: if you use an overload of UrlHelper.Action() that explicitly specifies the protocol to use, the generated URL will be absolute and fully qualified instead of being relative.I wrote a blog post called How to build absolute action URLs using the UrlHelper class in which I suggest to write a custom extension method for the sake of readability:You can then simply use it like that in your view:This question is specific to ASP .NET however I am sure some of you will benefit of system agnostic javascript which is beneficial in many situations.UPDATE: The way to get url formed outside of the page itself is well described in answers above. Or you could do a oneliner like following new UrlHelper(actionExecutingContext.RequestContext).Action("SessionTimeout", "Home", new {area = string.Empty}, actionExecutingContext.Request.Url!= null? actionExecutingContext.Request.Url.Scheme : "http");from filter ornew UrlHelper(this.Request.RequestContext).Action("Details", "Journey", new { area = productType }, this.Request.Url!= null? this.Request.Url.Scheme : "http");However quite often one needs to get the url of current page, for those cases using Html.Action and putting he name and controller of page you are in to me feels awkward. My preference in such cases is to use JavaScript instead. This is especially good in systems that are half re-written MVT half web-forms half vb-script half God knows what - and to get URL of current page one needs to use different method every time.One way is to use JavaScript to get URL is window.location.href another - document.URLThis may be just me being really, really picky, but I like to only define constants once. If you use any of the approaches defined above, your action constant will be defines multiple times.To avoid this, you can do the following:Then create your controllers, say for example the DataController:Then just use it like:And from your .cshtml (or any code)This is definitely a lot more work, but I rest easy knowing compile time validation is on my side.This what you need to do.I was having an issue with this, my server was running behind a load balancer. The load balancer was terminating the SSL/TLS connection. It then passed the request to the web servers using http. Using the Url.Action() method with Request.Url.Schema, it kept creating a http url, in my case to create a link in an automated email (which my PenTester didn\'t like).I may have cheated a little, but it is exactly what I needed to force a https url:I actually use a web.config AppSetting so I can use http when debugging locally, but all test and prod environments use transformation to set the https value.
