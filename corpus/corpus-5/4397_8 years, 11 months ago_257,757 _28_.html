What is the right way of initializing a static map? Do we need a static function that will initialize it? Using C++11:Using Boost.Assign:Best way is to use a function:It\'s not a complicated issue to make something similar to boost. Here\'s a class with just three functions, including the constructor, to replicate what boost did (almost).Usage:The above code works best for initialization of global variables or static members of a class which needs to be initialized and you have no idea when it gets used first but you want to assure that the values are available in it.If say, you\'ve got to insert elements into an existing std::map... here\'s another class for you.Usage:See it in action with GCC 4.7.2 here: http://ideone.com/3uYJiH############### EVERYTHING BELOW THIS IS OBSOLETE #################EDIT: The map_add_values class below, which was the original solution I had suggested, would fail when it comes to GCC 4.5+. Please look at the code above for how to add values to existing map.Usage:NOTE: Previously I used a operator [] for adding the actual values. This is not possible as commented by dalle.##################### END OF OBSOLETE SECTION #####################Here is another way that uses the 2-element data constructor. No functions are needed to initialize it. There is no 3rd party code (Boost), no static functions or objects, no tricks, just simple C++:Since I wrote this answer C++11 is out. You can now directly initialize STL containers using the new initializer list feature:I would wrap the map inside a static object, and put the map initialisation code in the constructor of this object, this way you are sure the map is created before the initialisation code is executed.Just wanted to share a pure C++ 98 work around:This is similar to PierreBdR, without copying the map.You can try:For example:If you are stuck with C++98 and don\'t want to use boost, here there is the solution I use when I need to initialize a static map:You have some very good answers here, but I\'m to me, it looks like a case of "when all you know is a hammer"...The simplest answer of to why there is no standard way to initialise a static map, is there is no good reason to ever use a static map... A map is a structure designed for fast lookup, of an unknown set of elements. If you know the elements before hand, simply use a C-array. Enter the values in a sorted manner, or run sort on them, if you can\'t do this. You can then get log(n) performance by using the stl::functions to loop-up entries, lower_bound/upper_bound. When I have tested this previously they normally perform at least 4 times faster than a map.The advantages are many fold...\n- faster performance (*4, I\'ve measured on many CPU\'s types, it\'s always around 4)\n- simpler debugging. It\'s just easier to see what\'s going on with a linear layout.\n- Trivial implementations of copy operations, should that become necessary.\n- It allocates no memory at run time, so will never throw an exception.\n- It\'s a standard interface, and so is very easy to share across, DLL\'s, or languages, etc.I could go on, but if you want more, why not look at Stroustrup\'s many blogs on the subject.
