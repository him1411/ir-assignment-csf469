I saw the ViewBag in MVC 3. How\'s that different than ViewData in MVC 2?It uses the C# 4.0 dynamic feature. It achieves the same goal as viewdata and should be avoided in favor of using strongly typed view models (the same way as viewdata should be avoided).So basically it replaces magic strings:with magic properties:for which you have no compile time safety.I continue to blame Microsoft for ever introducing this concept in MVC.The name of the properties are case sensitive.Internally ViewBag properties are stored as name/value pairs in the ViewData dictionary. Note: in most pre-release versions of MVC 3, the ViewBag property was named the ViewModel as noted in this snippet from MVC 3 release notes:(edited 10-8-12) It was suggested I post the source of this info I posted, here is the source: \nhttp://www.asp.net/whitepapers/mvc3-release-notes#_Toc2_4MVC 2 controllers support a ViewData\n  property that enables you to pass data\n  to a view template using a late-bound\n  dictionary API. In MVC 3, you can also\n  use somewhat simpler syntax with the\n  ViewBag property to accomplish the\n  same purpose. For example, instead of\n  writing ViewData["Message"]="text",\n  you can write ViewBag.Message="text".\n  You do not need to define any\n  strongly-typed classes to use the\n  ViewBag property. Because it is a\n  dynamic property, you can instead just\n  get or set properties and it will\n  resolve them dynamically at run time.\n  Internally, ViewBag properties are\n  stored as name/value pairs in the\n  ViewData dictionary. (Note: in most\n  pre-release versions of MVC 3, the\n  ViewBag property was named the\n  ViewModel property.)ViewBag vs ViewData in MVChttp://royalarun.blogspot.in/2013/08/viewbag-viewdata-tempdata-and-view.htmlSimilarities between ViewBag & ViewData :Helps to maintain data when you move from controller to view. Used to\n  pass data from controller to corresponding view. Short life means\n  value becomes null when redirection occurs. This is because their goal\n  is to provide a way to communicate between controllers and views. It\xe2\x80\x99s\n  a communication mechanism within the server call.Difference between ViewBag & ViewData:ViewData is a dictionary of objects that is derived from\n  ViewDataDictionary class and accessible using strings as keys. ViewBag\n  is a dynamic property that takes advantage of the new dynamic features\n  in C# 4.0. ViewData requires typecasting for complex data type and\n  check for null values to avoid error. ViewBag doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require\n  typecasting for complex data type.ViewBag & ViewData Example:Calling in ViewViewData:  It\xe2\x80\x99s required type casting for complex data type and check for null values to avoid error.ViewBag: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require type casting for complex data type.Consider the following example: And the code for View is as follows:All answers suggest that ViewBag and/or ViewData is to pass data from Controller to Views which is misinformation. both are very useful to pass data from Views to Layout or Partial to Views (or ViewComponents, etc) It\'s not controller exclusive.as the default asp.net sample have this in the layout page:and in any viewSo then, to asking the question: "what\'s the difference between ViewBag and ViewData?"The most notable difference is ViewData is a Strongly Typed Dictionary while\nViewBag is a dynamic type. Note that the data inside IS THE SAMEWhen to use one or another?Knowing the subtle differences, using one or another is much more a taste preference.Normally you can think of ViewBag.AnyKey to an alias of ViewData["AnyKey"]Can I recommend to you to not use either?If you want to "send" data to your screen, send a strongly typed object (A.K.A. ViewModel) because it\'s easier to test.If you bind to some sort of "Model" and have random "viewbag" or "viewdata" items then it makes automated testing very difficult.If you are using these consider how you might be able to restructure and just use ViewModels.There are some subtle differences that mean you can use ViewData and ViewBag in slightly different ways from the view.  One advantage is outlined in this post http://weblogs.asp.net/hajan/archive/2010/12/11/viewbag-dynamic-in-asp-net-mvc-3-rc-2.aspx and shows that casting can be avoided in the example by using the ViewBag instead of ViewData.viewdata: is a dictionary used to store data between View and controller , u need to cast the view data object to its corresponding model  in the view to be able to retrieve data from it ...ViewBag: is a dynamic property similar in its working to the view data, However it is better cuz it doesn\'t need to be casted to its corressponding model before using it in the view ...In this way we can make it use the values to the pass the information between the controller to other page with TEMP DATAAlthough you might not have a technical advantage to choosing one format over\nthe other, you should be aware of some important differences between the two\nsyntaxes.\nOne obvious difference is that ViewBag works only when the key you\xe2\x80\x99re accessing\nis a valid C# identifi er. For example, if you place a value in ViewData["Key\nWith Spaces"], you can\xe2\x80\x99t access that value using ViewBag because the code\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t compile.\nAnother key issue to consider is that you cannot pass in dynamic values as parameters\nto extension methods. The C# compiler must know the real type of every\nparameter at compile time in order to choose the correct extension method.\nIf any parameter is dynamic, compilation will fail. For example, this code will\nalways fail: @Html.TextBox("name", ViewBag.Name). To work around this, either\nuse ViewData["Name"] or cast the vaOne main difference I noticed between ViewData and ViewBag is:ViewData : it will return object does not matter what you have assigned into this and need to typecast again back to the original type.ViewBag : it is enough smart to return exact type what you have assigned to it it does not matter weather you have assigned simple type (i.e. int, string etc.) or complex type.Ex: Controller code.View Code.OutPut Screen.View Datahttp://www.gurujipoint.com/2017/09/view-data-viewbag-and-tempdata.htmlViewBag and ViewData are two means which are used to pass information from controller to view in ASP.Net MVC. The goal of using both mechanism is to provide the communicaton between controller and View. Both have short life that is the value of both becomes null once the redirection has occured ie, once the page has redirected from the source page (where we set the value of ViewBag or ViewData) to the target page , both ViewBag as well as ViewData becomes null.Despite having these similarities both (ViewBag and ViewData) are two different things if we talk about the implementation of both. The differences are as follows :1.) If we analyse both implementation wise then we will find that ViewData is a dictionary data structure - Dictionary of Objects derived from ViewDataDictionary and accessible using strings as Keys to these values while ViewBag makes use of the dynamic features introduced in C#4.0 and is a dynamic property.2.) While accessing the values form ViewData , we need to typecast the values (datatypes) as they are stored as Objects in the ViewData dictionary but there is no such need if we are accessing th value in case of ViewBag.3.) In ViewBag we can set the value like this : and can access as follows:While in case of ViewData the values can be set and accessed as follows: \n    Setting ViewData as follows : and accessing value like thisFor more details click here:
