Implementing a file upload under html is fairly simple, but I just noticed that there is an \'accept\' attribute that can be added to the <input type="file" ...> tag.Is this attribute useful as a way of limiting file uploads to images, etc? What is the best way to use it?Alternatively, is there a way to limit file types, preferably in the file dialog, for an html file input tag?The accept attribute is incredibly useful. It is a hint to browsers to only show files that are allowed for the current input. While it can typically be overridden by users, it helps narrow down the results for users by default, so they can get exactly what they\'re looking for without having to sift through a hundred different file types.Note: These examples were written based on the current specification and may not actually work in all (or any) browsers. The specification may also change in the future, which could break these examples.The accept attribute may be specified to provide user agents with a\n  hint of what file types will be accepted.If specified, the attribute must consist of a\n  set of comma-separated tokens,\n  each of which must be an\n  ASCII case-insensitive\n  match for one of the following:Yes, it is extremely useful in browsers that support it, but the "limiting" is as a convenience to users (so they are not overwhelmed with irrelevant files) rather than as a way to prevent them from uploading things you don\'t want them uploading.It is supported in Here is a list of content types you can use with it, followed by the corresponding file extensions (though of course you can use any file extension):Accept attribute was introduced in the RFC 1867, intending to enable file-type filtering based on MIME type for the file-select control. But as of 2008, most, if not all, browsers make no use of this attribute. Using client-side scripting, you can make a sort of extension based validation, for submit data of correct type (extension).Other solutions for advanced file uploading require Flash movies like SWFUpload or Java Applets like JUpload.In 2015 the only way I found to make it work for both Chrome and Firefox is to put all possible extensions you want to support:Problem with FF: Using the image/jpeg mime type FireFox will only show .jpg files, very strange as if the common .jpeg was not ok...Whatever you do, be sure to try with files having many different extensions.\nMaybe it even depends on the OS ...I suppose accept is case insensitive, but maybe not in every browser.It is supported by Chrome. It\'s not supposed to be used for validation, but for type hinting the OS. If you have an accept="image/jpeg" attribute in a file upload the OS can only show files of the suggested type.It\'s been a few years, and Chrome at least makes use of this attribute. This attribute is very useful from a usability standpoint as it will filter out the unnecessary files for the user, making their experience smoother. However, the user can still select "all files" from the type (or otherwise bypass the filter), thus you should always validate the file where it is actually used; If you\'re using it on the server, validate it there before using it. The user can always bypass any client-side scripting.If the browser uses this attribute, it is only as an help for the user, so he won\'t upload a multi-megabyte file just to see it rejected by the server...\nSame for the <input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="100000"> tag: if the browser uses it, it won\'t send the file but an error resulting in UPLOAD_ERR_FORM_SIZE (2) error in PHP (not sure how it is handled in other languages).\nNote these are helps for the user. Of course, the server must always check the type and size of the file on its end: it is easy to tamper with these values on the client side.Back in 2008 this wasn\'t important because of the lack of mobile OS\'es but now quite important thing. When you set accepted mime types, then in for example Android user is given system dialog with apps which can provide him the content of mime which file input accepts, what is great because navigating through files in file explorer on mobile devices is slow and often stressful.One important thing is that some mobile browsers (based on Android version of Chrome 36 and Chrome Beta 37) does not support app filtering over extension(s) and multiple mime types.
