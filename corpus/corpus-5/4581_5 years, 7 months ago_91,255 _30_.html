Is there a way to get the version set in package.json in a nodejs app? I would want something like thisI found that the following code fragment worked best for me. Since it uses \'require\' to load the package.json, it works regardless the current working directory.A warning, courtesy of @Pathogen:Doing this with browserify has security implications.\n  Be careful not to expose your package.json to the client, as it means that all your dependency version numbers, build and test commands and more are sent to the client.\n  If you\'re building server and client in the same project, you expose your server-side version numbers too.\n  Such specific data can be used by an attacker to better fit the attack your server.If your application is launched with \'npm start\', you can simply use:See package.json vars for more details.Using ES6 modules you can do the following:Here is how to read the version out of package.json:Or in plain old bash:outputsThere is another way of fetching certain information from your package.json file namely using pkginfo module.Usage of this module is very simple. You can get all package variables using:Or only certain details (version in this case)And your package variables will be set to module.exports (so version number will be accessible via module.exports.version).You could use the following code snippet:This module has very nice feature - it can be used in any file in your project (e.g. in subfolders) and it will automatically fetch information from your package.json. So you do not have to worry where you package.json is.I hope that will help.I don\'t think there is any way built into node itself, but there is nothing stopping you from just reading the file and parsing the JSON yourself with the fs module.The above is true for old Node versions. As the accepted answer states, in the current versions of Node you can simply require the JSON file. Just keep in mind that will read in synchronously and thus should not be used dynamically.I do this with findup-sync:I know this isn\'t the intent of the OP, but I just had to do this, so hope it helps the next person.If you\'re using docker-compose for your CI/CD process, you can get it this way! for the image, you can use any node image. I use alpine because it is the smallest.You can use the project-version package.ThenIt uses process.env.npm_package_version but fallback on the version written in the package.json in case the env var is missing for some reason.Just adding an answer because I came to this question to see the best way to include the version from package.json in my web application. I know this question is targetted for Node.js however, if you are using Webpack to bundle your app just a reminder the recommended way is to use the DefinePlugin to declare a global version in the config and reference that. So you could do in your webpack.config.jsonAnd then AppVersion is now a global that is available for you to use. Also make sure in your .eslintrc you ignore this via the globals propwhy not use the native way?\nthe other methods have failed for me.
