I need to find the caller of a method. Is it possible using stacktrace or reflection?According to the Javadocs:The last element of the array represents the bottom of the stack, which is the least recent method invocation in the sequence. A StackTraceElement has getClassName(), getFileName(), getLineNumber() and getMethodName().You will have to experiment to determine which index you want\n(probably stackTraceElements[1] or [2]).An alternative solution can be found in a comment to this request for enhancement.\nIt uses the getClassContext() method of a custom SecurityManager and seems to be faster than the stack trace method.The following program tests the speed of the different suggested methods (the most interesting bit is in the inner class SecurityManagerMethod):An example of the output from my 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo MacBook running Java 1.6.0_17:The internal Reflection method is much faster than the others. Getting a stack trace from a newly created Throwable is faster than getting it from the current Thread. And among the non-internal ways of finding the caller class the custom SecurityManager seems to be the fastest.As lyomi points out in this comment the sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass() method has been disabled by default in Java 7 update 40 and removed completely in Java 8. Read more about this in this issue in the Java bug database. As zammbi has found, Oracle was forced to back out of the change that removed the sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass(). It is still available in Java 8 (but it is deprecated).3 years after: Update on timing with current JVM.Sounds like you\'re trying to avoid passing a reference to this into the method.  Passing this is way better than finding the caller through the current stack trace.  Refactoring to a more OO design is even better.  You shouldn\'t need to know the caller.  Pass a callback object if necessary.This method does the same thing but a little more simply and possibly a little more performant and in the event you are using reflection, it skips those frames automatically. The only issue is it may not be present in non-Sun JVMs, although it is included in the runtime classes of JRockit 1.4-->1.6. (Point is, it is not a public class).As far as what the realFramesToSkip value should be, the Sun 1.5 and 1.6 VM versions of java.lang.System, there is a package protected method called getCallerClass() which calls sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass(3), but in my helper utility class I used 4 since there is the added frame of the helper class invocation.For example, if you try to get the calling method line for debug purpose, you need to get past the Utility class  in which you code those static methods:\n(old java1.4 code, just to illustrate a potential StackTraceElement usage)I\'ve done this before.  You can just create a new exception and grab the stack trace on it without throwing it, then examine the stack trace.  As the other answer says though, it\'s extremely costly--don\'t do it in a tight loop.I\'ve done it before for a logging utility on an app where performance didn\'t matter much (Performance rarely matters much at all, actually--as long as you display the result to an action such as a button click quickly).  It was before you could get the stack trace, exceptions just had .printStackTrace() so I had to redirect System.out to a stream of my own creation, then (new Exception()).printStackTrace(); Redirect System.out back and parse the stream.  Fun stuff.Here is a part of the code that I made based in the hints showed in this topic.\nHope it helps.(Feel free to make any suggestions to improve this code, please tell me)The counter:And the object:use this method:-Caller of method example Code is here:-Oneliner: Note that you might need to replace the 2 with 1.JEP 259 provides an efficient standard API for stack walking that allows easy filtering of, and lazy access to, the information in stack traces. Before Stack-Walking API, common ways of accessing stack frames were:Throwable::getStackTrace and Thread::getStackTrace return an array of\n  StackTraceElement objects, which contain the class name and method\n  name of each stack-trace element.SecurityManager::getClassContext is a protected method, which allows a\n  SecurityManager subclass to access the class context.JDK-internal sun.reflect.Reflection::getCallerClass method which you shouldn\'t use anywayUsing these APIs are usually inefficient:These APIs require the VM to eagerly capture a snapshot of the entire\n  stack, and they return information representing the entire stack.\n  There is no way to avoid the cost of examining all the frames if the\n  caller is only interested in the top few frames on the stack.In order to find the immediate caller\'s class, first obtain a StackWalker:Then either call the getCallerClass():or walk the StackFrames and get the first preceding StackFrame:
