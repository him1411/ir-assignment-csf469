I was surprised to find today that I couldn\'t track down any simple way to write the contents of an InputStream to an OutputStream in Java. Obviously, the byte buffer code isn\'t difficult to write, but I suspect I\'m just missing something which would make my life easier (and the code clearer).So, given an InputStream in and an OutputStream out, is there a simpler way to write the following?As WMR mentioned, org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils from Apache has a method called copy(InputStream,OutputStream) which does exactly what you\'re looking for.So, you have:...in your code.Is there a reason you\'re avoiding IOUtils? If you are using Java 7, Files (in the standard library) is the best approach:Edit: Of course it\'s just useful when you create one of InputStream or OutputStream from file. Use file.toPath() to get path from file.To write into an existing file (e.g. one created with File.createTempFile()), you\'ll need to pass the REPLACE_EXISTING copy option (otherwise FileAlreadyExistsException is thrown):I think this will work, but make sure to test it... minor "improvement", but it might be a bit of a cost at readability.Since Java 9, InputStream provides a method called transferTo with the following signature:As the documentation states, transferTo will:Reads all bytes from this input stream and writes the bytes to the\n  given output stream in the order that they are read. On return, this\n  input stream will be at end of stream. This method does not close\n  either stream. This method may block indefinitely reading from the\n  input stream, or writing to the output stream. The behavior for the\n  case where the input and/or output stream is asynchronously closed, or\n  the thread interrupted during the transfer, is highly input and output\n  stream specific, and therefore not specifiedSo in order to write contents of a Java InputStream to an OutputStream, you can write:Using Guava\'s ByteStreams.copy():If you only need this for writing an InputStream to a File then you can use this simple function:PipedInputStream and PipedOutputStream should only be used when you have multiple threads, as noted by the Javadoc.Also, note that input streams and output streams do not wrap any thread interruptions with IOExceptions... So, you should consider incorporating an interruption policy to your code:This would be an useful addition if you expect to use this API for copying large volumes of data, or data from streams that get stuck for an intolerably long time.There\'s no way to do this a lot easier with JDK methods, but as Apocalisp has already noted, you\'re not the only one with this idea: You could use IOUtils from Jakarta Commons IO, it also has a lot of other useful things, that IMO should actually be part of the JDK...Using Java7 and try-with-resources, comes with a simplified and readable version.Use Commons Net\'s Util class:The JDK uses the same code so it seems like there is no "easier" way without clunky third party libraries (which probably don\'t do anything different anyway). The following is directly copied from java.nio.file.Files.java:I think it\'s better to use a large buffer, because most of the files are greater than 1024 bytes. Also it\'s a good practice to check the number of read bytes to be positive.Here comes how I\'m doing with simplest for loop.For those who use Spring framework there is a useful StreamUtils class:The above does not close the streams. If you want the streams closed after the copy, use FileCopyUtils class instead:PipedInputStream and PipedOutputStream may be of some use, as you can connect one to the other.Another possible candidate are the Guava I/O utilities:http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/IOExplainedI thought I\'d use these since Guava is already immensely useful in my project, rather than adding yet another library for one function.A IMHO more minimal snippet (that also more narrowly scopes the length variable):As a side note, I don\'t understand why more people don\'t use a for loop, instead opting for a while with an assign-and-test expression that is regarded by some as "poor" style.Try Cactoos:More details here: http://www.yegor256.com/2017/06/22/object-oriented-input-output-in-cactoos.htmlyou can use this method
