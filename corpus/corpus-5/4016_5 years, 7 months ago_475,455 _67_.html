I want to upload my own asp.net website on the IIS through IIS manager. But when I do this I get the following error  HTTP Error 500.19 - Internal Server Error The requested page cannot be\n  accessed because the related configuration data for the page is\n  invalidI searched many times for a solution for this error but none of the solutions solved the error.I have a problem in IUSR account. I can\'t see this account in the "group or user names" in the properties of the web.config.What is the problem?The message is saying that your configuration file is corrupt in some way. However it also says that it can\'t actually access the config file. So I\'d ignore the original message about corruption/lack of validity as this is most likely just the effect of not being able to read the file due to a lack of authorization.The reason it cannot read the config file is because the process running your web app does not have permission to access the file/directory. So you need to give the process running your web app those permissions. The access rights should be fairly straightforward, i.e. at least Read, and, depending on your app, maybe Write.Above, you mention IUSR etc. not being in the properties for web.config. If by that you mean that IUSR is not listed in the security tab of the file then it\'s a good thing. One doesn\'t want to give IUSR any kind of permission to web.config. The role IUSR is an anonymous internet user.The file web.config should only be accessible through your application.The problem is you haven\'t said which OS and IIS version you are using so it\'s difficult to advise which steps to take.I.e. in IIS 7.5, the error message you\'re quoting is likely to occur due to your ApplicationPoolIdentity not being assigned the permissions. Your web application belongs to an application pool and so you need to give the permissions to the OS account that your web application\'s application pool runs under. Often this is something like NetworkService but you may have customized it to run under a purpose made account. Without more info it\'s difficult to help you.This can also happen if the site is configured to use the IIS URL Rewrite module but it is not installed.Finally I get the solution for my problem. The asp.net account not appear in the IIS manager because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t check its check Box in IIS to do this in windows 7 follow the stepsNow you will see the Asp.net account on the IIS manager and by default you see IIS account Now you should move you asp.net website from \xe2\x80\x9cmy document\xe2\x80\x9d to another place the IIS have permission to access it (to any partition on your computer) Now browse your website from IIS manager and it should work. Thanks a lot for Jeff Turner for the solutionIn my case installing IIS URL Rewrite module solved the problem.I was having the same problem, here is the solution that worked for me.Facepalm alert:You will also get this error if the path to the config file is wrong. Double-check it to make sure the  physical path is entered correctly in IIS.You need to assign permissions for IIS_IUSRS on the local machine (but you don\'t have to assign for IUSR, in fact it will work even if you explicitly deny permissions).To assign permissions, just right click on the folder and on the security tab make sure to grant the correct permissions, and if the user is not listed then click "ADD", and enter IIS_IUSRS (and make sure that under "domain" the local computer is selected, or enter in the name field YourLocalComputerName\\IIS_IUSRS), and then you are good to go.If you want you can instead of assigning permissions to the IIS_IUSRS group, you can instead assign to the app pool which should in general be "IIS APPPOOL\\ app pool name".For Visual Studio (VS) developers:\nAs hinted at by Harvey Darvey, Savage, and Snives, your Application Host Configuration may be pointing to the wrong application physical path. Search for virtualDirectory within /.vs/config/applicationhost.config to change the physicalPath if it is incorrect.Make sure the physicalPath is correct:One other possibility that fixed this problem for me:IIS -> Edit Permissions -> Security Tab -> Give "Users" appropriate permissions (or IIS_IUSRS, depending on your setup)The same thing happened with me , Try checking this by double clicking on the Connection strings on the right pane of IIS 7 when you select a website.It will give you an error (that there is some problem with web config file), because you have used URL rewrite rules and the respective component is not installed.Install \xe2\x80\x9cMicrosoft URL Rewrite Module 2.0 for IIS 7\xe2\x80\x9d and this should fix your problem Nothing here worked for me, I found this command in another SO answer though and it solved my problem. Just start command prompt as an administrator and run this command:Credit: User Vicxx Make sure you have the application pool set to the correct version of the framework. You\'ll also need to make sure your aspnet or IUSR users have read access to the application\'s directory.This also happened to me when I had a default document of the same name (like index.aspx) specified in both my web.config file AND my IIS website. I ended up removing the entry from the IIS website and kept the web.config entry like below:Sometimes this message has can be missing components in your IIS environment e.g. a particular framework, or an IIS feature like dynamic compression, rather than permissions to  web.config.  If this is the case, a solution can be to install and use the Microsoft Platform Installer and install those missing components - you might have to take a stab at what exactly is missing because the error log and message don\'t tell you.Ehm. I had moved my site/files to a different folder. Without changing the path in the IIS website.You may all laugh now.In my case, it caused by application physical path point to a non-existent folder in IIS.I do these steps to solve this problem in\nWindows Server 2012, IIS 8.5. Should work for other versions too.I had the issue as I copied my web.config file down from prod, changed everything not prod related except the Rewrite rules which were rewriting to httpS.Removed those rules and ran fine.Pretty straight forward, IIS doesn\'t have access to your web.config.  I\'d start by taking the site out of your documents folder.  Verify it has r/w permissions then as well.I too had the similar issue and i fixed it by commenting some sections in web.config file. The project was earlier built and deployed in .Net 2.0. After migrating to .Net 3.5, it started throwing the exception.If your configuration file contains "<sectionGroup name="system.web.extensions>", comment it and run as this section is already available under Machine.config.You need to set permission for your Website folder or copy they to wwwroot folder :)\n - If set permission, have 2 way:\n + Right click to Your Website folder\n + Or right click to Your Website in IIS\n => select Edit permission and Add a permission (IUSR - default iis user)\nGood luck ;-)got this problem with mapped drives, IIS doesn\'t work with mapped drives. Just use the unmapped drive.You can get this error if you have a synax error or issue in your web.config file.For me, it was a stray ampersand in a URL that I was using in the AppSettings.On the IIS 7.5 error page you get click on \'View more Information\' at the bottom of the page and in this case it will take you to the following Microsoft link:\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/942055\nThe 0x80070005 Error Code seems to be permissions related and following the steps in Resolution 2, Method 2 assigning the correct accounts with permissions on relevant folders should fix it - I spent 3 days looking for a solution until I came across it, worked straight after.In my case it works just commenting (or deleting) the anonymousAuthentication property:For me, I was getting latest from source control and this happened.The applicationhost.config file\'s virtualDirectory path was different than in my machine.I restored my own copy and it works. I am using IIS express.I ended up solving this issue by deleting the obj folder of my web application. After rebuilding the solution, problem was gone.In my case I selected application pool with .NET Framework 2.0 and enabled 32-bit application. I had .NET Framework 2.0 application.I get a "An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format" error on a SQL Server replication projectExplore the folder where your website is store and see you will get one extra folder "aspnet_client" delete that folder and it will work for you.I tried this my problem is solved.If it works for you please make it as answer so that some body else will also get solution.None of this worked for me, but I finally have a solution which worked for me:remove this line in web.config:don\'t remove this line
