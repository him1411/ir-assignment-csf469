I need to set value to a that depends on a condition.What is the shortest way to do this with CoffeeScript?E.g. this is how I\'d do it in JavaScript:Since everything is an expression, and thus results in a value, you can just use if/else.You can see more about expression examples here.See documentation.In almost any language this should work instead:Coffeescript doesn\'t support javascript ternary operator.\nHere is the reason from the coffeescript author:I love ternary operators just as much as the next guy (probably a bit\n  more, actually), but the syntax isn\'t what makes them good -- they\'re\n  great because they can fit an if/else on a single line as an\n  expression.Their syntax is just another bit of mystifying magic to memorize, with\n  no analogue to anything else in the language. The result being equal,\n  I\'d much rather have if/elses always look the same (and always be\n  compiled into an expression).So, in CoffeeScript, even multi-line ifs will compile into ternaries\n  when appropriate, as will if statements without an else clause:Both become ternaries, both can be used as expressions. It\'s consistent, and there\'s no new syntax to learn. So, thanks for the suggestion, but I\'m closing this\n  ticket as "wontfix".Please refer to the github issue: https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/issues/11#issuecomment-97802You may also write it in two statements if it mostly is true use:Or use a switch statement if you need more possibilities:With a boolean it may be oversized but i find it very readable.Multiline version (e.g. if you need to add comment after each line):
