when I tried to update my applcation with new version that has same signature as previous one, shows above error.What I am missing?If you install the application on your device via adb install you should look for the reinstall option which should be -r. So if you do adb install -r you should be able to install without uninstalling before.You are getting that error because an application with a package name same as your application already exists. If you are sure that you have not installed the same application before, change the package name and try.Else wise, here is what you can do:It might mean the application is already installed for another user on your device. Users share applications. I don\'t know why they do but they do. So if one user updates an application is updated for the other user also. If you uninstall on one, it doesn\'t remove the app from the system on the other. I ran into the same problem with a system app on a rooted phone; these can\'t be removed in Settings, and I couldn\'t use adb install -r to replace it with a different version. The solution I found was to use Titanium Backup Pro - Backup/Restore to select the app, back it up then remove it. I was then able to reinstall the replacement app of the same name without problems.
