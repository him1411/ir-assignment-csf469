Suppose I have the following string In my view, I want a link to be displayed. That is, I don\'t want everything in @x to be unescaped and displayed as a string. What\'s the difference between using?Considering Rails 3:html_safe actually "sets the string" as HTML Safe (it\'s a little more complicated than that, but it\'s basically it). This way, you can return HTML Safe strings from helpers or models at will.h can only be used from within a controller or view, since it\'s from a helper. It will force the output to be escaped. It\'s not really deprecated, but you most likely won\'t use it anymore: the only usage is to "revert" an html_safe declaration, pretty unusual.Prepending your expression with raw is actually equivalent to calling to_s chained with html_safe on it, but is declared on a helper, just like h, so it can only be used on controllers and views."SafeBuffers and Rails 3.0" is a nice explanation on how the SafeBuffers (the class that does the html_safe magic) work. I think it bears repeating: html_safe does not HTML-escape your string. In fact, it will prevent your string from being escaped.will put:into your HTML source (yay, so safe!), while:will pop up the alert dialog (are you sure that\'s what you want?). So you probably don\'t want to call html_safe on any user-entered strings.The difference is between Rails\xe2\x80\x99 html_safe() and raw(). There is an excellent post by Yehuda Katz on this, and it really boils down to this:Yes, raw() is a wrapper around html_safe() that forces the input to String and then calls html_safe() on it. It\xe2\x80\x99s also the case that raw() is a helper in a module whereas html_safe() is a method on the String class which makes a new ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer instance \xe2\x80\x94 that has a @dirty flag in it.Refer to "Rails\xe2\x80\x99 html_safe vs. raw".html_safe :Marks a string as trusted safe. It will be inserted into HTML with no additional escaping performed.raw :raw is just a wrapper around html_safe. Use raw if there are chances that the string will be nil.h alias for html_escape :A utility method for escaping HTML tag characters. Use this method to escape any unsafe content.In Rails 3 and above it is used by default so you don\'t need to use this method explicitlyIn Simple Rails terms:h remove html tags into number characters so that rendering won\'t break your htmlhtml_safe sets a boolean in string so that the string is considered as html saveraw It converts to html_safe to string The best safe way is: <%= sanitize @x %>It will avoid XSS!
