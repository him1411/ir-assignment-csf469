This question already has an answer here:When copying a file using cp to a folder that may or may not exist, how do I get cp to create the folder if necessary? Here is what I have tried:\nIf both of the following are true:then you can do this with the --parents flag of cp. From the info page (viewable at http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/cp-invocation.html#cp-invocation or with info cp or man cp):Example:To expand upon Christian\'s answer, the only reliable way to do this would be to combine mkdir and cp:As an aside, when you only need to create a single directory in an existing hierarchy, rsync can do it in one operation.  I\'m quite a fan of rsync as a much more versatile cp replacement, in fact:I didn\'t know you could do that with cp. You can do it with mkdir .. EDIT \nSee lhunath\'s answer for incorporating cp.For those that are on Mac OSX, perhaps the easiest way to work around this is to use ditto (only on the mac, AFAIK, though). It will create the directory structure that is missing in the destination.For instance, I did this where ~/work did not contain the binaries directory before I ran the command.I thought rsync should work similarly, but it seems it only works for one level of missing directories. That is,worked, because ~/work/binaries/macosx existed but not ~/work/binaries/macosx/6.3.2/One can also use the command find:There is no such option. What you can do is to run mkdir -p before copying the fileI made a very cool script you can use to copy files in locations that doesn\'t existNow just save it, give it permissions and run it usingI put -R option but it\'s just a draft, I know it can be and you will improve it in many ways. Hope it helps yoursync is work!It will create no existing paths in destination, if path have a source file inside.\nThis dont create empty directories.A moment ago i\'ve seen xxxxxxxx: No such file or directory, because i run out of free space. without error message.with ditto:once freed space cp -Rvn /source/path/* /destination/path/ works as expectedSurprisingly, I don\'t see the right answer in this thread, simply use:As usual, a simple RTFM advice is enough, the above will copy baz file in /tmp and under the subdirectories foo/bar (those will be created if they don\'t exist)
