I am trying to add an item to the options menu from a group of fragments.I have created a new MenuFragment class and extended this for the fragments I wish to include the menu item in. Here is the code:For some reason the onCreateOptionsMenu appears not to run.Call the super method:Put log statements in the code to see if the method is not being called or if the menu is not being amended by your code.Also ensure you are calling SetHasOptionsMenu in onCreate to notify the fragment that it should participate in options menu handling.If you find the onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu, MenuInflater inflater) method is not being invoked, make sure you call the following from the Fragment\'s onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) method:I had the same problem, but I think it\'s better to summarize and introduce the last step to get it working:Add setHasOptionsMenu(true) method in your Fragment\'s onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) method.Override onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu, MenuInflater inflater) (if you want to do something different in your Fragment\'s menu) and onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) methods in your Fragment.Inside your onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) Activity\'s method, make sure you return false when the menu item action would be implemented in onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) Fragment\'s method.An example:ActivityFragmentIn my case, I needed a menu to refresh a webview inside a specific Fragment, for that I used:Fragment:In the menu.xml you should add all the menu items. Then you can hide items that you don\'t want to see in the initial loading. menu.xmlAdd setHasOptionsMenu(true) in the onCreate() method to invoke the menu items in your Fragment class. FragmentClass.javaYou don\'t need to override onCreateOptionsMenu in your Fragment class again. Menu items can be changed (Add/remoev) by overriding onPrepareOptionsMenumethod available in Fragment. You need to use menu.clear() before inflating menus.andI\'ve had the same problem, my fragments were pages of a ViewPager. The reason it was happening is that I was using child fragment manager rather than the activity support fragment manager when instantiating FragmentPagerAdapter.if you want to add your menu customMenu file:Activity code:Fragment code:My problem was slightly different. I did everything right. But I was inheriting the wrong class for the activity hosting the fragment.So to be clear, if you are overriding onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu, MenuInflater inflater) in the fragment, make sure your activity class which hosts this fragment inherits android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity (in case you would want to support below API level 11).I was inheriting the android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity to support API level below 11.One thing I would add to this and the reason it was not working for me.It is similar to Napster\'s answer.Make sure your fragment\'s hosting activity extends AppCompatActivity, not FragmentActivity!From the Google Reference Documentation for FragmentActivity:Note: If you want to implement an activity that includes an action bar, you should instead use the ActionBarActivity class, which is a subclass of this one, so allows you to use Fragment APIs on API level 7 and higher.To update Napster\'s answer -- ActionBarActivity now being deprecated, use AppCompatActivity instead.When using AppCompatActivity, also make sure you set "the activity theme toTheme.AppCompat or a similar theme" (Google Doc).Note: android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity is a subclass of the android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity class (see AppCompatActivity ref doc).In your menu folder make a .menu xml file and add this xmlIn your fragment class overide this method and      Now just setup your menu xml file in fragment classSetting the options menu after creating the fragment view worked well for me.If all of the above does not work, you need to debug and make sure function onCreateOptionsMenu has been called (by placing debug or write log...)If it\'s not run, maybe your Android theme is not supporting the action bar.\nOpen AndroidManifest.xml and set the value for android:theme with theme support action bar:on your onCreate method add setHasOptionMenu()Then override your onCreateOptionsMenu
