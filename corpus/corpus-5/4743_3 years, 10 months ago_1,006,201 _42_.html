I have a JPEG file that I\'m using as a background image for a search page, and I\'m using CSS to set it because I\'m working within Backbone.js contexts:I want to apply a CSS 3 blur filter only to the background, but I\'m not sure how to style just that one element. If I try:just underneath background-image in my CSS, it styles the whole page, rather than just the background. Is there a way to select just the image and apply the filter to that? Alternatively, is there a way to just turn the blur off for every other element on the page?Check out this pen.You will have to use two different containers, one for the background image and the other for your content.In the example, I have created two containers, .background-image and .content.Both of them are placed with position: fixed and left: 0; right: 0;. The difference in displaying them comes from the z-index values which have been set differently for the elements.HTMLCSSApologies for the Lorem Ipsum Text. Thanks to Matthew Wilcoxson for a better implementation using .content:before http://codepen.io/akademy/pen/FlkzBpenAbolishing the need for an extra element, along with making the content fit within the document flow rather than being fixed/absolute like other solutions.Achieved usingOverflow auto is needed, else the background will be offset by a few pixels at the top.After this you simply needEDIT If you are interested in removing the white borders at the edges, use a width and height of 110% and a left and top of -5%. This will enlarge your backgrounds a tad - but there should be no solid colour bleeding in from the edges. Updated Pen here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/QgyewB - Thanks Chad Fawcett for the suggestion.You need to re-structure your HTML in order to do this. You have to blur the whole element in order to blur the background. So if you want to blur only the background, it has to be its own element.As stated in other answers this can be achieved with:There is a supported property called backdrop-filter, it is currently supported only in Safari and iOS Safari 9.2+ (see caniuse.com for stats).From Mozilla devdocs:The backdrop-filter property provides for effects like blurring or color shifting the area behind an element, which can then be seen through that element by adjusting the element\'s transparency/opacity.You would use it like so:Status:Please check the below code:-In the .content tab in CSS change it to position:absolute. Otherwise, the page rendered won\'t be scrollable.Although all the solutions mentioned are very clever, all seemed to have minor issues or potential knock on effects with other elements on the page when I tried them.In the end to save time I simply went back to my old solution: I used Paint.NET and went to Effects, Gaussian Blur with a radius 5 to 10 pixels and just saved that as the page image.  :-)HTML:CSS:EDIT:I finally got it working, but the solution is by no means straightforward! See here:This answer is for a Material Design horizontal card layout with dynamic height and an image.To prevent distortion of the image due to the dynamic height of the card, you could use a background placeholder image with blur to adjust for changes in height.  Just letting pep\'s know, if this already wasn\'t said. If you want to content to be scrollable, set the position of the content to absolute:I don\'t know if this was just for me, but if not that\'s the fix!Also since the background is fixed, it means you have a \'Parallax\' effect! So know not only did this person teach you how to make a blurry background, but also a parallax background effect!
