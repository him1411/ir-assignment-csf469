I\'m creating a form for sending private messages and want to set the maxlength value of a textarea appropriate to the max length of a text field in my MySQL database table. How many characters can a type text field store?If a lot, would I be able to specify length in the database text type field as I would with varchar?See for maximum numbers:\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-requirements.htmlL is the number of bytes in your text field. So the maximmum number of chars for text is 216-1 (using single-byte characters). Means 65 535 chars(using single-byte characters).UTF-8/MultiByte encoding: using MultiByte encoding each character might consume more than 1 byte of space. For UTF-8 space consumption is between 1 to 4 bytes per char.TINYTEXT: 256 bytes\nTEXT: 65,535 bytes\nMEDIUMTEXT: 16,777,215 bytes\nLONGTEXT: 4,294,967,295 bytesAcording to http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-requirements.html, the limit is L + 2 bytes, where L < 2^16, or 64k.You shouldn\'t need to concern yourself with limiting it, it\'s automatically broken down into chunks that get added as the string grows, so it won\'t always blindly use 64k.Note: If using multibyte characters, the column "Exact Max. Length Allowed" will have different length. For example: if you use 2-bytes characters, the exact maximum length for TINYTEXT would be 127 characters. Basically, it\'s the number of bytes allowed -1.How many characters can a type text field store?According to Documentation You can use maximum of 21,844 characters if the charset is UTF8If a lot, would I be able to specify length in the db text type field as I would with varchar?You dont need to specify the length. If you need more character use data types MEDIUMTEXT or LONGTEXT. With VARCHAR, specifieng length is not for Storage requirement, it is only for how the data is retrieved from data base.TINYTEXT is a string data type that can store up to to 255 characters.TEXT is a string data type that can store up to 65,535 characters. TEXT is commonly used for brief articles.LONGTEXT is a string data type with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 characters. Use LONGTEXT if you need to store large text, such as a chapter of a novel.
