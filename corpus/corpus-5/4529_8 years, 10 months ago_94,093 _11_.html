I was wondering about the best practices for indicating invalid argument combinations in Python. I\'ve come across a few situations where you have a function like so:The only annoyance with this is that every package has its own, usually slightly differing BadValueError. I know that in Java there exists java.lang.IllegalArgumentException -- is it well understood that everybody will be creating their own BadValueErrors in Python or is there another, preferred method?I would just raise ValueError, unless you need a more specific exception..There\'s really no point in doing class BadValueError(ValueError):pass - your custom class is identical in use to ValueError, so why not use that?I would inherit from ValueErrorIt is sometimes better to create your own exceptions, but inherit from a built-in one, which is as close to what you want as possible.If you need to catch that specific error, it is helpful to have a name.I\'ve mostly just seen the builtin ValueError used in this situation.I\'m not sure I agree with inheritance from ValueError -- my interpretation of the documentation is that ValueError is only supposed to be raised by builtins... inheriting from it or raising it yourself seems incorrect.Raised when a built-in operation or\n  function receives an argument that has\n  the right type but an inappropriate\n  value, and the situation is not\n  described by a more precise exception\n  such as IndexError.-- ValueError documentation
