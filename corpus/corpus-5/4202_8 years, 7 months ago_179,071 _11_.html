How do I create a GUID in Python that is platform independent? I hear there is a method using ActivePython on Windows but it\'s Windows only because it uses COM. Is there a method using plain Python?"The uuid module, in Python 2.5 and up,  provides RFC compliant UUID\ngeneration. See the module docs and the RFC for details."Docs:Example (working on 2 and 3):http://code.activestate.com/lists/python-list/72693/If you\'re using Python 2.5 or later, the uuid module is already included with the Python standard distribution.Ex: Copied from : https://docs.python.org/2/library/uuid.html (Since the links posted were not active and they keep updating)I use GUIDs as random keys for database type operations.The hexadecimal form, with the dashes and extra characters seem unnecessarily long to me. But I also like that strings representing hexadecimal numbers are very safe in that they do not contain characters that can cause problems in some situations such as \'+\',\'=\', etc..Instead of hexadecimal, I use a url-safe base64 string. The following does not conform to any UUID/GUID spec though (other than having the required amount of randomness).
