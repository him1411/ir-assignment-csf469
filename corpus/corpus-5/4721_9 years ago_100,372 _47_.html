IntroductionI\'ve always been searching for a way to make Visual Studio draw a line after a certain amount of characters.Below is a guide to enable these so called guidelines for various versions of Visual Studio.Visual Studio 2013Install Paul Harrington\'s Editor Guidelines extension for VS 2013Visual Studio 2010 and 2012Visual Studio 2008 and Other VersionsIf you are using Visual Studio 2008 open the registry at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\9.0\\Text Editor and add a new string called Guides with the value RGB(100,100,100), 80. The first part specifies the color, while the other one (80) is the column the line will be displayed. The vertical line will appear, when you restart Visual Studio.This trick also works for various other version of Visual Studio, as long as you use the correct path:This also works in SQL Server 2005 and probably other versions.This is originally from Sara\'s blog.It also works with almost any version of Visual Studio, you just need to change the "8.0" in the registry key to the appropriate version number for your version of Visual Studio.The guide line shows up in the Output window too. (Visual Studio 2010 corrects this, and the line only shows up in the code editor window.)You can also have the guide in multiple columns by listing more than one number after the color specifier:Puts a white line at column 4 and column 80.Be sure to pick a line color that will be visisble on your background. This color won\'t show up on the default background color in VS. This is the value for a light grey: RGB(221, 221, 221).Here are the registry keys that I know of:Visual Studio 2010: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\10.0\\Text EditorVisual Studio 2008: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\9.0\\Text EditorVisual Studio 2005: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\8.0\\Text EditorVisual Studio 2003: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\7.1\\Text EditorFor those running Visual Studio 2010, you may want to install the following extensions rather than changing the registry yourself:http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/0fbf2878-e678-4577-9fdb-9030389b338chttp://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7f2a6727-2993-4c1d-8f58-ae24df14ea91These are also part of the Productivity Power Tools, which includes many other very useful extensions.Without the need to edit any registry keys, the Productivity Power Tools extension (available for all versions of visual studio) provides guideline functionality.Once installed just right click while in the editor window and choose the add guide line option. Note that the guideline will always be placed on the column where your editing cursor is currently at, regardless of where you right click in the editor window.To turn off go to options and find Productivity Power Tools and in that section turn off Column Guides. A reboot will be necessary.There is now an extension for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013:http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/da227a0b-0e31-4a11-8f6b-3a149cf2e459If you are a user of the free Visual Studio Express edition the right key is in {note the VCExpress instead of VisualStudio) but it works! :)My answer is simple. Microsoft need to add an menu option within Visual Studio to achieve this common goal which programmers will benefit from greatly. Under no circumstances is it acceptable for MS to expect users to edit the registry simply to make a guideline appear in their editor. This has been a difficult issue for a very long time. It is time that somebody from MS fixed the problem properly rather than have us all desperately searching for registry entries.Mine is the real solution to the problem. Everything else is a hack. MS have BILLIONS of dollars - surely they can pay somebody to do the single days work that it will take and fix this problem once and for all for all users.PS I am using Visual Studio 2012 and it is 2014 now. Still you cannot easily make a vertical guideline appear. Is it really that difficult for MS to implement this feature correctly?This will also work in Visual Studio 2010 (Beta 2), as long as you install Paul Harrington\'s extension to enable the guidelines from the VSGallery or from the extension manager inside VS2010.  Since this is version 10.0, you should use the following registry key:Also, Paul wrote an extension that adds entries to the editor\'s context menu for adding/removing the entries without needing to edit the registry directly.  You can find it here: http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7f2a6727-2993-4c1d-8f58-ae24df14ea91I found this Visual Studio 2010 extension: Indent Guideshttp://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e792686d-542b-474a-8c55-630980e72c30It works just fine.\nThis works for SQL Server Management Studio also.With VS 2013 Express this key does not exist. What I see is HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\12.0 and there is no mention of Text Editor under that.The registry path for Visual Studio 2008 is the same, but with 9.0 as the version number:
