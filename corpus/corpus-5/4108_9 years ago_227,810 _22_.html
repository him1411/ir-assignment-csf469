How do list the symbols being exported from a .so file. If possible, I\'d also like to know their source (e.g. if they are pulled in from a static library).I\'m using gcc 4.0.2, if that makes a differenceThe standard tool for listing symbols is nm, you can use it simply like this:If you want to see symbols of a C++ library, add the "-C" option which demangle the symbols (it\'s far more readable demangled).If your .so file is in elf format, you have two options:Either objdump (-C is also useful for demangling C++):Or use readelf:If your .so file is in elf format, you can use readelf program to extract symbol information from the binary.  This command will give you the symbol table:You only should extract those that are defined in this .so file, not in the libraries referenced by it.  Seventh column should contain a number in this case.  You can extract it by using a simple regex:or, as proposed by Caspin,:I kept wondering why -fvisibility=hidden and #pragma GCC visibility did not seem to have any influence, as all the symbols were always visible with nm - until I found this post that pointed me to readelf and objdump, which made me realize that there seem to actually be two symbol tables:I think the former contains debugging symbols that can be stripped with strip or the -s switch that you can give to the linker or the install command. And even if nm does not list anything anymore, your exported symbols are still exported because they are in the ELF "dynamic symbol table", which is the latter.For shared libraries libNAME.so the -D switch was necessary to see symbols in my Linuxand for static library as reported by othersTry adding -l to the nm flags in order to get the source of each symbol.  If the library is compiled with debugging info (gcc -g) this should be the source file and line number.  As Konrad said, the object file / static library is probably unknown at this point.You can use the nm -g tool from the binutils toolchain. However, their source is not always readily available. and I\'m not actually even sure that this information can always be retrieved. Perhaps objcopy reveals further information./EDIT: The tool\'s name is of course nm. The flag -g is used to show only exported symbols.For Android .so files, the NDK toolchain comes with the required tools mentioned in the other answers: readelf, objdump and nm.nm -g  list the extern variable, which is not necessary exported symbol.\nAny non-static file scope variable(in C) are all extern variable.nm -D  will list the symbol in the dynamic table, which you can find it\'s address by dlsym.nm --version GNU nm 2.17.50.0.6-12.el5 20061020
