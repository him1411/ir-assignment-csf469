Zero is always zero, so it doesn\'t matter. But in a recent discussion with my friend he said that octal literals are almost unused today. Then it dawned upon me that actually almost all integer literals in my code are octal, namely 0.Is 0 an octal literal according to the C++ grammar? What does the standard say?Yes, 0 is an Octal literal in C++.  As per the C++ Standard:2.14.2 Integer literals [lex.icon] Any integer value prefixed with 0 is an octal value. I.e.: 01 is octal 1, 010 is octal 10, which is decimal 8, and 0 is octal 0 (which is decimal, and any other, 0).So yes, \'0\' is an octal.That\'s plain English translation of the grammar snippet in @Als\'s answer :-)An integer prefixed with 0x is not prefixed with 0. 0x is an explicitly different prefix. Apparently there are people who cannot make this distinction.As per that same standard, if we continue:Apparently all integer literals starting with zero are in fact octal. This means that it includes 0 as well. This makes little difference since zero is zero. But not knowing this fact can hurt you.I realized this when I was trying to write a program to convert binary numbers to decimal and hexidecimal output. Everytime that I was giving a number starting with zero I was getting the wrong output (For example, 012 = 10, not 12).It\'s good to know this information so you don\'t make the same mistake.
