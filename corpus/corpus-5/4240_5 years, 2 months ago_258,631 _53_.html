When writing a CSS media query, is there any way you can specify multiple conditions with "OR" logic?I\'m attempting to do something like this:Use a comma to specify two (or more) different rules:From https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/Media_queries/...In addition, you can combine multiple media queries in a comma-separated list; if any of the media queries in the list is true, the associated style sheet is applied.  This is the equivalent of a logical "or" operation.The quick answer.Separate rules with commas:\n@media handheld, (min-width: 650px), (orientation: landscape) { ... }The long answer.There\'s a lot here, but I\'ve tried to make it information dense, not just fluffy writing. It\'s been a good chance to learn myself! Take the time to systematically read though and I hope it will be helpful.Media queries essentially are used in web design to create device- or situation-specific browsing experiences; this is done using the @media declaration within a page\'s CSS. This can be used to display a webpage differently under a large number of circumstances: whether you are on a tablet or TV with different aspect ratios, whether your device has a color or black-and-white screen, or, perhaps most frequently, when a user changes the size of their browser or switches between browsing devices with varying screen sizes (very generally speaking, designing like this is referred to as Responsive Web Design)In designing for these situations, there appear to be four Logical Operators that can be used to require more complex combinations of requirements when targeting a variety of devices or viewport sizes.(Note: If you don\'t understand the the differences between media rules, media queries, and feature queries, browse the bottom section of this answer first to get a bit better acquainted with the terminology associated with media query syntax1. AND (and keyword)Requires that all conditions specified must be met before the styling rules will take effect.@media screen and (min-width: 700px) and (orientation: landscape) { ... }The specified styling rules won\'t go into place unless all of the following evaluate as true:Note: I believe that used together, these three feature queries make up a single media query.2. OR (Comma-separated lists)Rather than an or keyword, comma-separated lists are used in chaining multiple media queries together to form a more complex media rule@media handheld, (min-width: 650px), (orientation: landscape) { ... }The specified styling rules will go into effect once any one media query evaluates as true:3. NOT (not keyword)The not keyword can be used to negate a single media query (and NOT a full media rule--meaning that it only negates entries between a set of commas and not the full media rule following the @media declaration). Similarly, note that the not keyword negates media queries, it cannot be used to negate an individual feature query within a media query.*@media not screen and (min-resolution: 300dpi), (min-width: 800px) { ... }The styling specified here will go into effect ifIn other words, if the media type is \'screen\' and the min-resolution is 300 dpi, the rule will not go into effect unless the min-width of the viewport is at least 800 pixels.(The not keyword can be a little funky to state. Let me know if I can do better. ;)4. ONLY (only keyword)As I understand it, the only keyword is used to prevent older browsers from misinterpreting newer media queries as the earlier-used, narrower media type. When used correctly, older/non-compliant browsers should just ignore the styling altogether.<link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (color)" href="example.css" />An older / non-compliant browser would just ignore this line of code altogether, I believe as it would read the only keyword and consider it an incorrect media type. (See here and here for more info from smarter people) FOR MORE INFOFor more info (including more features that can be queried), see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries#Logical_operatorsNote: I needed to learn the following terminology for everything here to make sense, particularly concerning the not keyword. Here it is as I understand it:A media rule (MDN also seems to call these media statements) includes the term @media with all of its ensuing media queries@media all and (min-width: 800px)@media only screen and (max-resolution:800dpi), not print@media screen and (min-width: 700px), (orientation: landscape)@media handheld, (min-width: 650px), (min-aspect-ratio: 1/1)A media query is a set of feature queries. They can be as simple as one feature query or they can use the and keyword to form a more complex query. Media queries can be comma-separated to form more complex media rules (see the or keyword above).screen (Note: Only one feature query in use here.)only screenonly screen and (max-resolution:800dpi)only tv and (device-aspect-ratio: 16/9) and (color)NOT handheld, (min-width: 650px). (Note the comma: there are two media queries here.)A feature query is the most basic portion of a media rule and simply concerns a given feature and its status in a given browsing situation.screen(min-width: 650px)(orientation: landscape)(device-aspect-ratio: 16/9)Code snippets and information derived from: CSS media queries by Mozilla Contributors (licensed under CC-BY-SA 2.5).
