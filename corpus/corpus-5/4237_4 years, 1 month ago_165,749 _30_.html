I have a web service that receives data in JSON format, processes the data, and then returns the result to the requester.I want to measure the request, response, and total time using cURL.My example request looks like:and I currently measure this using the time command in Linux:The time command only measures total time, though - which isn\'t quite what I am looking for.Is there any way to measure request and response times using cURL?From this brilliant blog post...  https://blog.josephscott.org/2011/10/14/timing-details-with-curl/cURL supports formatted output for the details of the request (see the cURL manpage for details, under -w, \xe2\x80\x93write-out <format>). For our purposes we\xe2\x80\x99ll focus just on the timing details that are provided.Create a new file, curl-format.txt, and paste in:Make a request:Or on Windows, it\'s...-w "@curl-format.txt" tells cURL to use our format file \n-o /dev/null redirects the output of the request to /dev/null\n-s\n tells cURL not to show a progress meter\n"http://wordpress.com/" is\n the URL we are requesting. Use quotes particularly if your URL has "&" query string parametersPut this command in CURLTIME.BAT (in the same folder as curl.exe)Then you can simply call...Here is the answer:All of the variables used with -w can be found in man curl.A shortcut you can add to your .bashrc etc, based on other answers here:Usage:To measure response time with curl use following command:To get different types of times use following command:Source: Get response time with curlIf you want to analyze or summarize the latency you can try apache bench:For example:It will show:I made a friendly formatter for sniffing curl requests to help with debugging ( see comments for usage ).  It contains\'s every known output parameter you can write out in an easy to read format.https://gist.github.com/manifestinteractive/ce8dec10dcb4725b8513Hey is better than Apache Bench, has fewer issues with SSL
