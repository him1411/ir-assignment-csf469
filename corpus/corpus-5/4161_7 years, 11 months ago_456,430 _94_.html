I\'m using Java\'s java.util.Date class in Scala and want to compare a Date object and the current time. I know I can calculate the delta by using getTime():However, this just leaves me with a long representing milliseconds. Is there any simpler, nicer way to get a time delta?The JDK Date API is horribly broken unfortunately.  I recommend using Joda Time library.Joda Time has a concept of time Interval:EDIT: By the way, Joda has two concepts: Interval for representing an interval of time between two time instants (represent time between 8am and 10am), and a Duration that represents a length of time without the actual time boundaries (e.g. represent two hours!)If you only care about time comparisions, most Date implementations (including the JDK one) implements Comparable interface which allows you to use the Comparable.compareTo()And then can you call:to get the diff of the 2 dates in minutes unit.TimeUnit is java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, a standard Java enum going from nanos to days.http://ideone.com/5dXeu6The output is something like Map:{DAYS=1, HOURS=3, MINUTES=46, SECONDS=40, MILLISECONDS=0, MICROSECONDS=0, NANOSECONDS=0}, with the units ordered.You just have to convert that map to an user-friendly string.The above code snippets compute a simple diff between 2 instants. It can cause problems during a daylight saving switch, like explained in this post. This means if you compute the diff between dates with no time you may have a missing day/hour.In my opinion the date diff is kind of subjective, especially on days. You may:count the number of 24h elapsed time: day+1 - day = 1 day = 24hcount the number of elapsed time, taking care of daylight savings: day+1 - day = 1 = 24h (but using midnight time and daylight savings it could be 0 day and 23h)count the number of day switches, which means day+1 1pm - day 11am = 1 day, even if the elapsed time is just 2h (or 1h if there is a daylight saving :p)My answer is valid if your definition of date diff on days match the 1st caseIf you are using JodaTime you can get the diff for 2 instants (millies backed ReadableInstant) dates with:But you can also get the diff for Local dates/times:Note that this works with UTC dates, so the difference may be a day off if you look at local dates. And getting it to work correctly with local dates requires a completely different approach due to daylight savings time.You need to define your problem more clearly. You could just take the number of milliseconds between the two Date objects and divide by the number of milliseconds in 24 hours, for example... but:http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/faq.html#datediffUsing the java.time framework built into Java 8+:Output: ISO-8601: PT24H10MMinutes: 1450For more info, see the Oracle Tutorial and the ISO 8601 standard.A slightly simpler alternative: As for "nicer": well, what exactly do you need? The problem with representing time durations as a number of hours and days etc. is that it may lead to inaccuracies and wrong expectations due to the complexity of dates (e.g. days can have 23 or 25 hours due to daylight savings time).d.toString(): PT2H34M56Sd.toMinutes(): 154d.toMinutesPart(): 34The sensible standard ISO 8601 defines a concise textual representation of a span of time as a number of years, months, days, hours, etc. The standard calls such such a span a duration. The format is PnYnMnDTnHnMnS where the P means "Period", the T separates the date portion from the time portion, and in between are numbers followed by a letter.Examples:The java.time framework built into Java 8 and later supplants the troublesome old java.util.Date/.Calendar classes. The new classes are inspired by the highly successful Joda-Time framework, intended as its successor, similar in concept but re-architected. Defined by JSR 310. Extended by the ThreeTen-Extra project. See the Tutorial.The java.time classes have split this idea of representing a span of time as a number of years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds into two halves:Here is an example.Dump to console.Both Period and Duration use the ISO 8601 standard for generating a String representation of their value.now: 2015-11-26T00:46:48.016-05:00[America/Montreal] to future: 2015-11-26T00:46:48.016-05:00[America/Montreal] = PT1H3MJava 9 adds methods to Duration to get the days part, hours part, minutes part, and seconds part.You can get the total number of days or hours or minutes or seconds or milliseconds or nanoseconds in the entire Duration.In Java 9 the Duration class gets new methods for returning the various parts of days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds/nanoseconds. Call the to\xe2\x80\xa6Part methods: toDaysPart(), toHoursPart(), and so on.If you only care about a simpler larger granularity of time, such as \xe2\x80\x9cnumber of days elapsed\xe2\x80\x9d, use the ChronoUnit enum.Another example.120The java.time framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old legacy date-time classes such as java.util.Date, Calendar, & SimpleDateFormat.The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration to java.time.To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial. And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is JSR 310.Where to obtain the java.time classes? The ThreeTen-Extra project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time. You may find some useful classes here such as Interval, YearWeek, YearQuarter, and more.UPDATE: The Joda-Time project is now in maintenance mode, with the team advising migration to the java.time classes. I leave this section intact for history.The Joda-Time library uses ISO 8601 for its defaults. Its Period class parses and generates these PnYnMnDTnHnMnS strings.Renders:Using millisecond approach can cause problems in some locales.Lets take, for example, the difference between the two dates 03/24/2007 and 03/25/2007 should be 1 day; However, using the millisecond route, you\'ll get 0 days, if you run this in the UK! Better way to implement this is to use java.util.CalendarThere are many ways you can find the difference between dates & times.  One of the simplest ways that I know of would be:The print statement is just an example - you can format it however you like.If you don\'t want to use JodaTime or similar, the best solution is probably this:The number of ms per day is not always the same (because of daylight saving time and leap seconds), but it\'s very close, and at least deviations due to daylight saving time cancel out over longer periods. Therefore dividing and then rounding will give a correct result (at least as long as the local calendar used does not contain weird time jumps other than DST and leap seconds).Note that this still assumes that date1 and date2 are set to the same time of day. For different times of day, you\'d first have to define what "date difference" means, as pointed out by Jon Skeet.Take a look at Joda Time, which is an improved Date/Time API for Java and should work fine with Scala.Subtracting the dates in milliseconds works (as described in another post), but you have to use HOUR_OF_DAY and not HOUR when clearing the time parts of your dates:Let me show difference between Joda Interval and Days:If you need a formatted return String like\n"2 Days 03h 42m 07s", try this:Since all the answers here are correct but use legacy java or 3rd party libs like joda or similar, I will just drop another way using new java.time classes in Java 8 and later. See Oracle Tutorial.Use LocalDate and ChronoUnit:Check example here http://www.roseindia.net/java/beginners/DateDifferent.shtml\nThis example give you difference in days, hours, minutes, secs and milli sec\'s :).Use GMT time zone to get an instance of the Calendar, set the time using the set method of Calendar class. The GMT timezone has 0 offset (not really important) and daylight saving time flag set to false.Following code can give you the desired output:Best thing to do isThat number is the number of milliseconds in a day. One date-other date gives you difference in milliseconds. Collect the answer in a double variable.That\'s probably the most straightforward way to do it - perhaps it\'s because I\'ve been coding in Java (with its admittedly clunky date and time libraries) for a while now, but that code looks "simple and nice" to me!Are you happy with the result being returned in milliseconds, or is part of your question that you would prefer to have it returned in some alternative format?Not using the standard API, no. You can roll your own doing something like this:Or you can use Joda:Note: startDate and endDates are -> java.util.Date Similar to days, you can also  get hours, minutes and secondsJust to answer the initial question:Put the following code in a Function like Long getAge(){}The most important here is to work with long numbers when multiplying and dividing. And of course, the offset that Java applies in its calculus of Dates.:)Just use below method with two Date objects. If you want to pass current date, just pass new Date() as a second parameter as it is initialised with current time.Also, apart from from number of days, if, you want other parameter difference too, use below snippet,P.S Code is entirely taken from an SO answer.try this: you can edit the string in the parse() methods param.Since you are using Scala, there is a very good Scala library Lamma. With Lamma you can minus date directly with - operatorEarlier versions of Java you can try.
