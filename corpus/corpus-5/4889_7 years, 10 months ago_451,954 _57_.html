I have these nested divs and I need the main container to expand (in height) to accomodate the DIVs insideCSS is this:The problem I have is that #main_content doesn\'t stretch to accomodate all the inner divs, with the result that they keep going against the background.How can I solve this?You need to force a clear:both before the #main_content div is closed. I would probably move the <br class="clear" />; into the #main_content div and set the CSS to be:Update: This question still gets a fair amount of traffic, so I wanted to update the answer with a modern alternative using a new layout mode in CSS3 called Flexible boxes or Flexbox: Most modern browsers currently support Flexbox and viewport units, but if you have to maintain support for older browsers, make sure to check compatibility for the specific browser version.Try this:\noverflow: auto;It worked for my problem..add the following:to your main div. Eliminates the need for the extra <br /> for the clear. as an alternative way you can also try this that may be usefull in some situations jsFiddleThw following should work:I would just usein your div. Yes, I know I\'m a-little late but I figured this might help somebody like it would have helped me if it was here.Use the span tag with display:inline-block css attached to it. You can then use CSS and manipulate it like a div in lots of ways but if you don\'t include a width or height it expands and retracts based on its content.Hope that helps.Typically I think this can be resolved by forcing a clear:both rule on the last child-element of the #items_list.You can either use:Or, if you\'re using a dynamic language, add an additional class to the last element generated in whatever loop creates the list itself, so you end up with something in your html like:and cssThis problem arises when the Child elements of a Parent Div are floated. Here is the Latest Solution of the problem:In your CSS file write the following class called .clearfix along with the pseudo selector :after Then, in your HTML, add the .clearfix class to your parent Div. For example:It should work always. You can call the class name as .group instead of .clearfix , as it will make the code more semantic.\nNote that, it is Not necessary to add the dot or even a space in the value of Content between the double quotation "". Also, overflow: auto; might solve the problem but it causes other problems like showing the scroll-bar and is not recommended.Source: Blog of Lisa Catalano and Chris Coyieradd a float property to the #main_content div - it will then expand to contain its floated contentsLooks like this worksIt takes the screen size as minimum, and if the content expands it grows.Before to do anything check for css rules with:Remove if exist and don\'t need them.In CSS: #clear_div{clear:both;}After the div tag of the inner div add this new following div http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_clear.asp :  for more informationI\'m running into this on a project myself - I had a table inside a div that was spilling out of the bottom of the div. None of the height fixes I tried worked, but I found a weird fix for it, and that is to put a paragraph at the bottom of the div with just a period in it. Then style the "color" of the text to be the same as the background of the container. Worked neat as you please and no javascript required. A non-breaking space will not work - nor does a transparent image. Apparently it just needed to see that there is some content below the table in order to stretch to contain it. I wonder if this will work for anyone else.This is the sort of thing that makes designers resort to table-based layouts - the amount of time I\'ve spent figuring this stuff out and making it cross-browser compatible is driving me crazy. I added Bootstrap to a project with section tags that I had set to 100% of screen height. It worked well until I made the project responsive, at which point I borrowed part of jennyfofenny\'s answer so my section background matched background of the content when the screen size changed on smaller screens.My new section CSS looks like this:Let\'s say you\'ve got a section that\'s a certain color. By using min-height, if the width of the section shrinks because of a smaller-screen, the height of the section will expand, the content will stay within the section, and your background will stay the desired color.I tried this and it workedFloated elements do not occupy the space inside of the parent element, As the name suggests they float! Thus if a height is explicitly not provided to an element having its child elements floated, then the parent element will appear to shrink & appear to not accepting dimensions of the child element, also if its given overflow:hidden; its children may not appear on screen. There are multiple ways to deal with this problem:Insert another element below the floated element with clear:both; property, or use clear:both; on :after of the floated element.Use display:inline-block; or flex-box instead of float.If you are using jQuery UI, they already have a class the works just a charm \nadd a <div> at the bottom inside the div that you want expand with height:auto;\nthen add a class name ui-helper-clearfix or use this style attribute and add just like below:add jQuery UI class to the clear div, not the div the you want to expand.I know this is kind of old thread, however, this can be achieved with min-height CSS property in a clean way, so I\'ll leave this here for future references:I made a fiddle based on the OP posted code here: http://jsfiddle.net/U5x4T/1/, as you remove and add divs inside, you\'ll notice how does the container expands or reduces in sizeThe only 2 things you need to achieve this, additional to the OP code is:*Overflow in the main container (required for the floating divs)*min-height css property, more info available here: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_min-height.aspAdded display:inline to the div and it grew auto ( not the scroll stuff ) when height content got bigger then the set div height of 200px No need to use a lot of CSS, just use bootstrap, then use:for the div that needs to be filled.You can get bootstrap from here
