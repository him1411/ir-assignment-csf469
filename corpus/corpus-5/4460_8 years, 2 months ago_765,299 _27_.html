Is \\n the universal newline character sequence in Javascript for all platforms? If not, how do I determine the character for the current environment?I\'m not asking about the HTML newline element (<BR/>). I\'m asking about the newline character sequence used within JavaScript strings.I\'ve just tested a few browsers using this silly bit of JavaScript:IE8 and Opera 9 on Windows use \\r\\n. All the other browsers I tested (Safari 4 and Firefox 3.5 on Windows, and Firefox 3.0 on Linux) use \\n. They can all handle \\n just fine when setting the value, though IE and Opera will convert that back to \\r\\n again internally. There\'s a SitePoint article with some more details called Line endings in Javascript.Note also that this is independent of the actual line endings in the HTML file itself (both \\n and \\r\\n give the same results).When submitting the form, all browsers canonicalize newlines to \\r\\n (%0D%0A in URL encoding).I don\'t think you really need to do much of any determining, though. If you just want to split the text on newlines, you could do something like this:Yes, it is universal.Although \'\\n\' is the universal newline characters, you have to keep in mind that, depending on your input, new line characters might be preceded by carriage return characters (\'\\r\').It might be easiest to just handle all cases of the new line character instead of checking which case then applying it.  For example, if you need to replace the newline then do the following:Don\'t use \\n, Just try this:Just enter a back-slash and keep on truckin\'! Works like a charm.yes use \\n, unless you are generating html code, in which you want to use <br />Email link function i use "%0D%0A"[HTML]Get a line separator for the current browser:A note - when using ExtendScript JavaScript (the Adobe Scripting language used in applications like Photoshop CS3+), the character to use is "\\r". "\\n" will be interpreted as a font character, and many fonts will thus have a block character instead.For example (to select a layer named \'Note\' and add line feeds after all periods):I had the problem of expressing newline with \\n or \\r\\n.\nMagically the character \\r which is used for carriage return worked for me like a newline.\nSo in some cases, it is useful to consider \\r too.In the response to Nilay above (I cannot comment, not enough reputation):any one know this type of code for tab key? i am tried "%0D%09" but\n  not working. \xe2\x80\x93 Nilay Sep 26 \'15 at 13:57Tab is a single character, so if you try just %09 it should be fine.\nAn example to see the individual character codes:I believe it is -- when you are working with JS strings.If you are generating HTML, though, you will have to use <br /> tags (not \\n, as you\'re not dealing with JS anymore)You can use `` quotes (wich are below Esc button) with ES6. So you can write something like this:The \\n is just fine for all cases I\'ve encountered. I you are working with web, use \\n and don\'t worry about it (unless you have had any newline-related issues).you can use <br/> and the document.write/, document.writeln one.
