I have tried to delay - or put to sleep - my Java program, but an error occurs.I\'m unable to use Thread.sleep(x) or wait(). The same error message appears: unreported exception java.lang.InterruptedException; must be caught or declared to be thrown.Is there any step required before using the Thread.sleep() or wait() methods?You have a lot of reading ahead of you. From compiler errors through exception handling, threading and thread interruptions. But this will do what you want:As other users have said you should surround your call with a try{...} catch{...} block. But since Java 1.5 was released, there is TimeUnit class which do the same as Thread.sleep(millis) but is more convenient.\nYou can pick time unit for sleep operation.Also it has additional methods: \nTimeUnit Oracle DocumentationHave a look at this excellent brief post on how to do this properly. Essentially: catch the InterruptedException. Remember that you must add this catch-block. The post explains this a bit further.Use the following coding construct to handle exceptionsPut your Thread.sleep in a try catch block When using Android (the only time when I use Java) I would recommend using a handler instead putting the thread to sleep.Reference: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.htmlTry this:My ways to add delay to a Java program.This is for sequential delay but for Loop delays refer to Java Delay/Wait.eg:-Alternatively, if you don\'t want to deal with threads, try this method:It starts when you call it, and ends when the number of seconds have passed.
