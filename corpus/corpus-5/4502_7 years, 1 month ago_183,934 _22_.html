I\'ve tried git branch -r, but that only lists remote branches that I\'ve tracked locally. How do I find the list of those that I haven\'t? (It doesn\'t matter to me whether the command lists all remote branches or only those that are untracked.)remote show shows all the branches on the remote, including those that are not tracked locally and even those that have not yet been fetched.It also tries to show the status of the branches relative to your local repo:But git branch -arshould do it.Using git branch -r lists all remote branches and git branch -a lists all branches on local and remote.  These lists get outdated though.  To keep these lists up-to-date, runwhich will update your local branch list with all new ones from the remote and remove any that are no longer there.  Running this update command without the --prune will retrieve new branches but not delete ones no longer on the remote.You can speed up this update by specifying a remote, otherwise it will pull updates from all remotes you have added, like soYou also may do git fetch followed by a git branch -r. Without fetch you will not see the most current branches.Git Branching - Remote BranchesGit documentation.The best command to run is git remote show [remote]. This will show all branches, remote and local, tracked and untracked.Here\'s an example from an open source project:If we just want to get the remote branches, we can use grep. The command we\'d want to use would be:With this command:You can also create an alias for this:Then you can just run git branches.The simplest way I found:I ended up doing a mess shell pipeline to get what I wanted, just merged branches from the origin remote:Make sure that the remote origin you are listing is really the repository that you want and not an older clone.  try
