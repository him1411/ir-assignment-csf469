I\'m trying to share data across controllers. Use-case is a multi-step form, data entered in one input is later used in multiple display locations outside the original controller. Code below and in jsfiddle here.HTMLJSAny help is greatly appreciated.A simple solution is to have your factory return an object and let your controllers work with a reference to the same object:JS:HTML:Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/HEdJF/When applications get larger, more complex and harder to test you might not want to expose the entire object from the factory this way, but instead give limited access for example via getters and setters:With this approach it is up to the consuming controllers to update the factory with new values, and to watch for changes to get them:HTML:Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/27mk1n1o/I prefer not to use $watch for this. Instead of assigning the entire service to a controller\'s scope you can assign just the data.JS:HTML:Alternatively you can update the service data with a direct method.JS: There are many ways you can share the data between controllers I am not going to explain as its already explained by someoneusing $state.go$stateparam works in a similar way to $state.go, you pass it as object from sender controller and collect in receiver controller using stateparamusing $rootscope(a) sending data from child to parent controller(b) sending data from parent to child controllerI\'ve created a factory that controls shared scope between route path\'s pattern, so you can maintain the shared data just when users are navigating in the same route parent path.So, if the user goes to another route path, for example \'/Support\', the shared data for path \'/Customer\' will be automatically destroyed. But, if instead of this the user goes to \'child\' paths, like \'/Customer/1\' or \'/Customer/list\' the the scope won\'t be destroyed.You can see an sample here: http://plnkr.co/edit/OL8of9There is another way without using $watch, using angular.copy:There are multiple ways to do this.Events - already explained well.ui router - explained above.**Not sure where I picked up this pattern but for sharing data across controllers and reducing the $rootScope and $scope this works great. It is reminiscent of a data replication where you have publishers and subscribers.  Hope it helps.The Service:The Controller that is getting the new data, which is the Publisher would do something like this..The Controller that is also using this new data, which is called the Subscriber would do something like this...This will work for any scenario.  So when the primary controller is initialized and it gets data it would call the changeData method which would then broadcast that out to all the subscribers of that data.  This reduces the coupling of our controllers to each other.There are multiple ways to share data between controllers  As we know $rootscope is not preferable way for data transfer or communication because it is a global scope which is available for entire applicationFor data sharing between Angular Js controllers Angular services are best practices eg. .factory, .service\nFor referenceIn case of data transfer from parent to child controller you can directly access parent data in child controller through $scope\nIf you are using ui-router then you can use $stateParmas to pass url parameters like id, name, key, etc$broadcast is also good way to transfer data between controllersHTMLJSRefer given link to know more about $broadcastJust do it simple (tested with v1.3.15):
