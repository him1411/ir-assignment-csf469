Is there any efficiency difference in an explicit vs implicit inner join?\nFor example:vs.Performance wise, they are exactly the same (at least in SQL Server).PS: Be aware that the IMPLICIT OUTER JOIN syntax is deprecated since SQL Server 2005. (The IMPLICIT OUTER JOIN syntax as used in the question is still supported)Deprecation of "Old Style" JOIN Syntax: Only A Partial ThingPersonally I prefer the join syntax as its makes it clearer that the tables are joined and how they are joined. Try compare larger SQL queries where you selecting from 8 different tables and you have lots of filtering in the where. By using join syntax you separate out the parts where the tables are joined, to the part where you are filtering the rows.On MySQL 5.1.51, both queries have identical execution plans:table1 has 166208 rows; table2 has about 1000 rows.This is a very simple case; it doesn\'t by any means prove that the query optimizer wouldn\'t get confused and generate different plans in a more complicated case.The second syntax has the unwanted possibility of a cross join: you can add tables to the FROM part without corresponding WHERE clause. This is considered harmful.The first answer you gave uses what is known as ANSI join syntax, the other is valid and will work in any relational database.I agree with grom that you should use ANSI join syntax. As they said, the main reason is for clarity. Rather than having a where clause with lots of predicates, some of which join tables and others restricting the rows returned with the ANSI join syntax you are making it blindingly clear which conditions are being used to join your tables and which are being used to restrict the results.@lomaxx:  Just to clarify, I\'m pretty certain that both above syntax are supported by SQL Serv 2005.  The syntax below is NOT supported howeverSpecifically, the outer join (*=) is not supported.Performance wise, they are exactly the same (at least in SQL Server) but be aware that they are deprecating this join syntax and it\'s not supported by sql server2005 out of the box.I think you are thinking of the deprecated *= and =* operators vs. "outer join".I have just now tested the two formats given, and they work properly on a SQL Server 2008 database.  In my case they yielded identical execution plans, but I couldn\'t confidently say that this would always be true.On some databases (notably Oracle) the order of the joins can make a huge difference to query performance (if there are more than two tables). On one application, we had literally two orders of magnitude difference in some cases. Using the inner join syntax gives you control over this - if you use the right hints syntax.You didn\'t specify which database you\'re using, but probability suggests SQL Server or MySQL where there it makes no real difference.As Leigh Caldwell has stated, the query optimizer can produce different query plans based on what functionally looks like the same SQL statement. For further reading on this, have a look at the following two blog postings:-One posting from the Oracle Optimizer TeamAnother posting from the "Structured Data" blogI hope you find this interesting.Performance wise, it should not make any difference. The explicit join syntax seems cleaner to me as it clearly defines relationships between tables in the from clause and does not clutter up the where clause.In my experience, using the cross-join-with-a-where-clause syntax often produces a brain damaged execution plan, especially if you are using a Microsoft SQL product.  The way that SQL Server attempts to estimate table row counts, for instance, is savagely horrible.  Using the inner join syntax gives you some control over how the query is executed.  So from a practical point of view, given the atavistic nature of current database technology, you have to go with the inner join.
