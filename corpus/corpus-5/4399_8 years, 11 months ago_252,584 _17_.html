If I download a .gem file to a folder in my computer, can I install it later using gem install?Yup, when you do gem install, it will search the current directory first, so if your .gem file is there, it will pick it up. I found it on the gem reference, which you may find handy as well:gem install will install the named\n  gem. It will attempt a local\n  installation (i.e. a .gem file in the\n  current directory), and if that fails,\n  it will attempt to download and\n  install the most recent version of the\n  gem you want.Also, you can use gem install --local path_to_gem/filename.gemThis will skip the usual gem repository scan that happens when you leave off --local.You can find other magic with gem install --help.you can also use the full filename to your gem file:this works as well -- it\'s probably the easiest wayIf you create your gems with bundler:You can install them with rake after they are written:Chances are, that your downloaded gem will know rake install, too.if you download the project file from github or other scm host site, use gem build to build the project first, so you can get a whatever.gem file in current directory. Then gem install it!Go to the path in where the gem is and call gem install -l gemname.gemIf you want to work on a locally modified fork of a gem, the best way to do so isgem \'pry\', path: \'./pry\'in a Gemfile.... where ./pry would be the clone of your repository. Simply run bundle install once, and any changes in the gem sources you make are immediately reflected. With gem install pry/pry.gem, the sources are still moved into GEM_PATH and you\'ll always have to run both bundle gem pry and gem update to test.
