I got this error when I requested to update the PHP version from 5.2.17 to PHP 5.3.21 on the server.You probably need to put the timezone in a configuration line in your php.ini file. You should have a block like this in your php.ini file:If not, add it (replacing the timezone by yours). After configuring, make sure to restart httpd (service httpd restart).Here is the list of supported timezones.If you cannot modify your php.ini configuration, you could as well use the following snippet at the beginning of your code:The list of timezones can be found at http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php.Add the following in your index.php file. I first came across this when I moved my application from my XAMPP server to Apache 2.2 and PHP 5.4...I would advise you do it in your index.php file instead of the php.ini file.If these are not your optionsInstead of date you could use gmdate.I have used gmdate( "Y" ) when I needed a year for a copyright snipplet.instead of worked for me (shows current year and no more shows the error message).\n(Thanks to Chris above)@Justis pointed me to the right direction, but his code did not work for me. This did:Documentation: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-get.phpThis solution is not only for those who does not have full system access. It is necessary for any script when you provide it to anyone else but you. You never know on what server the script will run when you distribute it to someone else.If you are using codeigniter and can\'t change php.ini I added the following to the beginning of index.phpdate_default_timezone_set(\'GMT\');I always keep this line inside codeigniter\'s root index.php.So that my code works at any serverList of Supported Timezones hereI had to put it in double quotes.date_default_timezone_set("America/Los_Angeles"); // default time zoneThis issue has been bugging me for SOME time as im trying to inject a "createbucket.php" script into composer and i keep being told my time-zone is incorrect.In the end the only thing that fixed the issue was to:\n$ sudo nano /etc/php.iniSearch for timezoneEnsure you remove the ;Then finally And you\'ll be good to go :)A simple method for two time zone. A quick solution whilst your rectify the incompatibilities, is to disable error reporting in your index.php file:Insert the line below into your index.php below define( \xe2\x80\x98_JEXEC\xe2\x80\x99, 1 );In addition to setting the date.timezone=   as mentioned in several answers,\nI found an error in the php.ini file that was keeping it from getting to the date.timezone.\nThe way I found it was by running php from the command line in a terminal.\nthis caused an error to be reported at line 114.  In my case I had uncommented a setting for displaying errors that had \'|\'  between 2 values.  It did not like it.\nI removed one of the values and the |  and everything was good after thatI am hosting my EC2 and S3 bucket in us-west-2 (Oregon) region. When I was calling $s3client->listBuckets() to list existing buckets in my php, I was getting exception - "Uncaught exception \'Exception\' with message \'DateTime::__construct(): It is not safe to rely on the system\'s timezone settings...". \nI made below changes to make it work. Sharing these details in case someone is facing similar issue and any of above answers have not helped.After this I am able to list buckets successfully without any exception. Hope this helps.If you using Plesk, try it, First, Open PHP Settings, at the bottom of page, change date.timezone from DEFAULT to UTC. I had this error running php-fpm in a chroot jail.  I tried creating etc/php.ini and /usr/share/zoneinfo in the chroot directory, but it just didn\'t work.  I even tried strace-ing the php-fpm daemons to see what file they were missing - nothing jumped out.So in case Google brings you here because you get this error when using php-fpm configured for chroot, you can probably fix it by adding this line to /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf in the ENV section:A php-fpm restart is normally required for it to take effect.  Hope this helps somebody out there.In my particular case, I have PHP configured to use PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager). When executing phpinfo() from CLI I saw correct timezone that I had set in the php.ini, however it was still incorrect in the browser and causing my code to fail. I simply needed to restart the php-fpm service on the server.You may also need to restart the httpd service if you edited the php.iniThis answer above from CtrlX is the correct answer, but it may not work completely.\nI added this line to my php.ini file:but it did not remove the PHP error for all my files because some of my PHP scripts are in subfolders. So I had to edit .htaccess file to setup php.ini to be used recursively (in subfolders):where account_name is your cpanel account name and public_html is the folder your php.ini file is in.
