The logic in the change() event handler is not being run when the value is set by val(), but it does run when user selects a value with their mouse. Why is this?Because the change event requires an actual browser event initiated by the user instead of via javascript code.Do this instead:I believe you can manually trigger the change event with trigger():Though why it doesn\'t fire automatically, I have no idea.As far as I can read in API\'s. The event is only fired when the user clicks on an option.http://api.jquery.com/change/For select boxes, checkboxes, and\n  radio buttons, the event is fired\n  immediately when the user makes a\n  selection with the mouse, but for the\n  other element types the event is\n  deferred until the element loses\n  focus.Adding this piece of code after the val() seems to work:To make it easier add a custom function and call it when ever you want that changing the value also trigger changeand Or you can override the val function to always call the change when the val is calledSample at http://jsfiddle.net/r60bfkub/In case you don\'t want to mix up with default change event you can provide your custom eventto trigger the event on value set, you can doThis worked for my script. I have 3 combos & bind with chainSelect event, I need to pass 3 values by url & default select all drop down. I used this And the first event worked.I ran into the same issue while using CMB2 with Wordpress and wanted to hook into the change event of a file upload metabox.So in case you\'re not able to modify the code that invokes the change (in this case the CMB2 script), use the code below.\nThe trigger is being invoked AFTER the value is set, otherwise your change eventHandler will work, but the value will be the previous one, not the one being set.Here\'s the code i use:If you\'ve just added the select option to a form and you wish to trigger the change event, I\'ve found a setTimeout is required otherwise jQuery doesn\'t pick up the newly added select box:
