For documenting classes with roxygen(2), specifying a title and description/details appears to be the same as for functions, methods, data, etc. However, slots and inheritance are their own sort of animal. What is the best practice -- current or planned -- for documenting S4 classes in roxygen2?Due Diligence:I found mention of an @slot tag in early descriptions of roxygen. \nA 2008 R-forge mailing list post \nseems to indicate that this is dead, \nand there is no support for @slot in roxygen:Is this true of roxygen2? The previously-mentioned post suggests a user should instead make their own itemized list with LaTeX markup. E.g. a new S4 class that extends the "character" class would be coded and documented like this:However, although this works, this \\describe , \\item approach for documenting the slots seems inconsistent with the rest of roxygen(2), in that there are no @-delimited tags and slots could go undocumented with no objection from roxygenize(). It also says nothing about a consistent way to document inheritance of the class being defined. I imagine dependency still generally works fine (if a particular slot requires a non-base class from another package) using the @import tag. So, to summarize, what is the current best-practice for roxygen(2) slots?There seem to be three options to consider at the moment:I\'m borrowing/extending this question from a post I made to the roxygen2 development page on github.Updated answer for Roxygen2 5.0.1, current as of 6.0.1For S4, the best practice now is documenting using the @slot tag:On a sidenote, @exportClass is only necessary in some cases, the general way to export a function is using @export now. You also don\'t have to export a class, unless you want other packages to be able to extend the class.  See also http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html#exportsUpdated answer for Roygen2 3.0.0, current as of 5.0.1.For S4, the best practice is documentation in the form: This is consistent with the internal representation of slots as a list inside the object. As you point out, this syntax is different than other lines, and we may hope for a more robust solution in the future that incorporates knowledge of inheritance -- but today that does not exist.As pointed out by @Brian Diggs, this feature was pulled into 3.0.0, further discussion at https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen/pull/85The solution provided by Full Decent is OK if you go for documenting slots in the Rd files itself. When using roxygen2, you can use the tag @section to do basically the same with \\describe. An example:http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html#man-classesI have not tried it yet for RC, but it works for me for S4 now.It looks like S4 class slots are fully supported under Roxygen2 version 3.0+:http://blog.rstudio.org/2013/12/09/roxygen2-3-0-0/"document your S4 classes, S4 methods and RC classes with roxygen2 \xe2\x80\x93 you can safely remove workarounds that used @alias and @usage, and simply rely on roxygen2 to do the right thing."
