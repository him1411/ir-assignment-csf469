I want to do something simple and straightforward, like min(5,10), or Math.max(4,7).  Are there functions to this effect in Ruby?You can do or They come from the Enumerable module, so anything that includes Enumerable will have those methods available.EDIT@nicholasklick mentions another option, Enumerable#minmax, but this time returning an array of [min, max].It doesn\'t seem very interesting with only 2 values in the initial array, soYou can use or  It\'s a method for Arrays.All those results generate garbage in a zealous attempt to handle more than two arguments. I\'d be curious to see how they perform compared to good \'ol:which is by-the-way my official answer to your question. :)In addition to the provided answers, if you want to convert Enumerable#max into a max method that can call a variable number or arguments, like in some other programming languages, you could write:Output:This abuses the properties of the splat operator to create an array object containing all the arguments provided, or an empty array object if no arguments were provided. In the latter case, the method will return nil, since calling Enumerable#max on an empty array object returns nil.If you want to define this method on the Math module, this should do the trick:Note that Enumerable.max is, at least, two times slower compared to the ternary operator (?:). See Dave Morse\'s answer for a simpler and faster method.If you need to find the max/min of a hash, you can use #max_by or #min_by
