I want to have the ListItems to extend with their orange background the full width of the Listbox.Currently they are only as wide as the FirstName + LastName.I\'ve set every element I can to: HorizontalAlignment="Stretch".I want the background of the ListboxItems to expand as the user stretches the Listbox so I don\'t want to put in absolute values. What do I have to do so that the background color of the ListBoxItems fill the width of the ListBox?I\'m sure this is a duplicate, but I can\'t find a question with the same answer.Add HorizontalContentAlignment="Stretch" to your ListBox. That should do the trick. Just be careful with auto-complete because it is so easy to get HorizontalAlignment by mistake.I found another solution here, since I ran into both post...This is from the Myles answer:This worked for me.If your items are wider than the ListBox, the other answers here won\'t help: the items in the ItemTemplate remain wider than the ListBox.The fix that worked for me was to disable the horizontal scrollbar, which, apparently, also tells the container of all those items to remain only as wide as the list box.Hence the combined fix to get ListBox items that are as wide as the list box, whether they are smaller and need stretching, or wider and need wrapping, is as follows:(credits for the scroll bar idea)Since the border is used just for visual appearance, you could put it into the ListBoxItem\'s ControlTemplate and modify the properties there. In the ItemTemplate, you could place only the StackPanel and the TextBlock. In this way, the code also remains clean, as in the appearance of the control will be controlled via the ControlTemplate and the data to be shown will be controlled via the DataTemplate.The fix for me was to set property HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" on ItemsPresenter inside ScrollViewer..Hope this helps someone...I also had the same problem, as a quick workaround, I used blend to determine how much padding was being added. In my case it was 12, so I used a negative margin to get rid of it. Now everything can now be centered properly
