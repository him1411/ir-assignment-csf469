I would like to replace (or remove) a newline character in a TSQL-string. \nAny Ideas?The obvious just won\'t do it...Actually a new line in a SQL command or script string can be any of CR, LF or CR+LF.  To get them all, you need something like this:The Newline in T-SQL is represented by CHAR(13) & CHAR(10) (Carriage return + Line Feed). Accordingly, you can create a REPLACE statement with the text you want to replace the newline with.To do what most people would want, create a placeholder that isn\'t an actual line breaking character. Then you can actually combine the approaches for:This way you replace only once. The approach of:Works great if you just want to get rid of the CRLF characters, but if you want a placeholder, such as  or something, then the first approach is a little more accurate.I may be a year late to the party, but I work on queries & MS-SQL every day, and I got tired of the built-in functions LTRIM() & RTRIM() (and always having to call them together), and of not catching \'dirty\' data that had newlines at the end, so I decided it was high time to implement a better TRIM function.  I\'d welcome peer feedback!Disclaimer: this actually removes (replaces with a single whitespace) extended forms of whitespace (tab, line-feed, carriage-return, etc.), so it\'s been renamed as "CleanAndTrim" from my original answer.  The idea here is that your string doesn\'t need such extra special-whitespace characters inside it, and so if they don\'t occur at the head/tail, they should be replaced with a plain space.  If you purposefully stored such characters in your string (say, your column of data that you\'re about to run this on), DON\'T DO IT!  Improve this function or write your own that literally just removes those characters from the endpoints of the string, not from the \'body\'.Okay, now that the disclaimer is updated, here\'s the code.Cheers!Another Disclaimer: \nYour typical Windows line-break is CR+LF, so if your string contains those, you\'d end up replacing them with "double" spaces.UPDATE, 2016: \nA new version that gives you the option to replace those special-whitespace characters with other characters of your choice!  This also includes commentary and the work-around for the Windows CR+LF pairing, i.e. replaces that specific char-pair with a single substitution.If your column data type is \'text\' then you will get an error message as Msg 8116, Level 16, State 1, Line 2 Argument data type text is\n  invalid for argument 1 of replace function.In this case you need to cast the text as nvarchar and then replaceIf you have an issue where you only want to remove trailing characters, you can try this:This solved a problem I had with addresses where a procedure created a field with a fixed number of lines, even if those lines were empty. To save space in my SSRS report, I cut them down.If you have have open procedure with using sp_helptext then just copy all text in new sql query and press ctrl+h button use regular expression to replace and put ^\\n in find field replace with blank .\nfor more detail check image.enter image description here
