I have two files, file1 and file2. How do I append the contents of file2 to file1, without overwriting the current file1. How do I do this on Ubuntu Linux?You mean like this?cat file2 >> file1The >> operator appends the output to the named file or creates the named file if it does not exist.cat file1 file2 > file3This concatenates two or more files to one.  You can have as many source files as you need.  For example,cat *.txt >> newfile.txtUpdate 20130902\nIn the comments eumiro suggests "don\'t try cat file1 file2 > file1."  The reason this might not result in the expected outcome is that the file receiving the redirect is prepared before the command to the left of the > is executed.  In this case, first file1 is truncated to zero length and opened for output, then the cat command attempts to concatenate the now zero-length file plus the contents of file2 into file1.  The result is that the original contents of file1 are lost and in its place is a copy of file2 which probably isn\'t what was expected.Update 20160919\nIn the comments tpartee suggests linking to backing information/sources.  For an authoritative reference, I direct the kind reader to the sh man page at linuxcommand.org which states:Before a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected\n  using a special notation interpreted by the shell.While that does tell the reader what they need to know it is easy to miss if you aren\'t looking for it and parsing the statement word by word.  The most important word here being \'before\'.  The redirection is completed (or fails) before the command is executed.In the example case of cat file1 file2 > file1 the shell performs the redirection first so that the I/O handles are in place in the environment in which the command will be executed before it is executed.A friendlier version in which the redirection precedence is covered at length can be found at Ian Allen\'s web site in the form of Linux courseware.  His I/O Redirection Notes page has much to say on the topic, including the observation that redirection works even without a command.  Passing this to the shell:...creates an empty file named out.  The shell first sets up the I/O redirection, then looks for a command, finds none, and completes the operation.Note: if you need to use sudo, do this:sudo bash -c \'cat file2 >> file1\'The usual method of simply prepending sudo to the command will fail, since the privilege escalation doesn\'t carry over into the output redirection.Try this command:the command you seek isfile1 and file2 are 2 different files and they are appended to produce to third result file (file3).Just for reference, using ddrescue provides an interruptible way of achieving the task if, for example, you have large files and the need to pause and then carry on at some later point:The logfile is the important bit. You can interrupt the process with Ctrl-C and resume it by specifying the exact same command again and ddrescue will read logfile and resume from where it left off. The -o A flag tells ddrescue to start from byte A in the output file (file1). So wc --bytes file1 | awk \'{ print $1 }\' just extracts the size of file1 in bytes (you can just paste in the output from ls if you like).cat can be the easy solution but that become very slow when we concat large files, find -print is to rescue you, though you have to use cat once.
