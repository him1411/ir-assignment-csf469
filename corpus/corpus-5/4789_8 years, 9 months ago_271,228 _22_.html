I want to execute something in a linux shell under a few different conditions, and be able to output the execution time of each execution.I know I could write a perl or python script that would do this, but is there a way I can do it in the shell? (which happens to be bash)Use the built-in time keyword:Example:You can get much more detailed information than the bash built-in time (which Robert Gamble mentions) using time(1). Normally this is /usr/bin/time.Editor\'s note:\nTo ensure that you\'re invoking the external utility time rather than your shell\'s time keyword, invoke it as /usr/bin/time.\ntime is a POSIX-mandated utility, but the only option it is required to support is -p.\nSpecific platforms implement specific, nonstandard extensions: -v works with GNU\'s time utility, as demonstrated below (the question is tagged linux); the BSD/macOS implementation uses -l to produce similar output - see man 1 time.Example of verbose output:Should you want more precision, use %N with date (and use bc for the diff, because $(()) only handles integers).Here\'s how to do it:Example:Result:For a line-by-line delta measurement, try gnonom.A command line utility, a bit like moreutils\'s ts, to prepend timestamp information to the standard output of another command. Useful for long-running processes where you\'d like a historical record of what\'s taking so long.You can also use the --high and/or --medium options to specify a length threshold in seconds, over which gnomon will highlight the timestamp in red or yellow. And you can do a few other things, too.If you intend to use the times later to compute with, learn how to use the -f option of /usr/bin/time to output code that saves times.  Here\'s some code I used recently to get and sort the execution times of a whole classful of students\' programs:I later concatenated all the $timefile files and pipe the output into a Lua interpreter.  You can do the same with Python or bash or whatever your favorite syntax is.  I love this technique.You can use time and subshell ():Or in same shell {}:The way isoutput is >>If you only need precision to the second, you can use the builtin $SECONDS variable, which counts the number of seconds that the shell has been running.
