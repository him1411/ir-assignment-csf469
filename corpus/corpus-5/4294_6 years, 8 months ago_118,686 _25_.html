I found a blog post on alias vs. alias_method. As shown in the example given in that blog post, I simply want to alias a method to another within the same class. Which should I use? I always see alias used, but someone told me alias_method is better.Usage of aliasUsage of alias_methodBlog post link herealias_method can be redefined if need be. (it\'s defined in the Module class.)alias\'s behavior changes depending on its scope and can be quite unpredictable at times.Verdict: Use alias_method - it gives you a ton more flexibility.Usage:Apart from the syntax, the main difference is in the scoping:In the above case method \xe2\x80\x9cname\xe2\x80\x9d picks the method \xe2\x80\x9cfull_name\xe2\x80\x9d defined in \xe2\x80\x9cDeveloper\xe2\x80\x9d class. Now lets try with alias.With the usage of alias the method \xe2\x80\x9cname\xe2\x80\x9d is not able to pick the method \xe2\x80\x9cfull_name\xe2\x80\x9d defined in Developer.This is because alias is a keyword and it is lexically scoped. It means it treats self as the value of self at the time the source code was read . In contrast alias_method treats self as the value determined at the run time.Source: http://blog.bigbinary.com/2012/01/08/alias-vs-alias-method.htmlI think there is an unwritten rule (something like a convention) that says to use \'alias\' just for registering a method-name alias, means if you like to give the user of your code one method with more than one name:If you need to extend your code, use the ruby meta alternative.A point in favor of alias instead of alias_method is that its semantic is recognized by rdoc, leading to neat cross references in the generated documentation, while rdoc completely ignore alias_method.A year after asking the question comes a new article on the subject:http://erniemiller.org/2014/10/23/in-defense-of-alias/It seems that "so many men, so many minds." From the former article author encourages to use alias_method, while the latter suggests using alias.However there\'s a common overview of these methods in both blogposts and answers above:Although it may be minor, but there are two things I like about alias, more so than alias_method:(1) alias is shorterand(2) You dont have to type the ,This is little, I know, but when you do this a few hundred times as the years pass by, you simply tend to prefer alias whenever possible
