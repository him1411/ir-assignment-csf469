How should I go about renaming my current file in vim. For example: How would I go about doing this, elegantly? There\'s a little plugin that let\'s you do this.The command is called :saveas, but unfortunately it will not delete your old file, you\'ll have to do that manually. see :help saveas for more info.EDIT:Most vim installations have an integrated file explorer, which you can use for such operations. Try :Explore in command mode (I would actually map that to a function key, it\'s very handy). You can rename files with R or delete them with D, for example. But pressing <F1> in the explorer will give you a better overview.If you use git and already have the tpope\'s plugin fugitive.vim then simply:This will:If your file was not yet added to a git repo then first add it:On Windows, the optional 3rd step changes a little:I\'m doing it with NERDTree plugin:then press mAnd next you can choose between delete, copy, move, etc...I\'d recommend :Rename from tpope\'s eunuch for this.It also includes a bunch of other handy commands.The Rename command is defined as follows therein currently (check the repo for any updates!):You can also do it using netrwThe explore command opens up netrw in the directory of the open fileMove the cursor over the file you want to rename:Type in the new name, press enter, press y.If the file is already saved:Example:Permission Requirements:Save As:\nFor Windows Unverified There\xe2\x80\x99s a function in Gary Bernhardt\xe2\x80\x99s .vimrc that handles this.How about this (improved by Jake\'s suggestion):Vim does have a rename function, but unfortunately it does not retain the history.The easiest OS agnostic way to rename a file without losing the history would be:expand(\'#:p\') returns the full path of the older file.Use :bd # if you also want to delete the older file from the buffer list.If you want to use a quick command to rename the file, add a new file under ~/.vim/plugin with the following contents:The command Rename will help you to quickly rename a file.control + R, # will show what exactly we have to delete before wipeout the World...\nUsing pipe | in such a case is not secure, because if sav fails for any reason that alternate filename # not changes, !rm # or delete(expand(#)) will delete completly different file!\nSo. Do it by hand carefully or use good script (they are mentioned in many answers here). ...or try build a function/command/script yourself. Start from sth simple like:after vimrc reload, just type :Rename new_filename.\nWhat is the problem with this command?Security test 1: What does:Rename without argument?Yes, it deletes file hidden in \'#\' ! Solution: you can use eg. conditions or try statement like that:Security test 1:\n:Rename (without argument) will throw an error:E471: Argument requiredSecurity test 2:\nWhat if the name will be the same like previous one?Security test 3:\nWhat if the file will be in different location than your actual?Fix it yourself.\nFor readability you can write it in this manner:notes!rm # is better than !rm old_name -> you don\'t need remember the old name !rm <C-R># is better than !rm # when do it by hand -> you will see what you actually remove (safety reason)!rm is generally not very secure... mv to a trash location is bettercall delete(expand(\'#\')) is better than shell command (OS agnostic) but longer to type and impossible to use control + Rtry | code1 | code2 | tryend -> when error occurs while code1, don\'t run code2:saveas is equivalent to :f new_name | w - see file_fexpand(\'%:p\') gives whole path of your location (%) or location of alternate file (#)There\'s a sightly larger plugin called vim-eunuch by Tim Pope that includes a rename function as well as some other goodies (delete, find, save all, chmod, sudo edit, ...).To rename a file in vim-eunuch::Move filename.extCompared to rename.vim::rename[!] filename.extSaves a few keystrokes :)You can also use :f followed by :wI don\'t know if this is the "easiest" method, but assuming you\'ve already saved your file (:w) I would invoke the shell (:sh) and do a simple cp foo foo.bak  To go back to editor use Ctrl-D/Exit.\nUseful list of vi editor commands on this linkThis little script isn\'t perfect (the extra carriage-return you have to press) but it get\'s the job done.     Another way is to just use netrw, which is a native part of vim. Then there are options to delete, rename, etc.Here\'s a keymap to open netrw to the folder of the file you are editing::sav newfile | !rm #\nNote that it does not remove the old file from the buffer list. If that\'s important to you, you can use the following instead::sav newfile | bd# | !rm #\n
