Is there a function in C# to quickly convert some collection to string and separate values with delimiter?For example:List<string> names --> string names_together = "John, Anna, Monica"You can use String.Join.  If you have a List<string> then you can call ToArray first: In .NET 4 you don\'t need the ToArray anymore, since there is an overload of String.Join that takes an IEnumerable<string>.  You can also do this with linq if you\'d likeAlthough I prefer the non-linq syntax in Quartermeister\'s answer and I think Aggregate might perform slower (probably more string concatenation operations).
