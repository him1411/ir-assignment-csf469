How do I modify the owner of all tables in a PostgreSQL database?I tried ALTER TABLE * OWNER TO new_owner but it doesn\'t support the asterisk syntax.Note: As @trygvis mentions in the answer below, the REASSIGN OWNED command is available since at least version 8.2, and is a much easier method.Since you\'re changing the ownership for all tables, you likely want views and sequences too.  Here\'s what I did:Tables:Sequences:Views:You could probably DRY that up a bit since the alter statements are identical for all three.You can use the REASSIGN OWNED command.This changes all objects owned by old_role to the new role. You don\'t have to think about what kind of objects that the user has, they will all be changed. Note that it only applies to objects inside a single database. It does not alter the owner of the database itself either.It is available back to at least 8.2. Their online documentation only goes that far back.This: http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-bugs/2007-10/msg00234.php is also a nice and fast solution, and works for multiple schemas in one database:TablesSequencesViewsMaterialized ViewsBased on this answerThis generates all the required ALTER TABLE / ALTER SEQUENCE / ALTER VIEW statements, copy these and paste them back into plsql to run them.Check your work in psql by doing:If you want to do it in one sql statement, you need to define an exec() function as mentioned in http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Dynamic_DDLThen you can execute this query, it will change the owner of tables, sequences and views:$NEWUSER is the postgresql new name of the new owner.In most circumstances you need to be superuser to execute this. You can avoid that by changing the owner from your own user to a role group you are a member of.Thanks to RhodiumToad on #postgresql for helping out with this.I recently had to change the ownership of all objects in a database. Although tables, views, triggers and sequences were somewhat easily changed the above approach failed for functions as the signature is part of the function name. Granted, I have a MySQL background and am not that familiar with Postgres.However, pg_dump allows you to dump just the schema and this contains the ALTER xxx OWNER TO yyy; statements you need. Here is my bit of shell magic on the topicvery simple, try it...is very simpledone.You can try the following in PostgreSQL 9There is no such command in PostgreSQL. But you can work around it using method I described some time ago for GRANTs.I like this one since it modifies tables, views, sequences and functions owner of a certain schema in one go (in one sql statement), without creating a function and you can use it directly in PgAdmin III and psql:(Tested in PostgreSql v9.2)Based on answers provided by @rkj, @AlannaRose, @SharoonThomas, @user3560574 and this answer by @a_horse_with_no_nameThank\'s a lot.Better yet: Also change database and schema owner.Based on the answer by elysch, here is a solution for multiple schemas:The answer by @Alex Soto is the right one and the gist uploaded by @Yoav Aner also works provided there are no special characters in the table/view names (which are legal in postgres).You need to escape them to work and I have uploaded a gist for that: https://gist.github.com/2911117Starting in PostgreSQL 9.0, you have the ability to GRANT [priv name] ON ALL [object type]  IN SCHEMA where [priv name] is the typical SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc and [object type] can be one of:PostgreSQL\'s docs on GRANT and REVOKE go in to more detail regarding this. In some situations it\'s still required to use tricks involving the system catalogs (pg_catalog.pg_*) but it\'s not nearly as common. I frequently do the following:Then pipe the backup file back in to PostgreSQL using:As there is no owner included then all of the created table, schema, etc,  are created under the login user you specify.I have read this could be a good approach for migrating between PostgreSQL versions as well.The accepted solution does not take care of function ownership following solution takes care of everything (while reviewing I noticed that it is similar to @magiconair above) I\xe2\x80\x99ve created a convenient script for that; pg_change_db_owner.sh. This script change ownership for all tables, views, sequences and functions in a database schema and also owner of the schema itself.Please note that if you wanna just change the ownership of all objects, in a particular database,\nowned by a particular database role, then you can simply use command REASSIGN OWNED instead.The following simpler shell script worked for me.Where input  $1 - username (database) \n$2 = existing schema\n$3 = to new schema.Same as @AlexSoto\'s approach for functions:
