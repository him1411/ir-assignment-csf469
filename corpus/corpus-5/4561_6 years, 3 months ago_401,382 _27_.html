When using jquery .change on an input the event will only be fired when the input loses focusIn my case, I need to make a call to the service (check if value is valid) as soon as the input value is changed. How could I accomplish this?UPDATED for clarification and exampleexamples: http://jsfiddle.net/pxfunc/5kpeJ/Method 1. input eventIn modern browsers use the input event.  This event will fire when the user is typing into a text field, pasting, undoing, basically anytime the value changed from one value to another.In jQuery do that like thisstarting with jQuery 1.7, replace bind with on:Method 2. keyup eventFor older browsers use the keyup event (this will fire once a key on the keyboard has been released, this event can give a sort of false positive because when "w" is released the input value is changed and the keyup event fires, but also when the "shift" key is released the keyup event fires but no change has been made to the input.).  Also this method doesn\'t fire if the user right-clicks and pastes from the context menu:Method 3. Timer (setInterval or setTimeout)To get around the limitations of keyup you can set a timer to periodically check the value of the input to determine a change in value.  You can use setInterval or setTimeout to do this timer check.  See the marked answer on this SO question: jQuery textbox change event or see the fiddle for a working example using focus and blur events to start and stop the timer for a specific input fieldIf you\'ve got HTML5:Otherwise you need to check for all these events which might indicate a change to the input element\'s value:and maybe:With HTML5 and without using jQuery, you can using the input event:This will fire each time the input\'s text changes.Supported in IE9+ and other browsers.Try it live in a jsFiddle here.As others already suggested, the solution in your case is to sniff multiple events.\nPlugins doing this job often listen for the following events:If you think it may fit, you can add focus, blur and other events too.\nI suggest not to exceed in the events to listen, as it loads in the browser memory further procedures to execute according to the user\'s behaviour.Attention: note that changing the value of an input element with JavaScript (e.g. through the jQuery .val() method) won\'t fire any of the events above.\n(Reference: https://api.jquery.com/change/).If you want the event to be fired whenever something is changed within the element then you could use the keyup event.There are jQuery events like keyup and keypress which you can use with input HTML Elements.\nYou could additionally use the blur() event.This covers every change to an input using jQuery 1.7 and above:// .blur is triggered when element loses focus// To trigger manually use:
