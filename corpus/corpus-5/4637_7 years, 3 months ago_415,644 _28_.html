How can I send/post an xml file to a local server http://localhost:8080 using curl from the command line? What command should I use?If that question is connected to your other Hudson questions use the command they provide. You need to change it a little bit to read from a file:Read the manpage. following an abstract for -d Parameter.-d/--data (HTTP) Sends the specified data in a\n  POST request to the HTTP server, in\n  the same way that a browser does when\n  a user has filled in an HTML form and\n  presses the submit button. This will\n  cause curl to pass the data to the\n  server using the content-type\n  application/x-www-form-urlencoded.\n  Compare to -F/--form.-d/--data is the same as --data-ascii. To post data purely binary, you should\n  instead use the --data-binary option.\n  To URL-encode the value of a form\n  field you may use --data-urlencode.If any of these options is used more\n  than once on the same command line,\n  the data pieces specified will be\n  merged together with a separating\n  &-symbol. Thus, using \'-d name=daniel\n  -d skill=lousy\' would generate a post chunk that looks like\n  \'name=daniel&skill=lousy\'.If you start the data with the letter\n  @, the rest should be a file name to\n  read the data from, or - if you want\n  curl to read the data from stdin. The\n  contents of the file must already be\n  URL-encoded. Multiple files can also\n  be specified. Posting data from a file\n  named \'foobar\' would thus be done with\n  --data @foobar.From the manpage, I believe these are the droids you are looking for:-F/--form <name=content>(HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the Content-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC2388. This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the \'content\' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. Example, to send your password file to the server, where \'password\' is the name of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be the input: curl -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.comSo in your case, this would be something like\ncurl -F file=@/some/file/on/your/local/disk http://localhost:8080You can using option --data with file.Write xml content to a file named is soap_get.xml and using curl command to send request:curl -X POST --header "Content-Type:text/xml;charset=UTF-8" --data @soap_get.xml your_urlWith Jenkins 1.494, I was able to send a file to a job parameter on Ubuntu Linux 12.10 using curl with --form parameters:On the Jenkins server, I configured a job that accepts a single parameter: a file upload parameter named myfileparam.The first line of that curl call constructs a web form with a parameter named myfileparam (same as in the job); its value will be the contents of a file on the local file system named /local/path/to/your/file.txt. The @ symbol prefix tells curl to send a local file instead of the given filename.The second line defines a JSON request that matches the form parameters on line one: a file parameter named myfileparam.The third line activates the form\'s Build button. The forth line is the job URL with the "/build" suffix.If this call is successful, curl returns 0. If it is unsuccessful, the error or exception from the service is printed to the console. This answer takes a lot from an old blog post relating to Hudson, which I deconstructed and re-worked for my own needs.Here\'s how you can POST XML on Windows using curl command line on Windows. Better use batch/.cmd file for that:If you have multiple headers then you might want to use the following:If you are using curl on Windows:
