What is the difference between PDOStatement::bindParam() and PDOStatement::bindValue()?The answer is in the documentation for bindParam:Unlike PDOStatement::bindValue(), the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that PDOStatement::execute() is called. And executecall PDOStatement::bindParam() to bind PHP variables to the parameter markers: bound variables pass their value as input and receive the output value, if any, of their associated parameter markersFrom the manual entry for PDOStatement::bindParam:[With bindParam] Unlike PDOStatement::bindValue(), the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that PDOStatement::execute() is called.So, for example:or Here are some I can think about :support the invocation of stored\n  procedures that return data as output\n  parameters, and some also as\n  input/output parameters that both send\n  in data and are updated to receive it.With some DB engines, stored procedures can have parameters that can be used for both input (giving a value from PHP to the procedure) and ouput (returning a value from the stored proc to PHP) ; to bind those parameters, you\'ve got to use bindParam, and not bindValue.For the most common purpose, you should use bindValue.bindParam has two tricky or unexpected behaviors:Source: http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.bindparam.php#94711From Prepared statements and stored procedures Use bindParam to insert multiple rows with one time binding:The simplest way to put it (in terms of PHP):You don\'t have to struggle any longer, when there exists a way lilke this:
