What is the use of bind() in JavaScript?Bind creates a new function that will have this set to the first parameter passed to bind().Here\'s an example that shows how to use bind to pass a member method around that has the correct this:Which prints out:You can also add extra parameters after the 1st (this) parameter and bind will pass in those values to the original function. Any additional parameters you later pass to the bound function will be passed in after the bound parameters:Which prints out:Check out JavaScript Function bind for more info and interactive examples.bind allows-For example, you have a function to deduct monthly club feesNow you want to reuse this function for a different club member. Note that the monthly fee will vary from member to member. Let\'s imagine Rachel has a balance of 500, and a monthly membership fee of 90.Now, create a function that can be used again and again to deduct the fee from her account every monthNow, the same getMonthlyFee function could be used for another member with a different membership fee. For Example, Ross Geller has a 250 balance and a monthly fee of 25The simplest use of bind() is to make a function that, no matter\nhow it is called, is called with a particular this value.Please refer this link for more information https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bindFrom the MDN docs on Function.prototype.bind() :The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its\n  this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of\n  arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.So, what does that mean?!Well, let\'s take a function that looks like this :Now, let\'s take an object that looks like this :We can bind our function to our object like this :Now, we can run Obj.log anywhere in our code :This works, because we bound the value of this to our object Obj. Where it really gets interesting, is when you not only bind a value for this, but also for its argument prop :We can now do this :Unlike with Obj.log, we do not have to pass x or y, because we passed those values when we did our binding.I will explain bind theoretically as well as practicallybind in javascript is a method -- Function.prototype.bind . bind is a  method. It is called on function prototype. This method creates a function whose body is similar to the function on which it is called but the \'this\' refers to the first parameter passed to the bind method. Its syntax isExample:--The bind() method creates a new function instance whose this value is bound to the value that was passed into bind(). \nFor example: Here, a new function called objectSayColor() is created from sayColor() by calling bind() and passing in the object o. The objectSayColor() function has a this value equivalent to o, so calling the function, even as a global call, results in the string \xe2\x80\x9cblue\xe2\x80\x9d being displayed.Reference : Nicholas C. Zakas - PROFESSIONAL JAVASCRIPT\xc2\xae FOR WEB DEVELOPERSAs mentioned, Function.bind() lets you specify the context that the function will execute in (that is, it lets you pass in what object the this keyword will resolve to in the body of the function.A couple of analogous toolkit API methods that perform a similar service:jQuery.proxy()Dojo.hitch()The bind method creates a new function from another function with one or more arguments bound to specific values, including the implicit this argument. This is an example of partial application. Normally we supply a function with all of its arguments which yields a value. This is known as function application. We are applying the function to its arguments. Partial application is an example of a higher order function (HOF) because it yields a new function with a fewer number of argument. You can use bind to transform functions with multiple arguments into new functions.  In the most common use case, when called with one argument the bind method will create a new function that has the this value bound to a specific value. In effect this transforms an instance method to a static method. The following example shows how using binding of this can enable an object method to act as a callback that can easily update the state of an object.The bind function creates a new function with the same function body as the function it is calling .It is called with the this argument .why we use bind fun. : when every time  a new instance is created and we have to use first initial instance then we use bind fun.We can\'t override the bind fun.simply it stores the initial object of the class.setInterval(this.animate_to.bind(this), 1000/this.difference);
