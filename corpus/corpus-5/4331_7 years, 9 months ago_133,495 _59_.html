I submitted my app a little over a week ago and got the dreaded rejection email today. It tells me that my app cannot be accepted because I\'m using a non-public API; specifically, it says,The non-public API that is included in your application is firstResponder.Now, the offending API call is actually a solution I found here on SO:How do I get the current first responder on the screen? I\'m looking for a way that won\'t get my app rejected.In one of my applications I often want the first responder to resign if the user taps on the background. For this purpose I wrote a category on UIView, which I call on the UIWindow.The following is based on that and should return the first responder.iOS 7+ If your ultimate aim is just to resign the first responder, this should work: [self.view endEditing:YES]A common way of manipulating the first responder is to use nil targeted actions. This is a way of sending an arbitrary message to the responder chain (starting with the first responder), and continuing down the chain until someone responds to the message (has implemented a method matching the selector).For the case of dismissing the keyboard, this is the most effective way that will work no matter which window or view is first responder:This should be more effective than even [self.view.window endEditing:YES].(Thanks to BigZaphod for reminding me of the concept)Here\'s a category that allows you to quickly find the first responder by calling [UIResponder currentFirstResponder]. Just add the following two files to your project:UIResponder+FirstResponder.hUIResponder+FirstResponder.mThe trick here is that sending an action to nil sends it to the first responder.(I originally published this answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14135456/322427)It\'s not pretty, but the way I resign the firstResponder when I don\'t know what that the responder is:Create an UITextField, either in IB or programmatically. Make it Hidden. Link it up to your code if you made it in IB.Then, when you want to dismiss the keyboard, you switch the responder to the invisible text field, and immediately resign it:Here is a Extension implemented in Swift based on Jakob Egger\'s most excellent answer:Here\'s a solution which reports the correct first responder (many other solutions won\'t report a UIViewController as the first responder, for example), doesn\'t require looping over the view hierarchy, and doesn\'t use private APIs.It leverages Apple\'s method sendAction:to:from:forEvent:, which already knows how to access the first responder.We just need to tweak it in 2 ways:Here is the code:The first responder can be any instance of the class UIResponder, so there are other classes that might be the first responder despite the UIViews. For example UIViewController might also be the first responder. In this gist you will find a recursive way to get the first responder by looping through the hierarchy of controllers starting from the rootViewController of the application\'s windows.You can retrieve then the first responder by doingHowever, if the first responder is not a subclass of UIView or UIViewController, this approach will fail.To fix this problem we can do a different approach by creating a category on UIResponder and perform some magic swizzeling to be able to build an array of all living instances of this class. Then, to get the first responder we can simple iterate and ask each object if -isFirstResponder.This approach can be found implemented in this other gist.Hope it helps.For a Swift 3 version of nevyn\'s answer:Iterate over the views that could be the first responder and use - (BOOL)isFirstResponder to determine if they currently are.Using Swift and with a specific UIView object this might help:Just place it in your UIViewController and use it like this:Take note that the result is an Optional value so it will be nil in case no firstResponser was found in the given views subviews.If you just need to kill the keyboard when the user taps on a background area why not add a gesture recognizer and use it to send the [[self view] endEditing:YES] message?you can add the Tap gesture recogniser in the xib or storyboard file and connect it to an action,looks something like this then finishedThis is what I did to find what UITextField is the firstResponder when the user clicks Save/Cancel in a ModalViewController: Peter Steinberger just tweeted about the private notification UIWindowFirstResponderDidChangeNotification, which you can observe if you want to watch the firstResponder change.Just it case here is Swift version of awesome Jakob Egger\'s approach:This is what I have in my UIViewController Category.  Useful for many things, including getting first responder. Blocks are great!With a category on UIResponder, it is possible to legally ask the UIApplication object to tell you who the first responder is.See this:Is there any way of asking an iOS view which of its children has first responder status?you can call privite api like this ,apple ignore:You can try also like this:I didn\'t try it but it seems a good solutionThe solution from romeo https://stackoverflow.com/a/2799675/661022 is cool, but I noticed that the code needs one more loop. I was working with tableViewController.\nI edited the script and then I checked. Everything worked perfect.I recommed to try this:This is good candidate for recursion! No need to add a category to UIView.Usage (from your view controller):Code:I would like to shared with you my implementation for find first responder in anywhere of UIView. I hope it helps and sorry for my english. Thanks}Swift version of @thomas-m\xc3\xbcller\'s responseCode below work.
