I need to reverse my NSArray.As an example:[1,2,3,4,5] must become: [5,4,3,2,1]What is the best way to achieve this?For obtaining a reversed copy of an array, look at danielpunkass\' solution using reverseObjectEnumerator.For reversing a mutable array, you can add the following category to your code:There is a much easier solution, if you take advantage of the built-in reverseObjectEnumerator method on NSArray, and the allObjects method of NSEnumerator:allObjects is documented as returning an array with the objects that have not yet been traversed with nextObject, in order:This array contains all the remaining objects of the enumerator in enumerated order.Some benchmarks1. reverseObjectEnumerator allObjectsThis is the fastest method:Result: executionTime = 0.0000262. Iterating over an reverseObjectEnumeratorThis is between 1.5x and 2.5x slower:Result: executionTime = 0.0000713. sortedArrayUsingComparatorThis is between 30x and 40x slower (no surprises here):Result: executionTime = 0.001100So [[anArray reverseObjectEnumerator] allObjects] is the clear winner when it comes to speed and ease.DasBoot has the right approach, but there are a few mistakes in his code.  Here\'s a completely generic code snippet that will reverse any NSMutableArray in place:You can wrap that in a C function, or for bonus points, use categories to add it to NSMutableArray.  (In that case, \'array\' would become \'self\'.) You can also optimize it by assigning [array count] to a variable before the loop and using that variable, if you desire.If you only have a regular NSArray, there\'s no way to reverse it in place, because NSArrays cannot be modified.  But you can make a reversed copy:Or use this little trick to do it in one line:If you just want to loop over an array backwards, you can use a for/in loop with [array reverseObjectEnumerator], but it\'s likely a bit more efficient to use -enumerateObjectsWithOptions:usingBlock::(Note: Substantially updated in 2014 with five more years of Foundation experience, a new Objective-C feature or two, and a couple tips from the comments.)After reviewing the other\'s answers above and finding Matt Gallagher\'s discussion hereI propose this:As Matt observes:In the above case, you may wonder if -[NSArray reverseObjectEnumerator] would be run on every iteration of the loop \xe2\x80\x94 potentially slowing down the code. <...>Shortly thereafter, he answers thus:<...> The "collection" expression is only evaluated once, when the for loop begins. This is the best case, since you can safely put an expensive function in the "collection" expression without impacting upon the per-iteration performance of the loop.Georg Sch\xc3\xb6lly\'s categories are very nice. However, for NSMutableArray, using NSUIntegers for the indices results in a crash when the array is empty. The correct code is:Use enumerateObjectsWithOptions:NSEnumerationReverse usingBlock. Using @JohannesFahrenkrug\'s benchmark above, this completed 8x quicker than [[array reverseObjectEnumerator] allObjects];:Reverse array and looping through it:To update this, in Swift it can be done easily with:As for me, have you considered how the array was populated in the first place? I was in the process of adding MANY objects to an array, and decided to insert each one at the beginning, pushing any existing objects up by one. Requires a mutable array, in this case.Or the Scala-way:I don\'t know of any built in method.\nBut, coding by hand is not too difficult. Assuming the elements of the array you are dealing with are NSNumber objects of integer type, and \'arr\' is the NSMutableArray that you want to reverse.Since you start with a NSArray then you have to create the mutable array first with the contents of the original NSArray (\'origArray\').Edit: Fixed n -> n/2 in the loop count and changed NSNumber to the more generic id due to the suggestions in Brent\'s answer.If all you want to do is iterate in reverse, try this:You can do the [myArrayCount] once and save it to a local variable (I think its expensive), but I\xe2\x80\x99m also guessing that the compiler will pretty much do the same thing with the code as written above.Swift 3 syntax :Try this:
