I\'ve been trying to start a service when a device boots up on android, but I cannot get it to work. I\'ve looked at a number of links online but none of the code works. Am I forgetting something? Thanks The other answers look good, but I thought I\'d wrap everything up into one complete answer.You need the following in your AndroidManifest.xml file:In your <manifest> element:In your <application> element (be sure to use a fully-qualified [or relative] class name for your BroadcastReceiver):(you don\'t need the android:enabled, exported, etc., attributes: the Android defaults are correct)In MyBroadcastReceiver.java:From the original question:As an additional info: BOOT_COMPLETE is sent to applications before external storage is mounted. So if application is installed to external storage it won\'t receive BOOT_COMPLETE broadcast message.More details here in section Broadcast Receivers listening for "boot completed"How to start service on device boot(autorun app, etc.)For first: since version Android 3.1+ you don\'t receive BOOT_COMPLETE if user never started your app at least once or user "force closed" application.\nThis was done to prevent malware automatically register service. This security hole was closed in newer versions of Android.Solution:Create app with activity. When user run it once app can receive BOOT_COMPLETE broadcast message.For second: BOOT_COMPLETE is sent before external storage is mounted. If app is installed to external storage it won\'t receive BOOT_COMPLETE broadcast message.In this case there is two solution:If your app already installed in internal storage then code below can help you understand how to start service on device boot.In Manifest.xmlPermission:Register your BOOT_COMPLETED receiver:Register your service:In receiver OnBoot.java:For HTC you maybe need also add in Manifest this code if device don\'t catch RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED:Receiver now look like this:How to test BOOT_COMPLETED without restart emulator or real device?\nIt\'s easy. Try this:How to get device id? Get list of connected devices with id\'s:adb in ADT by default you can find in:Enjoy! )Along withalso use,HTC devices dont seem to catch BOOT_COMPLETEDnote that at the beginning of the question, there is a typo mistake:<action android:name="android.intent.action._BOOT_COMPLETED"/>instead of :<action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"/>one small "_" and all this trouble :)I found out just now that it might be because of Fast Boot option in Settings > PowerWhen I have this option off, my application receives a this broadcast but not otherwise.By the way, I have Android 2.3.3 on HTC Incredible S.Hope it helps.I think your manifest needs to add: I have an additional <category>-tag, don\'t know if that makes any difference.Have you tried ommiting the if-clause "android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED".equals(intent.getAction(), as the receiver probably only receives that intent anyway?Refer This Link http://khurramitdeveloper.blogspot.in/2013/06/start-activity-or-service-on-boot.html\nStep by Step procedure to use boot on ServiceAfter trying all of mentioned answers and tricks, I finally find why the code is not work in my phone. Some Android phones like "Huawei Honor 3C Android  4.2.2" have a Statup Manager menu in their settings and your app must be checked in the list. \n:)Before mounting external storage BOOT_COMPLETE is sent execute.if your app is installed to external storage it won\'t receive BOOT_COMPLETE broadcast message. To prevent this you can install your application in internal storage. you can do this just adding this line in menifest.xmlSome HTC devices can enable a "fast boot" feature that is more like a deep hibernation and not a real reboot and therefore should not give the BOOT_COMPLETE intent. To recover this you can add this intent filter inside your receiver:If you\'re using Android Studio and you\'re very fond of auto-complete then I must inform you, I\'m using Android Studio v 1.1.0 and I used auto-complete for the following permissionAnd Android Studio Auto-completedRECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED all in lower-case like receive_boot_completed and I kept pulling my hair out because I\'d already ticked out my checklist for things to do to start service at boot. I just confirmed againAndroid Studio DOES auto-complete this permission in lower-case.In fact,I get into this trouble not long ago,and it\'s really really easy to fix,you actually do nothing wrong if you setup the "android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" permission and intent-filter.Be attention that if you On Android 4.X,you have to run the broadcast listener before you start service on boot,that means,you have to add an activity first,once your broadcast receiver running,your app should function as you expected,however,on Android 4.X,I haven\'t found a way to start the service on boot without any activity,I think google did that for security reasons.As @Damian commented, all the answers in this thread are doing it wrong. Doing it manually like this runs the risk of your Service being stopped in the middle from the device going to sleep. You need to obtain a wake lock first. Luckily, the Support library gives us a class to do this:then, in your Service, make sure to release the wake lock:Don\'t forget to add the WAKE_LOCK permssion to your mainfest:I faced with this problem if i leave the empty constructor in the  receiver class. After the removing the empty contsructor onRreceive methos started working fine.
