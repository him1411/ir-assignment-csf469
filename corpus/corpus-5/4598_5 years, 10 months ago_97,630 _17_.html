What\'s the difference between a Python module and a Python package?See also: What's the difference between "package" and "module" (for other languages)A module is a single file (or files) that are imported under one import and used. \ne.g.A package is a collection of modules in directories that give a package hierarchy.Documentation for modulesIntroduction to packagesAny Python file is a module, its name being the file\'s base name without the .py extension. A package is a collection of Python modules: while a module is a single Python file, a package is a directory of Python modules containing an additional __init__.py file, to distinguish a package from a directory that just happens to contain a bunch of Python scripts. Packages can be nested to any depth, provided that the corresponding directories contain their own __init__.py file.The distinction between module and package seems to hold just at the file system level. When you import a module or a package, the corresponding object created by Python is always of type module. Note, however, when you import a package, only variables/functions/classes in the __init__.py file of that package are directly visible, not sub-packages or modules. As an example, consider the xml package in the Python standard library: its xml directory contains an __init__.py file and four sub-directories; the sub-directory etree contains an __init__.py file and, among others, an ElementTree.py file. See what happens when you try to interactively import package/modules:In Python there also are built-in modules, such as sys, that are written in C, but I don\'t think you meant to consider those in your question.From the Python docs (here): It\xe2\x80\x99s important to keep in mind that all packages are modules, but not all modules are packages. Or put another way, packages are just a special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains a __path__ attribute is considered a package. For the package term definition see here.Python files with a dash in the name, like my-file.py, cannot be imported with a simple import statement. Code-wise, import my-file is the same as import my - file which will raise an exception. Such files are better characterized as scripts whereas importable files are modules. A late answer, yet another definition:A package is represented by an imported top-entity which could either be a self-contained module, or the \'__init__.py\' special module as the top-entity from a set of modules within a sub directory structure.So physically a package is a distribution unit, which provides one or more modules.So you remember back on your text books where on the content page the chapters were divided in modules.\nSo there lies the concept different chapters which have the same objective or the part of same theory then these parts are clustered together and know as module.\nSimilarly, in programming, when different functions are clustered together they are seperated and named as module.
