I want to use AngularJS with Django however they both use {{ }} as their template tags.  Is there an easy way to change one of the two to use some other custom templating tag?For Angular 1.0 you should use the $interpolateProvider apis to configure the interpolation symbols: http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$interpolateProvider.Something like this should do the trick:Keep in mind two things:While there is nothing we can do about the first issue, except for warning people, we do need to address the second issue.you can maybe try verbatim Django template tag \nand use it like this :If you did separate sections of page properly then you can easily use angularjs tags in "raw" tag scope.In jinja2In Django template (above 1.5)We created a very simple filter in Django \'ng\' that makes it easy to mix the two:foo.html:The ng filter looks like this:So I got some great help in the Angular IRC channel today.  It turns out you can change Angular\'s template tags very easily.  The necessary snippets below should be included after your angular include (the given example appears on their mailing lists and would use (()) as the new template tags, substitute for your own):Also, I was pointed to an upcoming enhancement that will expose startSymbol and endSymbol properties that can be set to whatever tags you desire.I vote against using double parentheses (()) as template tag. It may work well as long as no function call is involved but when tried the followingwith Firefox (10.0.2) on Mac I got a terribly long error instead of the intended logic. <[]> went well for me, at least up until now.Edit 2012-03-29:\nPlease note that $invalidWidgets is deprecated. However I\'d still use another wrapper than double braces. For any angular version higher than 0.10.7 (I guess) you could change the wrapper a lot easier in your app / module definition:API docs.I found the code below helpful. I found the code here: http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2787/You could always use ng-bind instead of {{ }} \nhttp://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngBindIf you use django 1.5 and newer use:If you are stuck with django 1.2 on appengine extend the django syntax with the verbatim template command like this ...In your file use:Source:\nhttp://bamboobig.blogspot.co.at/2011/09/notebook-using-jquery-templates-in.htmlFor AngularJS v1.3.3 you should define your own template tags like thisAngularJS moduleWebpageYou can tell Django to output {{ and }}, as well as other reserved template strings by using the {% templatetag %} tag.For instance, using {% templatetag openvariable %} would output {{.I would stick with a solution that uses both django tags {{}} as well angularjs {{}} with a either a verbatim section or templatetag. That is simply because you can change the way angularjs works (as mentioned) via the $interpolateProvider.startSymbol $interpolateProvider.endSymbol but if you start to use other angularjs components like the ui-bootstrap you will find that some of the templates are ALREADY built with standard angularjs tags {{ }}. For example look at https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/blob/master/template/dialog/message.html. If you do any server-side interpolation, the only correct way to do this is with <>Anything else is an XSS vector.This is because any Angular delimiters which are not escaped by Django can be entered by the user into the interpolated string; if someone sets their username as "{{evil_code}}", Angular will happily run it. If you use a character than Django escapes, however, this won\'t happen.
