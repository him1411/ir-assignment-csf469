I would like to make a column unique in Ruby on Rails migration script. What is the best way to do it? Also is there a way to index a column in a table?I would like to enforce unique columns in a database as opposed to just using :validate_uniqueness_of.The short answer:To index multiple columns together, you pass an array of column names instead of a single column name,For finer grained control, there\'s a "execute" method that executes straight SQL.That\'s it!If you are doing this as a replacement for regular old model validations, just check to see how it works. I\'m not sure the error reporting to the user will be as nice. You can always do both. rails generate migration add_index_to_table_name column_name:uniqorrails generate migration add_column_name_to_table_name column_name:string:uniq:indexgeneratesIf you\'re adding an index to an existing column, remove or comment the add_column line, or put in a checkSince this hasn\'t been mentioned yet but answers the question I had when I found this page, you can also specify that an index should be unique when adding it via t.references or t.belongs_to:(as of at least Rails 4.2.7)I\'m using Rails 5 and the above answers work great; here\'s another way that also worked for me (the table name is :people and the column name is :email_address)To index multiple columns together, you pass an array of column names instead of a single column name.You might want to add name for the unique key as many times the default unique_key name by rails can be too long for which the DB can throw the error.To add name for your index just use the name: option.\nThe migration query might look something like this -add_index :table_name, [:column_name_a, :column_name_b, ... :column_name_n], unique: true, name: \'my_custom_index_name\'More info - http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements/add_index
