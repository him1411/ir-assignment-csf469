I have seen many projects using simplejson module instead of json module from the Standard Library. Also, there are many different simplejson modules. Why would use these alternatives, instead of the one in the Standard Library?json is simplejson, added to the stdlib. But since json was added in 2.6, simplejson has the advantage of working on more Python versions (2.4+). simplejson is also updated more frequently than Python, so if you need (or want) the latest version, it\'s best to use simplejson itself, if possible.A good practice, in my opinion, is to use one or the other as a fallback.I have to disagree with the other answers: the built in json library (in Python 2.7) is not necessarily slower than simplejson. It also doesn\'t have this annoying unicode bug.Here is a simple benchmark:And the results on my system (Python 2.7.4, Linux 64-bit):Complex real world data:\n        json dumps 1.56666707993 seconds\n  simplejson dumps 2.25638604164 seconds\n        json loads 2.71256899834 seconds\n  simplejson loads 1.29233884811 seconds  Simple data:\n        json dumps 0.370109081268 seconds\n  simplejson dumps 0.574181079865 seconds\n        json loads 0.422876119614 seconds\n  simplejson loads 0.270955085754 seconds  For dumping, json is faster than simplejson.\nFor loading, simplejson is faster.Since I am currently building a web service, dumps() is more important\xe2\x80\x94and using a standard library is always preferred.Also, cjson was not updated in the past 4 years, so I wouldn\'t touch it.I\'ve been benchmarking json, simplejson and cjson.http://pastie.org/1507411:All of these answers aren\'t very helpful because they are time sensitive. After doing some research of my own I found that simplejson is indeed faster than the builtin, if you keep it updated to the latest version.pip/easy_install wanted to install 2.3.2 on ubuntu 12.04, but after finding out the latest simplejson version is actually 3.3.0, so I updated it and reran the time tests. The above statements are in python-2.7.3 and simplejson 3.3.0 (with c speedups)\nAnd to make sure my answer also isn\'t time sensitive, you should run your own tests to check since it varies so much between versions; there\'s no easy answer that isn\'t time sensitive.UPDATE: I recently came across a library called ujson that is performing ~3x faster than simplejson with some basic tests. An API incompatibility I found, with Python 2.7 vs simplejson 3.3.1 is in whether output produces str or unicode objects.\ne.g.vsIf the preference is to use simplejson, then this can be addressed by coercing the argument string to unicode, as in:The coercion does require knowing the original charset, for example:This is the won\'t fix issue 40The builtin json module got included in Python 2.6.  Any projects that support versions of Python < 2.6 need to have a fallback.  In many cases, that fallback is simplejson.Another reason projects use simplejson is that the builtin json did not originally include its C speedups, so the performance difference was noticeable.Here\'s (a now outdated) comparison of Python json libraries:Comparing JSON modules for Python (archive link)Regardless of the results in this comparison you should use the standard library json if you are on Python 2.6.  And.. might as well just use simplejson otherwise.simplejson module is simply 1,5 times faster than json (On my computer, with simplejson 2.1.1 and Python 2.7 x86).If you want, you can try the benchmark: http://abral.altervista.org/jsonpickle-bench.zip\nOn my PC simplejson is faster than cPickle. I would like to know also your benchmarks!Probably, as said Coady, the difference between simplejson and json is that simplejson includes _speedups.c.\nSo, why don\'t python developers use simplejson?Some values are serialized differently between simplejson and json.Notably, instances of collections.namedtuple are serialized as arrays by json but as objects by simplejson. You can override this behaviour by passing namedtuple_as_object=False to simplejson.dump, but by default the behaviours do not match.I came across this question as I was looking to install simplejson for Python 2.6. I needed to use the \'object_pairs_hook\' of json.load() in order to load a json file as an OrderedDict. Being familiar with more recent versions of Python I didn\'t realize that the json module for Python 2.6 doesn\'t include the \'object_pairs_hook\' so I had to install simplejson for this purpose. From personal experience this is why i use simplejson as opposed to the standard json module.In python3, if you a string of b\'bytes\',  with json you have to .decode() the content before you can load it.  simplejson takes care of this so you can just do simplejson.loads(byte_string).
