How can I format an inline code in Confluence like this? I mean, not a separate code block, but just inline classname, for example.To insert inline monospace font in Confluence, surround the text in double curly-braces.This is an {{example}}.If you\'re using Confluence 4.x or higher, you can also just select the "Preformatted" option from the paragraph style menu.Full reference here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Quick+Reference+Guide+for+the+Confluence+EditorBy default Confluence renders monospaced text with transparent background. You can edit global CSS to add grey color. From Confluence manual:Custom CSS for displaying grey background in monospaced blocks:If you\'re using Confluence OnDemand (cloud):Paste the following:After that you\'ll get nice and tidy stackoverflow-stylish inline code spans just by writing {{sometext}}.You could ask your fiendly Confluence administrator to create a macro for you. Here is an example of a macro for Confluence 3.xThen users can use {inlinecode}like this{inlinecode}You could also use the {html} or {style} macros if they are installed or add this style to the stylesheet for your space.While you are at it ask your Confluence admin to create a kbd macro for you. Same as the above, except Macro name is kbd and Template is:Then you can write documentation to tell users to hit the F1 and Enter keys.
