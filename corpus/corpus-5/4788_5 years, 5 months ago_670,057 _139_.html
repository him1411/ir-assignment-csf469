First let me mention that I\'ve gone through many suggested questions and found no relevent answer. Here is what I\'m doing.I\'m connected to my Amazon EC2 instance. I can login with MySQL root with this command:Then I created a new user bill with host % Granted all the privileges to user bill:Then I exit from root user and try to login with bill:entered the correct password and got this error:ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user \'bill\'@\'localhost\' (using password: YES)You probably have an anonymous user \'\'@\'localhost\' or \'\'@\'127.0.0.1\'.As per the manual:When multiple matches are possible, the server must determine which of\n  them to use. It resolves this issue as follows: (...)(...)\n  The server uses sorting rules that order rows with the most-specific Host values first.\n  Literal host names [such as \'localhost\'] and IP addresses are the most specific.Hence, such an anonymous user would "mask" any other user like \'[any_username]\'@\'%\' when connecting from localhost.\'bill\'@\'localhost\' does match \'bill\'@\'%\', but would match (e.g.) \'\'@\'localhost\' beforehands.The recommended solution is to drop this anonymous user (this is usually a good thing to do anyways).Below edits are mostly irrelevant to the main question. These are only meant to answer some questions raised in other comments within this thread.Edit 1Authenticating as \'bill\'@\'%\' through a socket.Edit 2Exact same setup, except I re-activated networking, and I now create an anonymous  user \'\'@\'localhost\'.Edit 3Same situation as in edit 2, now providing the anonymous user\'s password.Conclusion 1, from edit 1: One can authenticate as \'bill\'@\'%\'through a socket.Conclusion 2, from edit 2: Whether one connects through TCP or through a socket has no impact on the authentication process (except one cannot connect as anyone else but \'something\'@\'localhost\' through a socket, obviously).Conclusion 3, from edit 3: Although I specified -ubill, I have been granted access as an anonymous user. This is because of the "sorting rules" advised above. Notice that in most default installations, a no-password, anonymous user exists (and should be secured/removed).Try:When you ran and got this errormysqld is expecting you to connect as bill@localhostTry creating bill@localhostIf you want to connect remotely, you must specify either the DNS name, the public IP, or 127.0.0.1 using TCP/IP:Once you login, please run thisUSER() reports how you attempted to authenticate in MySQLCURRENT_USER() reports how you were allowed to authenticate in MySQL from the mysql.user tableThis will give you a better view of how and why you were allowed to login to mysql. Why is this view important to know? It has to do with the user authentication ordering protocol.Here is an example: I will create an anonymous user on my desktop MySQL OK watch me login as anonymous user:Authentication ordering is very strict. It checks from the most specific to the least. I wrote about this authentiation style in the DBA StackExchange.Don\'t forget to explicitly call for TCP as the protocol for mysql client when necessary.When you type mysql -u root -p , you\'re connecting to the mysql server over a local unix socket. However the grant you gave, \'bill\'@\'%\' only matches TCP/IP connections curiously enough.If you want to grant access to the local unix socket, you need to grant privileges to \'bill\'@\'localhost\' , which curiously enough is not the same as \'bill\'@\'127.0.0.1\'You could also connect using TCP/IP with the mysql command line client, as to match the privileges you already granted, e.g. run mysql -u root -p -h 192.168.1.123 or whichever local IP address your box have.The solution is to  delete the anonymous (Any) user!I also faced the same issue on a server setup by someone else. I normally don\'t choose to create an anonymous user upon installing MySQL, so hadn\'t noticed this. Initially I logged in as "root" user and created a couple of "normal" users (aka users with privileges only on dbs with their username as prefix), then logged out, then went on to verify the first normal user. I couldn\'t log in. Neither via phpMyAdmin, nor via shell. Turns out, the culprit is this "Any" user.A related problem in my case was trying to connect using :Whitespace IS apparently allowed between the -u #uname# but NOT between the -p and #password#Therefore needed:Otherwise with white-space between -p mypass mysql takes \'mypass\' as the db nameSave yourself of a MAJOR headache... Your problem might be that you are missing the quotes around the password. At least that was my case that detoured me for 3 hours.http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/option-files.htmlSearch for "Here is a typical user option file:" and see the example they state in there. Good luck, and I hope to save someone else some time.If you forget your password or you want to modify your password.You can follow these steps :1 :stop your mysql[root@maomao ~]# service mysqld stop\n    Stopping MySQL:                                            [  OK  ]2 :use  \xe2\x80\x9c--skip-grant-tables\xe2\x80\x9d to restart mysql[root@mcy400 ~]# mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables \n    [root@cy400 ~]# Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql3 : open a new window and input mysql -u root[root@cy400 ~]# mysql -u root \n    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.

Once I did that it worked. Hope this helps someone. The best solution i found for myself is.my user is sonar and whenever i am trying to connect to my database from external or other machine i am getting error as Also as i am trying this from another machine and through Jenkins job my URL for accessing is if you want to connect remotely you can specify it with different ways as follows:To access this with URL you just have to execute the following query.Okay, I\'m not sure but probably this is my.cnf file inside mysql installation directory is the culprit.\nComment out this line and the problem might be resolved.Re: mySQL ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user \'root\'@\'localhostI hope you have not done more damage by also deleting the debian-sys-maint user in mysql Have your mysql daemon running the normal way. Start your mysql client as shown belowIn another terminal, \'cat\' the file /etc/mysql/debian.cnf. That file contains a password; paste that password when prompted for it.http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1836919Good luck.Just wanted to let you know a unusual circumstance I received the same error. Perhaps this helps someone in the future.I had developed a few base views, created at the development site and transferred them to the production-site. Later that week I changed a PHP script and all of a sudden errors came up that Access was denied for user \'local-web-user\'@\'localhost\'. The datasource object had not changed, so I concentrated on the database user in MySQL, worrying  in the meantime someone hacked my website. Luckily the rest of the site seemed unharmed.It later turned out that the views were the culprit(s). Our object transfers are done using another (and remote: admin@ip-address) user than the local website user. So the views were created with \'admin\'@\'ip-address\' as the definer. The view creation SECURITY default is When local-web-user tries to use the view it stumbles on the lacking privileges of the definer to use the tables. Once security was changed to: the issue was resolved. The actual problem was completely different than anticipated based on the error message.It\'s a difference between:and Check it:The command access implicit to \'bill\'@\'localhost\' and NOT to \'bill\'@\'%\'.There are no permissions for \'bill\'@\'localhost\'you get the error:solving the problem:This also happens when your password contains some special characters like @,$,etc.\nTo avoid this situation you can wrap password in single quotes:Or instead don\'t use password while entering. Leave it blank and then type it when terminal asks. This is the recommended way.For me, this problem was caused by a new feature of MySQL 5.7.2: user entries are ignored if their plugin field is empty.Set it to e.g. mysql_native_password to reenable them:See the release notes for MySQL 5.7.2, under \xc2\xabAuthentication Notes\xc2\xbb.For some reason (maybe because my pre-4.1 password hashes were removed), the mysql_upgrade script didn\'t set a default plugin value.I found out by noticing the following warning message in /var/log/mysql/error.log:[Warning] User entry \'foo\'@\'%\' has an empty plugin value. The user will  be ignored and no one can login with this user anymore.I post this answer here to maybe save someone from using the same ridiculous amount of time on this as I did.I resolved this by deleting the old buggy user \'bill\' entries (this is the important part: both from mysql.user and mysql.db), then created the same user as sad before:Worked, user is connecting. Now I\'ll remove some previlegies from it :)Not sure if anyone else will find this helpful, but I encountered the same error and searched all over for any anonymous users...and there weren\'t any. The problem ended up being that the user account was set to "Require SSL" - which I found in PHPMyAdmin by going to User Accounts and clicking on Edit Privileges for the user. As soon as I unchecked this option, everything worked as expected!MySQL account names consist of a user name and a host name, The name \'localhost\' in host name  indicates the local host also You can use the wildcard characters \xe2\x80\x9c%\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c_\xe2\x80\x9d in host name or IP address values. These have the same meaning as for pattern-matching operations performed with the LIKE operator. For example, a host value of \'%\' matches any host name, whereas a value of \'%.mysql.com\' matches any host in the mysql.com domain. \'192.168.1.%\' matches any host in the 192.168.1 class C network. Above was just introduction:actually both users \'bill\'@\'localhost\' and \'bill\'@\'%\' are different MySQL accounts, hence both should use their own authentication details like password.For more information refer http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman//5.5/en/account-names.html When you run mysql -u bill -p, localhost is resolved to your ip, since it is 127.0.0.1 and in your /etc/hosts file, as default 127.0.0.1       localhost exists. So, mysql interprets you as bill@localhost which is not granted with bill@\'%\' . This is why there are 2 different records for root user in result of select host, user from mysql.user; query.There are two ways to handle this issue. One is specifying an ip which is not reversely resolved by /etc/hosts file when you try to login. For example, the ip of server is 10.0.0.2. When you run the command mysql -u bill -p -h 10.0.0.2, you will be able to login. If you type select user();, you will get bill@10.0.0.2. Of course, any domain name should not be resolved to this ip in your /etc/hosts file.Secondly, you need grant access for this specific domain name. For bill@localhost, you should call command grant all privileges on *.* to bill@localhost identified by \'billpass\'; . In this case, you will be able to login with command mysql -u bill -p. Once logined, select user(); command returns bill@localhost.But this is only for that you try to login a mysql server in the same host. From remote hosts, mysql behaves expectedly, \'%\' will grant you to login.Be sure there are no other SQL instances running that are using the localhost post. In our case another instance was running on the localhost that conflicted with the login. Turning it off solved this problem.Also the problem can occur if you are using old version of the MySQL UI (like SQLYoug) that generates passwords with wrong hash.Creating user with SQL script will fix the problem.I had the same problem, but in my case the solution was solved by the comment by eggyal.  I had an anonymous user as well, but removing it didn\'t solve the problem.  The \'FLUSH PRIVILEGES\' command worked though. The surprising thing to me about this was that I created the user with MySQL Workbench and I would have expected that to perform all of the necessary functions to complete the task.For Mac users if they still have the problem (as was my case), I found this solution worked for me HereTo use command i.e. $mysql on macbook terminal you need to export path using:export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin/\nconsidering default installation use following command to get mysql prompt as root user:mysql -u root\notherwise you are using wrong root password.Ref: Setting the MySQL root user password on OSXThe percent sign means all ip\'s so localhost is superfluous ... There is no need of the second record with the localhost .Actually there is, \'localhost\' is special in mysql, it means a connection over a unix socket (or named pipes on windows I believe) as opposed to a TCP/IP socket. using % as the host does not include \'localhost\'MySQL user accounts have two components: a user name and a host name. The user name identifies the user, and the host name specifies what hosts that user can connect from. The user name and host name are combined to create a user account:\'<user_name>\'@\'<host_name>\'\nYou can specify a specific IP address or address range for host name, or use the percent character ("%") to enable that user to log in from any host. Note that user accounts are defined by both the user name and the host name. For example, \'root\'@\'%\' is a different user account than \'root\'@\'localhost\'.This worked for me:As @RandomSeed said you must be having an anonymous user in your DBMS.\nGive them a name. it will workMaybe you need to add mysql port to you command with -P.Like this mysql -u root -p password -P **portNumber**
