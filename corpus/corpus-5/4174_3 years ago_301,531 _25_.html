I need to pass and recieve two parameters to the state I want to transit to using ui-sref of ui-router.Something like using the link below for transitioning the state to home with foo and bar parameters:Receiving foo and bar values in a controller:I get undefined for $stateParam in the controller.Could somebody help me understand how to get it done?Edit:I\'ve created an example to show how to. Updated state definition would be:And this would be the controller:What we can see is that the state home now has url defined as:which means, that the params in url are expected as These two links will correctly pass arguments into the controller:Also, the controller does consume $stateParams instead of $stateParam.Link to doc:You can check it hereThere is also new, more granular setting params : {}. As we\'ve already seen, we can declare parameters as part of url. But with params : {} configuration - we can extend this definition or even introduce paramters which are not part of the url:Settings available for params are described in the documentation of the $stateProviderBelow is just an extractWe can call these params this way:Check it in action hereYou don\'t necessarily need to have the parameters inside the URL.For instance, with:You will be able to send parameters to the state, using either:Of course, if you reload the page once on the home state, you will loose the state parameters, as they are not stored anywhere.A full description of this behavior is documented here, under the params row in the state(name, stateConfig) section.You simply misspelled $stateParam, it should be $stateParams (with an s). That\'s why you get undefined ;)
