I have some stuff in settings.py that I\'d like to be able to access from a template, but I can\'t figure out how to do it. I already triedbut that doesn\'t seem to work. Is this possible?Django provides access to certain, frequently-used settings constants to the template such as settings.MEDIA_URL and some of the language settings if you use django\'s built in generic views or pass in a context instance keyword argument in the render_to_response shortcut function.  Here\'s an example of each case:These views will both have several frequently used settings like settings.MEDIA_URL available to the template as {{ MEDIA_URL }}, etc.If you\'re looking for access to other constants in the settings, then simply unpack the constants you want and add them to the context dictionary you\'re using in your view function, like so:Now you can access settings.FAVORITE_COLOR on your template as {{ favorite_color }}.  If it\'s a value you\'d like to have for every request & template, using a context processor is more appropriate.Here\'s how:Make a context_processors.py file in your app directory. Let\'s say I want to have the ADMIN_PREFIX_VALUE value in every context:add your context processor to your settings.py file:Use RequestContext in your view to add your context processors in your template. The render shortcut does this automatically:and finally, in your template:I find the simplest approach being a single template tag:Usage:Check out django-settings-export (disclaimer: I\'m the author of this project).For example...Another way to do this is to create a custom template tag which can let you fish values out of the settings.You can then use:to print it on any page, without jumping through context-processor hoops.I like Berislav\'s solution, because on simple sites, it is clean and effective.  What I do NOT like is exposing all the settings constants willy-nilly.  So what I ended up doing was this:Usage:This protects any constants that you have not named from use in the template, and if you wanted to get really fancy, you could set a tuple in the settings, and create more than one template tag for different pages, apps or areas, and simply combine a local tuple with the settings tuple as needed, then do the list comprehension to see if the value is acceptable.\nI agree, on a complex site, this is a bit simplistic, but there are values that would be nice to have universally in templates, and this seems to work nicely.\nThanks to Berislav for the original idea!I improved chrisdew\'s answer (to create your own tag) a little bit.First, create the file yourapp/templatetags/value_from_settings.py in which you define your own new tag value_from_settings:You can use this tag in your Template via:or viaThe advantage of the as ... notation is that this makes it easy to use in blocktrans blocks via a simple {{my_fqdn}}.The example above from bchhun is nice except that you need to explicitly build your context dictionary from settings.py.  Below is an UNTESTED example of how you could auto-build the context dictionary from all upper-case attributes of settings.py (re: "^[A-Z0-9_]+$").At the end of settings.py:If using a class-based view:Both IanSR and bchhun suggested overriding TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS in the settings. Be aware that this setting has a default that can cause some screwy things if you override it without re-setting the defaults. The defaults have also changed in recent versions of Django.https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/settings/#template-context-processorsThe default TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS :If we were to compare context vs. template tags on a single variable, then knowing the more efficient option could be benificial. However, you might be better off to dip into the settings only from templates that need that variable. In that case it doesn\'t make sense to pass the variable into all templates. But if you are sending the variable into a common template such as the base.html template, Then it would not matter as the base.html template is rendered on every request, so you can use either methods.If you decide to go with the template tags option, then use the following code as it allows you to pass a default value in, just in case the variable in-question was undefined.Example: get_from_settings my_variable as my_context_valueExample: get_from_settings my_variable my_default as my_context_valueI found this to be the simplest approach for Django 1.3:views.pyhero.html
