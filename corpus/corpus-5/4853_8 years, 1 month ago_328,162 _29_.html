How can you set the event listener for a Spinner when the selected item changes?Basically what I am trying to do is something similar to this:Some of the previous answers are not correct. They work for other widgets and views, but the documentation for the Spinner widget clearly states: A spinner does not support item click\n  events. Calling this method will raise\n  an exception.Better use OnItemSelectedListener() instead:This works for me.Note that onItemSelected method is also invoked when the view is being build, so you can consider putting it inside onCreate() method call. Note: Remember one thing. Spinner OnItemSelectedListener event will execute twice:Try to differentiate those two by using flag variable.You can implement AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener class in your Activity.And then use the below line within onCreate()Then override these two methods:https://stackoverflow.com/q/1714426/811625You can avoid the OnItemSelectedListener() being called with a simple check: Store the current selection index in an integer variable and check within the onItemSelected(..) before doing anything.E.g:Of cause the iCurrentSelection should be in object scope for this to work!The docs for the spinner-widget says: "A spinner does not support item click events."\nYou should use "setOnItemSelectedListener" to handle your problemFind your spinner name and find id then implement this method.take a global variable for current selection of spinner:It doesn\'t matter will you set OnItemSelectedListener in onCreate or onStart - it will still be called during of Activity creation or start (respectively).\nSo we can set it in onCreate (and NOT in onStart!).\nJust add a flag to figure out first initialisation:then in onCreate (or onCreateView) just:Brilliant the above by Stefan Klumpp also helped me a lot. Thank you.\nI am a newbie and the "@Override"s in it caused an error about "must override a Super class method of the same name". Eclipse suggested I should remove the Overrides. When I did this, it worked. Please don\'t ask me how or why.The best way wht i think would be to have an flagitemselected=0; in oncreate. And on item selected event increment that flag i.e flagitemselected++; and then check if(flagitemselected!=1){// do your work here}.This will help i guessIf you want a true onChangedListener().  Store the initial value in the handler and check to see if it has changed.  It is simple and does not require a global variable.  Works if you have more than one spinner on the page....Objects are your friend,  use them.  One trick I found was putting your setOnItemSelectedListeners in onWindowFocusChanged instead of onCreate. I haven\'t found any bad side-effects to doing it this way, yet. Basically, set up the listeners after the window gets drawn. I\'m not sure how often onWindowFocusChanged runs, but it\'s easy enough to create yourself a lock variable if you are finding it running too often.I think Android might be using a message-based processing system, and if you put it all in onCreate, you may run into situations where the spinner gets populated after it gets drawn. So, your listener will fire off after you set the item location. This is an educated guess, of course, but feel free to correct me on this.
