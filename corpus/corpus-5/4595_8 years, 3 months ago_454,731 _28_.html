I want my script to wait until the user presses any key.How do I do that?In Python 3, no raw_input() exists. So, just use:This only waits for a user to press enter though, so you might want to use msvcrt ((Windows/DOS only) The msvcrt module gives you access to a number of functions in the Microsoft Visual C/C++ Runtime Library (MSVCRT)):This should wait for a key press.One way to do this in Python 2, is to use raw_input():In python3 it\'s just input()On my linux box, I use the following code. This is similar to the manual entry mentioned elsewhere but that code spins in a tight loop where this code doesn\'t and there are lots of odd corner cases that code doesn\'t account for that this code does.If you are ok with depending on system commands you can use the following:Linux:Windows:Simply usingwill cause a SyntaxError: expected EOF while parsing.Simple fix use:The python manual provides the following:which can be rolled into your use case.I don\'t know of a platform independent way of doing it, but under Windows, if you use the msvcrt module, you can use its getch function:mscvcrt also includes the non-blocking kbhit() function to see if a key was pressed without waiting (not sure if there\'s a corresponding curses function).  Under UNIX, there is the curses package, but not sure if you can use it without using it for all of the screen output.  This code works under UNIX:Note that curses.getch() returns the ordinal of the key pressed so to make it have the same output I had to cast it.Cross Platform, Python 2/3 code:I removed the fctl/non-blocking stuff because it was giving IOErrors and I didn\'t need it.  I\'m using this code specifically because I want it to block.  ;)I am new to python and I was already thinking I am too stupid to reproduce the simplest suggestions made here.\nIt turns out, there\'s a pitfall one should know:When a python-script is executed from IDLE, some IO-commands seem to behave completely different (as there is actually no terminal window).Eg. msvcrt.getch is non-blocking and always returns $ff.\nThis has already been reported long ago (see e.g. https://bugs.python.org/issue9290 ) - and it\'s marked as fixed, somehow the problem seems to persist in current versions of python/IDLE.So if any of the code posted above doesn\'t work for you, try running the script manually, and NOT from IDLE.If you want to see if they pressed a exact key (like say \'b\') Do this:os.system seems to always invoke sh, which does not recognize the s and n options for read. However the read command can be passed to bash: or you could do
