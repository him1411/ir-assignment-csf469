I have a web page with three dropdowns for day, month and year. If I use the JavaScript Date constructor that takes numbers then I get a Date object for my current timezone:Give the correct date but it thinks that date is GMT+01:00 due to daylight savings time.The problem here is that I then give this Date to an Ajax method and when the date is deserialised on the server it has been converted to GMT and so lost an hour which moves the day back by one.\nNow I could just pass the day, month, and year individually into the Ajax method but it seems that there ought to be a better way.The accepted answer pointed me in the right direction, however just using setUTCHours by itself changed:toI then also had to set the UTC date, month and year to end up withwhich is what I wantedusing .setUTCHours() it would be possible to actually set dates in UTC-time, which would allow you to use UTC-times throughout the system.You cannot set it using UTC in the constructor though, unless you specify a date-string.Using new Date(Date.UTC(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)) you can create a Date-object from a specific UTC time.When this date object is deserialized, you might get the information you expect.I believe you need the createDateAsUTC function (please compare with convertDateToUTC)I don\'t believe this is possible - there is no ability to set the timezone on a Date object after it is created.And in a way this makes sense - conceptually (if perhaps not in implementation); per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_timestamp (emphasis mine):Unix time, or POSIX time, is a system for describing instants in time, defined as the number of seconds elapsed since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of Thursday, January 1, 1970.Once you\'ve constructed one it will represent a certain point in "real" time.  The time zone is only relevant when you want to convert that abstract time point into a human-readable string.Thus it makes sense you would only be able to change the actual time the Date represents in the constructor.  Sadly it seems that there is no way to pass in an explicit timezone - and the constructor you are calling (arguably correctly) translates your "local" time variables into GMT when it stores them canonically - so there is no way to use the int, int, int constructor for GMT times.On the plus side, it\'s trivial to just use the constructor that takes a String instead.  You don\'t even have to convert the numeric month into a String (on Firefox at least), so I was hoping a naive implementation would work.  However, after trying it out it works successfully in Firefox, Chrome, and Opera but fails in Konqueror ("Invalid Date") , Safari ("Invalid Date") and IE ("NaN").  I suppose you\'d just have a lookup array to convert the month to a string, like so:If you want to deal with the slightly different, but related, problem of creating a Javascript Date object from year, month, day, ..., including timezone \xe2\x80\x93 that is, if you want to parse a string into a Date \xe2\x80\x93 then you apparently have to do an infuriatingly complicated dance:That is, you create a \'UTC time\' using the date without timezone (so you know what locale it\'s in, namely the UTC \'locale\', and it\'s not defaulted to the local one), and then manually apply the indicated timezone offset.Wouldn\'t it have been nice if someone had actually thought about the Javascript date object for more than, oooh, five minutes....I know this is old but if it helps you could use moment and moment time zone.  If you haven\'t seen them take a look.  http://momentjs.com/timezone/http://momentjs.com/two really handy time manipulation libraries.for all location offset Wiki List of UTC time offsetsOne line solution Instead of 1422524805305, use the timestamp in milliseconds\nInstead of 330, use your timezone offset in minutes wrt. GMT (eg India +5:30 is 5*60+30 = 330 minutes)getTimeZoneOffset is minus for UTC + z. This may help someone, put UTC at the end of what you pass in to the new constructorAt least in chrome you can say var date = new Date("2014-01-01 11:00:00 UTC")any mileage in The easiest way that I have found to get the correct date is using datejs. http://www.datejs.com/I get my dates via Ajax in this format as a string: \'2016-01-12T00:00:00\'Console will read:Mon Jan 11 2016 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)Tue Jan 12 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)https://jsfiddle.net/vp1ena7b/3/The \'addMinutes\' comes from datejs, you could probably do this in pure js on your own, but I already had datejs in my project so I found a way to use it to get the correct dates. I thought that this might help someone...
