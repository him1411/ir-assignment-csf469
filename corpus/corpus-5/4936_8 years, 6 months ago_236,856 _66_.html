I need to display user entered text into a fixed size div.  What i want is for the font size to be automatically adjusted so that the text fills the box as much as possible.So - If the div is 400px x 300px.  If someone enters ABC then it\'s really big font.  If they enter a paragraph, then it would be a tiny font.I\'d probably want to start with a maximum font size - maybe 32px, and while the text is too big to fit the container, shrink the font size until it fits.Thanks Attack. I wanted to use jQuery. You pointed me in the right direction, and this is what I ended up with:Here is a link to the plugin: https://plugins.jquery.com/textfill/\nAnd a link to the source: http://jquery-textfill.github.io/and my html is like thisThis is my first jquery plugin, so it\'s probably not as good as it should be. Pointers are certainly welcome.I didn\'t find any of the previous solutions to be adequate enough due to bad performance, so I made my own that uses simple math instead of looping. Should work fine in all browsers as well.According to this performance test case it is much faster then the other solutions found here.If you want to contribute I\'ve added this to Gist.Most of the other answers use a loop to reduce the font-size until it fits on the div, this is VERY slow since the page needs to re-render the element each time the font changes size. I eventually had to write my own algorithm to make it perform in a way that allowed me to update its contents periodically without freezing the user browser. I added some other functionality (rotating text, adding padding) and packaged it as a jQuery plugin, you can get it at:https://github.com/DanielHoffmann/jquery-bigtextsimply calland it will fit nicely on your container.See it in action here:http://danielhoffmann.github.io/jquery-bigtext/For now it has some limitations, the div must have a fixed height and width and it does not support wrapping text into multiple lines.I will work on getting an option to set the maximum font-size.Edit: I have found some more problems with the plugin, it does not handle other box-model besides the standard one and the div can\'t have margins or borders. I will work on it.Edit2: I have now fixed those problems and limitations and added more options. You can set maximum font-size and you can also choose to limit the font-size using either width, height or both. I will work into accepting a max-width and max-height values in the wrapper element.Edit3: I have updated the plugin to version 1.2.0. Major cleanup on the code and new options (verticalAlign, horizontalAlign, textAlign) and support for inner elements inside the span tag (like line-breaks or font-awesome icons.)As much as I love the occasional upvotes I get for this answer (thanks!), this is really not the greatest approach to this problem. Please check out some of the other wonderful answers here, especially the ones that have found solutions without looping.Still, for the sake of reference, here\'s my original answer:And here\'s a version with classes:This is based on what GeekyMonkey posted above, with some modifications.I\'ve created a directive for AngularJS - heavely inspired by GeekyMonkey\'s answer but without the jQuery dependency.Demo: http://plnkr.co/edit/8tPCZIjvO3VSApSeTtYr?p=previewMarkup<div class="fittext" max-font-size="50" text="Your text goes here..."></div>DirectiveI forked the script above from Marcus Ekwall: https://gist.github.com/3945316 and tweaked it to my preferences, it now fires when the window is resized, so that the child always fits its container. I\'ve pasted the script below for reference.Here\'s my modification of the OP\'s answer.In short, many people who tried to optimize this complained that a loop was being used. Yes, while loops can be slow, other approaches can be inaccurate.Therefore, my approach uses Binary Search to find the best Font Size:This also allows the element to specify the minimum and maximum font:Furthermore, this algorithm is unitless. You may specify em, rem, %, etc. and it will use that for its final result.Here\'s the Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/fkhqhnqe/1/I had exactly the same problem with my website. I have a page that is displayed on a projector, on walls, big screens..As I don\'t know the max size of my font, I re-used the plugin above of @GeekMonkey but incrementing the fontsize :Here\'s an improved looping method that uses binary search to find the largest possible size that fits into the parent in the fewest steps possible (this is faster and more accurate than stepping by a fixed font size). The code is also optimized in several ways for performance.By default, 10 binary search steps will be performed, which will get within 0.1% of the optimal size. You could instead set numIter to some value N to get within 1/2^N of the optimal size.Call it with a CSS selector, e.g.: fitToParent(\'.title-span\');Here is a version of the accepted answer which can also take a minFontSize parameter.You can use FitText.js (github page) to solve this problem. Is really small and efficient compared to TextFill. TextFill uses an expensive while loop and FitText don\'t. Also FitText is more flexible (I use it in a proyect with very special requirements and works like a champ!).HTML:You also can set options to it:CSS:And if you need it, FitText also has a no-jQuery version.EDIT: This code was used to show notes on top of a HTML5 video. It changes the font-size on the fly when the video is resized (when the browser window is resized.) The notes was connected to the video (just like notes on YouTube), which is why the code uses instances instead of a DOM handle directly.As per request I\'ll throw in some code that I used to achieve this. (Text boxes over an HTML5 video.) The code was written a long time ago, and I quite frankly think it\'s pretty messy. Since the question is already answered and an answer is already accepted a long time ago I don\'t bother rewriting this. But if anyone wants to simplify this a bit, you\'re more than welcome!You\'ll probably need to tweak these numbers from font-family to font-family. A good way to do this is download a free graph visualizer called GeoGebra. Change the length of the text and the size of the box. Then you manually set the size. Plot the manual results into the coordinate system. Then you enter the two equations I\'ve posted here and you tweak the numbers until "my" graph fits your own manually plotted points.The proposed iterative solutions can be sped up dramatically on two fronts:1) Multiply the font size by some constant, rather than adding or subtracting 1.2) First, zero in using a course constant, say, double the size each loop.  Then, with a rough idea of where to start, do the same thing with a finer adjustment, say, multiply by 1.1.  While the perfectionist might want the exact integer pixel size of the ideal font, most observers don\'t notice the difference between 100 and 110 pixels.  If you are a perfectionist, then repeat a third time with an even finer adjustment.Rather than writing a specific routine or plug-in that answers the exact question, I just rely on the basic ideas and write variations of the code to handle all kinds of layout issues, not just text, including fitting divs, spans, images,... by width, height, area,... within a container, matching another element....Here\'s an example:i know this one is an oldie, but there are still people out there who need this functionality. i went with geekMonkey solution, but its whack. simply because its slow. what he does, is he adjusts the font size to maximum (maxFontPixels) and then checks, if it fits inside the container. else it reduces the font size by 1px and checks again. why not simply check the previous container for the height and submit that value?? (yeah, i know why, but i now made a solution, that only works on the height and also has a min/max option)way quicker solution:and this would be the HTML:again: this solution ONLY checks for the height of the container. that\'s why this function does not has to check, if the element fits inside. but i also implemented a min/max value (40min, 150max) so for me this works perfectly fine (and also works on window resize).I got the same problem and the solution is basically use javascript to control font-size. \nCheck this example on codepen: This is example is only for height, maybe you need to put some if\'s about the width.try to resize it Here is another version of this solution:
