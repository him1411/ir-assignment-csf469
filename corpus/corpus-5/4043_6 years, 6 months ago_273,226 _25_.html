Whenever I need to reference a common module or script, I like to use paths relative to the current script file, that way, my script can always find other scripts in the library.  So, what is the best, standard way of determining the directory of the current script?  Currently, I\'m doing:I know in modules (.psm1) you can use $PSScriptRoot to get this information, but that doesn\'t get set in regular scripts (i.e. .ps1 files).What\'s the canonical way to get the current PowerShell script file\'s location?PowerShell 3+PowerShell 2Prior to PowerShell 3, there was not a better way than querying the\nMyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition property for general scripts. I had the\nfollowing line at the top of essentially every powershell script I had:If you are creating a V2 Module, you can use an automatic variable called\n$PSScriptRoot.From PS > Help automatic_variableFor PowerShell 3.0The function is then:Maybe i\'m missing something here... but if you want the present working directory you can just use this: (Get-Location).Path for a string, or Get-Location for an object.Unless you\'re referring to something like this, which I understand after reading the question again.I needed to know the script name and where it is executing from.Prefixing "$global:" to the MyInvocation structure returns the full path and script name when called from both the main script, and the main line of an imported .PSM1 library file.  It also works from within a function in an imported library.After much fiddling around, I settled on using $global:MyInvocation.InvocationName.\nIt works reliably with CMD launch, Run With Powershell, and the ISE.\nBoth local and UNC launches return the correct path.I use the automatic variable $ExecutionContext, it works from PowerShell 2 and later.$ExecutionContext\n         Contains an EngineIntrinsics object that represents the \n         execution context of the Windows PowerShell host. You can\n         use this variable to find the execution objects that are\n         available to cmdlets.Took me a while to develop something that took the accepted answer and turned it into a robust function.Not sure about others but I work in an environment with machines on both PowerShell version 2 and 3 so I needed to handle both. The following function offers a graceful fallback:It also means that the function refers to the Script scope rather than the parent\'s scope as outlined by Michael Sorens in his blogVery similar to already posted answers, but piping seems more PS-like.For Powershell 3+I\'ve placed this function in my profile. Works in ISE using F8/Run Selection too.You might also consider  split-path -parent $psISE.CurrentFile.Fullpath if any of the other methods fail.  In particular, if you run a file to load a bunch of functions and then execute those functions with-in the ISE shell (or if you run-selected), it seems the Get-Script-Directory function as above doesn\'t work.
