Is there any way to get own phone number by standard APIs from iPhone SDK?At the risk of getting negative marks, I want to suggest that the highest ranking solution (currently the first response) violates the latest SDK Agreement as of Nov 5, 2009. Our application was just rejected for using it. Here\'s the response from Apple:This was a real disappointment since we wanted to spare the user having to enter their own phone number.No, there\'s no legal and reliable way to do this.If you find a way, it will be disabled in the future, as it has happened with every method before.Update: capability appears to have been removed by Apple on or around iOS 4Just to expand on an earlier answer, something like this does it for me:Note: This retrieves the "Phone number" that was entered during the iPhone\'s iTunes activation and can be null or an incorrect value. It\'s NOT read from the SIM card.At least that does in 2.1.  There are a couple of other interesting keys in NSUserDefaults that may also not last.  (This is in my app which uses a UIWebView)and so on.Not sure what, if anything, the others do.Using Private API you can get user phone number on the following way:Also include CoreTelephony.framework to your project. As you probably all ready know if you use the following line of code, your app will be rejected by Apple here is a referencehttp://ayeapi.blogspot.com/2009/12/sbformatphonenumber-is-lie.htmlyou can use the following information insteadand so onHope this helps!To get you phone number you can read a plist file. It will not work on non-jailbroken iDevices:I don\'t know if Apple allow this but it works on iPhones.No official API to do it. Using private API you can use following method:It works on iOS 6 without JB and special signing.As mentioned creker on iOS 7 with JB you need to use entitlements to make it working.How to do it with entitlements you can find here:\niOS 7: How to get own number via private API?You can ask the user m.phone and verficate it using sms. Legally, no method for knows it.You can not get your own phone number due to some security reason but you can fetch your number. Save it to your contact list and then you can fetch your number programmatically.
