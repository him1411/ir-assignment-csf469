Do I have to write a script to uninstall them?  From a cmd.exe window, run these commands:From a cmd.exe window, run these commandsIf you are on Windows 10 and the previous methods did not work try to uninstall the application and reinstall it. But be careful during the installation process unchecking Windows explorer integrationYou can also disable single entries using CCleaner.Only this registry removal - nothing else - worked for me on Win8.1, as of recent versions: When you install msysgit there is an option for "Windows Explorer Integration" that you uncheck to not have them show up.  You can rerun the setup and uncheck the option, or uninstall and reinstall and uncheck it then.in windows 10 nothing of the above did work for me the best solution i found is to uninstall the application and reinstall it  but be careful during the installation process uncheck Windows explorer integration I had a similar issue and I did this. and All above answer is not works for meStep 1 : Type "regedit" in start menuStep 2 : Run the registry editorStep 3 : Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Directory\\Background\\shellStep 4 : click on "shell"Step 5 : Right click on "Git Base Here" and choose delete optionCheers
