I\'ve tried msysGit and Git on Cygwin. Both work just fine in and of themselves and both run gitk and git-gui perfectly.Now how the heck do I configure a mergetool? (Vimdiff works on Cygwin, but preferably I would like something a little more user-friendly for some of our  Windows-loving coworkers.)To follow-up on Charles Bailey\'s answer, here\'s my git setup that\'s using p4merge (free cross-platform 3way merge tool); tested on msys Git (Windows) install:or, from a windows cmd.exe shell, the second line becomes :The changes (relative to Charles Bailey):Download: http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-toolsEDIT (Feb 2014)As pointed out by @Gregory Pakosz, latest msys git now "natively" supports p4merge (tested on 1.8.5.2.msysgit.0).You can display list of supported tools by running:You should see p4merge in either available or valid list. If not, please update your git.If p4merge was listed as available, it is in your PATH and you only have to set merge.tool:If it was listed as valid, you have to define mergetool.p4merge.path in addition to merge.tool:setting mergetool.p4merge.cmd will not work anymore since Git has started trying to support p4merge, see libexec/git-core/git-mergetool--lib.so we just need to specify the mergetool path for git,for example the p4merge:Then it will work.I\'m using Portable Git on WinXP (works a treat!), and needed to resolve a conflict that came up in branching. Of all the gui\'s I checked, KDiff3 proved to be the most transparent to use.But I found the instructions I needed to get it working in Windows in this blog post, instructions which differ slightly from the other approaches listed here. It basically amounted to adding these lines to my .gitconfig file:Working nicely now!Under Cygwin, the only thing that worked for me is the following:Also, I like to turn off the prompt message for difftool:git mergetool is fully configurable so you can pretty much chose your favourite tool.The full documentation is here: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-mergetool.htmlIn brief, you can set a default mergetool by setting the user config variable merge.tool.If the merge tool is one of the ones supported natively by it you just have to set mergetool.<tool>.path to the full path to the tool (replace <tool> by what you have configured merge.tool to be.Otherwise, you can set mergetool.<tool>.cmd to a bit of shell to be eval\'ed at runtime with the shell variables $BASE, $LOCAL, $REMOTE, $MERGED set to the appropriate files. You have to be a bit careful with the escaping whether you directly edit a config file or set the variable with the git config command.Something like this should give the flavour of what you can do (\'mymerge\' is a fictional tool).Once you\'ve setup your favourite merge tool, it\'s simply a matter of running git mergetool whenever you have conflicts to resolve.The p4merge tool from Perforce is a pretty good standalone merge tool.It seems that newer git versions support p4merge directly, soshould be all you need, if p4merge.exe is on your path. No need to set up cmd or path.As already answered here (and here and here), mergetool is the command to configure this. For a nice graphical frontend I recommend kdiff3 (GPL).For beyond compare on Windows 7I had to drop the extra quoting using msysGit on windows 7, not sure why.If you\'re doing this through cygwin, you may need to use cygpath:Bah, this finally worked for me (Windows 7 + Cygwin + TortoiseMerge):In .git/config:Thanks to previous posters for the tip to use cygpath!i use an app called WinMerge ( http://winmerge.org/ )\ninfo from their manual ( http://manual.winmerge.org/CommandLine.html )this is the bash script i use from the mergetool directive via .gitconfigbasically the bash accounts for when the result of the diff in an empty file and creates a new temp file in the correct location.You may want to add these options too:Also, I don\'t know why but the quoting and slash from Milan Gardian\'s answer screwed things up for me.If anyone wants to use gvim as their diff tool on TortoiseGit, then this is what you need to enter into the text input for the path to the external diff tool:For IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition) 3-way git mergetool configuration in Windows environment (~/.gitconfig)Cygwin MsysThe ~/winpath.sh is to convert paths to Windows on msys and is taken from msys path conversion question on stackoverflow To setup p4merge, installed using chocolatey on windows for both merge and diff, take a look here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/CamW/88e95ea8d9f0786d746aIf you\'re having problems opening p4merge from SourceTree look for you local configuration file named config under MyRepo.git and delete any merge configuration.\nIn my case it was trying to open Meld which I just uninstalled I found two ways to configure "SourceGear DiffMerge" as difftool and mergetool in github Windows.The following commands in a Command Prompt window will update your .gitconfig to configure GIT use DiffMerge:[OR]Add the following lines to your .gitconfig.
