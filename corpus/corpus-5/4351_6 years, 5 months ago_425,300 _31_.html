I am trying to create a basic auth through browser, but I can\'t really get there.If this script won\'t be here the browser auth will take over, but I want to tell the browser that the user is about to make the authentication.The address should be something like:I have a form:And a script:Use jQuery\'s beforeSend callback to add an HTTP header with the authentication information:How things change in a year. In addition to the header attribute in place of xhr.setRequestHeader, current jQuery (1.7.2+) includes a username and password attribute with the $.ajax call.EDIT from comments and other answers: To be clear - in order to preemptively send authentication without a 401 Unauthorized response, instead of setRequestHeader (pre -1.7) use \'headers\':Use the beforeSend callback to add a HTTP header with the authentication information like so:Or, simply use the headers property introduced in 1.5:Reference: jQuery Ajax APIThe examples above are a bit confusing, this is probably the best wayI took the above from a combination of Rico and Yossi\'s answerThe btoa function base64 encodes a stringUse the jQuery ajaxSetup function, that can set up default values for all ajax requests.As others have suggested, you can set the username and password directly in the ajax call: OR use the headers property if you would rather not store your creds in plain text:Whichever way you send it, the server has to be very polite. For Apache, your .htaccess file should look something like this:For some cross domain requests, the browser sends a preflight OPTIONS request that is missing your auth headers. Wrap your auth directives inside the LimitExcept tag to respond properly to the preflight. Then send a few headers to tell the browser that it is allowed to authenticate, and the  Access-Control-Allow-Origin to grant permission for the cross-site request.In some cases, the * wildcard doesn\'t work as a value for Access-Control-Allow-Origin: You need to return the exact domain of the callee. Use SetEnvIf to capture this value.JSONP does not work with basic authentication so the jQuery beforeSend callback won\'t work with JSONP/Script.I managed to work around this limitation by adding the user and password to the request (e.g. user:pw@domain.tld). This works with pretty much any browser but IE where authentication through URLs is not supported (the call will simply not be executed). See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/834489 .According to SharkAlley answer it works with nginx too,\nI was search for solution to get data by jQuery from server behind nginx and restricted by Base Auth, this works for me:And JS is:Article that I find useful: There are 3 ways to achieve this as shown belowMethod 1: Method 2: Method 3:
