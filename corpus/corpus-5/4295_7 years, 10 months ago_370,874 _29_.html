How can I automatically scale the HTML5 <canvas> element to fit the page?For example, I can get a <div> to scale by setting the height and width properties to 100%, but a <canvas> won\'t scale, will it?I believe I have found an elegant solution to this:JavaScriptCSSHasn\'t had any large negative performance impact for me, so far.The following solution worked for me the best.  Since I\'m relatively new to coding, I like to have visual confirmation that something is working the way I expect it to.  I found it at the following site:\nhttp://htmlcheats.com/html/resize-the-html5-canvas-dyamically/Here\'s the code:The blue border shows you the edge of the resizing canvas, and is always along the edge of the window, visible on all 4 sides, which was NOT the case for some of the other above answers.  Hope it helps.Basically what you have to do is to bind the onresize event to your body, once you catch the event you just need to resize the canvas using window.innerWidth and   window.innerHeight.Setting the canvas coordinate space width and height based on the browser client\'s dimensions requires you to resize and redraw whenever the browser is resized. A less convoluted solution is to maintain the drawable dimensions in Javascript variables, but set the canvas dimensions based on the screen.width, screen.height dimensions.  Use CSS to fit:The browser window generally won\'t ever be larger than the screen itself (except where the screen resolution is misreported, as it could be with non-matching dual monitors), so the background won\'t show and pixel proportions won\'t vary. The canvas pixels will be directly proportional to the screen resolution unless you use CSS to scale the canvas. Unless you want the canvas to upscale your image data automatically (that\'s what James Black\'s answer talks about, but it won\'t look pretty), you have to resize it yourself and redraw the image. Centering a canvasA pure CSS approach adding to solution of @jerseyboy above.\nWorks in Firefox (tested in v29), Chrome (tested in v34) and Internet Explorer (tested in v11).Link to the example: http://temporaer.net/open/so/140502_canvas-fit-to-window.htmlBut take care, as @jerseyboy states in his comment:Rescaling canvas with CSS is troublesome. At least on Chrome and\n  Safari, mouse/touch event positions will not correspond 1:1 with\n  canvas pixel positions, and you\'ll have to transform the coordinate\n  systems.If your div completely filled the webpage then you can fill up that div and so have a canvas that fills up the div.You may find this interesting, as you may need to use a css to use percentage, but, it depends on which browser you are using, and how much it is in agreement with the spec:\nhttp://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-elementThe intrinsic dimensions of the canvas\n  element equal the size of the\n  coordinate space, with the numbers\n  interpreted in CSS pixels. However,\n  the element can be sized arbitrarily\n  by a style sheet. During rendering,\n  the image is scaled to fit this layout\n  size.You may need to get the offsetWidth and height of the div, or get the window height/width and set that as the pixel value.If you\'re interested in preserving aspect ratios and doing so in pure CSS (given the aspect ratio) you can do something like below. The key is the padding-bottom on the ::content element that sizes the container element. This is sized relative to its parent\'s width, which is 100% by default. The ratio specified here has to match up with the ratio of the sizes on the canvas element.CSSJavaScriptI think this is what should we exactly do: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/casestudies/gopherwoord-studios-resizing-html5-games/I\'m using sketch.js so after I run the init command for the canvas i change the width and height with jquery. It bases the dimensions on the parent element.$(\'#DrawCanvas\').sketch().attr(\'height\',$(\'#DrawCanvas\').parent().height()).attr(\'width\',$(\'#DrawCanvas\').parent().width());
