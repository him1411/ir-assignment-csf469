Using the rails 3 style how would I write the opposite of:I want to find where id is NOT null.  I tried:But that returns:That\'s definitely not what I need, and almost seems like a bug in ARel.The canonical way to do this with Rails 3:ActiveRecord 4.0 and above adds where.not so you can do this:I no longer recommend using Squeel for this as it doesn\'t always have a full-time maintainer, and it depends on private APIs that cause frequent breaking changes.It\'s not a bug in ARel, it\'s a bug in your logic.What you want here is:For Rails4:So, what you\'re wanting is an inner join, so you really should just use the joins predicate:But, for the record, if you want a "NOT NULL" condition simply use the not predicate:Note that this syntax reports a deprecation (it talks about a string SQL snippet, but I guess the hash condition is changed to string in the parser?), so be sure to add the references to the end:DEPRECATION WARNING: It looks like you are eager loading table(s) (one\n  of: ....) that are referenced in a string SQL snippet. For example:Currently, Active Record recognizes the table in the string, and knows\n  to JOIN the comments table to the query, rather than loading comments\n  in a separate query. However, doing this without writing a full-blown\n  SQL parser is inherently flawed. Since we don\'t want to write an SQL\n  parser, we are removing this functionality. From now on, you must\n  explicitly tell Active Record when you are referencing a table from a\n  string:With Rails 4 it\'s easy:See also: \n    http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#not-conditionsNot sure of this is helpful but this what worked for me in Rails 4
