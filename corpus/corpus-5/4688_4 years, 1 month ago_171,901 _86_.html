I installed nodejs on ubuntu from instructions given hereWhen I write node --version in the terminal I see this : \n-bash: /usr/sbin/node: No such file or directoryI can see node in the /usr/sbin/ directory, though.Writing npm --version shows 1.3.5 \nWriting nodejs --version shows v0.10.15Also, I can see node in the /usr/bin/ directory.So, how do I get node working?Also, If I use zsh instead of bash, then node command works.You need to manually create a symlink /usr/bin/node. Shortcut for bash compatible shells:Or if you use non-standard shells, just hardcode the path you find with which nodejs:Later editI found this explanation in the link you postedThere is a naming conflict with the node package (Amateur Packet Radio Node Program), and the nodejs binary has been renamed from node to nodejs. You\'ll need to symlink /usr/bin/node to /usr/bin/nodejs or you could uninstall the Amateur Packet Radio Node Program to avoid that conflict.Later later editIt\'s been a while since I answered this. Although the solution I posted up here worked for me several times, users have reported a few more solutions within the comments:From @user229115sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/node node /usr/bin/nodejs 10From AskUbuntu (user leftium)I think this is it:Using Debian alternatives.Apparently the solution differs between Ubuntu versions.  Following worked for me on Ubuntu 13.10:HTHI have the same issue in Ubuntu 14.04.I have installed "nodejs" and it\'s working, but only if I\'m use command "nodejs". If I try to use "node" nothing happens.I\'m fixed this problem in next way:Install nodejs-legacyAfter that, when I type "node" in command line I\'m get an error message "/usr/sbin/node: No such file or directory"Second, what I did, it\'s a symbolic link on "nodejs":This happened to me as well. The issue was that I had installed node from source some time ago. Running always pointed to this local installation. Also, pointed to the local installation.deleting the directory with the source install didn\'t help. It just broke the node command.  In the end, unsetting the NODE_PATH environmental variable and purging then reinstalling nodejs did the trick.After this, and npm install started to work for packages depending on Node => 5.0.I am new to all this, but for me a simple alias worked: at least for running things directly in bash and executing .js files. Late answer, but for up-to-date info...If you install node.js using the recommend method from the node github installation readme, it suggests following the instructions on the nodesource blog article, rather than installing from the out of date apt-get repo, node.js should run using the node command, as well as the nodejs command, without having to make a new symlink.This method from article is:Note that this is for v0.12, which will get likely become outdated in the not to distant future.Also, if you\'re behind a corporate proxy (like me) you\'ll want to add the -E option to the sudo command, to preserve the env vars required for the proxy:curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo -E bash -How about using the official instructions from the nodejs site:For v7:For v6:For v4:I\'ve tested these from Windows bash (via subsystem for Linux - 14.04) and raspbian (ARM Debian based). Running sudo apt-get install -y nodejs without first running the setup script will result in you getting node 0.10.If you are planning on installing native npm modules requiring build, also run:Note: this is the recommended path for any Debian based distro across all architectures.If you like to install multiple nodejs versions and easily switch between them, I would suggest using Node Version Manger. It also solves the naming problem (node vs nodejs)It\'s quite simple:Install a nodejs version:Now you have nodejs 4.4 in addition to the version that was already installed and you can just use the node command to reach the newly installed version:You can install more nodejs versions and easily switch between them:Adding to @randunel\'s correct answer (can\'t yet comment on SO):I also had to symlink /usr/local/bin/node to /usr/bin/nodejs as well. Apparently, this was overriding the /usr/bin/ node command.No idea how that got set, but hope it helps someone else as it was a pain to figure out why the above wasn\'t working for me. This works for me:After following the instructions in this link.I had the same issue symbolic link helped me out:\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node\nafter that \nsudo npm install -g phantomjs-prebuiltwent smoothlyIf you are on an AWS EC2 instance running an Ubuntu instance (tested on Ubuntu 16.x), then these steps might work for you:If all is correct the last command shall have an output like : v6.x.xIf not then run the following:Hopefully this will help. It helped me magically (hehe).Best way to install nodejs is through NVM (Node Version Manager)Delete previous versions : Also delete all node_modules by $ sudo rm -rf node_modules in the directory containing this folder.Node & Nodejs are technically the same thing. Just the naming changed.First Install or update nvm to run as root ThenOR Check nvm to path if you get error regarding the listing then install git.Re-run : Checking VersionINFORMATION COURTESY : I had created a symlink, but it still wasn\'t working.I forgot to restart my terminal (my putty connection). After I had it worked without the symlink :)Will be helpful for absolute beginnersAlthough, you have got the answer, just wanted to point out that the node command (without any parameters) will start node in REPL read-eval-print-loop mode to execute raw javascript code.Another way to use node command is by providing it a js file as a parameter. This is how we mostly use it.It\'s optional to remove the existing node and nodejs, but have to do alternatively install the latest 7.x nodejs.
