I can\'t find it for some reason, feeling a little dumb. How do I know? I\'m using .net 4 with VS2010.Open web.config file and find the System.Web.Mvc assembly definition:It\'s an MVC3 as you see. Via web you can use MvcDiagnostics which is similar to phpinfo() functionality in PHP.Select the System.Web.Mvc assembly in the "References" folder in the solution explorer.  Bring up the properties window (F4) and check the VersionGives the current version programaticallyAnother solution is to search for mvc in nuget (right click on your MVC project in visual studio and select "Manage Nuget Packages"). This will show you the version currently installed -And it\'ll also allow you to update the MVC version -\nWell just use MvcDiagnostics.aspx It shows lots information about current MVC instalations, and also helps with debuging. You can find it in MVC source or just Google for it.I had this question because there is no MVC5 template in VS 2013. We had to select ASP.NET web application and then choose MVC from the next window.You can check in the System.Web.Mvc dll\'s properties like in the below image.I chose System.web.MVC from reference folder and right clicked on it to go property window where I could see version of MVC. This solution works for me. Thanks
