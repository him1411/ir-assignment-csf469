I\'m new to Rails so my current project is in a weird state. One of the first things I generated was a "Movie" model. I then started defining it in more detail, added a few methods, etc.I now realize I should have generated it with rails generate scaffold to hook up things like the routing, views, controller, etc. I tried to generate the scaffolding but I got an error saying a migration file with the same name already exists.What\'s the best way for me to create scaffolding for my "Movie" now? (using rails 3)TL;DR: rails g scaffold_controller <name>Even though you already have a model, you can still generate the necessary controller and migration files by using the rails generate option. If you run rails generate -h you can see all of the options available to you.If you\'d like to generate a controller scaffold for your model, see scaffold_controller. Just for clarity, here\'s the description on that:Stubs out a scaffolded controller and its views. Pass the model name,\n      either CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of views as arguments.\n      The controller name is retrieved as a pluralized version of the model\n      name.To create a controller within a module, specify the model name as a\n      path like \'parent_module/controller_name\'.This generates a controller class in app/controllers and invokes helper,\n      template engine and test framework generators.To create your resource, you\'d use the resource generator, and to create a migration, you can also see the migration generator (see, there\'s a pattern to all of this madness). These provide options to create the missing files to build a resource. Alternatively you can just run rails generate scaffold with the --skip option to skip any files which exist :)I recommend spending some time looking at  the options inside of the generators. They\'re something I don\'t feel are documented extremely well in books and such, but they\'re very handy.Great answer by Lee Jarvis, this is just the command e.g; we already have an existing model called User:For the ones starting a rails app with existing database there is a cool gem called schema_to_scaffold to generate a scaffold script.\nit outputs:rails g scaffold users fname:string lname:string bdate:date email:string encrypted_password:stringfrom your schema.rb our your renamed schema.rb. Check itThis command should do the trick:You can make use of scaffold_controller and remember to pass the attributes of the model, or scaffold will be generated without the attributes.This command will generate following files:
