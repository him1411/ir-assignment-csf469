I have a local Git repo that I would like to push to a new remote repo (brand new repo set up on Beanstalk, if that matters). My local repo has a few branches and tags and I would like to keep all of my history. It looks like I basically just need to do a git push, but that only uploads the master branch. How do I push everything so I get a full replica of my local repo on the remote?To push all your branches, use either (replace REMOTE with the name of the remote, for example "origin"):To push all your tags:Finally, I think you can do this all in one command with:However, in addition --mirror, will also push your remotes, so this might not be exactly what you want.In the case like me that you aquired a repo and are now switching the remote origin to a different repo, a new empty one... So you have your repo and all the branches inside, but you still need to checkout those branches for the git push --all command to actually push those too.You should do this before you push:Followed byHere is another take on the same thing which worked better for the situation I was in. It solves the problem where you have more than one remote, would like to clone all branches in remote source to remote destination but without having to check them all out beforehand.(The problem I had with Daniel\'s solution was that it would refuse to checkout a tracking branch from the source remote if I had previously checked it out already, ie, it would not update my local branch before the push)Note:\n  If you are not using direct CLI, you must escape the asterisks:git push destination +refs/remotes/source/\\*:refs/heads/\\*this will push all branches in remote source to a head branch in destination, possibly doing a non-fast-forward push. You still have to push tags separately.The manpage for git-push is worth a read. Combined with this website I wrote the following in my .git/config:The push = : means "push any \'matching\' branches (i.e. branches that already exist in the remote repository and have a local counterpart)", while push = refs/tags/* means "push all tags".So now I only have to run git push to push all matching branches and all tags.Yes, this is not quite what the OP wanted (all of the branches to push must already exist on the remote side), but might be helpful for those who find this question while googling for "how do I push branches and tags at the same time".In my case what worked was.This is the most concise way I have found, provided the destination is empty. Switch to an empty folder and then:Substitute https://... for file:///your/repo etc. as appropriate.To push branches and tags (but not remotes):This would be equivalent to combining the --tags and --all options for git push, which git does not seem to allow.I found above answers still have some unclear things, which will mislead users. First, It\'s sure that git push new_origin --all and git push new_origin --mirror can\'t duplicate all branches of origin, it just duplicate your local existed branches to your new_origin.Below is two useful methods I have tested:1,duplicate by clone bare repo.git clone --bare origin_url, then enter the folder, and git push new_origin_url --mirror.By this way, you can also use git clone --mirror origin_url, both --bareand --mirror will download a bare repo,not including workspace. please refer this2,If you have a git repo by using git clone, which means you have bare repo and git workspace, you can use git remote add new_origin new_origin_url, and then git push new_origin +refs/remotes/origin/\\*:refs/heads/\\*,and then git push new_origin --tagsBy this way, you will get a extra head branch, which make no sense.Based in @Daniel answer I did:I found that none of these seemed to work properly for me. Feel free to flame this to death but for some reason couldn\'t get the other options to work properly.Expected result was a repo "cloned" to another remote (ie from Github to another provider):The major issue I was seeing was either all remote branches didn\'t get recreated in the new remote. If a command did, the new remote did not have the branch history (ie doing a git checkout branch; git log wouldn\'t show the expected branch commits).I noticed git checkout -b branchname is NOT the same as git checkout branchname (the latter being what I needed). I notice git checkout --track branchname didn\'t appear to pull the branch history.My Solution (powershell based):\n
