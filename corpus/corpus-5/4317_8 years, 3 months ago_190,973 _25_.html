Is there an elegant way to access the first property of an object...For example, I need to access foo1 object without knowing the name of foo1:Using this you can access also other properties by indexes. Be aware tho! Because properties are ordered inside object depending on javascript implementation. However if you are certain that object has only 1 property then its the way to go(not the fastest tho). Try the for \xe2\x80\xa6 in loop and break after the first iteration:Use Object.keys to get an array of the properties on an object. Example:Documentation and cross-browser shim provided here. An example of its use can be found in another one of my answers here.Edit: for clarity, I just want to echo what was correctly stated in other answers: the key order in javascript objects is undefined.There isn\'t a "first" property. Object keys are unordered.If you loop over them with for (var foo in bar) you will get them in some order, but it may change in future (especially if you add or remove other keys).A one-rule version:No. An object literal, as defined by MDC is:a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}).Therefore an object literal is not an array, and you can only access the properties using their explicit name or a for loop using the in keyword.This has been covered here before.The concept of first does not apply to object properties, and the order of a for...in loop is not guaranteed by the specs, however in practice  it is reliably FIFO except critically for chrome (bug report). Make your decisions accordingly.I don\'t recommend you to use Object.keys since its not supported in old IE versions. But if you really need that, you could use the code above to guarantee the back compatibility:Feature     Firefox (Gecko)4 (2.0)   Chrome 5  Internet Explorer 9  Opera 12    Safari 5More info: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keysBut if you only need the first one, we could arrange a shorter solution like:You can also do Object.values(example)[0].If you need to access "the first property of an object", it might mean that there is something wrong with your logic. The order of an object\'s properties should not matter.Use an array instead of an object (square brackets).Note that you lose the \'foo\' identifiers. But you could add a name property to the contained objects:Solution with lodash library:but there is no guarantee of the object properties internal storage order because it depends on javascript VM implementation.
