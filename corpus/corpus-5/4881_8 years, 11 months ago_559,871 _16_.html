Possible Duplicate:\n  How do you determine the size of a file in C? How can I find out the size of a file? I opened with an application written in C. \nI would like to know the size, because I want to put the content of the loaded file into a string, which I alloc using malloc(). Just writing malloc(10000*sizeof(char)); is IMHO a bad idea. You need to seek to the end of the file and then ask for the position:You can then seek back, e.g.:or (if seeking to go to the beginning)Assuming that your implementation meaningfully supports SEEK_END:You can use stat (if you know the filename), or fstat (if you have the file descriptor).Here is an example for stat:You can use GetFileSize or GetFileSizeEx.If you have the file descriptor fstat() returns a stat structure which contain the file size.Have you considered not computing the file size and just growing the array if necessary?  Here\'s an example (with error checking ommitted):This has the advantage of working even for streams in which it is impossible to get the file size (like stdin).If you\'re on Linux, seriously consider just using the g_file_get_contents function from glib.  It handles all the code for loading a file, allocating memory, and handling errors.I ended up just making a short and sweet fsize function(note, no error checking)It\'s kind of silly that the standard C library doesn\'t have such a function, but I can see why it\'d be difficult as not every "file" has a size(for instance /dev/null) HTH
