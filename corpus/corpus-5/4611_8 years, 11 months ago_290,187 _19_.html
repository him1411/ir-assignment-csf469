I am currently defining regular expressions in order to capture parameters in a url, as described in the tutorial. How do I access parameters from the url as part the HttpRequest object? My HttpRequest.GET currently returns an empty QueryDict object. I\'d like to learn how to do this without a library so I can get to know Django better. If your url is something like domain/search/?q=haha, Then you would use request.GET.get(\'q\', \'\').q is the parameter you want, And \'\' is the default value if q isn\'t found.If you are instead just configuring your URLconf, Then your captures from the regex are passed to the function as arguments (or named arguments).Such as:Then in your views.py you would have To clarify camflan\'s explanation, let\'s suppose you haveThe URL dispatcher rule will catch parts of the URL path (here "user/thaiyoshi/") and pass them to the view function along with the request object.The query string (here message=Hi) is parsed and parameters are stored as a QueryDict in request.GET. No further matching or processing for HTTP GET parameters is done.This view function would use both parts extracted from the URL path and a query parameter:As a side note, you\'ll find the request method (in this case "GET", and for submitted forms usually "POST") in request.method. In some cases it\'s useful to check that it matches what you\'re expecting.Update: When deciding whether to use the URL path or the query parameters for passing information, the following may help:Using GETUsing POSTI would like to share a tip that may save you some time.\nIf you plan to use something like this in your urls.py file:Which basically means www.example.com/<username>. Be sure to place it at the end of your URL entries, because otherwise, it is prone to cause conflicts with the URL entries that follow below, i.e. accessing one of them will give you the nice error: User matching query does not exist. \nI\'ve just experienced it myself; hope it helps!This is not exactly what you asked for, but this snippet is helpful for managing query_strings in templates.For situations where you only have the request object you can use request.parser_context[\'kwargs\'][\'your_param\']
