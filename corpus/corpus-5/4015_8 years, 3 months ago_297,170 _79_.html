How do you reverse a string in place (or in-place) in JavaScript when passed to a function with a return statement?  All without using the built-in functions? .reverse(), .charAt(), etc.As long as you\'re dealing with simple ASCII characters, and you\'re happy to use built-in functions, this will work:If you need a solution that supports UTF-16 or other multi-byte characters, be aware that this function will give invalid unicode strings, or valid strings that look funny. You might want to consider this answer instead.The following technique (or similar) is commonly used to reverse a string in JavaScript:In fact, all the answers posted so far are a variation of this pattern. However, there are some problems with this solution. For example:If you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering why this happens, read up on JavaScript\xe2\x80\x99s internal character encoding. (TL;DR: \xf0\x9d\x8c\x86 is an astral symbol, and JavaScript exposes it as two separate code units.)But there\xe2\x80\x99s more:A good string to test string reverse implementations is the following:Why? Because it contains an astral symbol (\xf0\x9d\x8c\x86) (which are represented by surrogate pairs in JavaScript) and a combining mark (the n\xcc\x83 in the last man\xcc\x83ana actually consists of two symbols: U+006E LATIN SMALL LETTER N and U+0303 COMBINING TILDE).The order in which surrogate pairs appear cannot be reversed, else the astral symbol won\xe2\x80\x99t show up anymore in the \xe2\x80\x98reversed\xe2\x80\x99 string. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you saw those \xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd marks in the output for the previous example.Combining marks always get applied to the previous symbol, so you have to treat both the main symbol (U+006E LATIN SMALL LETTER N) as the combining mark (U+0303 COMBINING TILDE) as a whole. Reversing their order will cause the combining mark to be paired with another symbol in the string. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the example output had a\xcc\x83 instead of \xc3\xb1.Hopefully, this explains why all the answers posted so far are wrong.To answer your initial question \xe2\x80\x94 how to [properly] reverse a string in JavaScript \xe2\x80\x94, I\xe2\x80\x99ve written a small JavaScript library that is capable of Unicode-aware string reversal. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any of the issues I just mentioned. The library is called Esrever; its code is on GitHub, and it works in pretty much any JavaScript environment. It comes with a shell utility/binary, so you can easily reverse strings from your terminal if you want.As for the \xe2\x80\x9cin-place\xe2\x80\x9d part, see the other answers.orThe whole "reverse a string in place" is an antiquated interview question C programmers, and people who were interviewed by them (for revenge, maybe?), will ask.  Unfortunately, it\'s the "In Place" part that no longer works because strings in pretty much any managed language (JS, C#, etc) uses immutable strings, thus defeating the whole idea of moving a string without allocating any new memory.While the solutions above do indeed reverse a string, they do not do it without allocating more memory, and thus do not satisfy the conditions.  You need to have direct access to the string as allocated, and be able to manipulate its original memory location to be able to reverse it in place.Personally, i really hate these kinds of interview questions, but sadly, i\'m sure we\'ll keep seeing them for years to come.Detailed analysis and ten different ways to reverse a string and their performance details.http://eddmann.com/posts/ten-ways-to-reverse-a-string-in-javascript/Perfomance of these implementations:Best performing implementation(s) per browserHere are those implementations:Implementation 1:Implementation 2:Implementation 3:Implementation 4:Implementation 5:Implementation 6:Implementation 7:Implementation 8:Implementation 9:Implementation 10Seems like I\'m 3 years late to the party...Unfortunately you can\'t as has been pointed out. See Are JavaScript strings immutable? Do I need a "string builder" in JavaScript?The next best thing you can do is to create a "view" or "wrapper", which takes a string and reimplements whatever parts of the string API you are using, but pretending the string is reversed. For example:Demo:The kicker -- the following is done in-place by pure math, visiting each character only once, and only if necessary:This yields significant savings if applied to a very large string, if you are only taking a relatively small slice thereof.Whether this is worth it (over reversing-as-a-copy like in most programming languages) highly depends on your use case and how efficiently you reimplement the string API. For example if all you want is to do string index manipulation, or take small slices or substrs, this will save you space and time. If you\'re planning on printing large reversed slices or substrings however, the savings may be small indeed, even worse than having done a full copy. Your "reversed" string will also not have the type string, though you might be able to fake this with prototyping.The above demo implementation creates a new object of type ReversedString. It is prototyped, and therefore fairly efficient, with almost minimal work and minimal space overhead (prototype definitions are shared). It is a lazy implementation involving deferred slicing. Whenever you perform a function like .slice or .reversed, it will perform index mathematics. Finally when you extract data (by implicitly calling .toString() or .charCodeAt(...) or something), it will apply those in a "smart" manner, touching the least data possible.Note: the above string API is an example, and may not be implemented perfectly. You also can use just 1-2 functions which you need.In ECMAScript 6, you can reverse a string even faster without using .split(\'\') split method, with the spread operator like so: First, use Array.from() to turn a string into an array, then Array.prototype.reverse() to reverse the array, and then Array.prototype.join() to make it back a string.During an interview, I was asked to reverse a string without using any variables or native methods. This is my favorite implementation:This is the easiest way I thinkI know that this is an old question that has been well answered, but for my own amusement I wrote the following reverse function and thought I would share it in case it was useful for anyone else.  It handles both surrogate pairs and combining marks:All props to Mathias, Punycode, and various other references for schooling me on the complexities of character encoding in JavaScript.OR// Output: \'gnirts elpmas\'The real answer is: you can\'t reverse it in place, but you can create a new string that is the reverse.Just as an exercise to play with recursion:  sometimes when you go to an interview, the interviewer may ask you how to do this using recursion, and I think the "preferred answer" might be "I would rather not do this in recursion as it can easily cause a stack overflow" (because it is O(n) rather than O(log n). If it is O(log n), it is quite difficult to get a stack overflow -- 4 billion items could be handled by a stack level of 32, as 2 ** 32 is 4294967296.  But if it is O(n), then it can easily get a stack overflow.Sometimes the interviewer will still ask you, "just as an exercise, why don\'t you still write it using recursion?"  And here it is:test run:output:To try getting a stack overflow, I changed 1000 to 10000 in Google Chrome, and it reported:Strings themselves are immutable, but you can easily create a reversed copy with the following code:without converting string to array;using Array.reverse without converting characters to code points;I think String.prototype.reverse is a good way to solve this problem;\nthe code as below;Using Array functions,My own original attempt...http://jsbin.com/bujiwo/19/edit?js,console,outputKeep it DRY and simple silly!!OK, pretty simple, you can create a function with a simple loop to do the string reverse for you without using reverse(), charAt() etc like this:For example you have this string:Create a function like this, I call it reverseString...And you can call it like:And the result will be:Another variation (does it work with IE?):EDIT:This is without the use of built-in functions:Note: this[-1] holds a length of the string.However it\'s not possible to reverse the string in place, since the assignment to\nindividual array elements doesn\'t work with String object (protected?). I.e. you can do assigns, but the resulting string doesn\'t change.//outputs: gnirts desrever a si sihTThe below might help anyone that is looking to reverse a string recursively. Was asked to do this in a recent job interview using functional programming style:Adding to the String prototype is ideal (just in case it gets added into the core JS language), but you first need to check if it exists, and add it if it doesn\'t exist, like so:I guess, this will work for you
