Trying to move over my stuff to use Toolbar instead of action bar but I keep getting an error sayingso then I added in my style for my activity to have no actionbarand the theme is applies to activties in my manifestMainActivity extends GooglePlayServiceActivity so I also set the theme there toobut I still get the error. I also do not request window feature anywhere. any ideas why I still get this?I think you\'re developing for Android Lollipop, but anyway include this line:to your theme declaration inside of your app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml.Also, if you\'re using AppCompatActivity support library of version 22.1 or greater, add this line:Your theme declaration may look like this after all these additions:Another easy way is to make your theme a child of Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar like so:Add single line android:theme="@style/AppTheme.NoActionBar" to activity in AndroidManifest and you\'ve done.AndroidManifest.xml:styles.xmlTo use Toolbar as an Action Bar, first disable the decor-provided Action Bar. The easiest way is to have your theme extend from Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar(or its light variant).Second, create a Toolbar instance, usually via your layout XML:Then in your Activity or Fragment, set the Toolbar to act as your Action Bar:This code worked for me.If you want to combine some activities with actionbar and others not, you should use the base theme have actionbar enabled and then create a sub theme that you gonna use it on activities that don\'t require actionbarFor example you can use a sub style like thisWhile the base theme extends say and then use the non actionbar theme in the AndroidManifest File within the activity tag say you must apply this to each individual activity that don\'t need actionbar so if your project requires fewer action bar activities than non, then it\'s better to apply this on the base theme levelAdd this in your values/styles.xmlAnd add the following code in your values-v11/styles.xml and values-v14/styles.xmlThats it. It will work.Go to the \'style.xml\' of your project and make windowActionBar to falseAdd this two line in your app theme located in style.xml:-I also faced same problem. But I used:getSupportActionBar().hide();before setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); Now it is working.You need to change these lines in the manifest.It will perfectly work for me.If you are using Appcompact Activity use these three lines in your theme.Simply put, you can do the following:-This is how I solved the problem. Add below code in your AndroidMainfest.xmlI had toolbar added in my xml. Then in my activity i was adding this statement:Removing this worked for me. I hope it helps someone.Also a shorter version of a style can help:I solved it by removing this line:  android:theme="@style/Theme.MyCompatTheme" from activity properties in the Manifest file
