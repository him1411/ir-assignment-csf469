Which Python library can I use to extract filenames from paths, no matter what the operating system or path format could be?For example, I\'d like all of these paths to return me c:Using os.path.split or os.path.basename as others suggest won\'t work in all cases: if you\'re running the script on Linux and attempt to process a classic windows-style path, it will fail.Windows paths can use either backslash or forward slash as path separator. Therefore, the ntpath module (which is equivalent to os.path when running on windows) will work for all(1) paths on all platforms.Of course, if the file ends with a slash, the basename will be empty, so make your own function to deal with it:Verification:(1) There\'s one caveat: Linux filenames may contain backslashes. So on linux, r\'a/b\\c\' always refers to the file b\\c in the a folder, while on Windows, it always refers to the c file in the b subfolder of the a folder. So when both forward and backward slashes are used in a path, you need to know the associated platform to be able to interpret it correctly. In practice it\'s usually safe to assume it\'s a windows path since backslashes are seldom used in Linux filenames, but keep this in mind when you code so you don\'t create accidental security holes.Actually, there\'s a function that returns exactly what you wantos.path.split\nis the function you are looking forAssume p is the input string, tail is what you want.See python os module docs for detailIn your example you will also need to strip slash from right the right side to return c:Second level:update: I think lazyr has provided the right answer. My code will not work with windows-like paths on unix systems and vice versus with unix-like paths on windows system.this will return : paint.exechange the sep value of the split function regarding your path or OS.This is working for linux and windows as well with standard libraryResults:I have never seen double-backslashed paths, are they existing? The built-in feature of python module os fails for those. All others work, also the caveat given by you with os.path.normpath():The Windows separator can be in a Unix filename or Windows Path.  The Unix separator can only exist in the Unix path.  The presence of a Unix separator indicates a non-Windows path.The following will strip (cut trailing separator) by the OS specific separator, then split and return the rightmost value.   It\'s ugly, but simple based on the assumption above.   If the assumption is incorrect, please update and I will update this response to match the more accurate conditions.sample code:Maybe just my all in one solution without important some new(regard the tempfile for creating temporary files :D )Getting the values of abc.name will be a string like this: \'/tmp/tmpks5oksk7\'\nSo I can replace the / with a space .replace("/", " ") and then call split(). That will return a list and I get the\nlast element of the list with [-1]No need to get any module imported. best regards4k3nd0Here\'s a regex-only solution, which seems to work with any OS path on any OS.No other module is needed, and no preprocessing is needed either :The regex can be tested here.For completeness sake, here is the pathlib solution for python 3.2+:This works on both Windows and Linux.
