Been trying for hours to change Material\'s Floating Action Button color, but without success.I have tried to addor via codeorBut none of the above worked. I have also tried the solutions in the "duplicate question", but none of them works, button remained green and also became a square.I\'d like a detailed answer, thanks.P.S. It would be also nice to know how to add ripple effect, couldn\'t understand that either.As described in the documentation, by default it takes the color set in styles.xml attribute colorAccent.The background color of this view defaults to the your theme\'s colorAccent. If you wish to change this at runtime then you can do so via setBackgroundTintList(ColorStateList).If you wish to change the colorAs @Dantalian mentioned in the comments, if you wish to change the icon color, you can useVijet Badigannavar\'s answer is correct but using ColorStateList is usually complicated and he didn\'t tell us how to do it. Since we often focus on changing View\'s color in normal and pressed state, I\'m going to add more details:If you want to change FAB\'s color in normal state, you can just writeIf you want to change FAB\'s color in pressed state, thanks for Design Support Library 22.2.1, you can just writeBy setting this attribute, when you long-pressed the FAB, a ripple with your color will appear at your touch point and reveal into whole surface of FAB. Please notice that it won\'t change FAB\'s color in normal state. Below API 21(Lollipop), there is no ripple effect but FAB\'s color will still change when you\'re pressing it.Finally, if you want to implement more complex effect for states, then you should dig deeply into ColorStateList, here is a SO question discussing it: How do I create ColorStateList programmatically?.UPDATE:\nThanks for @Kaitlyn\'s comment. To remove stroke of FAB using backgroundTint as its color, you can set app:borderWidth="0dp" in your xml.As Vasil Valchev noted in a comment it is simpler than it looks, but there is a subtle difference that I wasn\'t noticing in my XML. Notice it is:and not if you try to change color of FAB by using app, there some problem.\nframe of button have different color, so what you must to do:and in code set the color:just use,dont use,The FAB is colored based on your colorAccent.The document suggests that it takes the @color/accent by default. But we can override it on code by usingAlso remember, The minimum API version to use this library is 15 so you need to update it! if you dont want to do it then you need to define a custom drawable and decorate it!Other solutions may work. This is the 10 pound gorilla approach that has the advantage of being broadly applicable in this and similar cases:Styles.xml:your layout xml:Note that you add colors  in res/values/color.xml\nand include the attribute in your fab Thanks to autocomplete. I got lucky after a few hit and trials:-- or -- (both are basically the same thing)This worked for me on API Version 17 with design library 23.1.0.I got the same problem and its all snatching my hair. Thanks for this\n https://stackoverflow.com/a/35697105/5228412What we can do..it works fine for me and wish for others who\'ll reach here.The point we are missing is that before you set the color on the button, it\'s important to work on the value you want for this color. So you can go to values > color. You will find the default ones, but you can also create colors by copping and pasting them, changing the colors and names. Then... when you go to change the color of the floating button (in activity_main),  you can choose the one you have created Exemple - code on values > colors with default colors + 3 more colors I\'ve created:Now my Floating Action Button with the color I\'ve created and named "corPar":It worked for me. Good Luck!If you are use Xamarin for android app development then use below code for changing floating button color. "#000000" used for black color you can changed according to your requriments.
