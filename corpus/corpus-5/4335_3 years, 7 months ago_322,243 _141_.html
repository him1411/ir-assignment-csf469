After I update my Docker version to 0.8.0, I get an error message while entering sudo docker version:And I\'ve followed the instructions and entered command sudo docker -d, and I got this:How do I solve the problem?In Linux:From Create a Docker group section, it is necessary to add the user to the docker group:Log out and log back in. This ensures your user is running with the correct permissions.In Mac OS X:As Dayel Ostraco says is necessary to add environments variables:The docker-machine start command outputs the comments to guide the process.If you are running Docker on OSÂ X, running the following eval has worked for me.If you\'d prefer not to have to run this eval statement on every terminal session, you can add this to your bash_profile:Be sure to restart the terminal session or run source on bash_profile for the changes to take effect.After a detailed investigation, this issue seems to happen every time after Mac OS X is rebooted (or the Docker virtual machine is restarted) which prevents the Docker client from connecting to the Docker daemon.To solve the issue, you can either:A) Reinstall Docker Toolbox using the official installer (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox), or simplyB) Run the following commands in order:C) Same as (B), you can also copy and paste the following line to run all of the three commands:In case you get the following error:just re-run the three commands another time, and it should work the second time.To run docker daemon on Linux (from CLI), try running:or example to initialize the "base" filesystem:or manually, e.g.:To install machine binaries on Linux, try:locally:global:On OS X the docker binary is only a client and you cannot use it to run the docker daemon, because Docker daemon uses Linux-specific kernel features, therefore you can\xe2\x80\x99t run Docker natively in OS X. So you have to install docker-machine in order to create VM and attach to it.Check if you\'ve docker-machine by:If not, install machine binary via:OS Xmanually:See: Docker - Mac OS X installationThen you need to create default machine (if you don\'t have one):Or check if already exists:Set-up the environment for the Docker client:Then double-check by listing containers:See: Get started with Docker Machine and a local VMThis usually happens when you are not in the docker group. You can add yourself to the docker group with:or After this you need to logout and log back in to the server.Alternatively you can sudo every Docker command.The best way to find out why Docker isn\'t working will be to run the daemon manually.The Docker daemon logs to STDOUT, so it will start spitting out whatever it\'s doing.Here was what my problem was:This was because the instance had been cloned from another virtual machine. I just had to remove the pidfile, and everything worked afterwards.Of course, instead of blindly assuming this will work, I\'d suggest running the daemon manually one more time and reviewing the log output for any other errors before starting the service back up.If all the other solutions above don\'t work you can try checking the ownership of /var/run/docker.sock:If you\'re not the owner then change ownership with the command:Then you can go ahead and try executing the Docker commands hassle-free :DIf you get the message Can\'t connect to docker daemon. Is \'docker -d\' running on this host?, you can check it by docker version.If you see the information like Docker Client is running. but Docker Server is not, it\'s obviously you need to start the Docker server.In CentOS, you can use service to start or stop the Docker server.Then, after you type docker version, you will get the information of Docker Client and Docker Server, and the Docker daemon has been started.I restart Docker after installing it:And it works.Do a ps aux | grep docker to see if the daemon is running. If not run /etc/init.d/docker startI have the same error and trying docker-machine regenerate-certs or eval.. did not work for me.This on OS X 10.11.3 (El Capitan) and Docker v1.10.1. I was able to fix it only by deleting and recreating docker-machine again. SourceIf running docker-machine ls, it shows you a similar output to the one below;DOCKERUnknownERRORSUnable to query docker version: Cannot\n  connect to the docker engine endpointTry removing your Docker machine with;Where default is your Docker machine name. Then;Creates a new Docker machine.Double check that everything looks normal now (no errors or unknown Docker) with:Finally don\'t forget to run "$(docker-machine env default)" before you continue or run the Docker Quickstart Terminal which does it for you...I have faced this problem, and I restarted Docker using these commands:But I did not solve my problem, because I forgot to execute my Docker commands without sudo. For those who faces this problem, try to check that.Tryinstead of this:Try adding the current user to docker group:Then log out and login.I had the same problem - "Can\'t connect to docker daemon." (except I didn\'t get any \'file not found\' errors on trying to start the server.)\'ps\' showed that "/usr/bin/docker -d" was still runningI realised that I\'d never actually succeeded in running the server myself though. Every attempt had produced So I belatedly realised that installing docker had maybe registered the daemon with upstart, which had started it for me. Hence, trying to kill the daemon to manually restart it fails (operation not permitted). So I did aon the daemon process. Another daemon immediately took its place, and this new one DOES now let my CLI client connect:I have similar problem. I had to logout and login again to shell because I have just installed Docker and following command didn\'t show in my environment.If you are running on OS X using Docker tool, follow this.Restart the daemon and configure your environment:And thenFinally,To test the daemon is running:docker ps -a or docker-machine ls. This will list all containers.I just had the same issue, running on Amazon AWS.Here\'s what I attempted:It was tested following on the remote machine:I removed /var/lib/docker and uninstalled everything, but there was no success after reinstallation. Unfortunately I have no logs stored from failures, but docker.service just refused to start.However, what finally solved my issue was basically:Following Docker\'s DOC site: Manage Docker as a non-root user1) Create Docker Group2) Make user belong to docker group to get the group\'s privileges.Check whether the DOCKER_HOST environment variable is set for your shell.If it exists,Then this should work: I got the same problem. In CentOS 6.5:If it shows no Docker daemon process exists, then I type:Then Ctrl + D to stop Docker. Because we use the -d option, Docker will run as daemon. Now we can do:Then I can do a docker pull centos. That\'s all.NOTE: If these do not work, you can try yum update, and then repeat these again, because I yum install before these.Check if you are using Docker Machine :)Run docker-machine env default should do the trick.Because according to documentation:Docker Machine is a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on\n  virtual hosts, and manage the hosts with docker-machine commands. You\n  can use Machine to create Docker hosts on your local Mac or Windows\n  box, on your company network, in your data center, or on cloud\n  providers like AWS or Digital Ocean.Using docker-machine commands, you can start, inspect, stop, and\n  restart a managed host, upgrade the Docker client and daemon, and\n  configure a Docker client to talk to your host.Point the Machine CLI at a running, managed host, and you can run\n  docker commands directly on that host. For example, run \n  docker-machine env default to point to a host called default, follow on-screen\n  instructions to complete env setup, and run docker ps, \n  docker run hello-world, and so forth.https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/To fix, you need to issue the following commands in the terminal. I\'ll explain each step:Now, if you want to simplify things and get more time, you can run my init script with the parameter installDocker:A reboot is optional, but I suggest you do it to be sure all runs smoothly.I had the same problem running Docker 1.10 on Ubuntu 14.04 and none of the given answers worked. For me, the fix was to specify the storage driver when running the Docker daemon.If regenerating TLS certificates doesn\'t workTry restarting the docker machine and setting the env variable:Check if the machine is running with:or alternatively This worked for me. However, if you still don\'t have the daemon up, Docker\'s troubleshooting page details a process for stopping, removing and creating a new machine. I also got the issue "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?".I had forgot to use sudo. Hope it will help some of us.Ok so I started having this problem today. Then I saw a lot of responses but none seem to have worked for me. First most of the instructions where directed to linux. And for the mac version they were all talking about running \'docker-machine\'. I assume you use docker-machine if you install docker toolbox because then docker will be running in a virtual machine for windows and mac platforms. But its 2017 now and docker for mac is really stable hence no need for using the toolbox.Not sure how the daemon stopped though. But to restart it all I had to do was go "Applications" and double click on the docker icon. I was asked to update and Relaunched which I accepted. After that everything worked like a charm.Try to change the Docker configuration file, docker or docker-network in /etc/sysconfig:(... ~ v1.17)or (v1.18):Have you tried turning it off and on again? :-)I had the same issue after upgrading to Docker 1.10.1 on my Mac.\nI did the following:On the Docker Quickstart Terminal$ exit$ exitthendocker-machine kill defaultthen restarted Docker Quickstart TerminalThis solved my problem.I had a similar issue. In my case the solution was to remove a deprecated version of docker. This I assume was causing some conflicts.On ubuntu:solved the problem for mePlease try on your ssh server:Step1 : systemctl start dockerStep 2 : systemctl status docker Docker will start running on your host and respective port.
