Using Moment.js I can\'t transform a correct moment object to a date object with timezones. I can\'t get the correct date.Example:Use this to transform a moment object into a date object:From http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/as-javascript-date/Yields:As long as you have initialized moment-timezone with the data for the zones you want, your code works as expected.You are correctly converting the moment to the time zone, which is reflected in the second line of output from momentObj.format().Switching to UTC doesn\'t just drop the offset, it changes back to the UTC time zone.  If you\'re going to do that, you don\'t need the original .tz() call at all.  You could just do moment.utc().Perhaps you are just trying to change the output format string?  If so, just specify the parameters you want to the format method:Regarding the last to lines of your code - when you go back to a Date object using toDate(), you are giving up the behavior of moment.js and going back to JavaScript\'s behavior.  A JavaScript Date object will always be printed in the local time zone of the computer it\'s running on.  There\'s nothing moment.js can do about that.A couple of other little things:While the moment constructor can take a Date, it is usually best to not use one.  For "now", don\'t use moment(new Date()).  Instead, just use moment().  Both will work but it\'s unnecessarily redundant.  If you are parsing from a string, pass that string directly into moment.  Don\'t try to parse it to a Date first.  You will find moment\'s parser to be much more reliable.Time Zones like MST7MDT are there for backwards compatibility reasons.  They stem from POSIX style time zones, and only a few of them are in the TZDB data. Unless absolutely necessary, you should use a key such as America/Denver..toDate did not really work for me, So, Here is what i did :hope this helpsI needed to have timezone information in my date string. I was originally using moment.tz(dateStr, \'America/New_York\').toString(); but then I started getting errors about feeding that string back into moment.I tried the moment.tz(dateStr, \'America/New_York\').toDate(); but then I lost timezone information which I needed.The only solution that returned a usable date string with timezone that could be fed back into moment was moment.tz(dateStr, \'America/New_York\').format();
