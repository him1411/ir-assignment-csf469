Saw the following error when running an npm install which required node-gyp.. but could be triggered by anything which requires xcode-selectxcode-select: error: tool \'xcodebuild\' requires Xcode, but active\n  developer directory \'/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\' is a command\n  line tools instanceThis problem happens when xcode-select developer directory was pointing to /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools, when a full regular XCode was required (happens when CLT are installed after XCode)Solution:Note: Make sure your Xcode app path is correct.Other solution for those who don\'t want to install Xcode:Install Command Line Tools (if you haven\'t already):xcode-select --installChange the active directory:sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineToolsThis worked for me (git).I was having an issue while trying to install packages using npm.\nI got the error: "sudo xcode-select -s /Applications//Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/"To fix this Now when installing packages with npm I no longer get errors.Xcode->Preferences->Locations->command line toolsSelect the option: Xcode 8.xJust in case you\'re using xcode beta:Install Xcode from App Store. After installing run xcodebuild with root privileges i.e. sudo xcodebuild and accept the language.
