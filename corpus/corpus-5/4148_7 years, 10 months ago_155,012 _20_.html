I\'m using the following command in my web application to find all files in the current directory that contain the string foo (leaving out svn directories).How do I find out the files that doesn\'t contain the word foo?If your grep has the -L (or --files-without-match) option:Please take a look at ack at http://beyondgrep.com/.  It does the .svn exclusion for you automatically, gives you Perl regexes, and is a simple download of a single Perl program.  The equivalent of what you\'re looking for should be, in ack:I used the following:Excludes the need for the find to filter out the svn folders by using a second grep.Finally I got it right using this as suggested by a friend:It gives me all the files that has zero match for foo :)I had good luck withMy attempts with grep -v just gave me all the lines without "foo" Your friend was "sort of" right.  You will actually need:Otherwise, you will get hits on files that have 10 lines w/ "foo", files that have 100 lines w/ "foo", etc. as well as lines that have a "0" in the filename like "my_10_best_friends.txt".My grep does not have any -L option. I do find workaround to achieve this.The ideas are :make the difference between the 2 dump file with diff command.find *20161109* -mtime -2|grep -vwE "(TRIGGER)"You can specify the filter under "find" and the exclusion string under "grep -vwE". Use mtime under find if you need to filter on modified time too.I am using Ubuntu,and I tried this command:\n\ncat file |grep -v "hehe"\n\nthis could help you to filter the lines including substring "hehe".orabove command will give us the result as -v finds the inverse of the pattern  being searched
