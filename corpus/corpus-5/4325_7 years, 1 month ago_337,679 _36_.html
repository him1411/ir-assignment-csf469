I have searched everywhere but I couldn\'t find my answer, is there a way to make an simple HTTP request? I want to request an PHP page / script on one of my website but I don\'t want to show the webpage.If possible I even want to do it in the background (in an BroadcastReceiver)UPDATEThis is a very old answer. I definitely won\'t recommend Apache\'s client anymore. Consider using HttpUrlConnection or OkHttp instead. UPDATEFirst of all, request a permission to access network, add following to your manifest:Then the easiest way is to use Apache http client bundled with Android:If you want it to run on separate thread I\'d recommend extending AsyncTask:You then can make a request by:unless you have an explicit reason to choose the Apache HttpClient, you should prefer java.net.URLConnection. you can find plenty of examples of how to use it on the web.we\'ve also improved the Android documentation since your original post: http://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/HttpURLConnection.htmland we\'ve talked about the trade-offs on the official blog: http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/09/androids-http-clients.htmlNote: The Apache HTTP Client bundled with Android is now deprecated in favor of HttpURLConnection. Please see the Android Developers Blog for more details.Add <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> to your manifest.You would then retrieve a web page like so:I also suggest running it on a separate thread: See the documentation for more information on response handling and POST requests.RegardsWith a thread:Look at this awesome new library which is available via gradle :)build.gradle: compile \'com.apptakk.http_request:http-request:0.1.2\'Usage:https://github.com/erf/http-requestI made this for a webservice to requerst on URL, using a Gson lib:Client:This is the new code for HTTP Get/POST request in android. HTTPClient is depricated and may not be available as it was in my case.Firstly add the two dependencies in build.gradle:Then write this code in ASyncTask in doBackground method.The most simple way is using the Android lib called VolleyVolley offers the following benefits:Automatic scheduling of network requests. Multiple concurrent network\n  connections. Transparent disk and memory response caching with\n  standard HTTP cache coherence. Support for request prioritization.\n  Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can\n  set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel. Ease of customization, for\n  example, for retry and backoff. Strong ordering that makes it easy to\n  correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the\n  network. Debugging and tracing tools.You can send a http/https request as simple as this:In this case, you needn\'t consider "running in the background" or "using cache" yourself as all of these has already been done by Volley.For me, the easiest way is using library called Retrofit2We just need to create an Interface that contain our request method, parameters, and also we can make custom header for each request :And the best is, we can do it asynchronously easily using enqueue method
