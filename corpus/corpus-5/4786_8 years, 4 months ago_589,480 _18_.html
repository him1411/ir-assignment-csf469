I have a table (SQL Sever) which references paths (UNC or otherwise), but now the path is going to change. In the path column, I have many records and I need to change just a portion of the path, but not the entire path. And I need to change the same string to the new one, in every record.How can I do this with a simple update?It\'s this easy:I tried the above but it did not yield the correct result. The following one does:Without the CAST function I got an error Argument data type ntext is invalid for argument 1 of replace function.where "ImagePath" is my column Name. "NewImagePath" is temporery\n  column Name insted of "ImagePath" "~/" is my current string.(old\n  string) "../" is my requried string.(new string)\n  "tblMyTable" is my table in database.You can use this query If target column type is other than varchar/nvarchar like text, we need to cast the column value as string and then convert it as:You also can replace large text for email template at run time, here is an simple example for that.all answers are great but I just want to give you a good example this SQL statement will replace the existence of the word "table"\n(second parameter) inside the given statement(first parameter) with the third parameter the initial value is this value from table but after executing replace function it will be this value from table but updatedand here is a real example for example if we have this valueit will becomehope this gives you better visualization
