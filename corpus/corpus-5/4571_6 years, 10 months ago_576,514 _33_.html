What is the correct format specifier for double in printf? Is it %f or is it %lf? I believe its %f but I am not sure.Code sample"%f" is the (or at least one) correct format for a double. There is no format for a float, because if you attempt to pass a float to printf, it\'ll be promoted to double before printf receives it1. "%lf" is also acceptable under the current standard -- the l is specified as having no effect if followed by the f conversion specifier (among others).Note that this is one place that printf format strings differ substantially from scanf (and fscanf, etc.) format strings. For output, you\'re passing a value, which will be promoted from float to double when passed as a variadic parameter. For input you\'re passing a pointer, which is not promoted, so you have to tell scanf whether you want to read a float or a double, so for scanf, %f means you want to read a float and %lf means you want to read a double (and, for what it\'s worth, for a long double, you use %Lf for either printf or scanf).\n1. C99, \xc2\xa76.5.2.2/6: "If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a prototype, the integer promotions are performed on each argument, and arguments that have type float are promoted to double. These are called the default argument promotions." In C++ the wording is somewhat different (e.g., it does use the word "prototype") but the effect is the same: all the variadic parameters undergo default promotions before they\'re received by the function.\nGiven the C99 standard (namely, the N1256 draft), the rules depend on the\nfunction kind: fprintf (printf, sprintf, ...) or scanf.Here are relevant parts extracted:ForewordThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, ISO/IEC 9899:1990, as amended and corrected by ISO/IEC 9899/COR1:1994, ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, and ISO/IEC 9899/COR2:1996.\n  Major changes from the previous edition include:7.19.6.1 The fprintf function7 The length modifiers and their meanings are:l (ell) Specifies that (...) has no effect on a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier.L Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier applies to a long double argument.The same rules specified for fprintf apply for printf, sprintf and similar functions.7.19.6.2 The fscanf function11 The length modifiers and their meanings are:l (ell) Specifies that (...) that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to double;L Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion\n  specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to long double.12 The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:\n       a,e,f,g Matches an optionally signed floating-point number, (...)14 The conversion specifiers A, E, F, G, and X are also valid and behave the same as, respectively, a, e, f, g, and x.The long story short, for fprintf the following specifiers and corresponding types are specified:and for fscanf it is:It can be %f, %g or %e depending on how you want the number to be formatted. See here for more details. The l modifier is required in scanf with double, but not in printf.%Lf (note the capital L) is the format specifier for long doubles.For plain doubles, either %e, %E, %f, %g or %G will do.The correct printf format for double is %lf, exactly as you used it. There\'s nothing wrong with your code.Format %lf in printf was not supported in old (pre-C99) versions of C language, which created superficial "inconsistency" between format specifiers for double in printf and scanf. That superficial inconsistency has been fixed in C99. So in modern C it makes perfect sense to prefer to use %f with float, %lf with double and %Lf with long double consistently in both printf and scanf.For double you can simply use %lf or you may use any of following as per your preference%e or %E for values in exponential format  %g or %G for either normal or exponential notation, whichever is more appropriate for its magnitude.
