I want to do something like:This should work fine:To add a filter - like \'trans\' - in the same tag use As Adam Elsodaney points out, you can also use string interpolation, this does require double quoted strings:Also a little known feature in Twig is string interpolation:In this case, where you want to output plain text and a variable, you could do it like this:If you want to concatenate some variables, alessandro1997\'s solution would be much better.The operator you are looking for is Tilde (~), like Alessandro said, and here it is in the documentation:~: Converts all operands into strings and concatenates them. {{ "Hello\n  " ~ name ~ "!" }} would return (assuming name is \'John\') Hello John!. â€“  http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html#other-operatorsAnd here is an example somewhere else in the docs:As you can see this works with filters and functions without needing to use set on a seperate line.Whenever you need to use a filter with a concatenated string (or a basic math operation) you should wrap it with ()\'s. Eg.:{{ (\'http://\' ~ app.request.host) | url_encode }}In Symfony you can use this for protocol and host:Though @alessandro1997 gave a perfect answer about concatenation.You can use ~ like {{ foo ~ \'inline string\' ~ bar.fieldName }}But you can also create your own concat function to use it like in your question:\n{{ concat(\'http://\', app.request.host) }}:In src/AppBundle/Twig/AppExtension.phpIn app/config/services.yml:example00 string concat bareexample01 string concat with intervening textfollows the same syntax as sprintf in other languagesTo mix strings, variables and translations I simply do the following:Despite everything being mixed up, it works like a charm.The "{{ ... }}"-delimiter can also be used within strings:
