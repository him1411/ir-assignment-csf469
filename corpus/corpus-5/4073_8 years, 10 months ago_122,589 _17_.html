What is the equivalent of /dev/null in Windows?I think you want NUL, at least within a command prompt or batch files.For example:doesn\'t create a file.(I believe the same is true if you try to create a file programmatically, but I haven\'t tried it.)In PowerShell, you want $null:According to this message on the GCC mailing list, you can use the file "nul" instead of /dev/null:(Credits to Danny for this code; copy-pasted from his message.)You can also use this special "nul" file through redirection.Jon Skeet is correct.  Here is the Nul Device Driver page in the Windows Embedded docs (i have no idea why its not somewhere else...)  HEre is another NUL in windows seems actully a virtual path in any folder.\nJust like .., . in any filesystem.use any folder followed with NUL will workex :have same effect as /dev/null in linuxtest on windows 7, 64 bitNUL works programmatically as well. E.g. the following:works as expected without creating a file. (MSVC++ 12.0)
