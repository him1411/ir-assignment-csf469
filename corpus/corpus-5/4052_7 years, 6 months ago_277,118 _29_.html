I\'m writing some data files in JSON format and would like to have some really long string values split over multiple lines. Using python\'s JSON module I get a whole lot of errors, whether I use \\ or \\n as an escape. Is it possible to have multi-line strings in JSON? It\'s mostly for visual comfort so I suppose I can just turn word wrap on in my editor, but I\'m just kinda curious...JSON does not allow real line-breaks. You need to replace all the line breaks into \\n.I have had to do this for a small Node.js project and found this work-around:This looks quite neat to me, appart from that I have to use double quotes everywhere. Though otherwise, I could, perhaps, use YAML, but that has other pitfalls and is not supported natively. Once parsed, I just use myData.modify_head.join(\'\\n\') or myData.modify_head.join(), depending upon whether I want a line break after each string or not.Check out the specification! The JSON grammar\'s char production can take the following values:Newlines are "control characters" so, no, you may not have a literal newline within your string. However you may encode it using whatever combination of \\n and \\r you require.This is a really old question, but I came across this on a search and I think I know the source of your problem.JSON does not allow "real" newlines in its data; it can only have escaped newlines. See the answer from @YOU, above. According to the question, it looks like you attempted to escape line breaks in Python two ways: by using the line continuation character ("\\") or by using "\\n" as an escape.But keep in mind: if you are using a string in python, special escaped characters ("\\t", "\\n") are translated into REAL control characters! The "\\n" will be replaced with the ASCII control character representing a newline character, which is precisely the character that is illegal in JSON. (As for the line continuation character, it simply takes the newline out.)So what you need to do is to prevent Python from escaping characters. You can do this by using a raw string (put r in front of the string, as in r"abc\\ndef", or by including an extra slash in front of the newline ("abc\\\\ndef").Both of the above will, instead of replacing "\\n" with the real newline ASCII control character, will leave "\\n" as two literal characters, which then JSON can interpret as a newline escape.JSON doesn\'t allow breaking lines for readability.Your best bet is to use an IDE that will line-wrap for you.Write property value as a array of strings. Like example given over here https://gun.io/blog/multi-line-strings-in-json/. This will help.We can always use array of strings for multiline strings like following.And we can easily iterate array to display content in multi line fashion.Use regex to replace all occurrences of \\r\\n with \\\\n.This worked for me in scala.{{name}}{{name1}}my.opt.push({\'name\':\'line1\',\'name1\':\'line2\') Is it possible to have multi-line strings in JSON?Yes. I just tested this now with my Firefox web browser by pressing F12, clicking console and typing at the bottom of the screen.The Javascript interpreter can convert an object containing multiline strings to JSON and parse it back again with no problem at all.write any text in notepad++ with multi multi line\nthen press ctl+a and ctl+j to arrange them in one line In json file write :put the multiline text on  txt file and then(it work\'s on  mongoDB)You can try place <div></div>between sentences.
