I understand that pandas is designed to load fully populated DataFrame but I need to create an empty DataFrame then add rows, one by one.\nWhat is the best way to do this ?I successfully created an empty DataFrame with :Then I can add a new row and fill a field with :It works but seems very odd :-/ (it fails for adding string value)How can I add a new row to my DataFrame (with different columns type) ?Example at @Nasser\'s answer:You could use pandas.concat() or DataFrame.append(). For details and examples, see Merge, join, and concatenate.You could create a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary corresponds to an input data row. Once the list is complete, then create a data frame. This is a much faster approach. I had a similar problem where if I created a data frame for each row and appended it to the main data frame it took 30 mins. On the other hand, if I used the below methodology, it was successful within seconds.If you know the number of entries ex ante, you should preallocate the space by also providing the index (taking the data example from a different answer):Speed comparisonAnd - as from the comments - with a size of 6000, the speed difference becomes even larger:Increasing the size of the array (12) and the number of rows (500) makes\n  the speed difference more striking: 313ms vs 2.29sFor efficient appending see How to add an extra row to a pandas dataframe and Setting With Enlargement.Add rows through loc/ix on non existing key index data. e.g. :Or:You can append a single row as a dictionary using the ignore_index option.This is not an answer to the OP question but a toy example to illustrate the answer of @ShikharDua above which I found very useful. While this fragment is trivial, in the actual data I had 1,000s of rows, and many columns, and I wished to be able to group by different columns and then perform the stats below for more than one taget column. So having a reliable method for building the data frame one row at a time was a great convenience. Thank you @ShikharDua ! For the sake of Pythonic way, here add my answer:Create a new record(data frame) and add to old_data_frame.\npass list of values and corresponding column names to create a new_record (data_frame)Another way to do it (probably not very performant):You can also enhance the DataFrame class like this:Make it simple. By taking list as input which will be appended as row in data-frame:-
