I am writing an Angular 2 application, and I have an HTML response I want to display. How do I do that? If I simply use the binding syntax {{myVal}} it encodes all HTML characters (of course).I need somehow to bind the inner html of a div to the variable value.Thanks!The correct syntax is now the following:Working in \n4.4.2Documentation Reference[innerHtml] is great option in most cases, but it fails with really large strings or when you need hard-coded styling in html.I would like to share other approach:All you need to do, is to create a div in your html file and give it some id:Then, in your Angular 2 component, create reference to this object (TypeScript here):Then simply use loadData function to append some text to html element.It\'s just a way that you would do it using native javascript, but in Angular environment. I don\'t recommend it, because makes code more messy, but sometimes there is no other option.See also Angular 2 - innerHTML stylingAngular 2.0.0 and Angular 4.0.0 finalFor safe content justDOMSanitizerPotential unsafe HTML needs to be explicitly marked as trusted using Angulars DOM sanitizer so doesn\'t strip potentially unsafe parts of the content with a pipe likeSee also In RC.1 some styles can't be added using binding syntaxAnd docs: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/platform-browser/index/DomSanitizer-class.htmlAngular markupTo add HTML that contains Angular-specific markup (property or value binding, components, directives, pipes, ...) it is required to add the dynamic module and compile components at runtime.\nThis answer provides more details How can I use/create dynamic template to compile dynamic Component with Angular 2.0?On angular2@2.0.0-alpha.44:Html-Binding will not work when using an {{interpolation}}, use an "Expression" instead:invalid-> throws an error (Interpolation instead of expected Expression)correct-> this is the correct way.you may add additional elements to the expression, like:hintHTML added using [innerHTML] (or added dynamically by other means like element.appenChild() or similar) won\'t be processed by Angular in any way except sanitization for security purposed.\nSuch things work only when the HTML is added statically to a components template. If you need this, you can create a component at runtime like explained in How can I use/create dynamic template to compile dynamic Component with Angular 2.0?This works for me: <div innerHTML = "{{ myVal }}"></div> (Angular2, Alpha 33)According to another SO: Inserting HTML from server into DOM with angular2 (general DOM manipulation in Angular2), "inner-html" is equivalent to "ng-bind-html" in Angular 1.XUsing [innerHTML] directly without using Angular\'s DOM sanitizer is not an option if it contains user-created content. The safeHtml pipe suggested by @G\xc3\xbcnterZ\xc3\xb6chbauer in his answer is one way of sanitizing the content. The following directive is another one:To be usedJust to make for a complete answer, if your html content is in a component variable, you could also use:I apologize if I am missing the point here, but I would like to recommend a different approach:I think it\'s better to return raw data from your server side application and bind it to a template on the client side. This makes for more nimble requests since you\'re only returning json from your server. To me it doesn\'t seem like it makes sense to use Angular if all you\'re doing is fetching html from the server and injecting it "as is" into the DOM.I know Angular 1.x has an html binding, but I have not seen a counterpart in Angular 2.0 yet. They might add it later though. Anyway, I would still consider a data api for your Angular 2.0 app.I have a few samples here with some simple data binding if you are interested: http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/viewarticle/angular-2.0-examplesWorking in AngularJS v2.1.1In Angular 2 you can do 3 types of bindings:An expression can be a value, an attribute or a method. For example: \'4\', \'controller.var\', \'getValue()\'Example hereThe below code will help you myval you can replace with the desired htmlJust simply use [innerHTML] attribute in your HTML, something like this below:Ever had properties in your component that contain some html markup or\n  entities that you need to display in your template? The traditional\n  interpolation won\'t work, but the innerHTML property binding comes to\n  the rescue.Using {{myVal}} Does NOT work as expected! This won\'t pick up the HTML tags like <p>, <strong> etc and pass it only as strings...Imagine you have this code in your component: const myVal:string =\'<strong>Stackoverflow</strong> is <em>helpful!</em>\'If you use {{myVal}}, you will get this in the view:but using [innerHTML]="myVal"makes the result as expected like this:Stackoverflow is helpful!If you have templates in your angular (or whatever framework) application, and you return HTML templates from your backend through a HTTP request/response, you are mixing up templates between the frontend and the backend.Why not just leave the templating stuff either in the frontend (i would suggest that), or in the backend (pretty intransparent imo)?And if you keep templates in the frontend, why not just respond with JSON for requests to the backend. You do not even have to implement a RESTful structure, but keeping templates on one side makes your code more transparent.This will pay back when someone else has to cope with your code (or even you yourself are re-entering your own code after a while)!If you do it right, you will have small components with small templates, and best of all, if your code is imba, someone who doesn\'t know coding languages will be able to understand your templates and your logic! So additionally, keep your functions/methods as small you can.\nYou will eventually find out that maintaining, refactoring, reviewing, and adding features will be much easier compared to large functions/methods/classes and mixing up templating and logic between the frontend and the backend - and keep as much of the logic in the backend if your frontend needs to be more flexible (e.g. writing an android frontend or switching to a different frontend framework).Philosophy, man :)p.s.: you do not have to implement 100% clean code, because it is very expensive - especially if you have to motivate team members ;)\nbut: you should find a good balance between an approach to cleaner code and what you have (maybe it is already pretty clean)check the book if you can and let it enter your soul:\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Codetry this code your string with html tag like below you can get the string in html page The way to dynamically add elements to DOM, as explained on Angular 2 doc, is by using ViewContainerRef class from @Angular/core.What you have to do is to declare a directive that will implement ViewContainerRef and act like a placeholder on your DOM.DirectiveThen, in the template where you want to inject the component:HTMLThen, from the injected component code, you will inject the component containing the HTML you want:I added a fully working demo app on Angular 2 dynamically add component to DOM demo
