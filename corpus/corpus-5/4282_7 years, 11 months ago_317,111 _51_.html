I have a TextView and I\'d like to add a black border along its top and bottom borders.  I tried adding android:drawableTop and android:drawableBottom to the TextView, but that only caused the entire view to become black.Is there a way to easily add a top and bottom border to a View (in particular, a TextView) in Android?In android 2.2 you could do the following. Create an xml drawable such as /res/drawable/textlines.xml and assign this as a TextView\'s background property. /res/drawable/textlines.xmlThe down side to this is that you have to specify an opaque background colour, as transparencies won\'t work. (At least i thought they did but i was mistaken). In the above example you can see that the solid colour of the first shape #FFdddddd is copied in the 2nd shapes stroke colour.I\'ve used a trick so that the border is displayed outside the container. With this trick only a line is drawn so the background will be shown of the underlying view.This is the simplest option if you want a border around a layout or view in which you can set the background. Create an XML file in the drawable folder that looks something like this:You can remove the solid if you don\'t want a fill. The set background="@drawable/your_shape_drawable" on your layout/view.Here\'s a little trick I\'ve used in a RelativeLayout. Basically you have a black square under the view you want to give a border, and then give that view some padding (not margin!) so the black square shows through at the edges.Obviously this only works properly if the view doesn\'t have any transparent areas. If it does I would recommend you write a custom BorderView which only draws the border - it should only be a few dozen lines of code.If you\'re wondering, it does work with adjustViewBounds=true. However, it doesn\'t work if you want to have a background in an entire RelativeLayout, because there is a bug that stops you filling a RelativeLayout with a View. In that case I\'d recommend the Shape drawable.A final option is to use a 9-patch drawable like this one:You can use it on any view where you can set android:background="@drawable/...". And yes it does need to be 6x6 - I tried 5x5 and it didn\'t work.The disadvantage of this method is you can\'t change the colours very easily, but if you want fancy borders (e.g. only a border at the top and bottom, as in this question) then you may not be able to do them with the Shape drawable, which isn\'t very powerful.I forgot to mention this really simple option if you only want borders above and below your view. You can put your view in a vertical LinearLayout (if it isn\'t already) and then add empty Views above and below it like this:To add a 1dp white border at the bottom only and to have a transparent background you can use the following which is simpler than most answers here.For the TextView or other view add:And in the drawable directory add the following XML, called borderbottom.xmlIf you want a border at the top, change the android:top="-2dp" to android:bottom="-2dp"The colour does not need to be white and the background does not need to be transparent either.Basically, this XML will create a border using the rectangle shape, but then pushes the top, right and left sides beyond the render area for the shape. This leaves just the bottom border visible.So I wanted to do something slightly different: a border on the bottom ONLY, to simulate a ListView divider. I modified Piet Delport\'s answer and got this:Note using px instead of dp to get exactly 1 pixel divider (some phone DPIs will make a 1dp line disappear).The currently accepted answer doesn\'t work. It creates thin vertical borders on the left and right sides of the view as a result of anti-aliasing.This version works perfectly. It also allows you to set the border widths independently, and you can also add borders on the left / right sides if you want. The only drawback is that it does NOT support transparency.Create an xml drawable named /res/drawable/top_bottom_borders.xml with the code below and assign it as a TextView\'s background property. Tested on Android KitKat through MarshmallowYou can also wrap the view in a FrameLayout, then set the frame\'s background color and padding to what you want; however, the textview, by default has a \'transparent\' background, so you\'d need to change the textview\'s background color too.Just as @Nic Hubbard said, there is a very easy way to add a border line.You can change the height and background color to whatever you want.My answers is based on @Emile version but I use transparent color instead of solid.\nThis example will draw a 2dp bottom border.@color/bgcolor is the color of the background on wich you draw your view with border.If you want to change the position of the border change the offset with one of:or combine them to have 2 or more borders:Why not just create a 1dp high view with a background color? Then it can be easily placed where you want.First make a xml file with contents shown below and name it border.xml and place it inside the layout folder inside the res directoryAfter that inside the code useThis will make a black line on top and bottom of the TextView.write down below codeJust to add my solution to the list..I wanted a semi transparent bottom border that extends past the original shape (So the semi-transparent border was outside the parent rectangle).Which gives me;To change this:I prefer this approach in "drawable/top_bottom_border.xml": This only makes the borders, not a rectangle that will appear if your background has a color.Try wrapping the image with a linearlayout, and set it\'s background to the border color you want around the text.  Then set the padding on the textview to be the thickness you want for your border.You can also use a 9-path to do your job. Create it so that colored pixel do not multiply in height but only the transparent pixel.Just Add this TextView below the text where you want to add the border
