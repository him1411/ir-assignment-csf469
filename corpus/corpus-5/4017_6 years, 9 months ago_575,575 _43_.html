What\'s the correct way to round a PHP string to 2 decimal places?Output is "520.00";How function round_to_2dp()  definition should be?You can use number_format():Example:This function returns a string.Alternatively,Use round() (use if you are expecting number in float format only, else use number_format() as answer given by Codemwnci ):From the manual:Returns the rounded value of val to specified precision (number of digits after the decimal point). precision can also be negative or zero (default)....Try:The output will be:http://php.net/manual/en/function.round.phpe.g.Use PHP number_format() function.You can use php printf or sprintf functions:example with sprintf:You can run same without echo as well, ex: sprintf("%.3f",$num);output:Alternatively, with printf:output:I make my own.round_to_2dp is an user defined function, nothing can be done unless you posted the declaration of that functionHowever, my guess is doing this number_format($number,2);This will give you 2 number after decimal.It will return 5.98 without rounding the number.The rounding correctly rounds the number and the sprintf forces it to 2 decimal places if it happens to to be only 1 decimal place after rounding.this will display exactly two digit after decimal.   Advantage:\nIf you want to display two digit after float value only and not for int then use this.Another more exotic way to solve this issue is to use bcadd() with a dummy value for the $right_operand of 0.Number without roundIf you want to use 2 decimal digit in your entire project you can defineThen the following function will produce your desired resultBut if you don\'t use bcscale function you need to write the code as follow to get your desire resultTo know more http://php.net/manual/en/ref.bc.php http://php.net/manual/en/function.bcscale.phpHere I getting 2 decimal after .(dot) using function..Results from the above function:New Correct AnswerUse the PHP native function bcdivYou can use PHP round() function.
