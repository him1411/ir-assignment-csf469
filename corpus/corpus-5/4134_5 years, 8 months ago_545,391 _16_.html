I am using this code to convert a Set to a List:I want to avoid creating a new list in each iteration of the loop. Is that possible?You can use the List.addAll() method. It accepts a Collection as an argument, and your set is a Collection.EDIT: as respond to the edit of the question.\nIt is easy to see that if you want to have a Map with Lists as values, in order to have k different values, you need to create k different lists.\nThus: You cannot avoid creating these lists at all, the lists will have to be created.Possible work around:\nDeclare your Map as a Map<String,Set> or Map<String,Collection> instead, and just insert your set.Use constructor to convert it:Also from Guava Collect library, you can use newArrayList(Collection):This would be very similar to the previous answer from amit, except that you do not need to declare (or instanciate) any list object.We can use following one liner in Java 8:Here is one small example:I would do :You could use this one line change: Arrays.asList(set.toArray(new Object[set.size()]))recently i found thisI create simple static method:... or if you want to set type of List you can use:I found this working fine and useful to create a List from a Set.
