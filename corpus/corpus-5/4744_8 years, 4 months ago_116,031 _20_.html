I have often encountered an error such as "cannot convert from \'method group\' to \'string\'" in cases like: of course there was a typo in the last line because I forgot the invocation parentheses after ToString. The correct form would be:However I came to wonder what is a method group. Google isn\'t much of a help nor MSDN.A method group is the name for a set of methods (that might be just one) - i.e. in theory the ToString method may have multiple overloads (plus any extension methods): ToString(), ToString(string format), etc - hence ToString by itself is a "method group".It can usually convert a method group to a (typed) delegate by using overload resolution - but not to a string etc; it doesn\'t make sense.Once you add parentheses, again; overload resolution kicks in and you have unambiguously identified a method call.Also, if you are using LINQ, you can apparently do something like myList.Select(methodGroup).So, for example, I have:Instead of explicitly stating the variable to be used like this:I can just omit the name of the var:The ToString function has many overloads - the method group would be the group consisting of all the different overloads for that function.The first result in your MSDN search said:The method group identifies the one\n  method to invoke or the set of\n  overloaded methods from which to\n  choose a specific method to invokemy understanding is that basically because when you just write someInteger.ToString, it may refer to:or it can refer to:so it is called a method group.You can cast a method group into a delegate.The delegate signature selects 1 method out of the group.This example picks the ToString() overload which takes a string parameter:This example picks the ToString() overload which takes no parameters:
