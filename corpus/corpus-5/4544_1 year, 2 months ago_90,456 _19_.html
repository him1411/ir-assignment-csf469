I sometimes get this message in the logs of Xcode 8b3 when running my app, everything seems to work, but I\'d like to know where this comes from. Google did not help at all.in your Xcode:It comes from +[UIWindow _synchronizeDrawingAcrossProcessesOverPort:withPreCommitHandler:] via os_log API. It doesn\'t depend from another components/frameworks that you are using(only from UIKit) - it reproduces in clean single view application project on changing interface orientation.This method consists from 2 parts:When second part fails (looks like prohibited transition), it prints message above to error log.\nHowever, I think that this problem is not fatal: there are 2 additional assert cases in this method, that will lead to crash in debug.Seems that radar is the best we can do.Try putting the following in the environment variables for the scheme under run(debug)The "IOS_ACTIVITY_MODE = disable" answer turns off ALL logging!  Just close the logging view if you don\'t want to see the log.  Really ridiculous answer, amazing that it has so many votes!  Does nothing to address the actual message.Our apps that heavily use core data work fine, these messages and others started appearing after one of the last Xcode updates. Sad that Apple can\'t resolve these type of issues.We can mute it in this way (device and simulator need different values):Add the Name OS_ACTIVITY_MODE and the Value ${DEBUG_ACTIVITY_MODE} and check it (in Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme -> Run -> Arguments -> Environment).Add User-Defined Setting DEBUG_ACTIVITY_MODE, then add Any iOS Simulator SDK for Debug and set it\'s value to disable (in Project -> Build settings -> + -> User-Defined Setting)To fix, I deleted the app from Simulator.I also ran Clean first.I do not think anything orientation-related triggered it. The biggest thing that changed before this symptom started is that a Swift framework started calling NSLog on worker threads instead of main thread.This will also disable the ability to debug in real devices (no console output from real devices from then on).
