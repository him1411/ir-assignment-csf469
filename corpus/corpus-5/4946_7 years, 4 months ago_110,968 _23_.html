I have a very simple UIWebView with content from my application bundle. I would like any links in the web view to open in Safari instead of in the web view. Is this possible?Add this to the UIWebView delegate:(edited to check for navigation type. you could also pass through file:// requests which would be relative links)Swift Version:Swift 3 version:UpdateAs openURL has been deprecated in iOS 10:If anyone wonders, Drawnonward\'s solution would look like this in Swift:One quick comment to user306253\'s answer: caution with this, when you try to load something in the UIWebView yourself (i.e. even from the code), this method will prevent it to happened.What you can do to prevent this (thanks Wade) is:You might also want to handle the UIWebViewNavigationTypeFormSubmitted and UIWebViewNavigationTypeFormResubmitted types.The other answers have one problem: they rely on the action you do and not on the link itself to decide whether to load it in Safari or in webview. Now sometimes this is exactly what you want, which is fine; but some other times, especially if you have anchor links in your page, you want really to open only external links in Safari, and not internal ones. In that case you should check the URL.host property of your request. I use that piece of code to check whether I have a hostname in the URL that is being parsed, or if it is embedded html: You can of course adapt the regular expression to fit your needs. In Swift you can use the following code:Make sure you check for the URL value and the navigationType.Here\'s the Xamarin iOS equivalent of drawnonward\'s answer.In my case I want to make sure that absolutely everything in the web view opens Safari except the initial load and so I use...The accepted answer does not work. If your page loads URLs via Javascript, the navigationType will be UIWebViewNavigationTypeOther. Which, unfortunately, also includes background page loads such as analytics.To detect page navigation, you need to compare the [request URL] to the [request mainDocumentURL].This solution will work in all cases:
