I have to create an "Expires" value 5 minutes in the future, but I have to supply it in UNIX Timestamp format.  I have this so far, but it seems like a hack.Is there a module or function that does the timestamp conversion for me?Another way is to use calendar.timegm:It\'s also more portable than %s flag to strftime (which doesn\'t work on Windows).Now in Python >= 3.3 you can just call the timestamp() method to get the timestamp as a float.Just found this, and its even shorter.This is what you need:You can use datetime.strftime to get the time in Epoch form, using the %s format string:Here\'s a less broken datetime-based solution to convert from datetime object to posix timestamp:See more details at Converting datetime.date to UTC timestamp in Python.The key is to ensure all the dates you are using are in the utc timezone before you start converting. See http://pytz.sourceforge.net/ to learn how to do that properly. By normalizing to utc, you eliminate the ambiguity of daylight savings transitions. Then you can safely use timedelta to calculate distance from the unix epoch, and then convert to seconds or milliseconds.Note that the resulting unix timestamp is itself in the UTC timezone. If you wish to see the timestamp in a localized timezone, you will need to make another conversion.Also note that this will only work for dates after 1970.The following is based on the answers above (plus a correction for the milliseconds) and emulates datetime.timestamp() for Python 3 before 3.3 when timezones are used.To strictly answer the question as asked, you\'d want:datetime_timestamp is part of simple-date.  But if you were using that package you\'d probably type:which handles many more formats / types for my_datetime.Note that solutions with timedelta.total_seconds() work on python-2.7+.\nUse calendar.timegm(future.utctimetuple()) for lower versions of Python.
