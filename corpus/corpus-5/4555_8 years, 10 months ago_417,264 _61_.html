Using MSSQL2005, can I truncate a table with a foreign key constraint if I first truncate the child table (the table with the primary key of the FK relationship)?I know that I can eitherI thought that as long as I truncated the child table before the parent, I\'d be okay without doing either of the options above, but I\'m getting this error:Cannot truncate table \'TableName\' because it is being referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.Correct; you cannot truncate a table which has an FK constraint on it.Typically my process for this is:(All in a transaction, of course.)Of course, this only applies if the child has already been truncated. Otherwise I go a different route, dependent entirely on what my data looks like. (Too many variables to get into here.)The original poster determined WHY this is the case; see this answer for more details.Because TRUNCATE TABLE is a DDL command, it cannot check to see whether the records in the table are being referenced by a record in the child table.This is why DELETE works and TRUNCATE TABLE doesn\'t: because the database is able to make sure that it isn\'t being referenced by another record.Without ALTER TABLEhttps://github.com/reduardo7/TableTruncateThe solution @denver_citizen provided above did not work for me, but I liked the spirit of it so I modified a few things :For the benefit of the public here is the updated script :use the following command after deletion of all rows in that table by using delete statementEDIT: Corrected syntax for SQL Serveryou can follow this step,\nBy reseeding table you can delete the data of the table.if some error comes then you have to reseed the primary table.Here is a script I wrote in order to automate the process. I hope it helps.Found elsewhere on the webWell, since I did not find examples of the very simple solution I used, which is:Here it goes:1) Find the foreign key name that is causing the failure (for example: FK_PROBLEM_REASON, with field ID, from table TABLE_OWNING_CONSTRAINT)\n2) Remove that key from the table:3) Truncate wanted table4) Re-add the key to that first table:That\'s it.If I understand correctly, what you want to do is to have a clean environment to be set up for DB involving integration tests.My approach here would be to drop the whole schema and recreate it later. You cannot truncate a table if you don\'t drop the constraints. A disable also doesn\'t work. you need to Drop everything. i\'ve made a script that drop all constrainsts and then recreate then.Be sure to wrap it in a transaction ;)truncate did not work for me, delete + reseed is the best way out.\nIn case there are some of you out there who need to iterate over huge number of tables to perform delete + reseed, you might run into issues with some tables which does not have an identity column, the following code checks if identity column exist before attempting to reseedThe following works for me even with FK constraints, and combines the following answers to only drop the specified tables:Note:I think it still helps to declare the tables in the order you want them deleted (i.e. kill dependencies first).  As seen in this answer, rather than loop specific names you could substitute all tables withIt\'s my solution of this issue. I used it for altering PK, but idea the same. Hope this will be useful)If none of these answers worked like in my case do this:Good luck!For MS SQL, at least the newer versions, you can just disable the constrains with code like this:In SSMS I had Diagram open showing the Key.   After deleting the Key and truncating the file I refreshed then focused back on the Diagram and created an update by clearing then restoring an Identity box.   Saving the Diagram brought up a Save dialog box, than a "Changes were made in the database while you where working" dialog box, clicking Yes restored the Key, restoring it from the latched copy in the Diagram.  If you\'re doing this at any sort of a frequency, heck even on a schedule, I would absolutely, unequivocally never use a DML statement. The cost of writing to the transaction log is just to high, and setting the entire database into SIMPLE recovery mode to truncate one table is ridiculous.The best way, is unfortunately the hard or laborious way. That being:My process for doing this involves the following steps:Scripts of this nature should be done within a begin tran and commit tran block.I write the following ways and tried to parameterized them, so you can Run them in a Query document Or Make a useful SP with them easily.If your table has not millions of records this works good and hasn\'t any Alter commands:If your table has millions of records or you hasn\'t any problem with Alter command in your codes, then use this one:In above answer of mine the method of resolve the mentioned problem in the question is based on @LauroWolffValenteSobrinho answer.If you have more than one CONSTRAINT then you should append its codes like me to the above queryAlso you can change the above code base @SerjSagan answer to disable an enable the constraintSET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0; truncate table "tableName";SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;You could try DELETE FROM <your table >;.The server will show you the name of the restriction and the table, and deleting that table you can delete what you need.I have just found that you can use TRUNCATE table on a parent table with foreign key constraints on a child as long as you DISABLE the constraints on the child table first.\nE.g.Foreign key CONSTRAINT child_par_ref on child table, references PARENT_TABLEThe easiest way:\n1 - Enter in phpmyadmin\n2 - Click on table name in left column\n3 - Click in Operation (top menu)\n4 - Click "Empty the table (TRUNCATE)\n5 - Disable box "Enable foreign key checks"\n6 - Done!Link to image tutorial\nTutorial: http://www.imageno.com/wz6gv1wuqajrpic.html\n\n(sorry, I don\'t have enough reputation to upload images here :P)reference - truncate foreign key constrained tableWorking for me in MYSQL
