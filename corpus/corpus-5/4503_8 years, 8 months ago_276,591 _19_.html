I am looking for a way to get the output of a command when it is run from within a C++ program.  I have looked at using the system() function, but that will just execute a command.  Here\'s an example of what I\'m looking for:I need to run an arbitrary command and get it\'s output.  I\'ve looked at Boost.org but I have not found anything that will give me what I need.Pre-C++11 version:Replace popen and pclose with _popen and _pclose for Windows.Getting both stdout and stderr (and also writing to stdin, not shown here) is easy peasy with my pstreams header, which defines iostream classes that work like popen:I\'d use popen() (++waqas).But sometimes you need reading and writing...Seems like nobody does things the hard way any more.(Assuming a Unix/Linux/Mac environment, or perhaps Windows with a POSIX compatibility layer...)You also might want to play around with select() and non-blocking reads.For Windows popen also works, but it opens up console window - which quickly flashes over your UI application. If you want to be a professional, it\'s better to disable this "flashing" (Especially if end-user can cancel it).So here is my own version for Windows:(This code partially recombined from ideas written in codeproject and MSDN samples)Two possible approaches.1/ I don\'t think popen() is part of the C++ standard (it\'s part of POSIX from memory) but it\'s available on every UNIX I\'ve worked with (and you seem to be targeting UNIX since your command is "./some_command").2/ On the off-chance that there is no popen(), you can use system( "./some_command >/tmp/some_command.out" ) ; then use the normal I/O functions to process the output file.You can use the library Boost.Process. It\'s not officially part of boost though. I\'ve have seen it working nicely for others. Unfortunately, boost.process progress apparently has been stalled. pstreams is another (apparently active) project. Certainly worth a try i would say - but it\'s only for posix compatible operation systems.This might be a portable solution.  Follows standards.I couldn\'t figure out why popen/pclose is missing from Codeblocks/MinGW.  So I worked around the problem by using CreateProcess() and CreatePipe() instead.  Here\'s the solution that worked for me:
