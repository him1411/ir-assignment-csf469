I have a database called foo and a database called bar. I have a table in foo called tblFoobar that I want to move (data and all) to database bar from database foo. What is the SQL statement to do this?On SQL Server? and on the same database server? Use three part naming.This just moves the data.  If you want to move the table definition (and other attributes such as permissions and indexes), you\'ll have to do something else.SQL Server Management Studio\'s "Import Data" task (right-click on the DB name, then tasks) will do most of this for you.  Run it from the database you want to copy the data into.If the tables don\'t exist it will create them for you, but you\'ll probably have to recreate any indexes and such.  If the tables do exist, it will append the new data by default but you can adjust that (edit mappings) so it will delete all existing data.I use this all the time and it works fairly well.This should work:It will not copy constaints, defaults or indexes. The table created will not have a clustered index.Alternatively you could:  If your destination table exists and is empty. If it\xe2\x80\x99s one table only then all you need to do is One thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to consider is other updates such as migrating other objects in the future. Note that your source and destination tables do not have the same name. This means that you\xe2\x80\x99ll also have to make changes if you dependent objects such as views, stored procedures and other. Whit one or several objects you can go manually w/o any issues. However, when there are more than just a few updates 3rd party comparison tools come in very handy.  Right now I\xe2\x80\x99m using ApexSQL Diff for schema migrations but you can\xe2\x80\x99t go wrong with any other tool out there.Script the create table in management studio, run that script in bar to create the table. (Right click table in object explorer, script table as, create to...)INSERT bar.[schema].table SELECT * FROM foo.[schema].tableYou can also use the Generate SQL Server Scripts Wizard to help guide the creation of SQL script\'s that can do the following:   Good example workflow for SQL Server 2008 with screen shots shown here.   You may go with this way: ( a general example )Also if you need to generate the column names as well to put in insert clause, use:Copy the result and paste into query window to represent your table column names and even this will exclude the identity column as well:Remember the script to copy rows will work iff the databases belongs to the same location.You can Try This.Server name is optional if both DB is in same server.If there is existing table and we wants to copy only data,\nwe can try this query.insert into Destination_Existing_Tbl select col1,col2 FROM Source_TblCopy Data
