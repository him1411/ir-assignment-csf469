When converting a project to use ARC what does "switch case is in protected scope" mean?\nI am converting a project to use ARC, using Xcode 4 Edit -> Refactor -> Convert to Objective-C ARC... \nOne of the errors I get is "switch case is in protected scope" on "some" of the switches in a switch case.Edit,\nHere is the code:the ERROR is marked on the "default" case:Surround each case itself with braces {}. That should fix the issue (it did for me in one of my projects). Hard to be sure without looking at the code, but it probably means there\'s some variable declaration going on inside the switch and the compiler can\'t tell if there\'s a clear path to the required dealloc point.There are 2 easy ways to solve this issue:The compiler can not calculate the code line when the variables are to be released.\nCausing this error. For me, the problem started on the middle of a switch and curly brackets did not worked out, unless you have to include {} IN ALL previous case statements. For me the error came when I had the statementin the previous case. After I deleted this, then all subsequent case statement came clean from the protected scope error messageBefore:I moved NSDate definition before switch, and it fixed the compile problem:Declare the variables outside the switch, then instantiate them inside the case.\nThat worked perfectly for me using Xcode 6.2Note: Check! The syntax of the bold & italicized line. Rectify it and you are good to go.Surround with braces {} the code between the case statement and the break in each case.\nIt worked on my code.
