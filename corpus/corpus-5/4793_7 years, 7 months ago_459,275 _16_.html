How can I get the position of a character inside a string in python?There are two string methods for this, find and index.Example:The difference is that find returns -1 when what you\'re looking for isn\'t found. index throws an exception.Function str.find(sub[, start[, end]])\n  Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found, such that sub is contained in the range [start, end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 if sub is not found. And:Function str.index(sub[, start[, end]])\n  Like find(), but raise ValueError when the substring is not found.Just for a sake of completeness, if you need to find all positions of a substring in a string, you can do the following:which will return [4, 9]"Long winded" wayto get substring, What happens when the string contains a duplicate character?\nfrom my experience with index() I saw that for duplicate you get back the same index.For example:would return:In that case you can do something like that:Perhaps you\'d like to have a look at the documentation to find out what the difference between the two is.
