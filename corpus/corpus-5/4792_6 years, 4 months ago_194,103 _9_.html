Is it possible to set a transparency or alpha level on SVG fill colours?I\'ve tried adding two values to the fill tag (changing it from fill="#044B94" to fill="#044B9466"), but this doesn\'t work.You use an addtional attribute; fill-opacity: This attribute takes a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive; where 0.0 is completely transparent.For example:Additionally you have the following:As a not yet fully standardized solution (though in alignment with the color syntax in CSS3) you can use e.g fill="rgba(124,240,10,0.5)". Works fine in Firefox, Opera, Chrome.Here\'s an example.This is an RGBA color inside the SVG, defined with hex values.As of August 2017: RGBA fill colors display properly on Mozilla Firefox (54), Apple Safari (10.1) and Mac OS X Finder\'s "Quick View". However Google Chrome (60.0) does not display this color properly; it will just display it as black.
