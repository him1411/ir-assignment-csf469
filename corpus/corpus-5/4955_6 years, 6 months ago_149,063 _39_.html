There is an entity type called product that is generated by entity framework.\nI have writen this queryThe code below throws the following error : "The entity or complex type Shop.Product cannot be constructed in a\n  LINQ to Entities query"But when I use select p instead of select new Product { Name = p.Name}; it works correctly.How can I preform a custom select section?You cannot (and should not be able to) project onto a mapped entity. You can, however, project onto an annonymous type or onto a DTO:And your method will return a List of DTO\'s.You can project into anonymous type, and then from it to model typeEdit: I am going to be a bit more specific since this question got a lot of attention.You cannot project into model type directly (EF restriction), so there is no way around this. The only way is to project into anonymous type (1st iteration), and then to model type (2nd iteration).Please also be aware that when you partially load entities in this manner, they cannot be updated, so they should remain detached, as they are.I never did completely understand why this is not possible, and the answers on this thread do not give strong reasons against it (mostly speaking about partially loaded data). It is correct that in partially loaded state entity cannot be updated, but then, this entity would be detached, so accidental attempts to save them would not be possible.Consider method I used above: we still have a partially loaded model entity as a result. This entity is detached.Consider this (wish-to-exist) possible code:This could also result in a list of detached entities, so we would not need to make two iterations. A compiler would be smart to see that AsNoTracking() has been used, which will result in detached entities, so it could allow us to do this. If, however, AsNoTracking() was omitted, it could throw the same exception as it is throwing now, to warn us that we need to be specific enough about the result we want.There is another way that I found works, you have to build a class that derives from your Product class and use that. For instance:Not sure if this is "allowed", but it works.Here is one way to do this without declaring aditional class:However, this is only to be used if you want to combine multiple entities in a single entity. The above functionality (simple product to product mapping) is done like this:Another simple way :)You can use this and it should be working --> You must use toList before making the new list using select:only add AsEnumerable() :In response to the other question which was marked as duplicate (see here) I figured out a quick and easy solution based on the answer of Soren:Note: \nThis solution only works if you have a navigation property (foreign key) on the Task class (here called \'Incident\').\nIf you don\'t have that, you can just use one of the other posted solutions with  "AsQueryable()".If you are using Entity framework, then try removing property from DbContext which uses your complex model as Entity\nI had same problem when mapping multiple model into a viewmodel named Entity Removing the entry from DbContext fixed my error.if you are Executing Linq to Entity you can\'t use the ClassType with new in the select closure of query only anonymous types are allowed (new without type)take look at this snippet of my project of you added the new keyword in Select closure even on the complex properties you will got this error so remove the ClassTypes from new keyword on Linq to Entity queries ,,because it will transformed to sql statement and executed on SqlServer so when can I use new with types on select closure?you can use it if you you are dealing with  LINQ to Object (in memory collection)after I executed ToList on query it became in memory collection  so we can use new ClassTypes in selectYou can solve this by using Data Transfer Objects (DTO\'s).These are a bit like viewmodels where you put in the properties you need and you can map them manually in your controller or by using third-party solutions like AutoMapper.With DTO\'s you can :I\'ve been learning this in school this year and it\'s a very useful tool.you can add AsEnumerable to your collection like the follow :
