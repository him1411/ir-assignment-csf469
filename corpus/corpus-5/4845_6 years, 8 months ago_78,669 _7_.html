How can I find the number of cores available to my application from within Java code?If cores is less than one, either your processor is about to die, or your JVM has a serious bug in it, or the universe is about to blow up.If you want to get number of physical cores you can run cmd and terminal command and then to parse the output to get info you need. Below is shown function that returns number of physical cores.OSValidator class:}This works on Windows with Cygwin installed:System.getenv("NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS")
