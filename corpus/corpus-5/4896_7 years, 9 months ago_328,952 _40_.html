How do you put in a new line into a JavaScript alert box? \\n will put a new line in - \\n being a control code for new line.Output:some text\n  more text in a new lineyou have to use double quotes to display special char like \\n \\t etc... in js alert box\nfor exemple in php script:But a second possible problem arrives when you want to display a string specified in double quoted. see link textIf the string is enclosed in double-quotes ("), PHP will interpret more escape sequences for special charactersescape sequences \\n is transformed as 0x0A ASCII Escaped character and this character is not displayed in the alert box. The solution consists in to escape this special sequence:if you don\'t know how the string is enclosed you have to transform special characters to their escape sequencesIn C# I did:It display as:Text  Some more textList of Special Character codes in JavaScript:Just to inform, the \\n only works with double quotes.When you want to write in javascript alert from a php variable, you have to add an other "\\" before "\\n".\nInstead the alert pop-up is not working.ex: Works with \\n but if the script is into a java tag you must write \\\\\\norJust add a newline \\n character.Just in case this helps anyone, when doing this from C# code behind I had to use a double escape character or I got an "unterminated string constant" JavaScript error:Thanks for the hints.  Using the "+" sign is the only way I could get it to work.  This is the last line of a function that adds some numbers.  I\'m just learning JavaScript myself:\\n won\'t work if you\'re inside java code though:I know its not an answer, just thought it was important.use the new line character of a javascript instead of \'\\n\'.. \neg: "Hello\\nWorld" use "Hello\\x0AWorld" \nIt works great!!I saw some people had trouble with this in MVC, so... a simple way to pass \'\\n\' using the Model, and in my case even using a translated text, is to use HTML.Raw to insert the text. That fixed it for me. In the code below, Model.Alert can contains newlines, like "Hello\\nWorld"...I used: "\\n\\r" - it only works in double quotes though.A new line character in javascript can be achieved by using \\nThis can be done using Output :first linesecond linethird linehere is a jsfiddle prepared for the same.
