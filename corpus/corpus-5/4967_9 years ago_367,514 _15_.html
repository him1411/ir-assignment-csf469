What is the best way of creating an alphabetically sorted list in Python?Basic answer:This modifies your original list (i.e. sorts in-place). To get a sorted copy of the list, without changing the original, use the sorted() function:However, the examples above are a bit naive, because they don\'t take locale into account, and perform a case-sensitive sorting. You can take advantage of the optional parameter key to specify custom sorting order (the alternative, using cmp, is a deprecated solution, as it has to be evaluated multiple times - key is only computed once per element).So, to sort according to the current locale, taking language-specific rules into account (cmp_to_key is a helper function from functools):And finally, if you need, you can specify a custom locale for sorting:Last note: you will see examples of case-insensitive sorting which use the lower() method - those are incorrect, because they work only for the ASCII subset of characters. Those two are wrong for any non-English data:It is also worth noting the sorted() function:This returns a new, sorted version of a list without changing the original list.It really is that simple :)The proper way to sort strings is:The previous example of mylist.sort(key=lambda x: x.lower()) will work fine for ASCII-only contexts.But how does this handle language specific sorting rules? Does it take locale into account?No, list.sort() is a generic sorting function. If you want to sort according to the Unicode rules, you\'ll have to define a custom sort key function. You can try using the pyuca module, but I don\'t know how complete it is.Suppose s = "ZWzaAd", To sort this string the simple solution will be below one.\nprint \'\'.join(sorted(s)
