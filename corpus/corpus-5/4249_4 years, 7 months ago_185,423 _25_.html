I was playing around with Java 8 lambdas to easily filter collections. But I did not find a concise way to retrieve the result as a new list within the same statement. Here is my most concise approach so far:Examples on the net did not answer my question because they stop without generating a new result list. There must be a more concise way. I would have expected, that the Stream class has methods as toList(), toSet(), \xe2\x80\xa6Is there a way that the variables targetLongList can be directly be assigned by the third line?What you are doing may be the simplest way, provided your stream stays sequential—otherwise you will have to put a call to sequential() before forEach. [later edit: the reason the call to sequential() is necessary is that the code as it stands (forEach(targetLongList::add)) would be racy if the stream was parallel. Even then, it will not achieve the effect intended, as forEach is explicitly nondeterministic—even in a sequential stream the order of element processing is not guaranteed. You would have to use forEachOrdered to ensure correct ordering. The intention of the Stream API designers is that you will use collector in this situation, as below.]An alternative is Another approach can be to use Collectors.toCollection:I like to use a util method that returns a collector for ArrayList when that is what I want. I think the solution using Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new) is a little too noisy for such a common operation.Example:With this answer I also want to demonstrate how simple it is to create and use custom collectors, which is very useful generally.If you have an array of primitives, you can use the primitive collections available in Eclipse Collections.If you can\'t change the sourceLongList from List:If you want to use LongStream:Note: I am a contributor to Eclipse Collections.A little more efficient way (avoid the creating the source List and the auto-unboxing by the filter):If you don\'t mind using 3rd party libraries, AOL\'s cyclops-react lib (disclosure I am a contributor) has extensions for all JDK Collection types, including List. The ListX interface extends java.util.List and adds a large number of useful operators, including filter.You can simply write-ListX also can be created from an existing List (via ListX.fromIterable)In case someone (like me) out there is looking for ways deal with Objects instead of primitive types then use mapToObj()prints:Here is code by AbacusUtilDisclosure\xef\xbc\x9a I\'m the developer of AbacusUtil.This is the call which you can use to convert any Stream to List.If you don\'t use parallel() this will work
