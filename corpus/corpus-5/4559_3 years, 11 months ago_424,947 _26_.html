I want to change the minimum SDK version in Android Studio from API 12 to API 14. I have tried changing it in the manifest file, i.e.,and rebuilding the project, but I still get the Android Studio IDE throwing up some errors. I presume I have to set the min SDK in \'project properties\' or something similar so the IDE recognizes the change, but I can\'t find where this is done in Android Studio.When you want to update your minSdkVersion in an existent project...An example of build.gradle:After updating the build.gradle\'s minSdkVersion, you have to click on the button to sync gradle file ("Sync Project with Gradle files"). That will clear the marker.Updating manifest.xml, for e.g. deleting any references to SDK levels in the manifest file, is NOT necessary anymore in Android Studio.For android studio users:The gradle will rebuild the project automatically. As now Android Studio is stable, there is an easy way to do it.PS: Though this question was already answered but Android Studio has changed a little bit by its stable release. So an easy straight forward way will help any new answer seeker landing here.In android studio you can easily press: You can also change the versionCode of your app there.In build.gradle change minSdkVersion 13 to minSdkVersion 8 Thats all you need to do. I solved my problem by only doing this.According to this answer, you just  don\'t include minsdkversion in the manifest.xml, and the build system will use the values from the build.gradle file and put the information into the final apk.Because the build system needs this information anyway, this makes sense. You should not need to define this values two times.You just have to sync the project after changing the build.gradle file, but Android Studio 0.5.2 display a yellow status bar on top of the build.gradle editor window to help youAlso note there at least two build.gradle files: one master and one for the app/module. The one to change is in the app/module, it already includes a property minSdkVersion in a newly generated project.If you\'re having troubles specifying the SDK target to Google APIs instead of the base Platform SDK just change the compileSdkVersion 19 to compileSdkVersion "Google Inc.:Google APIs:19"As well as updating the manifest, update the module\'s build.gradle file too (it\'s listed in the project pane just below the manifest - if there\'s no minSdkVersion key in it, you\'re looking at the wrong one, as there\'s a couple). A rebuild and things should be fine...For me what worked was: (right click)project->android tools->clear lint markers. Although for some reason the Manifest reverted to the old (lower) minimum API level, but after I changed it back to the new (higher) API level there was no red error underline and the project now uses the new minimum API level.Edit: Sorry, I see you were using Android Studio, not Eclipse. But I guess there is a similar \'clear lint markers\' in Studio somewhere and it might solve the problem.In Android studio open build.gradle and edit the following section:here you can change minSdkVersion from 12 to 14Changing the minSdkVersion in the manifest is not necessary. If you change it in the gradle build file, as seen below, you accomplish what you need to do. Gradle Scripts ->\nbuild.gradle (Module: app) ->\nminSdkVersion (Your min sdk version)
