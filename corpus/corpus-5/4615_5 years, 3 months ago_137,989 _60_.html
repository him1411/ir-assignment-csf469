I have some fonts being configured in my Scss file like so:The actual font file are stored in /app/assets/fonts/I have added config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join("app", "assets", "fonts") to my application.rb fileand the compile CSS source is as follows:But when I run the app the font files are not being found. The logs:Started GET "/assets/icoMoon.ttf" for 127.0.0.1 at 2012-06-05 23:21:17 +0100\n  Served asset /icoMoon.ttf - 404 Not Found (13ms)Why isn\'t the asset pipeline flattening the font files down into just /assets?Any ideas people?Kind regards,\nNeilExtra info:When checking the rails console for assets paths and assetprecompile I get the following:If you are on Rails >3.1.0 and <4, you can simply place your fonts in the folders app/assets/fonts, lib/assets/fonts or vendor/assets/fonts.If you are on Rails 4+, you can only place your fonts in the folder app/assets/fonts.If you want to place them outside of these designated folders, you\'ll need to add the following configuration:config.assets.precompile << /\\.(?:svg|eot|woff|ttf)\\z/If you are on Rails 4.2+, it\'s recommended to add this configuration in the file config/initializers/assets.rb.If you are not, add it to the file application.rb or production.rb.Declare your font in your css like so:Make sure that the font is named exactly like in the url portion of the declaration. Capital letters and punctuation marks make a difference. So in this case the font should have the name icomoon.If you are using Sass or Less with Rails 3.1.0+ (so your css file has the .scss or .less extension), then change the url(...) in the font declaration to font-url(...).If you are not, then your css file should have the extension .css.erb and the font declaration should be changed to url(\'<%= asset_path(...) %>\').Additionally, if you are using Rails 3.2.1+, you can use font_path(...) instead of asset_path(...). This helper does exactly the same thing but it\'s just a little more clear.Finally, use your font in your css like you declared it in the font-family part. Since it was declared capitalized, you can use it like this:Now here\'s a twist:You should place all fonts in app/assets/fonts/ as they WILL get precompiled in staging and production by default\xe2\x80\x94they will get precompiled when pushed to heroku.Font files placed in vendor/assets will NOT be precompiled on staging or production by default \xe2\x80\x94 they will fail on heroku. Source!\xe2\x80\x94 @plapier, thoughtbot/bourbonI strongly believe that putting vendor fonts into vendor/assets/fonts\n  makes a lot more sense than putting them into app/assets/fonts. With\n  these 2 lines of extra configuration this has worked well for me (on\n  Rails 4):\xe2\x80\x94 @jhilden, thoughtbot/bourbonI\'ve also tested it on rails 4.0.0. Actually the last one line is enough to safely precompile fonts from vendor folder. Took a couple of hours to figure it out. Hope it helped someone.If you don\'t want to keep track of moving your fonts around:You need to use font-url in your @font-face block, not urlas well as this line in application.rb, as you mentioned (for fonts in app/assets/fontsHere my approach to using fonts in asset pipeline:1) Put all your font file under app/assets/fonts/, actually you are not restricted to put it under fonts folder name. You can put any subfolder name you like. E.g. app/assets/abc or app/assets/anotherfonts. But i highly recommend you put it under app/assets/fonts/ for better folder structure.2) From your sass file, using the sass helper font-path to request your font assets like this  3) Run bundle exec rake assets:precompile from your local machine and see your application.css result. You should see something like this:If you want to know more how asset pipeline work, you can visit the following simple guide:\nhttps://designcode.commandrun.com/rails-asset-pipeline-simple-guide-830e2e666f6c#.6lejlayk2I\'m using Rails 4.2, and could not get the footable icons to show up.  Little boxes were showing, instead of the (+) on collapsed rows and the little sorting arrows I expected.  After studying the information here, I made one simple change to my code:  remove the font directory in css.  That is, change all the css entries like this: to look like this:It worked.  I think Rails 4.2 already assumes the font directory, so specifying it again in the css code makes the font files not get found.  Hope this helps.  I was having this problem on Rails 4.2 (with ruby 2.2.3) and had to edit the font-awesome _paths.scss partial to remove references to $fa-font-path and removing a leading forward slash. The following was broken:And the following works:An alternative would be to simply remove the forward slash following the interpolated $fa-font-path and then define $fa-font-path as an empty string or subdirectory with trailing forward slash (as needed).Remember to recompile assets and restart your server as needed. For example, on a passenger setup:Then reload your browser.I had a similar issue when I upgraded my Rails 3 app to Rails 4 recently. My fonts were not working properly as in the Rails 4+, we are only allowed to keep the fonts under app/assets/fonts directory. But my Rails 3 app had a different font organization. So I had to configure the app so that it still works with Rails 4+ having my fonts in a different place other than app/assets/fonts. I have tried several solutions but after I found non-stupid-digest-assets gem, it just made it so easy.Add this gem by adding the following line to your Gemfile:Then run:And finally add the following line in your config/initializers/non_digest_assets.rb file:That\'s it. This solved my problem nicely. Hope this helps someone who have encountered similar problem like me.If you have a file called scaffolds.css.scss, then there\'s a chance that\'s overriding all the custom things you\'re doing in the other files. I commented out that file and suddenly everything worked. If there isn\'t anything important in that file, you might as well just delete it!In my case the original question was using asset-url without results instead of plain url css property. Using asset-url ended up working for me in Heroku. Plus setting the fonts in /assets/fonts folder and calling asset-url(\'font.eot\') without adding any subfolder or any other configuration to it.just place your fonts inside app/assets/fonts folder and set the autoload path when app start using writing the code in application.rb config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join("app", "assets", "fonts")\nand then  use the following code in css.@font-face {}Give it a try.Thanks
