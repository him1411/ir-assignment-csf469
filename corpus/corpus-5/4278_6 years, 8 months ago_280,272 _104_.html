I\'ve written a jQuery plug-in that\'s for use on both desktop and mobile devices. I wondered if there is a way with JavaScript to detect if the device has touch screen capability. I\'m using jquery-mobile.js to detect the touch screen events and it works on iOS, Android etc., but I\'d also like to write conditional statements based on whether the user\'s device has a touch screen.Is that possible?Update: Please read blmstr\'s answer below before pulling a whole feature detection library into your project. Detecting actual touch support is more complex, and Modernizr only covers a basic use case.Modernizr is a great, lightweight way to do all kinds of feature detection on any site.It simply adds classes to the html element for each feature.You can then target those features easily in CSS and JS. For example:And Javascript (jQuery example):Have you tried using this function? (This is the same as Modernizr used to use.)UPDATE:document.createEvent("TouchEvent") have started to return true in the latest chrome (v. 17). Modernizr updated this a while ago. Check Modernizr test out here.Update your function like this to make it work:UPDATE:I found that the above wasn\'t working on IE10 (returning false on MS Surface). Here is the fix:UPDATE:\'onmsgesturechange\' in window will return true in some IE desktop versions so thats not reliable. This works slightly more reliably:Or Modernizr have updated their tests to include some CSS media-query magic, so you could try that.But these are all still far from perfect. For a good article that explains the issues with touch detection, see: \nStu Cox: You Can\'t Detect a Touchscreen.As Modernizr doesn\'t detect IE10 on Windows Phone 8/WinRT, a simple, cross-browser solution is:You only ever need to check once as the device won\'t suddenly support or not support touch, so just store it in a variable so you can use it multiple times more efficiently.Using all the comments above I\'ve assembled the following code that is working for my needs:I have tested this on iPad, Android (Browser and Chrome), Blackberry Playbook, iPhone 4s, Windows Phone 8, IE 10, IE 8, IE 10 (Windows 8 with Touchscreen), Opera, Chrome and Firefox.It currently fails on Windows Phone 7 and I haven\'t been able to find a solution for that browser yet.Hope someone finds this useful.I like this one:If you use Modernizr, it is very easy to use Modernizr.touch as mentioned earlier.However, I prefer using a combination of Modernizr.touch and user agent testing, just to be safe.If you don\'t use Modernizr, you can simply replace the Modernizr.touch function above with (\'ontouchstart\' in document.documentElement)Also note that testing the user agent iemobile will give you broader range of detected Microsoft mobile devices than Windows Phone.Also see this SO questionWe tried the modernizr implementation, but detecting the touch events is not consistent anymore (IE 10 has touch events on windows desktop, IE 11 works, because the\'ve dropped touch events and added pointer api). So we decided to optimize the website as a touch site as long as we don\'t know what input type the user has. This is more reliable than any other solution.Our researches say, that most desktop users move with their mouse over the screen before they click, so we can detect them and change the behaviour before they are able to click or hover anything.This is a simplified version of our code:Working FiddleI have achieved it like this;This one works well even in Windows Surface tablets !!!  There is something better than checking if they have a touchScreen, is to check if they are using it, plus that\'s easier to check.I used pieces of the code above to detect whether touch, so my fancybox iframes would show up on desktop computers and not on touch. I noticed that Opera Mini for Android 4.0 was still registering as a non-touch device when using blmstr\'s code alone. (Does anyone know why?) I ended up using:Check out this post, it gives a really nice code snippet for what to do when touch devices are detected or what to do if touchstart event is called:I would avoid using screen width to determine if a device is a touch device. There are touch screens much larger than 699px, think of Windows 8. Navigatior.userAgent may be nice to override false postives. I would recommend checking out this issue on Modernizr.Are you wanting to test if the device supports touch events or is a touch device. Unfortunately, that\'s not the same thing.No, it\'s not possible. The excellent answers given are only ever partial, because any given method will produce false positives and false negatives. Even the browser doesn\'t always know if a touchscreen is present, due to OS APIs, and the fact can change during a browser session, particularly with KVM-type arrangements.See further details in this excellent article:http://www.stucox.com/blog/you-cant-detect-a-touchscreen/The article suggests you reconsider the assumptions that make you want to detect touchscreens, they\'re probably wrong. (I checked my own for my app, and my assumptions were indeed wrong!)The article concludes:For layouts, assume everyone has a touchscreen. Mouse users can use\n  large UI controls much more easily than touch users can use small\n  ones. The same goes for hover states.For events and interactions, assume anyone may have a touchscreen.\n  Implement keyboard, mouse and touch interactions alongside each other,\n  ensuring none block each other.The biggest "gotcha" with trying to detect touch is on hybrid devices that support both touch and the trackpad/mouse. Even if you\'re able to correctly detect whether the user\'s device supports touch, what you really need to do is detect what input device the user is currently using. There\'s a detailed write up of this challenge and a possible solution here. Basically the approach to figuring out whether a user just touched the screen or used a mouse/ trackpad instead is to register both a touchstart and mouseover event on the page:A touch action will trigger both of these events, though the former (touchstart) always first on most devices. So counting on this predictable sequence of events, you can create a mechanism that dynamically adds or removes a can-touch class to the document root to reflect the current input type of the user at this moment on the document:More details here.It looks like Chrome 24 now support touch events, probably for Windows 8. So the code posted here no longer works. Instead of trying to detect if touch is supported by the browser, I\'m now binding both touch and click events and making sure only one is called: And then calling it: Hope this helps !I use:in jQuery mobile 1.0.1All browser supported except Firefox for desktop always TRUE because of Firefox for desktop support responsive design for developer even you click Touch-Button or not!I hope Mozilla will fix this in next version.I\'m using Firefox 28 desktop.I also struggled a lot with different options on how to detect in Javascript whether the page is displayed on a touch screen device or not.\nIMO, as of now, no real option exists to detect the option properly.\nBrowsers either report touch events on desktop machines (because the OS maybe touch-ready), or some solutions don\'t work on all mobile devices.In the end, I realized that I was following the wrong approach from the start:\nIf my page was to look similar on touch and non-touch devices, I maybe shouldn\'t have to worry about detecting the property at all:\nMy scenario was to deactivate tooltips over buttons on touch devices as they lead to double-taps where I wanted a single tap to activate the button.My solution was to refactor the view so that no tooltip was needed over a button, and in the end I didn\'t need to detect the touch device from Javascript with methods that all have their drawbacks.You can install modernizer and use a simple touch event. This is very effective and works on every device I have tested it on including windows surface!I\'ve created a jsFiddle The practical answer seems to be one that considers the context:1) Public site (no login)\n  Code the UI to work with both options together.2) Login site\nCapture whether a mouse-move occurred on the login form, and save this into a hidden input. The value is passed with the login credentials and added to the user\'s session, so it can be used for the duration of the session.Jquery to add to login page only:(+1 to @Dave Burt and +1 to @Martin Lantzsch on their answers)jQuery v1.11.3There is a lot of good information in the answers provided.  But, recently I spent a lot of time trying to actually tie everything together into a working solution for the accomplishing two things:Besides this post and Detecting touch screen devices with Javascript, I found this post by Patrick Lauke extremely helpful: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/04/detecting-touch-its-the-why-not-the-how/Here is the code...Important!  The *.on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler ) method needs to have a selector, usually an element, that can handle the "touchstart" event, or any other like event associated with touches.  In this case, it is the hyperlink element "a".Now, you don\'t need to handle the regular mouse clicking in JavaScript, because you can use CSS to handle these events using selectors for the hyperlink "a" element like so:Note:  There are other selectors as well...Due to hybrid devices which use a combination of touch and mouse input, you need to be able dynamically change the state / variable which controls whether a piece of code should run if the user is a touch user or not.Touch devices also fire mousemove on tap.Tested on Safari iOS and Chrome for Android.Note: not 100% sure on the pointer-events for MS Surface, etc.Codepen demoor would be a more thorough check I suppose.Extent jQuery support object:And now you can check it anywhere, like this:Many of these work but either require jQuery, or javascript linters complain about the syntax. Considering your initial question asks for a "JavaScript" (not jQuery, not Modernizr) way of solving this, here\'s a simple function that works every time. It\'s also about as minimal as you can get.One last benefit I\'ll mention is that this code is framework and device agnostic. Enjoy!This seems to be working fine for me so far:Quick note to those who may be tempted to write window.ontouchstart !== undefined --> please use micnic answer, as undefined is not a keyword in JavaScript.  Big Problem if develop writes something like:Developer can make undefined anything they want, and you may as well check if window.ontouchstart = myNonExistingWord;No disrespect to those who gave this answer: pretty sure I wrote that in my code too ;)When a mouse is attached, it can be assumed with fairly high hitrate (I would say practially 100%) that the user moves the mouse at least a tiny distance after page is ready - without any clicking. The mechanism below detects this. If detected, I consider this as a sign of missing touch support or, if supported, of minor importance when a mouse is in use. Touch-device is assumed if not detected.EDIT This approach may not fit all purposes. It can be used to control functionality that is activated based on user interaction on the loaded page, for instance an image viewer. The code below will also leave the mousemove event bound on devices without mouse as it stands out now. Other approaches may be better.Roughly, it goes like this (sorry for jQuery, but similar in pure Javascript):You can use the following code:Source: Detecting touch-based browsing and @mplungjan post.The above solution was based on detecting event support without browser sniffing article.You can check the results at the following test page.Please note that the above code tests only whether the browser has support for touch, not the device. So if you\'ve laptop with touch-screen, your browser may not have the support for the touch events. The recent Chrome supports touch events, but other browser may not.You could also try:but it may not work on iPhone devices.
