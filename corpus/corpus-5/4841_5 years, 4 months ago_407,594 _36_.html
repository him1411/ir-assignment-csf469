I\'m trying to initialize a data.frame without any rows. Basically, I want to specify the data types for each column and name them, but not have any rows created as a result.The best I\'ve been able to do so far is something like:Which creates a data.frame with a single row containing all of the data types and column names I wanted, but also creates a useless row which then needs to be removed.Is there a better way to do this?Just initialize it with empty vectors:Here\'s an other example with different column types :N.B. :Initializing a data.frame with an empty column of the wrong type does not prevent further additions of rows having columns of different types.\nThis method is just a bit safer in the sense that you\'ll have the correct column types from the beginning, hence if your code relies on some column type checking, it will work even with a data.frame with zero rows.You can do it without specifying column typesYou could use read.table with an empty string for the input text as follows:Alternatively specifying the col.names as a string:Thanks to Richard Scriven for the improvementIf you already have an existent data frame, let\'s say df that has the columns you want, then you can just create an empty data frame by removing all the rows:Notice that df still contains the data, but empty_df doesn\'t.I found this question looking for how to create a new instance with empty rows, so I think it might be helpful for some people.The most efficient way to do this is to use structure to create a list that has the class "data.frame":To put this into perspective compared to the presently accepted answer, here\'s a simple benchmark:If you are looking for shortness :so you don\'t need to specify the column names separately. You get the default column type logical until you fill the data frame.I created empty data frame using following code and tried to bind some rows to populate the same as follows.but it started giving incorrect column names as followsSolution to this is to convert newrow to type df as follows now gives correct data frame when displayed with column names as followsjust declare table = data.frame()\nwhen you try to rbind the first line it will create the columnsIf you want to declare such a data.frame with many columns, it\'ll probably be a pain to type all the column classes out by hand. Especially if you can make use of rep, this approach is easy and fast (about 15% faster than the other solution that can be generalized like this):If your desired column classes are in a vector colClasses, you can do the following:lapply will result in a list of desired length, each element of which is simply an empty typed vector like numeric() or integer().setDF converts this list by reference to a data.frame.setnames adds the desired names by reference.Speed comparison:It\'s also faster than using structure in a similar way:Just pass in the number of rows and columns needed: If you want to create an empty data.frame with dynamic names (colnames in a variable), this can help:You can change the type as well if you need so.Say your column names are dynamic, you can create an empty row-named matrix and transform it to a data frame.
