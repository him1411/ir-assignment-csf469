I have a very long file which I want to print but skipping the first 1e6 lines for example. I look into the cat man page but I did not see any option to do this. I am looking for a command to do this or a simple bash program.You\'ll need tail.  If you really need to SKIP a particular number of lines, useThat is, if you want to skip N lines, you start printing line N+1. Example:If you want to just see the last so many lines, omit the "+":If you have GNU tail available on your system, you can do the following:It\'s the + character that does what you want.  To quote from the man page:If  the  first  character of K (the number of bytes or lines) is a\n  `+\', print beginning with the Kth item from the start of each  file.Thus, as noted in the comment, putting +1000001 starts printing with the first item after the first 1,000,000 lines.Easiest way I found to remove the first ten lines of a file:A less verbose version with AWK:But I would recommend using integer numbers.Just to propose a sed alternative. :) To skip first one million lines, try |sed \'1,1000000d\'.Example:This shell script works fine for me:Used with this sample file (file.txt):The command (it will extract from second to fourth line in the file):Output of this command:Of course, you can improve it, for example by testing that all argument values are the expected :-)if you want to skip first two line\ntail -n +3 <filename>if you want to skip first x line \ntail -n +$((x+1)) <filename> If you want to see first 10 line you can use sed as below:or if you want to see lines from 20 to 30 you can use:You can do this using the head and tail commands:where num is 1e6 + the number of lines you want to print.Use the sed delete command with a range address.  For example:Alternatively, if you want to only print a known range use the print command with the -n flag:This solution should work reliably on all UNIX systems, regardless of the presence of GNU utilities.I needed to do the same and found this thread.I tried "tail -n +, but it just printed everything.The more +lines worked nicely on the prompt, but it turned out it behaved totally different when run in headless mode (cronjob).I finally wrote this myself:
