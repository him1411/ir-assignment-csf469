I have a private key protected with a password to access a server via SSH. I have 2 linux (ubuntu 10.04) machines and the behavior of ssh-add command is different in both of them. In one machine, once I use "ssh-add .ssh/identity" and entered my password, the key was added permanently, i.e., every time I shutdown the computer and login again, the key is already added.In the other one, I have to add the key every time I login. As far as I remember, I did the same thing on both. The only difference is that the key was created on the one that is added permanently.Does anyone know how to add it permanently to the other machine as well?A solution would be to force the key files to be kept permanently, by adding them in your ~/.ssh/config file:If you want all users on the computer to use the key put these lines into /etc/ssh/ssh_config and the key in a folder accessible to all.Additionally if you want to set the key specific to one host, you can do the following in your ~/.ssh/config :You\'ll need to clone with @github instead of @github.com, but this has the advantage that only this key will be tried. This didn\'t answer the same issue for me under Mac OS X Lion.  I ended up adding:To my .zshrc (but .profile would be fine too), which seems to have fixed it.  (As suggested here: http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/09/permanently-add-ssh-key-ssh-add/ )I solved that problem on Mac OSX (10.10) by using -K option for ssh-add:Just add the keychain, as referenced in Ubuntu Quick Tips\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/QuickTipsWhatInstead of constantly starting up ssh-agent and ssh-add, it is possible to use keychain to manage your ssh keys. To install keychain, you can just click here, or use Synaptic to do the job or apt-get from the command line.Command lineAnother way to install the file is to open the terminal (Application->Accessories->Terminal) and type:Edit FileYou then should add the following lines to your ${HOME}/.bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc:I tried @Aaron\'s solution and it didn\'t quite work for me, because it would re-add my keys every time I opened a new tab in my terminal. So I modified it a bit(note that most of my keys are also password-protected so I can\'t just send the output to /dev/null): What this does is that it checks the output of ssh-add -l(which lists all keys that have been added) for a specific key and if it doesn\'t find it, then it adds it with ssh-add. Now the first time I open my terminal I\'m asked for the passwords for my private keys and I\'m not asked again until I reboot(or logout - I haven\'t checked) my computer.Since I have a bunch of keys I store the output of ssh-add -l in a variable to improve performance(at least I guess it improves performance :) )PS: I\'m on linux and this code went to my ~/.bashrc file - if you are on Mac OS X, then I assume you should add it to .zshrc or .profileEDIT:\nAs pointed out by @Aaron in the comments, the .zshrc file is used from the zsh shell - so if you\'re not using that(if you\'re not sure, then most likely, you\'re using bash instead), this code should go to your .bashrc file.In my case the solution was:Permissions on the config file should be 600. chmod 600 configAs mentioned in the comments above by\n generalopinionNo need to touch the config file contents.On Ubuntu 14.04 (maybe earlier, maybe still) you don\'t even need the console:very simple  ^_^  two steps1.yum install keychain2.add code below to .bash_profileAdding the following lines in "~/.bashrc" solved the issue for me. I\'m using Ubuntu 14.04 desktop.I run Ubuntu using two id_rsa key\'s. (one personal one for work). \nssh-add would remember one key (personal one) and forget the company one every time.Checking out the difference between the two I saw my personal key had 400 rights while the company one had 600 rights. (had u+w). \nRemoving the user write right from the company key (u-w or set to 400) fixed my problem. ssh-add now remembers both keys.This worked for me.
