I want to discard all changes done after commit <commit-hash> .\nSo I did:Now I want to do the same with my remote. How can I do this? I have done some commits (and pushes) after <commit-hash> and I just want to discard them all. Is just something went terribly wrong in the way and I don\'t want to make it worse than it is already. ;(I basically want to rewind my origin/master to <commit-hash>Assuming that your branch is called master both here and remotely, and that your remote is called origin you could do:However, you should avoid doing this if anyone else is working with your remote repository and has pulled your changes.  In that case, it would be better to revert the commits that you don\'t want, then pushing as normal.Update: you\'ve explained below that other people have pulled the changes that you\'ve pushed, so it\'s better to create a new commit that reverts all of those changes.  There\'s a nice explanation of your options for doing this in this answer from Jakub Nar\xc4\x99bski.  Which one is most convenient depends on how many commits you want to revert, and which method makes most sense to you.Since from your question it\'s clear that you have already used git reset --hard to reset your master branch, you may need to start by using git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD to move your branch back to where it was before.  (As always with git reset --hard, make sure that git status is clean, that you\'re on the right branch and that you\'re aware of git reflog as a tool to recover apparently lost commits.)  You should also check that ORIG_HEAD points to the right commit, with git show ORIG_HEAD.I solved problem like yours by this commands:Use the other answers if you don\'t mind losing local changes. This method can still wreck your remote if you choose the wrong commit hash to go back to.If you just want to make the remote match a commit that\'s already in your local branch:Run a command like:e.g.My two cents to the previous answers: if still doesn\'t work, you might want to edit <your-remote-repo>.git/config file\'s receive section:Do one thing,\nget the commit\'s  SHA no. such as 87c9808 and then,error: failed to push some refs to \n  \'https://github.com/YOURREPOSITORY/AndroidExperiments.git\'\n  hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind\n  hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.\n  hint: \'git pull ...\') before pushing again.**git push --force origin masterIf you want a previous version of file, I would recommend using git checkout.Doing this will send you back in time, it does not affect the current state of your project, you can come to mainline\n    git checkout mainlinebut when you add a file in the argument, that file is brought back to you\nfrom a previous time to your current project time, i.e. your current project is changed and needs to be committed.The advantage of this is that it does not delete history, and neither does revert a particular code changes (git revert)Check more here https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes#git-checkout
