I know that in a php script:will follow redirects. Is there a way to follow redirects with command line cURL?Use the location header flag:curl -L <URL>I had a similar problem. I am posting my solution here because I believe it might help one of the commenters.For me, the obstacle was that the page required a login and then gave me a new URL through javascript. Here is what I had to do:curl -c cookiejar -g -O -J -L -F "j_username=yourusename" -F "j_password=yourpassword"  <URL>Note that j_username and j_password is the name of the fields for my website\'s login form. You will have to open the source of the webpage to see what the \'name\' of the username field and the \'name\' of the password field is in your case.\nAfter that I go an html file with java script in which the new URL was embedded. After parsing this out just resubmit with the new URL:curl -c cookiejar -g -O -J -L -F "j_username=yourusename" -F "j_password=yourpassword"  <NEWURL>
