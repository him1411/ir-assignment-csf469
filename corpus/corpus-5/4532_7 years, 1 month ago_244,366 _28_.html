I have an onActivityResult returning from an mediastore image selection which I can get a URI for an image using the following:Converting this to a string gives this:Or to a path gives:However I can\'t seem to find a way to convert this into an absolute path, as I want to load the image into a bitmap without having to copy it somewhere. I know this can be done using the URI and content resolver, but this seems to break on rebooting of the phone, I guess MediaStore doesn\'t keep its numbering the same between reboots.Just a simple update on the first answer: mActivity.managedQuery() is now deprecated. I\'ve updated the code with the new method.android dev sourceDon\'t try to find a uri in the filesystem, that\'s slow to go look things up in the database.You can get a bitmap from a uri by giving an input stream to the factory like you give a file to the factory:For All version I have made this method which get real path from uriHere it is my example of getting file name, from URI like file://... and content://... . It\'s works for me not only with Android MediaStore but also with third part application like EzExplorer.Good existing answers, some of which I used to come up with my own:I have to get the path from URIs and get the URI from paths, and Google has a hard time telling the difference so for anyone who has the same issue (e.g., to get the thumbnail from the MediaStore of a video whose physical location you already have).  The former:The latter (which I do for videos, but can also be used for Audio or Files or other types of stored content by substituting MediaStore.Audio (etc) for MediaStore.Video):Basically, the DATA column of MediaStore (or whichever sub-section of it you\'re querying) stores the file path, so you either use what you know to look up that DATA field, or use the field to look up whatever else you want.I then further use the Scheme as above to figure out what to do with my data:None of these answers worked for me in all cases. I had to go directly to Google\'s Documentation https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.html on this topic and found this useful method:You can use this bitmap to display it in an Image View.Solution for those, who have problem after moving to KitKat: "This will get the file path from the MediaProvider, DownloadsProvider, and ExternalStorageProvider, while falling back to the unofficial ContentProvider method" https://stackoverflow.com/a/20559175/690777Since managedQuery has been deprecated, you could try:Here I am going to show you that how to create a BROWSE button, which when you will click, it will open up the SD card, you will select a File and as a result you will get the file name and file path of the selected one:After getting an image from the gallery, just pass the URI in the below method only for Android 4.4 (KitKat):This solution works for every case:It is too hard in some cases get the path from the URL. Then why do you need the path? To copy the file in other place? You don\'t need the path.Slightly modified version of @PercyPercy - it doesn\'t throw and just returns null if anything goes wrong:Here you get the name of the fileSimple and easy. You can do this from the URI just like below!Bitmap bitmap = MediaStore.Images.Media.getBitmap(getContentResolver(), uri);
