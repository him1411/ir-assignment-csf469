I want to save my Edit to Database and I am using Entity FrameWork Code-First in ASP.NET MVC 3 / C# but I am getting errors. In my Event class, I have DateTime and TimeSpan datatypes but in my database, I\'ve got Date and time respectively. Could this be the reason? How can I cast to the appropriate datatype in the code before saving changes to database.Method in the controller >>>> Problem at storeDB.SaveChanges();with SQL Server 2008 R2 Database / T-SQL  Http Form  Server Error in \'/\' Application.Validation failed for one or more entities. See \'EntityValidationErrors\' property for more details.Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. Exception Details: System.Data.Entity.Validation.DbEntityValidationException: Validation failed for one or more entities.

See \'EntityValidationErrors\' property for more details.]You can extract all the information from the DbEntityValidationException with the following code (you need to add the namespaces: System.Data.Entity.Validation and System.Diagnostics to your using list):No code change required:While you are in debug mode within the catch {...} block open up the "QuickWatch" window (Ctrl+Alt+Q) and paste in there:or:If you are not in a try/catch or don\'t have access to the exception object.This will allow you to drill down into the ValidationErrors tree. It\'s the easiest way I\'ve found to get instant insight into these errors.In the case you have classes with same property names, here is a small extension to Praveen\'s answer:As an improvement to both Praveen and Tony, I use an override:I was getting this error today and couldn\'t work it out for a while, but I realised it was after adding some RequireAttributes to my models and that some development seed data was not populating all of the required fields.\nSo just a note that if you\'re getting this error whilst updating the database through some sort of init strategy like DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges then you have to make sure that your seed data fulfils and satisfies any model data validation attributes.I know this is slightly different to the problem in the question, but it\'s a popular question so I thought I\'d add a bit more to the answer for others having the same issue as myself.\nHope this helps others :)I think adding try/catch for every SaveChanges() operation is not a good practice, it\'s better to centralize this :Add this class to the main DbContext class :This will overwrite your context\'s SaveChanges() method and you\'ll get a comma separated list containing all the entity validation errors.this also can improved, to log errors in production env, instead of just throwing an error.hope this is helpful.This code helped find my problem when I had issue with my Entity VAlidation Erros. It told me the exact problem with my Entity Definition.\nTry following code where you need to cover storeDB.SaveChanges(); in following try catch block. Here\'s an extension to Tony\'s extension... :-)For Entity Framework 4.x, if you want to get the name and value of the key field so that you know which entity instance (DB record) has the problem, you can add the following.  This provides access to the more powerful ObjectContext class members from your DbContext object.I dont like exceptions\nI registered the OnSaveChanges and have thisThis error also happens when you try to save an entity that has validation errors. A good way to cause this is to forget to check ModelState.IsValid before saving to your DB.Make sure that if you have nvarchar(50)in DB row you don\'t trying to insert more than 50characters in it. Stupid mistake but took me 3 hours to figure it out.This might be due to the maximum number of characters allowed for a specific column, like in sql one field might have following Data Type nvarchar(5) but the number of characters entered from the user is more than the specified, hence the error arises.Thnaks for your answers, it help me alot.\nas i code in Vb.Net, this Bolt code for Vb.Netit may caused by Property which is not populated by model.. instead it is populated by Controller.. which may cause this error.. solution to this is assign the property before applying ModelState validation. \nand this second Assumption is . you may have already have Data in your Database\n   and trying to update it it but now fetching it.  I have faced same issue a couple of days ago while updating the database. In my case, there was few new non nullable columns added for maintenance which was not supplied in the code which is causing the exception. I figure out those fields and supplied values for them and its resolved.This implementation wrap entity exception to exception with detail text.\nIt handles DbEntityValidationException, DbUpdateException, datetime2 range errors (MS SQL), and include key of invalid entity in message (useful when savind many entities at one SaveChanges call).First, override SaveChanges in DbContext class:ExceptionHelper class:
