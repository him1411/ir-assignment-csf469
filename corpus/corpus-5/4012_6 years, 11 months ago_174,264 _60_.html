Trying to build my project on the build server gives me the following error:I solved this problem a few months ago, with installing Visual Studio 2010 on the Build Server. But now I\'m setup a new server from scratch, and I want to know if there any better solution to solve this issue.To answer the title of the question (but not the question about the output you\'re getting):Copying the following folder from your dev machine to your build server fixes this if it\'s just web applicationsC:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v10.0\\WebApplicationsRemove x86 according to how your build breaks. If you have other project types you will probably need to copy the entire msbuild folder.Building and publishing WAPs is not supported if VS is not installed. With that said, if you really do not want to install VS then you will need to copy all the files under %ProgramFiles32%\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\. You will need to install the Web Deploy Tool as well. I think that is it.If you\'d prefer not to modify anything on build server, and you still want the project to build right out of source control, it might be a good idea to put the required binaries under source control. You\'ll need to modify the imports section in your project file to look like this:The first line is the actual import from the new location that is relative to the solution directory. The second one is a turned-off version (Condition="false") of the original line that allows for Visual Studio to still consider your project to be a valid Web Application Project (that\'s the trick that VS 2010 SP1 does itself). Don\'t forget to copy the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v10.0\\WebApplications to BuildTargets folder under your source control.Based on this post here you can simply download the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Shell (Integrated) Redistributable Package and the targets are installed.This avoids the need to install Visual Studio on the build server.I have just tried this out now, and can verify that it works:Before:error MSB4019: The imported project "C:\\Program Files\n  (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v10.0\\WebApplications\\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets"\n  was not found. Confirm that the path in the  declaration is\n  correct, and that the file exists on disk.After the install:[Builds correctly]This is a far better solution than installing Visual Studio on a build server, obviously. You can also use the NuGet package MSBuild.Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.targets, referencing them within your Visual Studio project(s), then change your references as Andriy K suggests.The latest Windows SDK, as mentioned above, in addition to the "Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Shell (Integrated) Redistributable Package" for Microsoft.WebApplication.targets and "Microsoft Visual Studio Team System 2008 Database Edition GDR R2" for Microsoft.Data.Schema.SqlTasks.targets should alleviate the need to install Visual Studio 2010. However, installing VS 2010 maybe actually be less overall to download and less work in the end.Goal: no changes / installs necessary to the build agentsI have taken a hybrid approach to the NuGet approach by Lloyd here, which was based off of the committing binary dependencies solution by Andrik.The reason why is I want to be able to add new build agents without having to pre-configure them with items such as this.When I settle into what I think is best in terms of maintenance and being able to spin up new build agents, I\'ll update this post.When building on the build/CI server, turn off the import of Microsoft.WebApplication.targets altogether by specifying /p:VSToolsPath=\'\'. This will, essentially, make the condition of the following line false:\nThis is how it\'s done in TeamCity:If you migrate Visual Studio 2012 to 2013, then open *.csproj project file with edior. \nand check \'Project\' tag\'s ToolsVersion element.Change its value from 4.0 to 12.0FromToOr If you build with msbuild then just specify VisualStudioVersion propertymsbuild /p:VisualStudioVersion=12.0Solution SourceThis is all you need. Only 103MB. Don\'t install everythingI have found this on MS connect:Yes, you need to install Visual Studio\n  2010 on your build machine to build\n  database     projects. Doing so does\n  not require an additional license of\n  Visual Studio.So, this is the only option that I have for now.It seems the new version of msbuild does not ship with Microsoft.WebApplication.targets. To fix you need to update your csproj file as so:1) Edit the web app csproj (right click). Find the section in the csproj towards the bottom concerning build tools. It should look like so.2) You need to add one VSToolsPath line below the VisualStudioVersion tag so it looks like soReference link:\nhttps://alastaircrabtree.com/cannot-open-vs-2015-web-project-in-vs-2017/My solution is a mix of several answers here.I checked the build server, and Windows7/NET4.0 SDK was already installed, so I did find the path:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v9.0\\WebApplications\\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets`However, on this line:<Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v9.0\\WebApplications\\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets" />$(MSBuildExtensionsPath) expands to C:\\Program Files\\MSBuild which does not have the path.Therefore what I did was to create a symlink, using this command:mklink /J "C:\\Program Files\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio" "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio"This way the $(MSBuildExtensionsPath) expands to a valid path, and no changes are needed in the app itself, only in the build server (perhaps one could create the symlink every build, to make sure this step is not lost and is "documented").I fixed this by adding\n/p:VCTargetsPath="C:\\Program Files\\MSBuild\\Microsoft.Cpp\\v4.0\\V120"\n\ninto \nBuild > Build a Visual Studio project or solution using MSBuild > Command Line ArgumentsI tried a bunch of solutions, but in the end this answer worked for me: https://stackoverflow.com/a/19826448/431522It basically entails calling MSBuild from the MSBuild directory, instead of the Visual Studio directory. I also added the MSBuild directory to my path, to make the scripts easier to code. Right now, in 2017, you can install WebApplication redists with MSBuildTools. Just go to this page that will download MSBuild 2017 Tools and while installation click Web development build tools to get these targets installed as well:\nThis will lead to installing missing libraries in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\BuildTools\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v15.0\\WebApplications by defaultI have had sucess copying the files from my dev machine to TFS. They should live in the same location on both machines.
