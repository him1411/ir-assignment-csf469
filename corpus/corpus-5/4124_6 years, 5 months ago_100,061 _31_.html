If I want to merge into a Git branch the changes made only to some of the files changed in a particular commit which includes changes to multiple files, how can this be achieved?Suppose the Git commit called stuff has changes to files A, B, C, and D but I want to merge only stuff\'s changes to files A and B. It sounds like a job for git cherry-pick but cherry-pick only knows how to merge entire commits, not a subset of the files.I\'d do it with cherry-pick -n (--no-commit) which lets you inspect (and modify) the result before committing:If the vast majority of modifications are things you don\'t want, instead of checking out individual paths (the middle step), you could reset everything back, then add in what you want:The other methods didn\'t work for me since the commit had a lot of changes and conflicts to a lot of other files. What I came up with was simplyIt doesn\'t actually do a commit for you so you may need to follow it up withPerhaps the advantage of this method over Jefromi\'s answer is that you don\'t have to remember which behaviour of git reset is the right one :)I usually use the -p flag with a git checkout from the other branch which I find easier and more granular than most other methods I have come across.In principle:example:You then get a dialog asking you which changes you want in "blobs" this pretty much works out to every chunk of continuous code change which you can then signal y (Yes) n (No) etc for each chunk of code.The -p or patch option works for a variety of commands in git including git stash save -p which allows you to choose what you want to stash from your current workI sometimes use this technique when I have done a lot of work and would like to separate it out and commit in more topic based commits using git add -p and choosing what I want for each commit :)Cherry pick is to pick changes from a specific "commit". The simplest solution is to pick all changes of certain files is to use In example:Sources and full explanation http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2009/02/25/git-tip-how-to-merge-specific-files-from-another-branch/UPDATE:With this method, git will not MERGE the file, it will just override any other change done on the destination branch. You will need to merge the changes manually: $ git diff HEAD filenameI would just cherry-pick everything, then do this:Then I would revert the changes I don\'t want, then make a new commit.I found another way which prevents any conflicting merge on cherry-picking which IMO is kind of easy to remember and understand. Since you are actually not cherry-picking a commit, but part of it, you need to split it first and then create a commit which will suit your needs and cherry-pick it.First create a branch from the commit you want to split and checkout it:Then revert previous commit:Then add the files/changes you want to cherry-pick:and commit it:note the commit hash, let\'s call it PICK-SHA and go back to your main branch, master for example forcing the checkout:and cherry-pick the commit:now you can delete the temp branch:There is an ideologically wrong, yet very productive way.This is "incorrect", yet dead simple and allows you to fine tune changes in your editor.
