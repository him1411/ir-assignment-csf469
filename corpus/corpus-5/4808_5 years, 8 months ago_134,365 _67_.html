PIL does support JPEG in my system.Whenever I do an upload, my code is failing with:How can I resolve this?libjpeg-dev is required to be able to process jpegs with pillow (or PIL), so you need to install it and then recompile pillow. It also seems that libjpeg8-dev is needed on Ubuntu 14.04If you\'re still using PIL then you should really be using pillow these days though, so first pip uninstall PIL before following these instructions to switch, or if you have a good reason for sticking with PIL then replace "pillow" with "PIL" in the below).On Ubuntu:If that doesn\'t work, try one of the below, depending on whether you are on 64bit or 32bit Ubuntu.For Ubuntu x64:Or for Ubuntu 32bit:Then reinstall pillow:(Edits to include feedback from comments. Thanks Charles Offenbacher for pointing out this differs for 32bit, and t-mart for suggesting use of --no-cache-dir).For those on OSX, I used the following binary to get libpng and libjpeg installed systemwide:libpng & libjpeg for OSXBecause I already had PIL installed (via pip on a virtualenv), I ran:This resolved the decoder JPEG not available error for me.UPDATE (4/24/14):Newer versions of pip require additional flags to download libraries (including PIL) from external sources. Try the following:See the following answer for additional info: pip install PIL dont install into virtualenvUPDATE 2:If on OSX Mavericks, you\'ll want to set the ARCHFLAGS flag as @RicardoGonzales comments below: This is the only way that worked for me. Installing packages and reinstalling PIL didn\'t work.On ubuntu, install the required package:(you may also want to install libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev zlib1g-dev to enable other decoders).Then replace PIL with pillow:The followed works on ubuntu 12.04:when your see "-- JPEG support avaliable" that means it works.But, if it still doesn\'t work when your edit your jpeg image, check the python path !!\nmy python path missed /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PIL-1.1.7-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/, so I edit the ~/.bashrc add the following code to this file:Edit: export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PIL-1.1.7-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/then, finally, it works!!On Fedora 17 I had to install libjpeg-devel and afterwards reinstall PIL:Rolo\'s answer is excellent, however I had to reinstall Pillow by bypassing pip cache (introduced with pip 7) otherwise it won\'t get properly recompiled!!!\nThe command is:and you can see if Pillow has been properly configured by reading in the logs this:as you can see the support for jpg, tiff and so on is enabled, because I previously installed the required libraries via apt (libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev libfreetype6-dev libtiff-dev)On Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9.3), I solved this by doing the follows:Install libjpeg by brew (package management system)brew install libjpegreinstall pillow (I use pillow instead of PIL)pip install -I pillowInstall these and be sure to install PIL with pip because I compiled it from source and for some reason it didn\'t workI was already using Pillow and got the same error.\nTried installing libjpeg or libjpeg-dev as suggested by others but was told that a (newer) version was already installed.In the end all it took was reinstalling Pillow:I\'m too newbie to comment zeantsoi post ;(. So here his what I needed to do to solved on OSX on 10.9.1 the IOError: decoder jpeg not available1) install Xcode tools (open your terminal and execute:  xcode-select --install) - taken from this post: Can't install PIL after Mac OS X 10.92) install libpng and libjpeg package (combo installer) from this link: http://ethan.tira-thompson.com/Mac_OS_X_Ports.html3) reboot (not sure it was mandatory)4) Re-install PIL with run pip install -I PIL (as I had initially installed PIL before having the issue)Hope this help and don\'t confuse more ..._ohoThis question was posted quite a while ago and most of the answers are quite old too. So when I spent hours trying to figure this out, nothing worked, and I tried all suggestions in this post.I was still getting the standard JPEG errors when trying to upload a JPG in my Django avatar form:Then I checked the repository for Ubuntu 12.04 and noticed some extra packages for libjpeg. I installed these and my problem was solved:Installing these removed libjpeg-dev, libjpeg-turbo8-dev, and libjpeg8-dev.Hope this helps someone in the year 2015 and beyond!CheersSame problem here, JPEG support available but still got IOError: decoder/encoder jpeg not available, except I use Pillow and not PIL.I tried all of the above and more, but after many hours I realized that using sudo pip install does not work as I expected, in combination with virtualenv. Silly me.Using sudo effectively launches the command in a new shell (my understanding of this may not be entirely correct) where the virtualenv is not activated, meaning that the packages will be installed in the global environment instead. (This messed things up, I think I had 2 different installations of Pillow.)I cleaned things up, changed user to root and reinstalled in the virtualenv and now it works.\nHopefully this will help someone!For FedoraInstall  pre-requisite \nsudo dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel rpm-build libjpeg-devel zlib-devel python-devel\n \n\nNow install Pillowsudo pip install pillowNote - For libjpeg and zlib we are installing libjpeg-devel and zlib-devel packages in Fedora/CentOS/Red Hat First I had to delete the python folders in hidden folder user/appData (that was creating huge headaches), in addition to uninstalling Python.  Then I installed WinPython Distribution: http://code.google.com/p/winpython/ which includes PILFor those on Mac OS Mountain Lion, I followed the anwser of zeantsoi, but it doesn\'t work.I finally ended up with the solution of this post: http://appelfreelance.com/2010/06/libjpeg-pil-snow-leopard-python2-6-_jpeg_resync_to_restart/Now, I\'m happily running my script for jpeg !
