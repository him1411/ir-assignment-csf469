I get this error when trying to access localhost via a browser.I checked my site folder permissions using:Here is my configuration file:If you are using Apache 2.4You have to check allow and deny rulesCheck out http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html#accessIn 2.2, access control based on client hostname, IP address, and other\n  characteristics of client requests was done using the directives\n  Order, Allow, Deny, and Satisfy.In 2.4, such access control is done in the same way as other\n  authorization checks, using the new module mod_authz_host.The new directive is Require:2.2 configuration:2.4 configuration:Also don\'t forget to restart the apache server after these changes (# service httpd restart)For all directories write Require all granted instead of Allow from all\nUpdateIf the above doesn\'t work then also remove this below mentioned line:Order allow,denyDouble check that the DocumentRoot path is correct. That can cause this error. I made the same changes that ravisorg suggested to OSX 10.10 Yosemite that upgrades Apache to version 2.4. Below are the changes that were added to http.conf.This drove me absolutely nuts for a day an a half but I found a solution if all other solutions have been tried unsuccessfully. At that point I immediately stopped getting 403 errors and everything started working as expected. Weird thing is i didn\'t even have to restart apache it just worked, i guess it restarted itself when i went to my localhost, I honestly don\'t know but I guess the problem is Apache not actually restarting when using apachectl restart, or stop or start. Hope this helps someone. If you tail the error log and reload the page, you should see some more information as to the exact problem.Grab the environment variables so ${APACHE_LOG_DIR} will actually work...Then tail and watch...I got resolved my self after spending couple of hours.I installed Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) through coookbook in vagrant vm./etc/apache2/apache2.conf file does not have <VirtualHost *:80> element by default.I did two changes to get it donethen finally I just booted vm.. Has anyone thought about that wamp server default not include the httpd-vhosts.conf file.\nMy approach is to remove the note belowin httpd.conf file.\nThat is all.This was driving me crazy. Finally figured out what the problem was:\nI was using direct paths for the error log and they were wrong. Why does Apache give a vague (and wrong) error message? Instead use a correct and useful error message like: Path for ErrorLog directive "/wrong/path/and/filename.log" is invalid.Anyway, to fix make sure your error log directives look something like this: If you have https host then don\'t forget to make Require all granted changes for ssl config too.Also, sometimes it\'s useful to check permissions as the apache user:For Wamp 3 (Apache 2.4), besides putting the server online as described in the other answers, in the Virtual Hosts file conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\nyou might need to replace with\nThis is applicable if in httpd.conf you haveThe problem is in VirtualHost but probablely is not Require all grantedConfirm your config is correct,here is correct sample\n
