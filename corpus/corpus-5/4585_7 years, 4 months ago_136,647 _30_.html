Is it possible to paste in insert mode in vim?While in insert mode hit CTRL-R {register}.  For example, CTRL-R * will insert in the contents of the clipboard and CTRL-R " (the unnamed register) inserts the the last delete or yank.  To find this in vim\'s help type :h i_ctrl-rIf you don\'t want Vim to mangle formatting in incoming pasted text, you might also want to consider using: :set paste  This will prevent vim from re-tabbing your code. When done pasting, :set nopaste will return to the normal behavior.It\'s also possible to toggle the mode with a single key, by adding something like set pastetoggle=<F2> to your .vimrc.  More details on toggling auto-indent here.No not directly.  What you can do though is quickly exit insert mode for a single normal mode  operation with Ctrl-O and then paste from there which will end by putting you back in insert mode. Key Combo: Ctrl-O pEDIT: Interesting. It does appear that there is a way as several other people have listed.While in insert mode, you can use Ctrl-R {register}, where register can be:Ctrl-R {register} inserts the text as if it were typed.Ctrl-R Ctrl-O {register} inserts the text with the original indentation.Ctrl-R Ctrl-P {register} inserts the text and auto-indents it.Ctrl-O can be used to run any normal mode command before returning to insert mode, so  Ctrl-O "+p can also be used, for example.For more information, view the documentation with :h i_ctrl-rYou can use this to nicely paste from clipboard with Ctrlv:And this for yanking visual selection into clipboard with Ctrlc:If you also want to use clipboard by default for classic vim yanking/pasting (y/p) in normal mode, here is a config option that does it:With this configs you can e.g. yank first in normal mode and then paste with Ctrlv in insert mode. Also, you can paste text from different vim instances and different applications without any hassle. For pasting from custom registers you can follow the other answers:).If you set vim to use the system clipboard (:set clipboard=unnamed), then any text you copy in vim can be pasted using Shift+Insert. Shift+Insert is simply an OS-wide paste key-combo (Ctrl+insert is the corresponding \'copy\')You can also use mouse middle button to paste in insert mode(Linux only).You can enter -- INSERT (past) -- mode via:oronce in -- INSERT (past) -- mode simply use your systems paste function (e.g. CtrlShiftv on Linux, Cmdv on Mac OS).This strategy is very usefully when using vim over ssh.Yes.  In Windows Ctrl+V and in Linux pressing both mouse buttons nearly simultaneously.In Windows I think this line in my _vimrc probably does it:In Linux I don\'t remember how I did it.  It looks like I probably deleted some line from the default .vimrc file.A custom map seems appropriate in this case. This is what I use to paste yanked items in insert mode:My Leader key here is \\; this means hitting \\p in insert mode would paste the previously yanked items/lines.
