I read here Learn C Before Objective-C?Usually I then replace some Obj-C code with pure C code (after all you can mix them as much as you like, the content of an Obj-C method can be entirely, pure C code)Is this true? Is it possible to build an iPhone app purely in the C programming language?Damn, it took me a while but I got it:main.c:AppDelegate.c:View.cIt\'s ugly, but it works.If you would like to download this, you can get it from my dropbox hereYou can get it from my GitHub repository here:Objective-C is a superset of the C-language, so it is theoretically possible to write a program entirely in C, however, unless you are thoroughly versed in OpenGL ES, You\'ll need to do at least some objC (Even Rich\'s sample has a const NSString* in it), else you\'ll have to write the views yourself.OK, the above is completely wrong.  Let me say, I\'m astounded Rich achieved this lofty goal, so I ported it over to the mac (source here).  The files below have no headers, do not link to Cocoa, nor does the project have a nib:AppDelegate.mView.mprefix.pchI read here Learn C Before Objective-C?Usually I then replace some Obj-C code with pure C code (after all you can mix them as much as you like, the content of an Obj-C method can be entirely, pure C code)Is this true?Could I build an iPhone app purely in the C programming language?The quoted passage is true, but the answer to your question is no.To illustrate what answerer Mecki on that other question was talking about:There is nothing but pure C code within this method, but the method itself is Objective-C code, as is the class that contains this method.So it is possible to do what Mecki said, but you can\'t (practically\xe2\x80\x94as Richard J. Ross III showed, it\'s technically possible but quite a lot of typing) write a whole Cocoa Touch program in pure C.Actually, some of the code posted here, while written in C, is still calling objective-C code :). I don\'t know if that actually fits the scenario from the original poster when he asked Is it possible to build an iPhone app purely in the C programming\n  language?but I would agree with the people saying that, generally speaking and for an app with a GUI, you would need to write your GUI in OpenGL (which is C).I think that is what most games do, right? Although I\'m not sure if there\'s access to the iPhone\'s I/O (the touchscreen for example) in C.Last but not least, the guys that wrote the code above rock! :)
