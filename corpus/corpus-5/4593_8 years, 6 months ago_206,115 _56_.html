Is it possible to detect "idle" time in JavaScript?\nMy primary use case probably would be to pre-fetch or preload content.Idle time: Period of user inactivity or without any CPU usageHere is a simple script using JQuery that handles mousemove and keypress events.\nIf the time expires, the page reload.Without using jQuery, only JavaScript:Credits: http://forums.devshed.com/javascript-development-115/alert-time-inactivity-click-logout-501444.htmlYou can add more DOM events if you need to. Most used are:DOM Events list: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.aspRemember use window, or document according your needs. Here you can see the differences between them: What is the difference between window, screen, and document in Javascript?I have created a small lib that does this a year ago:https://github.com/shawnmclean/Idle.jsDescription:Tiny javascript library to report activity of user in the browser\n  (away, idle, not looking at webpage, in a different tab, etc). that is independent of any\n  other javascript libraries such as jquery.Visual Studio users can get it from NuGet by: PM> Install-Package Idle.jsImproving on Equiman\'s answer: .\nApart from the improvements regarding activity detection, and the change from document to window, this script is actually called, rather than sitting idle by. Here is a rough jQuery implementation of tvanfosson\'s idea:Similar to Iconic\'s solution above (with jQuery custom event)...You can do it more elegantly with underscore and jquery-You could probably hack something together by detecting mouse movement on the body of the form and updating a global variable with the last movement time.  You\'d then need to have an interval timer running that periodically checks the last movement time and does something if it has been sufficiently long since the last mouse movement was detected.I know it a relatively old question, but I had the same issue and I found a quite good solution.I used: jquery.idle\nand I only needed to do:See JsFiddle demo.(Just for Info: see this for back-end event tracking Leads browserload)Try this its work perfect..I think this jquery code is perfect one , though copied and modified from above answers!!\ndonot forgot to include jquery library in your file!All the previous answers have an always-active mousemove handler.  If the handler is jQuery, the additional processing jQuery performs can add up.  Especially if the user is using a gaming mouse, as many as 500 events per second can occur.This solution avoids handling every mousemove event.  This result in a small timing error, but which you can adjust to your need.http://jsfiddle.net/q8wLuLbw/My answer was inspired by vijay\'s answer, but is a shorter, more general solution that I thought I\'d share for anyone it might help.As it currently stands, this code will execute immediately and reload your current page after 3 minutes of no mouse movement or key presses.This utilizes plain vanilla JavaScript and an immediately-invoked function expression to handle idle timeouts in a clean and self-contained manner.I wrote a simple jQuery plugin that will do what you are looking for.https://github.com/afklondon/jquery.inactivityThe script will listen for mouse, keyboard, touch and other custom events inactivity (idle) and fire global "activity" and "inactivity" events.Hope this helps :)If you are targeting Chrome you can experiment with the requestIdleCallbackPure JavaScript with properly set reset time and bindings via addEventListenerI have tested this code working file:        The problem with all these solutions, although correct, they are impractical, when taking into account the session timeout valuable set, using PHP, .NET or in the Application.cfc file for Coldfusion developers. The time set by the above solution needs to sync with the server side session timeout. If the two do not sync, you can run into problems that will just frustrate and confuse your users. For example, the server side session timeout might be set to 60 minutes, but the user may believe that he/she is safe, because the JavaScript idle time capture has increased the total amount of time a user can spend on a single page. The user may have spent time filling in a long form, and then goes to submit it. The session timeout might kick in before the form submission is processed. I tend to just give my users 180 minutes, and then use JavaScript to automatically log the user out. Essentially, using some of the code above, to create a simple timer, but without the capturing mouse event part. In this way my client side & server side time syncs perfectly. There is no confusion, if you show the time to the user in your UI, as it reduces. Each time a new page is accessed in the CMS, the server side session & JavaScript timer are reset. Simple & elegant. If a user stays on a single page for more than 180 minutes, I figure there is something wrong with the page, in the first place.Here is the best solution I have found: \nhttp://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/fire-event-when-user-is-idle/Here is the JS:I use this approach, since you don\'t need to constantly reset the time when an event fires, instead we just record the time, this generates the idle start point.You could probably detect inactivity on your web page using the mousemove tricks listed, but that won\'t tell you that the user isn\'t on another page in another window or tab, or that the user is in Word or Photoshop, or WOW and just isn\'t looking at your page at this time. Generally I\'d just do the prefetch and rely on the client\'s multi-tasking. If you really need this functionality you do something with an activex control in windows, but it\'s ugly at best.Here is an AngularJS service for accomplishing in Angular.Keep in mind this idle checker will run for all routes, so it should be initialized in .run() on load of the angular app.  Then you can use idleChecker.secondsIdle inside each route.You can use the below mentioned solutionJust a few thoughts, an avenue or two to explore.Is it possible to have a function run every 10 seconds, and have that check a "counter" variable?  If that\'s possible, you can have an on mouseover for the page, can you not?  If so, use the mouseover event to reset the "counter" variable.  If your function is called, and the counter is above the range that you pre-determine, then do your action.Again, just some thoughts...\nHope it helps.Well you could attach a click or mousemove event to the document body that resets a timer. Have a function that you call at timed intervals that checks if the timer is over a specified time (like 1000 millis) and start your preloading.For other users with the same problem. Here is a function i just made up.It does NOT run on every mouse movement the user makes, or clears a timer every time the mouse moves.Tried @freddoo solution but it didn\'t work for 1 minute timeouts so I\'ve changed it slightly to record the date+time when the user last clicked on the page and in my timerIncrement function I calculate the difference between the current time and the last clicked time and if the value happens to be bigger or equal to the timeout value then I redirect:Javascript has no way of telling the CPU usage.  This would break the sandbox javascript runs inside.Other than that, hooking the page\'s onmouseover and onkeydown events would probably work.You could also set use setTimeout in the onload event to schedule a function to be called after a delay.
