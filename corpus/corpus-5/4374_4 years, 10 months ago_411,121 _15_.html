How to read a file line by line in PHP, without completely loading it in memory?My file is too large to open in memory so I always got memory exhaust errors.The file size is 1Gb.You can use the fgets() function to read the file line by line:You can use an object oriented interface class  for a file - SplFileObject http://php.net/manual/en/splfileobject.fgets.php (PHP 5 >= 5.1.0)Use buffering techniques to read the file.There is a file() function that returns an array of the lines contained in the file.If you\'re opening a big file, you probably want to use Generators alongside fgets() to avoid loading the whole file into memory:Use it like this:This way you can process individual file lines inside the foreach().Note: Generators require >= PHP 5.5Be careful with the \'while(!feof ... fgets()\' stuff, fgets can get an error (returnfing false) and loop forever without reaching the end of file.  codaddict was closest to being correct but when your \'while fgets\' loop ends, check feof; if not true, then you had an error.One of the popular solutions to this question will have issues with the new line character. It can be fixed pretty easy with a simple str_replace.This how I manage with very big file (tested with up to 100G). And it\'s faster than fgets()Function to Read with array return
