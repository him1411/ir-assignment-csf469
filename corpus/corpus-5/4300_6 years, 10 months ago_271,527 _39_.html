I want my app to recognize when a user swipes from right to left on the phone screen.How to do this?OnSwipeTouchListener.java:Usage:This code detects left and right swipes, avoids deprecated API calls, and has other miscellaneous improvements over earlier answers.Use it like this:If you also need to process click events here some modifications:And sample usage:Expanding on Mirek\'s answer, for the case when you want to use the swipe gestures inside a scroll view. By default the touch listener for the scroll view get disabled and therefore scroll action does not happen. In order to fix this you need to override the dispatchTouchEvent method of the Activity and return the inherited version of this method after you\'re done with your own listener.In order to do a few modifications to Mirek\'s code:\nI add a getter for the gestureDetector in the OnSwipeTouchListener.Declare the OnSwipeTouchListener inside the Activity as a class-wide field.Modify the usage code accordingly:And override the dispatchTouchEvent method inside Activity:Now both scroll and swipe actions should work.In order to have Click Listener, DoubleClick Listener, OnLongPress Listener, Swipe Left, Swipe Right, Swipe Up, Swipe Down on Single View you need to setOnTouchListener. i.e,For this you need OnSwipeTouchListener class that implements OnTouchListener.Use SwipeListView and let it handle the gesture detection for you.To add an onClick as well, here\'s what I did.I\'m using Fragments, so using getActivity() for context. This is how I implemented it - and it works.@Edward Brey\'s method works great. If someone would also like to copy & paste the imports for the OnSwipeTouchListener, here they are:Needs some minor updates. Variables are mismatched in the onTouch method, and exception class is not imported. Would make more sense to just return false from onFling(), instead of initiating a variable, assigning it a value, doing nothing with it, and just returning it.Some parts of onTouch method are incorrect. See view/motionEvent cannot be resolved to a variable swipeOne helpful tip that would\'ve saved me some time and I hope may help others: when you use this method, you only want to add the "implements" tag to your OnSwipeTouchListener class. Your Activity and View are not implementing it. They are just taking advantage of your class that already does!+1 for Mirek because his code still gave me what I needed for mine :)A little modification of @Mirek Rusin answer and now you can detect multitouch swipes. This code is on Kotlin:Where Gesture.SWIPE_RIGHT and others are unique integer indentificator of gesture that I`m using to detect kind of gesture later in my activity:So you see gesture here is an integer variable that holds value I have passed before.@Mirek Rusin answeir is very good.\nBut, there is small bug, and fix is requried -What the difference? We set result = true, only if we have checked that all requrinments (both SWIPE_THRESHOLD  and SWIPE_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD are Ok ). This is important if we discard swipe if some of requrinments are not achieved, and we have to do smth in onTouchEvent method of OnSwipeTouchListener!Here is simple Android Code for detecting gesture directionIn MainActivity.java and activity_main.xml, write the following code:MainActivity.javaactivity_main.xmlThe last impl works only with this:If you want to display some buttons with actions when an list item is swipe are a lot of libraries on the internet that have this behavior.\nI implemented the library that I found on the internet and I am very satisfied. It is very simple to use and very quick. I improved the original library and I added a new click listener for item click. Also I added font awesome library (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and now you can simply add a new item title and specify the icon name from font awesome.Here is the github linkYou don\'t need those complicated calculations.\njust using GestureDetector in its OnGestureListener inside onFling:the usage of Edward Brey\'s answer in Kotlin
