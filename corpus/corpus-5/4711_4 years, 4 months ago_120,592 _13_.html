In rails >4.0.0 generators creates CRUD operations with before_action not before_filter. It seems to do the same thing. So what\'s the difference between these two? As we can see in ActionController::Base, before_action is just a new syntax for before_filter.However all before_filters syntax are deprecated in Rails 5.0 and will be removed in Rails 5.1It is just syntax difference, in rails app there is CRUD, and seven actions basically by name index, new, create, show, update, edit, destroy.Rails 4 make it developer friendly to change syntax before filter to before action.before_action call method before the actions which we declare, likeset_event is a method which will call always before show, update, edit and destroy.It is just a name change. before_action is more specific, because it gets executed before an action.To figure out what is the difference between before_action and before_filter, we should understand the difference between action and filter.An action is a method of a controller to which you can route to.\nFor example, your user creation page might be routed to UsersController#new - new is the action in this route.Filters run in respect to controller actions - before, after or around them.\nThese methods can halt the action processing by redirecting or set up common data to every action in the controller.Rails 4 \xe2\x80\x93> _actionRails 3 \xe2\x80\x93> _filter
