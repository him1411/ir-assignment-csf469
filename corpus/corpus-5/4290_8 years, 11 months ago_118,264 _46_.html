I\'m trying to convert some strings that are in French Canadian and basically, I\'d like to be able to take out the French accent marks in the letters while keeping the letter. (E.g. convert \xc3\xa9 to e, so cr\xc3\xa8me br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e would become creme brulee)What is the best method for achieving this?I\'ve not used this method, but Michael Kaplan describes a method for doing so in his blog post (with a confusing title) that talks about stripping diacritics: Stripping is an interesting job (aka\nOn the meaning of meaningless, aka All\nMn characters are non-spacing, but\nsome are more non-spacing than\nothers)Note that this is a followup to his earlier post: Stripping diacritics.... The approach uses String.Normalize to split the input string into constituent glyphs (basically separating the "base" characters from the diacritics) and then scans the result and retains only the base characters. It\'s just a little complicated, but really you\'re looking at a complicated problem.Of course, if you\'re limiting yourself to French, you could probably get away with the simple table-based approach in How to remove accents and tilde in a C++ std::string, as recommended by @David Dibben.this did the trick for me...quick&short!In case someone is interested, I was looking for something similar and ended writing the following:In case anyone\'s interested, here is the java equivalent:I often use an extenstion method based on another version I found here\n(see Replacing characters in C# (ascii))\nA quick explanation:Code:I needed something that converts all major unicode characters and the voted answer leaved a few out so I\'ve created a version of CodeIgniter\'s convert_accented_characters($str) into C# that is easily customisable:UsageThe CodePage of Greek (ISO) can do itThe information about this codepage is into System.Text.Encoding.GetEncodings(). Learn about in: https://msdn.microsoft.com/pt-br/library/system.text.encodinginfo.getencoding(v=vs.110).aspxGreek (ISO) has codepage 28597 and name iso-8859-7.Go to the code... \\o/So, write this function...Note that... Encoding.GetEncoding("iso-8859-7") is equivalent to Encoding.GetEncoding(28597) because first is the name, and second the codepage of Encoding.This works fine in java. It basically converts all accented characters into their deAccented counterparts followed by their combining diacritics. Now you can use a regex to strip off the diacritics.THIS IS THE VB VERSION (Works with GREEK) :Imports System.TextImports System.GlobalizationThis is how i replace diacritic characters to non-diacritic ones in all my .NET programC#:VB .NET:you can use string extension from MMLib.Extensions nuget package:Nuget page: https://www.nuget.org/packages/MMLib.Extensions/\nCodeplex project site https://mmlib.codeplex.com/Try HelperSharp package.There is a method RemoveAccents:What this person said:Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.GetEncoding(1251).GetBytes(text));It actually splits the likes of \xc3\xa5 which is one character (which is character code 00E5, not 0061 plus the modifier 030A which would look the same) into a plus some kind of modifier, and then the ASCII conversion removes the modifier, leaving the only a.It\'s funny such a question can get so many answers, and yet none fit my requirements :) There are so many languages around, a full language agnostic solution is AFAIK not really possible, as others has mentionned that the FormC or FormD are giving issues.Since the original question was related to French, the simplest working answer is indeed 1251 should be replaced by the encoding code of the input language.This however replace only one character by one character. Since I am also working with German as input, I did a manual convertIt might not deliver the best performance, but at least it is very easy to read and extend.\nRegex is a NO GO, much slower than any char/string stuff.I also have a very simple method to remove space:Eventually, I am using a combination of all 3 above extensions:And a small unit test to that (not exhaustive) which pass successfully.Popping this Library here if you haven\'t already considered it. Looks like there are a full range of unit tests with it. https://github.com/thomasgalliker/Diacritics.NETI really like the concise and functional code provided by azrafe7.\nSo, I have changed it a little bit to convert it to an extension method:
