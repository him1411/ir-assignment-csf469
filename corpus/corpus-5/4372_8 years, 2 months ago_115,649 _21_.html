I\'m checking out some PHP 5.3.0 features and ran across some code on the site that looks quite funny:as one of the examples on anonymous functions.Does anybody know about this? Any documentation? And it looks evil, should it ever be used?This is how PHP expresses a closure.  This is not evil at all and in fact it is quite powerful and useful.  Basically what this means is that you are allowing the anonymous function to "capture" local variables (in this case, $tax and a reference to $total) outside of it scope and preserve their values (or in the case of $total the reference to $total itself) as state within the anonymous function itself.A simpler answer.function ($quantity) use ($tax, &$total) { .. };As @Mytskine pointed out probably the best in-depth explanation is the RFC for closures. (Upvote him for this.)closures are beautiful! they solve a lot of problems that come with anonymous functions, and make really elegant code possible (at least as long as we talk about php).javascript programmers use closures all the time, sometimes even without knowing it, because bound variables aren\'t explicitly defined - that\'s what "use" is for in php.there are better real-world examples than the above one. lets say you have to sort an multidimensional array by a sub-value, but the key changes.warning: untested code (i don\'t have php5.3 installed atm), but it should look like something like that.there\'s one downside: a lot of php developers may be a bit helpless if you confront them with closures.to understand the nice-ty of closures more, i\'ll give you another example - this time in javascript. one of the problems is the scoping and the browser inherent asynchronity. especially, if it comes to window.setTimeout(); (or -interval). so, you pass a function to setTimeout, but you can\'t really give any parameters, because providing parameters executes the code!myFunction returns a function with a kind-of predefined parameter!to be honest, i like php a lot more since 5.3 and anonymous functions/closures. namespaces may be more important, but they\'re a lot less sexy.The function () use () {} is closure for PHP, you must use use to include variable of parent function.Zupa did a great job explaining closures with \'use\' and the difference between EarlyBinding and Referencing the variables that are \'used\'. So I made a code example with early binding of a variable (= copying):  Example with referencing a variable (notice the \'&\' character before variable);The scope of $tax and $total is within the function getTotal(). You are calling the callback function inside it. So there is no need to call use.
