I got an error when archiving a project. This is my environment.The project deployment target is:The error shows:I guess Pods is CocoaPods that I used to manage XCode project dependencies.\nhttps://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPodsThis is my Podfile  I am not sure what the error means?Are you opening the workspace (that was generated by CocoaPods) instead of the xcodeproj?I separated the app and the test targets in the Podfile by usingThis resulted in two new products libPods-App.a and libPods-AppTests.a, respectively and they made the previous product libPods.a obsolete. I had to remove this product from the Link Binary With Libraries Section of the Build Phases configuration of both targets. I ran into a similar problem today.Now when compiling on this new Preview configuration, the compiler would not be able to link with Pods and giving me this message:What I had to do was to runagain and thus configuring cocoapods for the new Preview configuration. It updated my project, the workspace and the Pod\'s project file and the problem disappearedBe sure that you open .xcworkspace, not .xcodeprojNot a solution worked for me, this is really unbearable, there\'s a file libpods.a(which was red coloured) I removed it and everything working fine! Cheers to me ;)I had divided my pod listings in the Podfile for different targets like:And ran a pod installThis created a new library libPods-ABC.a to which my binary had to link to. But the bug was that it didn\'t delete the previous library i.e. libPods.a.Solution : Remove the library libPods.a from Build Phases of Link Binary With Libraries.if you are running into problems with this on cocoapods v25 / Xcode 5 The Pods Xcode project now sets the ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH build setting to YES in the Debug configuration. You will have to set the same on your project/target, otherwise the build will fail.https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/FAQ#running-into-build-failures-after-migrating-to-xcode-5-and-cocoapods-0250UPDATE \nMake sure you have latest gems / cocoapodsYou will want to rebuild project using \nPod Install to rebuild project.If Xcode complains when linking, e.g. Library not found for -lPods, it doesn\'t detect the implicit dependencies.Go to Product > Edit Scheme\nClick on Build\nAdd the Pods static library, and make sure it\'s at the top of the list\nClean and build again\nIf that doesn\'t work, verify that the source for the spec you are trying to include has been pulled from github. Do this by looking in /Pods/. If it is empty (it should not be), verify that the ~/.cocoapods/master//.podspec has the correct git hub url in it.\nIf still doesn\'t work, check your XCode build locations settings. Go to Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data -> Advanced and set build location to \xe2\x80\x9cRelative to Workspace\xe2\x80\x9d.http://docs.cocoapods.org/guides/getting_started.htmlI had an old libPod.a file specified (probably caused by me changing targets).Project Settings -> Build Phases -> Link Binary with LibrariesUsually, cocoapods would only include one library, such as libPods-target.a or libPods.a. I solved it by removing the duplicate.I had the same problem when I edited the Podfile adding the target which I was using without a target before.After wondering around I found that under target properties >> General tab >> Linked Frameworks and Libraries section, There were the new libPods-xxxx.a and the old one libPods.aI just removed libPods.a and everything worked fine. CocoaPods\' wiki on GitHub has the answer right in their FAQ:Using ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO in all pods solved the problem for me. To make this persistent, I added a post_install hook to my Podfile:pod install and you\'re done.I was renaming the project to "NBSelector" from "Partners".I had "Library not found for libPods-Partners" error after renaming the project. Xcode was trying to link to old Partners.a file. Just remove it if you have podInstalled after renaming.Did you create \'Distribution\' or similar configuration to make Ad-Hoc and App Store archives?\nLike many others I followed Apple\'s recommendations and dubbed \'Release\' configuration, called it \'Distribution\' and set different signing rules to it. Well, maybe that was a recommendation before they introduced schemes and "Distribute" option in Organizer, anyway, I just had it from before.Then I had same problem with Pods. It all worked well when debugging, but archiving failed with link error. After trying this and that I changed Archive configuration of my original project from \'Distribution\' to \'Release\' and the link error was gone.Yet the archive did not show up in Organizer, though I could locate it in file system, but it had 0 size.Final step to fix all this was to change "Skip Install" setting for \'Release\' configuration to "NO". Note, that you have to do this only for your main project, but not for Pods project. Better leave Pods project as is, since it\'s generated every time you run \'pod install\'.Update\nJust got an answer from CocoaPods devs\nIt doesn\'t seem to work for me, since I had Pods configuration properly set.\nBut it could help someone else.In my case the problem was that Xcode\'s Derived Data location was set to the "Legacy" option. The CocoaPods target (libPods.a) was being built correctly, but Xcode was looking in the wrong place for it.Switching it to "Unique" (the default) solved the issue. You can do this by going to Preferences > Locations and clicking the Advanced... button.Only adding the "Library Search Paths" (in Build Settings of \'MyProject\') to "Pods/build/Debug-iphonesimulator" worked for me (when using the simulator).Got it from here:\nhttps://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/121#issuecomment-5452473If you are Archiving for iOS7 and Xcode5 and got these errors, please refer to this link. It seems like Apple is dropping an architecture that cocoa pods needed\nhttps://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/1352I found that selecting "Find implicit Dependencies" (under product / edit scheme) will resolve this issue instead of having to add pods as a target.I went through every answer on here, but for me it was insanely simple...Go to Target -> Build Phases, then remove libPods-YourProject.a, then add it again using the "+". Don\'t worry about the library being red, it\'s fine.Solved it by taking the steps below: In my case pod install fixed the problem, after creating distribution and release schemes.I used old cocoapod version after update the cocoapods it suggest me to update my installed pod because of major update as i update after long time. I update it and new version pods was updated fine. But after that i got the error like library not found for -lPods-xxxprojectName-xxxxxpodNameAfter tried so many solutions given as answer of in this thred, non of this worked for me. Then i went to my project setting and found that pods path was change which was on Other Linker FlagCheck your Manage Schemes for correct pod name and compare it in Other Linker Flag, Change it if not similarOld pod path was -l"lPods-xxxprojectName-xxxxxpodName"But new pods was only xxxxxpodName so i replaced Other Linker Flag with new one like belowChanged to pod path -l"xxxxxpodName" and it\'s worked.I don\'t know the perfect reason behind this but might be this help some one. I got the same problem when archiving for submit. \nDiscussion on this issue can be found here: https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/155In summary, two methods work for me:Using Xcode 5 with iOS 7This is what I did after being stuck for an hour. Remove ARM64 from the Build Setting > Valid Architecture. ADDED: Also, for my case, it was not derived data location. I chose unique for build location. if You\'re using iOS7 and Xcode 5, do:I tried EVERY answer in this thread to no avail.  Finally resolved my issue by matching the "Pre-Configuration Build Products Path" in my target project with the value in the Pods project.  Turns out they were building to two different output locations.  None of the other suggestions in this thread were relevant for me.  Would be great if XCode gave a useful error description (like WHY it can\'t use the lib - File Not Found, No matching architecture found, etc.).In this issue,If you have already installed & update pod in your system then your Xcode not being able to find the Pods library.To resolve this issue, please check for following causes that may take place:try link_with \'YouTarget1\', \'YouTarget2\' ...My project worked, the targets suddenly stopped compiling. Then added "link_with" and returned to normal. Apparently, now it just connects to the first target, is what the link says:http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#link_withtry open xcworkspace file instead of xcodeproj fileIn my case nr 4 of the FAQ in this link helped out:\nhttps://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/Creating-a-project-that-uses-CocoaPodsThere are a couple of additional things you can try out if the problem persists.
