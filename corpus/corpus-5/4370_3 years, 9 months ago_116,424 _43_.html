Using Android Gradle plugin 0.7.0 with the following build.gradle:gives the error Duplicate files copied in APK META-INF/LICENSE.txt:Things were working fine this morning before I updated Android Studio. Any ideas?EDIT: I was able to temporarily fix it by running commands likeuntil all the duplicate errors went away.You should add:to your build.gradle file.According to comment 14 in this bug: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36982149#comment14 this is a bug in v0.7.0 of the Android Gradle plugin, and is due to be fixed soon in 0.7.1.Here are the notes from that bug about the addition for 0.7.1:0.7.1 is out with the fix for this.The DSL to exclude files is:You can add as many exclude statement as you want. The value is the archive path. No wildcard or glob support yet.Filenames "LICENSE.txt" and "NOTICE.txt" are case sensitive. Please try out with "license.txt" and "notice.txt" as well.In my case I had to include several additional exclusions.  It appears it doesn\'t like Regular expressions which would\'ve made this a nice one-liner.From Gradle 0.9.1 the following is supported:More information in the Gradle release notes.The same problem  when I export the library httclient-4.3.5 in Android Studio 0.8.6\nI need include this:The library zip content the next jar:This bug still exists in  0.8+/1.10 With JacksonI had to include as well as the above suggestion before it would compile    It\'s more than one errorUnder apply plugin: \'android-library\'add this ::In case of duplicate files it\'s easy, look inside the JAR under the META-INF dir and see what\'s causing the error. It could be multiple. In my case Couchbase Lite plugin.\nAs you add more plugins, you will need more exceptionsThe same problem when I used \'org.springframework.android:spring-android-rest-template:2.0.0.M1\' in Android Studio 1.0.1. I need include this in build.gradleThis works for me:I think you need to include only these options in build.gradle:p.s same answer from my post in : \nError :: duplicate files during packaging of APKI noticed this commit comment in AOSP, the solution will be to exclude some files using DSL. Probably when 0.7.1 is released. The problem is that the META-INF folder won\'t get filtered so multiple entries of NOTICE or LICENSE cause duplicates when building and it is tryed to copy them together.Dirty Quick Fix:Open the .jar file in your .gradle/caches/... folder (with a zip compatible tool) and remove or rename the files in the META-INF folder that cause the error (usally NOTICE or LICENSE).\n(I know thats also in the OP, but for me it was not really clear until I read the google forum)EDIT:This was fixed in 0.7.1. Just add the confilcting files to exclude.Same here withI lost like 2 days for that weird error... Why is this still happening in gradle 1.0.0 ? That is very disturbing for newbies...\nAnyway, thanks for that info i thought it was on my code :)Important to know in what file it comes to this error (in you example it is META-INF/LICENSE.txt) , in my case it was in META-INF/LICENSE [without ".txt"], and then in the file META-INF/ASL2.0 so I added to my build.gradle this lines:Very important (!) -> add the name of the file in the same style, that you see it in the error message: the text is case sensitive, and there is a difference between *.txt and *(without "txt").       In my case I only need to add to project\'s build.gradle file:In Android Studio 1.1.0 i needed lower case names:Files "LICENSE.txt" and "NOTICE.txt" are case sensitive. So for SPring android library I had to add Removing .txt after LICENSE removed my error :
