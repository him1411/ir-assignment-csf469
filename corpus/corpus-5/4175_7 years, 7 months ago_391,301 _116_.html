I am using jQuery date picker to display the calendar all over my app. I want to know if I can use it to display the month and year (May 2010) and not the calendar?Here\'s a hack (updated with entire .html file):EDIT\njsfiddle for the above example:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/DBpJe/7755/EDIT 2\nAdds the month year value to input box only on clicking of Done button.\nAlso allows to delete input box values, which isn\'t possible in above field\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/DBpJe/5103/EDIT 3\nupdated Better Solution based on rexwolf\'s solution down.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/DBpJe/5106 This code is working flawlessly to me:Output is:@Ben Koehler, that\'s prefect! I made a minor modification so that using a single instance of the date picker more than once works as expected. Without this modification the date is parsed incorrectly and the previously selected date is not highlighted.The above answers are pretty good. My only complaint is that you can\'t clear the value once it\'s been set. Also I prefer the extend-jquery-like-a-plugin approach.This works perfect for me:Then invoke like so:This will solve the problem =) But I wanted the timeFormat yyyy-mmOnly tried in FF4 thoughI had this same need today and found this on github, works with jQueryUI and has month picker in place of days in calendarhttps://github.com/thebrowser/jquery.ui.monthpickerHere\'s what I came up with.  It hides the calendar without needing an extra style block and adds a clear button to deal with the problem of not being able to clear the value once you click on the input.  Also works nicely with multiple monthpickers on the same page.HTML:JavaScript:I needed a Month/Year picker for two fields (From & To) and when one was chosen the Max/Min was set on the other one...a la picking airline ticket dates.\nI was having issues setting the max and min...the dates of the other field would get erased.  Thanks to several of the above posts...I finally figured it out. You have to set options and dates in a very specific order.  See this fiddle for the full solution: Month/Year Picker @ JSFiddleCode:Also add this to a style block as mentioned above:I combined many of above good answers and arrive on this:This is proved working but facing many bugs so I was forced to patch in several places of datepicker:patch1:  in _showDatepicker : to smooth the hide;patch2:  in _checkOffset: to correct month picker positioning (otherwise when the field is at the bottom of the browser, the offset check is off);patch3:  in onClose of _hideDatepicker: otherwise when closing the date fields will flash for a very short period which is very annoying.I know the my fix was far from good but for now it\'s working. Hope it helps.Is it just me or is this not working as it should in IE(8)?\nThe date changes when clicking done, but the datepicker opens up again, until you actually click somewhere in the page to loose focus on the input field...I\'m looking in to solving this.If you are looking for a month picker try this http://lucianocosta.info/jquery.mtz.monthpicker/This worked for me well.RevathiHappy codingWaht about:\nhttp://www.mattkruse.com/javascript/calendarpopup/Select the month-select exampleafter digging jQueryUI.com for datepicker, here\'s my conclusion and answer to your question.First, I would say no to your question. You can\'t use jQueryUI datepicker for picking month and year only. It is not supported. It has no callback function for that.But you can hack it to display only month and and year by using css to hide the days, etc. And I think won\'t make sense still cause you need the dates to be click in order to pick a date. I can say you just have to use another datepicker. Like what Roger suggested.I had the problem of date picker mixed with month picker.\nI solved it like that.If anyone want that also for multiple calendars its not very hard to add this functionallity to jquery ui.\nwith minified search for:add this in front of xsearch for and replace it with also search for replace it withfor css you should use:after that all is done just go to your desired datepicker init functions and provide setting var justMonth: true is the key here :)Made a couple of refinements to BrianS\'s nearly perfect response above:I\'ve regexed the value set on show because I think it does actually make it slightly more readable in this case (although note I\'m using a slightly different format)My client wanted no calendar so I\'ve added an on show / hide class addition to do that without affecting any other datepickers. The removal of the class is on a timer to avoid the table flashing back up as the datepicker fades out, which seems to be very noticeable in IE.EDIT: One problem left to solve with this is that there is no way to empty the datepicker - clear the field and click away and it repopulates with the selected date.EDIT2: I have not managed to solve this nicely (i.e. without adding a separate Clear button next to the input), so ended up just using this: https://github.com/thebrowser/jquery.ui.monthpicker - if anyone can get the standard UI one to do it that would be amazing.You also need this style rule:Like many others, I\'ve encountered numerous problems trying to do this, and only a combination of the solutions posted, and eventually a big hack to make it perfect, has landed me a solution.Problems with other solutions in this thread that I\'ve tried:I\'ve finally found a way to fix all of these problems. The first four can be fixed simply by being careful about how you reference your date- and monthpickers in their internal code, and of course doing some manual updating of your pickers. This you can see in the instantiation-examples near the bottom. The fifth problem can be helped by adding some custom code to the datepicker functions.NOTE: You do NOT need to use the following monthpicker scripts to fix the first three problems in your normal datepicker. Simply use the datepicker instantiation-script near the bottom of this post.Now, to use monthpickers and mend the last problem, we need to separate the datepickers and the monthpickers. We could get one of the few jQuery-UI monthpicker addons out there, but some lack localization flexibility/ability, some lack animation support...so, what to do? Roll your "own" from the datepicker-code! This gets you a fully-functioning monthpicker, with all the functionalities of the datepicker, just without the displaying of days.I have supplied a monthpicker js-script and the accompanying CSS-script, using the method described below, with the jQuery-UI v1.11.1 code. Simply copy these code-snippets to two new files, monthpicker.js and monthpicker.css, respectively.If you don\'t care about how I made these, scroll past this section, and down to the line "Now to add the datepickers and monthpickers to the page!"I\'ve taken all the javascript code from jquery-ui-1.11.1.js pertaining to their datepicker, pasted it into a new js-file, and replaced the following strings:Then I removed the part of the for-loop which creates the entire ui-datepicker-calendar div (the one other solutions hide using CSS). This can be found in the _generateHTML: function (inst).Find the line that says:Mark everything from after the closing div-tag and down to (and not including) the line where it says:Now it\'ll be unhappy, because we need to close some things. After that closing div-tag from before, add this:The code should now be seamed together nicely. Here\'s a code-snippet showing what you should\'ve ended up with:Then I copy/pasted the code from jquery-ui.css pertaining to the datepickers to a new CSS-file, and replaced the following strings:These following javascript code-snippets work with multiple datepickers and/or monthpickers on the page, without the aforementioned problems! Fixed generally by using \'$(this).\' a lot :)The first script is for a normal datepicker, and the second one is for the "new" monthpickers.The out-commented .after, which lets you create some element to clear the input-field, is stolen from Paul Richards\' answer.I\'m using the "MM yy" format in my monthpicker, and the \'yy-mm-dd\' format in my datepicker, but this is completely compatible with all formats, so you are free to use whichever one you want. Simply change the \'dateFormat\' option. The standard options \'showButtonPanel\', \'showAnim\', and \'yearRange\' are of course optional and customizable to your wishes.Datepicker instantiation.\nThis one goes from 90 years ago and to the present day. It helps you to keep the input-field correct, especially if you set the defaultDate, minDate and maxDate options, but it can handle it if you don\'t. It will work with any dateFormat you choose.Include the monthpicker.js file and the monthpicker.css file in the page you want to use the monthpickers.Monthpicker instantiation\nThe value retrieved from this monthpicker, is always the FIRST day of the selected month.\nStarts at the current month, and ranges from 100 years ago and 10 years into the future.That\'s it!\nThat\'s all you need to make a monthpicker.I can\'t seem to make a jsfiddle work with this, but it is working for me in my ASP.NET MVC project. Just do what you normally do to add a datepicker to your page, and incorporate the above scripts, possibly by changing the selector (meaning $("#MyMonthTextBox")) to something that works for you.I hope this helps someone.Monthpicker working on the last day of the month. The date you get from this monthpicker will always be the last day of the month.Two collaborating monthpickers; \'start\' is working on the first of the month, and \'end\' is working on the last of the month. They are both restricted by each other, so choosing a month on \'end\' which is before the selected month on \'start\', will change \'start\' to be the same month as \'end\'. And vice versa. OPTIONAL: When selecting a month on \'start\', the \'minDate\' is set on \'end\'. To remove this feature, comment out one line in onClose (read the comments).Two collaborating datepickers; They are both restricted by each other, so choosing a date on \'end\' which is before the selected date on \'start\', will change \'start\' to be the same month as \'end\'.

I made a simple one with year on header and 3 rows of 4 months below. Check it out: Simple monthyear picker with jQuery.I tried the various solutions provided here and they worked fine if you simply wanted a couple of drop downs.  The best (in appearance etc) \'picker\' (https://github.com/thebrowser/jquery.ui.monthpicker) suggested here is basically a copy of an old version of jquery-ui datepicker with the _generateHTML rewritten.  However, I found it no longer plays nicely with current jquery-ui (1.10.2) and had other issues (doesn\'t close on esc, doesn\'t close on other widget opening, has hardcoded styles). Rather than attempt to fix that monthpicker and rather than reattempt the same process with the latest datepicker, I went with hooking into the relevant parts of the existing date picker.   This involves overriding:As this question is a bit old and already well answered, here\'s only the _selectDay override to show how this was done:As stated, this is an old question, but I found it useful so wanted to add feedback with an alterantive solution.I\'ve had certain difficulties with the accepted answer and no other one could be used with a minimum effort as a base. So, I decided to tweak the latest version of the accepted answer until it satisfies at least minimum JS coding/reusability standards.Here is a way much cleaner solution than the 3rd (latest) edition of the Ben Koehler\'s accepted answer. Moreover, it will:Check it out:And everything else you need is the following CSS somewhere around:That\'s it. Hope the above will save some time for further readers.for a monthpicker, using JQuery v 1.7.2, I have the following javascript which is doing just that\n  $l("[id$=txtDtPicker]").monthpicker({\n                showOn: "both",\n                buttonImage: "../../images/Calendar.png",\n                buttonImageOnly: true,\n                pattern: \'yyyymm\', // Default is \'mm/yyyy\' and separator char is not mandatory\n                monthNames: [\'Jan\', \'Fev\', \'Mar\', \'Abr\', \'Mai\', \'Jun\', \'Jul\', \'Ago\', \'Set\', \'Out\', \'Nov\', \'Dez\']\n            });\nEveryone here is getting value of month , year like this,But just now I\'m facing issue while fetching values from > and <. Because It give us value of selected value in dropdown so it provides us old value not   new values.So, As per the document of Jquery UI :- http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/.\nWe can directly fetch year , month from function. For other values like day\netc. we can easily access them through inst object of jqueryUI function. We can access inst like below,So, Using onChangeMonthYear we can get current month , year and day values directly from function so no need to work out for selected value.HTML :- Script :-Note :- It can be useful when we want inline monthpicker. Just replace input field to division and we can use it inline while using inline make sure you are using onChangeMonthYear,For Inline MonthPicker :- Use onSelect call back and remove the year portion manually and set the text in the field manually
