I realize the Swift book provided an implementation of a random number generator.  Is the best practice to copy and paste this implementation in one\'s own program?  Or is there a library that does this that we can use now?Use the standard library functions for high quality random numbers: arc4random() or arc4random_uniform(), just as in Objective-C.They are in the Darwin module, so if you haven\'t imported AppKit, UIKit, or Foundation (which import it for you), you will need to import Darwin.Use arc4random_uniform(n) for a random integer between 0 and n-1 Cast the result to Int so you don\'t have to explicitly type your vars as UInt32 (which seems un-Swifty)Edit: Updated for Swift 3.0arc4random works well in Swift, but the base functions are limited to 32-bit integer types (Int is 64-bit on iPhone 5S and modern Macs). Here\'s a generic function for a random number of a type expressible by an integer literal:We can use this new generic function to extend UInt64, adding boundary arguments and mitigating modulo bias. (This is lifted straight from arc4random.c)With that we can extend Int64 for the same arguments, dealing with overflow:To complete the family...After all that, we can finally do something like this:I used this code:This method will generate a random Int value between the given minimum and maximumAs of iOS 9, you can use the new GameplayKit classes to generate random numbers in a variety of ways.You have four source types to choose from: a general random source (unnamed, down to the system to choose what it does), linear congruential, ARC4 and Mersenne Twister. These can generate random ints, floats and bools.At the simplest level, you can generate a random number from the system\'s built-in random source like this:That generates a number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. If you want a number between 0 and an upper bound (exclusive) you\'d use this:GameplayKit has some convenience constructors built in to work with dice. For example, you can roll a six-sided die like this:Plus you can shape the random distribution by using things like GKShuffledDistribution. That takes a little more explaining, but if you\'re interested you can read my tutorial on GameplayKit random numbers.You can do it the same way that you would in C:randomNumber is inferred to be of type UInt32 (a 32-bit unsigned integer)Usage:arc4random_uniform(someNumber: UInt32) -> UInt32This gives you random integers in the range 0 to someNumber - 1. The maximum value for UInt32 is 4,294,967,295 (that is, 2^32 - 1).Examples:Coin flipDice rollRandom day in OctoberRandom year in the 1990sGeneral form:where number, max, and min are UInt32.arc4random()You can also get a random number by using arc4random(), which produces a UInt32 between 0 and 2^32-1. Thus to get a random number between 0 and x-1, you can divide it by x and take the remainder. Or in other words, use the Remainder Operator (%):However, this produces the slight modulo bias (see also here and here), so that is why arc4random_uniform() is recommended.Converting to and from IntNormally it would be fine to do something like this in order to convert back and forth between Int and UInt32:The problem, though, is that Int has a range of -2,147,483,648...2,147,483,647 on 32 bit systems and a range of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808...9,223,372,036,854,775,807 on 64 bit systems. Compare this to the UInt32 range of 0...4,294,967,295. The U of UInt32 means unsigned.Consider the following errors:So you just need to be sure that your input parameters are within the UInt32 range and that you don\'t need an output that is outside of that range either.I\'ve been able to just use rand() to get a random CInt. You can make it an Int by using something like this: You can use your favourite C random function, and just convert to value to Int if needed.Example for random number in between 10 (0-9);Very easy code - simple and short.Here is a library that does the job well\nhttps://github.com/thellimist/SwiftRandom@jstn\'s answer is good, but a bit verbose. Swift is known as a protocol-oriented language, so we can achieve the same result without having to implement boilerplate code for every class in the integer family, by adding a default implementation for the protocol extension.Now we can do:and all other integer classes are ok.Here 5 will make sure that the random number is generated though zero to five. You can set the value accordingly. I would like to add to existing answers that the random number generator example in the Swift book is a Linear Congruence Generator (LCG), it is a severely limited one and shouldn\'t be except for the must trivial examples, where quality of randomness doesn\'t matter at all. And a LCG should never be used for cryptographic purposes. arc4random() is much better and can be used for most purposes, but again should not be used for cryptographic purposes.If you want something that is guaranteed to be cryptographically secure, use SecCopyRandomBytes().  Note that if you build a random number generator into something, someone else might end up (mis)-using it for cryptographic purposes (such as password, key or salt generation), then you should consider using SecCopyRandomBytes() anyway, even if your need doesn\'t quite require that.Without arc4Random_uniform() in some versions of Xcode(in 7.1 it runs but doesn\'t autocomplete for me). You can do this instead. To generate a random number from 0-5.\nFirstThenThe following code will produce a secure random number between 0 and 255:You call it like this:For bigger numbers it becomes more complicated.\nThis is the best I could come up with:These methods use an extra random number to determine how many UInt8s are going to be used to create the random number. The last line converts the [UInt8] to UInt16 or UInt32.I don\'t know if the last two still count as truly random, but you can tweak it to your likings :)You can use GeneratorOf like this:I use this code to generate a random number:
