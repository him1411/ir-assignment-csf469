I need to change the primary key of a table to an identity column, and there\'s already a number of rows in table. I\'ve got a script to clean up the IDs to ensure they\'re sequential starting at 1, works fine on my test database. What\'s the SQL command to alter the column to have an identity property?You can\'t alter the existing columns for identity.You have 2 options,Create a new table with identity & drop the existing tableCreate a new column with identity & drop the existing columnApproach 1. (New table) Here you can retain the existing data values on the newly created identity column.Approach 2 (New column) You can\xe2\x80\x99t retain the existing data values on the newly created identity column, The identity column will hold the sequence of number.See the following Microsoft SQL Server Forum post for more details:How to alter column to identity(1,1)In SQL 2005 and above, there\'s a trick to solve this problem without changing the table\'s data pages. This is important for large tables where touching every data page can take minutes or hours.  The trick also works even if the identity column is a primary key, is part of a clustered or non-clustered index, or other gotchas which can trip up the the simpler "add/remove/rename column" solution. Here\'s the trick: you can use SQL Server\'s ALTER TABLE...SWITCH statement to change the schema of a table without changing the data, meaning you can replace a table with an IDENTITY with an identical table schema, but without an IDENTITY column.  The same trick works to add IDENTITY to an existing column.Normally, ALTER TABLE...SWITCH is used to efficiently replace a full partition in a partitioned table with a new, empty partition.  But it can also be used in non-partitioned tables too.I\'ve used this trick to convert, in under 5 seconds, a column of a of a 2.5 billion row table from IDENTITY to a non-IDENTITY (in order to run a multi-hour query whose query plan worked better for non-IDENTITY columns), and then restored the IDENTITY setting, again in less than 5 seconds.Here\'s a code sample of how it works. This is obviosuly more involved than the solutions in other answers, but if your table is large this can be a real life-saver.  There are some caveats:There\'s a good article on TechNet detailing the requirements above. You cannot alter a column to be an IDENTITY column. What you\'ll need to do is create a new column which is defined as an IDENTITY from the get-go, then drop the old column, and rename the new one to the old name.MarcThere is cool solution described here:\nSQL SERVER \xe2\x80\x93 Add or Remove Identity Property on ColumnIn short edit manually your table in SQL Manager, switch the identity, DO NOT SAVE changes, just show the script which will be created for the changes, copy it and use it later.It is huge time saver, because it (the script) contains all the foreign keys, indices, etc. related to the table you change. Writting this manually... God forbid.By design there is no simple way to turn on or turn off the identity feature for an existing column.  The only clean way to do this is to create a new column and make it an identity column or create a new table and migrate your data.If we use SQL Server Management Studio to get rid of the identity value on column "id", a new temporary table is created, the data is moved to the temporary table, the old table is dropped and the new table is renamed.Use Management Studio to make the change and then right click in the designer and select "Generate Change Script".You will see that this is what SQL server in doing in the background.you can\'t do it like that, you need to add another column, drop the original column and rename the new column or or create a new table, copy the data in and drop the old table followed by renaming the new table to the old tableif you use SSMS and set the identity property to ON in the designer here is what SQL Server does behind the scenes. So if you have a table named [user] this is what happens if you make UserID and identityHaving said that there is a way to hack the system table to accomplish it by setting the bitwise value but that is not supported and I wouldn\'t do itSimple explanationRename the existing column using sp_RENAMEEXEC sp_RENAME \'Table_Name.Existing_ColumnName\' , \'New_ColumnName\', \'COLUMN\'Example for Rename :The existing column UserID is renamed as OldUserIDThen add a new column using alter query to set as primary key and identity valueExample for Set Primary keyThe new created column name is UserIDthen Drop the Renamed ColumnExample for Drop renamed columnNow we\'ve adding a primarykey and identity to the existing column on the table.There isn\'t one, sadly; the IDENTITY property belongs to the table rather than the column.The easier way is to do it in the GUI, but if this isn\'t an option, you can go the long way around of copying the data, dropping the column, re-adding it with identity, and putting the data back.See here  for a blow-by-blow account.I\'m a java developer that happened to get on a team without a DBA and one where as a developer, I can\'t get DBA rights.  I was tasked with moving an entire schema between two databases, so without having a DBA I had to do it and do it by running scripts, not being able to use the GUI in Sql Server 2008 because I didn\'t have admin priviledges.Everything was moved without issue, however, when running a stored procedure on the new schema.table, I found I lost the identity field in a table.  I double checked the script that created the table and it was there, however, Sql Server didn\'t get it when I ran the script.  I was told later by a DBA that he had seen this same problem before.In any event, for Sql Server 2008, these are the steps I took to get this resolved and they worked, so I\'m posting this here in the hopes it will be a help to someone.  This is what I did as I had FK dependencies on another table that made this more difficult:I used this query to verify the identity was indeed missing and to view dependecies on the table.1.) Find statistics on a table:2.) Create a duplicate, identical new table, except add an identity field on the PK field where it had been before.3.) Disable the identity to move data.4.) Transfer the data.5.) Verify the data is there.6.) Re-enable the identity.7.) This is the best script I found to get all the FK relationships to verify which table(s) the original table references as dependencies\nand I came across many, so it is a keeper!8.) Make sure you have all the PK and FK scripts for all the tables involved, before this next step.9.) You can right click on each key and script this using Sql Server 200810.) Drop the FK(s) from the dependency table(s) using this syntax:11.) Drop the original table:13.) These next steps rely on the scripts you created in Sql Server 2008 in step 9.--Add the PK on the new table.--Add the FK on the new table.--Add the FK\'s back to the dependency table.14.) Verify everything is correct and complete.  I used the GUI to look at the tables.15.) Rename the new table to the original tables name.Finally, everything worked!The accepted answer is wrong: you can alter a existing column to be an identity as long as it doesn\'t contain any null values. After the change the identity seed will start at the max(column) + 1.So what you really need to do first, is to supply values for all the nulls.As I understood in normal cases we are creating a table with Primary key which is having Identity property\nSo Rename or Delete a column which is associated with Primary Key constraint will not be possible because constraint Rules are validating column structure.\nTto achieve this we have to process some steps in the following way:\nLet us assume TableName = \'Employee\' and ColumnName = \'EmployeeId\'\n\n\n1.  Add new column \'EmployeeId_new\' in the \'Employee\' table \n\nALTER TABLE Employee ADD EmployeeId_new INT IDENTITY(1,1)Now remove column \'EmployeeId\' from \'Employee\' table \n\nALTER TABLE Employee DROP COLUMN EmployeeIdThis will throw error because of Primary Key Constraint rules are applicable and validating column structure.\n\n*###\n\'Msg 5074, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 The object [PK_dbo.Employee] is dependent on colmn [EmployeeId].\'###So we have to remove the Primary Key constraint first from the table \'Employee\' then we can remove the column \n\nALTER TABLE Employee DROP constraint [PK_dbo.Employee]Now we can remove the column \'EmployeeId\' from \'Employee\' table  as did in previous step where we got error\n\nALTER TABLE Employee DROP COLUMN EmployeeIdNow Column \'EmployeeId\' removed from table \nSo we will Rename the newly added new column \'EmployeeId_new\' with \'EmployeeId\'\n\nsp_rename \'Employee.EmployeeId\', \'EmployeeId_new\', \'COLUMN\'To re arrange the table in the same form as It was, we have to add Primary Key Constraint for the column \'EmployeeId\'\n\nALTER TABLE Employee add constraint [PK_dbo.Employee] primary key  (EmployeeId)8. Now the table \'Employee\' with \'EmployeeId\' is modified for Identity rules along with exiting primary key constraintIf the original poster was actually wanting to set an existing column to be a PRIMARY KEY for the table and actually did not need the column to be an IDENTITY column (two different things) then this can be done via t-SQL with:Note the parenthesis around the column name after the PRIMARY KEY option.Although this post is old and I am making an assumption about the requestors need, I felt this additional information could be helpful to users encountering this thread as I believe the conversation could lead one to believe that an existing column can not be set to be a primary key without adding it as a new column first which would be incorrect.We can add the identity for the existing column http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2009/05/03/sql-server-add-or-remove-identity-property-on-column/if it says \n"Saving changes is not permitted in SQL Server"Saving changes is not permitted in SQL ServerIN sql server 2014 (I don\'t know about lower versions) you can do this simply, using sequence.From here: Sequence as default value for a columnRight click on table name in Object Explorer. You will get some options. Click on \'Design\'. A new tab will be opened for this table. You can add Identity constraint here in \'Column Properties\'.I don\'t believe you can alter an existing column to be an identity column using tsql.  However, you can do it through the Enterprise Manager design view.Alternatively you could create a new row as the identity column, drop the old column, then rename your new column.Basically there are four logical steps.Create a new Identity column. Turn on Insert Identity for this new column.Insert the data from the source column (the column you wished to convert to Identity) to this new column.Turn off the Insert Identity for the new column.Drop your source column & rename the new column to the name of the source column.There may be some more complexities like working across multiple servers etc.Please refer the following article for the steps (using ssms & T-sql). These steps are intended for beginners with less grip on T-SQL.http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/23816.how-to-convert-int-column-to-identity-in-the-ms-sql-server.aspxgenerates a script for all tables with primary key = bigint which do not have an identity set; this will return a list of generated scripts with each table; As per my current condition, I follow this approach. I want to give identity to a primary table after data inserted via script.As I want to append identity, so it always start from 1 to End of record count that I want.
