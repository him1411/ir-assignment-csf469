This question already has an answer here:Is there a better way of getting this result? This function fails if num has more digits than digits, and I feel like it should be in the library somewhere (like Integer.toString(x,"%3d") or something)String.format (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html#syntax)In your case it will be: Since Java 1.5 you can use the String.format method. For example, to do the same thing as your example:In this case, you\'re creating the format string using the width specified in digits, then applying it directly to the number. The format for this example is converted as follows:So if digits is equal to 5, the format string becomes %05d which specifies an integer with a width of 5 printing leading zeroes. See the java docs for String.format for more information on the conversion specifiers.Another option is to use DecimalFormat to format your numeric String. Here is one other way to do the job without having to use String.format if you are stuck in the pre 1.5 world:How about just:In case of your jdk version less than 1.5, following option can be used.
