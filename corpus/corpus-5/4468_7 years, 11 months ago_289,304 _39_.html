I am using SQL Server 2008 Management Studio and have a table I want to migrate to a different db server.Is there any option to export the data as an insert into SQL script?? In SSMS in the Object Explorer, right click on the database right-click and pick "Tasks" and then "Generate Scripts".This will allow you to generate scripts for a single or all tables, and one of the options is "Script Data". If you set that to TRUE, the wizard will generate a script with INSERT INTO () statement for your data. if using 2008 R2 or 2012  it is called something else, see screenshot below this oneSelect "Types of Data to Script" which can be "Data Only", "Schema and Data" or "Schema Only" - the default). And then there\'s a "SSMS Addin" Package on Codeplex (including source) which promises pretty much the same functionality and a few more (like quick find etc.)For the sake of over-explicit brainlessness, after following marc_s\' instructions to here...In SSMS in the Object Explorer, right click on the database\n  right-click and pick "Tasks" and then "Generate Scripts".... I then see a wizard screen with "Introduction, Choose Objects, Set Scripting Options, Summary, and Save or Publish Scripts" with prev, next, finish, cancel buttons at the bottom.On the Set Scripting Options step, you have to click "Advanced" to get the page with the options.  Then, as Ghlouw has mentioned, you now select "Types of data to script" and profit.If you use it SQLServer 2008R2 you need to set Types of data to script field. If you are running SQL Server 2008 R2 the built in options on to do this in SSMS as marc_s described above changed a bit. Instead of selecting Script data = true as shown in his diagram, there is now a new option called "Types of data to script" just above the "Table/View Options" grouping. Here you can select to script data only, schema and data or schema only. Works like a charm.All the above is nice, but if you need to then the following trick is the one and only way.First learn how to create spool files or export result sets from the source db command line client.\nSecond learn how to execute sql statements on the destination db.Finally, create the insert statements (and any other statements) for the destination database by running an sql script on the source database.\ne.g.The above example was created for Oracle\'s db where the use of dual is needed for table-less selects.The result set will contain the script for the destination db.You could also check out the "Data Scripter Add-In" for SQL Server Management Studio 2008 from:http://www.mssql-vehicle-data.com/SSMSTheir features list:It was developed on SSMS 2008 and is not supported on the 2005 version at this time (soon!)Export data quickly to T-SQL for MSSQL and MySQL syntaxCSV, TXT, XML are also supported! Harness the full potential, power, and speed that SQL has to offer. Don\'t wait for Access or Excel to do scripting work for you that could take several minutes to do -- let SQL Server do it for you and take all the guess work out of exporting your data!Customize your data output for rapid backups, DDL manipulation, and more... Change table names and database schemas to your needs, quickly and efficientlyExport column names or simply generate data without the names.You can chose individual columns to script.You can chose sub-sets of data (WHERE clause).You can chose ordering of data (ORDER BY clause).Great backup utility for those grungy database debugging operations that require data manipulation. Don\'t lose data while experimenting. Manipulate data on the fly!Here is an example of creating a data migration script using a cursor to iterate the source table.
