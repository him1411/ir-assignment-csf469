Why in the following code the height of the div is bigger than the height of the img ? There is a gap below the image, but it doesn\'t seems to be a padding/margin. What is the gap or extra space below image?By default, an image is rendered inline, like a letter.It sits on the same line that a, b, c and d sit on.There is space below that line for the descenders you find on letters like f, j, p and q.You can adjust the vertical-align of the image to position it elsewhere (e.g. the middle) or change the display so it isn\'t inline.Another option suggested here is setting the style of the image as style="display: block;"To remove the gap under the image, you can:See the following code for a live demo:The gap or extra space under the image isn\'t a bug or issue, it is the default behaviour. The root cause is that images are replaced elements (see MDN and W3C). This allows them to "act like image" and have their own intrinsic dimensions, aspect ratio....\nBrowsers compute their display property to inline but they give them a special behaviour which makes them closer to inline-block elements (as you can vertical align them, give them a height, top/bottom margin and padding, transforms ...).This also means that:[...] when images are used in an inline formatting context with\n  vertical-align: baseline, the bottom of the image will be posed on the\n  container\'s baseline. (source: MDN, emphasis mine)As browsers by default compute the vertical-align property to baseline, this is the default behaviour. The following image shows where the baseline is located on text:Baseline aligned elements need to keep space for the descenders that extend below the baseline (like j, p, g ...) as you can see in the above image. In this configuration, the bottom of the image is aligned on the baseline as you can see in this example:This is why the default behaviour of the <img> tag creates a gap at the bottom of it\'s container and why changing the vertical-align property or the display property removes it as in the following demo:One can also nullify parent\'s line height:All fixes: http://jsfiddle.net/FaPFv/All you have to do is assign this property:The images by default have this property:I found it works great using display:block; on the image and vertical-align:top; on the text.or you can edit the code a JS FIDDLE You can use several methods for this issue like01.Using line height.02.Using flex 03.Using display block, table, flex and inheritI just added float:left to div and it workedI used line-height:0 and it works fine for me.
