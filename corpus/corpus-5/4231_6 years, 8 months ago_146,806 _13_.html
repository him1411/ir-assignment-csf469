This is more of a general question about the difference between text/xml and application/xml.\nI am fairly new to writing webservices (REST - Jersey). I have been producing application/xml since it is what shows up in most tutorials / code examples that I have been using to learn, but I recently found out about text/xml and was wondering what is different about it and when would you use it over application/xml?From the RFC (3023), under section 3, XML Media Types:If an XML document -- that is, the unprocessed, source XML document\n     -- is readable by casual users, text/xml is preferable to\n     application/xml.  MIME user agents (and web user agents) that do not\n     have explicit support for text/xml will treat it as text/plain, for\n     example, by displaying the XML MIME entity as plain text.\n     Application/xml is preferable when the XML MIME entity is unreadable\n     by casual users.(emphasis mine)This is an old question, but one that is frequently visited and clear recommendations are now available from RFC7303 which obsoletes RFC3023. In a nutshell (section 9.2):According to this article application/xml is preferred.EDITI did a little follow-up on the article. The author claims that the encoding declared in XML processing instructions, like:can be ignored when text/xml media type is used.They support the thesis with the definition of text/* MIME type family specification in RFC 2046, specifically the following fragment:According to them, such difficulties can be avoided when using application/xml MIME type. Whether it\'s true or not, I wouldn\'t go as far as to avoid text/xml. IMHO, it\'s best just to follow the semantics of human-readability(non-readability) and always remember to specify the charset.application/xml is seen by svn as binary type whereas text/xml as text file for which a diff can be displayed.
