Say I have a file in my git repostiory called foo.Suppose it has been deleted with rm (not git rm).  Then git status will show:How do I stage this individual file deletion?If I try:It says:Use git rm foo to stage the file for deletion. (This will also delete the file from the file system, if it hadn\'t been previously deleted. It can, of course, be restored from git, since it was previously checked in.)To stage the file for deletion without deleting it from the file system, use git rm --cached fooYou could do git add -u.This would help if you want to delete multiple files, without doing git rm for each of them.To stage all manually deleted files you can use:To add an alias to this command as git rm-deleted, run:to Add all ready deleted files thank check to make sureyou should be good to goYou can use git rm -r --cached -- "path/to/directory"to stage a deleted directory.Since Git 2.0.0, git add will also stage file deletions.Git 2.0.0 Docs - git-add< pathspec >\xe2\x80\xa6Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g. *.c) can be given to add all > matching files. Also a leading directory name (e.g. dir to add dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to update the index to match the current state of the directory as a whole (e.g. specifying dir will record not just a file dir/file1 modified in the working tree, a file dir/file2 added to the working tree, but also a file dir/file3 removed from the working tree. Note that older versions of Git used to ignore removed files; use --no-all option if you want to add modified or new files but ignore removed ones.
