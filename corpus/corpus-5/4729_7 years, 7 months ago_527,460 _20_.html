I am trying to access HTTP link using HttpURLConnection in Android to download a file, but I am getting this warning in LogCat:WARN/System.err(223): java.net.SocketException: Permission denied (maybe missing INTERNET permission) I have added android.Manifest.permission to my application but its still giving the same exception.Assuming you do not have permissions set from your LogCat error description, here is my contents for my AndroidMainfest.xml file that has access to the internet:Other than that, you should be fine to download a file from the internet. In case somebody will struggle with same issue, it is case sensitive statement, so wrong case means your application won\'t get the permission.WRONGCORRECTThis issue may happen ie. on autocomplete in IDEIf you are using the Eclipse ADT plugin for your development, open AndroidManifest.xml in the Android Manifest Editor (should be the default action for opening AndroidManifest.xml from the project files list).Afterwards, select the Permissions tab along the bottom of the editor (Manifest - Application - Permissions - Instrumentation - AndroidManifest.xml), then click Add... a Uses Permission and select the desired permission from the dropdown on the right, or just copy paste in the necessary one (such as the android.permission.INTERNET permission you required).Copy the following line to your application manifest file and paste before the <application>  tag. Placing the permission below the <application/> tag will work, but will give you warning. So take care to place it before the <application/> tag declaration.When using eclipse, Follow these steps1) Double click on the manifest to show it on the editor\n2) Click on the permissions tab below the manifest editor\n3) Click on Add button\n4) on the dialog that appears Click uses permission. (Ussually the last item on the list)\n5) Notice the view that appears on the rigth side Select "android.permission.INTERNET"\n6) Then a series of Ok and finally save.\n\nHope this helpsJust add this to your android manifest:That may be also interesting in context of adding INTERNET permission to your application:Google has also given each app Internet access, effectively removing the Internet access permission. Oh, sure, Android developers still have to declare they want Internet access when putting together the app. But users can no longer see the Internet access permission when installing an app and current apps that don\xe2\x80\x99t have Internet access can now gain Internet access with an automatic update without prompting you.Source: http://www.howtogeek.com/190863/androids-app-permissions-were-just-simplified-now-theyre-much-less-secure/Bottom line is that you still have to add INTERNET permission in manifest file but application will be updated on user\'s devices without asking them for new permission.
