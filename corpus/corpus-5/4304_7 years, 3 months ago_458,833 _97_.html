I have installed PostgreSQL and pgAdminIII on my Ubuntu Karmic box.I am able to use pgAdminIII successfully (i.e. connect/log on), however when I try to login to the server using the same username/pwd on the command line (using psql), I get the error:Does anyone now how to resolve this issue?Did you set the proper settings in pg_hba.conf?See https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/serverguide/postgresql.html how to do it.The following steps work for a fresh install of postgres 9.1 on Ubuntu 12.04. (Worked for postgres 9.3.9 on Ubuntu 14.04 too.)By default, postgres creates a user named \'postgres\'. We log in as her, and give her a password.Logout of psql by typing \\q or ctrl+d. Then we connect as \'postgres\'. The -h localhost part is important: it tells the psql client that we wish to connect using a TCP connection (which is configured to use password authentication), and not by a PEER connection (which does not care about the password).Edit the file /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf and replace ident or peer by either md5 or trust, depending on whether you want it to ask for a password on your own computer or not.\nThen reload the configuration file with:You\'re getting this error because you\'re failing client authentication. Based on the error message, you probably have the default postgres configuration, which sets client authentication method to "IDENT" for all PostgreSQL connections.You should definitely read section 19.1 Client Authentication in the PostgreSQL manual to better understand the authentication settings available (for each record in pg_hba.conf), but here is the relevant snippet to help with the problem you\'re having (from the version 9.5 manual):trustAllow the connection unconditionally. This method allows anyone that\n  can connect to the PostgreSQL database server to login as any\n  PostgreSQL user they wish, without the need for a password or any\n  other authentication. See Section 19.3.1 for details.rejectReject the connection unconditionally. This is useful for "filtering\n  out" certain hosts from a group, for example a reject line could block\n  a specific host from connecting, while a later line allows the\n  remaining hosts in a specific network to connect.md5Require the client to supply a double-MD5-hashed password for\n  authentication. See Section 19.3.2 for details.passwordRequire the client to supply an unencrypted password for\n  authentication. Since the password is sent in clear text over the\n  network, this should not be used on untrusted networks. See Section\n  19.3.2 for details.gssUse GSSAPI to authenticate the user. This is only available for TCP/IP\n  connections. See Section 19.3.3 for details.sspiUse SSPI to authenticate the user. This is only available on Windows.\n  See Section 19.3.4 for details.identObtain the operating system user name of the client by contacting the\n  ident server on the client and check if it matches the requested\n  database user name. Ident authentication can only be used on TCP/IP\n  connections. When specified for local connections, peer authentication\n  will be used instead. See Section 19.3.5 for details.peerObtain the client\'s operating system user name from the operating\n  system and check if it matches the requested database user name. This\n  is only available for local connections. See Section 19.3.6 for\n  details.ldapAuthenticate using an LDAP server. See Section 19.3.7 for details.radiusAuthenticate using a RADIUS server. See Section 19.3.8 for details.certAuthenticate using SSL client certificates. See Section 19.3.9 for\n  details.pamAuthenticate using the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) service\n  provided by the operating system. See Section 19.3.10 for details.So ... to solve the problem you\'re experiencing, you could do one of the following:Change the authentication method(s) defined in your pg_hba.conf\nfile to trust, md5, or password (depending on your security\nand simplicity needs) for the local connection records you have\ndefined in there.Update pg_ident.conf to map your operating system users to\nPostgreSQL users and grant them the corresponding access privileges,\ndepending on your needs.Leave the IDENT settings alone and create users in your database for\neach operating system user that you want to grant access to. If a\nuser is already authenticated by the OS and logged in, PostgreSQL\nwon\'t require further authentication and will grant access to that\nuser based on whatever privileges (roles) are assigned to it in the\ndatabase. This is the default configuration.Note: The location of pg_hba.conf and pg_ident.conf is OS dependent.Simply adding the -h localhost bit was all mine required to workYou can set the environment variable PGHOST=localhost:In case none of the above works for you:\n\n\nI\'ve done quite a few Postgres installations, but was flummoxed today on a RedHat 6.5 system (installing Postgres 9.3).  My typical hba.conf configuration that Aron shows above didn\'t work.  It turned out that my system was using IPV6, and ignoring the IPV4 configuration.  Adding the line:allowed me to login successfully.I found that I had to install an identity server, that listens on port 113.And then ident worked.The problem is still your pg_hba.conf file. This line: You can found this file in /etc/postgres/varion/mainThese are brief descriptions of both options according to the official PostgreSQL docs on authentication methods.Peer authenticationThe peer authentication method works by obtaining the client\'s operating system user name from the kernel and using it as the allowed database user name (with optional user name mapping). This method is only supported on local connections.Password authenticationThe password-based authentication methods are md5 and password. These methods operate similarly except for the way that the password is sent across the connection, namely MD5-hashed and clear-text respectively.If you are at all concerned about password "sniffing" attacks then md5 is preferred. Plain password should always be avoided if possible. However, md5 cannot be used with the db_user_namespace feature. If the connection is protected by SSL encryption then password can be used safely (though SSL certificate authentication might be a better choice if one is depending on using SSL).After altering this file, don\'t forget to restart your PostgreSQL server. If you\'re on Linux, that would be sudo service postgresql restart.my solution on PostgreSQL 9.3 on Mac OSX in bash shell was to use sudo to go into the data folder, and then append the necessary lines to the pg_hba.conf file to allow for all users to be trusted and be able to log in.  This is what I did:Out of all the answers above nothing worked for me. I had to manually change the users password in the database and it suddenly worked.I used the following settings:Connection is successful finally for the following command:If you can connect with the username and password in pgAdminIII but you can\'t connect with psql then those two programs are probably connecting to the  database differently.[If you\'re connecting to different databases, first try connecting to the same database. See below.]From PostgreSQL: Documentation: 9.3: psql:If you omit the host name, psql will connect via a Unix-domain socket to a server on the local host, or via TCP/IP to localhost on machines that don\'t have Unix-domain sockets.If you\'re not running something like psql ... -h host_name ..., and you\'re running Ubuntu, psql should be connecting via a Unix-domain socket, so PostgreSQL probably isn\'t configured to allow one of the password authentication methods for the postgres user.You can test this by running:sudo -u postgres psqlIf the above works, your server is probably configured to use peer authentication for local connections by the postgres user, i.e. asking the OS for your user name to confirm that you\'re postgres.The full path of the file will be something like /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf. You can view it by, e.g. sudo cat /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf | more.If you\'re omitting the host name in your psql command, you should be able to connect if you add the following entry to your pg_hba.conf file:[Commented lines in the pg_hba.conf file start with #.]If you are including the host name in your psql command, add this entry instead:You need to put the entry before any other entries are matched for your connection via psql. If in doubt about where to put it, just put it before the first un-commented line. From PostgreSQL: Documentation: 9.3: The pg_hba.conf File [bold emphasis mine]:The first record with a matching connection type, client address, requested database, and user name is used to perform authentication. There is no "fall-through" or "backup": if one record is chosen and the authentication fails, subsequent records are not considered. If no record matches, access is denied.Note that records are not matched on authentication method. So, if your pg_hba.conf file contains the following entry:Then you won\'t be able to connect via:psql -u postgresUnless one of these entries is in your pg_hba.conf file above the former entry:If you\'ve done all this and it still doesn\'t work, check the expiry for that user:Postgres password authentication failsI\'ve spent more time solving this error that I care to admit.The order of authentication configuration in pg_hba.conf is relevant in your case I think. The default configuration file includes several lines in a vanilla install. These defaults can match the conditions of your authentication attempts resulting in a failure to authenticate. It fails regardless of additional configuration added at the end of the .conf file.To check which line of configuration is use make sure to look at the default log file for messages. You might see something like thisIt turns out this default line is causing the rejection.try commenting it out.One hack around this is to edit pg_hba.confTo temporarily At this point you are done. For security, then go and then go back and set pg_hba.conf back to I had similar problem and I fixed it in pg_hba.conf when removing all ident methods even for IP6 address (in spite I have only IP4 on machine).I had the same issuse after following this: PostgreSQL setup for Rails development in Ubuntu 12.04 I tried the other answers but all I had to do was in: "config/database.yml" If you are using it on CentOS,you may need to reload postgres after making the above solutions:In my case, solution here: (for people who concerned)\nlogin to postgres:regardsThis worked for me :\nhttp://tecadmin.net/fatal-ident-authentication-failed-for-user-postgres/#local   all             postgres                                trust\nlocal   all             myapp_usr                               trusthost    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
