I have a bunch of files in a changeset, but I want to specifically ignore a single modified file. Looks like this after git status:Is there a way I can do git add but just ignore the one text file I don\'t want to touch? Something like:1) To start ignoring changes to a single already versioned fileand to undo that git update-index --no-assume-unchanged "main/dontcheckmein.txt"check here2) To completely ignore a specific single file preventing it from being created at repositoryFirst look at this Git global ignore not working and at .gitignore add the relative path to the file without leading ./ so if your file is at MyProject/MyFolder/myfile.txt (where .git is also at MyProject), at .gitignore you put just this MyFolder/myfile.txtyou can confirm what rule is related to the ignore with git check-ignore "MyFolder/myfile.txt"About global ignoreThat link speaks about ~/.gitignore_global; but the file is related to your project; so, if you put the exclude pattern MyFolder/myfile.txt at ~/.gitignore_global, it will work but will not make much sense...  In the other hand, if you setup your project with git config core.excludesfile .gitignore where .gitignore is at MyProject; that setup will override ~/.gitignore_global that can have very useful rules...So, for now, I think the best is to make some script to mix your .gitignore with ~/.gitignore_global at .gitignore.One last warning\nIf the file you want to ignore is already on the repository, this method will not work unless you do this: git rm "MyFolder/myfile.txt", but backup it first as it will be removed locally also! you can copy it back later...For a FileFor a folderWhile Ben Jackson is correct, I thought I would add how I\'ve been using that solution as well. Below is a very simple script I use (that I call gitadd) to add all changes except a select few that I keep listed in a file called .gittrackignore (very similar to how .gitignore works).And this is what my current .gittrackignore looks like.I\'m working on an Android project that I compile from the command line when deploying. This project depends on SherlockActionBar, so it needs to be referenced in project.properties, but that messes with the compilation, so now I just type gitadd and add all of the changes to git without having to un-add project.properties every single time.Try this:git checkout -- main/dontcheckmein.txtYou have a nice example on Git\'s page (first example):\nhttp://git-scm.com/docs/git-resetI use git add --patch quite a bit and wanted something like this to avoid having to hit d all the time through the same files. I whipped up a very hacky couple of git aliases to get the job done:In my case I just wanted to ignore certain minified files all the time, but you could make it use an environment variable like $GIT_EXCLUDE_PATTERN for a more general use case.
