In C#, I can use the throw; statement to rethrow an exception while preserving the stack trace:Is there something like this in Java (that doesn\'t lose the original stack trace)?will simply rethrow the exception you\'ve caught (obviously the surrounding method has to permit this via its signature etc.). The exception will maintain the original stack trace.I would prefer:You can also wrap the exception in another one AND keep the original stack trace by passing in the Exception as a Throwable as the cause parameter:In Java is almost the same:In Java, you just throw the exception you caught, so throw e rather than just throw. Java maintains the stack trace.something like thisThis is a concrete example where the method throws an IOException. The final means t can only hold an exception thrown from the try block.
