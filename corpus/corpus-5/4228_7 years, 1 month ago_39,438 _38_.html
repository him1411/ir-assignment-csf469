I often put work away for later, then other stuff comes along, and a few weeks later, I want to inspect the stash, and find out what changes it would make if I applied it to working tree in its current state.I know I can do a git diff on the stash, but this shows me all the differences between the working tree and the stash, whereas I\'m just interested to know what the stash apply is going to change.How can I do this?git stash show will show you the files that changed in your most recent stash.  You can add the -p option to show the diff.If the stash you are interested in is not the most recent one, then add the name of the stash to the end of the command:To view a current list of stash, useYou should be able to see a list, such asTo view diff on any of those stashes, use the command git stash show -p stash@{n}I\'m a fan of gitk\'s graphical UI to visualize git repos. You can view the last item stashed with:You can also use view any of your stashed changes (as listed by git stash list).  For example:In the below screenshot, you can see the stash as a commit in the upper-left, when and where it came from in commit history, the list of files modified on the bottom right, and the line-by-line diff in the lower-left.  All while the stash is still tucked away.By simply applying the stash using git stash apply?  This doesn\'t remove the stash, so you can reset you working tree without losing the stashed work, if you don\'t like the changes.  And if you like them, you can simply remove the stash with git stash drop.To view all the changes in an un-popped stash:git stash show -p stash@{0}To view the changes of one particular file in an un-popped stash:git diff HEAD stash@{0} -- path/to/filename.phpBeyond the gitk recommendation in Is it possible to preview stash contents in git? you can install tig and call tig stash. This free/open console program also allows you to choose which stash to compareI use this to see all my stashes with colour diff highlighting (on Fedora 21):(Adapted from Git: see what's in a stash without applying stash)You can view all stashes\' list by the following command: git stash liststash@{0}: WIP on dev: ddd4d75 spelling fixstash@{1}: WIP on dev: 40e65a8 setting width for messages..................stash@{12}: WIP on dev: 264fdab added token based authNewest stash is the first one.You can simply select index n of stash provided in the above list and use the following command to view stashed detailsgit stash show -p stash@{3}Similarly,git stash show -p stash@{n}You can also check diff by using the command : git diff HEAD stash@{n} -- /path/to/fileFirst we can make use of git stash list to get all stash items:Then we can make use of git stash show stash@{N} to check the files under a specific stash N. If we fire it then we may get:The reason for this may be that the shell is eating up curly braces and git sees stash@2 and not stash@{2}. And to fix this we need to make use of single quotes for braces as:
