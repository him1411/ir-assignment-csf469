Say I have a repository on git.fedorahosted.org and I want to clone this into my account at github to have my own playground aside from the more "official" repo on fedorahosted.\nWhat would be the steps to initially copy that over?\nWithin github there is this nice "fork" button, but I can\'t use this for obvious reasons.And how would I track changes in the fedorahosted repo into the github one? Now you can work with it just like any other github repo. To pull in patches from upstream, simply run git pull upstream master && git push origin master.There is a deleted answer on this question that had a useful link:  https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repositoryThe gist isOP\'s example:On your local machineTo push your existing repo into different, you need to:Clone the original repo first.Push the cloned sources to your new repository:You may change master:master into source:destination branch.If you want to push specific commit (branch), then do:On the original repo, create and checkout a new branch:Choose and reset to the point which you want to start with:Alternatively select the commit by git cherry-pick to append into existing HEAD.Then push to your new repo:If you\'re rebasing, use -f for force push (not recommended). Run git reflog to see history of changes.Do you really want to simply push your local repository (with its local branches, etc.) to the new remote or do you really want to mirror the old remote (with all its branches, tags, etc) on the new remote?  If the latter here\'s a great blog on How to properly mirror a git repository.I strongly encourage you to read the blog for some very important details, but the short version is this:In a new directory run these commands:Try this https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/01/totw-copying-a-full-git-repo/Create a local repository in the temp-dir directory using:git clone  temp-dirGo into the temp-dir directory.To see a list of the different branches in ORI do:Checkout all the branches that you want to copy from ORI to NEW using:Now fetch all the tags from ORI using:Before doing the next step make sure to check your local tags and branches using the following commands:Now clear the link to the ORI repository with the following command:Now link your local repository to your newly created NEW repository using the following command:Now push all your branches and tags with these commands:You now have a full copy from your ORI repo.I have had the same problem.In my case, since I have the original repository in my local machine, I have made a copy in a new folder without any hidden file (.git, .gitignore).Finally I have added the .gitignore file to the new created folder.Then I have created and added the new repository from the local path (in my case using GitHub Desktop).
