Essentially I want to have a script execute when the contents of a DIV change. Since the scripts are separate (content script in chrome extension & webpage script), I need a way simply observe changes in DOM state. I could set up polling but that seems sloppy.The old contents of this answer is now deprecated.\nSee the other answers based on MutationObserver.Several years later, there is now officially a better solution.  DOM4 Mutation Observers are the replacement for deprecated DOM3 mutation events.  They are currently implemented in modern browsers as MutationObserver (or as the vendor-prefixed WebKitMutationObserver in old versions of Chrome):This example listens for DOM changes on document and its entire subtree, and it will fire on changes to element attributes as well as structural changes.  The draft spec has a full list of valid mutation listener properties:childListattributescharacterDatasubtreeattributeOldValuecharacterDataOldValueattributeFilter(This list is current as of April 2014; you may check the specification for any changes.)Another approach depending on how you are changing the div.\nIf you are using JQuery to change a div\'s contents with its html() method, you can extend that method and call a registration function each time you put html into a div.We just intercept the calls to html(), call a registration function with this, which in the context refers to the target element getting new content, then we pass on the call to the original jquery.html() function. Remember to return the results of the original html() method, because JQuery expects it for method chaining.For more info on method overriding and extension, check out http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2009-Using-Self-Executing-Function-Arguments-To-Override-Core-jQuery-Methods.htm, which is where I cribbed the closure function. Also check out the plugins tutorial at JQuery\'s site.Many sites use AJAX to add/show/change content dynamically. Sometimes it\'s used instead of in-site navigation, so current URL is changed programmatically and content scripts aren\'t automatically executed by browser in this case since the page isn\'t fetched from remote server entirely.MutationObserver (docs) to literally detect DOM changes:Event listener for sites that signal content change by sending a DOM event:Periodic checking of DOM via setInterval:\nObviously this will work only in cases when you wait for a specific element identified by its id/selector to appear, and it won\'t let you universally detect new dynamically added content unless you invent some kind of fingerprinting the existing contents.Cloaking History API inside an injected DOM script:Listening to hashchange, popstate events:There are advanced API to work with navigation: webNavigation, webRequest, but we\'ll use simple chrome.tabs.onUpdated event listener that sends a message to the content script:manifest.json:\ndeclare background/event page\ndeclare content script\nadd "tabs" permission.background.jscontent.jsIn addition to the "raw" tools provided by MutationObserver API, there exist "convenience" libraries to work with DOM mutations.Consider: MutationObserver represents each DOM change in terms of subtrees. So if you\'re, for instance, waiting for a certain element to be inserted, it may be deep inside the children of mutations.mutation[i].addedNodes[j].Another problem is when your own code, in reaction to mutations, changes DOM - you often want to filter it out.A good convenience library that solves such problems is mutation-summary (disclaimer: I\'m not the author, just a satisfied user), which enables you to specify queries of what you\'re interested in, and get exactly that.Basic usage example from the docs:
