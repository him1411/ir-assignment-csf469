In the Music app of the new iOS, we can see an album cover behind a view that blurs it. How can something like that be accomplished? I\'ve read the documentation, but did not find anything there.For iOS 8+, you can use UIVisualEffectView to achieve this effect. This is a native API that has been fine tuned for performance and great battery life, and it\'s easy to implement. Swift 3:Objective-C:Since that image in the screenshot is static, you could use CIGaussianBlur from Core Image (requires iOS 6). Here is sample: https://github.com/evanwdavis/Fun-with-Masks/blob/master/Fun%20with%20Masks/EWDBlurExampleVC.m Mind you, this is slower than the other options on this page.In the session \xe2\x80\x9cImplementing Engaging UI on iOS\xe2\x80\x9d from WWDC 2013 Apple explains how to create a blurred background (at 14:30), and mentions a method applyLightEffect implemented in the sample code using Accelerate.framework. GPUImage uses OpenGL shaders to create dynamic blurs. It has several types of blur: GPUImageBoxBlurFilter, GPUImageFastBlurFilter, GaussianSelectiveBlur, GPUImageGaussianBlurFilter. There is even a GPUImageiOSBlurFilter that \xe2\x80\x9cshould fully replicate the blur effect provided by iOS 7\'s control panel\xe2\x80\x9d (tweet, article). The article is detailed and informative.From indieambitions.com: Perform a blur using vImage. The algorithm is also used in iOS-RealTimeBlur.From Nick Lockwood: https://github.com/nicklockwood/FXBlurView The example shows the blur over a scroll view. It blurs with dispatch_async, then syncs to call updates with UITrackingRunLoopMode so the blur is not lagged when UIKit gives more priority to the scroll of the UIScrollView. This is explained in Nick\'s book iOS Core Animation, which btw it\'s great.iOS-blur This takes the blurring layer of the UIToolbar and puts it elsewhere. Apple will reject your app if you use this method. See https://github.com/mochidev/MDBlurView/issues/4From Evadne blog: LiveFrost: Fast, Synchronous UIView Snapshot Convolving. Great code and a great read. Some ideas from this post: Andy Matuschak said on Twitter: \xe2\x80\x9cyou know, a lot of the places where it looks like we\'re doing it in real time, it\'s static with clever tricks.\xe2\x80\x9d At doubleencore.com they say \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve found that a 10 pt blur radius plus a 10 pt increase in saturation best mimics iOS 7\xe2\x80\x99s blur effect under most circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d. A peek at the private headers of Apple\'s SBFProceduralWallpaperView.Finally, this isn\'t a real blur, but remember you can set rasterizationScale to get a pixelated image: http://www.dimzzy.com/blog/2010/11/blur-effect-for-uiview/I don\'t think I\'m allowed to post the code, but the above post mentioning the WWDC sample code is correct.  Here is the link: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=WWDC%202013The file you\'re looking for is the category on UIImage, and the method is applyLightEffect.As I noted above in a comment, the Apple Blur has saturation and other things going on besides blur.  A simple blur will not do... if you are looking to emulate their style.I decided to post a written Objective-C version from the accepted answer just to provide more options in this question.. The constraints could be removed if you want incase if you only support portrait mode or I just add a flag to this function to use them or not..I think the easiest solution to this is to override UIToolbar, which blurs everything behind it in iOS 7. It\'s quite sneaky, but it\'s very simple for you to implement, and fast!You can do it with any view, just make it a subclass of UIToolbar instead of UIView. You can even do it with a UIViewController\'s view property, for example...1) create a new class that is a "Subclass of" UIViewController and check the box for "With XIB for user interface".2) Select the View and go to the identity inspector in the right-hand panel (alt-command-3). Change the "Class" to UIToolbar. Now go to the attributes inspector (alt-command-4) and change the "Background" color to "Clear Color".3) Add a subview to the main view and hook it up to an IBOutlet in your interface. Call it backgroundColorView. It will look something like this, as a private category in the implementation (.m) file.4) Go to the view controller implementation (.m) file and change the -viewDidLoad method, to look as follows:This will give you a dark gray view, which blurs everything behind it. No funny business, no slow core image blurring, using everything that is at your fingertips provided by the OS/SDK.You can add this view controller\'s view to another view, as follows:Let me know if anything is unclear, I\'ll be happy to help!UIToolbar has been changed in 7.0.3 to give possibly-undesirable effect when using a coloured blur.We used to be able to set the colour using barTintColor, but if you were doing this before, you will need to set the alpha component to less than 1. Otherwise your UIToolbar will be completely opaque colour - with no blur.This can be achieved as follows: (bearing in mind self is a subclass of UIToolbar)This will give a blue-ish tint to the blurred view.Here\'s a fast implementation in Swift using CIGaussianBlur:Accepted answer is correct but there\'s an important step missing here, in case this view - for which you want blurred background - is presented using[self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil]By default, this will negate the blur as UIKit removes the presenter\'s view, which you are actually blurring. To avoid that removal, add this line before the previous onevc.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationOverFullScreen;Or use other Over styles.Found this by accident, gives me really great (near duplicate with Apple\'s) results and uses the Acceleration framework. -- http://pastebin.com/6cs6hsyQ\n*Not written by meOBJECTIVE-C    SWIFT 3.0from : https://stackoverflow.com/a/24083728/4020910Apple has provided an extension for the UIImage class called UIImage+ImageEffects.h. In  this class you have the desired methods for blurring your viewFor people who wants more control, you could make use of Apple\'s UIImageEffects sample code. You can copy the code for UIImageEffects from Apple\'s Developer Library : Blurring and Tinting an ImageHere is the Swift 2.0 code for the solution that has been provided in accepted answer:Simple answer is Add a subview and change it\'s alpha.
