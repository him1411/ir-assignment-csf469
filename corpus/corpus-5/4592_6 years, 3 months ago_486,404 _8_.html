This question already has an answer here:How can I declare utf-8 strings in source code?In source header you can declare:It is described in the PEP 0263: Then you can use UTF-8 in strings:This declaration is not needed in Python 3 as UTF-8 is the default source encoding (see PEP 3120).Additionally to above header in source code:Do not forget to verify if your text editor encodes properly your code in utf-8.\nOtherwise, you may have invisible characters that are not interpreted as utf-8.
