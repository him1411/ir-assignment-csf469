Looking for way how to configure port in Spring boot app:That is all sources :)As said in docs http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-change-the-http-porteither set server.port as system property using command line option to jvm --server.port=8090 or add application.properties in /src/main/resources/ withFor random port useThere are two main ways to change the port in the Embedded Tomcat in a Spring Boot Application.Modify application.propertiesFirst you can try the application.properties file in the /resources folder:Modify a VM optionThe second way, if you want to avoid modifying any files and checking in something that you only need on your local, you can use a vm arg:Go to Run -> Edit Configurations -> VM optionsAdditionally, if you need more information you can view the following blog post here:  Changing the port on a Spring Boot Applicationalso, you can configure port programmaticallyYou can set port in java code:Or in application.yml:Or in application.properties:Or as a command line parameter:In case you are using application.yml add the Following lines to itand of course 0 for random port. As explained in Spring documentation, there are several ways to do that:Either you set the port in the command line (for example 8888)-Dserver.port=8888 or --server.port=8888\n-Dport=8888 or --port=8888Example : java -jar -Dport=8888 test.jarOr you set the port in the application.propertiesor (in application.yml with yaml syntax)If the port passed by -Dport (or -Dserver.port) is set in command line then this port will be taken into account. If not, then the port will be 4588 by default.If you want to enforce the port in properties file whatever the environment variable, you just have to write:Since Spring Boot provides various configuration externalization mechanism (through various PropertySource implementations and/or processors wired into Environment object in order), you can set any property outside of your jar archive through following methods:Pass property through command line argumentFrom propety in SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON (Spring Boot 1.3.0+)Define environment variable in U*IX shell:By using Java system property:Pass through command line argument:Define system propertyDefine OS environment variableU*IX ShellWindowsPlace property in ./config/application.propertiesand run:Place property in ./config/application.yamland run:Place property in ./application.propertiesand run:Place property in ./application.yamland run:You can combine above methods all together, and the former configuration in the list take precedence over the latter one.For example:The server will start and listen on port 7788.This is very useful providing default properties in PropertySources with lower precedence (and usually packaged in the archive or coded in the source), and then override it in the runtime environment. And it is the design philosophy of Spring Boot:Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.SERVER_NAME to sever.name conversion was done by Realxed Binding.If you would like to do it at running it locally than use this -mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.jvmArguments=\'-Dserver.port=8085\'You can specify port by overriding EmbeddedServletContainerFactory bean within your configuration (java based or xml). There you can specify port for used embedded servlet container. Please, see Spring Boot - Core "Embedded Servlet Container Support" paragraph and example there. Hope this helps.When you need a programatically way of doing it, you can set it during startup:This might help  for things like environment dependent port. \nHave a nice dayIn application.properties file present in resources: As everyone said, you can specify in application.properties \nserver.port = 9000 (could be any other value)If you are using spring actuator in your project, by default it points to\n8080, and if you want to change it, then in application.properties mention \nmanagement.port = 9001 (could be any other value)To extend other answers:There is a section in the docs for testing which explains how to configure the port on integration tests:At integration tests, the port configuration is made using the annotation @SpringBootTest and the webEnvironment values.You can inject the value using @LocalServerPort which is the same as @Value("${local.server.port}").Random port test configuration:It takes the value from server.port if is defined.Example:Defined port test configuration:Indeed, the easiest way is to set the server.port property.If you are using STS as IDE, from version 3.6.7 you actually have Spring Properties Editor for opening the properties file.This editor provides autocomplete for all Spring Boot properties. If you write port and hit CTRL + SPACE, server.port will be the first option.You can configure port in application.properties file\nserver.port=8090OR during runtime you can use command line arg\n-Dserver.port=80901.1 Update via a properties file./src/main/resources/application.propertiesserver.port=8888Update via a yaml file.EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizerInclude below property in application.propertiesserver.port=8080You can add the port in below methods.Run -> Configurations sectionIn application.xml add server.port=XXXXYou can set that in application.properties under /src/main/resources/Add this in your application.properties fileserver.port 8080Just have a application.properties in src/main/resources of the project and give there where **** refers to the port number.You can also use SERVER_PORT environment variable to configure Spring Boot port. Just set the environment variable and restart the app:Please note that if you do not set those environment variables system wide, you should run the boot app on the same session.The default port is : 8080 but we can customize the port number in application.properties\nas shown belowMostly springboot runs on port:8080 because of embedded Tomcat. In some it may throw an error port 8080 already in use. To avoid this kind of issues we can config the server port.add server.port=9898run your application with below arguments.spring-boot:run -Drun.jvmArguments=\'-Dserver.port=8081\'Using property server.port=8080 for instance like mentioned in other answers is definitely a way to go. Just wanted to mention that you could also expose an environment property:SERVER_PORT=8080Since spring boot is able to replace "." for "_" and lower to UPPER case for environment variables in recent versions.\nThis is specially useful in containers where all you gotta do is define that environment variable without adding/editing application.properties or passing system properties through command line (i.e -Dserver.port=$PORT)You can configure your port in application.properties file in the resources folder of your spring boot project.\nserver.port="port which you need"There are three ways to do it1 Set server.port property in application.properties fileserver.port = 80902 Set server port property in application.ymlserver:\n     port: 80903 Set the property as system property in main methodSystem.setProperty("server.port","8090");In my case adding statementoverride the default tomcat server port."server.port=8080" will only works if your running application as a jar through main method,This configuration will not work if your running this application as a war file through tomcat container.If you are going to run apps as jar file in command environment, just type "SERVER_PORT=*** " as prefix. The full command to execute will look like below:If you wanna run app in background in Linux, command with \'nohup\' will look like below:
