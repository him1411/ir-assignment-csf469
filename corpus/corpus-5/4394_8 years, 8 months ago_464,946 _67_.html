How do I print the indicated div (without manually disabling all other content on the page)?I want to avoid a new preview dialog, so creating a new window with this content is not useful.The page contains a couple of tables, one of them contains the div I want to print - the table is styled with visual styles for the web, that should not show in print.Here is a general solution, using CSS only, which I have verified to work.Alternative approaches aren\'t so good. Using display is tricky because if any element has display:none then none of its descendants will display either. To use it, you have to change the structure of your page.Using visibility works better since you can turn on visibility for descendants. The invisible elements still affect the layout though, so I move section-to-print to the top left so it prints properly.I have a better solution with minimal code.Place your printable part inside a div with an id like this:Then add an event like an onclick (as shown above), and pass the id of the div like I did above.Now let\'s create a really simple javascript:Notice how simple this is?  No popups, no new windows, no crazy styling, no JS libraries like jquery.  The problem with really complicated solutions (the answer isn\'t complicated and not what I\'m referring to) is the fact that it will NEVER translate across all browsers, ever!  If you want to make the styles different, do as shown in the checked answer by adding the media attribute to a stylesheet link (media="print").  No fluff, lightweight, it just works.All the answers so far are pretty flawed - they either involve adding class="noprint" to everything or will mess up display within #printable.I think the best solution would be to create a wrapper around the non-printable stuff:Of course this is not perfect as it involves moving things around in your HTML a bit...With jQuery it\'s as simple as this:Could you use a print stylesheet, and use CSS to arrange the content you wanted printed? Read this article for more pointers.This works well:Note that this only works with "visibility". "display" won\'t do it. Tested in FF3.I didn\'t really like any of these answers as a whole.  If you have a class (say printableArea) and have that as an immediate child of body, then you can do something like this:Using the visibility can cause a lot of spacing issues and blank pages.  This is because the visibility maintains the elements space, just makes it hidden, where as display removes it and allows other elements to take up its space. The reason why this solution works is that you are not grabbing all elements, just the immediate children of body and hiding them.  The other solutions below with display css, hide all the elements, which effects everything inside of printableArea content.I wouldn\'t suggest javascript as you would need to have a print button that the user clicks and the standard browser print buttons wouldn\'t have the same effect.  If you really need to do that, what I would do is store the html of body, remove all unwanted elements, print, then add the html back.  As mentioned though, I would avoid this if you can and use a CSS option like above.Give whatever element you want to print the id printMe.Include this script in your head tag:Call the functionhm ... use the type of a stylsheet for printing ... eg:print.css:Step 1: Write the following javascript inside your head tagStep 2: Call the PrintMe(\'DivID\') function by an onclick event.With CSS 3 you could use the following:I picked up the content using JavaScript and created a window that I could print in stead...Sandro\'s method works great.I tweaked it to allow for allowing multiple printMe links, particularily to be used in tabbed pages and expanding text.function processPrint(printMe){  <-- calling for a variable herevar printReadyElem = document.getElementById(printMe);  <-- removed the quotes around printMe to ask for a variable<a href="javascript:void(processPrint(\'divID\'));">Print</a> <-- passing the div ID to be printed on to the function to turn the printMe variable into the div ID. single quotes are neededprintDiv(divId):  A generalized solution to print any div on any page.I had a similar issue but I wanted (a) to be able to print the whole page, or (b) print any one of several specific areas.  My solution, thanks to much of the above, allows you to specify any div object to be printed.  The key for this solution is to add an appropriate rule to the the print media style sheet so that the requested div (and its contents) will be printed.First, create the needed print css to suppress everything (but without the specific rule to allow the element you want to print).  Note that I have added new class rules: Then insert three JavaScript functions.  The first merely toggles the print media style sheet on and off. The second does the real work and the third cleans up afterward.  The second (printDiv) activates the print media style sheet, then appends a new rule to allow the desired div to print, issues the print, and then adds a delay before the final housekeeping (otherwise the styles can be reset before the print is actually done.)  The final functions deletes the added rule and sets the print style again to disabled so the whole page can be printed. The only other thing to do is to add one line to your onload processing so that the print style is initially disabled thereby allowing whole page printing. Then, from anywhere in your document, you can print a div. Just issue printDiv("thedivid") from a button or whatever. A big plus for this approach it provides a general solution to printing selected content from within a page.  It also allows use of existing styles for elements that are printed - including the containing div.  NOTE:  In my implementation, this must be the first style sheet.  Change the sheet references (0) to the appropriate sheet number if you need to make it later in the sheet sequence. Use a special Stylesheet for printingand then add a class i.e. "noprint" to every tag which\'s content you don\'t want to print.In the CSS use If you only want to print this div, you must use the instruction:The printDiv() function came out a few times, but in that case, you loose all your binding elements and input values. So, my solution is to create a div for everything called "body_allin" and another one outside the first one called "body_print".Then you call this function:You could use a separate CSS style which disables every other content except the one with the id "printarea".See CSS Design: Going to Print for further explanation and examples.@Kevin Florida\nIf you have multiple divs with same class, you can use it like this:i was using Colorbox inner content typeIn my case I had to print a image inside a page. When I used the solution voted, I had 1 blank page and the other one showing the image. Hope it will help someone.Here is the css I used:My html is:You can use this:\nhttp://vikku.info/codesnippets/javascript/print-div-content-print-only-the-content-of-an-html-element-and-not-the-whole-document/Or use visibility:visible and visibility:hidden css property together with @media print{}\'display:none\' will hide all nested \'display:block\'. That is not solution.I had multiple images each with a button and needed to click on a button to print each div with an image. This solution works if I have disabled cache in my browser, and the image size doesn\'t change in Chrome:
