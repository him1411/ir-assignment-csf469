What is the best way (or even the various ways) to pretty print xml in Python?lxml is recent, updated, and includes a pretty print functionCheck out the lxml tutorial:\nhttp://lxml.de/tutorial.htmlAnother solution is to borrow this indent function, for use with the ElementTree library that\'s built in to Python since 2.5.\nHere\'s what that would look like:Here\'s my (hacky?) solution to get around the ugly text node problem.The above code will produce:Instead of this:Disclaimer: There are probably some limitations.As others pointed out, lxml has a pretty printer built in.Be aware though that by default it changes CDATA sections to normal text, which can have nasty results.Here\'s a Python function that preserves the input file and only changes the indentation (notice the strip_cdata=False). Furthermore it makes sure the output uses UTF-8 as encoding instead of the default ASCII (notice the encoding=\'utf-8\'):Example usage:If you have xmllint you can spawn a subprocess and use it. xmllint --format <file> pretty-prints its input XML to standard output.Note that this method uses an program external to python, which makes it sort of a hack.If you\'re using a DOM implementation, each has their own form of pretty-printing built-in:If you\'re using something else without its own pretty-printer\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89or those pretty-printers don\'t quite do it the way you want\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89 you\'d probably have to write or subclass your own serialiser.I tried to edit "ade"s answer above, but Stack Overflow wouldn\'t let me edit after I had initially provided feedback anonymously.  This is a less buggy version of the function to pretty-print an ElementTree.I had some problems with minidom\'s pretty print.  I\'d get a UnicodeError whenever I tried pretty-printing a document with characters outside the given encoding, eg if I had a \xce\xb2 in a document and I tried doc.toprettyxml(encoding=\'latin-1\').  Here\'s my workaround for it:It won\'t add spaces or newlines inside text nodes, unless you ask for it with:You can specify what the indentation unit should be and what the newline should look like.The doc is on http://www.yattag.org homepage.BeautifulSoup has a easy to use prettify() function. It indents one space per indentation level. It works much better than lxml\'s pretty_print and is short and sweet. XML pretty print for python looks pretty good for this task.  (Appropriately named, too.)An alternative is to use pyXML, which has a PrettyPrint function.I wrote a solution to walk through an existing ElementTree and use text/tail to indent it as one typically expects.Take a look at the vkbeautify module.It is a python version of my very popular javascript/nodejs plugin with the same name. It can pretty-print/minify XML, JSON and CSS text. Input and output can be string/file in any combinations. It is very compact and doesn\'t have any dependency.Examples:An alternative if you don\'t want to have to reparse, there is the xmlpp.py library with the get_pprint() function. It worked nice and smoothly for my use cases, without having to reparse to an lxml ElementTree object.I had this problem and solved it like this:In my code this method is called like this:This works only because etree by default uses two spaces to indent, which I don\'t find very much emphasizing the indentation and therefore not pretty. I couldn\'t ind any setting for etree or parameter for any function to change the standard etree indent. I like how easy it is to use etree, but this was really annoying me.You can use popular external library xmltodict, with unparse and pretty=True you will get best result:full_document=False against <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> at the top.I solved this with some lines of code, opening the file, going trough it and adding indentation, then saving it again. I was working with small xml files, and did not want to add dependencies, or more libraries to install for the user. Anyway, here is what I ended up with:It works for me, perhaps someone will have some use of it :)
