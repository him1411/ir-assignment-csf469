Is it possible to find the foreach index?in a for loop as follows:$i will give you the index.Do I have to use the for loop or is there some way to get the index in the foreach loop?$key is the index of each $array elementYou can put a hack in your foreach, such as a field incremented on each run-through, which is exactly what the for loop gives you in a numerically-indexed array. Such a field would be a pseudo-index that needs manual management (increments, etc).A foreach will give you your index in the form of your $key value, so such a hack shouldn\'t be necessary.e.g., in a foreachIt should be noted that you can call key() on any array to find the current key its on. As you can guess current() will return the current value and next() will move the array\'s pointer to the next element. Owen has a good answer.  If you want just the key, and you are working with an array this might also be useful.You can create $i outside the loop and do $i++ at the bottom of the loop.These two loops are equivalent (bar the safety railings of course):egPHP arrays have internal pointers, so try this:Works okay for me (only very preliminarily tested though).Jonathan is correct.  PHP arrays act as a map table mapping keys to values.  in some cases you can get an index if your array is defined, such as your output will be in which case each element in the array has a knowable index, but if you then do something like the followingyou get no output.  This happens because arrays in PHP are not linear structures like they are in most languages.  They are more like hash tables that may or may not have keys for all stored values.  Hence foreach doesn\'t use indexes to crawl over them because they only have an index if the array is defined.  If you need to have an index, make sure your arrays are fully defined before crawling over them, and use a for loop.I normally do this when working with associative arrays:This will work fine with non-associative arrays too.  $key will be the index value.  If you prefer, you can do this too:i think best option is like same:it is easy and normally
