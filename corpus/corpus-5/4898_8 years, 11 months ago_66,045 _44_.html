We recently had a problem where, after a series of commits had occurred, a backend process failed to run. Now, we were good little boys and girls and ran rake test after every check-in but, due to some oddities in Rails\' library loading, it only occurred when we ran it directly from Mongrel in production mode.I tracked the bug down and it was due to a new Rails gem overwriting a method in the String class in a way that broke one narrow use in the runtime Rails code.Anyway, long story short, is there a way, at runtime, to ask Ruby where a method has been defined? Something like whereami( :foo ) that returns /path/to/some/file.rb line #45? In this case, telling me that it was defined in class String would be unhelpful, because it was overloaded by some library. I cannot guarantee the source lives in my project, so grepping for \'def foo\' won\'t necessarily give me what I need, not to mention if I have many def foo\'s, sometimes I don\'t know until runtime which one I may be using.This is really late, but here\'s how you can find where a method is defined:http://gist.github.com/76951If you\'re on Ruby 1.9+, you can use source_locationNote that this won\'t work on everything, like native compiled code. The Method class has some neat functions, too, like Method#owner which returns the file where the method is defined.EDIT: Also see the __file__ and __line__ and notes for REE in the other answer, they\'re handy too. -- wgYou can actually go a bit further than the solution above.  For Ruby 1.8 Enterprise Edition, there is the __file__ and __line__ methods on Method instances:For Ruby 1.9 and beyond, there is source_location (thanks Jonathan!):I\'m coming late to this thread, and am surprised that nobody mentioned Method#owner.Copying my answer from a newer similar question that adds new information to this problem.Ruby 1.9 has method called source_location: Returns the Ruby source filename and line number containing this method or nil if this method was not defined in Ruby (i.e. native)This has been backported to 1.8.7 by this gem:So you can request for the method:And then ask for the source_location of that method:This will return an array with filename and line number.\nE.g for ActiveRecord::Base#validates this returns:For classes and modules, Ruby does not offer built in support, but there is an excellent Gist out there that builds upon source_location to return file for a given method or first file for a class if no method was specified:In action:On Macs with TextMate installed, this also pops up the editor at the specified location.This may help but you would have to code it yourself.  Pasted from the blog:Ruby provides a method_added()\n  callback that is invoked every time a\n  method is added or redefined within a\n  class. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of the Module class,\n  and every Class is a Module. There are\n  also two related callbacks called\n  method_removed() and\n  method_undefined().http://scie.nti.st/2008/9/17/making-methods-immutable-in-rubyIf you can crash the method, you\'ll get a backtrace which will tell you exactly where it is.Unfortunately, if you can\'t crash it then you can\'t find out where it has been defined.  If you attempt to monkey with the method by overwriting it or overriding it, then any crash will come from your overwritten or overridden method, and it won\'t be any use.Useful ways of crashing methods:Very late answer :) But earlier answers did not help meYou might be able to do something like this:foo_finder.rb:Then ensure foo_finder is loaded first with something like (I\'ve only messed with rails, so I don\'t know exactly, but I imagine there\'s a way to start it sort of like this.)This will show you all the re-definitions of String#foo. With a little meta-programming, you could generalize it for whatever function you want.   But it does need to be loaded BEFORE the file that actually does the re-definition.You can always get a backtrace of where you are by using caller().Maybe the source_location can help to find where is the method come from.ex: ModelName.method(:has_one).source_locationReturn[project_path/vendor/ruby/version_number/gems/activerecord-number/lib/active_record/associations.rb",\n  line_number_of_where_method_is]ORModelName.new.method(:valid?).source_locationReturn project_path/vendor/ruby/version_number/gems/activerecord-number/lib/active_record/validations.rb",\n  line_number_of_where_method_is]
