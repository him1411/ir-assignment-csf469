I have downloaded the latest cURL zip file from the website, ver 7.24.0.\nNow how do I install this in my windows environment to be able to use it? I do not need to build cURL from the source just to use it.Do I need to compile it?If yes, then how do I do that? I looked for any documentation on installation, but that points to installing cURL as project from source.Assuming you got it from https://curl.haxx.se/download.html, just unzip it wherever you want. No need to install. If you are going to use SSL, you need to download the OpenSSL DLLs, available from curl\'s website.On the curl download page there\'s a link to the download wizard. Complete all the steps as follows:If you chose Windows / Win32 you should end up here, a page that links to http://www.paehl.com/open_source/?CURL_x.y.z (x.y.z will change as newer versions of curl are released). There you can click the first link ("Download WITHOUT SSL") or second link ("Download WITH SUPPORT SSL") for a zip file with curl.exe. If you chose Win64 you should end up on this page which should have direct download links from the https://curl.haxx.se website. These too contain only curl.exe.Finally, you can copy curl.exe into %windir% and it should become available on the command line.curl.exe is in the bin folder of the downloaded / extracted curl folder.To run curl from the command line a) Right-hand-click on "My Computer" iconb) Select Propertiesc) Click \'Advanced system settings\' linkd) Go to tab [Advanced] - \'Environment Variables\' buttone) Under System variable select \'Path\' and Edit buttonf) Add a semicolon followed by the path to where you placed your curl.exe (e.g. ;D:\\software\\curl)Now you can run from the command line by typing: The simplest tutorial for setting up cURL on Windows is the Making cURL work on Windows 7. It only have 3 easy steps.Even more easier:Download the Win64 2000/XP x86_64 MSI installer provided by Edward LoPinto. At the time of writing file curl-7.46.0-win64.exe was the most recent. Tested with Windows 10.It\'s probably worth noting that Powershell v3 and up, contains a cmdlet called Invoke-WebRequest that has some curl-ish capabilities. The New-WebServiceProxy and Invoke-RestMethod cmdlets are probably worth mentioning too. I\'m not sure they will fit your needs or not, but although I\'m not a Windows guy, I have to say I find the object approach PS takes, a lot easier to work with than utilities such as curl, wget etc.  They may be worth taking a look atAs you already know, you can find several packages of binaries on the official curl website.Once you download a package, unzip it wherever you want. I recommend adding its location to your path, so you can call curl from batch or powershell scripts. To add a directory to your path type "environment variables" in the start menu, and select "edit user environment variables". Select Path, and add to the end of the "value" box: ;C:\\curl\\directory (with the directory changed to where you saved curl.)If you want to use SSL you need a certificate bundle. Run either mk-ca-bundle.pl (perl) or mk-ca-bundle.vbs (VBScript). Some of the packages of binaries include one or both of them. If your download doesn\'t include one, download one here: https://github.com/bagder/curl/tree/master/lib. I recommend mk-ca-bundle.vbs, as on windows you simply double click it to run it. It will produce a file called ca-bundle.crt. Rename it curl-ca-bundle.crt and save it in the directory with curl.exe.Alternatively, I recently developed an msi installer that sets up a full featured build of curl with just a few clicks. It automatically ads curl to your path, includes a ready-to-use ssl certificate bundle, and makes the curl manual and documentation accessible from the start menu. You can download it at www.confusedbycode.com/curl/.I had a lot of issues with curl for Windows. I finally used Cygwin, which includes curl by default.Note also that installing Git for Windows from git-scm.com also installs Curl. You can then run Curl from Git for Windows\' BASH terminal (not the default Windows CMD terminal).You can build the latest version of curl, openssl, libssh2 and zlib in 3 simple\nsteps by following this tutorial.Curl is built statically so you do not have to distribute the prerequisite dynamic runtime.You can also download a prebuilt version (x86 and x64) from SourceForge.This installer made it easy for me\nhttp://www.confusedbycode.com/curl/The link describes how to use it. Here\'s a summary taken from the website above:"You can install cURL for Windows with only a few clicks. Just download and run an installer from the table below, and click Install. The default installation includes:To include developers\' files in your installation, click Advanced. The developers\' files include libcurl.dll, libeay32.dll, ssleay32.dll, libssh2.dll, zlib.dll, msvcr120.dll, C headers, libs, and code examples.When you click Advanced you can also choose whether or not to install the documentation and manuals, and whether or not to add cURL to your path.If you don\'t have administrator privileges on your computer, use one of the files from the "Without Administrator Privileges" row. These install cURL in C:\\Users\\Name\\AppData\\Local\\Apps.If you do not want to use the installer, but still want the contents listed above, you can download one of the zip archives."I was looking for the download process of Curl and every where they said copy curl.exe file in System32 but they haven\'t provided the direct link. so here it is enjoy, find curl.exe easily in bin folder just unzip it and then go to bin folder there you get exe filelink to download curl genericJust download curl and extract the compressed file. You will get the file "curl.exe". Open a CMD Shell, drag the file curl.exe into the CMD Shell, now you can use curl.After adding curl.exe\'s path to the System Variable \'Path\'you can open command prompt and run \'curl -V\' to see if it is working.Thought I\'d write exactly what I did (Windows 10, 64-bit):From the download page https://curl.haxx.se/download.html choose the download wizard https://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/Choose curl executable. Choose Win64. Choose generic. Choose any. Choose x86_64.Choose the first recommended option. For me this was: curl version: 7.53.1 - SSL enabled SSH enabled. Provided by: Viktor Szak\xc3\xa1ts. This package is type curl executable You will get a pre-built \'curl\' binary from this link (or in some cases, by using the information that is provided at the page this link takes you). You may or may not get \'libcurl\' installed as a shared library/DLL.\nThe file is packaged using 7zip. 7zip is a file archiving format.Click download.You should have the file curl-7.53.1-win64-mingw.7z in your downloads folder.Install 7-Zip if you don\'t have it.Right-click, 7-Zip, Extract Here. Copy and paste the extracted file somewhere like Z:\\Tools\\If you look in the bin folder you\'ll see curl.exe. If you double-click it a window will quickly flash up and vanish. To run it you need to use the Command Prompt. Navigate to the bin folder and type curl followed by your parameters to make a request. You must use double-quotes. Single quotes won\'t work with curl on Windows.Now you\'ll want to add curl to a user\'s Path variable so you don\'t have to navigate to the right folder to run the program. Go to This PC, Computer, System Properties, Advanced system settings, authenticate as an administrator (you\'re not running as admin, right? Right?) Environment Variables, System variables, look at the list and select Path, then Edit, then New, then, e.g.Z:\\Tools\\curl-7.53.1-win64-mingw\\bin You can add a trailing backslash if you like, I don\'t think it matters. Click move up until it\'s at the top of the list, then you can see it easily from the previous screen. Click OK, OK, OK, then crack open a Command Prompt and you can run curl by typing curl from any folder, as any user. Don\'t forget your double-quotes.This is the answer I wish I\'d had.Statically built WITH ssl for windows: http://sourceforge.net/projects/curlforwindows/files/?source=navbarYou need curl-7.35.0-openssl-libssh2-zlib-x64.7z..and for ssl all you need to do is add "-k" in addition to any other of your parameters and the bundle BS problem is gone; no CA verification.I have successfully used Windows curl-installer: http://open-edx-windows-7-installation-instructions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/6_Install_cURL_for_Windows.htmlby using cURL for Windows direct download link with msi-installer.\nRemember to reboot your system after installing.
