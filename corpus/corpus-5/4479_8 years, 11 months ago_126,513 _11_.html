I want to print the full length of a C-string in GDB.  By default it\'s being abbreviated, how do I force GDB to print the whole string?From the GDB manual: As long as your program\'s in a sane state, you can also call (void)puts(your_string) to print it to stdout. Same principle applies to all functions available to the debugger, actually.There is a third option: the x command, which allows you to set a different limit for the specific command instead of changing a global setting. To print the first 300 characters of a string you can use x/300s your_string. The output might be a bit harder to read. For example printing a SQL query results in:The printf command will print complete strings:Just to complete it:You must give a length, but may change the representation of that string:This may be useful if you want to debug by their valuesUsing set elements ... isn\'t always the best way. It would be useful if there were a distinct set string-elements ....So, I use these functions in my .gdbinit:Caveats:
