I am trying to determine the best way to have a single ListView that contains different layouts for each row. I know how to create a custom row + custom array adapter to support a custom row for the entire list view, but how can I implement many different row styles in the ListView?Since you know how many types of layout you would have - it\'s possible to use those methods.getViewTypeCount() - this methods returns information how many types of rows do you have in your listgetItemViewType(int position) - returns information which layout type you should use based on positionThen you inflate layout only if it\'s null and determine type using getItemViewType.Look at this tutorial for further information.To achieve some optimizations in structure that you\'ve described in comment I would suggest:I hope that will help you. If you could provide some XML stub with your data structure and information how exactly you want to map it into row, I would be able to give you more precise advise. By pixel.I know how to create a custom row + custom array adapter to support a custom row for the entire list view. But how can one listview support many different row styles?You already know the basics. You just need to get your custom adapter to return a different layout/view based on the row/cursor information being provided.A ListView can support multiple row styles because it derives from AdapterView:An AdapterView is a view whose children are determined by an Adapter.If you look at the Adapter, you\'ll see methods that account for using row-specific views:The latter two methods provide the position so you can use that to determine the type of view you should use for that row.Of course, you generally don\'t use AdapterView and Adapter directly, but rather use or derive from one of their subclasses. The subclasses of Adapter may add additional functionality that change how to get custom layouts for different rows.  Since the view used for a given row is driven by the adapter, the trick is to get the adapter to return the desired view for a given row. How to do this differs depending on the specific adapter.For example, to use ArrayAdapter,But to use derivatives of CursorAdapter,However, to use SimpleCursorAdapter,Look up the specific examples/tutorials for the kind of adapter you end up using.Take a look in the code below.First, we create custom layouts. In this case, four types.even.xmlodd.xmlwhite.xmlblack.xmlThen, we create the listview item. In our case, with a string and a type. After that, we create a view holder. It\'s strongly recommended because Android OS keeps the layout reference to reuse your item when it disappears and appears back on the screen. If you don\'t use this approach, every single time that your item appears on the screen Android OS will create a new one and causing your app to leak memory. Finally, we create our custom adapter overriding getViewTypeCount() and getItemViewType(int position). And our activity is something like this:now create a listview inside mainactivity.xml\nlike thisIn your custom array adapter, you override the getView() method, as you presumably familiar with. Then all you have to do is use a switch statement or an if statement to return a certain custom View depending on the position argument passed to the getView method. Android is clever in that it will only give you a convertView of the appropriate type for your position/row; you do not need to check it is of the correct type. You can help Android with this by overriding the getItemViewType() and getViewTypeCount() methods appropriately.If we need to show different type of view in list-view then its good to use  getViewTypeCount() and getItemViewType() in adapter instead of  toggling a view VIEW.GONE and VIEW.VISIBLE can be very expensive task inside getView() which will affect the list scroll.Please check this one for use of getViewTypeCount() and getItemViewType() in Adapter.Link : the-use-of-getviewtypecountListView was intended for simple use cases like the same static view for all row items.\nSince you have to create ViewHolders and make significant use of getItemViewType(), and dynamically show different row item layout xml\'s, you should try doing that using the RecyclerView, which is available in Android API 22.  It offers better support and structure for multiple view types.  Check out this tutorial on how to use the RecyclerView to do what you are looking for.
