I have the following code......the idea being that I can have multi-line text for the button, but the text is always obscured by the backgroundImage of the UIButton. A logging call to show the subviews of the button shows that the UILabel has been added, but the text itself cannot be seen. Is this a bug in UIButton or am I doing something wrong?For iOS 6 and above, use the following to allow multiple lines:For iOS 5 and below use the following to allow multiple lines:For iOS9 forward,generally, simply choose "Attributed Text" and then select "character wrap" (or whatever mode preferred).The selected answer is correct but if you prefer to do this sort of thing in Interface Builder you can do this:For IOS 6 :As are deprecated in IOS 6 onwards..If you want to add a button with the title centered with multiple lines, set your Interface Builder\'s settings for the button:[]To restate Roger Nolan\'s suggestion, but with explicit code, this is the general solution:There is a much easier way:(Edit for iOS 3 and later:)Left align on iOS7 with autolayout:First of all, you should be aware that UIButton already has a UILabel inside it. You can set it using \xe2\x80\x93setTitle:forState:.The problem with your example is that you need to set UILabel\'s numberOfLines property to something other than its default value of 1. You should also review the lineBreakMode property.For those who are using Xcode 4\'s storyboard, you can click on the button, and on the right side Utilities pane under Attributes Inspector, you\'ll see an option for Line Break. Choose Word Wrap, and you should be good to go.As to Brent\'s idea of putting the title UILabel as sibling view, it doesn\'t seem to me like a very good idea. I keep thinking in interaction problems with the UILabel due to its touch events not getting through the UIButton\'s view. On the other hand, with a UILabel as subview of the UIButton, I\'m pretty confortable knowing that the touch events will always be propagated to the UILabel\'s superview.I did take this approach and didn\'t notice any of the problems reported with backgroundImage. I added this code in the -titleRectForContentRect: of a UIButton subclass but the code can also be placed in drawing routine of the UIButton superview, which in that case you shall replace all references to self with the UIButton\'s variable.I did take the time and wrote a bit more about this here. There, I also point a shorter solution, though it doesn\'t quite fit all the scenarios and involves some private views hacking. Also there, you can download an UIButton subclass ready to be used.Answers here tell you how to achieve multiline button title programmatically. I just wanted to add that if you are using storyboards, you can type [Ctrl+Enter] to force a newline on a button title field. HTHIf you use auto-layout on iOS 6 you might also need to set the preferredMaxLayoutWidth property:Setting lineBreakMode to NSLineBreakByWordWrapping (either in IB or code) makes button label multiline, but doesn\'t affect button\'s frame.If button has dynamic title, there is one trick: put hidden UILabel with same font and tie it\'s height to button\'s height with layout; when set text to button and label and autolayout will make all the work.NoteIntrinsic size height of one-line button is bigger than label\'s, so to prevent label\'s height shrink it\'s vertical Content Hugging Priority must be greater than button\'s vertical Content Compression Resistance.It works perfectly.Add to use this with config file like Plist, you need to use CDATA to write the multilined title, like this:If you use auto-layout.Roll your own button class. It\'s by far the best solution in the long run. UIButton and other UIKit classes are very restrictive in how you can customize them.Although it\'s okay to add a subview to a control, there\'s no guarantee it\'ll actually work, because the control might not expect it to be there and might thus behave poorly.  If you can get away with it, just add the label as a sibling view of the button and set its frame so that it overlaps the button; as long as it\'s set to appear on top of the button, nothing the button can do will obscure it.In other words:
