I have a repository in GitHub and I need to tag it. I tagged in a shell, but on GitHub it is not showing up. Do I have to do anything else?The command I used in shell is:and now when I type git tag it shows:so it seems like tags are present, correct?The repository is: https://github.com/keevitaja/myseo-pyrocms.How do I make this tag show up on GitHub? Where are my tags?You can create tags for GitHub by either using:To create a tag on your current branch, run this:This will create a local tag with the current state of the branch you are on. When pushing to your remote repo, tags are NOT included by default. You will need to explicitly say that you want to push your tags to your remote repo:From the official Linux Kernel Git documentation for git push:All refs under refs/tags are pushed, in addition to refspecs explicitly listed on the command line.Or if you just want to push a single tag:See also my answer to Push a tag to a remote repository using Git? for more details about that syntax above.You can find GitHub\'s instructions for this at their Creating Releases help page. Here is a summary:Click the releases link on our repository page,Click on Create a new release or Draft a new release,Fill out the form fields, then click Publish release at the bottom,\nAfter you create your tag on GitHub, you might want to fetch it into your local repository too:You just have to push the tag after you run the git tag 2.0 command.So just do git push --tags now.
