I am trying to implement the new ActionBar support library that was released by Google a couple days ago.  In the past, I have successfully implemented ActionBarSherlock without any issues using the same method listed on Google Developer\'s Support Library Setup page - using the guide on how to include the resources (which is similar to how ActionBarSherlock did it). I have the library project loaded in to my own project as a library as well.I can tell the library is loading fine. When, instead of extending Activity on my MainActivity.java, I changed it to extend ActionBarActivity (as per Google\'s instructions), no errors occur - and it imports correctly.I even tried bypassing the style.xml file and adding @style/Theme.AppCompat.Light directly in to the AndroidManifest.xml for both <application> and <activity> with android:theme="@style/ThemeAppCompat.Light" with all attempts resulting in the same error.Now the issue is I cannot get it to change the theme, let alone even build without throwing an error.  Below is the error I am receiving, followed by the style.xml file I changed to use the new theme.I have moderate experience working with Android apps and am running Eclipse with the latest version of the Support Libraries and SDK compiling with API 18 (Android 4.3).Error Received During Builderror: Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name \'@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light\'. styles.xml  /ActBarTest/res/values  line 3  Android AAPT Problemstyle.xmlAny suggestions?  This was never an issue with ActionBarSherlock. I want to work on using this new support library.  It almost seems like the .jar is loading, but not the resources.You need to do next:Note: if  you are  using "android:showAsAction" in menu item, you need to change prefix android as in  the example http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.htmlIf, like me, you are following the Android tutorial on http://developer.android.com/training/basics/actionbar/setting-up.html and keep getting this error, try to change the AppBaseTheme style in all styles.xml files. In detail:In file res/values/styles.xml change the line:to:In file res/values-v11/styles.xml change the line:to:In file res/values-v14/styles.xml change the line:to:Now the application should run fine.I will share my experience with this problem. I was going crazy because of this, but I found out that the problem was a bug with Eclipse itself, rather than my code:\nIn eclipse, unable to reference an android library project in another android projectSo, if you have the Android Support Library in your C: drive and your project in the D: drive on your computer, Eclipse won\'t function correctly and won\'t know where the Android Support Library is (green tick turns into red cross). To solve this, you need to move both projects onto the same hard drive.I did the following in Eclipse with the Android Support Library (APL) project and the Main Project (MP):Ensured both APL and MP had the same minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion.Added APL as a build dependency for MP:Going into "Properties > Java Build Path" of MP, and thenSelecting the "Projects" tab and adding APL.In the properties of MP, under "Android", added a reference to APL under library.1 and 2 got the references to Java classes working fine...however I still saw the error in the manifest.xml for MP when trying to reference @style/Theme.AppCompat.Light from APL. This only went away when I performed step 3.This is an issue that can happen in Android Studio if you modify Project Structure Modules.\nIn this case you may need to add the dependencies again. In a text editor edit the \'build.gradle\' file to include the required dependencies:This should update your \'{your_project_name}.iml\' file with lib components:Its bit late but here is how I get it done in AndroidStudio !Right click on app to goto properties\nGo to Dependencies and click on \'+\' sign and choose library dependency\n\nChoose appcompat-v7\n1. Run Android SDK Manager and install the latest SDK and Android Support Libarary. The version of SDK and Android Support Libarary should be the same! 23 in my case. Another variants will give you the errors. \n \n 2. Change SDK version of your IDEA project to the last one you installed in previous step. (ps. you may not use Maven). \n3. Add new Module from existing sourse to your IDEA project. \n4. Add AppCompat project. !!! Should be under the last SDK too!  (ps. Say "Yes" anywhere in process of this step)\n5. Open settings of your main Project Module and add to it next 3 dependecies:5.1.  Module Dependency. Chose android-support-v7-appcompat\n5.2. 2 pc. Library Dependencies. Add android-sdk\\extras\\android\\support\\v7\\appcompat\\libs\\android-support-v4.jar and android-support-v4\\android-support-v7-appcompat.jar\nIn total it will be:\n6. Very important!!!  Add theme with prefix @style (not another!).\n1. Run Android SDK Manager and install the latest SDK and Android Support Libarary. The version of SDK and Android Support Libarary should be the same! 23 in my case. Another variants will give you the errors. \n 2. Add next to build.gradleP.S. If you are new in Android developing, I strongly recomend you move to Android Studio & Gradle right now - you will get the simplest way of managing your android app.For Android Studio 1.2.2Drop "android" from the parent attribute value:you need reference $ANDROID_SDK/extras/android/support/v7/appcompatFor IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio:Add this to app.gradle build fileReplace  -v:xx.0+, with your build target, if you have 19 platform\nthen it must be like:Follow the steps of @rcdmk.\nDelete the android support v4.jar in YOUR project. It conflicts with the new updated version found in appcompat.My issue resolve via following Stepsadd following file to project\'s libs directory <SDK-PATH>\\extras\\android\\support\\v13android-support-v13.jarRestart Eclipse if required. That\'s it. Your problem should be disappeared.I had same problem and waste my 4-5 hours for solution. My problem solved with;Hope you will find your solution.works:Since the Import dialouge is different in Android Studio 1.0.1, I could\'t get Svyatoslav Lobachs version to work.Instead I downloaded "Android Support Repository" in the SDK Manager. Then addedto build.gradle. Worked for me.http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html has a bug.\nIn Property->Java build path->\'Project\' and \'Order and Export\', there should not be any jar\'s.\nRemoving them, and checking \'Android Private Libraries\' and \'Android Dependencies\' solved my problem.I experienced the same problem as the OP after right-clicking on my project and selecting Close Unrelated Projects.In my case, I resolved the problem by re-opening the appcompat_v7 project and cleaning/rebuilding both projects.It happened to me when Eclipse(Luna)/AndroidSDK(not Android Stduio) were used with the latest tools and library as of Jan. 14, 2015 during the project like HelloWorld. When I installed those tools and made HelloWorld the first app, I accepted all the defaults. - This is the problem in my case.First, check whether or not the "Android Support Library" library is installed. \nIf not, install it. It is not installed by default. \nYou may do it all in "Android SDK manager" available in the menu.(Android SDK Manager -> Extra -> Android Support Library) Blessings,\n(a debtor)<><Quickest solution :right click on the project - > Android tools -> Add support library..I made a really silly mistake for this. When I was getting same error every time i could not figure out what was wrong. then it clicked me that once I have closed all the projects in my work space and that was the time since all the problems started. SO just check whether your "appcompat_v7" is not closed. If it is  then open the project by double click and then clean and build your project again. In my case the errors were gone. Happy coding!I am not sure whether v13 support library was available when this question was posted, but in case someone is still struggling, I have seen that adding android-support-v13.jar will fix everything.\nThis is how I did it:For Android Studio or IntelliJ, all you need to do is update your dependencies in gradle.build. I used the following:I dont know how many of you noticed this. Support library "appcompat_v7" and your project should be in a same directory(I mean workspace directory). Dont clean your project until its error free else you will have tough time with R.javaYou had better make new project with any name , then use appcompat_v7 that program make new .In the section library Add and choose library appcompat.in eclipse right click on your project-> select build path and then select configure build path. from the window select the jar file that you want and refresh your projectThe accepted solution used to work for me once, but not now. I had to re-create a hello-world of the same kind (!) in a new workspace, made it compile, and then copied all directories, including .hg and .hgignore.\nhg diff shows:It looks like Eclipse wants to compile for API 21 and fails to do anything with API 19. Darkly.If you have added appCompat Library and also have given proper reference of appCompat from SDK location, try "invalidate caches/Restart". \nYou can find it from "File" menu in Android Studio.In my case the problem occurred since I wanted to use a SDK that doesnt include the required library. When I increased the min. SDK level the problem dissappeared. Of course directly including the library\'s itself, should remove the error as well.Forget everything. Just use the appcompat library downloaded using the Android Studio. It has all the missing definitions. No matter whether you are using in Eclipse or not.I had the same issue and even after importing/adding a jar/library as mentioned in the answers it would not solve the error. Out of frustration, I just created a new workspace and created a fresh android project and it automatically imported appcompat_v7 and there were no errors on clean and build. Didn\'t have to import a single jar/ library manually. Just FYI I am using eclipse Mars.1 Release (4.5.1) and was facing the exact same issue everytime I created a new android project.
