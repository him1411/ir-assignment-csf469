Still didn\'t work.\nWhat\'s the error?Visual Studio is configured to show whitespace.Press Ctrl+R, Ctrl+W.Looks like you have the view white space option enabled.  Go to Edit -> Advanced -> and uncheck "View Whitespace"In Visual Studio 2012\nGo to \n\nEdit -> Advanced -> View White Spaces\nOr\nPress Ctrl+R, Ctrl+W~ FOR VISUAL STUDIO 6 ~use: ctrl+shift+8\nto toggle on/off.(or manualy go to: Edit> Advance > "View Whitespaces")goodluck!Works also for Visual Studio 2008, when \n   Tools/Options/Environment/Keyboard/Mapping Scheme: Visual C++ 6 \nis selected.Please press below buttons in combination of \nCtrl + R,WI had the same problem and resolved by pressing Ctrl + R , Ctrl + W.Press ctrl + E followed by S key to remove the lines in Visual Studio 10In visual studio 2015, goto->view->formatting marks, unselect showgo to File -> Preferences -> Settings, this will open two panels side by side, the left one is default setting and the right one is user setting, you can add your setting on right panel, for this you can add "editor.renderWhitespace": "all".
