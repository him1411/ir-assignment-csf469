I\'m working on a site that uses basic authentication. Using Chrome I\'ve logged in using the basic auth. I now want to remove the basic authentication details from the browser and try a different login.How do you clear the current basic authentication details when using Chrome?It seems chrome will always show you the login prompt if you include a username in the url e.g.http://me@example.comThis is not a real full solution, see Mike\'s comment below.You can open an incognito window Ctrl+Shift+n each time you are doing a test. The incognito window will not remember the username and password the last time you entered.To use this trick, make sure to close all incognito windows. All incognito windows share the same cache. In other words, you cannot open multiple independent incognito windows. If you login in one of them and open another one, those two are related and you will see that the new window remembers the authentication information from the first window.The authentication is cleared when you exit Chrome.Note however, that by default Chrome is running apps in the background, so it may not really exit even if you close all Chrome windows. You can either change this behavior under advanced setting, or e.g. under Windows, you can completely exit Chrome by using the Chrome icon in the systray. There should be an icon if Chrome is still running, but maybe you\'ll find it only in the popup with the hidden icons. The context menu of the Chrome icon has an entry to completely exit Chrome, and you can also change the setting for running apps in the background using that menu.all you need to do is to type chrome://restart in the address bar and chrome, with all its apps that are running in background, will restart and the Auth password cache will be cleaned.May be old thread but thought of adding answer to help others. I had the same issue with Advanced ReST Client App, I\'m not able to clear basic authentication from Chrome neither from app. It simply stopped asking for credentials! However, I managed to make it work by relaunching Chrome using About Google Chrome -> Relaunch. Once Chrome is relaunched, when I accessed ReST service, it will ask for user name and password using basic authentication popup.Hope this helps!In Chrome, on the right-hand side of the URL bar when you are at a password protected URL, you should see a small key symbol. Click the symbol and it will take you directly to the Password Management area where you can remove the entry. That will ensure you receive future prompts or have an opportunity to enter a new password and save it.If you do not see the key symbol, that same Password Management area can be accessed by going to Chrome -> Settings -> Passwords and forms -> Manage Passwords. Or more simply, this URL \xe2\x80\x93 chrome://settings/passwords.There is no way to do this in Chrome as yet (Chrome 58)I have found the best solution is to open the url in an Incognito window, which will force you to re-enter the basic authentication credentials.When you want to change the credentials, close the Incognito window and launch another Incognito window.You can also do it via the settings page, chrome://chrome/settingsThen click the link Manage saved passwords.Chrome uses the same Internet Options as IE. Try opening your Internet Options and removing the URL from "Trusted Sites." This should regenerate a 401 call for credentials when you restart the browser and visit the URL again.You may need to remove it from "Intranet Sites" as well.A lot of great suggestions here, I\'ll give the one that I found the most efficient: Just change your password in the site. The old authentication will became outdated and Chrome will request it again.Since I had a terminal open, I did a simple script to change the password and in two keypresses it were incremented. Things changed a lot since the answer was posted. \nNow you will see a small key symbol on the right hand side of the URL bar.\nClick the symbol and it will take you directly to the saved password dialog where you can remove the password.
