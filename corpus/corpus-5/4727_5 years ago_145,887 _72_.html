I\'ve just upgraded to XCode 4.5 GM and found out that you can now apply the \'4" Retina\' size to your view controller in the storyboard.Now if I want to create an application that runs on both iPhone 4 and 5, of course I have to build every window twice, but I also have to detect whether the user has an iPhone with 3.5" or 4" screen and then apply the view.How should I do that?First of all, you shouldn\'t rebuild all your views to fit a new screen, nor use different views for different screen sizes.Use the auto-resizing capabilities of iOS, so your views can adjust, and adapt any screen size.That\'s not very hard, read some documentation about that. It will save you a lot of time.iOS 6 also offers new features about this, but this is still under NDA at the moment.\nBe sure to read the API changelog on Apple Developer website, if you can access to it.Edit: As iOS 6 is now out, check the new AutoLayout capabilities.That said, if you really need to detect the iPhone 5, you can simply rely on the screen size.The iPhone 5\'s screen has a height of 568.\nYou can imagine a macro, to simplify all of this:The use of fabs with the epsilon is here to prevent precision errors, when comparing floating points, as pointed in the comments by H2CO3.So from now on you can use it in standard if/else statements:Edit - Better detectionAs stated by some people, this does only detect a widescreen, not an actual iPhone 5.Next versions of the iPod touch will maybe also have such a screen, so we may use another set of macros.Let\'s rename the original macro IS_WIDESCREEN:And let\'s add model detection macros:This way, we can ensure we have an iPhone model AND a widescreen, and we can redefine the IS_IPHONE_5 macro:Also note that, as stated by @LearnCocos2D, this macros won\'t work if the application is not optimised for the iPhone 5 screen (missing the Default-568h@2x.png image), as the screen size will still be 320x480 in such a case.I don\'t think this may be an issue, as I don\'t see why we would want to detect an iPhone 5 in a non-optimized app.IMPORTANT - iOS 8 supportOn iOS 8, the bounds property of the UIScreen class now reflects the device orientation.\nSo obviously, the previous code won\'t work out of the box.In order to fix this, you can simply use the new nativeBounds property, instead of bounds, as it won\'t change with the orientation, and as it\'s based on a portrait-up mode.\nNote that dimensions of nativeBounds is measured in pixels, so for an iPhone 5 the height will be 1136 instead of 568.If you\'re also targeting iOS 7 or lower, be sure to use feature detection, as calling nativeBounds prior to iOS 8 will crash your app:You can adapt the previous macros the following way:And obviously, if you need to detect an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, use the corresponding screen sizes.Final noteComments and suggestions have been incorporated in this post.\nThanks to everybody.Tested and designed for any combination of SDK and OS:Added iPad types. iPad 2 and iPad mini are non-retina iPads. While iPad Mini 2 & above, iPad 3, 4, iPad Air, Air 2, Air 3, and iPad Pro 9.7 have same logical resolution of 1024. iPad Pro has maxLength of 1366.

These functions is not determining device type, but display mode thus iPhone 5 is the desired result in this example.Usage: http://pastie.org/9687735Note: If e.g. iPhone 6 is in zoomed mode the UI is a zoomed up version of iPhone 5. These functions is not determining device type, but display mode thus iPhone 5 is the desired result in this example. Really simple solutionWe now need to account for iPhone 6 and 6Plus screen sizes. Here\'s an updated answerSome useful infoI\'ve taken the liberty to put the macro by Macmade into a C function, and name it properly because it detects widescreen availability and NOT necessarily the iPhone 5. The macro also doesn\'t detect running on an iPhone 5 in case where the project doesn\'t include the Default-568h@2x.png. Without the new Default image, the iPhone 5 will report a regular 480x320 screen size (in points). So the check isn\'t just for widescreen availability but for widescreen mode being enabled as well.Here is our codes, test passed on ios7/ios8 for iphone4,iphone5,ipad,iphone6,iphone6p, no matter on devices or simulator:I used hfossli\'s answer and translated it to Swiftthis is the macro for my cocos2d project. should be the same for other apps. In Swift, iOS 8+ project I like to make an extension on UIScreen, like:(NOTE: nativeBounds is in pixels).And then the code will be like:So the code makes it clear that this is a check for the main screen, not for the device model.Borrowing from Samrat Mazumdar\'s answer, here\'s a short method that estimates the device screen size.  It works with the latest devices, but may fail on future ones (as all methods of guessing might). It will also get confused if the device is being mirrored (returns the device\'s screen size, not the mirrored screen size)I think it should be good if this macro will work in device and simulator, below are the solution.I found that answers do not include a special case for Simulators. Relying in the size is wrong in so many levels. How about we ask to the system?Taken from Best way to detect hardware type, iPhone4 or iPhone5?, edzio27 answer.This way you can detect device family.  If the project is created using Xcode 6, then use the below mentioned code to detect the devices..If the project was created in Xcode 5 and opened in Xcode 6, then use the below mentioned code to detect the devices.(This code works if no launching images for iPhone 6,6+ are assigned)If you are still using Xcode 5 all together then use the following code to detect the devices (iPhone 6 and 6+ will not be detected)Add a \'New Swift File\'-> AppDelegateEx.swiftadd an extension to AppDelegateusage:This has been answered a hundred times but this solution worked the best for me. It\'s a simple helper function and doesn\'t require extending a system class.Swift 3 Helper:This is because it\'s easy to memorize a phone\'s inch sizes, like, "5.5 inch" or "4.7 inch" device but difficult to remember the exact pixel sizes.This also gives you the opportunity to do something like this:The "defaultValue" ensures that your code will always fallback to a safe size if Apple releases a new device size and you haven\'t updated your app yet.Note that this is specific for phone apps, will need some changes for universal ones.In Swift 3 you can use my simple class KRDeviceType.https://github.com/ulian-onua/KRDeviceTypeIt well documented and supports operators ==, >=, <=.For example to detect if device has bounds of iPhone 6/6s/7, you can just use next comparison:To detect if device has bounds of iPhone 5/5S/SE or earlier (iPhone 4s) you can use next comparison:use the following Code:Here is the correct test of the device, without depending on the orientationUsed to detect iPhone and iPad Devices of all versons.
