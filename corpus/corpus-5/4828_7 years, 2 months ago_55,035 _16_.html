I have added multiple target-action-forControlEvents: to a UIButton. I\'d like to remove all of these in one go without deallocating anything. I will then set new targets.Is this possible and how do I go about it?Call removeTarget:action:forControlEvents:, pass nil for the target, NULL for action, and use a control mask that sets all bits (UIControlEventAllEvents).Objective-CSwift 2Swift 3@progrmr\'s answer in Swift 2:and Swift 3:Note: Swift doesn\'t have NULL, so I tested replacing it with nil and it seems to work fine.Swift:This method stops the delivery of events to the specified target object.Specifying a valid object in the target parameter, this method stops the delivery of the specified events to all action methods associated with that object.Specifying nil for the target parameter, this method prevents the delivery of those events to all action methods of all target objectsobjective-c:swift:For more details https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIControl_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIControl/removeTarget:action:forControlEvents:
