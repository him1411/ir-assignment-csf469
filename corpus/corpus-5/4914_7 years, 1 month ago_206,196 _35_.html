I\'m writing a bash script. I need the current working directory to always be the directory that the script is located in.The default behavior is that the current working directory in the script is that of the shell from which I run it, but I do not want this behavior.The following also works:Try the following simple one-liners:For all UNIX/OSX/LinuxNote: A double dash (--) is used in commands to signify the end of command options, so files containing dashes or other special characters won\'t break the command.For Linux, Mac and other *BSD:With white spaces support:Note: realpath should be installed in the most popular Linux distribution by default  (like Ubuntu), but in some it can be missing, so you have to install it.Otherwise you could try something like that (it will use the first existing tool):For Linux specific:Using GNU readlink on *BSD/Mac:Note: You need to have coreutils installed\n(e.g. 1. Install Homebrew, 2. brew install coreutils).In bashIn bash you can use Parameter Expansions to achieve that, like:but it doesn\'t work if the script is run from the same directory.Alternatively you can define the following function in bash:This function takes 1 argument. If argument has already absolute path, print it as it is, otherwise print $PWD variable + filename argument (without ./ prefix).or here is the version taken from Debian .bashrc file:Related:How to detect the current directory in which I run my shell script?Getting the source directory of a Bash script from withinBash script absolute path with OSXReliable way for a bash script to get the full path to itself?See also:How can I get the behavior of GNU's readlink -f on a Mac?It\'s easy. It works.This script seems to work for me:The pwd command line echoes the location of the script as the current working directory no matter where I run it from.PWD is an environment variable.Get the real path to your script(This is answer to the same my question here: Get the name of the directory where a script is executed)If you just need to print present working directory then you can follow this.Give execute permission:Then execute the script by ./test then you can see the present working directory.
