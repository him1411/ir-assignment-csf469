If I have a navbar in bootstrap with the itemsHow do I set the active class for each menu item when they are active? That is, how can I set class="active" when the angular route is at A very elegant way is to use ng-controller to run a single controller outside of the ng-view:and include in controllers.js:I just wrote a directive to handle this, so you can simply add the attribute bs-active-link to the parent <ul> element, and any time the route changed, it will find the matching link, and add the active class to the corresponding <li>. You can see it in action here: http://jsfiddle.net/8mcedv3b/Example HTML:Javascript:You can have a look at AngularStrap, the navbar directive seems to be what you are looking for:https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/blob/master/src/navbar/navbar.jsTo use this directive:Download AngularStrap from http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap/ Include the script on your page after bootstrap.js:\n<script src="lib/angular-strap.js"></script> Add the directives to your module:\nangular.module(\'myApp\', [\'$strap.directives\']) Add the directive to your navbar:\n<div class="navbar" bs-navbar> Add regexes on each nav item:\n<li data-match-route="/about"><a href="#/about">About</a></li>Here\'s a simple approach that works well with Angular. Within your AngularJS controller:First and foremost, this problem can be solved in a lot of ways. This way might not be the most elegant, but it cerntainly works.Here is a simple solution you should be able to add to any project.  You can just add a "pageKey" or some other property when you configure your route that you can use to key off of. Additionally, you can implement a listener on the $routeChangeSuccess method of the $route object to listen for the successful completion of a route change.When your handler fires you get the page key, and use that key to locate elements that need to be "ACTIVE" for this page, and you apply the ACTIVE class.Keep in mind you need a way to make ALL the elements "IN ACTIVE".  As you can see i\'m using the .pageKey class on my nav items to turn them all off, and I\'m using the .pageKey_{PAGEKEY} to individually turn them on. Switching them all to inactive, would be considered a naive approach, potentially you\'d get better performance by using the previous route to make only active items inactive, or you could alter the jquery selector to only select active items to be made inactive.  Using jquery to select all active items is probably the best solution because it ensures everything is cleaned up for the current route in case of any css bugs that might have been present on the previous route.Which would mean changing this line of code:to this oneHere is some sample code:Given a bootstrap navbar ofAnd an angular module and controller like the following:You can actually use angular-ui-utils\' ui-route directive:or:If you\'re using ui-utils, you may also be interested in ui-router for managing partial/nested views.I find all of these answers a bit over complicated for me, sorry. So I have created a small directive that should work on a per navbar basis:Usage:I use ng-class directive with $location to achieve it.It requires the navbar to be inside a main Controller with access to $location service like this:You can achieve this with a conditional in an angular expression, such as:That being said, I do find an angular directive to be the more "proper" way of doing it, even though outsourcing a lot of this mini-logic can somewhat pollute your code base.I use conditionals for GUI styling every once in a while during development, because it\'s a little quicker than creating directives. I couldn\'t tell you an instance though in which they actually remained in the code base for long. In the end I either turn it into a directive or find a better way to solve the problem.If you would rather not use AngularStrap then this directive should do the trick!. This is a modification of https://stackoverflow.com/a/16231859/910764.JavaScriptHTMLNote: The above HTML classes assume you are using Bootstrap 3.xHeres my take on it.  A little of a combination of answers found on this post.  I had a slightly different case, so my solution involves separating the menu into its own template to be used within the Directive Definition Ojbect then add my navbar to the page I needed it on.  Basically, I had a login page that I didnt want to include my menu on, so I used ngInclude and insert this directive when logged in:Hope this helpsIf you use ui-router, the following example should satisfy your needs based on @DanPantry\'s comment on the accepted answer without adding any controller-side code:You can check the docs for more info on it.Extending myl answer, I needed this to handle an structure like this.-index-events<-active\n---event-list\n---event-edit\n---event-map <-clicked-places\n---place-list\n---place-edit\n---place-mapso instead of matching, I had to use indexOf, in order to validate children links which are formatted to match the condition. So for \'events\':This is a simple solutionIn conjunction with @Olivier\'s AngularStrap answer, I also implemented kevinknelson\'s answer from: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9013.  Natively, the Bootstrap3 navbar was not designed for a single-page (eg Angular) application and thus the menu when on a small screen was not collapsing upon click.JavaScriptHTMLThanks to @Pylinux. I have used his technique and also modified it to support "one" level of drop down menu (sub ul/li), as that is what I needed. See it in action in the fiddle link below. Updated Fiddle based on pylinux\'s answer - http://jsfiddle.net/abhatia/en4qxw6g/I made the following three changes, in order to support one level drop down menu:\n1. Added a class value of dd (dropdown) for "a" element under li which needs to have sub ul list.    2. Updated Javascript to add the following new logic. 3. Updated CSS to the add the following:Hopefully this will be helpful to someone looking to implement single level dropdown menu.If you are working with Angular router, the RouterLinkActive\n directive can be used really elegantly:You can also use this active-link directive https://stackoverflow.com/a/23138152/1387163Parent li will get active class when location matches /url:I suggest using a directive on a link.\nHere is the fiddle.But its not perfect yet. Watch out for the hashbangs ;)Here is the javascript for directive:and here is how it would be used in html:afterwards styling with css:Just to add my two cents in the debate I have made a pure angular module (no jquery), and it will also work with hash urls containing data. (i.g. #/this/is/path?this=is&some=data)You just add the module as a dependency and auto-active to one of the ancestors of the menu. Like this:And the module look like this:* (You can of course just use the directive part)** It\'s also worth noticing that this doesn\'t work for empty hashes (i.g. example.com/# or just example.com) it needs to have at least example.com/#/ or just example.com#/. But this happens automatically with ngResource and the like.This did the trick for me:then you use jquery(works with angular too) to add class active and of course the css:this works if you have your html like this:this will atumatically add class active using the page url and color your background to red if your in www.somesite.com/ee thaen ee is the \'app\' and it will be activeThis is long answered but I thought I\'d share my way:Template:For those using ui-router:For exact match (eg nested states?) use $state.name === \'full/path/to/state\' or ui-sref-active-eq="active"Here\'s another solution for anyone who might be interested. The advantage of this is it has fewer dependencies. Heck, it works without a web server too. So it\'s completely client-side.HTML:Explanation:Here we are generating the links dynamically from an angularjs model using the directive ng-repeat. Magic happens with the methods selectTab() and getTabClass() defined in the controller for this navbar presented below.Controller:Explanation:selectTab() method is called using ng-click directive. So when the link is clicked, the variable selectedTab is set to the name of this link. In the HTML you can see that this method is called without any argument for Home tab so that it will be highlighted when the page loads.The getTabClass() method is called via ng-class directive in the HTML. This method checks if the tab it is in is the same as the value of the selectedTab variable. If true, it returns "active" else returns "" which is applied as the class name by ng-class directive. Then whatever css you have applied to class active will be applied to the selected tab.Just you\'ll have to add the required active-class with required color code. Ex: ng-class="{\'active\': currentNavSelected}" ng-click="setNav"
