Is there a better way than simply trying to open the file?Look up the access() function, found in unistd.h. You can replace your function withYou can also use R_OK, W_OK, and X_OK in place of F_OK to check for read permission, write permission, and execute permission (respectively) rather than existence, and you can OR any of them together (i.e. check for both read and write permission using R_OK|W_OK)Update: Note that on Windows, you can\'t use W_OK to reliably test for write permission, since the access function does not take DACLs into account. access( fname, W_OK ) may return 0 (success) because the file does not have the read-only attribute set, but you still may not have permission to write to the file.Use stat like this:and call it like this:Usually when you want to check if a file exists, it\'s because you want to create that file if it doesn\'t.  Graeme Perrow\'s answer is good if you don\'t want to create that file, but it\'s vulnerable to a race condition if you do: another process could create the file in between you checking if it exists, and you actually opening it to write to it.  (Don\'t laugh... this could have bad security implications if the file created was a symlink!)If you want to check for existence and create the file if it doesn\'t exist, atomically so that there are no race conditions, then use this:Yes. Use stat(). See link.Stat will fail if the file doesn\'t exist, otherwise most likely succeed. If it does exist, but you have no read access to the directory where it exists, it will also fail, but in that case any method will fail (how can you inspect the content of a directory you may not see according to access rights? Simply, you can\'t).Oh, as someone else mentioned, you can also use access(). However I prefer stat(), as if the file exists it will immediately get me lots of useful information (when was it last updated, how big is it, owner and/or group that owns the file, access permissions, and so on).From the Visual C++ help, I\'d tend to go withAlso worth noting mode values of _accesss(const char *path,int mode)00 Existence only02 Write permission 04 Read permission06 Read and write permission As your fopen could fail in situations where the file existed but could not be opened as requested.Edit: Just read Mecki\'s post.  stat() does look like a neater way to go.  Ho hum.I think that access() function, which is found in unistd.h is a good choice for Linux (you can use stat too).You can Use it like this:And you get the following Output:You can use realpath() function.
