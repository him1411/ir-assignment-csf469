My website renders well on the iPhone/Safari browser, with one exception: My text input fields have a weird rounded style which doesn\'t look good at all with the rest of my website.Is there a way to instruct Safari (via CSS or metadata) not to round the input fields and render them rectangular as intended?On iOS 5 and later, good ol\' border-radius does the trick:If you must only remove the rounded corners on iOS or otherwise for some reason cannot normalize rounded corners across platforms, use the prefixed -webkit-border-radius property instead, which is still supported. Of course do note that Apple can choose to drop support for the prefixed property at any time, but considering their other platform-specific CSS features chances are they\'ll keep it around.On legacy versions you had to set -webkit-appearance: none instead:input -webkit-appearance: none; alone does not work.Try adding -webkit-border-radius:0px; in addition.It is the best way to remove the rounded in IOS.Note: Please don\'t use this code for the Select Option. It will have problem on our select.Here is the complete solution for Compass (SCSS):The accepted answer made radio button disappear on Chrome.

This was also for a webview on a native app.I had the same problem but only for the submit button. Needed to remove the inner shadow and rounded corners -I used a simple border-radius: 0; to remove the rounded corners for the text input types.If you use normalize.css, that stylesheet will do something like input[type="search"] { -webkit-appearance: textfield; }.This has a higher specificity than a single class selector like .foo, so be aware that you then can\'t do just .my-field { -webkit-appearance: none; }. If you have no better way to achieve the right specificity, this will help:.my-field { -webkit-appearance: none !important; }Please Try This one:Try Adding input Css like this:In order to render the buttons properly on Safari and other browsers, you\'ll need to give a specific style for the buttons in addition to setting webkit-appearance to none, e.g.:
