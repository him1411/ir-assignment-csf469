Why is Json Request Behavior needed?If I want to restrict the HttpGet requests to my action I can decorate the action with the [HttpPost] attributeExample:Why isn\'t [HttpPost]sufficient?\nWhy the framework "bugs" us with the JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet for every JsonResult that we have. If I want to deny get requests I\'ll add the HttpPost attribute.MVC defaults to DenyGet to protect you against a very specific attack involving JSON requests to improve the liklihood that the implications of allowing HTTP GET exposure are considered in advance of allowing them to occur. This is opposed to afterwards when it might be too late.Note: If your action method does not return sensitive data, then it should be safe to allow the get.Further reading from my Wrox ASP.NET MVC3 bookBy default, the ASP.NET MVC framework does not allow you to respond to\n  an HTTP GET request with a JSON payload. If you need to send JSON in\n  response to a GET, you\'ll need to explicitly allow the behavior by\n  using JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet as the second parameter to the Json\n  method. However, there is a chance a malicious user can gain access to\n  the JSON payload through a process known as JSON Hijacking. You do not\n  want to return sensitive information using JSON in a GET request.
