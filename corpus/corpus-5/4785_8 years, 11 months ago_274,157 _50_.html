I have a one-dimensional array of strings in Javascript that I\'d like to turn into a comma-separated list. Is there a simple way in garden-variety Javascript (or jQuery) to turn that into a comma-separated list? (I know how to iterate through the array and build the string myself by concatenation if that\'s the only way.)The Array.prototype.join() method:Actually, the toString() implementation does a join with commas by default:I don\'t know if this is mandated by the JS spec but this is what most pretty much all browsers seem to be doing.Or (more efficiently):The toString method of an array when called returns exactly what you need - comma-separated list.Here\'s an implementation that converts a two-dimensional array or an array of columns into a properly escaped CSV string. The functions do not check for valid string/number input or column counts (ensure your array is valid to begin with). The cells can contain commas and quotes! Here\'s a script for decoding CSV strings.Here\'s my script for encoding CSV strings:I think this should do it:fiddleBasically all it does is check if the string contains a comma or quote. If it does, then it doubles all the quotes, and puts quotes on the ends. Then it joins each of the parts with a comma.Use the built-in Array.toString method MDN on Array.toString()I usually find myself needing something that also skips the value if that value is null or undefined, etc.So here is the solution that works for me:Most of the solutions here would return \', apple\' if my array would look like the one in my second example. That\'s why I prefer this solution.Taking the initial code:The initial answer of using the join function is ideal. One thing to consider would be the ultimate use of the string. For using in some end textual display:For using in a URL for passing multiple values through in a (somewhat) RESTful manner:Of course, it all depends on the final use. Just keep the data source and use in mind and all will be right with the world.Do you want to end it with an "and"?For this situation, I created an npm module.Try arrford:https://github.com/dawsonbotsford/arrfordTonic linkIf you need to use " and " instead of ", " between the last two items you can do this:There are many methods to convert an array to comma separated listFrom MDNThe join() method joins all elements of an array (or an array-like object) into a string.The codeFrom MDNThe toString() method returns a string representing the specified array and its elements.The codeThe []+ or +[] will convert it into a stringwill output truePapa Parse (browser based) handles commas in values and other edge cases.\nUse Baby Parse for Node.Eg.
