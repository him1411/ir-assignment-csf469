What is the best data type to use for money in c#?As it is described at decimal as:The decimal keyword indicates a 128-bit data type. Compared to\n  floating-point types, the decimal type has more precision and a\n  smaller range, which makes it appropriate for financial and monetary\n  calculations.You can use a decimal as follows:System.DecimalThe Decimal value type represents decimal numbers ranging from positive 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335 to negative 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335. The Decimal value type is appropriate for financial calculations requiring large numbers of significant integral and fractional digits and no round-off errors. The Decimal type does not eliminate the need for rounding. Rather, it minimizes errors due to rounding.I\'d like to point to this excellent answer by zneak on why double shouldn\'t be used.Use the Money pattern from Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture; specify amount as decimal and the currency as an enum. Decimal. If you choose double you\'re leaving yourself open to rounding errorsdecimal has a smaller range, but greater precision - so you don\'t lose all those pennies over time!Full details here:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/364x0z75.aspxAgree with the Money pattern: Handling currencies is just too cumbersome when you use decimals.If you create a Currency-class, you can then put all the logic relating to money there, including a correct ToString()-method, more control of parsing values and better control of divisions.Also, with a Currency class, there is no chance of unintentionally mixing money up with other data.Another option (especially if you\'re rolling you own class) is to use an int or a int64, and designate the lower four digits (or possibly even 2) as "right of the decimal point".  So "on the edges" you\'ll need some "* 10000" on the way in and some "/ 10000" on the way out.  This is the storage mechanism used by Microsoft\'s SQL Server, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/library/ms179882.aspxThe nicity of this is that all your summation can be done using (fast) integer arithmetic.Create your own class.  This seems odd, but a .Net type is inadequate to cover different currencies.
