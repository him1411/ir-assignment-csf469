I was wondering how to add custom configuration variables to a rails application and how to access them in the controller, for e.g I wanna be able to define an upload_directory in the configuration files say development.rb and be able to access it in one of my controllers.Secondly I was planning to have S3 support for uploads in my application, if i wanted to add a yaml file with the s3 access, secret key, how do I initialize it in my Rails App and how do I access the values that I have defined in that config file.Update 1Very recommended: I\'m going with Rails Config gem nowadays for the fine grained control it provides.Update2If you want a quick solution, then check Jack Pratt\'s answer below.Although my original answer below still works, this answer is now outdated. I recommend looking at updates 1 and 2. Original Answer:For a quick solution, watching the "YAML Configuration File" screen cast by Ryan Bates should be very helpful.In summary:In Rails 3, Application specific custom configuration data can be placed in the application configuration object.

You can also use erb inside the yml file.I really like the settingslogic gem. Very easy to set up and use. https://github.com/binarylogic/settingslogicIf you use Heroku or otherwise have need to keep your application settings as environment variables, the figaro gem is very helpful.I like to use rails-settings for global configuration values that need to be changeable via web interface.I would suggest good approach how to deal with configuration in your application at all.
