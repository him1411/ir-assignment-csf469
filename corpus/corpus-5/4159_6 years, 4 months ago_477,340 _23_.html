This question already has an answer here:Can someone tell me how to detect if "specialword" appears in an array? Example:jQuery offers $.inArray:Note that inArray returns the index of the element found, so 0 indicates the element is the first in the array. -1 indicates the element was not found.Edit 3.5 years later$.inArray is effectively a wrapper for Array.prototype.indexOf in browsers that support it (almost all of them these days), while providing a shim in those that don\'t. It is essentially equivalent to adding a shim to Array.prototype, which is a more idiomatic/JSish way of doing things. MDN provides such code. These days I would take this option, rather than using the jQuery wrapper.Edit another 3 years laterGosh, 6.5 years?!The best option for this in modern Javascript is Array.prototype.includes:No comparisons and no confusing -1 results. It does what we want: it returns true or false. For older browsers it\'s polyfillable using the code at MDN.You really don\'t need jQuery for this.orIt\'s worth noting that array.indexOf(..) is not supported in IE < 9, but jQuery\'s indexOf(...) function will work even for those older versions.  Here you go:This function returns a positive integer (the array index of the given value), or -1 if the given value was not found in the array.Live demo: http://jsfiddle.net/simevidas/5Gdfc/You probably want to use this like so:You can use a for loop:I don\'t like $.inArray(..), it\'s the kind of ugly, jQuery-ish solution that most sane people wouldn\'t tolerate. Here\'s a snippet which adds a simple contains(str) method to your arsenal:Similarly, you could wrap $.inArray in an extension:
