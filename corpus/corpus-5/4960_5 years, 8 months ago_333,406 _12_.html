Is it possible to assign multiple classes to a single HTML container?Something like:Just remove the comma like this:From the standard 7.5.2 Element identifiers: the id and class attributesAttribute definitionsid = name [CS]\n  This attribute assigns a name to an element. This name\n  must be unique in a document.class = cdata-list [CS]\n  This attribute\n  assigns a class name or set of class names to an element. Any number\n  of elements may be assigned the same class name or names. Multiple\n  class names must be separated by white space characters.Yes, just put a space between them. Of course, there are many things you can do with CSS inheritance. Just google it.To assign multiple classes to an html element, include both class names within the quotations of the class attribute and have them separated by a space:In the above example, column and wrapper are two separate css classes, and both of their properties will be applied to the article element.
