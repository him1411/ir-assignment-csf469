My MySQL database contains several tables using different storage engines\n(specifically myisam and innodb).  How can I find out which tables are\nusing which engine?SHOW TABLE STATUS WHERE Name = \'xxx\'This will give you (among other things) an Engine column, which is what you want.To show a list of all the tables in a database and their engines, use this SQL query:Replace dbname with your database name.Less parseable but more readable than SHOW TABLE STATUS.or just show table status; just that this will llist all tables on your database.Bit of a tweak to Jocker\'s response (I would post as a comment, but I don\'t have enough karma yet):This excludes MySQL views from the list, which don\'t have an engine.will format it much nicer compared to the output ofThe \\G trick is also useful to remember for many other queries/commands.will show the info for all tables of a specific database.will do so just for a specific table.If you\'re using the MySQL Workbench, you can right-click the table and select \'alter table\'.In that window you can see your table Engine and also change it.If you are a linux user:To show the engines for all tables for all databases on a mysql server, without tables information_schema, mysql, performance_schema:You might love this, if you are on linux, at least.Will open all info for all tables in less, press -S to chop overly long lines.Example output: go to information_schema database there you will find \'tables\' table then select it;Mysql>use information_schema;\nMysql> select table_name,engine from  tables;Yet another way, perhaps the shortest to get status of a single or matched set of tables:You can then use LIKE operators for example:
