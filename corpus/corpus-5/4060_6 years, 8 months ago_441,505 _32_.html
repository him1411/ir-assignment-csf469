I want to make a TextView\'s content bold, italic and underlined. I tried the following code and it works, but doesn\'t underline.How do I do it? Any quick ideas?I don\'t know about underline, but for bold and italic there is "bolditalic". There is no mention of underline here: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android:textStyleMind you that to use the mentioned bolditalic you need to, and I quote from that pageMust be one or more (separated by \'|\') of the following constant values.so you\'d use bold|italicYou could check this question for underline: Can I underline text in an android layout?This should make your TextView bold, underlined and italic at the same time.strings.xmlTo set this String to your TextView, do this in your main.xml or In JAVA, Sometimes the above approach will not be helpful when you might have to use Dynamic Text. So in that case SpannableString comes into action. OUTPUTOr just like this in Kotlin:Or in Java:Keep it simple and in one line :)For bold and italic whatever you are doing is correct for underscore use following codeHelloAndroid.java  main.xmlstring.xmlThis is an easy way to add an underline, while maintaining other settings:Programmatialy:You can do programmatically using setTypeface() method:Below is the code for default Typefaceand if you want to set custom Typeface:XML:You can set Directly in XML file in  like:Without quotes works for me:If you are reading that text from a file or from the network.You can achieve it by adding HTML tags to your text like mentionedand then you can use the HTML class that processes HTML strings into displayable styled text.
