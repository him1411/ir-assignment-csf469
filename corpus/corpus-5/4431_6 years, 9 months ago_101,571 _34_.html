I would like to configure Visual Studio to open Beyond Compare by default as the diff tool. How can I do this?In Visual Studio, go to the Tools menu, select Options, expand Source Control, (In a TFS environment, click Visual Studio Team Foundation Server),  and click on the Configure User Tools button.Click the Add button.Enter/select the following options for Compare:If using Beyond Compare Professional (3-way Merge):If using Beyond Compare v3/v4 Standard or Beyond Compare v2 (2-way Merge):If you use tabs in Beyond CompareIf you run Beyond Compare in tabbed mode, it can get confused when you diff or merge more than one set of files at a time from Visual Studio. To fix this, you can add the argument /solo to the end of the arguments; this ensures each comparison opens in a new window, working around the issue with tabs.If your using GIT as your source code management system instead of the (fairly dated) TFVC then Visual Studio doesn\'t have options to configure anything like this.\nInstead it (rightly in my opinion) uses the GIT config file\'s setting. So if you already have GIT setup to use Beyond Compare or any other third party comparison software it will just pick this up and start using it.If not then just set that up (see here for further and likely more up to date help). The relevant info for setting up Visual Studio with Beyond Compare 4 is:\n[diff]\n    tool = bc4\n[difftool "bc4"]\n    cmd = \\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Beyond Compare 4\\\\BComp.exe\\" \\"$LOCAL\\" \\"$REMOTE\\"\n[merge]\n    tool = bc4\n[mergetool "bc4"]\n    cmd = \\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Beyond Compare 4\\\\BComp.exe\\" \\"$REMOTE\\" \\"$LOCAL\\" \\"$BASE\\" \\"$MERGED\\"\nNote: I keep coming across this but I am using VS with GIT and the\n  answers aren\'t correct and although some of the comments mention a URL\n  with the correct answer it\'s not clear and if I kept missing it I\'m\n  sure others will so hopefully this will solve that issue.If you are using the TFS, you can find the more information in diff/merge configuration in Team Foundation - common Command and Argument valuesIt shows how to configure the following tools:I got bored of doing this every 6 months when a new version of Visual Studio comes out, or I move PCs, or a new member joins the team. So, PowerShell:Works on my machine. YMMV. No warranties, no refunds. VS doesn\'t appear to cache the key, so takes effect immediately.In Visual Studio 2008 + , go to the In Options Window --> expand Source Control --> Select Subversion User\n  Tools --> Select Beyond Compareand click OK button..VS2013 on 64-bit Windows 7 requires these settings:\nTools | Options | Source Control | Jazz Source ControlCHECK THE CHECKBOX Use an external compare tool ... (easy to miss this)2-Way Compare\nLocation of Executable: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Beyond Compare 3\\BCompare.exe3-Way Conflict Compare\nLocation of Executable: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Beyond Compare 3\\BCompare.exeBComp.exe works in multiple-tabbed scenario as well, so there is no need to add /solo unless you really want separate windows for each file comparison. Tested/verified on Beyond Compare 3 and 4. Moral: use BComp.exe, not BCompare.exe, for VS external compare tool configuration.The answer posted by @schellack is perfect for most scenarios, but I wanted Beyond Compare to simulate the \'2 Way merge with a result panel\' view that Visual Studio uses in its own merge window.This config hides the middle panel (which is unused in most cases AFAIK).With thanks to MorgenI\'m using VS 2017 with projects hosted with Git on visualstudio.com hosting (msdn)The link above worked for me with the "GITHUB FOR WINDOWS" instructions.http://www.scootersoftware.com/support.php?zz=kb_vcs#githubwindowsThe config file was located where it indicated at "c:\\users\\username.gitconfig" and I just changed the BC4\'s to BC3\'s for my situation and used the appropriate path:C:/Program Files (x86)/Beyond Compare 3/bcomp.exe
