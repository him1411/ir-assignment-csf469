I have two Angular controllers:I can\'t use Ctrl1 inside Ctrl2 because it is undefined. However if I try to pass it in like so\xe2\x80\xa6I get an error. Does anyone know how to do this?Doing Also fails.NOTE: These controllers are not nested inside each other.One way to share variables across multiple controllers is to create a service and inject it in any controller where you want to use it.Simple service example:Using the service in a controller:This is described very nicely in this blog (Lesson 2 and on in particular).I\'ve found that if you want to bind to these properties across multiple controllers it works better if you bind to an object\'s property instead of a primitive type (boolean, string, number) to retain the bound reference. Example: var property = { Property1: \'First\' }; instead of var property = \'First\';.UPDATE: To (hopefully) make things more clear here is a fiddle that shows an example of:I like to illustrate simple things by simple examples :)Here is a very simple Service example:And here the jsbinAnd here is a very simple Factory example:And here the jsbinIf that is too simple, here is a more sophisticated exampleAlso see the answer here for related best practices comments--- I know this answer is not for this question, but I want people who reads this question  and want to handle Services such as Factories to avoid trouble doing this ----For this you will need to use a Service or a Factory.The services are the BEST PRACTICE to share data between not nested controllers.A very very good annotation on this topic about data sharing is how to declare objects. I was unlucky because I fell in a AngularJS trap before I read about it, and I was very frustrated. So let me help you avoid this trouble.I read from the "ng-book: The complete book on AngularJS" that AngularJS ng-models that are created in controllers as bare-data are WRONG!A $scope element should be created like this:And not like this:This is because it is recomended(BEST PRACTICE) for the DOM(html document) to contain the calls asThis is very helpful for nested controllers if you want your child controller to be able to change an object from the parent controller....But in your case you don\'t want nested scopes, but there is a similar aspect to get objects from services to the controllers.Lets say you have your service \'Factory\' and in the return space there is an objectA that contains objectB that contains objectC.If from your controller you want to GET the objectC into your scope, is a mistake to say:That wont work...\nInstead use only one dot.Then, in the DOM you can call objectC from objectA. This is a best practice related to factories, and most important, it will help to avoid unexpected and non-catchable errors.Solution without creating Service, using $rootScope:To share properties across app Controllers you can use Angular $rootScope. This is another option to share data, putting it so that people know about it.The preferred way to share some functionality across Controllers is Services, to read or change a global property you can use $rootscope.Using $rootScope in a template (Access properties with $root):The sample above worked like a charm. I just did a modification just in case I need to manage multiple values. I hope this helps!I\'d like to contribute to this question by pointing out that the recommended way to share data between controllers, and even directives, is by using services (factories) as it has been already pointed out, but also I\'d like to provide a working practical example of how to that should be done.Here is the working plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/Q1VdKJP2tpvqqJL1LF6m?p=infoFirst, create your service, that will have your shared data:Then, simply inject it on your controllers and grab the shared data on your scope:You can also do that for your directives, it works the same way:Hope this practical and clean answer can be helpful to someone.I tend to use values, happy for anyone to discuss why this is a bad idea..Then inject the value as per a service.Set in ctrl1:and access from ctrl2:The following example shows how to pass variables between siblings controllers and take an action when the value changes. Use case example: you have a filter in a sidebar that changes the content of another view.Couldn\'t you also make the property part of the scopes parent?  I\'m not saying it\'s right but it works.Ah, have a bit of this new stuff as another alternative. It\'s localstorage, and works where angular works. You\'re welcome. (But really, thank the guy)https://github.com/gsklee/ngStorageDefine your defaults:Access the values:Store the valuesRemember to inject ngStorage in your app and $localStorage in your controller.There are two ways to do this 1) Use get/set service 2)\n$scope.$emit(\'key\', {data: value}); //to set the valueYou could do that with services or factories. They are essentially the same apart for some core differences. I found this explanation on thinkster.io to be the easiest to follow. Simple, to the point and effective.Second Approach :Html : \n\n  For more details see plunker : http://plnkr.co/edit/cKVsPcfs1A1Wwlud2jtO?p=previewIf you don\'t want to make service then you can do like this. Besides $rootScope and services, there is a clean and easy alternative solution to extend angular to add the shared data:in the controllers:This properties belong to \'angular\' object, separated from the scopes, and can be shared in scopes and services.1 benefit of it that you don\'t have to inject the object: they are accessible anywhere immediately after your defination!
