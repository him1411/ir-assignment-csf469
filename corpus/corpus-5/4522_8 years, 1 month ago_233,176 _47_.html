I have created an Android project and added an external JAR (hessian-4.0.1.jar) to my project. I then added the JAR to the build path and checked it off in Order and Export.Order and Export is ignored it seems, and all classes from the external JAR are missing at runtime.Is there a trick to properly include the needed classes from an external JAR when building an Android application using the Eclipse plugin? I do not want to use ant or Maven.Eclipse A good way to add external JARs to your Android project or any Java project is:Now right click on the Jar file and then select Build Path > Add to Build\nPath, which will create a folder called \'Referenced Libraries\' within your\nprojectBy doing this, you will not\nlose your libraries that are being referenced on your\nhard drive whenever you transfer your project to another computer.****** Update *******Step to add external library in Android StudioPlease Note : If you are using 3rd party libraries then it is better to use transitive dependencies where Gradle script automatically downloads the JAR and the dependency JAR when gradle script run.Ex : compile \'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:9.4.0\'Read more about Gradle Dependency Mangement Yes, you can use it. Here is how:This video might be useful in case you are having some issues.I\'m currently using SDK 20.0.3 and none of the previous solutions worked for me. The reason that hessdroid works where hess failed is because the two jar files contain java that is compiled for different virtual machines.  The byte code created by the Java compiler is not guaranteed to run on the Dalvik virtual machine.  The byte code created by the Android compiler is not guaranteed to run on the Java virtual machine.In my case I had access to the source code and was able to create an Android jar file for it using the method that I described here:  https://stackoverflow.com/a/13144382/545064 I know the OP ends his question with reference to the Eclipse plugin, but I arrived here with a search that didn\'t specify Eclipse.  So here goes for Android Studio:That\'s it!Turns out I have not looked good enough at my stack trace, the problem is not that the external JAR is not included.The problem is that Android platform is missing javax.naming.* and many other packages that the external JAR has dependencies too.Adding external JAR files, and setting Order and Export in Eclipse works as expected with Android projects.Goto Current Project RightClick->Properties->Java Build Path->Add Jar Files into Libraries -> Click OK Then it is added into the Referenced Libraries File in your Current Project .Android\'s Java API does not support javax.naming.* and many other javax.* stuff. You need to include the dependencies as separate jars.If using Android Studio, do the following (I\'ve copied and modified @Vinayak Bs answer):in android studio if using gradleadd this to build.gradleand add the jar file to libs folderIf you are using gradle build system, follow these steps:put jar files inside respective libs folder of your android app. You will generally find it at Project > app > libs. If libs folder is missing, create one.add this to your build.gradle file your app. (Not to your Project\'s build.gradle)This will include all your jar files available in libs folder.If don\'t want to include all jar files, then you can add it individually.compile fileTree(dir: \'libs\', include: \'file.jar\')create a folder (like lib) inside your project, copy your jar to that folder.\nnow go to configure build path from right click on project, there in build path select \'add jar\' browse to the folder you created and pick the jar.Copying the .jar file into the Android project\'s folder isn\'t always possible.\nEspecially if it\'s an output of another project in your workspace, and it keeps getting updated.To solve this you\'ll have to add the jar as a linked file to your project, instead of importing it (which will copy it locally).  In the UI choose:Project -> Import -> File System -> yourjar.jar -> (Options area) Advanced -> Create link in workspace.The link is save in the .project file:PARENT-5-PROJECT_LOC means relative to the project file, 5 directories up (../../../../../).Then add it to the libraries:\nProject -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add Jar -> yourjar.jar In the same window choose the Order and Export tab and mark your jar so it will be added to the apk.
