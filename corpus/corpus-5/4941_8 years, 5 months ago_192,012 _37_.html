Is there a way to delete entire directories recursively in Java?In the normal case it is possible to delete an empty directory.\nHowever when it comes to deleting entire directories with contents, it is not that simple anymore.How do you delete entire directories with contents in Java?You should check out Apache\'s commons-io.  It has a FileUtils class that will do what you want.With Java 7, we can finally do this with reliable symlink detection. (I don\'t consider Apache\'s commons-io to have reliable symlink detection at this time, as it doesn\'t handle links on Windows created with mklink.)For the sake of history, here\'s a pre-Java 7 answer, which follows symlinks.In Java 7+ you can use Files class. Code is very simple:Java 7 added support for walking directories with symlink handling:I use this as a fallback from platform-specific methods (in this untested code):(SystemUtils is from Apache Commons Lang. Processes is private but its behavior should be obvious.)Just saw my solution is more or less the same as erickson\'s, just packaged as a static method. Drop this somewhere, it\'s much lighter weight than installing all of Apache Commons for something that (as you can see) is quite simple.A solution with a stack and without recursive methods:One-liner solution (Java8) to delete all files and directories recursively including starting directory:We use a comparator for reversed order, otherwise File::delete won\'t be able to delete possibly non-empty directory. So, if you want to keep directories and only delete files just remove the comparator in sorted() or remove sorting completely and add files filter:Guava had Files.deleteRecursively(File) supported until Guava 9.From Guava 10:Deprecated. This method suffers from poor symlink detection and race conditions. This functionality can be supported suitably only by shelling out to an operating system command such as rm -rf or del /s. This method is scheduled to be removed from Guava in Guava release 11.0.Therefore, there is no such method in Guava 11.Or if you want to handle the IOException:If you have Spring, you can use FileSystemUtils.deleteRecursively:Two ways to fail with symlinks and the above code... and don\'t know the solution.Run this to create a test:Here you see your test file and test directory:Then run your commons-io deleteDirectory(). It crashes saying the file is not found. Not sure what the other examples do here. The Linux rm command would simply delete the link, and rm -r on the directory would also.Run this to create a test:Here you see your test file and test directory:Then run your commons-io deleteDirectory() or the example code people posted. It deletes not only the directory, but your testfile which is outside the directory being deleted. (It dereferences the directory implicitly, and deletes the contents). rm -r would delete the link only. You need to use something like this delete the dereferenced files: "find -L dirtodelete -type f -exec rm {} \\;".You could use:org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.deleteQuietly(destFile);Deletes a file, never throwing an exception. If file is a directory, delete it and all sub-directories. \nThe difference between File.delete() and this method are: \nA directory to be deleted does not have to be empty. \nNo exceptions are thrown when a file or directory cannot be deleted. In legacy projects, I need to create native Java code. I create this code similar to Paulitex code. See that:And the unit test:Here is a bare bones main method that accepts a command line argument, you may need to append your own error checking or mold it to how you see fit.I hope that helps!Maybe a solution for this problem might be to reimplement the delete method of the File class using the code from erickson\'s answer:While files can easily be deleted using file.delete(), directories are required to be empty to be deleted. Use recursion to do this easily. For example: Without Commons IO and  < Java SE 7
