This failed:Apparently, constants can\'t hold arrays. What is the best way to get around this?This seems like unnecessary effort.NOTE: while this is the accepted answer, it\'s worth noting that in PHP 5.6+ you can have const arrays - see Andrea Faulds\' answer below.You can also serialize your array and then put it into the constant:Since PHP 5.6, you can declare an array constant with const:The short syntax works too, as you\'d expect:If you have PHP 7, you can finally use define(), just as you had first tried:You can store them as static variables of a class:If you don\'t like the idea that the array can be changed by others, a getter might help:EDITSince PHP5.4, it is even possible to access array values without the need for intermediate variables, i.e. the following works:If you are using PHP 5.6 or above, use Andrea Faulds answerI am using it like this. I hope, it will help others.config.phpIn file, where I need constants.This is what I use. It is similar to the example provided by soulmerge, but this way you can get the full array or just a single value in the array.Use it like this:You can store it as a JSON string in a constant. And application point of view, JSON can be useful in other cases.I know it\'s a bit old question, but here is my solution:I defined it because I needed to store objects and arrays in constants so I installed also runkit to php so I could make the $const variable superglobal.You can use it as $const->define("my_constant",array("my","values")); or just $const->my_constant = array("my","values");To get the value just simply call $const->my_constant;Using explode and implode function we can improvise a solution :This will echo email.If you want it to optimize it more you can define 2 functions to do the repetitive things for you like this :Hope that helps . Happy coding .Doing some sort of ser/deser or encode/decode trick seems ugly and requires you to remember what exactly you did when you are trying to use the constant.  I think the class private static variable with accessor is a decent solution, but I\'ll do you one better.  Just have a public static getter method that returns the definition of the constant array.  This requires a minimum of extra code and the array definition cannot be accidentally modified.If you want to really make it look like a defined constant you could give it an all caps name, but then it would be confusing to remember to add the \'()\' parentheses after the name.I suppose you could make the method global to be closer to the define() functionality you were asking for, but you really should scope the constant name anyhow and avoid globals.Starting with PHP 5.6, you can define constant arrays using const keyword like belowand different elements can be accessed as below: Starting with PHP 7, constant arrays can be defined using define as below: and different elements can be accessed same way as before. Yes, You can define an array as constant. From PHP 5.6 onwards, it is possible to define a constant as a scalar expression, and it is also possible to define an array constant. It is possible to define constants as a resource, but it should be avoided, as it can cause unexpected results.With the reference of this link Have a happy coding.Constants can only contain scalar values, I suggest you store the serialization (or JSON encoded representation) of the array.I agree with eyze, constants tend to be single value values needed for the entire life of your application. You might think about using a configuration file instead of constants for this sort of thing.If you really need constant arrays, you could use naming conventions to somewhat mimic arrays: for instance DB_Name, DB_USER, DB_HOST, etc.You can define like thisAs of PHP 7, you can just use the define() function to define a constant array :You might also explode the array into a series of constants. (a pretty old school solution) After all, the array is constant, so the only reason you need it for, is global, fast, lookup of certain keys. Hence this:Would turn into:Yes, there\'s namespace pollution (and a lot of prefixing to prevent it) to take into account.That is correct, you cannot use arrays for a constant, only scaler and null. The idea of using an array for constants seem a bit backwards to me.What I suggest to do instead is define your own constant class and use that to get the constant.
