I\'m working on a very basic shopping cart system. I have a table items that has a column price of type integer. I\'m having trouble displaying the price value in my views for prices that include both Euros and cents. Am I missing something obvious as far as handling currency in the Rails framework is concerned?You\'ll probably want to use a DECIMAL type in your database. In your migration, do something like this:In Rails, the :decimal type is returned as BigDecimal, which is great for price calculation.If you insist on using integers, you will have to manually convert to and from BigDecimals everywhere, which will probably just become a pain.As pointed out by mcl, to print the price, use:Here\'s a fine, simple approach that leverages composed_of (part of ActiveRecord, using the ValueObject pattern) and the Money gem You\'ll needWrite this in your product.rb file:What you\'ll get:Common practice for handling currency is to use decimal type.\nHere is a simple example from "Agile Web Development with Rails"This will allow you to handle prices from -999,999.99 to 999,999.99\nYou may also want to include a validation in your items like to sanity-check your values.Use money-rails gem. It nicely handles money and currencies in your model and also has a bunch of helpers to format your prices.Using Virtual Attributes (Link to revised(paid) Railscast) you can store your price_in_cents in an integer column and add a virtual attribute price_in_dollars in your product model as a getter and setter.Source: RailsCasts #016: Virtual Attributes: Virtual attributes are a clean way to add form fields that do not map directly to the database. Here I show how to handle validations, associations, and more.Definitely integers.And even though BigDecimal technically exists 1.5 will still give you a pure Float in Ruby.If someone is using Sequel the migration would look something like: somehow Sequel ignores :precision and :scale(Sequel Version: sequel (3.39.0, 3.38.0))I am using it on this way:Of course that the currency symbol, precision, format and so on depends on each currency.If you are using Postgres (and since we\'re in 2017 now) you might want to give their :money column type a try.You can pass some options to number_to_currency (a standard Rails 4 view helper):As posted by Dylan MarkowMy underlying APIs were all using cents to represent money, and I didn\'t want to change that. Nor was I working with large amounts of money. So I just put this in a helper method:That converts the integer to a string with at least three digits (adding leading zeroes if necessary), then inserts a decimal point before the last two digits, never using a Float. From there you can add whatever currency symbols are appropriate for your use case.It\'s definitely quick and dirty, but sometimes that\'s just fine!Simple code for Ruby & Rails
