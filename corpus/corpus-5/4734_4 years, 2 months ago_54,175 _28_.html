Using Travis-CI, is it possible to trigger a rebuild without pushing a new commit to GitHub?Use case: A build fails due to an externality. The source is actually correct. It would build OK and pass if simply re-run.For instance, an apt-get fails due to a package server being down, but the server is back up again. However the build status is "stuck" at "failed" until a new commit is pushed.Is there some way to nudge Travis-CI to do another build, other than pushing a "dummy" commit?If you have write access to the repo: On the build\'s detail screen, there is a button \xe2\x86\xbb with the tooltip "Restart Build".Note: Browser extensions like Ghostery may prevent the restart button from being displayed. Try disabling the extension or white-listing Travis CI.Note2: If .travis.yml configuration has changed in the upstream, clicking rebuild button will run travis with old configuration. To apply upstream changes for travis configuration one has to add commit to PR or to close / reopen it.If you\'ve sent a pull request: You can close the PR then open it again. This will trigger a new build.If you open the Settings tab for the repository on GitHub, click on Integrations & services, find Travis CI and click Edit, you should see a Test Service button.  This will trigger a build.I know you said without pushing a commit, but something that is handy, if you are working on a branch other than master, is to commit an empty commit.git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger"You can rebase in the end and remove squash/remove the empty commits and works across all git hooks :)Log in to Travis and go to the build page. You will see a "Restart Build" button on the top-right corner, next to the gear icon:Note: you need to have write access to the linked GitHub repo for this to work.If you have new project on GitHub which has .travis.yml, but was never tested, you can run tests without commit this way:If you install the Travis CI Client you can use travis restart <job#> to manually re-run a build from the console. You can find the last job# for a branch using travis show <branch>UPDATE: Sadly it looks like this doesn\'t start a new build using the latest commit, but instead just restarts a previous build using the previous state of the repo.I have found another way of forcing re-run CI builds and other triggers:You can do this using the Travis CLI. As described in the documentation, first install the CLI tool, then:You can keep this token in an environment variable TRAVIS_TOKEN, as long as the file you keep it in is not version-controlled somewhere public.I use this function to submit triggers:If the build never occurred (perhaps you didn\'t get the Pull-Request build switch set to on in time), you can mark the Pull Request on Github as closed then mark it as opened and a new build will be triggered.I just triggered the tests on a pull request to be re-run by clicking \'update branch\' here:\nI should mention here that we now have a means of triggering a new build on the web.
