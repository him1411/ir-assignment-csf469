I am facing the Problem when I have updated my Xcode to 7.0 or iOS 9.0.\nSomehow it started giving me the Titled error"The resource could not be loaded because the App Transport Security\n  policy requires the use of a secure connection"Webservice Method:The service is Running fine for Xcode earlier versions and iOS previous versions But when I have updated to Xcode 7.0 that is on iOS 9.0, it started to give me the Problem like following when I am calling the above web service method. The Logged Error which I am getting is:Connection failed: Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1022 "The\n  resource could not be loaded because the App Transport Security policy\n  requires the use of a secure connection."\n  UserInfo={NSUnderlyingError=0x7fada0f31880 {Error\n  Domain=kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork Code=-1022 "(null)"},\n  NSErrorFailingURLStringKey=MyServiceURL,\n  NSErrorFailingURLKey=MyServiceURL,\n  NSLocalizedDescription=The resource could not be loaded because the\n  App Transport Security policy requires the use of a secure\n  connection.}I have tried Following Questions and answers but did not get any result there, is there any advance idea how I can remove that service call error?I have solved it with adding some key in info.plist.\nThe steps I followed are:Opened my Projects info.plist fileAdded a Key called NSAppTransportSecurity as a Dictionary.Clean the Project and Now Everything is Running fine as like before.Ref Link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32609970EDIT:\nOR In source code of info.plist file we can add that:Be aware, using NSAllowsArbitraryLoads = true allows all connection to any server to be insecure. If you want to make sure only a specific domain is accessible through an insecure connection, try this:Or, as source code:Clean & Build project after editing. For iOS 10.x and Swift 3.x [below versions are also supported] just add the following lines in \'info.plist\'Transport security is provided in iOS 9.0 or later, and in OS X v10.11 and later.So by default only https calls only allowed in apps. To turn off App Transport Security add following lines in info.plist file...For more info:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW33I have solved as plist file.Add a NSAppTransportSecurity : Dictionary.Add Subkey named " NSAllowsArbitraryLoads " as Boolean : YESIn Xcode 7.1 onwards(swift 2.0)From Apple documentationIf you\xe2\x80\x99re developing a new app, you should use HTTPS exclusively. If you have an existing app, you should use HTTPS as much as you can right now, and create a plan for migrating the rest of your app as soon as possible. In addition, your communication through higher-level APIs needs to be encrypted using TLS version 1.2 with forward secrecy. If you try to make a connection that doesn\'t follow this requirement, an error is thrown. If your app needs to make a request to an insecure domain, you have to specify this domain in your app\'s Info.plist file.To Bypass App Transport Security:To allow all insecure domainsRead More: Configuring App Transport Security Exceptions in iOS 9 and OSX 10.11If you are using Xcode 8.0 and swift 3.0 or 2.2iOS 9 (may) force developers to use App Transport Security exclusively. I overheard this somewhere randomly so I don\'t know whether this is true myself. But I suspect it and have come to this conclusion:The app running on iOS 9 will (maybe) no longer connect to a Meteor server without SSL.This means running meteor run ios or meteor run ios-device will (probably?) no longer work.In the app\'s info.plist, NSAppTransportSecurity [Dictionary] needs to have a key NSAllowsArbitraryLoads [Boolean] to be set to YES or Meteor needs to use https for its localhost server soon.You just need to use HTTPS and not HTTP in your URL and it will workI managed to solve this with a combination of many of the mentioned options. I\xe2\x80\x99ll include a checklist of all of the things I had to do to get this to work.In short:Step one:Firstly and most obviously I had to add an NSAppTransportSecurity key as a dictionary in my watch extension\xe2\x80\x99s info.plist with a subkey called NSAllowsArbitraryLoads as a boolean set to true. Only set this in the watch extension and not the watch app\xe2\x80\x99s plist. Although take note that this allows all connections and could be insecure.orStep two:Then I had to make sure that the url I was trying to load was https and not just http. For any urls that were still http I used:Swift:let newURLString = oldURLString.stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString("http", withString: "https")Obj-C:NSString *newURLString = [oldURLString stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@\xe2\x80\x9chttp\xe2\x80\x9d withString:@\xe2\x80\x9chttps\xe2\x80\x9d];I have solved this issue in the case of a self hosted parse-server using a one year signed certificate rather than the option "NSAllowsArbitraryLoads" Parse Server as any node.js server presents a public https url that you have to specify. For instance:parse-server --appId  --masterKey  --publicServerURL https://your.public.url/some_nodejsFeel free to give a look to my configuration files
