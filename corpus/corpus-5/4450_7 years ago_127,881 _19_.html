Sometimes I come across code such as this:Which produces:I\'ve been reading the documentation like crazy but I can\'t find an explanation for the 111. sometimes I see a 212.What does the argument of fig.add_subplot() mean?These are subplot grid parameters encoded as a single integer. For example, "111" means "1x1 grid, first subplot" and "234" means "2x3 grid, 4th subplot".Alternative form for add_subplot(111) is add_subplot(1, 1, 1).I think this would be best explained by the following picture:To initialize the above, one would type:EDIT: Some additional informationThe following combinations produce asymmetrical arrangements of subplots.You can also use the colon operator to specify multiple locations if they are in sequence.Reference hereThe answer from Constantin is spot on but for more background this behavior is inherited from Matlab. The Matlab behavior is explained in the Figure Setup - Displaying Multiple Plots per Figure section of the Matlab documentation.subplot(m,n,i) breaks the figure window into an m-by-n matrix of small\n  subplots and selects the ithe subplot for the current plot. The plots\n  are numbered along the top row of the figure window, then the second\n  row, and so forth.
