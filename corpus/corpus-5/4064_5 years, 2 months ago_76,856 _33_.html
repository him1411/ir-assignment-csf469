What is the difference between invisible and gone for the View visibility status?INVISIBLE:This view is invisible, but it still takes up space for layout purposes.GONE:This view is invisible, and it doesn\'t take any space for layout purposes.From Documentation you can say thatView.GONE This view is invisible, and it doesn\'t take any space for\n  layout purposes.View.INVISIBLE This view is invisible, but it still takes up space for layout purposes.Lets clear the idea with some pictures. Assume that you have three buttons, like below Now if you set visibility of Button Two as invisible (View.INVISIBLE), then output will be And when you set visibility of Button Two as gone (View.GONE) then output will be Hope this will clear your doubts. For ListView or GridView there is an another difference, when visibility initially set toINVISIBLE:Adapter\'s getView() function calledGONE:Adapter\'s getView() function didn\'t call, thus preventing views to load, when it is unnecessaryINVISIBLE:The view has to be drawn and it takes time.GONE:The view doesn\'t have to be drawn.I\'d like to add to the right and successful answers, that if you initialize a view with visibility as View.GONE, the view could have been not initialized and you will get some random errors.For example if you initialize a layout as View.GONE and then you try to start an animation, from my experience I\'ve got my animation working randomly times. Sometimes yes, sometimes no.So before handling (resizing, move, whatever) a view, you have to init it as View.VISIBLE or View.INVISIBLE to render it (draw it) in the screen, and then handle it.View.INVISIBLE->The View is invisible but it will occupy  some space in layoutView.GONE->The View is not visible and it will not occupy any space in layout when you make it Gone every time of compilation of program the component gets initialized that means you are removing the component from layout and when you make it invisible the component it will take the same space in the layout but every time you dont need to initialize it.if you set Visibility=Gone then you have to initialize the component..likeeg Button _mButton = new Button(this);_mButton = (Button)findViewByid(R.id.mButton);so it will take more time as compared to Visibility = invisible.
