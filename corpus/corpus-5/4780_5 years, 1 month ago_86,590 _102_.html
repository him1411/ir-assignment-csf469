When I try to commit changes, I get this error:Any idea how to solve this error ?EDITI tried git fsck I\'ve got:I had a similar problem. My laptop ran out of battery during a git operation. Boo. I didn\'t have any backups. (N.B. Ubuntu One is not a backup solution for git; it will helpfully overwrite your sane repository with your corrupted one.)To the git wizards, if this was a bad way to fix it, please leave a comment. It did, however, work for me... at least temporarily. Step 1: Make a backup of .git (in fact I do this in between every step that changes something, but with a new copy-to name, e.g.  .git-old-1, .git-old-2, etc.): Step 2: Run git fsck --fullStep 3: Remove the empty file. I figured what the heck; its blank anyway. Step 3: Run git fsck again. Continue deleting the empty files. You can also cd into the .git directory and run find . -type f -empty -delete -print to remove all empty files. Eventually git started telling me it was actually doing something with the object directories: Step 4: After deleting all of the empty files, I eventually came to git fsck actually running: Step 5: Try git reflog. Fail because my HEAD is broken. Step 6: Google. Find this. Manually get the last two lines of the reflog: Step 7: Note that from Step 6 we learned that the HEAD is currently pointing to the very last commit. So let\'s try to just look at the parent commit:It worked!Step 8: So now we need to point HEAD to 9f0abf890b113a287e10d56b66dbab66adc1662d. Which didn\'t complain.Step 9: See what fsck says:Step 10: The invalid sha1 pointer in cache-tree seemed like it was from a (now outdated) index file (source). So I killed it and reset the repo.Step 11: Looking at the fsck again...The dangling blobs are not errors. I\'m not concerned with master.u1conflict, and now that it is working I don\'t want to touch it anymore! Step 12: Catching up with my local edits: So hopefully that can be of some use to people in the future. I\'m glad it worked.The git object files have gone corrupt (as pointed out in other answers as well). This can happen during machine crashes, etc.I had the same thing. After reading the other top answers here I found the quickest way to fix the broken git repository with the following commands (execute in the git working directory that contains the .git folder):(Be sure to back up your git repository folder first!)This will first remove any empty object files that cause corruption of the repository as a whole, and then fetch down the missing objects (as well as latest changes) from the remote repository, and then do a full object store check. Which, at this point, should succeed without any errors (there may be still some warnings though!)PS. This answer suggests you have a remote copy of your git repository\n  somewhere (e.g. on GitHub) and the broken repository is the local repository that is tied to the remote repository which is still in tact. If that is not the case, then do not attempt to fix it the way I recommend.I solved this removing the various empty files that git fsck was detecting, and then running a simple git pull.I find it disappointing that now that even filesystems implement journaling and other "transactional" techniques to keep the fs sane, git can get to a corrupted state (and not be able to recover by itself) because of a power failure or space on device.This error happens to me when I am pushing my commit and my computer hangs.\nThis is how I\'ve fix it.show the empty/corrupt object fileremove itI got fatal: bad object HEAD messageI remove the index for the resetfatal: Could not parse object \'HEAD\'.just to check whats happeningprints the last 2 lines tail -n 2 of log branch to show my last 2 commit hashI pick the last commit hashshows all my file as deleted because i removed the .git/index filecontinue to the resetverify my fixNote:    The steps starts when I landed on this question and used the answers as reference.I just had the same issue : after pulling the distant repository, when I did a git status I got :\n"error: object file (...) is empty"\n"fatal: loose object (...) is corrupted"The way I resolved this was to :I dont know exactly what things happened, but that instructions seemed to make everything clean. Because I have to reboot my VM regularly, so somehow this problem happens to me very often. After few times of it, I realized I cannot repeat the process described by @Nathan-Vanhoudnos every time this happens, though it always works. Then I figured out the following faster solution.Step 1Move your entire repo to another folder.Step 2Clone the repo from origin again.Step 3Remove Everything under the new repo except the .git folder.Step 4Move Everything from the temp_repo to the new repo except the .git folder.Step 5Remove the temp_repo, and we are done.After few times, I\'m sure you can do this procedures very quickly.That\'s all. Maybe it is not the best way, but I think it is so practical .Here is a really simple and quick way to deal with this problem IF you have a local repo with all the branches and commits you need, and if you\'re OK with creating a new repo (or deleting the server\'s repo and making a new one in it\'s place):This preserves all the commit history and branches that you had in your local repo.If you have collaborators on the repo, then I think in many cases all your collaborators have to do is change the remote URL of their local repo as well, and optionally push any commits they have that the server doesn\'t have.This solution worked for me when I ran into this same problem. I had one collaborator. After I pushed my local repo to the new remote repo, he simply changed his local repo to point to the remote repo URL and everything worked fine.In my case, this error occurred because I was typing the commit message and my notebook turned off.I did these steps to fix the error:I am assuming you have a remote with all relevant changes already pushed to it. I did not care about local changes and simply wanted to avoid deleting and recloning a large repository. If you do have important local changes you might want to be more careful.I had the same problem after my laptop crashed.\nProbably because it was a large repository I had quite a few corrupt object files, which only appeared one at a time when calling git fsck --full, so I wrote a small shell one-liner to automatically delete one of them:$ sudo rm `git fsck --full 2>&1 | grep -oE -m 1 ".git/objects/[0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]*"` It still only deletes one file at a time, so you might want to call it in a loop like:$ while true; do sudo rm `git fsck --full 2>&1 | grep -oE -m 1 ".git/objects/[0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]*"`; done The problem with this is, that it does not output anything useful anymore so you do not know when it is finished (it should just not do anything useful after some time)To "fix" this I then just added a call of git fsck --full after each round like so:\n$ while true; do sudo rm `git fsck --full 2>&1 | grep -oE -m 1 ".git/objects/[0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]*"`; git fsck --full; doneIt now is approximately half as fast, but it does output it\'s "state".After this I played around some with the suggestions in this thread and finally got to a point where I could git stash and git stash drop a lot of the broken stuff.first problem solvedAfterwards I still had the following problem:\nunable to resolve reference \'refs/remotes/origin/$branch\': reference broken which could be solved by\n$ rm \\repo.git\\refs\\remotes\\origin\\$branch$ git fetchI then did a\n$ git gc --prune=now$ git remote prune originfor good measure andgit reflog expire --stale-fix --allto get rid of error: HEAD: invalid reflog entry $blubb when running git fsck --full.Copy everything (in the folder containing the .git) to a backup, then delete everything and restart. Make sure you have the git remote handy:ThenThen merge any new files manually, and try to keep your computer turned on.Had the same problem after checking out master from a clean branch.\nAfter a while I recognized a lot of modified files in master. I don\'t know why they have been there, after switching from a clean branch. Anyways, because the modified files made no sense to me, I just stashed them and the error was gone.git:(master) git stashThe twelve step solution covered above helped get me out of a jam as well. Thanks. The key steps were to enter: \n  git fsck --full and remove all empty objectsrm .git/objects/...Then getting the two lines of the flog: \n tail -n 2 .git/logs/refs/heads/masterWith the returned valuesgit update-ref HEAD ...At this point I had no more errors, so I made a backup of my most recent files. Then do a git pull followed by a git push. Copied my backups to my git repository file and did another git push. That got me current. if you have an OLD backup and is in a hurry:  make a NEW BACKUP of your current, git-broken, project path.1 - move your .git to trash (never delete)\n2 - copy .git from the OLD backup\n3 - git pull  (will create merge conflicts)\n4 - move all your sources (everything you put in git) to trash: ./src  (never delete)\n5 - .copy all your sources (everything you put in git) from the NEW BACKUP\n6 - accept all "merges" at git gui, push and... clap your hands!  Let\'s go simple.. only case you uploaded source to remote git repo.If you don\'t care about keeping your historical commits, just run rm -r .gitThen answer yes to anything asking about deleting write-protected files.\nProblem solved in under a minute.
