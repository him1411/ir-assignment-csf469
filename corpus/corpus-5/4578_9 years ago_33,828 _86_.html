This question exists because it has\n  historical significance, but it is not\n  considered a good, on-topic question\n  for this site, so please do not use it\n  as evidence that you can ask similar\n   questions here.More info: https://stackoverflow.com/faqThere are always features that would be useful in fringe scenarios, but for that very reason most people don\'t know them. I am asking for features that are not typically taught by the text books.What are the ones that you know?While testing, you can have emails sent to a folder on your computer instead of an SMTP server. Put this in your web.config:If you place a file named app_offline.htm\nin the root of a web application directory, ASP.NET 2.0+ will shut-down the application and stop normal processing any new incoming requests for that application, showing only the contents of the app_offline.htm file for all new requests.This is the quickest and easiest way to display your "Site Temporarily Unavailable" notice while re-deploying (or rolling back) changes to a Production server.Also, as pointed out by marxidad, make sure you have at least 512 bytes of content within the file so IE6 will render it correctly.This will be caught by ASP.NET which will return the customErrors page. Learned about this one in a recent .NET Tip of the Day PostHere\'s the best one. Add this to your web.config for MUCH faster compilation. This is post 3.5SP1 via this QFE.Quick summary: we are introducing a\n  new optimizeCompilations switch in\n  ASP.NET that can greatly improve the\n  compilation speed in some scenarios. \n  There are some catches, so read on for\n  more details.  This switch is\n  currently available as a QFE for\n  3.5SP1, and will be part of VS 2010.The ASP.NET compilation system takes a\n  very conservative approach which\n  causes it to wipe out any previous\n  work that it has done any time a \xe2\x80\x98top\n  level\xe2\x80\x99 file changes. \xe2\x80\x98Top level\xe2\x80\x99 files\n  include anything in bin and App_Code,\n  as well as global.asax. While this\n  works fine for small apps, it becomes\n  nearly unusable for very large apps.\n  E.g. a customer was running into a\n  case where it was taking 10 minutes to\n  refresh a page after making any change\n  to a \xe2\x80\x98bin\xe2\x80\x99 assembly.To ease the pain, we added an\n  \xe2\x80\x98optimized\xe2\x80\x99 compilation mode which\n  takes a much less conservative\n  approach to recompilation.Via here: HttpContext.Current will always give you access to the current context\'s Request/Response/etc., even when you don\'t have access to the Page\'s properties (e.g., from a loosely-coupled helper class).You can continue executing code on the same page after redirecting the user to another one by calling Response.Redirect(url, false )You don\'t need .ASPX files if all you want is a compiled Page (or any IHttpHandler). Just set the path and HTTP methods to point to the class in the <httpHandlers> element in the web.config file.A Page object can be retrieved from an .ASPX file programmatically by calling PageParser.GetCompiledPageInstance(virtualPath,aspxFileName,Context)Retail mode at the machine.config level: Overrides the web.config settings to enforce debug to false, turns custom errors on and disables tracing. No more forgetting to change attributes before publishing - just leave them all configured for development or test environments and update the production retail setting.Enabling intellisense for MasterPages in the content pages \nI am sure this is a very little known hackMost of the time you have to use the findcontrol method and cast the controls in master page from the content pages when you want to use them, the MasterType  directive will enable intellisense in visual studio once you to thisjust add one more directive to the pageIf you do not want to use the Virtual Path and use the class name instead then Get the full article hereHttpContext.Items as a request-level caching toolTwo things stand out in my head:1) You can turn Trace on and off from the code:2) You can build multiple .aspx pages using only one shared "code-behind" file.Build one class .cs file :and then you can have any number of .aspx pages (after you delete .designer.cs and .cs code-behind that VS has generated) : You can have controls in the ASPX that do not appear in Class1, and vice-versa, but you need to remeber to check your controls for nulls.You can use:To get the value of a control BEFORE viewstate is initialized (Control.Text etc will be empty at this point).This is useful for code in Init.WebMethods.You can using ASP.NET AJAX callbacks to web methods placed in ASPX pages. You can decorate a static method with the [WebMethod()] and [ScriptMethod()] attributes. For example:Now, in your ASPX page you can do this:And call your server side method via JavaScript using:Check to see if the client is still connected, before starting a long-running task:One little known and rarely used feature of ASP.NET is:Tag MappingIt\'s rarely used because there\'s only a specific situation where you\'d need it, but when you need it, it\'s so handy.Some articles about this little know feature:Tag Mapping in ASP.NET\nUsing Tag Mapping in ASP.NET 2.0and from that last article:Tag mapping allows you to swap\n  compatible controls at compile time on\n  every page in your web application. A\n  useful example is if you have a stock\n  ASP.NET control, such as a\n  DropDownList, and you want to replace\n  it with a customized control that is\n  derived from DropDownList. This could\n  be a control that has been customized\n  to provide more optimized caching of\n  lookup data. Instead of editing every\n  web form and replacing the built in\n  DropDownLists with your custom\n  version, you can have ASP.NET in\n  effect do it for you by modifying\n  web.config:HttpModules. The architecture is crazy elegant.  Maybe not a hidden feature, but cool none the less.You can use ASP.NET Comments within an .aspx page to comment out full parts of a page including server controls. And the contents that is commented out will never be sent to the client.The Code Expression Builder Sample markup:The real beauty of the code expression builder is that you can use databinding like expressions in non-databinding situations. You can also create other Expression Builders that perform other functions.web.config:The cs class that makes it all happen:Usage of the ASHX file type: \nIf you want to just output some basic html or xml without going through the page event handlers then you can implement the HttpModule in a simple fashionName the page as SomeHandlerPage.ashx and just put the below code (just one line) in itThen the code fileSetting Server Control Properties Based on Target Browser and more.That one kinda took me by surprise.System.Web.VirtualPathUtilityI worked on a asp.net application which went through a security audit by a leading security company and I learned this easy trick to preventing a lesser known but important security vulnerability.The below explanation is from:\nhttp://www.guidanceshare.com/wiki/ASP.NET_2.0_Security_Guidelines_-_Parameter_Manipulation#Consider_Using_Page.ViewStateUserKey_to_Counter_One-Click_AttacksConsider using Page.ViewStateUserKey to counter one-click attacks. If you authenticate your callers and use ViewState, set the Page.ViewStateUserKey property in the Page_Init event handler to prevent one-click attacks.Set the property to a value you know is unique to each user, such as a session ID, user name, or user identifier.A one-click attack occurs when an attacker creates a Web page (.htm or .aspx) that contains a hidden form field named __VIEWSTATE that is already filled with ViewState data. The ViewState can be generated from a page that the attacker had previously created, such as a shopping cart page with 100 items. The attacker lures an unsuspecting user into browsing to the page, and then the attacker causes the page to be sent to the server where the ViewState is valid. The server has no way of knowing that the ViewState originated from the attacker. ViewState validation and HMACs do not counter this attack because the ViewState is valid and the page is executed under the security context of the user.By setting the ViewStateUserKey property, when the attacker browses to a page to create the ViewState, the property is initialized to his or her name. When the legitimate user submits the page to the server, it is initialized with the attacker\'s name. As a result, the ViewState HMAC check fails and an exception is generated. HttpContext.Current.IsDebuggingEnabledThis is great for determining which scripts to output (min or full versions) or anything else you might want in dev, but not live.Included in ASP.NET 3.5 SP1:DefaultButton property in Panels.It sets default button for a particular panel.ScottGu has a bunch of tricks at http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/04/03/441787.aspxUsing configSource to split configuration files.You can use the configSource attribute in a web.config file to push configuration elements to other .config files, for example,\ninstead of:...you can have the entire appSettings section stored in another configuration file. Here\'s the new web.config : The myAppSettings.config file :This is quite useful for scenarios where you deploy an application to a customer and you don\'t want them interfering with the web.config file itself and just want them to be able to change just a few settings.ref: http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/archive/2007/04/26/using-configsource-to-split-configuration-files.aspxMaintainScrollPositionOnPostback attribute in Page directive. It is used to maintain scroll position of aspx page across postbacks.HttpContext.IsCustomErrorEnabled is a cool feature.I\'ve found it useful more than once. Here is a short post about it.By default, any content between tags for a custom control is added as a child control. This can be intercepted in an AddParsedSubObject() override for filtering or additional parsing (e.g., of text content in LiteralControls):...If you have ASP.NET generating an RSS feed, it will sometimes put an extra line at the top of the page.  This won\'t validate with common RSS validators. You can work around it by putting the page directive <@Page> at the bottom of the page.   Before ASP.NET v3.5 added routes you could create your own friendly URLs simply by writing an HTTPModule to and rewrite the request early in the page pipeline (like the BeginRequest event).Urls like http://servername/page/Param1/SomeParams1/Param2/SomeParams2 would get mapped to another page like below (often using regular expressions).DotNetNuke has a really good HttpModule that does this for their friendly urls. Is still useful for machines where you can\'t deploy .NET v3.5.
