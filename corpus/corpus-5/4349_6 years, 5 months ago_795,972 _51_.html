I want to convert a java.util.Date object to a String in Java.The format is 2010-05-30 22:15:52 In Java, Convert a Date to a String using a format string:From http://www.kodejava.org/examples/86.htmlCommons-lang DateFormatUtils is full of goodies (if you have commons-lang in your classpath)2014-11-14 14:05:09The modern way is with the java.time classes that now supplant the troublesome old legacy date-time classes.First convert your java.util.Date to an Instant. The Instant class represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds (up to nine (9) digits of a decimal fraction).Conversions to/from java.time are performed by new methods added to the old classes.Both your java.util.Date and java.time.Instant are in UTC. If you want to see the date and time as UTC, so be it. Call toString to generate a String in standard ISO 8601 format.2014-11-14T14:05:09ZFor other formats, you need to transform your Instant into the more flexible OffsetDateTime.odt.toString(): 2014-11-14T14:05:09+00:00To get a String in your desired format, specify a DateTimeFormatter. You could specify a custom format. But I would use one of the predefined formatters (ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME), and replace the T in its output with a SPACE.2014-11-14 14:05:09By the way I do not recommend this kind of format where you purposely lose the offset-from-UTC or time zone information. Creates ambiguity as to the meaning of that string\xe2\x80\x99s date-time value.Also beware of data loss, as any fractional second is being ignored (effectively truncated) in your String\xe2\x80\x99s representation of the date-time value.To see that same moment through the lens of some particular region\xe2\x80\x99s wall-clock time, apply a ZoneId to get a ZonedDateTime.zdt.toString():  2014-11-14T14:05:09-05:00[America/Montreal]To generate a formatted String, do the same as above but replace odt with zdt.2014-11-14 14:05:09If executing this code a very large number of times, you may want to be a bit more efficient and avoid the call to String::replace. Dropping that call also makes your code shorter. If so desired, specify your own formatting pattern in your own DateTimeFormatter object. Cache this instance as a constant or member for reuse.Apply that formatter by passing the instance.The java.time framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old date-time classes such as java.util.Date, .Calendar, & java.text.SimpleDateFormat.The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration to java.time.To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial. And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations.Much of the java.time functionality is back-ported to Java 6 & 7 in ThreeTen-Backport and further adapted to Android in ThreeTenABP (see How to use\xe2\x80\xa6).The ThreeTen-Extra project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time.Why don\'t you use Joda (org.joda.time.DateTime)?\nIt\'s basically a one-liner.Altenative one-liners in plain-old java:This uses Formatter instead of SimpleDateFormat which is not thread-safe, btw.Slightly more repetitive but needs just one statement. \nThis may be handy in some cases.It looks like you are looking for SimpleDateFormat.Format: yyyy-MM-dd kk:mm:ssThe easiest way to use it is as following:where "yyyy-MM-dd\'T\'HH:mm:ss" is the format of the reading dateoutput: Sun Apr 14 16:11:48 EEST 2013Notes: HH vs hh\n- HH refers to 24h time format\n- hh refers to 12h time formatIf you only need the time from the date, you can just use the feature of String.This will automatically cut the time part of the String and save it inside the timeString.Here are examples of using new Java 8 Time API to format legacy java.util.Date:It is nice about DateTimeFormatter that it can be efficiently cached as it is thread-safe (unlike SimpleDateFormat).List of predefined fomatters and pattern notation reference.Credits:How to parse/format dates with LocalDateTime?
