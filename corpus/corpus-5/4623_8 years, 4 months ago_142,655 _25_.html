I don\'t want a visual merge tool, and I also don\'t want to have to vi the conflicted file and manually choose the between HEAD (mine) and the imported change (theirs).  Most of the time I either want all of their changes or all of mine.  Commonly this is because my change made it upsteam and is coming back to me through a pull, but may be slightly modified in various places.Is there a command line tool which will get rid of the conflict markers and choose all one way or another based on my choice?  Or a set of git commands which I can alias myself to do each one.Doing this is rather annoying.\nFor \'accept mine\' I have tried: How am I supposed to get rid of these change markers?I can do: But this seems rather round about, there must be a better way.  And at this point, I\'m not sure if git even thinks the merge happened, so I don\'t think this necessarily even works.Going the other way, doing \'accept theirs\' is equally messy.\nThe only way I can figure it out is do:This also gives me a messed up commit message, which has Conflicts: Makefile in it twice.Can someone please point out how to do the above two actions in a simpler way?  ThanksThe solution is very simple. git checkout <filename> tries to check out file from the index, and therefore fails on merge. What you need to do is (i.e. checkout a commit):To checkout your own version you can use one of: ororTo checkout the other version you can use one of: ororYou would also need to run \'add\' to mark it as resolved:Based on Jakub\'s answer you can configure the following git aliases for convenience:They optionally take one or several paths of files to resolve and default to resolving everything under the current directory if none are given.Add them to the [alias] section of your ~/.gitconfig or runTry this:To accept theirs changes: git merge --strategy-option theirs To accept yours: git merge --strategy-option oursBased on kynan\'s answer, here are the same aliases, modified so they can handle spaces and initial dashes in filenames:
