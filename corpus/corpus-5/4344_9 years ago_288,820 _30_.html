I\'m attracted to the neatness that a single file database provides. What driver/connector library is out there to connect and use SQLite with Java.I\'ve discovered a wrapper library, http://www.ch-werner.de/javasqlite, but are there other more prominent projects available?The wiki lists some more wrappers:I found your question while searching for information with SQLite and Java. Just thought I\'d add my answer which I also posted on my blog.I have been coding in Java for a while now. I have also known about SQLite but never used it\xe2\x80\xa6 Well I have used it through other applications but never in an app that I coded. So I needed it for a project this week and it\'s so simple use!I found a Java JDBC driver for SQLite. Just add the JAR file to your classpath and import java.sql.*His test app will create a database file, send some SQL commands to create a table, store some data in the table, and read it back and display on console. It will create the test.db file in the root directory of the project.  You can run this example with java -cp .:sqlitejdbc-v056.jar Test.I understand you asked specifically about SQLite, but maybe HSQL database would be a better fit with Java. It is written in Java itself, runs in the JVM, supports in-memory tables etc. and all that features make it quite usable for prototyping and unit-testing.There is a new project SQLJet that is a pure Java implementation of SQLite. It doesn\'t support all of the SQLite features yet, but may be a very good option for some of the Java projects that work with SQLite databases.David Crawshaw project(sqlitejdbc-v056.jar) seems out of date and last update was Jun 20, 2009,  source hereI would recomend Xerials fork of Crawshaw sqlite wrapper.  I replaced sqlitejdbc-v056.jar  with Xerials sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar file without any problem. Uses same syntax as in Bernie\'s answer and is much faster and with latest sqlite library.What is different from Zentus\'s SQLite JDBC?The original Zentus\'s SQLite JDBC driver\n  http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/ itself is an excellent utility for\n  using SQLite databases from Java language, and our SQLiteJDBC library\n  also relies on its implementation. However, its pure-java version,\n  which totally translates c/c++ codes of SQLite into Java, is\n  significantly slower compared to its native version, which uses SQLite\n  binaries compiled for each OS (win, mac, linux).To use the native version of sqlite-jdbc, user had to set a path to\n  the native codes (dll, jnilib, so files, which are JNDI C programs) by\n  using command-line arguments, e.g., -Djava.library.path=(path to the\n  dll, jnilib, etc.), or -Dorg.sqlite.lib.path, etc. This process was\n  error-prone and bothersome to tell every user to set these variables.\n  Our SQLiteJDBC library completely does away these inconveniences.Another difference is that we are keeping this SQLiteJDBC libray\n  up-to-date to the newest version of SQLite engine, because we are one\n  of the hottest users of this library. For example, SQLite JDBC is a\n  core component of UTGB (University of Tokyo Genome Browser) Toolkit,\n  which is our utility to create personalized genome browsers.EDIT : As usual when you update something, there will be problems in some obscure place in your code(happened to me). Test test test =)Bernie\'s post is very helpful. Couldn\'t vote up (don\'t have enough reputation :( ). But it Helped a lot. Just to reiterate!http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/Here you can find the latest SQLite JDBC jar. Just add the jar into you classpath and you are done! :) You can run Bernie\'s sample code to test if everything is fine. http://souptonuts.sourceforge.net/readme_sqlite_tutorial.html\nhttp://www.sqlite.org/lang.htmlHere you can find some help on SQL syntax for SQLite.\nCheers to SQLite :)When you compile and run the code, you should set the classpath options value.\nJust like the following:Please pay attention to "." and the sparate ";"(win, the linux is ":")sqlitejdbc code can be downloaded using git from https://github.com/crawshaw/sqlitejdbc. Note: Makefile requires curl binary to download sqlite libraries/deps.The example code leads to a memory leak in Tomcat (after undeploying the webapp, the classloader still remains in memory) which will cause an outofmemory eventually. The way to solve it is to use the sqlite-jdbc-3.7.8.jar; it\'s a snapshot, so it doesn\'t appear for maven yet.Typo: java -cp .:sqlitejdbc-v056.jar Testshould be: java -cp .:sqlitejdbc-v056.jar; Testnotice the semicolon after ".jar" i hope that helps people, could cause a lot of hassle
