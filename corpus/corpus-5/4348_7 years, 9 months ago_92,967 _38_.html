We use tags in git as part of our deployment process.  From time to time, we want to clean up these tags by removing them from our remote repository.This is pretty straightforward.  One user deletes the local tag and the remote tag in one set of commands.  We have a little shell script that combines both steps.The 2nd (3rd, 4th,...) user now has local tags that are no longer reflected on the remote.  I am looking for a command similar to git remote prune origin which cleans up locally tracking branches for which the remote branch has been deleted.Alternatively, a simple command to list remote tags could be used to compare to the local tags returned via git tag -l.Good question.  :)  I don\'t have a complete answer...That said, you can get a list of remote tags via git ls-remote.  To list the tags in the repository referenced by origin, you\'d run:That returns a list of hashes and friendly tag names, like:You could certainly put together a bash script to compare the tags generated by this list with the tags you have locally.  Take a look at git show-ref --tags, which generates the tag names in the same form as git ls-remote).As an aside, git show-ref has an option that does the opposite of what you\'d like.  The following command would list all the tags on the remote branch that you don\'t have locally:This is great question, I\'d been wondering the same thing.I didn\'t want to write a script so sought a different solution.  The key is discovering that you can delete a tag locally, then use git fetch to "get it back" from the remote server.  If the tag doesn\'t exist on the remote, then it will remain deleted.Thus you need to type two lines in order:These:Delete all tags from the local repo.  FWIW, xargs places each tag output by "tag -l" onto the command line for "tag -d".  Without this, git won\'t delete anything because it doesn\'t read stdin (silly git).Fetch all active tags from the remote repo.This even works a treat on Windows.From Git v1.7.8 to v1.8.5.6, you can use this:This doesn\'t work on newer versions of git (starting with v1.9.0) because of commit e66ef7ae6f31f2. I don\'t really want to delete it though since it did work for some people.As suggested by "Chad Juliano", with all Git version since v1.7.8, you can use the following command:You may need to enclose the tags part with quotes (on Windows for example) to avoid wildcard expansion:If you only want those tags which exist on the remote, delete all your local tags:And then fetch all the remote tags:All versions of Git since v1.7.8 understand git fetch with a refspec, whereas since v1.9.0 the --tags option overrides the --prune option. For a general purpose solution, try this:For further reading on how the "--tags" with "--prune" behavior changed in Git v1.9.0, see: https://github.com/git/git/commit/e66ef7ae6f31f246dead62f574cc2acb75fd001cJust added a git sync-local-tags command to pivotal_git_scripts Gem fork on GitHub:https://github.com/kigster/git_scriptsInstall the gem, then run "git sync-local-tags" in your repository to delete the local tags that do not exist on the remote.  Alternatively you can just install this script below and call it "git-sync-local-tags":Show the difference between local and remote tags:The lines starting with "< " are your local tags that are no longer in the remote repo. If they are few, you can remove them manually one by one, if they are many, you do more grep-ing and piping to automate it.How about this - drop all local tags and then re-fetch?\nConsidering your repo might contain submodules:TortoiseGit can compare tags now.Left log is on remote, right is at local.Using the Compare tags feature of Sync dialog:Also see TortoiseGit issue 2973
