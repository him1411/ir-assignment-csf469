What is the size of column of int(11) in mysql in bytes?And Maximum value that can be stored in this columns?An INT will always be 4 bytes no matter what length is specified.The length just specifies how many characters to display when selecting data with the mysql command line client.... and the maximum value will be 2147483647 (Signed) or 4294967295 (Unsigned)According to here, int(11) will take 4 bytes of space that is 32 bits of space with  2^(31) = 2147483648 max value and -2147483648min value. One bit is for sign.INT(somenumber) will make difference only in term of display, that is to show in the number in \'somenumber\' digits, and not restricted only to 11. But the value stored in database is not affected.Note that :if the value has less digit than \'somenumber\', you need to use ZEROFILL attribute to take effect, otherwise there is no difference at all.  INT(5) ZEROFILL with the stored value of 32 will show 00032\n  INT(5) with the stored value of 32 will show 32\n  INT with the stored value of 32 will show 32if the value has more digit than \'somenumber\', then the stored value will be shown.  INT(3) with the stored value of 250000 will show 250000What is the size of column of int(11) in mysql in bytes?  (11) - this attribute of int data type has nothing to do with size of column. It is just display width of integer data type. From 11.1.4.5. Numeric Type Attributes:  MySQL supports an extension for optionally specifying the display\n  width of integer data types in parentheses following the base keyword\n  for the type. For example, INT(4) specifies an INT with a display\n  width of four digits.As others have said, the minumum/maximum values the column can store and how much storage it takes in bytes is only defined by the type, not the length. A lot of these answers are saying that the (11) part only affects the display width which isn\'t exactly true, but mostly.A definition of int(2) with no zerofill specified will:The only thing the (2) will do is if zerofill is also specified:The best way to see all the nuances is to run:which will output:Notice how int1 column has a much smaller display width than zerofill2 even though the length is larger.This answer is tested against MySQL 5.7.12 for Linux and may or may not vary for other implementations.A good explanation for this can be found here\nTo summarize : The number in the bracket in int(N) is often confused by the maximum size allowed for the column, as it does in the case of varchar(N).  But this is not the case with Integer data types- the number N in the bracket is not the maximum size for the column, but simply a parameter to tell MySQL what width to display the column at when the table\'s data is being viewed via the MySQL console (when you\'re using the ZEROFILL attribute).\n\nThe number in brackets will tell MySQL how many zeros to pad incoming integers with. For example: If you\'re using ZEROFILL on a column that is set to INT(5) and the number 78 is inserted, MySQL will pad that value with zeros until the number satisfies the number in brackets. i.e. 78 will become 00078 and 127 will become 00127. To sum it up: The number in brackets is used for display purposes.\nIn a way, the number in brackets is kind of usless unless you\'re using the ZEROFILL attribute.\nSo the size for int would remain same i.e., -2147483648 to 2147483648 for signed and  0 to 4294967295 for unsigned (~ 2.15 billions and 4.2 billions, one of the reasons why developers remain unaware of the story behind the Number N in brackets, as it hardly affects the database unless it contains over 2 billions of rows), and in terms of bytes it would be 4 bytes.For more information on Integer Types size/range, refer MySQL ManualThough this answer is unlikely to be seen, I think the following clarification is worth making: A BIT OF DETAIL\nthe display width is, apparently, intended to provide some metadata about how many zeros to display in a zero filled number.\nIt does NOT actually limit the length of a number returned from a query if that number goes above the display width specified.\nTo know what length/width is actually allowed for an integer data type in MySQL see the list & link: (types: TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT, BIGINT);\nSo having said the above, you can expect the display width to have no affect on the results from a standard query, unless the columns are specified as ZEROFILL columns \nOR \nin the case the data is being pulled into an application & that application is collecting the display width to use for some other sort of padding.Primary Reference: https://blogs.oracle.com/jsmyth/entry/what_does_the_11_meanIn MySQL integer int(11) has size is 4 bytes which equals 32 bit.Signed value is : -2^(32-1) to 0 to 2^(32-1)-1\n            =    -2147483648 to 0 to 2147483647Unsigned values is : 0 to 2^32-1\n                  =  0 to 4294967295I think max value of int(11) is 42949672954294967295 is the answer, because int(11) shows maximum of 11 digits IMO
