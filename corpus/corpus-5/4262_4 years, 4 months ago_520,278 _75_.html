Sometimes I use anchors styled as buttons and sometimes I just use buttons. I want to disable specific clicky-things so that:How can I do this?Buttons are simple to disable as disabled is a button property which is handled by the browser:To disable these with a custom jQuery function, you\'d simply make use of fn.extend():JSFiddle disabled button and input demo.Otherwise you\'d make use of jQuery\'s prop() method:It\'s worth noting that disabled isn\'t a valid property for anchor tags. For this reason, Bootstrap uses the following styling on its .btn elements:Note how the [disabled] property is targeted as well as a .disabled class. The .disabled class is what is needed to make an anchor tag appear disabled.Of course, this will not prevent links from functioning when clicked. The above link will take us to http://example.com. To prevent this, we can add in a simple piece of jQuery code to target anchor tags with the disabled class to call event.preventDefault():We can toggle the disabled class by using toggleClass():JSFiddle disabled link demo.We can then extend the previous disable function made above to check the type of element we\'re attempting to disable using is(). This way we can toggleClass() if it isn\'t an input or button element, or toggle the disabled property if it is:Full combined JSFiddle demo.It\'s worth further noting that the above function will also work on all input types.I can\'t think a simpler/easier way! ;-)For Anchor Tags(Links) :To enable the Anchor tag:To disable the Anchor tag:Suppose you have text field and submit button,To disable any button, for example, submit button you just need to add disabled attribute as,After executing above line, your submit button html tag would look like this:Notice the \'disabled\' attribute has added.For enabling button, such as when you have some text in text field. You will need to remove the disable attribute to enable button as,Now the above code will remove the \'disabled\' attribute.I know I\'m late to the party, but to specifically answer the two questions:"I just want to disable specific clicky-things so that:How hard can this be?"They stop clicking1.  For buttons like <button> or <input type="button"> you add the attribute: disabled.2.  For links, ANY link... actually, any HTML element, you can use CSS3 pointer events.Browser support for pointer events is awesome by today\'s state of the art (5/12/14). But we usually have to support legacy browsers in the IE realm, so IE10 and below DO NOT support pointer events: http://caniuse.com/pointer-events. So using one of the JavaScript solutions mentioned by others here may be the way to go for legacy browsers.More info about pointer events:They look disabledObviously this a CSS answer, so: 1.  For buttons like <button> or <input type="button"> use the [attribute] selector:--Here\'s a basic demo with the stuff I mentioned here: http://jsfiddle.net/bXm5B/4/Hope this helps.If, like me, you just want to disable a button, don\'t miss the simple answer subtly hidden in this long thread:@James Donnelly has supplied a comprehensive answer that relies on extending jQuery with a new function. That is a great idea, so I am going to adapt his code so it works the way I need it to.Extending jQueryUsageThe code will process a single element or a list of elements.Buttons and Inputs support the disabled property and, if set to true, they will look disabled (thanks to bootstrap) and will not fire when clicked. Anchors don\'t support the disabled property so instead we are going to rely on the .disabled class to make them look disabled (thanks to bootstrap again) and hook up a default click event that prevents the click by returning false (no need for preventDefault see here). Note: You do not need to unhook this event when re-enabling anchors. Simply removing the .disabled class does the trick. Of course, this does not help if you have attached a custom click handler to the link, something that is very common when using bootstrap and jQuery. So to deal with this we are going tro use the isDisabled() extension to test for the .disabled class, like this:I hope that helps simplify things a bit.Great answer and contributions from all! I had to extend this function slightly to include disabling of select elements:Seems to be working for me. Thanks all!For that kind of behavior I always use the jQueryUI button widget, I use it for links and buttons.Define the tag within HTML:Use jQuery to initialize the buttons:Use the button widget methods to disable/enable them:That will take care of the button and cursor behavior, but if you need to get deeper and change the button style when disabled then overwrite the following CSS classes within your page CSS style file.But remember: those CSS classes (if changed) will change the style for other widgets too.Note that there\'s a weird problem if you\'re using Bootstrap\'s JS buttons and the \'loading\' state. I don\'t know why this happens, but here\'s how to fix it.Say you have a button and you set it to the loading state:Now you want to take it out of the loading state, but also disable it (e.g. the button was a Save button, the loading state indicated an ongoing validation and the validation failed). This looks like reasonable Bootstrap JS:Unfortunately, that will reset the button, but not disable it. Apparently, button() performs some delayed task. So you\'ll also have to postpone your disabling:A bit annoying, but it\'s a pattern I\'m using a lot.This is a rather late answer, however I stumbled upon this question while searching for a way to disable boostrap buttons after clicking them and maybe add a nice effect (f.e a spinner). I\'ve found a great library that does exactly that:http://msurguy.github.io/ladda-bootstrap/You just include the required css and js, add some properties to your buttons and enable lada with javascript... Presto ! Your buttons have a new life (please check the demo to see how beautiful it is) !This above does not work because sometimes adjust your code withI know my answer is late, but IMO this is the easiest way to toggle a Button \'enable\' and button \'disable\'The following has worked for me very well:Suppose you have these buttons on page like :The js code:Say you have that looks like this that is currently enable.Just add this:and you will get this which will disable button
