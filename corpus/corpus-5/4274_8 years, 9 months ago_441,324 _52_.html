Is there some easy way to pad Strings in Java?Seems like something that should be in some StringUtil-like API, but I can\'t find anything that does this.Apache StringUtils has several methods: leftPad, rightPad, center and repeat. Edit: As others have mentioned and demonstrated in this answer, String.format() and the Formatter classes in the JDK are better options. Use them over the commons code.Since Java 1.5, String.format() can be used to left/right pad a given string.Padding to 10 characters:output:Display \'*\' for characters of password:output has the same length as the password string:In Guava, this is easy:Something simple:The value should be a string. convert it to string, if it\'s not. Like "" + 123 or Integer.toString(123)Substring start from the value length char index until end length of padded:More precise pad right:pad left:Have a look at org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils#rightPad(String str, int size, char padChar).But the algorithm is very simple (pad right up to size chars):Besides Apache Commons, also see String.format which should be able to take care of simple padding (e.g. with spaces).This took me a little while to figure out.\nThe real key is to read that Formatter documentation.i know this thread is kind of old and the original question was for an easy solution but if it\'s supposed to be really fast, you should use a char array.the formatter solution is not optimal. just building the format string creates 2 new strings.apache\'s solution can be improved by initializing the sb with the target size so replacing belowwith    would prevent the sb\'s internal buffer from growing.Here is another way to pad to the right:You can reduce the per-call overhead by retaining the padding data, rather than rebuilding it every time:As an alternative, you can make the result length a parameter to the pad(...) method. In that case do the adjustment of the hidden padding in that method instead of in the constructor.(Hint: For extra credit, make it thread-safe! ;-)This works:It will fill your String XXX up to 9 Chars with a whitespace. After that all Whitespaces will be replaced with a 0. You can change the whitespace and the 0 to whatever you want...Let\'s me leave an answer for some cases that you need to give left/right padding (or prefix/suffix string or spaces) before you concatenate to another string and you don\'t want to test length or any if condition.The same to the selected answer, I would prefer the StringUtils of Apache Commons but using this way:Explain:java.util.Formatter will do left and right padding. No need for odd third party dependencies (would you want to add them for something so trivial).[I\'ve left out the details and made this post \'community wiki\' as it is not something I have a need for.]you can use the built in StringBuilder append() and insert() methods,\nfor padding of variable string lengths:For Example:@ck\'s and @Marlon Tarak\'s answers are the only ones to use a char[], which for applications that have several calls to padding methods per second is the best approach.  However, they don\'t take advantage of any array manipulation optimizations and are a little overwritten for my taste; this can be done with no loops at all.Simple test method:Outputs:A lot of people have some very interesting techniques but I like to keep it simple so I go with this : A simple solution without any API will be as follows:Java oneliners, no fancy library. Pad Left, don\'t limitPad Right, don\'t limitPad Left, limit to pad lengthPad Right, limit to pad lengthAll string operation usually needs to be very efficient - especially if you are working with big sets of data. I wanted something that\'s fast and flexible, similar to what you will get in plsql pad command. Also, I don\'t want to include a huge lib for just one small thing. With these considerations none of these solutions were satisfactory. This is the solutions I came up with, that had the best bench-marking results, if anybody can improve on it, please add your comment.A simple solution would be:How is thisString is "hello" and required padding is 15 with "0" left pad
