I\'m using the scrollTo jQuery plugin and would like to know if it is somehow possible to temporarily disable scrolling on the window element through Javascript? The reason I\'d like to disable scrolling is that when you scroll while scrollTo is animating, it gets really ugly ;)Of course, I could do a $("body").css("overflow", "hidden"); and then put it back to auto when the animation stops, but it would be better if the scrollbar was still visible but inactive.The scroll event cannot be canceled. But you can do it by canceling these interaction events:\nMouse & Touch scroll and Buttons associated with scrolling.Do it simply by adding a class to the body:Add the class then remove when you want to re-enable scrolling, tested in IE, FF, Safari and Chrome.  For mobile devices, you\'ll need to handle the touchmove event:And unbind to re-enable scrolling. Tested in iOS6 and Android 2.3.3Here\'s a really basic way to do it:It\'s kind of jumpy in IE6.This solution will maintain the current scroll position whilst scrolling is disabled, unlike some which jump the user back to the top.It\'s based on galambalazs\' answer, but with support for touch devices, and refactored as a single object with jquery plugin wrapper.Demo here. On github here.The following solution is basic but pure JavaScript (no jQuery):I\'m sorry to answer an old post but I was looking for a solution and came across this question.There are many workarounds for this issue to still display the scrollbar, like giving the container a 100% height and an overflow-y: scroll styling.In my case I just created a div with a scrollbar which I display while adding overflow: hidden to the body:The element scrollbar must have this styles:This shows a grey scrollbar, hope it helps future visitors.According to the galambalazs post I would add support for touch devices, allowing us to touch but no scroll up or down:I was looking out for a solution to this problem but was not satisfied with the any of the above solutions (as of writing this answer), so I came up with this solution..CSSJSHow about this? (If you\'re using jQuery)I\'m using showModalDialog, for showing secondary page as modal dialog.to hide main window scrollbars:and when closing modal dialog, showing main window scrollbars:to access elements in main window from dialog:just for anybody searching about showModalDialog:(after line 29 of original code)Another solution:This way you always have a vertical scrollbar, but as most of my content is longer than the viewport, this is ok for me. Content is centered with a separate div, but without setting margin again in body my content would stay at the left.These are the two function I use to show my popup/modal:Result: non scrollable background and no re-positioning of the content because of the left scrollbar. Tested with current FF, Chrome and IE 10.Depending on what you want to achieve with the removed scroll you could just fix the element that you want to remove scroll from (on click, or whatever other trigger you\'d like to temporarily deactivate scroll)I was searching around for a "temp no scroll" solution and for my needs, this solved itmake a classthen with JqueryI found that this was a simple enough solution that works well on all browsers, and also makes for simple use on portable devices (i.e. iPhones, tablets etc). Since the element is temporarily fixed, there is no scroll  :)NOTE! Depending on the placement of your "contentContainer" element you might need to adjust it from the left. Which can easily be done by adding a css left value to that element when the fixed class is activeCancelling the event\'s as in the accepted answer is a horrible method in my opinion :/Instead I used position: fixed; top: -scrollTop(); below.Demo: https://jsfiddle.net/w9w9hthy/5/From my jQuery popup project: https://github.com/seahorsepip/jPopupThis code takes, width, height, scrollbar and pagejump issues into consideration.Possible issues resolved with above code:If anyone has any improvements to above page freeze/unfreeze code let me know so I can add those improvements to my project.I know this is an old question, but I had to do something very similar, and after some time looking for an answer and trying different approaches, I ended up using a very easy solution.My problem was very similar, almost identical, the only difference is I didn\'t have to actually show the scroll bar - I just had to make sure its width would still be used, so the page\'s width would not change while my overlay was displayed.When I start sliding my overlay into the screen, I do:and after I slide my overlay off the screen I do:IMPORTANT: this works perfectly because my overlay is positioned absolute, right: 0px when visible.Building on Cheyenne Forbes\' answer, and one I found here via fcalderan: Just disable scroll not hide it?\nand to fix Hallodom\'s issue of the scrollbar disappearingCSS:JS:This code does jump you to the top of the page, but I think that fcalderan\'s code has a workaround.I found this answer on another site:Disable scroll:After close popup release scroll:galambalazs\'s solution is great! It worked perfectly for me in both Chrome and Firefox. And it also may be extended to prevent any default event from the browser window.\nLet\'s say you are doing an app on the canvas. You could do this:And then on your app let\'s say you\'re going to process your own events, like mouse, keyboard, touch events and so on... You could disable default events when the mouse goes inside the canvas and re-enable them when the mouse goes out:You could even disable right click menu with this hack:I had a similar animation problem on mobile screens but not on laptops, when trying to animate a div using jquery\'s animate command. So I decided to use a timer that restored the window\'s scroll position so frequently  that to a naked eye the document would appear static. This solution  worked perfectly on a small screen mobile device like Samsung Galaxy-2 or iphone-5. Main Logic of this approach: The timer to set window\'s scroll position to original scroll position should be started before the jquery animate command, and then when animation is completed we need to clear this timer (original scroll position is the position just before animation starts).I found to my pleasant surprise that the document actually appeared static during the animation duration if the timer interval was 1 millisecond, which is what I was aiming for. ANOTHER SOLUTION that worked: Based on the answer by Mohammad Anini under this post to enable/disable scrolling, I also found that a modified version of code as below worked.A simple solution that worked for me (disabling window scrolling temporarily).Based on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/dh834zgw/1/the following snippet (using jquery) will disable the window scroll:And in your css:Now when you remove the modal, don\'t forget to remove the noscroll class on the html tag:Something I\'ve just put together:jsfiddleYou can block the spacebar scroll and hide the browser scrollbar:My take on this issue also includes a concern with the body width, as the page seems to dance a little when we hide the scroll bar with overflow = "hidden".\nThe following code works perfectly for me, and is based on an Angular approach.I found a better, but buggy way, combining sdleihssirhc\'s idea:I didn\'t test it, but I\'ll edit later and let you all know. I\'m 85% sure it works on major browsers.Enabling the following CSS with JavaScript will help. I\'m not as good as the others here but this worked for me.
