I\'m new to REST and I\'ve observed that in some RESTful services they use different resource URI for update/get/delete and Create. Such asI\'m little bit confused about this URI naming convention. What should we use plural or singular for resource creation? What should be the criteria while deciding that?The premise of using /resources is that it is representing "all" resources. If you do a GET /resources, you will likely return the entire collection. By POSTing to /resources, you are adding to the collection.However, the individual resources are available at /resource. If you do a GET /resource, you will likely error, as this request doesn\'t make any sense, whereas /resource/123 makes perfect sense.Using /resource instead of /resources is similar to how you would do this if you were working with, say, a file system and a collection of files and /resource is the "directory" with the individual 123, 456 files in it.Neither way is right or wrong, go with what you like best.For me is better to have a schema that you can map directly to code (easy to automate), mainly because code is what is going to be at both ends.  I don\'t see the point in doing this either and I think it is not the best URI design. As a user of a RESTful service I\'d expect the list resource to have the same name no matter whether I access the list or specific resource \'in\' the list. You should use the same identifiers no matter whether you want use the list resource or a specific resource.Whereas the most prevalent practice are RESTful apis where plurals are used e.g. /api/resources/123 , there is one special case where I find use of a singular name more appropriate/expressive than plural names. It is the case of one-to-one relationships. Specifically if the target item is a value object(in Domain-driven-design paradigm).Let us assume every resource has a one-to-one accessLog which could be modeled as a value object i.e not an entity therefore no ID. It could be expressed as /api/resources/123/accessLog. The usual verbs (POST, PUT, DELETE, GET) would appropriately express the intent and also the fact that the relationship is indeed one-to-one.Pluralization of resource names in REST URIs is the widely adopted standard followed by the overwhelming majority of public and private APIs.Beyond being "the standard approach" it also makes sense and is the most simple.For example:GET    /resources - returns a list of resource itemsPOST   /resources - creates one or many resource itemsPUT    /resources - updates one or many resource itemsPATCH  /resources - partially updates one or many resource items DELETE /resources - deletes all resource itemsAnd for single resource items:GET    /resources/:id - returns a specific resource item based on :id parameterPOST   /resources/:id - creates one resource item with specified id (requires validation)PUT    /resources/:id - updates a specific resource itemPATCH  /resources/:id - partially updates a specific resource itemDELETE /resources/:id - deletes a specific resource itemConvenience \nThings can have irregular plural names. Sometimes they don\'t have one.\nBut Singular names are always there.e.g. CustomerAddress over CustomerAddressesConsider this related resource.This /order/12/orderdetail/12 is more readable and logical than /orders/12/orderdetails/4 .A resource represents a entity like a database table. \nIt should have a logical singular name.\nHere\'s the answer over table names.Classes are always singular. ORM tools generate tables with same names as class names. As more and more tools are being used, singular names are becoming a standard.Read more about a REST API Developer\'s Dilemma Why not follow the prevalent trend of database table names, where a singular form is generally accepted? Been there, done that -- let\'s reuse.Table Naming Dilemma: Singular vs. Plural NamesFrom the API consumer\'s perspective, the endpoints should be predictable soIdeally...This approach is the most flexible and feature rich, but also the most time consuming to develop. So, if you\'re in a hurry (which is always the case with software development) just name your endpoint resource or the plural form resources. I prefer the singular form because it gives you the option to introspect and evaluate programmatically since not all plural forms end in \'s\'.Having said all that, for whatever reason the most commonly used practice developer\'s have chosen is to use the plural form. This is ultimately the route I have chosen and if you look at popular apis like github and twitter, this is what they do. Some criteria for deciding could be:So it\'s up to you. Just whatever you do be consistent.My two cents: methods who spend their time changing from plural to singular or viceversa are a waste of CPU cycles. I may be old-school, but in my time like things were called the same. How do I look up methods concerning people? No regular expresion will cover both person and people without undesirable side effects.English plurals can be very arbitrary and they encumber the code needlessly. Stick to one naming convention. Computer languages were supposed to be about mathematical clarity, not about mimicking natural language.With naming conventions, it\'s usually safe to say "just pick one and stick to it", which makes sense.However, after having to explain REST to lots of people, representing endpoints as paths on a file system is the most expressive way of doing it.\nIt is stateless (files either exist or don\'t exist), hierarchical, simple, and familiar - you already knows how to access static files, whether locally or via http.And within that context, linguistic rules can only get you as far as the following:A directory can contain multiple files and/or sub-directories, and therefore its name should be in plural form.And I like that.\nAlthough, on the other hand - it\'s your directory, you can name it "a-resource-or-multiple-resources" if that\'s what you want. That\'s not really the important thing.What\'s important is that if you put a file named "123" under a directory named "resourceS" (resulting in /resourceS/123), you cannot then expect it to be accessible via /resource/123.Don\'t try to make it smarter than it has to be - changing from plural to singluar depending on the count of resources you\'re currently accessing may be aesthetically pleasing to some, but it\'s not effective and it doesn\'t make sense in a hierarchical system.Note: Technically, you can make "symbolic links", so that /resources/123 can also be accessed via /resource/123, but the former still has to exist!I prefer using singular form for both simplicity and consistency.For example, considering the following url:/customer/1I will treat customer as customer collection, but for simplicity, the collection part is removed.Another example:/equipment/1In this case, equipments is not the correct plural form. So treating it as a equipment collection and removing collection for simplicity makes it consistent with the customer case.I am surprised to see that so many people would jump on the plural noun bandwagon. When implementing singular to plural conversions, are you taking care of irregular plural nouns? Do you enjoy pain?See\nhttp://web2.uvcs.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/330/grammar/irrplu.htmThere are many types of irregular plural, but these are the most common:Noun type   Forming the plural  ExampleEnds with -fe   Change f to v\nthen\nAdd -s  knife   knives\nlife   lives\nwife   wives\nEnds with -f    Change f to v\nthen\nAdd -es half   halves\nwolf   wolves\nloaf   loaves\nEnds with -o    Add -es potato   potatoes\ntomato   tomatoes\nvolcano   volcanoes\nends with -us   Change -us to -i    cactus   cacti\nnucleus   nuclei\nfocus   foci\nends with -is   Change -is to -es   analysis   analyses\ncrisis   crises\nthesis   theses\nends with -on   Change -on to -a    phenomenon   phenomena\ncriterion   criteria\nALL KINDS   Change the vowel\nor\nChange the word\nor\nAdd a different ending  man   men\nfoot   feet\nchild   children\nperson   people\ntooth   teeth\nmouse   mice\nUnchanging  Singular and plural\nare the same    sheep\ndeer\nfish (sometimes)Using plural for all methods is more practical at least in one aspect: \nif you\'re developing and testing a resource API using Postman (or similar tool), you don\'t need to edit the URI when switching from GET to PUT to POST etc.To me plurals manipulate the collection, whereas singulars manipulate the item inside that collection.Collection allows the methods GET / POST / DELETEItem allows the methods GET / PUT / DELETEFor exampleDELETE on /cart_items will clear all the items in the cart. DELETE on /cart_item/123 will remove 123 from the cart.It might feel like unimportant but some engineers sometimes forget the id.  If the route was always plural and performed a DELETE, you might accidentally wipe your data. Whereas missing the id on the singular will return a 404 route not found.Both representations are useful. I had used singular for convenience for quite some time, inflection can be difficult. My experience in developing strictly singular REST APIs, the developers consuming the endpoint lack certainty in what the shape of the result may be. I now prefer to use the term that best describes the shape of the response.If all of your resources are top level, then you can get away with singular representations. Avoiding inflection is a big win.If you are doing any sort of deep linking to represent queries on relations, then developers writing against your API can be aided by having a stricter convention.My convention is that each level of depth in a URI is describing an interaction with the parent resource, and the full URI should implicitly describe what is being retrieved.Suppose we have the following model.If I needed to provide a resource that allows a client to get the manager of a particular friend of a particular user, it might look something like:GET /users/{id}/friends/{friendId}/managerThe following are some more examples:Notice how each level maps to a parent that can be acted upon. Using different parents for the same object is counterintuitive. Retrieving a resource at GET /resource/123 leaves no indication that creating a new resource should be done at POST /resources
