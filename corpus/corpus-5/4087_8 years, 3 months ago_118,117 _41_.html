I find grep\'s --color=always flag to be tremendously useful. However, grep only prints lines with matches (unless you ask for context lines). Given that each line it prints has a match, the highlighting doesn\'t add as much capability as it could.I\'d really like to cat a file and see the entire file with the pattern matches highlighted.Is there some way I can tell grep to print every line being read regardless of whether there\'s a match? I know I could write a script to run grep on every line of a file, but I was curious whether this was possible with standard grep.Here are some ways to do it:Here\'s something along the same lines. Chances are, you\'ll be using less anyway, so try this:It will highlight the pattern and jump to the first occurrence of it in the file. I\'d like to recommend ack -- better than grep, a power search tool for programmers.I love it because it defaults to recursive searching of directories (and does so much smarter than grep -r), supports full Perl regular expressions (rather than the POSIXish regex(3)), and has a much nicer context display when searching many files.You can also create an alias. Add this function in your .bashrc (or .bash_profile on osx)You can now use the alias like this: "ifconfig | grepe inet" or "grepe css index.html".(PS: don\'t forget to source ~/.bashrc to reload bashrc on current session)You can use my highlight script from https://github.com/kepkin/dev-shell-essentialsIt\'s better than grep because you can highlight each match with its own color.Use colout program: http://nojhan.github.io/colout/It is designed to add color highlights to a text stream. Given a regex and a color (e.g. "red"), it reproduces a text stream with matches highlighted. e.g:You can chain multiple invocations to add multiple different color highlights:Or you can achieve the same thing by using a regex with N groups (parenthesised parts of the regex), followed by a comma separated list of N colors.I use rcg from "Linux Server Hacks", O\'Reilly.  It\'s perfect for what you want and can highlight multiple expressions each with different colours.Ok, this is one way,will give you the line count -- say NN, then you can doHere is a shell script that uses Awk\'s gsub function to replace the text you\'re searching for with the proper escape sequence to display it in bright red:Use it like so:Unfortunately, it doesn\'t have all the functionality of grep.For more information , you can refer to an article "So You Like Color" in Linux JournalOne other answer mentioned grep\'s -Cn switch which includes n lines of Context.  I sometimes do this with n=99 as a quick-and-dirty way of getting [at least] a screenfull of context when the egrep pattern seems too fiddly, or when I\'m on a machine on which I\'ve not installed rcg and/or ccze.I recently discovered ccze which is a more powerful colorizer.  My only complaint is that it is screen-oriented (like less, which I never use for that reason) unless you specify the -A switch for "raw ANSI" output.+1 for the rcg mention above.  It is still my favorite since it is so simple to customize in an alias.  Something like this is usually in my ~/.bashrc:alias tailc=\'tail -f /my/app/log/file | rcg send "BOLD GREEN" receive "CYAN" error "RED"\'another dirty way:I did anin bashrc.Alternatively you can use The Silver Searcher and doIf you want highlight several patterns with different colors see this bash script.Basic usage:You can change patterns and colors while running pressing one key and then enter key.I added this to my .bash_aliases:To highlight patterns while viewing the whole file, h can do this.Plus it uses different colors for different patterns.You can also pipe the output of h to less -R for better reading.To grep and use 1 color for each pattern, cxpgrep could be a good fit.
