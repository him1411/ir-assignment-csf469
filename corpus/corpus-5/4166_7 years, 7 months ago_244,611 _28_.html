How does one use Chrome desktop notifications? I\'d like that use that in my own code.Update: Here\'s a blog post explaining webkit notifications with an example.Below is a working example of desktop notifications for Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari.\nTry it live on JSBin.We\'re using the W3C Notifications API, documented at MDN. Do not confuse this with the Chrome extensions notifications API, which is different. Chrome extension notifications obviously only work in Chrome extensions, don\'t require any special permission from the user, support rich text notifications, but disappear automatically and the user may not notice they have been triggered). W3C notifications work in many browsers (see support on caniuse), require user permission, stack on top of the previous notification and don\'t automatically disappear in Chrome (they do in Firefox).Notification support has been in continuous flux, with various APIs being deprecated over the last three years. If you\'re curious, check the previous edits of this answer to see what used to work in Chrome, and to learn the story of rich HTML notifications.Now the latest standard is at https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/.There\'s also a different call (though with the same parameters) to create notifications from service workers, which for some reason, don\'t have access to the Notification() constructor.See also notify.js for a helper library.Check the design and API specification (it\'s still a draft) or check the source from this webpage for a simple example: It\'s mainly a call to window.webkitNotifications.createNotification.If you want a more robust example (you\'re trying to create your own Google Chrome\'s extension, and would like to know how to deal with permissions, local storage and such), check out Gmail Notifier Extension: download the crx file instead of installing it, unzip it and read its source code.It appears that window.webkitNotifications has already been deprecated and removed. However, there\'s a new API, and it appears to work in the latest version of Firefox as well.codepenI like: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/notifications/quick/#toc-examples but it uses old variables, so the demo doesn\'t work anymore. webkitNotifications is now Notification.Notify.js is a wrapper around the new webkit notifications. It works pretty well.http://alxgbsn.co.uk/2013/02/20/notify-js-a-handy-wrapper-for-the-web-notifications-api/Here is nice documentation on APIs,https://developer.chrome.com/apps/notificationsAnd, official video explanation by Google,https://developers.google.com/live/shows/83992232-1001I made this simple Notification wrapper. It works on Chrome, Safari and Firefox.Probably on Opera, IE and Edge as well but I haven\'t tested it yet.Just get the notify.js file from here https://github.com/gravmatt/js-notify and put it into your page.Get it on BowerThis is how it works:You have to set the title but the json object as the second argument is optional.For some reason the accepted answer didn\'t work for me, I ended up using the following example:https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_codelab_alarms#create-notification
