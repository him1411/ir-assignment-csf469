This question already has an answer here:For example:I want it to be able to adjust its height according to the contents inside it, without using scroll.Add this to your <head> section:And change your iframe to this:As found on javascript.bigresource.comYou can use this library, which both initially sizes your iframe correctly and also keeps it at the right size by detecting whenever the size of the iframe\'s content changes (either via regular checking in a setInterval or via MutationObserver) and resizing it.https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizerThis works with both cross and same domain iframes.The suggestion by hjpotter92 does not work in safari!\nI have made a small adjustment to the script so it now works in Safari as well.Only change made is resetting height to 0 on every load in order to enable some browsers to decrease height.Add this to <head> tag:And add the following onload attribute to your iframe, like soHere is a compact version:The hjpotter92 answer works well enough in certain cases, but I found the iframe content often got bottom-clipped in Firefox & IE, while fine in Chrome.The following works well for me and fixes the clipping problem. The code was found at http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/iframes/height/. I have made a slight modification to take the onload attribute out of the HTML. Place the following code after the <iframe> HTML and before the closing </body> tag:Your iframe HTML:Note if you prefer to include the Javascript in the <head> of the document then you can revert to using an inline onload attribute in the iframe HTML, as in the dyn-web web page.Avoid inline JavaScript; you can use a class:And reference it with jQuery:jQuery\'s .contents() method method allows us to search through the immediate children of the element in the DOM tree.jQuery:Remember that the body of the page inner the iframe must have its heightCSS:This works for me (also with multiple iframes on one page):This works for me (mostly).Put this at the bottom of your page.The first half is from ???, and works when there is html in the iframe.\nThe second half sets the iframe to page height (not content height), when iframes class is iframe_fullHeight. You can use this if the content is a PDF or other such like, but you have to set the class. Also can only be used when being full height is appropriate.Note: for some reason, when it recalculates after window resize, it gets height wrong.add this to your iframe: \nonload="autoResize(\'youriframeid\')"This option will work 100%I\'ve had problems in the past calling iframe.onload for dynamically created iframes, so I went with this approach for setting the iframe size:iFrame ViewMain View(this is only going to work if both views are in the same domain)I did it with AngularJS. Angular doesn\'t have an ng-load, but a 3rd party module was made; install with bower below, or find it here: https://github.com/andrefarzat/ng-loadGet the ngLoad directive: bower install ng-load --saveSetup your iframe:Controller resizeIframe function:Try this for IE11I wanted to make an iframe behave like a normal page (I needed to make a fullscreen banner inside an iframe element), so here is my script:The functions are self-explanatory and have comments to further explain their purpose.this is not working for chrome. But working for firefox.
