I\'m using Bootstrap 3 to build a responsive layout where I want to adjust a few font sizes according to the screen size.\nHow can I use media queries to make this kind of logic?Here are the selectors used in BS3, if you want to stay consistent:Here are the selectors used in BS4. There is no "lowest" setting in BS4 because "extra small" is the default. I.e. you would first code the XS size and then have these media overrides afterwards.Update 2017-01-19: BS3 info is still accurate as of version 3.3.7, updated BS4 for new grid released in 4.0.0b1.Based on bisio\'s answer and the Bootstrap 3 code, I was able to come up with a more accurate answer for anyone just looking to copy and paste the complete media query set into their stylesheet:If you\'re using LESS or SCSS/SASS and you\'re using a LESS/SCSS version of Bootstrap, you can use variables as well, provided you have access to them. A LESS translation of @full-decent\'s answer would be as follows:There are also variables for @screen-sm-max and @screen-md-max, which are 1 pixel less than @screen-md-min and @screen-lg-min, respectively, typically for use with @media(max-width).EDIT: If you\'re using SCSS/SASS, variables start with a $ instead of a @, so it\'d be $screen-xs-max etc.These are the values from Bootstrap3:Here are two examples.Once the viewport becomes 700px wide or less make all h1 tags 20px.Make all the h1\'s 20px until the viewport reaches 700px or larger.Hope this helps :0)Here is a more modular example using LESS to mimic Bootstrap without importing the less files.As of Bootstrap v3.3.6 the following media queries are used which corresponds with the documentation that outlines the responsive classes that are available (http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities).Media queries extracted from the Bootstrap GitHub repository from the following less files:-https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.3.6/less/responsive-utilities.less\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.3.6/less/variables.lessBased on the other users\' answers, I wrote these custom mixins for easier usage:Example usageExample usage:keep in mind that avoiding text scaling is the main reason responsive layouts exist. the entire logic behind responsive sites is to create functional layouts that effectively display your content so its easily readable and usable on multiple screen sizes. Although It is necessary to scale text in some cases, be careful not to miniaturise your site and miss the point. heres an example anyway.Also keep in mind the 480 viewport has been dropped in bootstrap 3. We use the following media queries in our Less files to create the key breakpoints in our grid system.see also on Bootstrap you can see in my example font sizes and background colors are changing according to the screen sizeHere is an even easier one stop solution, including separate responsive files based on media queries.  This allows all the media query logic and include logic to only have to exist on one page, the loader.  It also allows to not have the media queries clutter up the responsive stylesheets themselves.base.less would look like thissm-min.less would look like thisyour index would just have to load the loader.lesseasy peasy..@media only screen and (max-width : 1200px) {}@media only screen and (max-width : 979px) {}@media only screen and (max-width : 767px) {}@media only screen and (max-width : 480px) {}@media only screen and (max-width : 320px) {}@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {} @media (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1024px) {} Use media queries for IE;
