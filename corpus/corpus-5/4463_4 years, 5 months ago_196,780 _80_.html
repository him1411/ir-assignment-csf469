In Terminal when I use .sublIt returns -bash: .subl: command not foundAnyone know how to open Sublime Text 3 from the command line in macOS?I finally got this to work on my OSX box. I used these steps to get it to work:Test subl from your ST installation:First, navigate to a small folder in Terminal that you want ST to open and enter the following command:NOTE: You may need to replace Sublime\\ Text.app in the command above to Sublime\\ Text\\ 3.app or Sublime\\ Text\\ 2.app depending upon where the application is stored in your Applications directory. The . at the end of the above command opens the current working directory you are located in (again make sure you\'re in a directory that only contains a few files!).If you DO NOT get Sublime Text opening your current working directory then the next set of steps will NOT work. If nothing happens or you get an error from Terminal it will be because it couldn\'t find the Sublime Text application. This would mean that you would have to check what you\'ve typed (spelling, etc.) OR that Sublime Text isn\'t installed!Check ".bash_profile":Now it\'s time to create your symbolic link in your PATH folder, BUT, before we do, let\'s check your profile file by using nano ~/.bash_profile. These are the following lines that pertain to having subl work on the command line for Sublime Text:The first line sets the location where you want Terminal to look for binaries on your machine, I\'m going to store my symbolic link in the /usr/local/bin directory - I guess you could store it anywhere provided you\'ve notified Terminal where to look for binaries.The second line is OPTIONAL and just sets Sublime Text as the default editor. The flag -w has been added and you can find out more about flags by going to the Sublime Text docs: ST3 subl or ST2 sublIf you do make any edits to this file once you have closed it, you need to run the command:to compile your newly applied edits. If you see any errors after sourcing your file get them fixed before moving to the final step.Create a symbolic link to Sublime Text:Now in your chosen path (I used /usr/local/bin) you now enter the following command:The /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl being EXACTLY the same location as what you entered and verified as working in STEP 1 above. The /usr/local/bin/subl being the location of where you want the symbolic link to be located - needs to be one of your PATH locations from STEP 2 above.Now when you navigate to a folder or file that you want to open in Sublime Text you now just enter subl followed by the name of the file or . to open the current working directory.Hope this helps!For MAC 10.8, as well as 10.10.1, also worked!!Assume : \n 1. You have already installed Homebrew. \n 2. /usr/local/bin is your $PATH. \n 3. You are on Yosemite or El Capitain.Edited Aug 4th 2017: MacOS Sierra 10.12.5 works as well confirmed by David Rawson , MacOS Sierra 10.12.6 confirmed by Alexander K. Solution : At first , run following script on Terminal app to create specific\n    symlink.Then,Hit return, it should instantly pop-up Sublime app.I\'m using oh-my-zsh on Mac OSX Mavericks and the symbol link didn\'t work for me, so I added an alias in my .zshrc file instead:Open a new terminal and you should be good to go, and type subl.This worked for me (I\'m using OS X Mavericks)First, create a symbolic link:Now you can open sublime withThe one I will use is very simple.this opens up the sublime text right away with ones that I worked on last time.There is a easy way to do this. It only takes a couple steps and you don\'t need to use the command line too much. If you new to the command line this is the way to do it. Step 1 : Finding the bin file to put the subl executable file inStep 2: Finding the executable fileMake sure that it gets copied and it\'s not a shortcut. If you do have a problem, view the usr/bin folder as icons and paste the subl in a empty area in the folder. It should not have a shortcut arrow in the icon image.The Symlink command from the Sublime Text 3 documentation won\'t work as there is no ~/bin/ directory in Home location on Mac OS X El Capitan or later.So, we\'ll need to place the symlink on the /usr/local/bin as this path would be in our $PATH variable in most cases.So, the following command should do the trick:Once you create the symlink correctly, you would be able to run the Sublime Text 3 like this: subl . (. means the current directory)Please note not to write into /usr/bin but instead into /usr/local/bin.\nThe first one is for app that write themselves the binary into the system and the latest is for that specific usage of making our own system-wide binaries (which is our case here when symlinking).Also /usr/local/bin is read after /usr/bin and therefore also a good place to override any default app.Considering this, the right symlinking would be:\nln -s /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl\nIn OS X Mavericks running Sublime Text 2 the following worked for me. Its handy to locate the file in the finder and drag and drop that into the terminal window so you can be sure the path is the correct one, I\'m not a huge terminal user so this was more comfortable for me. then you can go to the start of the path and start adding in the other parts like the shorthand UNIX commands. Hope this helpsIt works !!!! for me on MacOS Sierra 10.12.2and find it in terminal sublYou shouldn\'t pollute /usr/bin directory unless you really need to.\nI always use /usr/local/bin for those binaries that aren\'t managed by the distribution package manager. Why? Because if the package manager gets updated it\'ll always replace the files in /usr/bin.So what I\'d do is sudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/sublClose Sublime. Run this command. It will uninstall it. You won\'t lose your prefs. Then run it again. It will automatically bind subl.You can just add an aliasThen you should be able to open a folder or whatever withYou can create a new alias in Terminal:Copy this line and paste it into the editor:Hit control + x, then y, then enter to save and close it.Close all Terminal windows and open it up again.That\'s it, you can now use subl filename or subl .if you have subl set up to be called from the command line, the proper command to open the current directory is:subl ."OS X Command Line" is a link on how to make sure everything is set up.I would add that if you are upgrading from Sublime Text 2, go into /usr/bin and delete your old subl first before following the same instructions above. It\'s worth the upgrade.For anyone looking for opening a file with Sublime on mac from terminalThis is to get it working as an ALIAS, not a Symbolic link!  This will allow you to run additional commands in the terminal without interrupting the subl session.   Using many of the symbolic link answers here (ln -s), cause the terminal process to endure while using Sublime text.  If you want the separation, create an alias in the Bash profile like so:Test subl from your ST installation:First, navigate to a folder in Terminal that you want ST to open and enter the following command:NOTE: You may need to replace Sublime\\ Text.app in the command above to Sublime\\ Text\\ 3.app or Sublime\\ Text\\ 2.app depending upon where the application is stored in your Applications directory. The . at the end of the above command opens the current working directory you are located in (again make sure you\'re in a directory that only contains a few files!).If you DO NOT get Sublime Text opening your current working directory then the next set of steps will NOT work. If nothing happens or you get an error from Terminal it will be because it couldn\'t find the Sublime Text application. This would mean that you would have to check what you\'ve typed (spelling, etc.) OR that Sublime Text isn\'t installed!Check and update ".bash_profile":Now add the alias in your Bash Profile. Open it via vim ~/.bash_profile. These are the following lines that pertain to having subl work on the command line for Sublime Text:I suggest always commenting your code in here with ##.  The second line is OPTIONAL and just sets Sublime Text as the default editor. The flag -w has been added and you can find out more about flags by going to the Sublime Text docs: ST3 subl or ST2 sublIf you do make any edits to this file once you have closed it, you need to source this file in your current session or close the terminal (tab) and open a new one. You can source this file by running the command source ~/.bash_profile Resolve any errors before moving to the final step.I achieve this with just one line in terminal (with Sublime 3):Adding this to ur .bashrc or .zshrc is a simple solution.alias sublime="open -a /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app"Try this.I\'m on a mac and this worked for me:
