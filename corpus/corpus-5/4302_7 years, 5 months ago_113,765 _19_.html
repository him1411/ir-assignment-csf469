I have a LinearLayout inside a ScrollView that has android:layout_height="fill_parent", but it doesn\'t expand to the full height of the ScrollView. My layout looks something like:I can see that the LinearLayout doesn\'t expand the full height of the ScrollView because in Eclipse in Android Layout Editor, if I select the ScrollView (in the Outline panel) it is highlighted with a red border that fills the screen to the bottom but when I select the LinearLayout its highlight doesn\'t expand to the bottom of the screen. How can I get it to do so?The effect I\'m trying to achieve is to have some text and a button below it (inside the LinearLayout in level 4 there\'s just a button). The text can be big enough to need a scrollbar, in which case I want the user to have to scroll down in order to see the button. In case the text is not big enough for a scroll bar, I want the LinearLayout containing the button to stick to the bottom of the screen.At first I thought I shouldn\'t post the full XML because it\'s usually a turn-down to see a huge chunk of code in a question. However, it seems it might be necessary, so here\'s the full layout.At the moment I have resorted to android:layout_gravity="bottom" on the problematic LinearLayout, which makes the button stick to the bottom of the screen no matter what. But that also makes the text stick to the bottom of the screen, which is not exactly what I was after.Update: scratch that, android:layout_gravity="bottom" makes the ScrollView unable to, well, scroll. Other ideas?Found the solution myself in the end. The problem was not with the LinearLayout, but with the ScrollView (seems weird, considering the fact that the ScrollView was expanding, while the LinearLayout wasn\'t).The solution was to use android:fillViewport="true" on the ScrollView.I know this post is very old, For those who don\'t want to use android:fillViewport="true" because it sometimes doesn\'t bring up the edittext above keyboard. \nUse Relative layout instead of LinearLayout it solves the purpose.Can you provide your layout xml?  Doing so would allow people to recreate the issue with minimal effort.You might have to setfor the item that you want expandedI have dynamically used to get this . I have a LinearLayout and within this used ScrollView as a child. Then i take again LinearLayout and add what ever View u want to this LinearLayout and then this LinearLayout add to ScrollView and finally add this ScrollView to LinearLayout. Then u can get scroll in ur ScrollView and nothing will left to visible.LinearLayout(Parent)--ScrollView(child of LinerLayout) -- LinearLayout(child of ScrollView)-- add here textView, Buttons , spinner etc whatever u want . Then add this LinearLyout to ScrollView. Bcoz only one CHILD for ScrollView applicable and last add this ScrollView to LinearLyout.If defined area is exceed from Screen size then u will get a Scroll within ScrollView.In my case i haven\'t given the orientation of LinearLayout(ScrollView\'s Child)So by default it takes horizontal, but scrollview scrols vertically, so please check if \'android:orientation="vertical"\' is set to your ScrollView\'s Child(In the case of LinearLayout).This was my case hopes it helps somebody.
