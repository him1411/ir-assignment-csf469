Is there a simple way to change the default error values in the jQuery validation plugin?I just want to rewrite the error messages to be more personal to my app--I have a lot of fields, so I don\'t want to set the message individually for field x...I know I can do that!Add this code in a separate file/script included after the validation plugin to override the messages, edit at will :)You can specify your own messages in the validate call.
