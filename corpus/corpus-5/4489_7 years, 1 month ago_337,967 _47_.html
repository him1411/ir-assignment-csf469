How to perform left outer join in C# LINQ to objects without using join-on-equals-into clauses? Is there any way to do that with where clause?\nCorrect problem: \nFor inner join is easy and I have a solution like thisbut for left outer join I need a solution. Mine is something like this but it\'s not workingwhere JoinPair is a class:As stated on:101 LINQ Samples - Left outer joinNecromancing. \nA significantly more readable left outer join can be written as such:If you omit the DefaultIfEmpty() you will have an inner join.Take the accepted answer:This syntax is very confusing. Detailed ExampleWhen used with LINQ 2 SQL it will translate nicely to the following very legible SQL query:Edit:See also "\nConvert SQL Server query to Linq query "\nfor a more complex example. Also, If you\'re doing it in Linq-2-objects (instead of Linq-2-SQL), you should do it the old-fashioned way (because LINQ to SQL translates this correctly to join operations, but over objects this method forces a full scan, and doesn\'t take advantage of index searches, whyever...): Using lambda expressionTake a look at this example.\nThis query should work:An implementation of left outer join by extension methods could look likeThe resultselector then has to take care of the null elements. Fx.Now as an extension method:Use like you would normally use join:Hope this saves you some time.Here\'s an example if you need to join more than 2 tables:Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/a/17142392/2343There are three tables: persons, schools and persons_schools, which connects persons to the schools they study in. A reference to the person with id=6 is absent in the table persons_schools. However the person with id=6 is presented in the result lef-joined grid.take look at this example here is the reference How to: Perform Left Outer Joins (C# Programming Guide)This is the general form (as already provided in other answers)However here\'s an explanation that I hope will clarify what this actually means!essentially creates a separate result set b_temp that effectively includes null \'rows\' for entries on the right hand side (entries in \'b\').Then the next line:..iterates over that result set, setting the default null value for the \'row\' on the right hand side, and setting the result of the right hand side row join to the value of \'b_value\' (i.e. the value that\'s on the right hand side,if there\'s a matching record, or \'null\' if there isn\'t).Now, if the right hand side is the result of a separate LINQ query, it will consist of anonymous types, which can only either be \'something\' or \'null\'. If it\'s an enumerable however (e.g. a List - where MyObjectB is a class with 2 fields), then it\'s possible to be specific about what default \'null\' values are used for its properties:This ensures that \'b\' itself isn\'t null (but its properties can be null, using the default null values that you\'ve specified), and this allows you to check properties of b_value without getting a null reference exception for b_value. Note that for a nullable DateTime, a type of (DateTime?) i.e. \'nullable DateTime\' must be specified as the \'Type\' of the null in the specification for the \'DefaultIfEmpty\' (this will also apply to types that are not \'natively\' nullable e.g double, float).You can perform multiple left outer joins by simply chaining the above syntax.This is a SQL syntax compare to LINQ syntax for inner and left outer joins. \nLeft Outer Join:http://www.ozkary.com/2011/07/linq-to-entity-inner-and-left-joins.html"The following example does a group join between product and category. This is essentially the left join. The into expression returns data even if the category table is empty. To access the properties of the category table, we must now select from the enumerable result by adding the from cl in catList.DefaultIfEmpty() statement.If you need to join and filter on something, that can be done outside of the join.  Filter can be done after creating the collection. In this case if I do this in the join condition I reduce the rows that are returned. Ternary condition is used  (= n == null ? "__" : n.MonDayNote,)If the object is null (so no match), then return what is after the ?. __, in this case.Else, return what is after the :, n.MonDayNote.Thanks to the other contributors that is where I started with my own issue.OUTPUTSimple solution for the LEFT OUTER JOIN:notes:
