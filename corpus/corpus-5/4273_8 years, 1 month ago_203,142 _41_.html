In a directory, I have a bunch of *.html files.I\'d like to rename them all to *.txtI use the bash shell.For an better solution (with only bash functionality, as opposed to external calls), see one of the other answers.The following would do and does not require the system to have the rename program (although you would most often have this on a system):EDIT: As pointed out in the comments, this does not work for filenames with spaces in them without proper quoting (now added above). When working purely on your own files that you know do not have spaces in the filenames this will work but whenever you write something that may be reused at a later time, do not skip proper quoting. if using bash, no need for external commands like sed, basename, rename, expr...etcdoes exactly what you want.You want to use rename :This does exactly what you want - it will change the extension from .html to .txt for all files matching *.html.Note: Greg Hewgill correctly points out this is not a bash builtin; and is a seperate Linux command. If you just need something on Linux this should work fine; if you need something more cross-platform then take a look at one of the other answers.This worked for me on OSX from .txt to .txt_bakOn a Mac...For Ubuntu Users : Here is an example of the rename command:The -n means that it\'s a test run and will not actually change any files. It will show you a list of files that would be renamed if you removed the -n. In the case above, it will convert all files in the current directory from a file extension of .htm to .html.If the output of the above test run looked ok then you could run the final version:The -v is optional, but it\'s a good idea to include it because it is the only record you will have of changes that were made by the rename command as shown in the sample output below:The tricky part in the middle is a Perl substitution with regular expressions, highlighted below:After someone else\'s website crawl, I ended up with thousands of files missing the .html extension, across a wide tree of subdirectories.To rename them all in one shot, except the files already having a .html extension (most of them had none at all), this worked for me:In the OP\'s case I might modify that slightly, to only rename *.txt files, like so:Broken down (hammertime!):-iname *.txt\n  - Means consider ONLY files already ending in .txtmv -iv "{}.{txt,html}"\n  - When find passes a {} as the filename, ${filename%.*} extracts its basename without any extension to form the parameters to mv. bash takes the {txt,html} to rewrite it as two parameters so the final command runs as: mv -iv "filename.txt" "filename.html"Fix needed though: dealing with spaces in filenamesTry thisusage: A bit late to the party. You could do it with xargs:Or if all your files are in some folderUnfortunately it\'s not trivial to do portably. You probably need a bit of expr magic.Remove the echo once you\'re happy it does what you want.Edit: basename is probably a little more readable for this particular case, although expr is more flexible in general.If you prefer PERL, there is a short PERL script (orignally written by Larry Wall, the creator of PERL) that will do exactly what you want here: \ntips.webdesign10.com/files/rename.pl.txt.\nFor your example the following should do the trickrename.pl \'s/html/txt/\' *.html= )(Thanks @loretoparisi for the updated URL)This question explicitly mentions Bash, but if you happen to have ZSH available it is pretty simple:If you get zsh: command not found: zmv then simply run:And then try again.Thanks to this original article for the tip about zmv.
