I want to update the top 100 records in SQL Server. I have  a table T1 with fields F1 and F2. T1 has 200 records. I want to update the F1 field in the top 100 records. How can I update based on TOP 100 in SQL Server?Note, the parentheses are required for UPDATE statements:Without an ORDER BY the whole idea of TOP doesn\'t make much sense. You need to have a consistent definition of which direction is "up" and which is "down" for the concept of top to be meaningful.Nonetheless SQL Server allows it but doesn\'t guarantee a deterministic result.The UPDATE TOP syntax in the accepted answer does not support an ORDER BY clause but it is possible to get deterministic semantics here by using a CTE or derived table to define the desired sort order as below.for those like me still stuck with SQL Server 2000, SET ROWCOUNT {number}; can be used before the UPDATE querywill limit the update to 100 rowsIt has been deprecated at least since SQL 2005, but as of SQL 2012 it still works.\nEDIT: it was killed in SQL 2014. Using SET ROWCOUNT will not affect DELETE, INSERT, and UPDATE statements in SQL Server 2014 and above.What\'s even cooler is the fact that you can use an inline Table-Valued Function to select which (and how many via TOP) row(s) to update. That is:For the table valued function you have something interesting to select the row to update like:..., and there lies (in my humble opinion) the true power of updating only top selected rows deterministically while at the same time simplifying the syntax of the UPDATE statement.
