I need to count the number of occurrences of a character in a string.For example, suppose my string contains:I want to find the count of comma , character, which is 3. And the count of individual strings after the split along comma, which is 4.I also need to validate that each of the strings i.e str1 or str2 or str3 or str4 should not exceed, say, 15 characters.I have updated this answer. I like the idea of using a match better, but it is slower:jsfiddleUse a regular expression literal if you know what you are searching for beforehand, if not you can use the RegExp constructor, and pass in the g flag as an argument.match returns null with no results thus the || []The original answer I made in 2009 is below. It creates an array unnecessarily, but using a split is faster (as of September 2014). I\'m ambivalent, if I really needed the speed there would be no question that I would use a split, but I would prefer to use match.Old answer (from 2009):If you\'re looking for the commas:If you\'re looking for the strBoth in @Lo\'s answer and in my own silly jsperf test split comes ahead in speed, at least in Chrome, but again creating the extra array just doesn\'t seem sane.There are at least four ways. The best option, which should also be the fastest -owing to the native RegEx engine -, is placed at the top. jsperf.com is currently down, otherwise I would provide you with performance statistics.Update: Please, find the performance tests here, and run them yourselves, so as to contribute your performance results. The specifics of the results will be given later.split not recommended. Resource hungry. Allocates new instances of \'Array\' for each match. Don\'t try that for a >100MB file via FileReader. You can actually easily observe the EXACT resource usage using Chrome\'s profiler option.searching for a single characterUpdate:element mapping and filtering, not recommended due to its overall resource preallocation rather than using Pythonian \'generators\'Share:\nI made this gist, with currently 8 methods of character-counting, so we can directly pool and share our ideas - just for fun, and perhaps some interesting benchmarks :)https://gist.github.com/2757250A quick Google search got this (from http://www.codecodex.com/wiki/index.php?title=Count_the_number_of_occurrences_of_a_specific_character_in_a_string#JavaScript)Use it like this:Add this function to sting prototype :usage:ok, an other one with regexp - probably not fast, but short and better readable then others, in my case just \'_\' to countjust remove everything that does not look like your char \nbut it does not look nice with a string as inputI have found that the best approach to search for a character in a very large string (that is 1 000 000 characters long, for example) is to use the replace() method.You can see yet another JSPerf suite to test this method along with other methods of finding a character in a string.I was working on a small project that required a sub-string counter. Searching for the wrong phrases provided me with no results, however after writing my own implementation I have stumbled upon this question. Anyway, here is my way, it is probably slower than most here but might be helpful to someone:http://jsfiddle.net/5ZzHt/1/Please let me know if you find this implementation to fail or do not follow some standards! :)UPDATE\nYou may want to substitute:With:Interesting read discussing the above:\nhttp://www.erichynds.com/blog/javascript-length-property-is-a-stored-valueI made a slight improvement on the accepted answer, it allows to check with case-sensitive/case-insensitive matching, and is a method attached to the string object:lit is the string to search for ( such as \'ex\' ), and cis is case-insensitivity, defaulted to false, it will allow for choice of case insensitive matches.\namount_of_os would be equal to 2.\nThis time, amount_of_os would be equal to 3, since the capital O from the string gets included in the search.Performance of Split vs RegExpEasiest way i found out...Example-Here is a similar solution, but it uses reduce As was mentioned, split much faster than replace.What about string.split(desiredCharecter).length-1Example:var str = "hellow how is life";\nvar len = str.split("h").length-1; will give count 2 for character "h" in the above string;I\'m using Node.js v.6.0.0 and the fastest is the one with index (the 3rd method in Lo Sauer\'s answer).The second is:If you are using lodash, the _.countBy method will do this:This method also work with array:Here\'s one almost as fast as the split and the replace methods, which are a tiny bit faster than the regex method (in chrome).The following uses a regular expression to test the length. testex ensures you don\'t have 16 or greater consecutive non-comma characters. If it passes the test, then it proceeds to split the string. counting the commas is as simple as counting the tokens minus one.My solution:I just did a very quick and dirty test on repl.it using Node v7.4. For a single character, the standard for loop is quickest:Some code:Results from a few runs:
