Is it possible to limit a text length to "n" lines using CSS (or cut it when overflows vertically).text-overflow: ellipsis; only works for 1 line text.  original text:Ultrices natoque mus mattis, aliquam, cras in pellentesque\n  tincidunt elit purus lectus, vel ut aliquet, elementum nunc\n  nunc rhoncus placerat urna! Sit est sed! Ut penatibus turpis\n  mus tincidunt! Dapibus sed aenean, magna sagittis, lorem velitwanted output (2 lines):Ultrices natoque mus mattis, aliquam, cras in pellentesque\n  tincidunt elit purus lectus, vel ut aliquet, elementum...There is a way, but it is webkit-only. However, when you combine this with line-height: X;, and max-height: X*N;, it will also work in other browsers, just without ellipses.What you can do is the following:where max-height: = line-height: Ã— <number-of-lines> in em.As far as I can see, this would be possible only using height: (some em value); overflow: hidden and even then it wouldn\'t have the fancy ... at the end.If that is not an option, I think it\'s impossible without some server side pre-processing (difficult because text flow is impossible to predict reliably) or jQuery (possible but probably complicated).The solution from this thread is to use the jquery plugin dotdotdot. Not a CSS solution, but it gives you a lot of options for "read more" links, dynamic resizing etc. Working Cross-browser SolutionThis problem has been plaguing us all for years... To help in all cases, I have laid out the CSS only approach, and a jQuery approach in case the css caveats are a problem.Here\'s a CSS only solution I came up with that works in all circumstances, with a few minor caveats. The basics are simple, it hides the overflow of the span, and sets the max height based on the line height as suggested by Eugene Xa.Then there is a pseudo class after the containing div that places the ellipsis nicely. CaveatsThis solution will always place the ellipsis, regardless if there is need for it.If the last line ends with an ending sentence, you will end up with four dots.... You will need to be happy with justified text alignment.The ellipsis will be to the right of the text, which can look sloppy.Code + SnippetjsfiddlejQuery ApproachIn my opinion this is the best solution, but not everyone can use JS.\nBasically, the jQuery will split the text into an array of words, limited to the number of words you want, then output those words with an ellipses.\nThere are no caveats to this approach.Code & Snippetjsfiddle\nCurrently you can\'t, but in future you will be able to use text-overflow:ellipis-lastline. Currently it\'s available with vendor prefix in \nOpera 10.60+: examplefollowing CSS class helped me in getting two line ellipsis.I have a solution which works well but instead an ellipsis it uses a gradient. It works when you have dynamic text so you don\'t know if it will be long enough to need an ellipse.  The advantages are that you don\'t have to do any JavaScript calculations and it works for variable width containers including table cells and is cross-browser. It uses a couple of extra divs, but it\'s very easy to implement.Markup:CSS:blog post: http://salzerdesign.com/blog/?p=453example page: http://salzerdesign.com/test/fade.htmlBasic Example Code, learning to code is easy. Check Style CSS comments.I really like line-clamp, but no support for firefox yet.. so i go with a math calc and just hide the overflownow lets say you want to remove and add this class via jQuery with a link, you will need to have an extra pixel so the max-height it will be 63 px, this is because you need to check every time if the height greather than 62px, but in the case of 4 lines you will get a false true, so an extra pixel will fix this and it will no create any extra problemsi will paste a coffeescript for this just to be an example, uses a couple of links that are hidden by default, with classes read-more and read-less, it will remove the ones that the overflow is not need it and remove the body-overflow classesI\'ve been looking around for this, but then I realize, damn my website uses php!!! \nWhy not use the trim function on the text input and play with the max length.... Here is a possible solution too for those using php:\nhttp://ideone.com/PsTaI
