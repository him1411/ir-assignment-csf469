Do any of you know how to nicely handle anchor hash linking in AngularJS?I have the following markup for a simple FAQ-pageWhen clicking on any of the above links AngularJS intercepts and routes me to a completely different page (in my case, a 404-page as there are no routes matching the links.)My first thought was to create a route matching "/faq/:chapter" and in the corresponding controller check $routeParams.chapter after a matching element and then use jQuery to scroll down to it.\nBut then AngularJS shits on me again and just scrolls to the top of the page anyway.So, anyone here done anything similar in the past and knows a good solution to it?Edit: Switching to html5Mode should solve my problems but we kinda have to support IE8+ anyway  so I fear it\'s not an accepted solution :/You\'re looking for $anchorScroll().Here\'s the (crappy) documentation.And here\'s the source.Basically you just inject it and call it in your controller, and it will scroll you to any element with the id found in $location.hash()Here is a plunker to demonstrateEDIT: to use this with routingSet up your angular routing as usual, then just add the following code.and your link would look like this:Here is a Plunker demonstrating scrolling with routing and $anchorScrollAnd even simpler:and your link would look like this:in my case I noticed that the routing logic was kicking in if I modified the location hash. the following trick worked..There is no need to change any routing or anything else just need to use target="_self" when creating the links Example:And use the id attribute in your html elements like this:    There is no need to use ## as pointed/mentioned in comments ;-)If you always know the route, you can simply append the anchor like this:where route is the current angular route and anchorID matches an <a id="anchorID"> somewhere on the pageThis was my solution using a directive which seems more Angular-y because we\'re dealing with the DOM:Plnkr over heregithubI used the $anchorScroll service. To counteract the page-refresh that goes along with the hash changing I went ahead and cancelled the locationChangeStart event. This worked for me because I had a help page hooked up to an ng-switch and the refreshes would esentially break the app. $anchorScroll works for this, but there\'s a much better way to use it in more recent versions of Angular. Now, $anchorScroll accepts the hash as an optional argument, so you don\'t have to change $location.hash at all. (documentation)This is the best solution because it doesn\'t affect the route at all. I couldn\'t get any of the other solutions to work because I\'m using ngRoute and the route would reload as soon as I set $location.hash(id), before $anchorScroll could do its magic.Here is how to use it... first, in the directive or controller:and then in the view:Also, if you need to account for a fixed navbar (or other UI), you can set the offset for $anchorScroll like this (in the main module\'s run function):Try to set a hash prefix for angular routes $locationProvider.hashPrefix(\'!\')Full example:I got around this in the route logic for my app. This is an old post, but I spent a long time researching various solutions so I wanted to share one more simple one. Just adding target="_self" to the <a> tag fixed it for me. The link works and takes me to the proper location on the page.However, Angular still injects some weirdness with the # in the URL so you may run into trouble using the back button for navigation and such after using this method.This may be a new attribute for ngView, but I\'ve been able to get it anchor hash links to work with angular-route using the ngView autoscroll attribute and \'double-hashes\'. ngView (see autoscroll)(The following code was used with angular-strap)I could do this like so:Here is kind of dirty workaround by creating custom directive that will scrolls to specified element (with hardcoded "faq")http://plnkr.co/edit/Po37JFeP5IsNoz5ZycFs?p=previewYou could try to use anchorScroll.ExampleSo the controller would be:And the view:...and no secret for the anchor id:If you don\'t like to use ng-click here\'s an alternate solution. It uses a filter to generate the correct url based on the current state. My example uses ui.router.The benefit is that the user will see where the link goes on hover.The filter:Get your scrolling feature easily.  It also supports Animated/Smooth scrolling as an additional feature.

Lets say you are on ABOUT page and you have the following route:Now, in you HTMLIn conclusionIncluding the page name before the anchor did the trick for me.\nLet me know about your thoughts.Downside This will re-render the page and then scroll to the anchor.UPDATEA better way is to add the following:On Route change it will scroll to the top of the page.put this code on your controller.In my mind @slugslog had it, but I would change one thing. I would use replace instead so you don\'t have to set it back.Docs Search for "Replace method"None of the solution above works for me, but I just tried this, and it worked,So I realized I need to notify the page to start with the index page and then use the traditional anchor. Sometime in angularjs application hash navigation not work and bootstrap jquery javascript libraries make extensive use of this type of navigation, to make it work add target="_self" to anchor tag.\ne.g. <a data-toggle="tab" href="#id_of_div_to_navigate" target="_self">See https://code.angularjs.org/1.4.10/docs/api/ngRoute/provider/$routeProvider[reloadOnSearch=true] - {boolean=} - reload route when only $location.search() or $location.hash() changes.Setting this to false did the trick without all of the above for me.I\'m using AngularJS 1.3.15 and looks like I don\'t have to do anything special.https://code.angularjs.org/1.3.15/docs/api/ng/provider/$anchorScrollProviderSo, the following works for me in my html:I didn\'t have to make any changes to my controller or JavaScript at all.
