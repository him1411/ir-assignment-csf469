This question already has an answer here:I have this field:For each Hash<String, HashMap> I need to create a ComboBox, whose items are the value (which happens to be a HashMap itself) of HashMap <String, **HashMap**>.By way of (non-functioning) demonstration:I know I\'m a bit late for that one, but I\'ll share what I did too, in case it helps someone else :Lambda Expression Java 8In Java 1.8 (Java 8) this has become lot easier by using forEach method from Aggregate operations(Stream operations) that looks similar to iterators from Iterable Interface. Just copy paste below statement to your code and rename the HashMap variable from hm to your HashMap variable to print out key-value pair.Here is an example where a Lambda Expression is used:Also one can use Spliterator for the same.UPDATEIncluding documentation links to Oracle Docs.\nFor more on Lambda go to this link and must read Aggregate Operations and for Spliterator go to this link.Map.values():You can iterate over a HashMap (and many other collections) using an iterator, e.g.:I generally do the same as cx42net, but I don\'t explicitly create an Entry.This just seems the most intuitive to me, I think I\'m prejudiced against iterating over the values of a map.Use entrySet, see example here:As mentioned already, in Java 8 we have got forEach method that accepts a lambda expression. But we have also got stream APIs. Iterate over entries (Using forEach and Streams):The advantage with streams is they can be parallelized easily and can be useful when we have multiple CPUs at disposal. We simply need to use parallelStream() in place of stream() above. If we want to iterate over keys we can use sample.keySet() and for values sample.values().
