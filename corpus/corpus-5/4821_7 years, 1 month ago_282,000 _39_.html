What is the purpose and usage of @ModelAttribute in Spring MVC?@ModelAttribute refers to a property of the Model object (the M in MVC ;)\nso let\'s say we have a form with a form backing object that is called "Person"\nThen you can have Spring MVC supply this object to a Controller method by using the @ModelAttribute annotation:Check here for an example (Spring 2.5), also see "Using @ModelAttribute on a method argument" (Spring 3.1).On the other hand the annotation is used to define objects which should be part of a Model.\nSo if you want to have a Person object referenced in the Model you can use the following method:This annotated method will allow access to the Person object in your View, since it gets automatically added to the Models by Spring. See "Using @ModelAttribute on a method" (Spring 3.1).Hope this helped.I know this is an old thread, but I thought I throw my hat in the ring and see if I can muddy the water a little bit more :)I found my initial struggle to understand @ModelAttribute was a result of Spring\'s decision to combine several annotations into one. It became clearer once I split it into several smaller annotations:For parameter annotations, think of @ModelAttribute as the equivalent of @Autowired + @Qualifier i.e. it tries to retrieve a bean with the given name from the Spring managed model. If the named bean is not found, instead of throwing an error or returning null, it implicitly takes on the role of @Bean i.e. Create a new instance using the default constructor and add the bean to the model.For method annotations, think of @ModelAttribute as the equivalent of @Bean + @Before, i.e. it puts the bean constructed by user\'s code in the model and it\'s always called before a request handling method.Figuratively, I see @ModelAttribute as the following (please don\'t take it literally!!):As you can see, Spring made the right decision to make @ModelAttribute an all-encompassing annotation; no one wants to see an annotation smorgasbord.For my style, I always use @ModelAttribute to catch object from spring form jsp. for example, I design form on jsp page, that form exist with commandNameand I catch the object on controller with follow codeand every field name of book must be match with path in sub-element of form So I will try to explain it in simpler way. Let\'s have:As described in the Spring MVC documentation - the @ModelAttribute annotation can be used on methods or on method arguments. And of course we can have both use at the same time in one controller.1.Method annotationPurpose of such method is to add attribute in the model. So in our case cities key will have the list new Arras.asList(new[]{\xe2\x80\x9cSofia\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x9dPleven","Ruse\xe2\x80\x9d}) as value in the Model (you can think of Model as map(key:value)).  @ModelAttribute methods in a controller are invoked before @RequestMapping methods, within the same controller. Here we want to add to the Model common information which will be used in the form to display to the user. For example it can be used to fill a HTML select:2.Method argumentAn @ModelAttribute on a method argument indicates the argument should be retrieved from the model. So in this case we expect that we have in the Model  person object as key and we want to get its value and put it to the method argument Person person. If such does not exists or (sometimes you misspell the (value="persson")). Then Spring will not find it in the Model and will create empty Person object using its defaults. Then will take the request parameters and try to data bind them in the Person object using their names.So we have name and it will be bind to Person.name using setName(String name). So in we have access to this filled name with value "Dimitrij".Of course Spring can bind more complex objects like Lists, Maps, List of Sets of Maps and so on but behind the scene it makes the data binding magic.We can have at the same time model annotated method and request method handler with @ModelAttribute in the arguments. Then we have to union the rules. Of course we have tons of different situations - @ModelAttribute methods can also be defined in an @ControllerAdvice and so on...Annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute, exposed to a web view. This is used for data binding purposes in Spring MVC. Let you have a jsp having a form element in it e.gon JSP<form:form  action="test-example" method="POST"    commandName="testModelAttribute"> </form:form>(Spring Form method, Simple form element can also be used)On Controller SideNow when you will submit the form the form fields values will be available to you.@ModelAttribute can be used as the method arguments / parameter or before the method declaration.\n The primary objective of this annotation to bind the request parameters or form fields to an model objectRef. http://www.javabeat.net/modelattribute-spring-mvc/@ModelAttribute will create a attribute  with the name specified by you (@ModelAttribute("Testing") Test test) as Testing  in the given example ,Test being the bean test being the reference to the bean and Testing will be available in model so that you can further use it on jsp pages for retrieval of values that you stored in you ModelAttribute.
