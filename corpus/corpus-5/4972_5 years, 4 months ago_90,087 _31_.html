I\'m working with Bootstrap 2.0.3 using LESS. I want to customize it extensively, but I want to avoid making changes to the source whenever possible as changes to the libraries are frequent. I am new to LESS so I don\'t know how its compilation entirely works. What are some best practices for working with LESS or LESS based frameworks?My solution is similar jstam\'s, but I avoid making changes to the source files when possible.  Given that the changes to bootstrap will be frequent, I want to be able to pull down the latest source and make minimal changes by keeping my modifications in separate files.  Of course, it\'s not completely bullet proof.Copy the bootstrap.less and variables.less to the parent directory.  Rename bootstrap.less to theme.less or whatever you want. Your directory directory structure should look like this:Update all the references in theme.less to point to bootstrap sub-directory. Ensure that your variables.less is referenced from the parent and not the bootstrap directory like so:...Add your CSS overrides in the theme.less file immediately after where they are included.Link to theme.less instead of bootstrap.less in your HTML pages.Whenever a new version comes out, your changes should be safe. You should also do a diff between your custom bootstrap files whenever a new version comes out. Variables and imports may change.This is something I\'ve struggled with as well. On the one hand I want to highly customize the variables.less file with my own colors and settings. On the other hand, I want to change the Bootstrap files a little as possible to ease the upgrade process.My solution (for now) is to create an addon LESS file and insert it into the bootstrap.less file after the variables and mixins have been imported. So something like this:This way if I want to reset Bootstrap colors, fonts or add additional mixins I can. My code is separate yet will be compiled within the rest of the Bootstrap imports. It\'s not perfect, but it\'s a stopgap that\'s worked well for me.From my side, I just have a file named theme.less with an import of boostrap.less in it, and just below I override (even if it seems to be bad using LESS, but well, it\'s easier to maintain) the variable value I wan\'t to update.This works well for having custom values for variables in variables.lessAfter that I compile my theme.less file instead off bootstrap.lessExample theme.less:A far better (IMHO) approach is to take cue from the Bootswatch github project called swatchmaker. This project is specifically tailored for building and managing the dozens of Bootstrap themes on the website.The Makefile in the project builds swatchmaker.less (you can rename it to something like customizations.less). This file contains a bunch of imports:You can rename the swatch folder and bootswatch.less files to whatever you find appropriate.This makes sense since you can upgrade Bootstrap without affecting your own files. In fact, the Makefile also contains commands to fetch the latest version of Bootstrap. See the README on the project page for more.As a bonus, the README also suggests that you install the watchr gem which will automatically build the project when a .less file changes.If (AND ONLY IF) you have the time you can do it as I do. I keep my own modified version of the framework(s) and with every update of the framework I read the docs and check the source for modifications.This solution might sound less ideal on the first look but I have my reasons to do so. I don\'t work with one but an amalgam of many frameworks, best practices, resets/normalization style sheets etc. and I am always sure that no update will ever change existing projects in any way I didn\'t see coming.I\'m working on and with my own custom framework for the following reasons.I came to the same solution as Joel:Custom Less FilesJust like described above: I create local copies for all Less files i am customizing: Such as: "variables-custom.less", "alerts-custom.less", "buttons-custom.less". So i can use some standards and have my own additions. The downside is: When Bootstrap will be update it\'s really hard to migrate. But there is something else:Override StylesWhen looking around for work-flows i often see people suggesting to simply override styles. So you import the standard Less files first and then add your custom declarations at the bottom. The upside here is: It\'s easier to update to a newer version. The downside is: The compiled CSS file includes all the overrides. Some CSS selectors are defined twice. So the browser needs to do some lifting to find out what to apply actually. That\'s not really clean.I am wondering why preprocessors are not clever enough to solve such double declarations? Is there any better work-flow i am missing here?Just add @import "../../styles.less"; (or wherever your stylesheet is) to bootstrap.less at the bottom. This allows you to use Bootstrap mixins like .gradient or .border-radius inside your own styles.less.
