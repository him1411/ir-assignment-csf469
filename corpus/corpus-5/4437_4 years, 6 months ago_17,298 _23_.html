I have a clojure program on a remote site, let\'s call it mccarthy.\nWhat I want to do is connect to a nrepl-ritz from my laptop, preferably using nrepl-ritz-jack-in.  The jack in works fine for a local program, but doesn\'t seem to connect to a remote program.C-x C-f on /mccarthy:code/program/project.clj(require \'nrepl-ritz)M-x nrepl-ritz-jack-inEmacs appears to hang.  If I go to the *nrepl-server* buffer, I see this:(and tons of other lines, too...)I am using drip on my laptop, but not on mccarthy, so clearly nrepl-ritz-jack-in is not detecting that it\'s a remote file.  Regular old nrepl-jack-in will work as expected in this case, however.I also tried starting an nrepl-ritz using lein on mccarthy:From my laptop I forward a port so local 42874 connects to 42874 on mccarthy:Then, from my local Emacs:M-x nreplHost: 127.0.0.1Port: 42874This gives me a connection:So to test it out, I runM-x nrepl-ritz-threadsIt gives me a nice table of threads.M-x nrepl-ritz-break-on-exceptionThis hangs, but sometimes shows a hidden debugging buffer with some restarts available.  If I tell it to pass the exception back to the program, it never gives control back to the REPL.I\'ve done plenty of searches but have not been able to get anything more specific than "make sure lein is on your path" (And I did do that, on both machines...).If the repl is still running from the previous cider-jack-in, you should either use the cidercommand to connect to the running instance, or stop the previous before starting a new one From Here `Clojure - connection issue re-running cider-jack-inAlso see this https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/debugging-clojure
