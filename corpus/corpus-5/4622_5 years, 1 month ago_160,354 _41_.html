I wish to add an ASP.NET Web API to an ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application project, developed in Visual Studio 2012. Which steps must I perform to add a functioning Web API to the project? I\'m aware that I need a controller deriving from ApiController, but that\'s about all I know.Let me know if I need to provide more details.The steps I needed to perform were:I could then learn enough from the tutorial (Your First ASP.NET Web API) to define my API controller.App_Start\\WebApiConfig.cs:Global.asax.cs:Update 10.16.2015:Word has it, the NuGet package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi must be installed for the above to work.UPDATE 11/22/2013 - this is the latest WebApi package:Original answer (this is an older WebApi package)More details.To add WebAPI in my MVC 5 project.Finally able to make it work after few hours of struggling...\nThis SO post helped..1 Open NuGet Package manager consol and run2 Add references to System.Web.Routing, System.Web.Net, System.Net.Http dlls\nif not there already3 Right click controllers folder > add new item > web > Add Web API controller4 Web.config will be modified accordingly by VS5 Add Application_Start(){} method if not there already6 Add the following class (I added in global.asax.cs file)7 Modify web api method accordingly8 Rebuild and testBuild a simple html pageAs soon as you add a "WebApi Controller" under controllers folder, Visual Studio takes care of dependencies automatically;Visual Studio has added the full set of dependencies for ASP.NET Web\n  API 2 to project \'MyTestProject\'. The Global.asax.cs file in the project may require additional changes\n  to enable ASP.NET Web API.Add the following namespace references:using System.Web.Http;\n  using System.Web.Routing;If the code does not already define an Application_Start method, add the following method:protected void Application_Start()\n  {\n  }Add the following lines to the beginning of the Application_Start method:GlobalConfiguration.Configure(WebApiConfig.Register);You can install from nuget as the the below image:Or, run the below command line on Package Manager Console:Before you start merging MVC and Web API projects I would suggest to read about cons and pros to separate these as different projects. One very important thing (my own) is authentication systems, which is totally different.IF you need to use authenticated requests on both MVC and Web API, you need to remember that Web API is RESTful (don\'t need to keep session, simple HTTP requests, etc.), but MVC is not.To look on the differences of implementations simply create 2 different projects in Visual Studio 2013 from Templates: one for MVC and one for Web API (don\'t forget to turn On "Individual Authentication" during creation). You will see a lot of difference in AuthencationControllers.So, be aware.The above solution works perfectly. I prefer to choose Web API option while selecting the project template as shown in the picture belowNote: The solution works with Visual Studio 2013 or higher. The original question was asked in in 2012 and it is 2016, therefore adding a solution Visual Studio 2013 or higher.
