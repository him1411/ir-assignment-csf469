ProblemHow do you create a shallow copy with git-svn from a Subversion repository, i.e. how do you pull only the last three revisions?The git clone command can get the last n revisions from a Git repository if you use the option --depth, i.e. you get a shallow copy of the repository. Example:Is there a similar option for git-svn?My discoveries so farSo far I\'ve only found the -rN option where N is the revision to pull. Example:According to the documentation there is the possibility to use -r$REVNUMBER:HEAD. I tried the following to get the last 3 revisions which returned an error message.So I replaced HEAD~3 with the actual number of the third but last revision 534. That worked, but that requires me to first figure out the revision number of the third but last commit.Documentationgit-clonegit-svnYou\'ve already discovered the simplest way to specify a shallow clone in Git-SVN, by specifying the SVN revision number that you want to start your clone at  ( -r$REV:HEAD). For example: git svn clone -s -r1450:HEAD some/svn/repoGit\'s data structure is based on pointers in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which makes it trivial to walk back n commits.  But in SVN ( and therefore in Git-SVN) you will have to find  the revision number yourself.I find myself using the following often to get a limited number of revisions out of our huge subversion tree (we\'re soon reaching svn revision 35000).And a good way to find out where a branch started is to do a svn log it and find the first one on the branch (the last one listed when doing):So far I have not really found the hassle worth it in tracking all branches. It takes too much time to clone and svn and git don\'t work together as good as I would like.    I tend to create patch files and apply them on the git clone of another svn branch.... 7 years later, in the desert, a tumbleweed blows by ...I wasn\'t satisfied with the accepted answer so I created some scripts to do this for you available on Github.  These should help anyone who wants to use git svn clone but doesn\'t want to clone the entire repository and doesn\'t want to hunt for a specific revision to clone from in the middle of the history (maybe you\'re cloning a bunch of repos).  Here we can just clone the last N revisions:Use git svn clone to clone the last 50 revisionsFind the previous N revision from an SVN repo
