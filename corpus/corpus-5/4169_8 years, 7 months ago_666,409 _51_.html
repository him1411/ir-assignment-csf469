When I compile the Python code below, I get IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation levelWhy?Other posters are probably correct...there might be spaces mixed in with your tabs. Try doing a search & replace to replace all tabs with a few spaces.Try this:IMPORTANT:\nSpaces are the preferred method - see PEP008 Indentation and Tabs or Spaces?. (Thanks to @Siha for this.)For Sublime Text users:Set Sublime Text to use tabs for indentation:\nView --> Indentation --> Convert Indentation to TabsUncheck the Indent Using Spaces option as well in the same sub-menu above.\nThis will immediately resolve this issue.To easily check for problems with tabs/spaces you can actually do this:or you can just set up your editor correctly of course :-)Are you sure you are not mixing tabs and spaces in your indentation white space? (That will cause that error.)Note, it is recommended that you don\'t use tabs in Python code. See the style guide. You should configure Notepad++ to insert spaces for tabs.Whenever I\'ve encountered this error, it\'s because I\'ve somehow mixed up tabs and spaces in my editor.  If you use Python\'s IDLE editor you can do as it suggests in one of similar error messages:1) select all, e.g. Ctrl + A2) Go to Format -> Untabify Region3) Double check your indenting is still correct, save and rerun your program.I\'m using Python 2.5.4The line: result = result * i should be indented (it is the body of the for-loop).Or - you have mixed space and tab charactersLooks to be an indentation problem. You don\'t have to match curly brackets in Python but you do have to match indentation levels.The best way to prevent space/tab problems is to display invisible characters within your text  editor. This will give you a quick way to prevent and/or resolve indentation-related errors.Also, injecting copy-pasted code is a common source for this type of problem.If you use notepad++, do a "replace" with extended search mode to find \\t and replace with four spaces.If you are using Vim, hit escape and then type gg=GThis auto indents everything and will clear up any spaces you have thrown in.On Atomgo to Then check again your file indentation:orI had the same issue yesterday, it was indentation error, was using sublime text editor. took my hours trying to fix it and at the end I ended up copying the code into VI text editor and it just worked fine. ps python is too whitespace sensitive, make sure not to mix space and tab.for Atom Users, Packages ->whitspace -> remove trailing whitespaces \nthis worked for me Just a addition. I had a similar problem with the both indentations in Notepad++.Outer Indentation LevelGo to ----> Search tab ----> tap on replace ----> hit the radio button Extended below ---> Now replace \\t with four spacesGo to ----> Search tab ----> tap on replace ----> hit the radio button Extended below ---> Now replace \\n with nothingIt could be because the function above it is not indented the same way.\ni.e.This is because there is a mix-up of both tabs and spaces.\nYou can either remove all the spaces and replace them with tabs.Or,\nTry writing this:at the beginning of the code. This line resolves any differences between tabs and spaces.in my case, the problem was the configuration of pydev on EclipseIf you use Komodo editor you can do as it suggests in one of similar error messages:1) select all, e.g. Ctrl + A2) Go to Code -> Untabify Region3) Double check your indenting is still correct, save and rerun your program.I\'m using Python 3.4.2If you are using Sublime text for python development,you can avoid the error by using the package Anaconda.After installing Anaconda,After setting up your editor following pep8, you still have problems.\nA good trick to solve this is replacing your four spaces by one tab. Actually python does not support 4 spaces in place of 1 tab.
