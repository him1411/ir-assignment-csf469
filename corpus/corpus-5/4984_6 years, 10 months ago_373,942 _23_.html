Just like C, you can break a long line into multiple short lines. But in Python, if I do this, there will be an indent error... Is it possible?From PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code:The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python\'s implied line\n  continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces.  If necessary, you\n  can add an extra pair of parentheses around an expression, but sometimes\n  using a backslash looks better.  Make sure to indent the continued line\n  appropriately.  Example of implicit line continuation:On the topic of line-breaks around a binary operator, it goes on to say:-For decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators.\n  But this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get scattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is moved away from its operand and onto the previous line.In Python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary operator, as long as the convention is consistent locally. For new code Knuth\'s style (line breaks before the operator) is suggested.Example of explicit line continuation:There is more than one way to do it.1). A long statement:2). Using parenthesis:3). Using \\ again:Quoting PEP8:The preferred way of wrapping long\n  lines is by using Python\'s implied\n  line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces.  If necessary,\n  you can add an extra pair of parentheses around an expression, but\n  sometimes using a backslash looks better.  Make sure to indent the continued line\n  appropriately. The preferred place to break around a binary\n  operator is after the operator, not before it.It works in Python too:If you want to assign a long str to variable, you can do it as below:Do not add any comma, or you will get a tuple which contains many strs!As far as I know, it can be done. Python has implicit line continuation (inside parentheses, brackets, and strings) for triple-quoted strings ("""like this""")and the indentation of continuation lines is not important. For more info, you may want to read this article on lexical analysis, from python.org.When trying to enter continuous text (say, a query) do not put commas at the end of the line or you will get a list of strings instead of one long string:kinda like that.There is a comment like this from acgtyrant, sorry, didn\'t see that. :/DB related code looks easier on the eyes in multiple lines, enclosed by a pair of triple quotes:than the following one giant long line:
