What can I do in Eclipse\'s Android emulator to connect it to my localhost web server page at http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1?I\'ve tried it, but the emulator still takes my request like a Google search for localhost or worse it says that it didn\'t found the page while my web server is normally running.The localhost refers to the device on which the code is running, in this case the emulator.If you want to refer to the computer which is running the Android simulator, use the IP address 10.0.2.2 instead. You can read more from here.Use 10.0.2.2 for default AVD and 10.0.3.2 for genymotion.I used 10.0.2.2 successfully on my home machine, but at work, it did not work. After hours of fooling around, I created a new emulator instance using the Android Virtual Device (AVD) manager, and finally the 10.0.2.2 worked. I don\'t know what was wrong with the other emulator instance (the platform was the same), but if you find 10.0.2.2 does not work, try creating a new emulator instance.Try http://10.0.2.2:8080/ where 8080 is your port number.  It worked perfectly. If you just try 10.0.2.2 it won\'t work. You need to add port number to it. Also if Microsoft IIS has been installed try turning off that feature from control panel (if using any windows os) and then try as given above.For My Mac OS mountain Lion device :http:// 10.0.2.2:8888Works perfect !If you are in windows you can go to simbol system and write ipconfig and check what ip is assigned to your machine.according to documentation:10.0.2.2  - Special alias to your host loopback interface (i.e., 127.0.0.1 on your development machine)check Emulator Networking for more tricks on emulator networking.Another workaround is to get a free domain from no-ip.org and point it to your local ip address.\nThen, instead of using http://localhost/yourwebservice you can try http://yourdomain.no-ip.org/yourwebserviceI do not know, maybe this topic is already solved, but when I have tried recently do this on Windows machine, I have faced with lot of difficulties.\nSo my solution was really simple. I have downloaded this soft \nhttp://www.lenzg.net/rinetd/rinetd.html followed their instructions about how to make port forwarding and then successfully my android device connected to make asp.net localhost project and stopped on my breaking point.my rinetd.conf file: Where 10.1.1.20 is my localhost ip, 82 and 1234 my ports \nAlso I have craeted bath file \nfor easy life yournameofbathfile.bat, put that file inside rinedfolder. My bath file:After starting this soft, start your aps.net server and try to access from android device or any device in your local network(for example Computer ABC  starts putty) and you will see that everything works. No need to go to router setting or do any other complicated things.\nI hope this will help you. Enjoy.
