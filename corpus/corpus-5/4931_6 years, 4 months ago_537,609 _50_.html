I am using a Direct Web Remoting (DWR) JavaScript library file and am getting an error only in Safari (desktop and iPad)It says Maximum call stack size exceeded.What exactly does this error mean and does it stop processing completely?Also any fix for Safari browser (Actually on the iPad Safari, it says JS:execution exceeded timeoutwhich I am assuming is the same call stack issue)It means that somewhere in your code, you are calling a function which in turn calls another function and so forth, until you hit the call stack limit.This is almost always because of a recursive function with a base case that isn\'t being met.Consider this code...Here is the stack after a handful of calls...As you can see, the call stack grows until it hits a limit: the browser hardcoded stack size or memory exhaustion.In order to fix it, ensure that your recursive function has a base case which is able to be met...You can sometimes get this if you accidentally import/embed the same JS file twice, worth checking in your resources tab of the inspector :)There is a recursive loop somewhere in your code (i.e. a function that eventually calls itself again and again until the stack is full).Other browsers either have bigger stacks (so you get a timeout instead) or they swallow the error for some reason (maybe a badly placed try-catch).Use the debugger to check the call stack when the error happens.In my case, I was sending input elements instead of their values:Instead of:This froze my Chrome tab to a point it did even show me the \'Wait/Kill\' dialog for when the page becomes unresponsive...Check the error details in the Chrome dev toolbar console, this will give you the functions in the call stack, and guide you towards the recursion that\'s causing the error.If you need a infinite process/recursion running for some reason, you can use a webworker in a seperate thread.\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/workers/basics/if you want to manipulate dom elements and redraw, use animation\nhttp://creativejs.com/resources/requestanimationframe/In my case, I was converting a large byte array into a string using the following:bytes contained several million entries, which is too big to fit on the stack.In my case click event was propagating on child element. So, I had to put e.stopProgration()on click event.Here is the html codeBoth invocations of the identical code below if decreased by 1 work in Chrome 32 on my computer e.g. 17905 vs 17904. If run as is they will produce the error "RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded". It appears to be this limit is not hardcoded but dependant on the hardware of your machine. It does appear that if invoked as a function this self-imposed limit is higher than if invoked as a method i.e. this particular code uses less memory when invoked as a function.Invoked as a method:Invoked as a function:you can find your recursive function in crome browser,press ctrl+shift+j and then source tab, which gives you code compilation flow and you can find using break point in code.In my case, two jQuery modals were showing stacked on top of each other. Preventing that solved my problem. The problem with detecting stackoverflows is sometimes the stack trace will unwind and you won\'t be able to see what\'s actually going on.I\'ve found some of Chrome\'s newer debugging tools useful for this.Hit the Performance tab, make sure Javascript samples are enabled and you\'ll get something like this.It\'s pretty obvious where the overflow is here! If you click on extendObject you\'ll be able to actually see the exact line number in the code. You can also see timings which may or may not be helpful or a red herring.Another useful trick if you can\'t actually find the problem is to put lots of console.log statements where you think the problem is. The previous step above can help you with this.In Chrome if you repeatedly output identical data it will display it like this showing where the problem is more clearly. In this instance the stack hit 7152 frames before it finally crashed:I also faced similar issue here is the details\n when uploading logo using dropdown logo upload boxCSS.cssThe error in console: I solved it by removing onclick="$(\'#filePhoto\').click()" from div tag.
