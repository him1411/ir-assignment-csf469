In eclipse there is a shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F that re-indents code and fixes comments and blank lines. Is there an equivalent for Visual Studio 2010?Visual Studio WITH C# KEY BINDINGSTo answer the specific question, in C# you are likely to be using the C# keyboard mapping scheme, which will use these hotkeys by default:Ctrl+E, Ctrl+D to format the entire document.Ctrl+E, Ctrl+F to format the selection.You can change these in Tools > Options > Environment -> Keyboard (either by selecting a different "keyboard mapping scheme", or binding individual keys to the commands "Edit.FormatDocument" and "Edit.FormatSelection").If you have not chosen to use the C# keyboard mapping scheme, then you may find the key shortcuts are different. For example, if you are not using the C# bindings, the keys are likely to be:Ctrl + K + D (Entire document)Ctrl + K + F (Selection only)To find out which key bindings apply in YOUR copy of Visual Studio, look in the Edit > Advanced menu - the keys are displayed to the right of the menu items, so it\'s easy to discover what they are on your system.(Please do not edit this answer to change the key bindings above to what your system has!)Ctrl + K + D (Entire document)Ctrl + K + F (Selection only)try Ctrl + K + D ("don\'t leave Ctrl in between")Yes, you can use the two-chord hotkey (Ctrl+K, Ctrl+F if you\'re using the General profile) to format your selection.Other formatting options are under Edit \xc2\xbb Advanced, and like all VS commands, you can set your own hotkey via Tools \xc2\xbb Options \xc2\xbb Environment \xc2\xbb Keyboard (the format selection command is called Edit.FormatSelection).Formatting doesn\'t do anything with blank lines, but it will indent your code according to some rules that are usually slightly off from what you probably want.resharper - Ctrl + Alt + FVS 2010 - Ctrl + K, Ctrl + DTo align the text in proper format =Ctrl + K + D for front end pages like .aspx or .cshtmlCtrl + K + F for .cs pagebut note that press all buttons in sequence accordingly.. Format the entire document: \nctrl + k + dSelect all document and press Ctrl + E + D
