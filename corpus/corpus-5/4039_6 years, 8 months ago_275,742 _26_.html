How do I send an intent using Android\'s ADB tools?Or you can use this directly:You can also specify actions to be filter by your intent-filters:It\'s possible to run application specifying package name only using monkey tool by follow this pattern:Command is used to run app using monkey tool which generates random input for application. The  last part of command is integer which specify the number of generated random input for app. In this case the number is 1, which in fact is used to launch the app (icon click).Or, you could use this: linux/mac users can also create a script to run an apk with something like the following:create a file named "adb-run.sh" with these 3 lines:then "chmod +x adb-run.sh" to make it executable.now you can simply:adb-run.sh myapp.apkThe benefit here is that you don\'t need to know the package name or launchable activity name. Similarly, you can create "adb-uninstall.sh myapp.apk"Note: This requires that you have aapt in your path. You can find it under the new build tools folder in the SDK. Also, I want to mention one more thing.When you start an application from adb shell am, it automatically adds FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag which makes behavior change. See the code.For example, if you launch Play Store activity from adb shell am, pressing \'Back\' button(hardware back button) wouldn\'t take you your app, instead it would take you previous Play Store activity if there was some(If there was not Play store task, then it would take you your app). FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK documentation says :if a task is already running for the activity you are now starting, then a new activity will not be started; instead, the current task will simply be brought to the front of the screen with the state it was last inThis caused me to spend a few hours to find out what went wrong.So, keep in mind that adb shell am add FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag.open ~/.bash_profile\nand add these bash functions to the end of the filethen open the Android project folder We can as well start an application by knowing application type and feeding it with data:This command displays available Video Players to play sample.3gp fileTry this, here i am opening android photo app & giving specific file to open as parameter.adb shell am start -n com.google.android.apps.photos/.home.HomeActivity -d file:///mnt/user/0/primary/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot.pngIt will work on latest android, no pop up will come to select an application to open as you are giving specific app to which you want to open your image with
