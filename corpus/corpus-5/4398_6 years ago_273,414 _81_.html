I\'m deploying a Django app to a dev server and am hitting this error when i run pip install requirements.txt:pkg_resources appears to be distributed with setuptools.  Initially I thought this might not be installed to the python in the virtualenv so I installed setuptools (2.6, same version as Python) to the Python site-packages in the virtualenv with the following commandEDIT\nThis only happens inside the virtualenv.  If I open a console outside the virtualenv then pkg_resources is presentbut I am still getting the same error.  Any ideas as to why pkg_resources is not on the path?I encountered the same ImportError today while trying to use pip. Somehow the setuptools package had been deleted in my Python environment.To fix the issue, run the setup script for setuptools:(or if you don\'t have wget installed (e.g. OS X), trypossibly with sudo prepended.)If you have any version of distribute, or any setuptools below 0.6, you will have to uninstall it first.*See Installation Instructions for further details.* If you already have a working distribute, upgrading it to the "compatibility wrapper" that switches you over to setuptools is easier. But if things are already broken, don\'t try that.fixed it for me in Debian. Seems like uninstalling some .deb packages (twisted set in my case) has broken the path python uses to find packages I have seen this error while trying to install rhodecode to a virtualenv on ubuntu 13.10. For me the solution was to run before I run easy_install rhodecode.It also happened to me. I think the problem will happen if the requirements.txt contains a "distribute" entry while the virtualenv uses setuptools. Pip will try to patch setuptools to make room for distribute, but unfortunately it will fail half way.The easy solution is delete your current virtualenv then make a new virtualenv with --distribute argument.An example if using virtualenvwrapper:I had this error earlier and the highest rated answer gave me an error trying to download the ez_setup.py file. I found another source so you can run the command:I found that I also had to use sudo to get it working, so you may need to run:I\'ve also created another location that the script can be downloaded from:https://gist.github.com/ajtrichards/42e73562a89edb1039f3In CentOS 6 installing the package python-setuptools fixed it.Needed a little bit more sudo. Then used easy_install to install pip. Works.I fixed the error with virtualenv by doing this:Copied pkg_resources.py from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/setuptoolsto /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/This may be a cheap workaround, but it worked for me..If setup tools doesn\'t exist, you can try installing system-site-packages by typing virtualenv --system-site-packages /DESTINATION DIRECTORY, changing the last part to be the directory you want to install to. pkg_rousources.py will be under that directory in lib/python2.7/site-packagesFor me, this error was being caused because I had a subdirectory called "site"!  I don\'t know if this is a pip bug or not, but I started with:/some/dir/requirements.txt\n/some/dir/site/pip install -r requirements.txt wouldn\'t work, giving me the above error!renaming the subfolder from "site" to "src" fixed the problem!  Maybe pip is looking for "site-packages"?  Crazy.I had this problem when I had activated my virtualenv as a different user than the one who created it. It seems to be a permission problem. I discovered this when I tried the answer by @cwc and saw this in the output: Switching back to the user that created the virtualenv, then running the original pip install command went without problems. Hope this helps!I had this problem today as well. I only got the problem inside the virtual env. The solution for me was deactivating the virtual env, deleting and then uninstalling virtualenv with pip and reinstalling it. After that I created a new virtual env for my project, then pip worked fine both inside the virtual environment as in the normal environment.Looks like they have moved away from bitbucket and are now on github (https://github.com/pypa/setuptools)Command to run is:For me, it turned out to be a permissions problem on site-packages. Since it\'s only my dev environment, I raised the permissions and everything is working again:Apparently you\'re missing setuptools. Some virtualenv versions use distribute instead of setuptools by default. Use the --setuptools option when creating the virtualenv or set the VIRTUALENV_SETUPTOOLS=1 in your environment.I came across this answer when I was trying to follow this guide for OSX. What worked for me was, after running python get-pip, I had to ALSO easy_install pip. That fixed the issue of not being able to run pip at all. I did have a bunch of old macport stuff installed. That may have conflicted.On windows, I installed pip downloaded from www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ then encontered this problem. So I should have installed setuptools(easy_install) first.just reinstall your setuptools by :then everything will be fine.I use CentOS 6.7, and my python was just upgrade from 2.6.6 to 2.7.11, after tried so many different answer, finally the following one does the job:Hope help someone in the same situation.None of the posted answers worked for me, so I reinstalled pip and it worked!(reference: http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2010/02/how-install-pip-ubuntu/)I ran into this problem after updating my Ubuntu build.  It seems to have gone through and removed set up tools in all of my virtual environments.To remedy this I reinstalled the virtual environment back into the target directory.  This cleaned up missing setup tools and got things running again.e.g.:For me a good fix was to use --no-download option to virtualenv (VIRTUALENV_NO_DOWNLOAD=1 tox for tox.)On Opensuse 42.1 the following fixed this issue:ImportError: No module named pkg_resources: the solution is to reinstall python pip using the following  Command are under.Step: 1 Login in root user.Step: 2 Uninstall python-pip package if existing.Step: 3 Download files using wget command(File download in pwd )Step: 4 Run python file.Step: 5 Finaly exicute installation  command.  Note: User must be root.I experienced that error in my Google App Engine environment. And pip install -t lib setuptools fixed the issue.After trying several of these answers, then reaching out to a colleague, what worked for me on Ubuntu 16.04 was:In my case, it was only an old version of pillow 3.1.1 that was having trouble (pillow 4.x worked fine), and that\'s now resolved!The following solution proposed by Tukadiya Ramesh worked for me however I want to point out that you must use correct binaries/tools matching your environment, like for me I have python3.6 (python 3) installed:ImportError: No module named pkg_resources: the solution is to reinstall python pip using the following Command are under.Step: 1 Login in root user.sudo su root Step: 2 Uninstall python-pip package if existing.apt-get purge -y python-pip (use python3-pip if error is pointing to ../python3/..)Step: 3 Download files using wget command(File download in pwd )wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py (there is version 3.2 available, use that according to your env)Step: 4 Run python file.python ./get-pip.py (if error is related to python 3 then you want to use python3 or python3.6 etc. [as per your env.])Step: 5 Finaly execute installation command.apt-get install python-pip (again, use python3-pip as in step 2)Note: User must be root.P.S. this solved issue with my update-manager in Ubuntu 16. It kept on crashing with errors related to Python import. If you are having same issue try running sudo aptd, if it throws error (sorry I dont have exact) related to Python then you are facing same problem as me.
