If I have a list of chars:How do I convert it into a single string?Use the join method of the empty string to join all of the strings together with the empty string in between, like so:This works in JavaScript or Ruby, why not in Python?But in Python the join method is on the str class:It is a little weird, isn\'t it? Why join is not a method in the list object like in JavaScript or other popular script languages? It is one example of how the Python community thinks. Since join is returning a string, it should be placed in the string class, not on the list class, so the str.join(list) method means: join the list into a new string using str as a separator (in this case str is an empty string). Somehow I got to love this way of thinking after a while. I can complain about a lot of things in Python design, but not about its coherence.This may be the fastest way:If your Python interpreter is old (1.5.2, for example, which is common on some older Linux distributions), you may not have join() available as a method on any old string object, and you will instead need to use the string module. Example:The string b will be \'abcd\'.The reduce function also worksuse join with empty separatoror use reduce with add operatorYou could also use operator.concat() like this:If you\'re using Python 3 you need to prepend:since the builtin reduce() has been removed from Python 3 and now lives in functools.reduce(). If the list contains numbers, you can use map() with join().Eg:
