I am trying to use HTML5 data- attributes in my ASP.NET MVC 1 project. (I am a C# and ASP.NET MVC newbie.)The "data-details" in the above htmlAttributes give the following error:It works when I use data_details, but I guess it need to be starting with "data-" as per the spec.My questions:Update: MVC 3 and newer versions have built-in support for this. See JohnnyO\'s highly upvoted answer below for recommended solutions.I do not think there are any immediate helpers for achieving this, but I do have two ideas for you to try:Just ideas, haven\'t tested it.This problem has been addressed in ASP.Net MVC 3.  They now automatically convert underscores in html attribute properties to dashes.  They got lucky on this one, as underscores are not legal in html attributes, so MVC can confidently imply that you\'d like a dash when you use an underscore.For example:will render this in MVC 3:If you\'re still using an older version of MVC, you can mimic what MVC 3 is doing by creating this static method that I borrowed from MVC3\'s source code:And then you can use it like this:and this will render the correct data-* attribute:It\'s even easier than everything suggested above.\nData attributes in MVC which include dashes (-) are catered for with the use of underscore (_).I see JohnnyO already mentioned this.In mvc 4 Could be rendered with Underscore(" _ ")Razor:Rendered HtmlYou can implement this with a new Html helper extension function which will then be used similarly to the existing ActionLinks.And you call it like so ...Simples :-)editbit more of a write up hereI ended up using a normal hyperlink along with Url.Action, as in:It\'s uglier, but you\'ve got a little more control over the a tag, which is sometimes useful in heavily AJAXified sites.HTHI do not like use pure "a" tag, too much typing. So I come with solution.\nIn view it lookImplementation of Dic classYou can use it like this:In Mvc:In Html:
