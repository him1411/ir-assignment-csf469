I am using express 4.0 and I\'m aware that body parser has been taken out of the express core, I am using the recommended replacement, however I am getting body-parser deprecated bodyParser: use individual json/urlencoded middlewares server.js:15:12\nbody-parser deprecated urlencoded: explicitly specify "extended: true" for extended parsing node_modules/body-parser/index.js:74:29Where do I find this supposed middlewares? or should I not be getting this error?It means that using the bodyParser() constructor has been deprecated,  as of 2014-06-19.You now need to call the methods separatelyAnd so on.If you\'re still getting a warning with urlencoded you need to useThe extended config object key now needs to be explicitly passed, since it now has no default value.Want zero warnings? Use it like this:Explanation: The default value of the extended option has been deprecated, meaning you need to explicitly pass true or false value.In older versions of express, we had to use:because express was a middleware between node and \nbody-parser. Now we have to use it like:body-parser is a piece of express middleware that \n         reads a form\'s input and stores it as a javascript\n          object accessible through req.body \n        \'body-parser\' must be installed (via npm install --save body-parser) For more info see: https://github.com/expressjs/body-parserWhen extended is set to true, then deflated (compressed) bodies will be inflated; when extended is set to false, deflated bodies are rejected. I found that while addinghelps, sometimes it\'s a matter of your querying that determines how express handles it. For instance, it could be that your parameters are passed in the URL rather than in the bodyIn such a case, you need to capture both the body and url parameters and use whichever is available (with preference for the body parameters in the case below)What is your opinion to use express-generator it will generate skeleton project to start with, without deprecated messages appeared in your log run this command Now, create new Express.js starter application by type this command in your Node projects folder.That command tell express to generate new Node.js application with the name node-express-app.then Go to the newly created project directory, install npm packages and start the app using the command
