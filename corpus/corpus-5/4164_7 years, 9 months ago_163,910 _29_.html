My app shows a signup activity the first time the user runs the app, looks like:so the activities launch each other in exactly that order, when the user clicks through a button on each screen.When the user goes from activity #2 to #3, is it possible to wipe #1 and #2 off the history stack completely? I\'d like it so that if the user is at #3, and hits the back button, they just go to the homescreen, instead of back to the splash screen.I think I can accomplish this with tasks (ie. start a new task on #3) but wanted to see if there was simpler method,ThanksYou can achieve this by setting the android:noHistory attribute to "true" in the relevant <activity> entries in your AndroidManifest.xml file. For example:You can use forwarding to remove the previous activity from the activity stack while launching the next one.  There\'s an example of this in the APIDemos, but basically all you\'re doing is calling finish() immediately after calling startActivity().Yes, have a look at Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY.This is likely not the ideal way to do it. If someone has a better way, I will be looking forward to implementing it. Here\'s how I accomplished this specific task with pre-version-11 sdk.in each class you want to go away when it\'s clear time, you need to do this:then the one that needs to set off the chain of pops from the stack needs to just call this when you want to initiate it:Then the activities aren\'t on the stack!\nRemember folks, that you can start an activity, and then begin cleaning up behind it, execution does not follow a single (the ui) thread.One way that works pre API 11 is to start ActivityGameMain first, then in the onCreate of that Activity start your ActivitySplashScreen activity. The ActivityGameMain won\'t appear as you call startActivity too soon for the splash.Then you can clear the stack when starting ActivityGameMain by setting these flags on the Intent:You also must add this to ActivitySplashScreen:So that pressing back on that activity doesn\'t go back to your ActivityGameMain.I assume you don\'t want the splash screen to be gone back to either, to achieve this I suggest setting it to noHistory in your AndroidManifest.xml. Then put the goBackPressed code in your ActivitySplashScreenSignUp class instead.However I have found a few ways to break this. Start another app from a notification while ActivitySplashScreenSignUp is shown and the back history is not reset.The only real way around this is in API 11:I use this way.I know I\'m late on this (it\'s been two years since the question was asked) but I accomplished this by intercepting the back button press. Rather than checking for specific activities, I just look at the count and if it\'s less than 3 it simply sends the app to the back (pausing the app and returning the user to whatever was running before launch). I check for less than three because I only have one intro screen. Also, I check the count because my app allows the user to navigate back to the home screen through the menu, so this allows them to back up through other screens like normal if there are activities other than the intro screen on the stack.Just set noHistory="true" in Manifest file.\nIt makes activity being removed from the backstack.for API >= 15 to API 23\nother solution not works in my case . finally i get this one.In the manifest you can add:You can also callimmediately after calling startActivity(..) Try this:intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCHED_FROM_HISTORY)it is API Level 1, check the link.
