How do I properly set the default character encoding used by the JVM (1.5.x) programmatically?I have read that -Dfile.encoding=whatever used to be the way to go for older JVMs... I don\'t have that luxury for reasons I wont get into.I have tried:And the property gets set, but it doesn\'t seem to cause the final getBytes call below to use UTF8:Unfortunately, the file.encoding property has to be specified as the JVM starts up; by the time your main method is entered, the character encoding used by String.getBytes() and the default constructors of InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter has been permanently cached.As Edward Grech points out, in a special case like this, the environment variable JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS can be used to specify this property, but it\'s normally done like this:Charset.defaultCharset() will reflect changes to the file.encoding property, but most of the code in the core Java libraries that need to determine the default character encoding do not use this mechanism.When you are encoding or decoding, you can query the file.encoding property or Charset.defaultCharset() to find the current default encoding, and use the appropriate method or constructor overload to specify it.From the JVM\xe2\x84\xa2 Tool Interface documentation\xe2\x80\xa6Since the command-line cannot always be accessed or modified, for example in embedded VMs or simply VMs launched deep within scripts, a JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS variable is provided so that agents may be launched in these cases.By setting the (Windows) environment variable JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS to -Dfile.encoding=UTF8, the (Java) System property will be set automatically every time a JVM is started. You will know that the parameter has been picked up because the following message will be posted to System.err:Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -Dfile.encoding=UTF8I have a hacky way that definitely works!!This way you are going to trick JVM which would think that charset is not set and make it to set it again to UTF-8, on runtime!I think a better approach than setting the platform\'s default character set, especially as you seem to have restrictions on affecting the application deployment, let alone the platform, is to call the much safer String.getBytes("charsetName"). That way your application is not dependent on things beyond its control.I personally feel that String.getBytes() should be deprecated, as it has caused serious problems in a number of cases I have seen, where the developer did not account for the default charset possibly changing.I can\'t answer your original question but I would like to offer you some advice -- don\'t depend on the JVM\'s default encoding.  It\'s always best to explicitly specify the desired encoding (i.e. "UTF-8") in your code.  That way, you know it will work even across different systems and JVM configurations.Try this : We were having the same issues.  We methodically tried several suggestions from this article (and others) to no avail.  We also tried adding the -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 and nothing seemed to be working.  For people that are having this issue, the following article finally helped us track down describes how the locale setting can break unicode/UTF-8 in Java/Tomcathttp://www.jvmhost.com/articles/locale-breaks-unicode-utf-8-java-tomcatSetting the locale correctly in the ~/.bashrc file worked for us.Not clear on what you do and don\'t have control over at this point. If you can interpose a different OutputStream class on the destination file, you could use a subtype of OutputStream which converts Strings to bytes under a charset you define, say UTF-8 by default. If modified UTF-8 is suffcient for your needs, you can use DataOutputStream.writeUTF(String):If this approach is not feasible, it may help if you clarify here exactly what you can and can\'t control in terms of data flow and execution environment (though I know that\'s sometimes easier said than determined). Good luck.I have tried a lot of things, but the sample code here works perfect.\nLinkThe crux of the code is:We set there two system properties together and it makes the system take everything into utf8
