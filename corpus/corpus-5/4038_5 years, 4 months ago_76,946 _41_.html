I\'d like to merge two blocks of lines in Vim, i.e. take lines n..m and append them to lines a..b. If you prefer a pseudocode explanation: [a[i] + b[i] for i in min(len(a), len(b))]Example: should becomeIs there a nice way to do this without doing copy&paste manually?You can certainly do all this with a single copy/paste (using block-mode selection), but I\'m guessing that\'s not what you want.If you want to do this with just Ex commandswill transformintoUPDATE: An answer with this many upvotes deserves a more thorough explanation.In Vim, you can use the pipe character (|) to chain multiple Ex commands, so the above is equivalent toMany Ex commands accept a range of lines as a prefix argument - in the above case the 5,8 before the del and the 1,4 before the s/// specify which lines the commands operate on.del deletes the given lines.  It can take a register argument, but when one is not given, it dumps the lines to the unnamed register, @", just like deleting in normal mode does.  let l=split(@") then splits the deleted lines into a list, using the default delimiter: whitespace.  To work properly on input that had whitespace in the deleted lines, like:we\'d need to specify a different delimiter, to prevent "work is" from being split into two list elements: let l=split(@","\\n").Finally, in the substitution s/$/\\=remove(l,0)/, we replace the end of each line ($) with the value of the expression remove(l,0).  remove(l,0) alters the list l, deleting and returning its first element. This lets us replace the deleted lines in the order in which we read them. We could instead replace the deleted lines in reverse order by using remove(l,-1).An elegant and concise Ex command solving the issue can be obtained by\ncombining the :global, :move, and :join commands.  Assuming that the\nfirst block of lines starts on the first line of the buffer, and that the\ncursor is located on the line immediately preceding the first line of the\nsecond block, the command is as follows.For detailed explanation of the technique used, see the answer I gave to\nthe question "Vim paste -d \' \' behavior out of the box?".To join blocks of line, you have to do the following steps:The movement is not the best one (I\'m not an expert), but it works like you wanted. Hope there will be a shorter version of it.Here are the prerequisits so this technique works well:Here\'s how I\'d do it (with the cursor on the first line):You need to know two things:Here\'s what\'s going on:As mentioned elsewhere, block selection is the way to go. But you can also use any variant of::!tail -n -6 % | paste -d \'\\0\' % - | head -n 5This method relies on the UNIX command line. The paste utility was created to handle this sort of line merging.Sample data is the same as rampion\'s.I wouldn\'t think make it too complicated.\nI would just set virtualedit on\n(:set virtualedit=all)\nSelect block 123 and all below.\nPut it after the first column:  and remove the multiple space between to 1 space:I would use complex repeats :)Given this:With the cursor at the first "a" in the first line, press the following:and then press @q (and you may subsequently use @@) as many times as needed.You should end up with:(Plus a newline.)There can be many number of ways to accomplish this. I will merge two blocks of text using any of the following two methods.suppose  first block is at line 1 and 2nd block starts from line 10 with the cursor\'s initial position at line number 1.
