Depending on my task in Vim I have several tabs open.How can I save different sessions for later use?You want something likeThen later you can source that vim file and you\'ll have your old session back:or open vim with the -S option:You might want to set these session options in your vimrc. Especially options is annoying when you\'ve changed your vimrc after you\'ve saved the session.Note that :mksession will not save the changes to any files that you\'ve made. I made this mistake of closing vim after saving the session assuming that I\'ll take up from there. But next time I opened the session, the changes I had made to the files were gone.If you use NERDTree as your file explorer/dash, I would recommend xolox/vim-session plugin instead of the built-in :mksession command. For some reason, :mksession fails to restore NERDTree buffers. Your mileage may vary, but thought I\'d share my experience.If you want to automate the process without using any plugins, you could use Go away and come back from Vim Tips Wiki.Each time you exit Vim it will save the current session under ~/.vim/sessions and load it back again once Vim is opened. It\'s also based on you current path, so if you open Vim from different directories you will have different sessions, which is quite useful when working on different projects.Just edit your ~/.vimrc file and add the following:Even for a beginner this script is somewhat easy to understand and customize.Please note this script will only work properly for Unix systems (MacOS/Linux), it needs to be adapted to work on Windows.UPDATE: Adding 0xc0de\'s suggestion, you may replace the VimEnter line for these ones if you want Vim to load session only if no arguments are provided:There is a very useful plugin for this task vim-startify which handles many other things like recently opened files etc, it has a very easy interface too.I am using it since couple of days and till now its working perfectly. Hope it helps you.There is this wonderful plugin call vim-session. It\'s very powerful. To install it:I have mapped its functionality in my .vimrc file like this:Now in normal mode just type <leader>ss and you will see a command like thisNow add the name of your sessionand that\'s all.When you close Vim and reopen it just doand you will see your session open.There is a lot of other configuration to add in your .vimrc file see the documentation for examples:There is a good tutorial on YouTube.Thanks @mathielo\nFollowing example from @mathielo, I added the below line to .vimrc to save the active session (if any):If you want to put more lines, you need to use endif:You only need to save a new session in vim withand after start withvim will start the session and you don\'t need to worry to save the session every time you close vim. If you don\'t have an active session .vimrc won\'t do anything. As before.That\'s what I was looking for! Thanks again @mathielo!You can store session wherever you want.Ex:This stores the session in D drive.This can be opened by typingin any of the vim files.Below is the only conf. that really worked for me. I took it from here, where you can also take a more complete/complex version.Personally i just wrap over Tim Pope\' s Obsession plugin to allow defining a sessiondir and avoid typing the path:If you plan having only 1 session for the project just dowhich will create a Session.vim file in the current directory, and then to open the session (from the same directory):If you change the session and want to save it:This saves the session, not the files themselves!If you plan having multiple sessions, I prefer to save them in hidden files in the project\'s directory:To open it (from the same directory):Save session:Since the sessions are saved in hidden files, to view them don\'t forget -aFor managing multiple sessions (on a per directory/repo basis), I\'ve recently switched from the vim-session plugin to vim-workspace. Its session management is relatively simple and works pretty well.
