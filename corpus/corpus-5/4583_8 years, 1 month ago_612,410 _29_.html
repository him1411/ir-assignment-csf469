I need to check (from the same table) if there is an association between two events based on date-time.One set of data will contain the ending date-time of certain events and the other set of data will contain the starting date-time for other events.If the first event completes before the second event then I would like to link them up.What I have so far is:Then I join them:Can I then, based on my validation_check field, run a UPDATE query with the SELECT nested?You can actually do this one of two ways:MySQL update join syntax:ANSI SQL syntax:Pick whichever one seems most natural to you.Hope this works for you.Easy in MySQL:If somebody is seeking to update data from one database to another no matter which table they are targeting, there must be some criteria to do it.This one is better and clean for all levels:Traaa! It works great!With above understanding, you can modify the set fields and "on" criteria to do your work. You can also perform the checks, then pull the data into the temp table(s) and then run the update using the above syntax replacing your table and column names. Hope it works, if not let me know. I will write an exact query for you.Hope this will help you in a case where you have to match and update between two tables.I found this question in looking for my own solution to a very complex join.  This is an alternative solution, to a more complex version of the problem, which I thought might be useful.  I needed to populate the product_id field in the activities table, where activities are numbered in a unit, and units are numbered in a level (identified using a string ??N), such that one can identify activities using an SKU ie L1U1A1.  Those SKUs are then stored in a different table.  I identified the following to get a list of activity_id vs product_id:-I found that that was too complex to incorporate into a SELECT within mysql, so I created a temporary table, and joined that with the update statement:-I hope someone finds this usefulYou can update values from another table using inner join like thisFollow here to know how to use this query http://www.voidtricks.com/mysql-inner-join-update/or you can use select as subquery to do thisquery explained in details here http://www.voidtricks.com/mysql-update-from-select/You can use:For same table,
