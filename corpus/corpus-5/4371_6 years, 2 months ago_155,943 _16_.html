I\'m trying to use a constant instead of a string literal in this piece of code:"UTF-8" appears in the code rather often, and would be much better to refer to some static final variable instead. Do you know where I can find such a variable in JDK?BTW, on a second thought, such constants are bad design: Public Static Literals ... Are Not a Solution for Data DuplicationIn Java 1.7+, java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets defines constants for Charset including UTF_8.For Android: minSdk 19Now I use org.apache.commons.lang3.CharEncoding.UTF_8 constant from commons-lang.The Google Guava library (which I\'d highly recommend anyway, if you\'re doing work in Java) has a Charsets class with static fields like Charsets.UTF_8, Charsets.UTF_16, etc.Since Java 7 you should just use java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets instead for comparable constants.Note that these constants aren\'t strings, they\'re actual Charset instances. All standard APIs that take a charset name also have an overload that take a Charset object which you should use instead.In case this page comes up in someones web search, as of Java 1.7 you can now use java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets to get access to constant definitions of standard charsets.There are none (at least in the standard Java library). Character sets vary from platform to platform so there isn\'t a standard list of them in Java.There are some 3rd party libraries which contain these constants though. One of these is Guava (Google core libraries): http://guava-libraries.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Charsets.htmlYou can use Charset.defaultCharset() API or file.encoding property.But if you want your own constant, you\'ll need to define it yourself.This constant is available (among others as: UTF-16, US-ASCII, etc.) in the class org.apache.commons.codec.CharEncoding as well.If you are using OkHttp for Java/Android you can use the following constant:
