I got a simple question in Java: How can I convert a String that was obtained by Long.toString() to long?To convert a String to a Long (object), use Long.valueOf(String s).longValue();See linkLong.valueOf(String s) - obviously due care must be taken to protect against non-numbers if that is possible in your code.The best approach is Long.valueOf(str) as it relies on Long.valueOf(long) which uses an internal cache making it more efficient since it will reuse if needed the cached instances of Long going from -128 to 127 included.Returns a Long instance representing the specified long value. If a\n  new Long instance is not required, this method should generally be\n  used in preference to the constructor Long(long), as this method is\n  likely to yield significantly better space and time performance by\n  caching frequently requested values. Note that unlike the\n  corresponding method in the Integer class, this method is not required\n  to cache values within a particular range.Thanks to auto-unboxing allowing to convert a wrapper class\'s instance into its corresponding primitive type, the code would then be:Please note that the previous code can still throw a NumberFormatException if the provided String doesn\'t match with a signed long.Generally speaking, it is a good practice to use the static factory method valueOf(str) of a wrapper class like Integer, Boolean, Long, ... since most of them reuse instances whenever it is possible making them potentially more efficient in term of memory footprint than the corresponding parse methods or constructors.Excerpt from Effective Java Item 1 written by Joshua Bloch:You can often avoid creating unnecessary objects by using static\n  factory methods (Item 1) in preference to constructors on immutable\n  classes that provide both. For example, the static factory method\n  Boolean.valueOf(String) is almost always preferable to the\n  constructor Boolean(String). The constructor creates a new object\n  each time it\xe2\x80\x99s called, while the static factory method is never\n  required to do so and won\xe2\x80\x99t in practice.In case you are using the Map with out generic, then you need to convert the value into String and then try to convert to Long. Below is sample code
