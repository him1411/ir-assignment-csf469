My regex pattern looks something likeI am only interested in the part in quotes assigned to location. Shouldn\'t it be as easy as below without the greedy switch? Does not seem to work.You need to make your regular expression non-greedy, because by default, "(.*)" will match all of "file path/level1/level2" xxx some="xxx".Instead you can make your dot-star non-greedy, which will make it match as few characters as possible:Adding a ? on a quantifier (?, * or +) makes it non-greedy.location="(.*)" will match from the " after location= until the " after some="xxx unless you make it non-greedy. So you either need .*? (i.e. make it non-greedy) or better replace .* with [^"]*.How aboutThis avoids the unlimited search with .* and will match exactly to the first quote.Use non-greedy matching, if your engine supports it. Add the ? inside the capture.
