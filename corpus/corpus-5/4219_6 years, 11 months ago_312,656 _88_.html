Since this post has gotten a lot of attention over the years, I\'ve listed the top solutions per platform at the bottom of this post.Original post:I want my node.js server to run in the background, i.e.: when I close my terminal I want my server to keep running. I\'ve googled this and came up with this tutorial, however it doesn\'t work as intended. So instead of using that daemon script, I thought I just used the output redirection (the 2>&1 >> file part), but this too does not exit - I get a blank line in my terminal, like it\'s waiting for output/errors.I\'ve also tried to put the process in the background, but as soon as I close my terminal the process is killed as well.So how can I leave it running when I shut down my local computer?Top solutions:Copying my own answer from How do I run a Node.js application as its own process?2015 answer: nearly every Linux distro comes with systemd, which means forever, monit, etc are  no longer necessary - your OS already handles these tasks.Make a myapp.service file (replacing \'myapp\' with your app\'s name, obviously):Copy your service file into the /etc/systemd/system. Start it with systemctl start myapp. Enable it to run on boot with systemctl enable myapp.See logs with journalctl -u myappMore details at: How we deploy node apps on Linux, 2016 editionYou can use Forever, A simple CLI tool for ensuring that a given node script runs continuously (i.e. forever):\nhttps://www.npmjs.org/package/foreverUPDATE - As mentioned in one of the answers below, PM2 has some really nice functionality missing from forever.  Consider using it.Original AnswerUse nohup:EDIT I wanted to add that the accepted answer is really the way to go.  I\'m using forever on instances that need to stay up.  I like to do npm install -g forever so it\'s in the node path and then just do forever start server.js2016 Update:\nThe node-windows/mac/linux series uses a common API across all operating systems, so it is absolutely a relevant solution. However; node-linux generates systemv init files. As systemd continues to grow in popularity, it is realistically a better option on Linux. PR\'s welcome if anyone wants to add systemd support to node-linux :-)Original Thread:This is a pretty old thread now, but node-windows provides another way to create background services on Windows. It is loosely based on the nssm concept of using an exe wrapper around your node script. However; it uses winsw.exe instead and provides a configurable node wrapper for more granular control over how the process starts/stops on failures. These processes are available like any other service:The module also bakes in some event logging:Daemonizing your script is accomplished through code. For example:The module supports things like capping restarts (so bad scripts don\'t hose your server) and growing time intervals between restarts.Since node-windows services run like any other, it is possible to manage/monitor the service with whatever software you already use.Finally, there are no make dependencies. In other words, a straightforward npm install -g node-windows will work. You don\'t need Visual Studio, .NET, or node-gyp magic to install this. Also, it\'s MIT and BSD licensed.In full disclosure, I\'m the author of this module. It was designed to relieve the exact pain the OP experienced, but with tighter integration into the functionality the Operating System already provides. I hope future viewers with this same question find it useful.This might not be the accepted way, but I do it with screen, especially while in development because I can bring it back up and fool with it if necessary.The screen will detach and survive you logging off. Then you can get it back back doing screen -r. Hit up the screen manual for more details. You can name the screens and whatnot if you like.UPDATE: i updated to include the latest from pm2:for many use cases, using a systemd service is the simplest and most appropriate way to manage a node process. for those that are running numerous node processes or independently-running node microservices in a single environment, pm2 is a more full featured tool.https://github.com/unitech/pm2http://pm2.ioI am simply using the daemon npm module:Lately I\'m also using mon(1) from TJ Holowaychuk to start and manage simple node apps.I use Supervisor for development. It just works. When ever you make changes to a .js file Supervisor automatically restarts your app with those changes loaded.Here\'s a link to its Github pageInstall :sudo npm install supervisor -gYou can easily make it watch other extensions with -e. Another command I use often is -i to ignore certain folders.You can use nohup and supervisor to make your node app run in the background even after you log out.sudo nohup supervisor myapp.js &If you are running OSX, then the easiest way to produce a true system process is to use launchd to launch it.Build a plist like this, and put it into the /Library/LaunchDaemons with the name top-level-domain.your-domain.application.plist (you need to be root when placing it):When done, issue this (as root):and you are running.And you will still be running after a restart.For other options in the plist look at the man page here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man5/launchd.plist.5.htmlNode.js as a background service in WINDOWS XPInstallation:Create c:\\node\\helloworld.jsOpen command console and type the following (setx only if Resource Kit is installed)A nifty batch goodie is to create c:\\node\\ServiceMe.cmdService Management:The accepted answer is probably the best production answer, but for a quick hack doing dev work, I found this:nodejs scriptname.js & didn\'t work, because nodejs seemed to gobble up the &, and so the thing didn\'t let me keep using the terminal without scriptname.js dying.But I put nodejs scriptname.js in a .sh file, and\nnohup sh startscriptname.sh & worked.Definitely not a production thing, but it solves the "I need to keep using my terminal and don\'t want to start 5 different terminals" problem.If you are running nodejs in linux server, I think this is the best way. Create a service script and copy to /etc/init/nodejs.confstart service: sudo service nodejs startstop  service: sudo service nodejs stopSevice scriptTo round out the various options suggested, here is one more: the daemon command in GNU/Linux, which you can read about here: http://libslack.org/daemon/manpages/daemon.1.html. (apologies if this is already mentioned in one of the comments above).Try to run this command if you are using nohup - You can also use forever to start server Check out fugue! Apart from launching many workers, you can demonize your node process too!http://github.com/pgte/fugueuse nssm the best solution for windows, just download nssm, open cmd to nssm directory and typethis will install a new windows service which will be listed at services.msc from there you can start or stop the service, this service will auto start and you can configure to restart if it fails.PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks.\nhttps://github.com/Unitech/pm2I am surprised that nobody has mentioned GuvnorI have tried forever, pm2, etc. But, when it comes to solid control and web based performance metrics, I have found Guvnor to be by far the best. Plus, it is also fully opensource.Edit : However, I am not sure if it works on windows. I\'ve only used it on linux.has anyone noticed a trivial mistaken of the position of "2>&1" ?should be I use tmux for a multiple window/pane development environment on remote hosts. It\'s really simple to detach and keep the process running in the background. Have a look at tmuxJune 2017 Update:\nSolution for Linux: (Red hat).  Previous comments doesn\'t work for me.\nThis works for me on Amazon Web Service - Red Hat 7.  Hope this works for somebody out there.This answer is quite late to the party, but I found that the best solution was to write a shell script that used the both the screen -dmS and nohup commands. I also add the >> logfile bit on the end so I can easily save the node console.log() statements. Why did I use a shell script? Well I also added in an if statement that checked to see if the node myserver.js process was already running.That way I was able to create a single command line option that both lets me keep the server going and also restart it when I have made changes, which is very helpful for development.Its very simple.Following is a Package.JSON sample that anyone can use.\n    {\n      "name": "Project",
