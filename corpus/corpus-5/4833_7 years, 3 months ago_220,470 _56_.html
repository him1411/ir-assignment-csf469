I made an html page that has an <input> tag with type equals "text". When I click in it using Safari on iPhone, the page becomes larger (auto zoom). Does anybody know how to disable this?The browser will zoom if the font-size is less than 16px and the default font-size for form elements is 11px (at least in Chrome and Safari).Additionally, the select element needs to have the focus pseudo-class attached.It\'s not necessary to use all the above, you can just style the elements you need, eg: just text, number, and textarea:Alternate solution to have the input elements inherit from a parent style:I added a background since IOS adds no background on the select.If your website is properly designed for a mobile device you could decide not allow scaling.This solves the problem that your mobile page or form is going to \'float\' around.In summary the answer is: set the font size of the form elements to at least 16pxProper way to fix this issue is to change meta viewport to:There\'s no clean way I could find, but here\'s a hack...1) I noticed that the mouseover event happens prior to the zoom, but the zoom happens before mousedown or focus events.2) You can dynamically change the META viewport tag using javascript (see Enable/disable zoom on iPhone safari with Javascript?)So, try this (shown in jquery for compactness):This is definitely a hack... there may be situations where mouseover/down don\'t always catch entries/exits, but it worked well in my tests and is a solid start.I recently (today :D) had to integrate this behavior. In order to not impact the original design fields, including combo, I opted to apply the transformation at the focus of the field:Add user-scalable=0 to viewport meta as followingWorked for me :)Javascript hack which is working on iOS 7. This is based on @dlo \'s answer but mouseover and mouseout events are replaced by touchstart and touchend events. Basicly this script add a half second timeout before the zoom would enabled again to prevent zooming.I did this, also with jQuery:Of course, some other elements in the interface may have to be adapted if this 16px font-size breaks the design.I used Christina\'s solution above, but with a small modification for bootstrap and another rule to apply to desktop computers. Bootstrap\'s default font-size is 14px which causes the zoom. The following changes it to 16px for "form controls" in Bootstrap, preventing the zoom.And back to 14px for non-mobile browsers.I tried using .form-control:focus, which left it at 14px except on focus which changed it to 16px and it did not fix the zoom problem with iOS8. At least on my iPhone using iOS8, the font-size has to be 16px before focus for the iPhone to not zoom the page.This worked for me:I see people here do some strange stuff with JavaScript or the viewport function and turning off all manually zooming on devices.\nThat shouldn\'t be a solution in my opinion. Adding this CSS snippet will turn off the auto-zoom in iOS without changing your font-size to a fixed number like 16px.By default, I use 93.8% (15px) font-size at input fields and by adding my CSS snippet this stays at 93.8%. No need to change to 16px or make it a fixed number.Setting a font-size (for input fields) equal to the body\'s font-size, seems to be what prevents the browser from zooming out or in.\nI\'d suggest to use font-size: 1rem as a more elegant solution.After a while of while trying I came up with this solutionOn "mousedown" it sets font-size of input to 16px. This will prevent the zooming. On focus event it changes font-size back to initial value. Unlike solutions posted before, this will let you set the font-size of the input to whatever you want.After reading almost every single line here and testing the various solutions, this is, thanks to all who shared their solutions, what I came up with, tested and working for me on iPhone 7 iOS 10.x :It has some cons, though, noticeably a "jump" as result of the quick font size change occuring between the "hover"ed and "focus"ed states - and the redraw impact on performanceAs the automatical zoom-in (with no zoom-out) is still annonying on iPhone, here\'s a JavaScript based on dlo\'s suggestion working with focus/blur.Zooming is disabled as soon as a text input is fucused and re-anabled when the input is left.Note: Some users may not apprechiate editing texts in a small text input! Therefore, I personally prefer to change the input\'s text size during editing (see code below).The following code will change an input\'s text size to 16 pixel (calculated, i.e., in the current zoom size) during the element has the focus. iPhone will therefore not automatically zoom-in.Note: The zoom factor is calculated based on window.innerWidth and iPhone\'s display with of 320 pixels. This will only be valid for iPhone in  portrait mode.Based on Stephen Walsh\'s answer... This code works without changing the font size of inputs on focus (which looks lame), plus it still works with FastClick, which I suggest adding to all mobile sites to help bring the "snappy". Adjust your "viewport width" to suit your needs.A comment for the top answer about setting font-size to 16px asked how that is a solution, what if you want bigger/smaller font.I don\'t know about you all, but using px for font sizes is not the best way to go, you should be using em.I ran into this issue on my responsive site where my text field is larger than 16 pixels. I had my form container set to 2rem and my input field set to 1.4em. In my mobile queries I change html font-size depending on the viewport. Since the default html is 10, my input field calculates to 28px on desktopTo remove the auto-zoom I had to change my input to 1.6em. This increased my font size to 32px. Just slightly higher and hardly noticeable. On my iPhone 4&5 I change my html font-size to 15px for portrait and back to 10px for landscape. It appeard that the sweet spot for that pixel size was 48px which is why I changed to from 1.4em (42px) to 1.6em (48px).The thing you need to do is find the sweet spot on font-size and then convert it backwards in your rem/em sizes.It took me a while to find it but here\'s the best code that I found......http://nerd.vasilis.nl/prevent-ios-from-zooming-onfocus/As of iOS 10 (or perhaps earlier), you can prevent Safari from automatically zooming in on text fields during user input without disabling the user\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pinch zoom. Just add maximum-scale=1 but leave out the user-scale attribute suggested in other answers. (I would have added this as a comment to one of those answers, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have privileges, apparently.)It is a worthwhile option if you have a form in a layer that \xe2\x80\x9cfloats\xe2\x80\x9d around if zoomed, which can cause important UI elements to move off screen.<meta name=viewport content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">IT\'S WORK!!!
