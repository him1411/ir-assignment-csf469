How can I do an HTTP GET from a Un*x shell script on a stock OS X system? (installing third-party software is not an option, for this has to run on a lot of different systems which I don\'t have control on).For example if I start the Mercurial server locally doing a hg serve:And then, from a Linux that has the wget command I do a wget:And on the terminal in which I launched the "hg serve" command, I can indeed see that an HTTP GET made its way:So on Linux one way to do an HTTP GET from a shell script is to use wget (if that command is installed of course).What other ways are there to do the equivalent of a wget?  I\'m looking, in particular, for something that would work on stock OS X installs.I\'m going to have to say curl http://127.0.0.1:8000 -o outfilebrew install wgetHomebrew is a package manager for OSX analogous to yum, apt-get, choco, emerge, etc.  Be aware that you will also need to install Xcode and the Command Line Tools.  Virtually anyone who uses the command line in OSX will want to install these things anyway.If you can\'t or don\'t want to use homebrew, you could also:Install wget manually:Or, use a bash alias:Curl has a mode that is almost equivalent to the default wget.This works just likeAnd, if you like, you can add this to your .bashrc:It\'s not 100% compatible, but it works for the most common wget usage (IMO)1) on your mac type2) paste the following in3) close then make it executableThat\'s it.Use curl;Here\'s the Mac OS X equivalent of Linux\'s wget.For Linux, for instance Ubuntu on an AWS instance, use:On a Mac, i.e. for local development, use this:The -o parameter is required on a Mac for output into a file instead of on screen. Specify a different target name for renaming the downloaded file.Use capital -O for renaming with wget. Lowercase -o will specify output file for transfer log.You can either build wget on the mac machine or use MacPorts to install it directly.This would work like a charm, also you can update to the latest version as soon as it\'s available. Port is much more stable than brew, although has a lot less number of formula and ports.You can install MacPorts from https://www.macports.org/install.php you can download the .pkg file and install it. You could use curl instead. It is installed by default into /usr/bin.
