I have an odd problem. In Eclipse Ganymede, I used to be able to highlight a variable, and it would highlight the use of that variables in that method. However through some action I have now disabled it. Is there a way I can enable it? I tried searching Google, but since I don\'t know what the feature is called, its kinda tough.Its a really useful feature, and its annoying that its not working.There\'s a little "highlighter" icon on the toolbar - it toggles "Mark Occurrences".From the preferences window, the feature you mean is configured by navigating to:Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Mark OccurrencesThere\'s a little "highlighter" icon on the toolbar - it toggles "Mark Occurrences".You probably accidentally pressed it when trying to select a menu item at some point. I had a friend who did that with the "show selected element only" toolbar button...You can either press it again or configure as Rytmis says.Press alt-shift-O.It toggles the "Mark Occurrences" feature of Eclipse; which provides the highlighting functionality you\'re missing.In Eclipse Kepler,\nYou can simply use the "Toggle Mark Occurrences" icon on the tool bar or you can use keyboard short cut alt+shift+O.\nWindow > Preferences > Java > Editor > Mark Occurrences. Enable "Mark occurrences of the selected element in the current file" and click Apply.\nOn Mac OS it\'s opt-cmd-O I pressed that once by mistake, thanks to this question I found my way backI had this too and my Mark Occurrence options were already all checked. As always, try restarting Eclipse, it worked for me.EDIT: It actually kinda worked. There\'s a bug on Eclipse that when you open a project in a new window (in case your first Eclipse window is a mess full of projects) it starts not to work. In case you need you can select an item and toggle the highlighter in the toolbar or use Alt+Shift+O, but you\'re gonna have to do it every time you select an item.In addition, you have to go to General->Editors->Text Editors->Annotations, choose Occurrences and check the "Text as" and choose Highlighted.  This will make you happy.I had a similar problem. I solved it by uninstalling the erlang plugin called "erlide".I had the similar problem where the references were not highlighted,\non enabling the mark occurrences in windows-prefrences-java-editor I am able to highlight the referencesThat is probably how the \'mark occurences\' got turned off... I was using Ctrl+Shift+O to organize imports and by mistake chosen Alt instead of Ctrl.\nSo it can be turned on again by Alt+Shift+O.
