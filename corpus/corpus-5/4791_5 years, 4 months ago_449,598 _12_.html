I\'m trying to declare and use a variable in my batch file. It looks like it should be simple.The output I get is:What\'s going on here? Why is my variable not being echo\'d?The space before the = is interpreted as part of the name, and the space after it (as well as the quotation marks) are interpreted as part of the value.  So the variable you\xe2\x80\x99ve created can be referenced with %location\xc2\xa0%.  If that\xe2\x80\x99s not what you want, remove the extra space(s) in the definition.The spaces are significant. You created a variable named \'location \' with a value of \' "bob"\'.If you want quotes in your value, then your code should look likeIf you don\'t want quotes, then your code should look likeOr better yetThe last syntax prevents inadvertent spaces from getting in the value, and also protects against special characters like & | etc.input location.batoutput(mistakes u done : space and " ")
