When running docker a long time, there are a lot of images in system. How can I remove all unused docker images at once safety to free up the storage?In addition, I also want to remove images pulled months ago, which have correct TAGSo, I\'m not asking for removing untagged images only. I\'m searching for a way to remove general unused images, which includes both untagged and other images such as pulled months ago with correct TAGUpdate Sept. 2016 for docker upcoming docker 1.13: PR 26108 and commit 86de7c0 introduce a few new commands to help facilitate visualizing how much space the docker daemon data is taking on disk and allowing for easily cleaning up "unneeded" excess.docker system prune will delete ALL unused data (i.e. In order: containers stopped, volumes without containers and images with no containers).You also have:For unused images, use docker image prune -a (for removing dangling and ununsed images).\nWarning: \'unused\' means "images not referenced by any container": be careful before using -a.Original answer (Sep. 2016)I usually do:I have an alias for removing those [dangling images]8: drmiThe dangling=true filter finds unused imagesThat way, any intermediate image no longer referenced by a labelled image is removed.I do the same first for exited processes (containers)As haridsv points out in the comments:Technically, you should first clean up containers before cleaning up images, as this will catch more dangling images and less errors.Jess Frazelle (jfrazelle) has the bashrc function:To remove old images, and not just "unreferenced-dangling" images, you can consider docker-gc:A simple Docker container and image garbage collection script.Update the second (2017-07-08):Refer (again) to VonC, using the even more recent system prune. The impatient can skip the prompt with the -f, --force option:The impatient and reckless can additionally remove "unused images not just the dangling ones" with the -a, --all option:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/Update:Refer to VonC\'s answer which uses the recently added prune commands. Here is the corresponding shell alias convenience:Old answer:Delete stopped (exited) containers:Delete unused (dangling) images:If you have exercised extreme caution with regard to irrevocable data loss, then you can delete unused (dangling) volumes (v1.9 and up):Here they are in a convenient shell alias:References:To remove old tagged images that are more than a month old:Note that it\'ll fail to remove images that are used by a container, referenced in a repository, has dependent child images... which is probably what you want. Else just add -f flag.Example of /etc/cron.daily/docker-gc script:Assuming you have docker 1.13 or higher you can just use the prune commands. For your question specifically for removing old images, you want the first one.I would recommend not getting used to using the docker system prune command. I reckon users will accidentally remove things they don\'t mean to. Personally, I\'m going to mainly be using the docker image prune and docker container prune commands.This worked for me:I recently wrote a script to solve this on one of my servers:Till now (docker version 1.12) we are using the following command to delete all the running containers.  Also, if we want to delete the volumes, we can do that manually using its respective tag -v in the following command.Delete all Exited ContainersDelete all Stopped ContainersDelete All Running and Stopped ContainersRemove all containers, without any criteriaBut, in version 1.13 and above, for complete system and cleanup, we can directly user the following command: All unused containers, images, networks and volumes will get deleted. We can also do this using the following commands that clean up the individual components:or  Here is a script to clean up docker images and reclaim the space.Original scripthttps://github.com/vishalvsh1/docker-image-cleanupUsually docker keeps all temporary files related to image building and layers at/var/lib/dockerThis path is local to the system usually at root partition "/".You can mount a bigger disk space and move the content of /var/lib/docker to the new mount location and make sym link. \nThis way even docker images occupy space, will not affect  your system as it will be using some other mount location.Original Post - http://www.scmtechblog.net/2016/06/clean-up-docker-images-from-local-to.htmlI\'m using this command:This will remove all images that their creation time is greater then 10 weeks ago.How to remove a tagged imagedocker rmi the tag first docker rmi the image. # that can be done in one docker rmi call e.g.: #\ndocker rmi <repo:tag> <imageid>(this works Nov 2016, Docker version 1.12.2)e.g.e.g. Scripted remove anything older than 2 weeks.@VonC already gave a very nice answer but for completeness here is a little script I have been using---and which also nukes any errand docker processes should you have some:If you want to remove images pulled X months ago, you can try below example which remove imagess created 3 months ago:To remove tagged images which have not container running, you will have to use a little script:Remove old containers weeks ago.docker rm $(docker ps -a | grep "weeks" | awk \'{ print $1; }\')Remove old images weeks ago. Be careful. This will remove base images which was created weeks ago but which your new images might be using.docker rmi $(docker images | grep \'weeks\' | awk \'{ print $3; }\')(You\'ll be asked to confirm the command. Use -f to force run, if you know what you\'re doing.)Occasionally I have run into issues where Docker will allocate and continue to use disk space, even when the space is not allocated to any particular image or existing container.   The latest way I generated this issue accidentally was using "docker-engine" centos build instead of "docker" in RHEL 7.1.  What seems to happen is sometimes the container clean-ups are not completed successfully and then the space is never reused.   When the 80GB drive I allocated as / was filled with /var/lib/docker files I had to come up with a creative way to resolve the issue. Here is what I came up with.  First to resolve the disk full error:At this point I no longer had a disk full error, but I was still wasting a huge amount of space.   The next steps are to take care of that.Start Docker: systemctl start dockerSave the all the images:\ndocker save $(docker images |sed -e \'/^/d\' -e \'/^REPOSITORY/d\' -e \'s,[ ][ ],:,\' -e \'s,[ ].,,\') > /root/docker.imgUninstall docker.Erase everything in /var/lib/docker:\nrm -rf /var/lib/docker/[cdintv]*Reinstall dockerEnable docker: systemctl enable dockerStart docker: systemctl start dockerRestore images:\ndocker load < /root/docker.imgStart any persistent containers you need running.This dropped my disk usage from 67 GB for docker to 6 GB for docker.I do not recommend this for everyday use.   But it is useful to run when it looks like docker has lost track of used disk space do to software errors, or unexpected reboots.if you wish to automatically/periodically clean up exited containers and remove images and volumes that aren\'t in use by a running container you can download this image meltwater/docker-cleanup.Just run:It runs every 30mins by default. You can however set the delay time by using this flag in seconds  (DELAY_TIME=1800 option) More details: https://github.com/meltwater/docker-cleanup/blob/master/README.md
