Is there a way to change the name of an app without creating a new project?Example: On the home page where my apps are, I have an icon and the name Foo, but I want to change the name to Bar. Can I do this?Yes you can. By changing the android:label field in your application node in AndroidManifest.xml.As Pixie mentioned, it\'s the label attribute. Thanks.See more hereThere\'s the android:label for the application, and the android:label for the launch activity. The former is what you see under Settings -> Applications -> Manage Applications on your device. The latter is what you see under Applications, and by extension in any shortcut to your application, e.g.very easy, go to: res folder -> values -> strings.xml....\nI hope this is what you mean I noticed there are some differences in how the app name can turn up in Lollipop devices. Before Lollipop, you can have different app names with this:In Lollipop, it will be like this:In Lollipop, android:label in intent-filter is basically useless, while actionbar title and icon launcher is identical. So, if you want a different title in actionbar, you have no choice but to set dynamicallyYou might have to change the name of your main activity "android:label" also, as explained in Naming my application in androidif you want to change app name under launcher icon then change this android:label="@string/app_name" \ninside your Main Launcher activity tag And if you want to change app name inside Settings -> Application manager -> downloadedwhere you have all installed applications then change this android:label="@string/app_name"\ninside application tag It depends what you want to do. I personally wanted to rename my project so it didn\'t say MainActivity at the top of the app and underneath the icon on my phone menu.To do this I went into the Android Manifest.xml file and editedAnd edited the android:name=".Mynewname" and then edited the string title_activity_main in the strings.xml file to match the name.Hope that helps!To change android app\'s name , go to activity which is launcher activity and change its label like I have done above in my code.To change the name of your Android application in Android Studio or Eclipse, you have to change the value of the property android:label defined inside the <application> node in AndroidManifest.xmlby default the name of the application is referenced to a string defined in strings.xml file, for example:so, we have to change the value inside the strings.xml file:Nevermind I found it. It can be done in the manifest file under application just set the android label. Was thrown off at first becasue it didn\'t change my shortcut of the application\'s name.Edit the application tag in manifest file.Change the label attribute and give the latest name over there.Yes Of-course........Android Supports to change the name of the App before making build just like iOS (Build Configuration).\nYou can change it by Modifying the Android manifest file for the project.change the app string resource to your new activity
