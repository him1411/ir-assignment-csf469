I need to figure out how to get or make a build number for my Android application. I need the build number to display in the UI. Do I have to do something with AndroidManifest.xml?Use:And you can get the version code by using thisIf you\'re using the Gradle plugin/Android Studio, as of version 0.7.0, version code and version name are available statically in BuildConfig. Make sure you import your app\'s package, and not another BuildConfig:No Context object needed!Also make sure to specify them in your build.gradle file instead of the AndroidManifest.xml.Slightly shorter version if you just want the version name. Yep, it\'s that easy now.If you\'re getting a empty string for BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME then read on.I kept getting an empty string for BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME because I wasn\'t setting the versionName in my Grade build file (I migrated from ANT to Gradle). So, here are instructions for ensuring you\'re setting your VERSION_NAME via Gradle.build.gradleNote: This is from the masterful Jake Wharton.And since you\'ve set the versionName and versionCode in the build.gradle file now, you can also remove them from your AndroidManifest.xml file, if they are there.There are two parts you need:\nandroid:versionCode \nandroid:versionNameversionCode is a number, and every version of the app you submit to the Market needs to have a higher number then the last.VersionName is a string, and can be anything you want it to be.  This is where you define your app as "1.0" or "2.5" or "2 Alpha EXTREME!" or whatever.Example:\nTo access it in code, do something like:Here is a clean solution, based on the solution of scottyab (edited by Xavi). It shows how to get the context first, if it\'s not provided by your method. Furthermore it uses multiple lines instead of calling multiple methods per line. This makes it easier when you have to debug your application.Now that you received the version name in the String myVersionName, you can set it to a TextView or whatever you like.. If you\'re using PhoneGap, then create a custom PhoneGap plugin:Create a new class in your app\'s package:In the plugins.xml, add the following line:In your deviceready event, add the following code:Then, you can get the versionName attribute by doing:Derived from here and here.A very simple way is :Always do it with try catch block:I have SOLVE this by using Preference class. Here is the method for getting the version code:For xamarin users, use this code to get version name and code1) Version Name:2) Version Code:If you want to use it on xml then add below line on your gradle file:And then use it on your xml like this:This code was mentioned above in pieces but here it is again all included. You need a try/catch block because it may throw a "NameNotFoundException".I hope this simplifies things for someone down the road. :)Someone who does\xe2\x80\x99t need  BuildConfig info for application\'s UI however wants to use these info for setting a CI job configuration or others, like me.There is a automatically generated file, BuildConfig.java, under your project directory as long as you build your project successfully.{WORKSPACE}/build/generated/source/buildConfig/{debug|release}/{PACKAGE}/BuildConfig.javaSplit information you need by python script or other tools. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example:Please excuse my limited English ability, but hope this helps.First:and then use this:try this one: Example for inside Fragment usage.
