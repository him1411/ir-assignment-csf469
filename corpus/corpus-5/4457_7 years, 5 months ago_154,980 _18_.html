Typically the main use of the question mark is for the conditional, x ? "yes" : "no".But I have seen another use for it but can\'t find an explanation of this use of the ? operator, for example.It means that the value type in question is a nullable typeNullable types are instances of the System.Nullable struct. A\n  nullable type can represent the correct range of values for its\n  underlying value type, plus an additional null value. For example, a\n  Nullable, pronounced "Nullable of Int32," can be assigned any\n  value from -2147483648 to 2147483647, or it can be assigned the null\n  value. A Nullable can be assigned the values true, false, or\n  null. The ability to assign null to numeric and Boolean types is\n  especially useful when you are dealing with databases and other data\n  types that contain elements that may not be assigned a value. For\n  example, a Boolean field in a database can store the values true or\n  false, or it may be undefined.It is a shorthand for Nullable<int>. Nullable<T> is used with value types that cannot be null.Nullable TypesNullable types are instances of the\n  System.Nullable struct. A nullable\n  type can represent the normal range of\n  values for its underlying value type,\n  plus an additional null value. For\n  example, a [Nullable<Int32>], pronounced\n  "Nullable of Int32," can be assigned\n  any value from -2147483648 to\n  2147483647, or it can be assigned the\n  null value. A [Nullable<bool>] can be\n  assigned the values true or false, or\n  null. The ability to assign null to\n  numeric and Boolean types is\n  particularly useful when dealing with\n  databases and other data types\n  containing elements that may not be\n  assigned a value. For example, a\n  Boolean field in a database can store\n  the values true or false, or it may be\n  undefined.In the ? declares an if sentence. Here: x represents the boolean condition; The part before the : is the then sentence and the part after is the else sentence.In, for example,the ? declares a nullable type, and means that the type before it may have a null value.it declares that the type is nullable.practical usage:To add on to the answers above, here is a code sampleThis would give a compilation error:Error 12  Cannot convert null to \'Test\' because it is a non-nullable\n  value typeNotice that there is no compilation error for NullableTest. (note the ? in the declaration of t2)To create an optional, append a ? after the type you wish to wrap. Any type can be optional, even your own custom types. You can\'t have a space between the type and the ?.
