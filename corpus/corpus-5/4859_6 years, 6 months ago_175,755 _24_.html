Is there a Redis command for fetching all keys in the database? I have seen some python-redis libraries fetching them. But was wondering if it is possible from redis-client.Try to look at KEYS command. KEYS * will list all keys stored in redis.EDIT: please note the warning at the top of KEYS documentation page:Time complexity: O(N) with N being the number of keys in the database, under the assumption that the key names in the database and the given pattern have limited length.Updated for Redis 2.8 and aboveAs noted in the comments of previous answers to this question, KEYS is a potentially dangerous command since your Redis server will be unavailable to do other operations while it serves it. Another risk with KEYS is that it can consume (dependent on the size of your keyspace) a lot of RAM to prepare the response buffer, thus possibly exhausting your server\'s memory.Version 2.8 of Redis had introduced the SCAN family of commands that are much more polite and can be used for the same purpose.The CLI also provides a nice way to work with it:Take a look at following Redis Cheat Sheet.\nTo get a subset of redis keys with the redis-cli i use the commandIt can happen that using redis-cli, you connect to your remote redis-server, and then the command:is not showing anything, or better, it shows:\n(empty list or set)If you are absolutely sure that the Redis server you use is the one you have the data, then maybe your redis-cli is not connecting to the Redis correct database instance.As it is mentioned in the Redis docs, new connections connect as default to the db 0.In my case KEYS command was not retrieving results because my database was 1. In order to select the db you want, use SELECT.\nThe db is identified by an integer.I post this info because none of the previous answers was solving my issue.-->Get all keys from redis-cli -->Get list of patternsThis will produce keys which start by \'d\' with three characters.This wil get keys with matches \'t\' character in key-->Count keys from command line by-->Or you can use dbsizeYes, you can get all keys by using thisSCAN doesn\'t require the client to load all the keys into memory like KEYS does. SCAN gives you an iterator you can use. I had a 1B records in my redis and I could never get enough memory to return all the keys at once.Here is a python snippet to get all keys from the store matching a pattern and delete them:
