How to verify that a method is not called on an object\'s dependency?For example:With the Foo test:\n\n\n    public class FooTest {\n        @Test\n        public void dependencyIsNotCalled() {\n            final Foo foo = new Foo(...);\n            final Dependency dependency = mock(Dependency.class);\n            foo.bar(dependency);\n            // verify here that someMethod was not called??\n        }\n    }\nEven more meaningful :The documentation of this feature is there \xc2\xa74 "Verifying exact number of invocations / at least x / never", and the never javadoc is here.use the second argument on the Mockito.verify method, as in:verify(dependency, Mockito.times(0)).someMethod()As a more general pattern to follow, I tend to use an @After block in the test:Then the test is free to verify only what should be called.Also, I found that I often forgot to check for "no interactions", only to later discover that things were being called that shouldn\'t have been.So I find this pattern useful for catching all unexpected calls that haven\'t specifically been verified.Both the verifyNoMoreInteractions() and verifyZeroInteracions() method internally have the same implementation as:so we can use any one of them on mock object or array of mock objects to check that no methods have been called using mock objects.
