Is there a command I can invoke which will count the lines changed by a specific author in a Git repository? I know that there must be ways to count the number of commits as Github does this for their Impact graph.The output of the following command should be reasonably easy to send to script to add up the totals:This gives stats for all commits on the current HEAD. If you want to add up stats in other branches you will have to supply them as arguments to git log.For passing to a script, removing even the "oneline" format can be done with an empty log format, and as commented by Jakub Nar\xc4\x99bski, --numstat is another alternative. It generates per-file rather than per-line statistics but is even easier to parse.This gives some statistics about the author, modify as required.Using Gawk:Using Awk on Mac OSX:There is a new package on github that looks slick and uses bash as dependencies (tested on linux). It\'s more suitable for direct usage rather than scripts.It\'s git-quick-stats (github link).Copy git-quick-stats to a folder and add the folder to path.Usage:In case anyone wants to see the stats for every user in their codebase, a couple of my coworkers recently came up with this horrific one-liner:(Takes a few minutes to crunch through our repo, which has around 10-15k commits.)I found the following to be useful to see who had the most lines that were currently in the code base:The other answers have mostly focused on lines changed in commits, but if commits don\'t survive and are overwritten, they may just have been churn.  The above incantation also gets you all committers sorted by lines instead of just one at a time.  You can add some options to git blame (-C -M) to get some better numbers that take file movement and line movement between files into account, but the command might run a lot longer if you do.Also, if you\'re looking for lines changed in all commits for all committers, the follow little script is helpful:http://git-wt-commit.rubyforge.org/#git-rank-contributorsGit fame https://github.com/oleander/git-fame-rbis a nice tool to get the count for all authors at once, including commit and modified files count:There is also Python version at https://github.com/casperdcl/git-fame (mentioned by @fracz):Sample output:But be warned: as mentioned by Jared in the comment, doing it on a very large repository will take hours. Not sure if that could be improved though, considering that it must process so much Git data.To count number of commits by a given author (or all authors) on a given branch you can use git-shortlog; see especially its --numbered and --summary options, e.g. when run on git repository:After looking at Alex\'s and Gerty3000\'s answer, I have tried to shorten the one-liner:Basically, using git log numstat and not keeping track of the number of files changed.Git version 2.1.0 on Mac OSX:Example:The Answer from AaronM using the shell one-liner is good, but actually, there is yet another bug, where spaces will corrupt the user names if there are different amounts of white spaces between the user name and the date. The corrupted user names will give multiple rows for user counts and you have to sum them up yourself.This small change fixed the issue for me:Notice the + after \\s which will consume all whitespaces from the name to the date.Actually adding this answer as much for my own rememberance as for helping anyone else, since this is at least the second time I google the subject :)@mmrobins @AaronM @ErikZ @JamesMishra provided variants that all have an problem in common: they ask git to produce a mixture of info not intended for script consumption, including line contents from repository on the same line, then match the mess with a regexp. This is a problem when some lines aren\'t valid UTF-8 text, and also when some lines happen to match the regexp (this happened here).Here\'s a modified line that doesn\'t have these problems. It requests git to output data cleanly on separate lines, which makes it easy to filter what we want robustly:You can grep for other strings, like author-mail, committer, etc.Perhaps first do export LC_ALL=C (assuming bash) to force byte-level processing (this also happens to speed up grep tremendously from the UTF-8-based locales).A solution was given with ruby in the middle, perl being a little more available by default here is an alternative using perl for current lines by author.In addition to Charles Bailey\'s answer, you might want to add the -C parameter to the commands. Otherwise file renames count as lots of additions and removals (as many as the file has lines), even if the file content was not modified.To illustrate, here is a commit with lots of files being moved around from one of my projects, when using the git log --oneline --shortstat command:And here the same commit using the git log --oneline --shortstat -C command which detects file copies and renames:In my opinion the latter gives a more realistic view of how much impact a person has had on the project, because renaming a file is a much smaller operation than writing the file from scratch.Here\'s a quick ruby script that corrals up the impact per user against a given log query.For example, for rubinius:the script:Here\'s a short one-liner that produces stats for all authors. It\'s much faster than Dan\'s solution above at https://stackoverflow.com/a/20414465/1102119 (mine has time complexity O(N) instead of O(NM) where N is the number of commits, and M the number of authors).I provided a modification of a short answer above, but it wasnt sufficient for my needs.  I needed to be able to categorize both committed lines and lines in the final code.  I also wanted a break down by file.  This code does not recurse, it will only return the results for a single directory, but it is a good start if someone wanted to go further.  Copy and paste into a file and make executable or run it with Perl.this is the best way and it also gives you a clear picture of total number of commits by all the userThis script here will do it. Put it into authorship.sh, chmod +x it, and you\'re all set.You want Git blame.There\'s a --show-stats option to print some, well, stats.The question asked for information on a specific author, but many of the answers were solutions that returned ranked lists of authors based on their lines of code changed.This was what I was looking for, but the existing solutions were not quite perfect. In the interest of people that may find this question via Google, I\'ve made some improvements on them and made them into a shell script, which I display below. An annotated one (which I will continue to maintain) can be found on my Github.There are no dependencies on either Perl or Ruby. Furthermore, whitespace, renames, and line movements are taken into account in the line change count. Just put this into a file and pass your Git repository as the first parameter.The best tool so far I identfied is gitinspector. It give the set report per user, per week etc\nYou can install like below with npmnpm install -g gitinspectorThe links to get the more detailshttps://www.npmjs.com/package/gitinspectorhttps://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector/wiki/Documentationhttps://github.com/ejwa/gitinspectorexample commands are
