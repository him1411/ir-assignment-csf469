I do cmake . && make all install.\nThis works but installs to /usr/local.I need to install to a different prefix (for example, to /usr).  What is the cmake and make command line to install to /usr instead of /usr/local?You can pass in any CMake variable on the command line, or edit cached variables using ccmake/cmake-gui. On the command line,Would configure the project, build all targets and install to the /usr prefix. The type (PATH) is not strictly necessary, but would cause the Qt based cmake-gui to present the directory chooser dialog.The ":PATH" part in the accepted answer can be omitted. This syntax may be more memorable:...as used in the answers here.Note that in both cmake and autotools you don\'t always have to set the installation path at configure time. You can use DESTDIR at install time (see also here) instead as in:See also this question which explains the subtle difference between DESTDIR and PREFIX.This is intended for staged installs and to allow for storing programs in a different location from where they are run e.g. /etc/alternatives via symbolic links.\nHowever if your package is relocatable and doesn\'t need any hard coded (prefix) paths set via the configure stage you may be able to skip it.\nSo instead of:you would run:Note that as user7498341 points out this is not appropriate for cases where you really should be using PREFIX.the way I build cmake projects cross platform is the following:afterwards I use the installed files to create packages or  include them in other projects...Regarding Bruce Adams answer:Your answer creates dangerous confusion. DESTDIR is intended for\ninstalls out of the root tree. It allows one to see what would be\ninstalled in the root tree if one did not specify DESTDIR.\nPREFIX is the base directory upon which the real installation is\nbased.For example, PREFIX=/usr/local indicates that the final destination\nof a package is /usr/local. Using DESTDIR=$HOME will install the files\nas if $HOME was the root (/). If, say DESTDIR, was /tmp/destdir, one\ncould see what \'make install\' would affect. In that spirit, DESTDIR\nshould never affect the built objects.A makefile segment to explain it:Programs must assume that PREFIX is the base directory of the final\n(i.e. production) directory. The possibility of symlinking a program\ninstalled in DESTDIR=/something only means that the program does not\naccess files based upon PREFIX as it would simply not work. cat(1)\nis a program that (in its simplest form) can run from anywhere.\nHere is an example that won\'t:If you tried to run prog from elsewhere than $PREFIX/bin/prog,\nprog.db would never be found as it is not in its expected location.Finally, /etc/alternatives really does not work this way. There are\nsymlinks to programs installed in the root tree (e.g. vi -> /usr/bin/nvi,\nvi -> /usr/bin/vim, etc.).It is considered as bad practice to invoke the actual generator (e.g. via make) if using CMake. It is highly recommended to do it like this:Configure phase:Build and Install phasesWhen following this approach, the generator can be easily switched (e.g. -GNinja for Ninja) without having to remember any generator-specific commands.
