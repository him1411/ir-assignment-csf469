I keep getting this error when I try to submit my app to the store using Xcode:  ERROR ITMS-90475: "Invalid Bundle. iPad Multitasking support requires launch storyboard in bundle \'com.companyname.appname.\'"Anyone know what this error really means?This is because you need to specify how your app is supposed to handle multitasking on iPad.If you don\'t want to handle multitasking right now, you can simply disable it by going to the "General" tab of your target:I solved the problem in this way, see here:If you must opt out of Slide Over and Split View, do so explicitly by adding the UIRequiresFullScreen key to your Xcode project\xe2\x80\x99s Info.plist file and apply the Boolean value YES. You need to add a Launch Screen (Xcode > File > New). \nUnder iOS > User Interface you select "Launch Screen" to add it to the project.For the iPad you need to support all 4 orientations.Select in Xcode your target file, and under the General Tab, go to the "App icons and Launch Images".\nHere you select the Launch Screen file you created.\nWhen you launch the app you\'ll see the launch (bitmap) images are not used, but the Launch Screen Storyboard.You can either do it as Andr\xc3\xa9 showed or directly add:On your .plist file.You can find  "Requires full screen" checkbox under General > TargetsIf you are using Cordova, you might want to use the cordova-ios-requires-fullscreen plugin (see How to disable iOS9 multitasking through Ionic/Cordova?)Update: you can also use the cordova-plugin-ipad-multitasking, which seems to also prevent another issue (ITMS-90474)Update: this should now be fixed using Cordova tools 5.4 without the need for these plugins.From Xcode 8.x.
