How can I convert an int datatype into a string datatype in C#?Just in case you want the binary representation and you\'re still drunk from last nights party:Note: Something about not handling endianness very nicely...Edit:\nIf you don\'t mind sacrificing a bit of memory for speed, you can use below to generate an array with pre-calculated string values:The ToString method of any object is supposed to return a string representation of that object.or:In some conditions, yo do not have to use ToString()Further on to @Xavier\'s response, here\'s a page that does speed comparisons between several different ways to do the conversion from 100 iterations up to 21,474,836 iterations.It seems pretty much a tie between:None of the answers mentioned that the ToString() method can be applied to integer expressionseven to integer literalsAlthough integer literals like this are often considered to be bad coding style (Magic numbers) there may be cases where this feature is useful...There are many ways.like
