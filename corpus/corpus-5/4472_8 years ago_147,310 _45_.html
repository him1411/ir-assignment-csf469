To increase font-size in Xcode is a pain.For Xcode 4.1Still a huge pain.  Poor UI design (But my mindset does not seem to match the mindset of software engineers that make 100+ character variable and method names. Enough of my complaining)I\'ll modify a previous post for the current version.In the source editor box there is a list of types of text that you may set the font for:\n Plain text\n Comments\n Documentation Comments\n .\n .\n .Select any or all items from the source editor list and the name and size of the font for\nthat particular text will show up in the \'Font\' window below the \'Source Editor\' window.\n(If you happen to skip highlighting one of these, you will be able to get to the Font\nInspector and select new sizes, but will wonder why the changes you make are not being\napplied!)Congratulations.  Your may now read your code.\nWasn\'t that painless?Easisest solution: Close any open projects.Xcode > Preferences > Font & ColorsMake sure to press CMD+A to select all possible text types. Then change the font size from the picker. Update! - Behold Xcode 9 to the rescue!\nNow you can use cmd + to increase the fonts with Xcode 9.\nIt took 5 Major releases for you to get it, Apple! But better late than never.figured it out - however it was not very intuitive.First some Pain PointsWhen You try to change the font size directly using edit -> format -> font, nothing happens! - Not a good UX ... moreover why play dumb when you can tell user that they are using default or "System-owned" theme and they cannot change it? - Bad Design and more bad UX ... Why keep this option (Cmd t) alive, which by the way is most standard way to increase font size across most well behaved mac apps, if you do not want user to change the font this way?In Xcode preferences, when you try to change the font size by clicking on "fonts and colors", thats when XCode gives a pop-up saying what needs to be done. Also making a duplicate and then changing the fonts and colors is a lot of work rather than giving a button that says "Restore to Defaults" if Apple is so worried about the user messing up the default settings!The solution is that - you need to duplicate the theme and then modify the copy you just made and apply that copy - phew!Watch out because there\'s no undo!You can use this plugin to change the font size using \xe2\x8c\x98 + or \xe2\x8c\x98 - (Control - and Control + in the latest versions of Xcode. The plugin developers changed the shortcut to avoid conflict with Interface Builder hotkeys): https://github.com/zats/AdjustFontSize-Xcode-PluginYou can use the following:Go to Xcode -> preference -> fonts and color, then pick the presentation one. The font will be enlarged automatically.Actually, this is very easy:Good luck!Go toDouble-click on Plain Text, a popup menu will come up. Change it from there.When changing fonts in XCode from [Preferences] (after duplicating a template that matches colours close to what you want), you can select multiple entries and change the fonts all at once.  Use [shift] to select a range or [cmd] to select multiple individual entries (e.g. you might select both \'comments\' and \'strings\' and change only their fonts).SteveI also found that you can change the fonts for printing which is controlled by the "Printing" theme.  I wanted the print output to be the same as the default, but with a larger font.rename "printing" to "printing1" (select the printing theme and click on it and it should allow you to change the name).click the "+" and select "Default" from the "New Theme From Template" selectionrename it "Printing"click in the font area for "Source Editor" and cmd-A to select all of the fontschange the font size to some desired value (I like 12 point) by clicking the "T" icon and selecting the desired font sizeAfter this the printouts should match the new "Printing" template (i.e. in color and bigger, or however you make the template), the key is that printing takes its formating from the "Printing" Theme.  Go to Xcode -> Preferences... -> Font & Colors -> \'select all types of font in\' Default tab.On this Selection apply Font Size from bottom control. Apply following some steps:Go to xcode_preferences->Then select font and colors->select all the text options->click on the font section and change fonts u want It is Aug 2011, Xcode 4.1 and it continues to be nightmare.  Why not allow Cmd+ and Cmd- like everywhere else.\n< end rant >As suggested by other respondents I suggest that you copy your preferred theme before you tweak the fonts for there is no ease way to undo.In my case, all I wanted to do was increase the font size.  Mercifully you can select multiple items (Shift+select or Cmd+select) and set the font for all the ones selected in one fell swoop.Minor relief for a major irritation.
