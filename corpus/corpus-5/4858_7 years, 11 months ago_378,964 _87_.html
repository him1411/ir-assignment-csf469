I like to be sure that everything will work just by copying the contents of the Java folder and setting the environment variables.I usually run the installer in a virtual machine, zip the \\java folder contents, go back to a snapshot of the virtual machine, and then unzip the compressed file.I couldn\'t find a place where the latest JRE / JDK is available as a zip file...http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsphttp://download.java.net/jdk6/Alternately, is it safe to assume that exe installer from sun just will just unzip the whole thing, without messing around with the registry, environment variables, etc...?You can download a Java Portable from PortableApps.com. It will not change your system settings. You can put it on your USB stick.UPD: for those who needs JDK there\'s an open-source project OpenJDK PortableJDK is not available as a portable ZIP file, unfortunately. However, you can follow these steps:This solution works for JDK 8 too, without Admin rights.Here is a good, but a little complex, way:Download the JRE or JDK from the Oracle (Sun) website. This method will work on any version and on SDK or JRE.Run and wait for the installer to load. Minimize the window.In Windows 7, you should browse to this location:C:\\Users\\ YOUR_USER_NAME \\AppData\\LocalLow\\Sun\\JavaThere, you will have a few MSI and CAB files.Browse to Universal Extractor | LegRoom.net and download UniExtract Binary Archive.Use WinRar or any un-RAR program available to you, and extract uniextract161_noinst.rar anywhere.Drag & drop jdk1.6.0_31.msi or jre1.6.0_31.msi on the icon of UniExtract.exe.Select "Extract Method: MSI Administrative Installer". Wait for the process to finish.Enter the new created folder.If you\'ve drag-and-dropped jre1.6.0_31.msi you should have a jre1.6.0_31 folderFollow all levels inside and you\'ll see core.zip.\nThis is what you are after. You can just unzip it anywhere and you\'ll have the content of the Java runtime or SDK without installing anything on your system.The answer has been given before. It  works for "jdk-8u91-windows-x64.exe" alsoUnzip tools.zip to a folder folder_name so we get the contents in the picture\nIn cmd move to the folder folder_name/bin and run the command java -versionthe output will be this indicates that there is something messing. Actually we need to unpack all packages.In cmd move to the folder folder_name and automatically do the unpacking by executing the command for /r %x in (*.pack) do .\\bin\\unpack200 -r "%x" "%~dx%~px%~nx.jar"Do step 3 again, if you get the output bellow, then the JDK is ready to use. For JDK 8u102 things have changed, this worked for me:src.zip is in a linux download: jdk-VERSION-linux-x64.tar.\nPut a copy into %JDK-VERSION%Now you are ready to go.\nYou might want to setup JAVA_HOME and PATH to point to your %JDK-VERSION% dir and its BIN subdir.Tested for version: jdk-7u60-windows-x64.exe, jdk-7u60-windows-x64.exeTested for version: jdk-7u55-windows-x64.exeThere is a .tar.gz file of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on the Oracle website for these operations systems: Windows x86, Windows x64, Linux x86, Linux x64, Mac OS X x64,  Solaris x64.\nSee: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.htmlAlso there is the Java Development Kit (JDK): http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html.\nThe Windows .tar.gz. is missing, but you can just extract the .exe file with a tool like 7zip.I found this is very useful to make Eclipse portable. ;-)This is how I do it, Start with the exe installation and wait for the below screen,Go to the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java and copy your JDK to another place.Cancel the installation by clicking \'x\' and uninstall JDK.Copy the copied JDK back into C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java or other folder of your choiceDownload the Processing application from http://www.processing.org/download/. The zip file contains a folder called java. It includes the JDK 1.6.0_32 (version checked on 19/02/2013). Here is a link for JDK 5 zip file.\nsun-jdk-5-win32-x86-1.5.0.12.zipThe Sun JVM is available as a MSI which is executable from a script.http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/deployment/deployment-guide/install-msi.htmlYou can just use 7zip (or another similar app) to get the dirs inside the core.zip file that\'s bundled in the installer.\nJust use 7zip to browse the exe, you\'ll see a core.zip file which has all the files that usually go inside "jreX" dir (where X is the major version number).\nAs for setting env variables and the such, you can follow the other answers. If all you want is a portable jre (for example, you can run your jars by using java.exe jarfile or javaw.exe jarfile) then this solution will do.\nThis is very similar to copying the jre dir from one place to anotherYou can download a portable Zulu .zip archive from Azul Systems, which are builds of OpenJDK for Windows, Linux (RHEL, SUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS) and Mac OS X.Zulu is a certified build of OpenJDK that is fully compliant with the Java SE standard. Zulu is 100% open source and freely downloadable. Now Java developers, system administrators and end users can enjoy the full benefits of open source Java with deployment flexibility and control over upgrade timing.More technical information on different JVMs (including Zulu) with their architectures and OS support here.try this:\nhttp://maven.nuiton.org/nexus/content/repositories/jvm/com/oracle/jre/this link contains portable zip distributions for all versions.Thanks for asking; the JDK does not seem to interact with the Windows registry.However, the JRE does in certain instances.Link: http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0604.htmlThe Process described by Igor and CharlesB Works to me, since IDE\'s like NetBeans and Eclipse permit specify the location of the JDK, even software like Apache Tomcat (the ZIP Distribution) use BASH - FILES to set it up (then specify the JDK location using relatives URI).\nI Have a USB-HardDisk With NetBeans, Eclipse, Apache Tomcat working with a JDK in "portable mode".\nI Had a way to extract a copy of the JDK from the installers files: Install it, Copy it in other place and then uninstall it. A dirty way to extract it, but was successfull.\nThe place to put EXTRA - LIBS was: %PLACE_WHERE_JDK_ARE%\\jre\\lib\\extThis linkhttp://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsphelps you at least avoid the obnoxious preload installer getting straight to the SDK.From there, I would install this in a throw-away VM, on your old crufty PC or elsewhere, then transfer the resulting(or similar) to your new machine, set the very few usual ENV variables, and there you ideally go, w/o all the marketing junk and potential tie-ins. Of course, also w/o the security from frequent automatic updates.I discovered you can run the installer in Wine. This works:WINEPREFIX=/home/jason/java wine jre-7u11-windows-i586.exeThen once it is finished you can just zip up the /home/jason/java/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/Java/jre7/This should work for jdk as wellYou can download SEVER JRE it contains jdk. server jre 7Now extracted JDK folder will be created in same folder.I did copy the JRE folder several times and it always works fine. But I am really not sure if you can just get a zip file with its contents, as the official installation install the plugins for IE, Firefox and whatsoever.http://androidhost.org/D8wsvYou can get jre-7u75-windows-i586.zip from the link above.Tested with jdk-8u74-macosx-x64.dmg.http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.htmlHere\'s where. Download the .gz package.or The widely-upvoted answer is fine, I\'ve used it for quite some time in the form of this bat file:It requires access on the path to 7zip, and must be run in a folder alongside the JDK of your choice (it\'ll find it because of the *.exe up here).Works on 8u144, and I guess it worked from the 8u20 thing.I installed JDK 8 with the exe installer and then uninstalled JRE, I now have JDK folder with no env variable or other setting changed.This worked just fine for me: http://www.brucalipto.org/java/how-to-create-a-portable-jdk-1-dot-7-on-windows/Commands from tips below wrapped as batch script. Save this as unpack.bat. Then place it to dir with jdk/jre extracted files.
