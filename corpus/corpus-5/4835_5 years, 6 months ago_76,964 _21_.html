I have being playing around with requirejs for the last few days.  I am trying to understand the differences between define and require.Define seems to allow for module separation and allow for dependency ordering to be adhere.  But it downloads all the files it needs to begin with.  Whilst require only loads what you need when you need it.Can these two be used together and for what purposes should each of them be used?With define you register a module in require.js that you can then depend on in other module definitions or require statements.\nWith require you "just" load/use a module or javascript file that can be loaded by require.js.\nFor examples have a look at the documentationMy rule of thumb:Define: If you want to declare a module other parts of your application will depend on.Require: If you just want to load and use stuff.From the require.js source code (line 1902):The define() function  accepts two optional parameters (a string that represent a module ID and an array of required modules) and one required parameter (a factory method).The return of the factory method MUST return the implementation for your module (in the same way that the Module Pattern does).The require() function doesn\'t have to return the implementation of a new module.Using define() you are asking something like "run the function that I am passing as a parameter and assign whatever returns to the ID that I am passing but, before, check that these dependencies are loaded".Using require() you are saying something like "the function that I pass has the following dependencies, check that these dependencies are loaded before running it".The require() function is where you use your defined modules, in order to be sure that the modules are defined, but you are not defining new modules there."define" method for facilitating module definition \nand \n"require" method for handling dependency loadingdefine is used to define named or unnamed modules based on the proposal using the following signature:require on the other hand is typically used to load code in a top-level JavaScript file or within a module should you wish to dynamically fetch dependenciesRefer to https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/ for more information.require() and define() both used to load dependencies.There is a major difference between these two method.Its very Simple GuysRequire() : Method is used to run immediate functionalities.\ndefine() : Method is used to define modules for use in multiple locations(reuse).
