I am testing my iPhone application on an iOS 3.1.3 iPhone.  I am selecting/capturing an image using a UIImagePickerController:I then at some point send it to my web server using the ASI classes:the problem:\nwhen i take a picture with the iphone while holding it landscape, the image gets uploaded to the server and it viewed like you would expect.  when taking a picture holding the phone in portrait, the image is uploaded and viewed as it had been rotated 90 degrees.my application is set to only work in portrait modes(upsidedown and regular).How can i make the image always show the correct orientation after uploading?the image appears to be correct as displayed in an UIImageView(directly after taking the picture), but viewing on the server says otherwise.A UIImage has a property imageOrientation, which instructs the UIImageView and other UIImage consumers to rotate the raw image data. There\'s a good chance that this flag is being saved to the exif data in the uploaded jpeg image, but the program you use to view it is not honoring that flag.To rotate the UIImage to display properly when uploaded, you can use a category like this:UIImage+fixOrientation.hUIImage+fixOrientation.mI figured out a much simpler one:BTW: @Anomie\'s code does not take scale into account, so will not work for 2x images.Here is a Swift version of the answer by @an0:Also in a more general function:Swift 3 version:Solution for Swift 3.1 for orientation issue while capturing the image from Camera.I have updated the solution given by jake and Metal HeartUIImage extensionSwift 2.0Use of this UIImage Extension in your code:let fixOrientationImage=chosenImage.fixOrientation()place this in your delegate methods of image picker like thisSwift 3.1Swift 2.0in swift ;)UPDATE SWIFT 3.0 :DI used this page when designing my app that takes pictures and I found that the following method will correct the orientation and use less memory and processor than previous answers:This basically just rewraps the actual image data with a new orientation. I was using @an0\'s code but it makes a new image in memory which can be taxing on a 3264x2448 image that you might get from a camera.If you enable editing, then the edited image (as opposed to the original) will be oriented as expected:Enabling editing allows the user to resize and move the image before tapping "Use Photo"This what I have found for fixing orientation issueEDIT:Here is an UIImage extension in Swift 2 based on the accepted answer by @Anomie. It uses a clearer switch case. It also takes the optional value returned by CGBitmapContextCreateImage() into consideration.Here\'s UIImage extension for swift:Based on MetalHeart2003\'s earlier work..Update for Swift 3.1 based on Sourabh Sharma\'s  answer, with code clean up.Picker delegate method example:If I understand, what you want to do is disregard the orientation of the UIImage? If so then you could do this:-or in Swift :-It solved my cropping issue.. Hope, this is what you\'re looking for..Swift 3 version based on @jake1981 who\'ve taken it from @MetalHeart2003
