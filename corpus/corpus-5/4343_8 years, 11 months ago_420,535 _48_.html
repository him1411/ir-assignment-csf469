I am trying to animate a change in backgroundColor using jQuery on mouseover.I have checked some example and I seem to have it right, it works with other properties like fontSize, but with backgroundColor I get and "Invalid Property" js error.\nThe element I am working with is a div.Any ideas?The color plugin is only 4kb so much cheaper than the UI library.  Of course you\'ll want to use a decent version of the plugin and not some buggy old thing which doesn\'t handle Safari and crashes when the transitions are too fast.  Since a minified version isn\'t supplied you might like test various compressors and make your own min version.  YUI gets the best compression in this case needing only 2317 bytes and since it is so small - here it is:I had the same problem and fixed it by including jQuery UI. Here is the complete script : Do it with CSS3-Transitions. Support is great (all modern browsers, even IE). With Compass and SASS this is quickly done:Pure CSS:I\'ve wrote an german article about this topic: http://www.solife.cc/blog/animation-farben-css3-transition.htmlBitstorm has the best jquery color animation plugin I\'ve seen. It\'s an improvement to the jquery color project. It also supports rgba.http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/You can use jQuery UI to add this functionality. You can grab just what you need, so if you want to animate color, all you have to include is the following code. I got if from latest jQuery UI (currently 1.8.14)It\'s only 1.43kb after compressing with YUI:You can also animate colors using CSS3 transitions but it\'s only supported by modern browsers. Using shorthand property:Unlike regular javascript transitions, CSS3 transitions are hardware accelerated and therefore smoother. You can use Modernizr, to find out if the browser supports CSS3 transitions, if it didn\'t then you can use jQuery as a fallback:Remember to use stop() to stop the current animation before starting a new one otherwise when you pass over the element too fast, the effect keeps blinking for a while.You can use 2 divs:You could put a clone on top of it and fade the original out while fading the clone in.When the fades are done, restore the original with the new bg..toggleClass()\n.offset()\n.fadeIn()\n.fadeOut()For anyone finding this. Your better off using the jQuery UI version because it works on all browsers. The color plugin has issues with Safari and Chrome. It only works sometimes.I used a combination of CSS transitions with JQuery for the desired effect; obviously browsers which don\'t support CSS transitions will not animate but its a lightweight option which works well for most browsers and for my requirements is acceptable degradation.Jquery to change the background color: CSS using transition to fade background-color changeThese days jQuery color plugin supports following named colors:I like using delay() to get this done, here\'s an example:This can be called by a function, with "element" being the element class/name/etc. The element will instantly appear with the #FCFCD8 background, hold for a second, then fade into #EFEAEA. I made a version that supports rgba, based off the github version. However, it won\'t work in IE since it only does rgba. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/57502/jquery.color.jsI stumbled across this page with the same issue, but the following problems:With the above that pretty much ruled out every answer. Considering my fade of colour was very simple, I used the following quick hack instead:The above creates a temporary div that is never placed in the document flow. I then use jQuery\'s built-in animation to animate a numeric property of that element - in this case width - which can represent a percentage (0 to 100). Then, using the step function, I transfer this numeric animation to the text colour with a simple hex cacluation.The same could have been achieved with setInterval, but by using this method you can benefit from jQuery\'s animation methods - like .stop() - and you can use easing and duration.Obivously it\'s only of use for simple colour fades, for more complicated colour conversions you\'ll need to use one of the above answers - or code your own colour fade math :)Simply add the following snippet bellow your jquery script and enjoy:See the exampleReference for more infoColorBlend plug in does exactly what u wanthttp://plugins.jquery.com/project/colorBlendHere is the my highlight codeIf you wan\'t to animate your background using only core jQuery functionality, try this:Try this one:you can preview example here: http://jquerydemo.com/demo/jquery-animate-background-color.aspxStrange thing is that you can animate using CSS3 transition but cannot do it with jQuery. that\'s pity :(Animate backgroundColor on mouseover comparison on Fiddle (example including the latest jQuery color plugin) Try to use itTry this one:Revised way with effects:
