Javascript 1.9.3 / ECMAScript 5 introduces Object.create, which Douglas Crockford amongst others has been advocating for a long time. How do I replace new in the code below with Object.create?(Assume MY_GLOBAL.nextId exists).The best I can come up with is:There doesn\'t seem to be any advantage, so I think I\'m not getting it. I\'m probably being too neo-classical. How should I use Object.create to create user \'bob\'?With only one level of inheritance, your example may not let you see the real benefits of Object.create.This methods allows you to easily implement differential inheritance, where objects can directly inherit from other objects.On your userB example, I don\'t think that your init method should be public or even exist, if you call again this method on an existing object instance, the id and name properties will change.Object.create lets you initialize object properties using its second argument, e.g.:As you can see, the properties can be initialized on the second argument of Object.create, with an object literal using a syntax similar to the used by the Object.defineProperties and Object.defineProperty methods.It lets you set the property attributes (enumerable, writable, or configurable), which can be really useful.Object.create is not yet standard on several browsers, for example IE8, Opera v11.5, Konq 4.3 do not have it. You can use Douglas Crockford\'s version of Object.create for those browsers but this doesn\'t include the second \'initialisation object\' parameter used in CMS\'s answer.For cross browser code one way to get object initialisation in the meantime is to customise Crockford\'s Object.create. Here is one method:-This maintains Crockford prototypal inheritance, and also checks for any init method in the object, then runs it with your parameter(s), like say new man(\'John\',\'Smith\'). Your code then becomes:-So bob inherits the sayHello method and now has own properties id=1 and name=\'Bob\'. These properties are both writable and enumerable of course. This is also a much simpler way to initialise than for ECMA Object.create especially if you aren\'t concerned about the writable, enumerable and configurable attributes.For initialisation without an init method the following Crockford mod could be used:-This fills the userB own properties, in the order they are defined, using the Object.gen parameters from left to right after the userB parameter. It uses the for(prop in o) loop so, by ECMA standards, the order of property enumeration cannot be guaranteed the same as the order of property definition. However, several code examples tested on (4) major browsers show they are the same, provided the hasOwnProperty filter is used, and sometimes even if not.Somewhat simpler I would say than Object.build since userB does not need an init method. Also userB is not specifically a constructor but looks like a normal singleton object. So with this method you can construct and initialise from normal plain objects.There is really no advantage in using Object.create(...) over new object.Those advocating this method generally state rather ambiguous advantages: "scalability", or "more natural to JavaScript" etc. However, I have yet to see a concrete example that shows that Object.create has any advantages over using new. On the contrary there are known problems with it. Sam Elsamman describes what happens when there are nested objects and Object.create(...) is used:This occurs because Object.create(...) advocates a practice where data is used to create new objects; here the Animal datum becomes part of the prototype of lion and bird, and causes problems as it is shared. When using new the prototypal inheritance is explicit:Regarding, the optional property attributes that are passed into Object.create(...), these can be added using Object.defineProperties(...).TL;DR:new Computer() will invoke the constructor function Computer(){} for one time, while Object.create(Computer.prototype) won\'t.All the advantages are based on this point. Though for some inside-engine-optimization reasons, Object.create may be slower.You could make the init method return this, and then chain the calls together, like this:Another possible usage of Object.create is to clone immutable objects in a cheap and effective way.Notes: The above snippet creates a clone of an source object (aka not a reference, as in cObj = aObj). It benefits over the copy-properties method (see 1), in that it does not copy object member properties. Rather it creates another -destination- object with it\'s prototype set on the source object. Moreover when properties are modified on the dest object, they are created "on the fly", masking the prototype\'s (src\'s) properties.This constitutes a fast an effective way of cloning immutable objects.The caveat here is that this applies to source objects that should not be modified after creation (immutable). If the source object is modified after creation, all the clone\'s unmasked properties will be modified, too.Fiddle here(http://jsfiddle.net/y5b5q/1/) (needs Object.create capable browser).Sometimes you cannot create an object with NEW but are still able to invoke the CREATE method.For example: if you want to define a Custom Element it must derive from HTMLElement.You have to make a custom Object.create() function. One that addresses Crockfords concerns and also calls your init function.This will work:Here UserB is like Object.create, but adjusted for our needs.If you want, you can also call:The advantage is that Object.create is typically slower than new on most browsersIn this jsperf example, in a Chromium, browser new is 30 times as fast as Object.create(obj) although both are pretty fast. This is all pretty strange because new does more things (like invoking a constructor) where Object.create should be just creating a new Object with the passed in object as a prototype (secret link in Crockford-speak)Perhaps the browsers have not caught up in making Object.create more efficient (perhaps they are basing it on new under the covers ... even in native code)I think the main point in question - is to understand difference between new and Object.create approaches. Accordingly to this answer and to this video new keyword does next things:Creates new object.Links new object to constructor function (prototype).Makes this variable point to the new object.Executes constructor function using the new object and implicit perform return this;Assigns constructor function name to new object\'s property constructor.Object.create performs only 1st and 2nd steps!!!In code example provided in question it isn\'t big deal, but in next example it is:As side effect result will be:because of Guest.prototype = new SiteMember();\nBut we don\'t need to execute parent constructor method, we need only make method getName to be available in Guest.\nHence we have to use Object.create.\nIf replace Guest.prototype = new SiteMember();\nto Guest.prototype = Object.create(SiteMember.prototype); result be:
