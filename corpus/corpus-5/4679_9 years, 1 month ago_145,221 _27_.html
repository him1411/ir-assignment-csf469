How do you express an integer as a binary number with Python literals?I was easily able to find the answer for hex:and octal:How do you use literals to express binary in Python?Summary of AnswersFor referenceâ€”future Python possibilities:\nStarting with Python 2.6 you can express binary literals using the prefix 0b or 0B:You can also use the new bin function to get the binary representation of a number:Development version of the documentation: What\'s New in Python 2.6Another way.They\'re not "binary" literals, but rather, "integer literals". You can express integer literals with a binary format with a 0 followed by a B or b followed by a series of zeros and ones, for example:From the Python 3 docs, these are the ways of providing integer literals in Python:Integer literals are described by the following lexical definitions:There is no limit for the length of integer literals apart from what\n  can be stored in available memory.Note that leading zeros in a non-zero decimal number are not allowed.\n  This is for disambiguation with C-style octal literals, which Python\n  used before version 3.0.Some examples of integer literals:Changed in version 3.6: Underscores are now allowed for grouping purposes in literals.You can have the zeros and ones in a string object which can be manipulated (although you should probably just do bitwise operations on the integer in most cases) - just pass int the string of zeros and ones and the base you are converting from (2):You can optionally have the 0b or 0B prefix:If you pass it 0 as the base, it will assume base 10 if the string doesn\'t specify with a prefix:You can pass an integer to bin to see the string representation of a binary literal:And you can combine bin and int to go back and forth:You can use a format specification as well, if you want to have minimum width with preceding zeros:0 in the start here specifies that the base is 8 (not 10), which is pretty easy to see: If you don\'t start with a 0, then python assumes the number is base 10.As far as I can tell Python, up through 2.5, only supports hexadecimal & octal literals.  I did find some discussions about adding binary to future versions but nothing definite.I am pretty sure this is one of the things due to change in Python 3.0 with perhaps bin() to go with hex() and oct().EDIT:\nlbrandy\'s answer is correct in all cases.
