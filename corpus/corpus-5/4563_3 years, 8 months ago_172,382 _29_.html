I have a container that is running the Apache service in the foreground. I would like to be able to access the container from another shell in order to "poke around" inside it and examine the files. At the moment, if I attach to the container, I am left looking at the Apache daemon and cannot run any commands.Is it possible to attach another tty to a running container? Possibly, I can take advantage of the fact that Docker is actually just wrapping around LXC containers? I have tried sudo lxc-console -n [container-id] -t [1-4] but it appears that only one tty is made available and that is the one running the apache daemon. Perhaps there is a way to enable multiple lxc consoles during the build?I would rather not configure and build the container with an openssh service if possible.With docker 1.3, there is a new command docker exec. This allows you to enter a running docker:You should use J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me Petazzoni\'s tool called \'nsenter\' to enter a container without using SSH. See: https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenterInstall with simply running: docker run -v /usr/local/bin:/target jpetazzo/nsenterThen use the command docker-enter <container-id> to enter the container.UpdateAs of docker 0.9, for the steps below to now work, one now has to update the /etc/default/docker file with the \'-e lxc\' to the docker daemon startup option before restarting the daemon (I did this by rebooting the host). This is all because......it [docker 0.9] contains a new "engine driver" abstraction to make possible the use\n  of other API than LXC to start containers. It also provide a new\n  engine driver based on a new API library (libcontainer) which is able\n  to handle Control Groups without using LXC tools. The main issue is\n  that if you are relying on lxc-attach to perform actions on your\n  container, like starting a shell inside the container, which is\n  insanely useful for developpment environment...sourcePlease note that this will prevent the new host only networking optional feature of docker 0.11 from "working" and you will only see the loopback interface. bug report It turns out that the solution to a different question was also the solution to this one:...you can use docker ps -notrunc to get the full lxc container ID and\n  then use lxc-attach -n <container_id> run bash in that container as\n  root.Update: You will soon need to use ps --no-trunc instead of ps -notrunc which is being deprecated.\nFind the full container ID\nEnter the lxc attach command.\nTop shows my apache process running that docker started.nsenter does that. However I also needed to enter a container in a simple way and nsenter didn\'t suffice for my needs. It was buggy in some occasions (black screen plus -wd flag not working). Furthermore I wanted to login as a specific user and in a specific directory.I ended up making my own tool to enter containers. You can find it at: https://github.com/Pithikos/docker-enterIts usage is as easy asThe "nsinit" way is:install nsinitfrom inside the container:from outside:use itWhat about running tmux/GNU Screen within the container?\nSeems the smoother way to access as many vty as you want with a simple:
