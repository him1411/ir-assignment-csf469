I want to create a couple of batch files to automate some thing.My question is when I create a batch file. What is the current directory?\nIs it the directory where the file is located or is it the same directory that appears in cmd?From within your batch file:It usually is the directory from which the batch file is started, but if you start the batch file from a shortcut, a different starting directory could be given. Also, when you\'r in cmd, and your current directory is c:\\dir3, you can still start the batch file using c:\\dir1\\dir2\\batch.bat in which case, the current directory will be c:\\dir3.It is the directory from where you start the batch file. E.g. if your batch is in c:\\dir1\\dir2 and you do cd c:\\dir3, then run the batch, the current directory will be c:\\dir3.Say you were opening a file in your current directory. The command would be:I hope I answered your question.In a batch file, %cd% is the most commonly used command for the current directory, although you can set your own variable:So say you were wanting to open Myprog.exe. If it was in the same folder, you would use the command:That would open Myprog from the current folder.The other option is to make a directory in C: called AutomatePrograms. Then, you transfer your files to that folder then you can open them using the following command:It is the directory from where you run the command to execute your batch file.As mentioned in the above answers you can add the below command to your script to verify:
