I am downloading a file using the wget command. But when it downloads to my local machine, I want it to be saved as a different filename.For example: I am downloading a file from www.examplesite.com/textfile.txtI want to use wget to save the file textfile.txt on my local directory as newfile.txt. I am using the wget command as follows:Use the -O file option. E.g.vs.Also notice the order of parameters in the command line. At least on my linux (Centos6):wget -O FILE URLworks. But:wget URL -O FILEwon\'t give you the right output filename.You would use the command Mechanical snail listed. Notice the uppercase O. Full command line to use could be:wget www.examplesite.com/textfile.txt --output-document=newfile.txtorwget www.examplesite.com/textfile.txt -O newfile.txtHope that helps.Using CentOS Linux I found that the easiest syntax would be:where "link" is the web address you want to save and "file.ext" is the filename and extension of your choice.
