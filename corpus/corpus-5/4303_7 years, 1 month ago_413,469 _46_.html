Just to be clear, I\'m not looking for the MIME type.Let\'s say I have the following input: /path/to/file/foo.txtI\'d like a way to break this input up, specifically into .txt for the extension.  Is there any built in way to do this in Java?  I would like to avoid writing my own parser.In this case, use FilenameUtils.getExtension from Apache Commons IOHere is an example of how to use it (you may specify either full path or just file name):Do you really need a "parser" for this?Assuming that you\'re dealing with simple Windows-like file names, not something like archive.tar.gz.Btw, for the case that a directory may have a \'.\', but the filename itself doesn\'t (like /path/to.a/file), you can doIf you use Guava library, you can resort to Files utility class. It has a specific method, getFileExtension(). For instance:In addition you may also obtain the filename with a similar function, getNameWithoutExtension():If on Android, you can use this:In order to take into account file names without characters before the dot, you have to use that slight variation of the accepted answer:My dirty and may tiniest using String.replaceAll:Note that first * is greedy so it will grab most possible characters as far as it can and then just last dot and file extension will be left.If you plan to use Apache commons-io,and just want to check the file\'s extension and then do some operation,you can use this,here is a snippet:How about (using Java 1.5 RegEx):How about JFileChooser? It is not straightforward as you will need to parse its final output...which is a MIME type...OK...I forget that you don\'t want to know its MIME type.Interesting code in the following link:\nhttp://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/filechooser.htmlRelated question:\nHow do I trim a file extension from a String in Java?Here\'s a method that handles .tar.gz properly, even in a path with dots in directory names:afterLastSlash is created to make finding afterLastBackslash quicker since it won\'t have to search the whole string if there are some slashes in it.The char[] inside the original String is reused, adding no garbage there, and the JVM will probably notice that afterLastSlash is immediately garbage in order to put it on the stack instead of the heap.This is a tested methodAnd test case:Here I made a small method (however not that secure and doesnt check for many errors), but if it is only you that is programming a general java-program, this is more than enough to find the filetype. This is not working for complex filetypes, but those are normally not used as much. extension should have ".txt" in it when run.Getting File Extension from File NameCreditsHere\'s the version with Optional as a return value (cause you can\'t be sure the file has an extension)... also sanity checks... How about REGEX version:or with null extension supported:result for *nix:\npath: /root/docs/\nname: readme\nExtention: txtfor windows, parsePath("c:\\windows\\readme.txt"):\npath: c:\\windows\\\nname: readme\nExtention: txtWithout use of any library, you can use the String method split as follows :Just a regular-expression based alternative. Not that fast, not that good. This particular question gives me a lot trouble then i found a very simple solution for this problem which i\'m posting here.That\'s it.return ".txt"if you want only "txt", make path.lastIndexOf(".") + 1You can use the Java7 feature from java.io packageRefer the below code snippetJava has a built-in way of dealing with this, in the java.nio.file.Files class, that may work for your needs:Note that this static method uses the specifications found here to retrieve "content type," which can vary.let \'name\' be the name of the file with extension file.
