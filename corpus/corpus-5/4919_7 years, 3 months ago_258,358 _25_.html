Okay, this is really confusing me. I have some content inside of a div like so:However, the content overflows the DIV (as expected) because the \'word\' is too long.How can I force the browser to \'break\' the word where necessary to fit all of the content inside?Use word-wrap:break-word; It even works in IE6, which is a pleasant surprise.I am not sure about the browser compatabilityAlso you can use <wbr> tag<wbr> (word break) means: "The browser\n  may insert a line break here, if it\n  wishes." It the browser does not think\n  a line break necessary nothing\n  happens.This could be added to the accepted answer for a \'cross-browser\' solution.Sources:I was just Googling the same issue, and posted my final solution HERE.  It\'s relevant to this question too, so I hope you don\'t mind the repost.You can do this easily with a DIV by giving it the style word-wrap: break-word (and you may need to set its width, too).  However, for tables, you also need to apply: table-layout: fixed.  This means the columns widths are no longer fluid, but are defined based on the widths of the columns in the first row only (or via specified widths). Read more here.Sample code:Hope that helps somebody.&#8203; is the HTML entity for a unicode character called the zero-width space (ZWSP) which is an invisible character which specifies a line-break opportunity.  Similarly the hyphen\'s purpose is to specify a line-break opportunity within a word boundary.CSS word-wrap:break-word;, tested in FireFox 3.6.3Found that using the following worked across most major browsers (Chrome, IE, Safari iOS/OSX) except Firefox (v50.0.2) when using flex-box and relying on width: auto.note: you may need to add browser vendor prefixes if you are not using an autoprefixer.Another thing to watch out for is text using &nbsp; for spacing can cause line breaks mid-word.First you should identify the width of your element. Eg:so that when the text reaches the element width, it will be broken down into lines.I solved my problem with code below.just try this in our styleDo this:
