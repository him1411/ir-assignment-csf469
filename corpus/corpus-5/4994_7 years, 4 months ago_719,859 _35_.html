This question already has an answer here:If the value is 200.3456, it should be formatted to 200.34.\nIf it is 200, then it should be 200.00.Here\'s an utility that rounds (instead of truncating) a double to specified number of decimal places.For example:This breaks down badly in corner cases with either a very high number of decimal places (e.g. round(1000.0d, 17)) or large integer part (e.g. round(90080070060.1d, 9)). Thanks to Sloin for pointing this out.I\'ve been using the above to round "not-too-big" doubles to 2 or 3 decimal places happily for years (for example to clean up time in seconds for logging purposes: 27.987654321987 -> 27.99). But I guess it\'s best to avoid it, since more reliable ways are readily available, with cleaner code too. (Adapted from this answer by Louis Wasserman and this one by Sean Owen.)Note that HALF_UP is the rounding mode "commonly taught at school". Peruse the RoundingMode documentation, if you suspect you need something else such as Bankers\xe2\x80\x99 Rounding.Of course, if you prefer, you can inline the above into a one-liner:\nnew BigDecimal(value).setScale(places, RoundingMode.HALF_UP).doubleValue()Always remember that floating point representations using float and double are inexact. \nFor example, consider these expressions: For exactness, you want to use BigDecimal. And while at it, use the constructor that takes a String, never the one taking double. For instance, try executing this:Some excellent further reading on the topic:If you wanted String formatting instead of (or in addition to) strictly rounding numbers, see the other answers.  Specifically, note that round(200, 0) returns 200.0. If you want to output "200.00", you should first round and then format the result for output (which is perfectly explained in Jesper\'s answer).If you just want to print a double with two digits after the decimal point, use something like this:If you want to have the result in a String instead of being printed to the console, use String.format() with the same arguments:Or use class DecimalFormat:I think this is easier:Note that this will actually do the rounding for you, not just formatting.The easiest way, would be to do a trick like this;if val starts at 200.3456 then it goes to 20034.56 then it gets rounded to 20035 then we divide it to get 200.34.if you wanted to always round down we could always truncate by casting to an int:This technique will work for most cases because for very large doubles (positive or negative) it may overflow. but if you know that your values will be in an appropriate range then this should work for you.Please use Apache commons math:Note the toString()!!!!This is because BigDecimal converts the exact binary form of the double!!!These are the various suggested methods and their fail cases.If you really want the same double, but rounded in the way you want you can use BigDecimal, for exampleRounding a double is usually not what one wants. Instead, use String.format() to represent it in the desired format.For two rounding digits. Very simple and you are basically updating the variable instead of just display purposes which DecimalFormat does.x = Math.floor(x * 100) / 100;in your question it seems that you want to avoid rounding the numbers as well? i think .format() will round the numbers using half-up, afaik?\nso if you want rounding, 200.3456 should be 200.35 for a precision of 2. but in your case, if you just want the first 2 and then discard the rest... ??:  you could multiply it by 100 and then cast to an int (or taking the floor of the number), before dividing by 100 again.  200.3456 * 100 = 20034.56;\n(int) 20034.56 = 20034;\n20034/100.0 = 200.34;you might have issues with really really big numbers close to the boundary though. in which case converting to a string and substring\'ing it would work just as easily.
