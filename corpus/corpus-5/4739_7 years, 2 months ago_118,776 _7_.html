I want to do a diff between two tags and committed changes between those two tags, could you please tell me the command?or show log between them:sometimes it may be convenient to see only the list of files that were changed:and then look at the differences for some particular file:A tag is only a reference to the latest commit \'on that tag\', so that you are doing a diff on the commits between them.Also, a good reference: http://learn.github.com/p/diff.htmlIf source code is on Github, you can use their comparing tool: https://help.github.com/articles/comparing-commits-across-time/
