I have a Struts2 action in the server side for file downloading.However when I call the action using the jQuery:in Firebug I see the data is retrieved with the Binary stream. I wonder how to open the file downloading window with which the user can save the file locally?Bluish is completely right about this, you can\'t do it through Ajax because JavaScript cannot save files directly to a user\'s computer (out of security concerns). Unfortunately pointing the main window\'s URL at your file download means you have little control over what the user experience is when a file download occurs.I created jQuery File Download which allows for an "Ajax like" experience with file downloads complete with OnSuccess and OnFailure callbacks to provide for a better user experience. Take a look at my blog post on the common problem that the plugin solves and some ways to use it and also a demo of jQuery File Download in action. Here is the sourceHere is a simple use case demo using the plugin source with promises. The demo page includes many other, \'better UX\' examples as well.Depending on what browsers you need to support you may be able to use https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/ which allows more explicit control than the IFRAME method jQuery File Download uses.Noone posted this @Pekka\'s solution... so I\'ll post it. It can help someone.You can\'t and don\'t need to do this through Ajax. Just use1. Framework agnostic: Servlet downloading file as attachment2. Struts2 Framework: Action downloading file as attachmentIt would be better to use <s:a> tag pointing with OGNL to an URL created with <s:url> tag:In the above cases, you need to write the Content-Disposition header to the response, specifying that the file needs to be downloaded (attachment) and not opened by the browser (inline). You need to specify the Content Type too, and you may want to add the file name and length (to help the browser drawing a realistic progressbar). For example, when downloading a ZIP:With Struts2 (unless you are using the Action as a Servlet, an hack for direct streaming, for example), you don\'t need to directly write anything to the response; simply using the Stream result type and configuring it in struts.xml will work: EXAMPLE3. Framework agnostic (/ Struts2 framework): Servlet(/Action) opening file inside the browserIf you want to open the file inside the browser, instead of downloading it, the Content-disposition must be set to inline, but the target can\'t be the current window location; you must target a new window created by javascript, an <iframe> in the page, or a new window created on-the-fly with the "discussed" target="_blank":I have created little function as workaround solution (inspired by @JohnCulviner plugin):Demo with click event:You can with HTML5NB: The file data returned MUST be base64 encoded because you cannot JSON encode binary dataIn my AJAX response I have a data structure that looks like this:That means that I can do the following to save a file via AJAXThe function base64ToBlob was taken from here and must be used in compliance with this function This is good if your server is dumping filedata to be saved. However, I\'ve not quite worked out how one would implement a HTML4 fallbackOk, based on ndpu\'s code heres an improved (I think) version of ajax_download;-Use this like this;-The params are sent as proper post params as if coming from an input rather than as a json encoded string as per the previous example.CAVEAT: Be wary about the potential for variable injection on those forms. There might be a safer way to encode those variables. Alternatively contemplate escaping them.I faced the same issue and successfully solved it. My use-case is this."Post JSON data to the server and receive an excel file.\nThat excel file is created by the server and returned as a response to the client. Download that response as a file with custom name in browser"The above snippet is just doing followingHere we need to carefully set few things on the server side. I set few headers in Python Django HttpResponse. You need to set them accordingly if you use other programming languages.Since I download xls(excel) here, I adjusted contentType to above one. You need to set it according to your file type. You can use this technique to download any kind of files.Here is what I did, pure javascript and html. Did not test it but this should work in all browsers.Javascript FunctionUsing just components that is supported in all browsers no additional\n  libraries.\nHere is my server side JAVA Spring controller code.Adding some more things to  above answer for downloading a fileBelow is some java spring code which generates byte ArrayNow in  javascript code using FileSaver.js ,can download a file with below code The above will download file Ok so here is the working code when Using MVC and you are getting your file from a controllerlets say you have your byte array declare and populate,  the only thing you need to do is to use the File function (using System.Web.Mvc)and then,  in the same controller,  add thoses 2 functionsand then you will be able to call your controller to download and get the "success" or "failure" callbackIf you want to use  jQuery File Download , please note this for IE.\nYou need to reset the response or it will not downloadYour action can implement ServletResponseAware  to access getServletResponse() The simple way to make the browser downloads a file is to make the request like that:This opens the browser download pop up.In Rails, I do it this way: The trick is the window.location part. The controller\'s method looks like:
