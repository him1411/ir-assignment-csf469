How do I auto increment the primary key in a SQL Server database table, I\'ve had a look through the forum but can\'t see how.I\'ve looked the the properties but can\'t see an option, I have seen an answer where you go to the Identity specification property and set it to yes and set the Identity increment to 1, but that section is grayed out and I can\'t change the no to yes.There must be a simple way to do this but I can\'t find it. Make sure that the Key column\'s datatype is int and then setting identity manually, as image showsOr  just run this codethe code will run, if ID is not the  only column in the tableimage reference fifo\'sWhen you\'re creating the table, you can create an IDENTITY column as follows:The IDENTITY property will auto-increment the column up from number 1. (Note that the data type of the column has to be an integer.) If you want to add this to an existing column, use an ALTER TABLE command.Edit:\nTested a bit, and I can\'t find a way to change the Identity properties via the Column Properties window for various tables. I guess if you want to make a column an identity column, you HAVE to use an ALTER TABLE command.You have to expand the Identity section to expose increment and seed.Edit: I assumed that you\'d have an integer datatype, not char(10). Which is reasonable I\'d say and valid when I posted this answerExpand your database, expand your table right click on your table and select design from dropdown.\nNow go Column properties below of it scroll down and find Identity Specification, expand it and you will find Is Identity make it Yes. Now choose Identity Increment right below of it give the value you want to increment in it.\nPerhaps I\'m missing something but why doesn\'t this work with the SEQUENCE object?  Is this not what you\'re looking for?Example:When referencing the squence in say an INSERT command just use:More information and options for SEQUENCEWhen you\'re using Data Type: int you can select the row which you want to get autoincremented and go to the column properties tag. There you can set the identity to \'yes\'. The starting value for autoincrement can also be edited there. Hope I could help ;)Be carefull like if you want the ID elements to be contigius or not. As SQLSERVER ID can jump by 1000 .Examle: before restart   ID=11\nafter restart  , you insert new row in the table, then the id will be 1012.If the table is already populated it is not possible to change a column to IDENTITY column or convert it to non IDENTITY column. You would need to export all the data out then you can change column type to IDENTITY or vice versa and then import data back.\nI know it is painful process but I believe there is no alternative except for using sequence as mentioned in this post.
