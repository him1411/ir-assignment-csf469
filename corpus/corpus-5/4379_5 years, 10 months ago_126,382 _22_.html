When programming in Node.js and referencing files that are located somewhere in relation to your current directory, is there any reason to use the __dirname variable instead of just a regular ./? I\'ve been using ./ thus far in my code and just discovered the existence of __dirname, and essentially want to know whether it would be smart to convert my ./\'s to that, and if so, why that would be a smart idea.In Node.js, __dirname is always the directory in which the currently executing script resides (see this). So if you typed __dirname into /d1/d2/myscript.js, the value would be /d1/d2.By contrast, . gives you the directory from which you ran the node command in your terminal window (i.e. your working directory).The exception is when you use . with require(). The path inside require is always relative to the file containing the call to require.Let\'s say your directory structure isand pathtest.js containsand you doyou getYour working directory is /dir1/dir2 so that\'s what . resolves to. Since pathtest.js is located in /dir1/dir2 that\'s what __dirname resolves to as well.However, if you run the script from /dir1you getIn that case, your working directory was /dir1 so that\'s what . resolved to, but __dirname still resolves to /dir1/dir2.If inside dir2/pathtest.js you have a require call into include a file inside dir1 you would always dobecause the path inside require is always relative to the file in which you are calling it. It has nothing to do with your working directory../ refers to the current working directory, except in the require() function. When using require(), it translates ./ to the directory of the current file called. __dirname is always the directory of the current file.For example, with the following file structure/home/user/dir/files/config.json/home/user/dir/files/somefile.txt/home/user/dir/dir.jsIf I cd into /home/user/dir and run node dir.js I will getBut when I run the same script from /home/user/ I getUsing ./ worked with require but not for fs.readFileSync. That\'s because for fs.readFileSync, ./ translates into the cwd (in this case /home/user/). And /home/user/files/somefile.txt does not exist.
