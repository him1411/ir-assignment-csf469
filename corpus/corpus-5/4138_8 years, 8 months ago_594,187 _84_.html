To be specific, I was trying this code:But it gave the error Cannot access non-static field in static method mainSo I changed the declaration of clock to this:And it worked. What does it mean to put that keyword before the declaration? What exactly will it do and/or restrict in terms of what can be done to that object?static members belong to the class instead of a specific instance.It means that only one instance of a static field exists[1] even if you create a million instances of the class or you don\'t create any. It will be shared by all instances.Since static methods also do not belong to a specific instance, they can\'t refer to instance members (how would you know which instance Hello class you want to refer to?). static members can only refer to static members. Instance members can, of course access static members.Side note: Of course, static members can access instance members through an object reference.Example:[1]: Depending on the runtime characteristics, it can be one per ClassLoader or AppDomain or thread, but that is beside the point.It means that there is only one instance of "clock" in Hello, not one per each separate instance of the "Hello" class, or more-so, it means that there will be one commonly shared "clock" reference among all instances of the "Hello" class.So if you were to do a "new Hello" anywhere in your code:\nA- in the first scenario (before the change, without using "static"), it would make a new clock every time a "new Hello" is called, but \nB- in the second scenario (after the change, using "static"), every "new Hello" instance would still share and use the initial and same "clock" reference first created.Unless you needed "clock" somewhere outside of main, this would work just as well:The static keyword means that something (a field, method or nested class) is related to the type rather than any particular instance of the type. So for example, one calls Math.sin(...) without any instance of the Math class, and indeed you can\'t create an instance of the Math class.For more information, see the relevant bit of Oracle\'s Java Tutorial.SidenoteJava unfortunately allows you to access static members as if they were instance members, e.g.That makes it look as if sleep is an instance method, but it\'s actually a static method - it always makes the current thread sleep. It\'s better practice to make this clear in the calling code:The static keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all instances of that class as it belongs to the type, not the actual objects themselves.So if you have a variable: private static int i = 0; and you increment it (i++) in one instance, the change will be reflected in all instances. i will now be 1 in all instances.Static methods can be used without instantiating an object.It means you don\'t have to have an instance of the class to use the method. So in your example, you could call:directly, instead of:EditFrom inside a static method (one belonging only to the class) you cannot access any members which are not static, since their values depend on your instantiation of the class. So Clock, which is an instance member, would have a different value/reference for each instance of your Hello class, and therefore you could not access it from the static portion of the class.Basic usage of static members...That\'s how you can have values shared in all class members without sending class instance Hello to other class. And whit static you don\'t need to create class instance.You can just call static values or methods by class name:This discussion has so far ignored classloader considerations. Strictly speaking, Java static fields are shared between all instances of a class for a given classloader.Static in Java:Static is a Non Access Modifier.\nThe static keyword belongs to the class than instance of the class.\ncan be used to attach a Variable or Method to a Class.Static keyword CAN be used with:MethodVariableClass nested within another ClassInitialization BlockCAN\'T be used with:Class (Not Nested)ConstructorInterfacesMethod Local Inner Class(Difference then  nested class)Inner Class methodsInstance VariablesLocal VariablesExample:Imagine the following example which has an instance variable named count which in incremented in the constructor:Output:1 1 1Since instance variable gets the memory at the time of object creation, each object will have the copy of the instance variable, if it is incremented, it won\'t reflect to other objects. Now if we change the instance variable count to a static one then the program will produce different output:Output:1 2 3In this case static variable will get the memory only once, if any object changes the value of the static variable, it will retain its value.Static with Final:The global variable which is declared as final and static remains unchanged for the whole execution. Because, Static members are stored in the class memory and they are loaded only once in the whole execution. They are common to all objects of the class. If you declare static variables as final, any of the objects can\xe2\x80\x99t change their value as it is final. Therefore, variables declared as final and static are sometimes referred to as Constants. All fields of interfaces are referred as constants, because they are final and static by default.Picture Resource : Final StaticA field can be assigned to either the class or an instance of a class. By default fields are instance variables. By using static the field becomes a class variable, thus there is one and only one clock. If you make a changes in one place, it\'s visible everywhere. Instance varables are changed independently of one another.In Java, the static keyword can be simply regarded as indicating the following:"without regard or relationship to any particular instance"If you think of static in this way, it becomes easier to understand its use in the various contexts in which it is encountered:A static field is a field that belongs to the class rather than to any particular instanceA static method is a method that has no notion of this; it is defined on the class and doesn\'t know about any particular instance of that class unless a reference is passed to itA static member class is a nested class without any notion or knowledge of an instance of its enclosing class (unless a reference to an enclosing class instance is passed to it)static methods don\'t use any instance variables of the class they are defined in.  A very good explanation of the difference can be found on this pageI have developed a liking for static methods (only, if possible) in "helper" classes.The calling class need not create another member (instance) variable of the helper class. You just call the methods of the helper class. Also the helper class is improved because you no longer need a constructor, and you need no member (instance) variables.There are probably other advantages.The keyword static is used to denote a field or a method as belonging to the class itself and not the instance.  Using your code, if the object Clock is static, all of the instances of the Hello class will share this Clock data member (field) in common.  If you make it non-static, each individual instance of Hello can have a unique Clock field.The problem is that you added a main method to your class Hello so that you could run the code.  The problem here is that the main method is static and as such, it cannot refer to non-static fields or methods inside of it.  You can resolve this in two ways:For you, this means the following change to your code:Static makes the clock member a class member instead of an instance member. Without the static keyword you would need to create an instance of the Hello class (which has a clock member variable) - e.g.Can also think of static members not having a "this" pointer. They are shared among all instances.Here Main is the static method and there are two main restrictions of static method:this and super cannot be used in static context.Output:Compile Time ErrorTo add to existing answers, let me try with a picture:Understanding Static concepts Second ClassStatic Variables Can only be accessed only in static methods, so when we declare the static variables those getter and setter methods will be static methodsstatic methods is a class level we can access using class nameThe following is  example for Static Variables Getters And Setters:
