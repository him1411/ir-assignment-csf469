I removed the old grunt first,and I install the new grunt.But I got an error:D:\\www\\grunt-test\\grunt grunt-cli: The grunt command line interface.\n  (v0.1.4)Fatal error: Unable to find local grunt.If you\'re seeing this message, either a Gruntfile wasn\'t found or\n  grunt hasn\'t been installed locally to your project. For more\n  information about installing and configuring grunt, please see the\n  Getting Started guide: http://gruntjs.com/getting-startedIs there haven\'t a grunt in my system path, or something else? I tried to re-install it for few times.I think you don\'t have a grunt.js file in your project directory.  Use grunt:init, which gives you options such as jQuery, node,commonjs.  Select what you want, then proceed.  This really works. For more information you can visit this.Do this: It should work.Solution for v1.4:Edit : Updated solution for new versions: Unable to find local Grunt likely means that you have installed Grunt globally. The Grunt CLI insists that you install grunt in your local node_modules directory, so Grunt is local to your project. This will fail:Do this instead:Doto install Grunt locally in ./node_modules (and everything else specified in the package.json file)If you already have a file package.json in the project and it contains grunt in dependency, Then you can run npm install to resolve the issueCould be a few problems here depending on what version of grunt is being used. Newer versions of grunt actually specify that you have a file named Gruntfile.js (instead of the old grunt.js). You should have the grunt-cli tool be installed globally (this is done via npm install -g grunt-cli). This allows you to actually run grunt commands from the command line. Secondly make sure you\'ve installed grunt locally for your project. If you see your package.json doesn\'t have something like "grunt": "0.4.5" in it then you should do npm install grunt --save in your project directory. I made the mistake to install some packages using sudo and other without privileges , this fixed my problem.hope it helps someone.It says you don\'t have a local grunt so try:npm install grunt(without the -g it\'s a local grunt)Though not directly related, make sure you have Gruntfile.js in your current folder.I had to execute the following commands on ubuntu to solve this problem (I know grunt for 1 hour) :It is dirty but it is the only one solution I found... :(Being new to grunt and setting it up, I am running (perhaps foolishly) my grunt project/folder from a Google Drive so I can access the same code/builds from either my laptop or workstation. There is a fair bit of synchronisation of the nodes_modules folders back to Google Drive and there seemed to be a conflict at some point, and the /nodes_modules/grunt folder was renamed to /nodes_modules/grunt (1)Renaming it back by removing the (1) seemed to fix it for me.Just npm install to install node_modules
