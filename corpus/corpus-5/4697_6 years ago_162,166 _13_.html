I\'m trying to use cURL in a script and get it to not show the progress bar. I\'ve tried the -s, -silent, -S, and -quiet options, but none of them work.Here\'s a typical command I\'ve tried:I only get the progress bar when pushing it to a file, so curl -s http://google.com doesn\'t have a progress bar, but curl -s http://google.com > temp.html does.works for curl version 7.19.5 on Ubuntu 9.10 (no progress bar). But if for some reason that does not work on your platform, you could always redirect stderr to /dev/null:In curl version 7.22.0 on Ubuntu and 7.24.0 on OSX the solution to not show progress but to show errors is to use both -s and -S like so:This works for both redirected output > /some/file, piped output | less and outputting directly to the terminal for me.I found that with curl 7.18.2 the download progress bar is not hidden with:but it is with:This works for curl 7.22.0 on Ubuntu 12.04:Actually it also works with any number of \'s\'. You may write:and the effect will be the same =)Not sure why it\'s doing that. Try -s with the -o option to set the output file instead of >.
