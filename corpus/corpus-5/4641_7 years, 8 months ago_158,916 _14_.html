I bind two event handlers on this link:JavaScript:Is there any way to get a list of all events bound on an element, in this case on element with id="elm"?In modern versions of jQuery, you would use the $._data method to find any events attached by jQuery to the element in question. Note, this is an internal-use only method:The result from $._data will be an object that contains both of the events we set (pictured below with the mouseout property expanded):Then in Chrome, you may right click the handler function and click "view function definition" to show you the exact spot where it is defined in your code.Similarly, you can right click on the target element -> select "inspect element" Scroll down on the right side of the dev frame, at the bottom is \'event listeners\'. Expand the tree to see what events are attached to the element. Not sure if this works for events that are handled through bubbling (I\'m guessing not)I\'m adding this for posterity; There\'s an easier way that doesn\'t involve writing more JS. Using the amazing firebug addon for firefox, The jQuery Audit plugin plugin should let you do this through the normal Chrome Dev Tools. It\'s not perfect, but it should let you see the actual handler bound to the element/event and not just the generic jQuery handler.I used something like this if($._data($("a.wine-item-link")[0]).events == null) { ... do something, pretty much bind their event handlers again } to check if my element is bound to any event. It will still say undefined (null) if you have unattached all your event handlers from that element. That is the reason why I am evaluating this in an if expression.When I pass a little complex DOM query to $._data like this: $._data($(\'#outerWrap .innerWrap ul li:last a\'), \'events\') it throws undefined in the browser console.So I had to use $._data on the parent div: $._data($(\'#outerWrap\')[0], \'events\') to see the events for the a tags. Here is a JSFiddle for the same: http://jsfiddle.net/giri_jeedigunta/MLcpT/4/
