In Git, how could I search for a file or directory by path across a number of branches?I\'ve written something in a branch, but I don\'t remember which one.  Now I need to find it.Clarification:  I\'m looking for a file which I created on one of my branches.  I\'d like to find it by path, and not by its contents, as I don\'t remember what the contents are.git log will find it for you:Supports globbing, too:The single quotes are necessary (at least if using the bash shell) so the shell passes the glob pattern to git unchanged, instead of expanding it (just like with Unix find).git ls-tree might help. To search across all existing branches:The advantage of this is that you can also search with regular expressions for the file name.Although @ididak response is pretty cool, and @Handyman5 provides a script to use it, I found little restricted that approach.Sometimes you need to search for something that can appear/disappear over time, so why not search against all commits?  Besides that, sometimes you need a verbose response, other times only commit matches. Here are two versions of those options.  Put these scripts on your path:git-find-filegit-find-file-verbose Now you can doSee that using getopt you can modify that script to alternate searching all commits, refs, refs/heads, been verbose, etc.Checkout https://github.com/albfan/git-find-file for a possible implementationYou could use gitk --all and search for commits "touching paths" and the pathname you are interested in.Copy & paste this to use git find-file SEARCHPATTERNPrinting all searched branches:Print only branches with results:These commands will add some minimal shell scripts directly to your ~/.gitconfig as global git alias.A quite decent implementation of the find command for git repositories can be found here: https://github.com/mirabilos/git-find
