I\'d like to get the names of all the keys in a MongoDB collection.For example, from this:I\'d like to get the unique keys:You could do this with MapReduce:Then run distinct on the resulting collection so as to find all the keys:With Kristina\'s answer as inspiration, I created an open source tool called Variety which does exactly this: https://github.com/variety/varietyTry this:Using python.  Returns the set of all top-level keys in the collection:If your target collection is not too large, you can try this under mongo shell client:Here is the sample worked in Python:\nThis sample returns the results inline.You can use aggregation with new $objectToArrray in 3.4.4 version to convert all top key & value pair into document arrays followed by $unwind & $group with $addToSet to get distinct keys across entire collection.$$ROOT for referencing the top level document.You can use below query for getting keys in a single document.This works fine for me:I extended Carlos LM\'s solution a bit so it\'s more detailed.Example of a schema:Type into the console:Run:OutputI have 1 simpler work around...What you can do is while inserting data/document into your main collection "things" you must insert the attributes in 1 separate collection lets say "things_attributes".so every time you insert in "things", you do get from "things_attributes" compare values of that document with your new document keys if any new key present append it in that document and again re-insert it.So things_attributes will have only 1 document of unique keys which you can easily get when ever you require by using findOne()
