To test whether a number is prime or not, why do we have to test whether it is divisible only up to the square root of that number?If a number n is not a prime, it can be factored into two factors a and b:If both a and b were greater than the square root of n, a*b would be greater than n.  So at least one of those factors must be less than or equal to the square root of n, and to check if n is prime, we only need to test for factors less than or equal to the square root.Let\'s say m = sqrt(n) then m \xc3\x97 m = n. Now if n is not a prime then n can be written as n = a \xc3\x97 b, so m \xc3\x97 m = a \xc3\x97 b. Notice that m is a real number whereas n, a and b are natural numbers.Now there can be 3 cases:In all 3 cases, min(a, b) \xe2\x89\xa4 m. Hence if we search till m, we are bound to find at least one factor of n, which is enough to show that n is not prime.Because if a factor is greater than the square root of n, the other factor that would multiply with it to equal n is necessarily less than the square root of n.A more intuitive explanation would be :-The square root of 100 is 10. Let\'s say a x b = 100, for various pairs of a and b.If a == b, then they are equal, and are the square root of 100, exactly. Which is 10.If one of them is less than 10, the other has to be greater. For example, 5 x 20 == 100. One is greater than 10, the other is less than 10.Thinking about a x b, if one of them goes down, the other must get bigger to compensate, so the product stays at 100. They pivot around the square root.The square root of 101 is about 10.049875621. So if you\'re testing the number 101 for primality, you only need to try the integers up through 10, including 10. But 8, 9, and 10 are not themselves prime, so you only have to test up through 7, which is prime.Because if there\'s a pair of factors with one of the numbers bigger than 10, the other of the pair has to be less than 10. If the smaller one doesn\'t exist, there is no matching larger factor of 101.If you\'re testing 121, the square root is 11. You have to test the prime integers 1 through 11 (inclusive) to see if it goes in evenly. 11 goes in 11 times, so 121 is not prime. If you had stopped at 10, and not tested 11, you would have missed 11.You have to test every prime integer greater than 2, but less than or equal to the square root, assuming you are only testing odd numbers.`Suppose n is not a prime number (greater than 1). So there are numbers a and b such thatBy multiplying the relation a<=b by a and b we get:Therefore: (note that n=ab)Hence: (Note that a and b are positive)So if a number (greater than 1) is not prime and we test divisibility up to square root of the number, we will find one of the factors.It\'s all really just basic uses of Factorization and Square Roots.It may appear to be abstract, but in reality it simply lies with the fact that a non-prime-number\'s maximum possible factorial would have to be its square root because:sqrroot(n) * sqrroot(n) = n.Given that, if any whole number above 1 and below or up to sqrroot(n) divides evenly into n, then n cannot be a prime number.Pseudo-code example:Let\'s suppose that the given integer N is not prime,Then N can be factorized into two factors a and b ,   2 <= a, b < N such that N = a*b.\nClearly, both of them can\'t be greater than sqrt(N) simultaneously. Let us assume without loss of generality that a is smaller.Now, if you could not find any divisor of N belonging in the range [2, sqrt(N)], what does that mean?This means that N does not have any divisor in [2, a] as a <= sqrt(N). Therefore, a = 1 and b = n and hence By definition, N is prime....Further reading if you are not satisfied:Many different combinations of (a, b) may be possible. Let\'s say they are:(a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3, b3), ..... , (ak, bk). Without loss of generality, assume ai < bi, 1<= i <=k.Now, to be able to show that N is not prime it is sufficient to show that none of ai can be factorized further. And we also know that ai <= sqrt(N) and thus you need to check till sqrt(N) which will cover all ai. And hence you will be able to conclude whether or not N is prime....Let n be non-prime. Therefore, it has at least two integer factors greater than 1. Let f be the smallest of n\'s such factors. Suppose f > sqrt n. Then n/f is an integer LTE sqrt n, thus smaller than f. Therefore, f cannot be n\'s smallest factor. Reductio ad absurdum; n\'s smallest factor must be LTE sqrt n.Let\'s say we have a number "a", which is not prime [not prime/composite number means - a number which can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 or itself. For example, 6 can be divided evenly by 2, or by 3, as well as by 1 or 6]. 6 = 1 \xc3\x97 6  or  6 = 2 \xc3\x97 3So now if "a" is not prime then it can be divided by two other numbers and let\'s say those numbers are "b" and "c". Which means a=b*c.Now if "b" or "c" , any of them is greater than square root of "a "than multiplication of "b" & "c" will be greater than "a". So, "b" & "c" is always <= square root of "a" to prove the equation "a=b*c".Because of the above reason, when we test if a number is prime or not, we only check until square root of that  number.So to check whether a number N is Prime or not.\nWe need to only check if N is divisible by numbers<=SQROOT(N). This is because, if we factor N into any 2 factors say X and Y, ie. N=XY. \nEach of X and Y cannot be less than SQROOT(N) because then, XY < N \nEach of X and Y cannot be greater than SQROOT(N) because then, X*Y > N Therefore one factor must be less than or equal to SQROOT(N) ( while the other factor is greater than or equal to SQROOT(N) ). \nSo to check if N is Prime we need only check those numbers <= SQROOT(N).To test the primality of a number, n, one would expect a loop such as following in the first place : What the above loop does is this : for a given 1 < i < n, it checks if n/i is an integer (leaves remainder 0). If there exists an i for which n/i is an integer, then we can be sure that n is not a prime number, at which point the loop terminates. If for no i, n/i is an integer, then n is prime.  As with every algorithm, we ask : Can we do better ?Let us see what is going on in the above loop. The sequence of i goes : i = 2, 3, 4, ... , n-1And the sequence of integer-checks goes : j = n/i, which is n/2, n/3, n/4, ... , n/(n-1) If for some i = a, n/a is an integer, then n/a = k (integer)or n = ak, clearly n > k > 1 (if k = 1, then a = n, but i never reaches n; and if k = n, then a = 1, but i starts form 2)Also, n/k = a, and as stated above, a is a value of i so n > a > 1. So, a and k are both integers between 1 and n (exclusive). Since, i reaches every integer in that range, at some iteration i = a, and at some other iteration i = k. If the primality test of n fails for min(a,k), it will also fail for max(a,k). So we need to check only one of these two cases, unless min(a,k) = max(a,k) (where two checks reduce to one) i.e., a = k , at which point a*a = n, which implies a = sqrt(n).In other words, if the primality test of n were to fail for some i >= sqrt(n) (i.e., max(a,k)), then it would also fail for some i <= n (i.e., min(a,k)). So, it would suffice if we run the test for i = 2 to sqrt(n).
