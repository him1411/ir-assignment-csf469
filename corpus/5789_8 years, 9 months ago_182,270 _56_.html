What is the use of anonymous classes in Java? Can we say that usage of anonymous class is one of the advantages of Java?By an "anonymous class", I take it you mean anonymous inner class.An anonymous inner class can come useful when making an instance of an object with certain "extras" such as overloading methods, without having to actually subclass a class.I tend to use it as a shortcut for attaching an event listener:Using this method makes coding a little bit quicker, as I don\'t need to make an extra class that implements ActionListener -- I can just instantiate an anonymous inner class without actually making a separate class.I only use this technique for "quick and dirty" tasks where making an entire class feels unnecessary. Having multiple anonymous inner classes that do exactly the same thing should be refactored to an actual class, be it an inner class or a separate class.Anonymous inner classes are effectively closures, so they can be used to emulate lambda expressions or "delegates". For example, take this interface:You can use this anonymously to create a first-class function in Java. Let\'s say you have the following method that returns the first number larger than i in the given list, or i if no number is larger:And then you have another method that returns the first number smaller than i in the given list, or i if no number is smaller:These methods are almost identical. Using the first-class function type F, we can rewrite these into one method as follows:You can use an anonymous class to use the firstMatch method:This is a really contrived example, but its easy to see that being able to pass functions around as if they were values is a pretty useful feature. See "Can Your Programming Language Do This" by Joel himself.A nice library for programming Java in this style: Functional Java.I use them sometimes as a syntax hack for Map instantiation:vsIt saves some redundancy when doing a lot of put statements. However, I have also run into problems doing this when the outer class needs to be serialized via remoting. Anonymous inner class is used in following scenario:1.)For Overriding(Sub classing) ,When class definition is not usable except current case:2.)For implementing an interface,When implemention of interface is required only for current case:3.)Argument Defined Anonymous inner class:They\'re commonly used as a verbose form of callback.I suppose you could say they\'re an advantage compared to not having them, and having to create a named class every time, but similar concepts are implemented much better in other languages (as closures or blocks)Here\'s a swing exampleAlthough it\'s still messily verbose, it\'s a lot better than forcing you to define a named class for every throw away listener like this (although depending on the situation and reuse, that may still be the better approach)You use it in situations where you need to create a class for a specific purpose inside another function, e.g., as a listener, as a runnable (to spawn a thread), etc.The idea is that you call them from inside the code of a function so you never refer to them elsewhere, so you don\'t need to name them. The compiler just enumerates them.They are essentially syntactic sugar, and should generally be moved elsewhere as they grow bigger.I\'m not sure if it is one of the advantages of Java, though if you do use them (and we all frequently use them, unfortunately), then you could argue that they are one.GuideLines for Anonymous Class.Anonymous class is declared and initialized simultaneously.Anonymous class must extend or implement to one and only one class or interface resp.As anonymouse class has no name, it can be used only once.eg:  This is also one of the example for anonymous inner type using threadYes, anonymous inner classes is definitely one of the advantages of Java.With an anonymous inner class you have access to final and member variables of the surrounding class, and that comes in handy in listeners etc.But a major advantage is that the inner class code, which is (at least should be) tightly coupled to the surrounding class/method/block, has a specific context (the surrounding class, method, and block).i use anonymous objects  for calling new Threads..Anonymous inner class can be beneficial while giving different implementations for different objects. But should be used very sparingly as it creates problem for program readability.An inner class is associated with an instance of the outer class and there are two special kinds: Local class and Anonymous class. An anonymous class enables us to declare and instantiate a class at same time, hence makes the code concise. We use them when we need a local class only once as they don\'t have a name.Consider the example from doc where we have a Person class:and we have a method to print members that match search criteria as:where CheckPerson is an interface like:Now we can make use of anonymous class which implements this interface to specify search criteria as:Here the interface is very simple and the syntax of anonymous class seems unwieldy and unclear.Java 8 has introduced a term Functional Interface which is an interface with only one abstract method, hence we can say CheckPerson is a functional interface.  We can make use of Lambda Expression which allows us to pass the function as method argument as:We can use a standard functional interface Predicate in place of the interface CheckPerson, which will further reduce the amount of code required.One of the major usage of anonymous classes in class-finalization which called finalizer guardian. In Java world using the finalize methods should be avoided until you really need them. You have to remember, when you override the finalize method for sub-classes, you should always invoke super.finalize() as well, because the finalize method of super class won\'t invoke automatically and you can have trouble with memory leaks.so considering the fact mentioned above, you can just use the anonymous classes like:Using this technique you relieved yourself and your other developers to call super.finalize() on each sub-class of the HeavyClass which needs finalize method.You can use anonymous class this waySeems nobody mentioned here but you can also use anonymous class to hold generic type argument (which normally lost due to type erasure):If you\'ll instantiate this class in anonymous way then such holder instance will contain non-erasured definition of passed type. This is very handy for building validators/deserializators. Also you can instantiate generic type with reflection (so if you ever wanted to do new T() in parametrized type - you are welcome!).The best way to optimize code. also, We can use for an overriding method of a class or interface.
