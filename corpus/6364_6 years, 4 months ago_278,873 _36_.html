Is it possible to get the IP address of the device using some code?This is my helper util to read IP and MAC addresses. Implementation is pure-java, but I have a comment block in getMACAddress() which could read value from the special linux(android) file. I\'ve run this code only on few devices and Emulator but let me know here if you find weird results.Utils.javaDisclaimer: ideas and example code to this utils class came from\n  several SO posts and google. I have cleaned and merged all examples.This worked for me:I used following code:\nThe reason I used hashCode was because I was getting some garbage values appended to the ip address when I used getHostAddress . But hashCode worked really well for me as then I can use Formatter to get the ip address with correct formatting.Here is the example output :1.using getHostAddress : ***** IP=fe80::65ca:a13d:ea5a:233d%rmnet_sdio02.using hashCode and Formatter :  ***** IP=238.194.77.212As you can see 2nd methods gives me exactly what I need.Though there\'s a correct answer, I share my answer here and hope that this way will more convenience. Below code might help you.. Don\'t forget to add permissions.. Add below permission in the manifest file.happy coding!!I\'ve added inetAddress instanceof Inet4Address to check if it is a ipv4 address.You do not need to add permissions like what is the case with the solutions provided so far. Download this website as a string: http://www.ip-api.com/jsonor http://www.telize.com/geoipDownloading a website as a string can be done with java code:http://www.itcuties.com/java/read-url-to-string/Parse the JSON object like this:https://stackoverflow.com/a/18998203/1987258The json attribute "query" or "ip" contains the IP address. If you have a shell ; ifconfig eth0 worked for x86 device tooRecently, an IP address is still returned by getLocalIpAddress() despite being disconnected from the network (no service indicator). It means the IP address displayed in the Settings> About phone> Status was different from what the application thought.I have implemented a workaround by adding this code before:Does that ring a bell to anyone?Please check this code...Using this code. we will get ip from mobile internet...I don\'t do Android, but I\'d tackle this in a totally different way.Send a query to Google, something like:\nhttps://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=my%20ipAnd refer to the HTML field where the response is posted. You may also query directly to the source.Google will most like be there for longer than your Application.Just remember, it could be that your user does not have internet at this time, what would you like to happen !Good LuckBased on what I have tested this is my proposal
