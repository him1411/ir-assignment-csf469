What mime type should WOFF fonts be served as?I am serving truetype (ttf) fonts as font/truetype and opentype (otf) as font/opentype, but I cannot find the correct format for WOFF fonts.I have tried font/woff, font/webopen, and font/webopentype, but Chrome still complains:"Resource interpreted as font but transferred with MIME type application/octet-stream."Anybody know?In January 2011 it was announced that in the meantime Chromium will recognizeapplication/x-font-woffas the mime-type for WOFF. I know this change is now in Chrome beta and if not in stable yet, it shouldn\'t be too far away.Update from Steve Workman\'s comment Dec 13 2012Spec is now a recommendation and is officially application/font-woffFor me, the next has beeen working in an .htaccess file.It will be application/font-woff.see http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/#appendix-b (W3C Candidate Recommendation 04 August 2011)and http://www.w3.org/2002/06/registering-mediatype.htmlFrom Mozilla css font-face notesIn Gecko, web fonts are subject to the same domain restriction (font files must be on the same domain as the page using them), unless HTTP access controls are used to relax this restriction.\n  Note: Because there are no defined MIME types for TrueType, OpenType, and WOFF fonts, the MIME type of the file specified is not considered.source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/@font-face#NotesNGINX SOLUTIONfileoraddremoveREFERENCESThanks to Mike Fulcherhttp://drawingablank.me/blog/font-mime-types-in-nginx.htmlReference for adding font mime types to .NET/IISvia web.configvia IIS ManagerThere is no font MIME type! Thus, font/xxx is ALWAYS wrong.@Nico,Currently there is no defined standard for the woff font mime type.  I use a font delivery cdn service and it uses font/woff and I get the same warning in chrome.Reference: The Internet Assigned Numbers AuthorityThing that did it for me was to add this to my mime_types.rb initializer:and wipe out the cachebefore restarting the server.Source: https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/issues/366#issuecomment-9085509WOFF:Try to add that:Maybe this will help someone. I saw that on IIS 7 .ttf is already a known mime-type. It\'s configured as:So I just added that for all the CSS font types (.oet, .svg, .ttf, .woff) and IIS started serving them. Chrome dev tools also do not complain about re-interpreting the type.Cheers,\nMichaelAdd the following to your .htaccessgood luckAs of February 2017, RFC8081 is the proposed standard. It defines a top-level media type for fonts, therefore the standard media type for WOFF and WOFF2 are as follows:IIS automatically defined .ttf as application/octet-stream which seems to work fine and fontshop recommends .woff to be defined as application/octet-streamI have had the same problem just a moment ago and this is the solution that worked for me:I have had the same problem, font/opentype worked for meMime type might not be your only problem. If the font file is hosted on S3 or other domain, you may additionally have the issue that Firefox will not load fonts from different domains. It\'s an easy fix with Apache, but in Nginx, I\'ve read that you may need to encode your font files in base-64 and embed them directly in your font css file.For all Solution index.php remove form url and woff file allowed. for write below code in .htaccess file and and make this alternation to your application/config/config.php file:\n$config[\'index_page\'] = \'\';For only Linux hosting server.\n.htaccess file details
