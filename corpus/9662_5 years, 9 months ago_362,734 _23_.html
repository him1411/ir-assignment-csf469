I tried both but new line is not reflecting while rendering the html file.\nHow can I do that?Try this one:&#10; Line Feed and &#13; Carriage Return are HTML entitieswikipedia. This way you are actually parsing the new line ("\\n") rather than displaying it as text.Fiddle showing that it works: http://jsfiddle.net/trott/5vu28/.If you really want this to be on a single line in the source file, you could insert the HTML character references for a line feed and a carriage return as shown in the answer from @Bakudan:I\'ve found String.fromCharCode(13, 10) helpful when using view engines. \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCodeThis creates a string with the actual newline characters in it and so forces the view engine to output a newline rather than an escaped version. Eg: Using NodeJS EJS view engine - This is a simple example in which any \\n should be replaced:viewHelper.jsEJSRendersreplaceAll:To get a new line inside textarea, put an actual linebreak there:try this.. it works:replacing for  tags:You might want to use \\n instead of /n.I think you are confusing the syntax of different languages.&#10; is (the HtmlEncoded value of ASCII 10 or) the linefeed character literal in a HTML string. It does NOT render as a line break in HTML (see notes at bottom).\\n is the linefeed character literal (ASCII 10) in a Javascript string.<br/> is a line break in HTML. Many other elements, eg <p>, <div>, etc also render line breaks unless overridden with some styles.Hopefully the following illustration will make it clearer:A few points to note about Html:After lots of tests, following code works for me in Typescreipt
