Are there any methods in JavaScript that could be used to encode and decode a string using base64 encoding?Some browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera and IE10+ can handle Base64 natively. Take a look at this Stackoverflow question. It\'s using btoa() and atob() functions.For server-side JavaScript, there\'s a btoa package for Node.JS.If you are going for a cross-browser solution, there are existing libraries like CryptoJS or code like:http://ntt.cc/2008/01/19/base64-encoder-decoder-with-javascript.htmlWith the latter, you need to thoroughly test the function for cross browser compatibility. And error has already been reported.In Gecko/WebKit-based browsers (Firefox, Chrome and Safari) and Opera, you can use btoa() and atob().Original answer: How can you encode a string to Base64 in JavaScript?Here is a tightened up version of Sniper\'s post. It presumes well formed base64 string with no carriage returns. This version eliminates a couple of loops, adds the &0xff fix from Yaroslav, eliminates trailing nulls, plus a bit of code golf.Re-written and modularized UTF-8 and Base64 Javascript Encoding and Decoding Libraries / Modules for AMD, CommonJS, Nodejs and Browsers. Cross-browser compatible.Here is how you encode normal text to base64 in Node.js:And here is how you decode base64 encoded strings:To encode an array of bytes using dojox.encoding.base64:To decode a base64-encoded string:If you would like to learn more about how base64 is encoded in general, and in JavaScript in-particular, I would recommend this article:  Computer science in JavaScript: Base64 encodingShort and fast Base64 JavaScript Decode Function without Failsafe:The php.js project has JavaScript implementations of many of PHP\'s functions. base64_encode and base64_decode are included.Here is best way to base64_encode and base64_decode using javascript. See below links.http://phpjs.org/functions/base64_encode:358http://phpjs.org/functions/base64_decode:357I have tried the Javascript routines at phpjs.org and they have worked well.I first tried the routines suggested in the chosen answer by Ranhiru Cooray -  http://ntt.cc/2008/01/19/base64-encoder-decoder-with-javascript.htmlI found that they did not work in all circumstances.   I wrote up a test case where these routines fail and posted them to GitHub at:https://github.com/scottcarter/base64_javascript_test_data.gitI also posted a comment to the blog post at ntt.cc to alert the author (awaiting moderation - the article is old so not sure if comment will get posted).Did someone say code golf? =)The following is my attempt at improving my handicap while catching up with the times. Supplied for your convenience.What I was actually after was an asynchronous implementation and to my surprise it turns out forEach as opposed to JQuery\'s $([]).each method implementation is very much synchronous.If you also had such crazy notions in mind a 0 delay window.setTimeout will run the base64 decode asynchronously and execute the callback function with the result when done.forEach is ECMA-262 standard 5th edition and should you care about retarded browsers you may wish to poly-fill the functionality to nudge them along or alternatively you could also emplore something like the ECMAScript 6 Harmony project which will accomplish the full ES5 to ES6 transition for you.If however you were looking for something a little more traditional perhaps the following is more to your taste.I didn\'t have the trailing null issue so this was removed to remain under par but it should easily be resolved with a trim() or a trimRight() if you\'d prefer, should this pose a problem for you.ie.nJoy!I\'d rather use the bas64 encode/decode methods from CryptoJS, the most popular library for standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns.
