I have the value 25.00 in a float, but when I print it on screen it is 25.0000000.\nHow can I display the value with only two decimal places?It is not a matter of how the number is stored, it is a matter of how you are displaying it. When converting it to a string you must round to the desired precision, which in your case is two decimal places.E.g.:%.02f tells the formatter that you will be formatting a float (%f) and, that should be rounded to two places, and should be padded with 0s.E.g.:Here are few corrections-and so on...You can also try using NSNumberFormatter:You may need to also set the negative format, but I think it\'s smart enough to figure it out.In Swift Language, if you want to show you need to use it in this way. To assign double value in UITextView, for example:If you want to show in LOG like as objective-c does using NSLog(), then in Swift Language you can do this way:I made a swift extension based on above answersusage:IN objective-c, if you are dealing with regular char arrays (instead of pointers to NSString) you could also use:OTOH, if what you want is to store that value on a char array you could use:in objective -c is u want to display float value in 2 decimal number then pass argument indicating how many decimal points u want to display\ne.g 0.02f will print 25.00\n    0.002f will print 25.000Here\'s some methods to format dynamically according to a precision:e.g. => 2.3453=> 2=> 2.35 (round up)Another method for Swift (without using NSString):P.S. this solution is not working with CGFloat type only tested with Float & DoubleIf you need to float value as well:Use NSNumberFormatter with maximumFractionDigits as below:And you will get 12.35The problem with all the answers is that multiplying and then dividing results in precision issues because you used division.  I learned this long ago from programming on a PDP8.\nThe way to resolve this is:Thus 15.6578 returns just 15.66 and not 15.6578999 or something unintended like that.What level of precision you want is up to you.  Just don\'t divide the product, multiply it by the decimal equivalent.\nNo funny String conversion required.
