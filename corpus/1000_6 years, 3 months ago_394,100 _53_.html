I am trying to create an ImageView in a Fragment which will refer to the ImageView element which I have created in the XML for the Fragment. However, the findViewById method only works if I extend an Activity class. Is there anyway of which I can use it in Fragment as well?The findViewById method has an error on it which states that the method is undefined.Use getView() or the View parameter from implementing the  onViewCreated method. It returns the root view for the fragment (the one returned by onCreateView() method). With this you can call findViewById().As getView() works only after onCreateView(), you can\'t use it inside onCreate() or onCreateView() methods of the fragment .You need to inflate the Fragment\'s view and call findViewById() on the View it returns.Inside Fragment class you will get onViewCreated() override method where you should always initialize your views as in this method you get view object using which you can find your views like :Always remember in case of Fragment that onViewCreated() method will not called automatically if you are returning null or super.onCreateView() from onCreateView() method.\nIt will be called by default in case of ListFragment as ListFragment return FrameLayout by default.Note: you can get the fragment view anywhere in the class by using getView() once onCreateView() has been executed successfully.\n i.e.I realise this is an old question, but the prevailing answer leaves something to be desired.The question is not clear what is required of imageView - are we passing it back as the view, or merely saving a reference for later?Either way, if the ImageView is coming from the inflated layout, the correct way to do this would be:Get first the fragment view and then get from this view your ImageView.getView() will give the root viewYou can override onViewCreated() which is called right after all views had been inflated. It\'s the right place to fill in your Fragment\'s member View variables. Here\'s an example:You could also do it in the onActivityCreated Method. Like they do here: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.htmlandare possible.The method getView() wont work on fragments outside OnCreate and similar methods.You have two ways, pass the view to the function on the oncreate (what means you can only run your functions when the view is being created) or set the view as a variable:agreed with calling findViewById() on the View.According to the documentation on API level 11Reference, in Back Stack\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.htmlshort codeUsing getView() returns the view of the fragment, then you can call findViewById() to access any view element in the fragment view.Use it will work1) Declare your layout file.    2)Then, get the id of your view The best way to implement this is as follows:    In this way, the rootView can be used for each control defined in the xml layout and the code is much cleaner in this way.Hope this helps :)Try this it works for me Use gradle skeleton plugin, it will automatically generate the view holder classes with the reference to your layout.Now assuming you had an ImageView declared in your my_layout.xml file, it will automatically generate myLayout class for you.There is one more method called onViewCreated.Try This:tryYou can call findViewById() with the Activity Object you get inside your public void onAttach(Activity activity) method inside your Fragment.Save the Activity into a variable for example:In the Fragment class:\nprivate Activity mainActivity;\nIn the onAttach() method:\nthis.mainActivity=activity;Finally execute every findViewById through the vairable:\nmainActivity.findViewById(R.id.TextView);Inside onCreateView method1) first you have to inflate the layout/view you want to add\neg. LinearLayout2) Then you can find your imageView id from layout3)return the inflated layoutYou have to inflate the viewLayout inflater comes into picture here. Layout inflater is a class that make us able to use the XML views in java code. So you can inflate the root xml view in variable v with the following code. And then using v, you can find the child views of the root view v.The easiest way to use such things is to use butterknife\nBy this you can add as many Onclciklisteners just by @OnClick() as described below:Notice if you use getView() method it might cause nullPointerException because it returns the rootview and it will be some view after onCreateView() method.In fragments we need a view of that window so that we make a onCreateView of this Fragment. Then get the view and use it to access each and every view id of that view elements..I got the same issue (View in a  Fragment could not be reached). The reason turned out to be, that - immediately after (FragmentTransaction).commit() -, the  View had not been activated in the UI. There is no guarantee when, after .commit(), the transaction takes place; it\'s only queued. So I added a (FragmentManager).executePendingTransactions() to force the transaction to be done. After that, referencing the View works as expected !
