I have a byte[] array that is loaded from a file that I happen to known contains UTF-8. In some debugging code, I need to convert it to a string. Is there a one liner that will do this? Under the covers it should be just an allocation and a memcopy, so even if it is not implemented, it should be possible.There\'re at least four different ways doing this conversion.Encoding\'s GetString, but you won\'t be able to get the original bytes back if those bytes have non-ASCII characters.BitConverter.ToString The output is a "-" delimited string, but there\'s no .NET built-in method to convert the string back to byte array.Convert.ToBase64String You can easily convert the output string back to byte array by using Convert.FromBase64String. Note: The output string could contain \'+\', \'/\' and \'=\'. If you want to use the string in a URL, you need to explicitly encode it.HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenEncodeYou can easily convert the output string back to byte array by using HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenDecode. The output string is already URL friendly! The downside is it needs System.Web assembly if your project is not a web project.A full example:A general solution to convert from byte array to string when you don\'t know the encoding:    Definition:Using:Converting a byte[] to a string seems simple but any kind of encoding is likely to mess up the output string. This little function just works without any unexpected results: Using (byte)b.ToString("x2"), Outputs b4b5dfe475e58b67There is also class UnicodeEncoding, quite simple in usage:Alternatively:A Linq one-liner for converting a byte array byteArrFilename read from a file to a pure ascii C-style zero-terminated string would be this: Handy for reading things like file index tables in old archive formats.I use \'?\' as default char for anything not pure ascii here, but that can be changed, of course. If you want to be sure you can detect it, just use \'\\0\' instead, since the TakeWhile at the start ensures that a string built this way cannot possibly contain \'\\0\' values from the input source.BitConverter class can be used to convert a byte[] to string.Documentation of BitConverter class can be fount on MSDNTo my knowledge none of the given answers guarantee correct behavior with null termination. Until someone shows me differently I wrote my own static class for handling this with the following methods:The reason for the startIndex was in the example I was working on specifically I needed to parse a byte[] as an array of null terminated strings. It can be safely ignored in the simple case
