In C, what is the difference between using ++i and i++, and which should be used in the incrementation block of a for loop?++i will increment the value of i, and then return the incremented value.i++ will increment the value of i, but return the original value that i held before being incremented.For a for loop, either works. ++i seems more common, perhaps because that is what is used in K&R.In any case, follow the guideline "prefer ++i over i++" and you won\'t go wrong.There\'s a couple of comments regarding the efficiency of ++i and i++. In any non-student-project compiler, there will be no performance difference.  You can verify this by looking at the generated code, which will be identical.The efficiency question is interesting... here\'s my attempt at an answer:\nIs there a performance difference between i++ and ++i in C?As On Freund notes, it\'s different for a C++ object, since operator++() is a function and the compiler can\'t know to optimize away the creation of a temporary object to hold the intermediate value.i++ is known as Post Increment whereas ++i is called Pre Increment.i++i++ is post increment because it increments i\'s value by 1 after the operation is over.Lets see the following example:Here value of j = 1 but i = 2. Here value of i will be assigned to j first then i will be incremented.++i ++i is pre increment because it increments i\'s value by 1 before the operation.\nIt means j = i; will execute after i++. Lets see the following example:Here value of j = 2 but i = 2. Here value of i will be assigned to j after the i  incremention of i.\nSimilarly ++i will be executed before j=i;.For your question  which should be used in the incrementation block of a for loop? the answer is, you can use any one.. no matter. It will execute your for loop same no. of times.AndBoth the loops will produce same output. ie 0 1 2 3 4.It only matters where you are using it.In this case output will be 1 2 3 4 5.Please don\'t worry about the "efficiency" (speed, really) of which one is faster.  We have compilers these days that take care of these things.  Use whichever one makes sense to use, based on which more clearly shows your intent.++i increments the value, then returns it.i++ returns the value, and then increments it.It\'s a subtle difference.For a for loop, use ++i, as it\'s slightly faster. i++ will create an extra copy that just gets thrown away.The reason ++i can be slightly faster than i++ is that i++ can require a local copy of the value of i before it gets incremented, while ++i never does. In some cases, some compilers will optimize it away if possible... but it\'s not always possible, and not all compilers do this.I try not to rely too much on compilers optimizations, so I\'d follow Ryan Fox\'s advice: when I can use both, I use ++i. i++ :- In this scenario first the value is assigned and then increment happens. ++i :- In this scenario first the increment is done and then value is assignedBelow is the image visualization and also here is a nice practical video ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrtcfgbUXm4) which demonstrates the same.The effective result of using either is identical.  In other words, the loop will do the same exact thing in both instances.In terms of efficiency, there could be a penalty involved with choosing i++ over ++i.  In terms of the language spec, using the post-increment operator should create an extra copy of the value on which the operator is acting.  This could be a source of extra operations.However, you should consider two main problems with the preceding logic.Modern compilers are great.  All good compilers are smart enough to realize that it is seeing an integer increment in a for-loop, and it will optimize both methods to the same efficient code.  If using post-increment over pre-increment actually causes your program to have a slower running time, then you are using a terrible compiler.In terms of operational time-complexity, the two methods (even if a copy is actually being performed) are equivalent.  The number of instructions being performed inside of the loop should dominate the number of operations in the increment operation significantly.  Therefore, in any loop of significant size, the penalty of the increment method will be massively overshadowed by the execution of the loop body.  In other words, you are much better off worrying about optimizing the code in the loop rather than the increment.In my opinion, the whole issue simply boils down to a style preference.  If you think pre-increment is more readable, then use it.  Personally, I prefer the post-incrment, but that is probably because it was what I was taught before I knew anything about optimization.This is a quintessential example of premature optimization, and issues like this have the potential to distract us from serious issues in design.  It is still a good question to ask, however, because there is no uniformity in usage or consensus in "best practice."++i (Prefix operation): Increments and then assigns the value\n(eg) : int i = 5 , int b = ++i\n       In this case, 6 is assigned to b first and then increments to 7 and so on.i++ (Postfix operation): Assigns and then increments the value\n(eg) : int i = 5 , int b = i++\n       In this case, 5 is assigned to b first and then increments to 6 and so on.Incase of for loop : i++ is mostly used because, normally we use the starting value of i before incrementing in for loop.But depending on your program logic it may vary.I assume you understand the difference in semantics now (though honestly I wonder why\npeople ask \'what does operator X mean\' questions on stack overflow rather than reading,\nyou know, a book or web tutorial or something.But anyway, as far as which one to use, ignore questions of performance, which are\nunlikely important even in C++.  This is the principle you should use when deciding\nwhich to use:Say what you mean in code.If you don\'t need the value-before-increment in your statement, don\'t use that form of the operator.  It\'s a minor issue, but unless you are working with a style guide that bans one\nversion in favor of the other altogether (aka a bone-headed style guide), you should use\nthe form that most exactly expresses what you are trying to do.QED, use the pre-increment version:++i is pre-increment the other is post-incrementi++: gets the element and then increments it.\n++i: increments i and then returns the elementExample:Output:The difference can be understood by this simple C++ code below:Shortly :\n++i and i++ works same if you are not writing them in a function.\nIf you use something like function(i++) or function(++i) you can see the difference.function(++i) says first increment i by 1, after that put this i into the function with new value.function(i++) says put first i into the function after that increment i by 1.The Main Difference is ++i Pre  (Before Increment)a=i++ means i value will be stored in a without incrementing\na=++i means i value will be stored with incrementing...Here is the example to understand the differenceoutput: 10 12/11 11 (depending on the order of evaluation of arguments to the printf function, which varies across compilers and architectures)Explanation:\ni++->i is printed, and then increments. (Prints 10, but i will become 11)\n++i->i value increments and prints the value. (Prints 12, and the value of i also 12)
