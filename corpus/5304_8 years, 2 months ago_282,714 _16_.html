I\'m trying to export a PostgreSQL table with headings to a CSV file via commandline, however I get it to export to CSV file but without headings. I need those headings as well. My code looks as followsas described in the manual.From psql command line :\\copy my_table to \'filename\' csv headerno semi-colon at the end.instead of just table name, you can also write a query for getting only selected column data.with admin privilege This works When I don\'t have permission to write a file out from Postgres I find that I can run the query from the command line.For version 9.5 I use, it would be like this:Heres how I got it working power shell using pgsl connnect to a Heroku PG database:I had to first change the client encoding to utf8 like this: \\encoding UTF8Then dumped the data to a CSV file this:I used ~ as the delimiter because I don\'t like CSV files, I usually use TSV files, but it won\'t let me add \'\\t\' as the delimiter, so I used ~ because its a rarely used characeter. copy (anysql query datawanttoexport) to \'fileablsoutepathwihname\' delimiter \',\' csv header;Using this u can export data also.
