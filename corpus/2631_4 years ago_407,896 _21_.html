I would like my Bash script to print an error message if the required argument count is not met.I tried the following code:For some unknown reason I\'ve got the following error:What am I doing wrong?Just like any other simple command, [ ... ] or test requires spaces between its arguments.OrWhen in Bash, prefer using [[ ]] instead as it doesn\'t do word splitting and pathname expansion to its variables that quoting may not be necessary unless it\'s part of an expression.It also has some other features like unquoted condition grouping, pattern matching (extended pattern matching with extglob) and regex matching.The following example checks if arguments are valid. It allows a single argument or two.For pure arithmetic expressions, using (( )) to some may still be better, but they are still possible in [[ ]] with its arithmetic operators like -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge by placing the expression as a single string argument:That should be helpful if you would need to combine it with other features of [[ ]] as well.It might be a good idea to use arithmetic expressions if you\'re dealing with numbers.On []: !=, =, == ... are string comparison operators and -eq, -gt ... are arithmetic binary ones.I would use:Or:If you\'re only interested in bailing if a particular argument is missing, Parameter Substitution is great:A simple one liner that works can be done using:This breaks down to:Thinks to note:You should add spaces between test condition:I hope this helps.
