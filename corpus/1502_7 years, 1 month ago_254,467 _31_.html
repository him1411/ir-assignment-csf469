I\'m not an expert in PHP programming, but I\'m a little confused why I see some code in PHP with string placed in single quotes and sometimes in double quotes.I just know in .NET, or C language, if it is in single quote, that means it is a character, not a string.PHP strings can be specified not just in two ways, but in four ways.Speed:\nI would not put too much weight on single quotes being faster than double quotes. They probably are faster in certain situations. Here\'s an article explaining one manner in which single and double quotes are essentially equally fast since PHP 4.3 (Useless Optimizations toward the bottom, section C). Also, this benchmarks page has a single vs double quote comparison. Most of the comparisons are the same. There is one comparison where double quotes are slower than single quotes.Things get evaluated in double quotes but not in single:The simplest way to specify a string is to enclose it in single quotes. Single quote is generally faster, and everything quoted inside treated as plain string.Example:Use double quotes in PHP to avoid having to use the period to separate code (Note: Use curly braces {} to include variables if you do not want to use concatenation (.) operator) in string.Example:Yes. It is slightly faster to use single quotes.PHP won\'t use additional processing to interpret what is inside the single quote. when you use double quotes PHP has to parse to check if there is any variables in there.A single-quoted string does not have variables within it interpreted.  A double-quoted string does.Also, a double-quoted string can contain apostrophes without backslashes, while a single-quoted string can contain unescaped quotation marks.The single-quoted strings are faster at runtime because they do not need to be parsed.In PHP, both \'my name\' and "my name" are string. You can read more about it at the PHP manual.Thing you should know areIn PHP, people use single quote to define a constant string, like \'a\', \'my name\', \'abc xyz\', while using double quote to define a string contain identifier like "a $b $c $d".And other thing is, is faster thanbutis slower thanThis is true for other used of string.Both kinds of enclosed characters are strings.  One type of quote is conveniently used to enclose the other type of quote.  "\'"  and \'"\'.   The biggest difference between the types of quotes is that enclosed identifier references are substituted for inside double quotes, but not inside single quotes.In PHP, single quote text is considered as string value and double quote text will parse the variables by replacing and processing their value.Here, double quote parse the value and single quote is considered as string value (without parsing $test variable.)One thing: It is very important to note that the line with the closing identifier of Heredoc must contain no other characters, except a semicolon (;). That means especially that the identifier may not be indented, and there may not be any spaces or tabs before or after the semicolon.Example:If we use double quotes in echo statement, it will check both the variable data and string.If we use single quotes in echo statement,  it will consider all data as string only.for more info refer http://phptutorial.co.in/php-echo-print/
