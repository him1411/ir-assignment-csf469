How can I have a div go from collapsed to expanded (and vice versa), but do so from right to left?Most everything I see out there is always left to right.Reference: https://api.jquery.com/animate/This can be achieved natively using the jQueryUI hide/show methods.\nEg.Reference: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/SlideUse this:Live demoImproved versionSome code has been added to the demo, to prevent double margin on double click: http://jsfiddle.net/XNnHC/942/Use it with easing ;)http://jsfiddle.net/XNnHC/1591/Extra JavaScript codes removed. Class names & some CSS codes changedAdded feature to find if is expanded or collapsedChanged whether use easing effect or notChanged animation speedhttp://jsfiddle.net/XNnHC/1808/Take a look at this working example on Fiddle, which uses jQuery UI.\nIt is a solution I\'ve used originally from left to right, but I\'ve changed it to work from right to left.It allows user to click on links quickly without breaking the animation among the available panels.The JavaScript code is simple:Get HTML and CSS at the Fiddle link.Added white background and left-padding just for better effect presentation.Too simple:I\'ve done it this way:Note, that node "btn" should be hidden before animation, and you might also need to set "position: absolute" to it.You can define first the width of the element as 0, floating right, and then on the event that you are about to show it.. it would be likeSimple as that.GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)  with TweenLite / TweenMax provides much smoother transitions with far greater customization than jQuery or CSS3 transitions. In order to animate CSS properties with TweenLite / TweenMax, you\'ll also need their plugin called "CSSPlugin". TweenMax includes this automatically.First, load the TweenMax library:Or the lightweight version, TweenLite:Then, call your animation:You can also call it with an ID selector:If you have jQuery loaded, you can use more advanced broad selectors, like all elements containing a specific class:For full details, see:\nTweenLite DocumentationAccording to their website:\n"TweenLite is an extremely fast, lightweight, and flexible animation tool that serves as the foundation of the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)."An example of right to left animation without jQuery UI, just with jQuery (any version, see https://api.jquery.com/animate/).Check the example here.https://jsfiddle.net/q1pdgn96/2/Another worth mentioning library is animate.css. It works great with jQuery, and you can do a lot of interesting animations simply by toggling CSS classs.Like..$("#slide").toggle().toggleClass(\'animated bounceInLeft\');
