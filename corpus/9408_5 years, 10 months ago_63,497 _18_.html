What\'s a simple way to find the size of my git repository? And I don\'t mean du -h on the root directory of my repo.  I have a lot of ignored files so that size would be different from my total repo size.  I essentially want to know how much data would be transfered upon cloning my repo.UPDATE git 1.8.3 introduced a more efficient way to get a rough size: git count-objects -vH (see answer by @VonC)For different ideas of "complete size" you could use:Close (but not exact:)With the latter, you would also be counting:Note that, since git 1.8.3 (April, 22d 2013):"git count-objects" learned "--human-readable" aka "-H" option to show various large numbers in Ki/Mi/GiB scaled as necessary.That could be combined with the -v option mentioned by Jack Morrison in his answer.(git gc is important, as mentioned by A-B-B\'s answer)Plus (still git 1.8.3), the output is more complete:"git count-objects -v" learned to report leftover temporary packfiles and other garbage in the object store.The git commandwill give you a good estimate of the git repository\'s size. Without the -v flag, it only tells you the size of your unpacked files. This command may not be in your $PATH, you may have to track it down (on Ubuntu I found it in /usr/lib/git-core/, for instance).From the Git man-page:-v, --verboseIn addition to the number of loose objects and disk space consumed,\n             it reports the number of in-pack objects, number of packs, disk\n             space consumed by those packs, and number of objects that can be\n             removed by running git prune-packed.Your output will look similar to the following:The line you\'re looking for is size-pack. That is the size of all the packed commit objects, or the smallest possible size for the new cloned repository.
