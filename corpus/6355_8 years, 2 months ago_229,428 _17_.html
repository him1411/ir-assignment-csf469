I want to rotate a single word of text by 90 degrees, with cross-browser (>= IE6, >= Firefox 2, any version of Chrome, Safari, or Opera) support. How can this be done?Updated this answer with recent information (from CSS Tricks). Kudos to Matt and Douglas for pointing out the filter implementation.Old answer:For FF 3.5 or Safari/Webkit 3.1, check out: -moz-transform (and -webkit-transform).  IE has a Matrix filter(v5.5+), but I\'m not certain how to use it.  Opera has no transformation capabilities yet.I am using the following code to write vertical text in a page.\nFirefox 3.5+, webkit, opera 10.5+ and IEAnother solution is to use an SVG text node which is supported by most browsers.Demo: https://jsfiddle.net/bkymb5kr/More on SVG text: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/text-element.htmlI adapted this from http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/css-text-rotation :I\'ve had problems trying to do it in pure CSS - depending on the font it can look a bit rubbish.  As an alternative you can use SVG/VML to do it.  There are libraries that help make it cross browser with ease e.g. Raphael and ExtJS.  In ExtJS4 the code looks like this:This will work in IE6+ and all modern browsers, however, unfortunately I think you need at least FF3.0.If you use Bootstrap 3, you can use one of it\'s mixins:Example:The CSS Writing Modes module introduces orthogonal flows with vertical text.Just use the writing-mode property with the desired value.My solution that would work on Chrome, Firefox, IE9, IE10 (Change the degrees as per your requirement):
