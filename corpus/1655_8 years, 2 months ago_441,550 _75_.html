I feel dumb for having been a web programmer for so long and not knowing the answer to this question, I actually hope it\'s possible and I just didn\'t know about rather than what I think is the answer (which is that it\'s not possible).My question is whether it is possible to make a CSS class that "inherits" from another CSS class (or more than one).For example, say we had:What I\'d like to do is something like this:where the ".composite" class would both display inline and have a red backgroundThere are tools like LESS, which allow you to compose CSS at a higher level of abstraction similar to what you describe.Less calls these "Mixins"Instead ofYou could sayYou can add multiple classes to a single DOM element, e.g.Inheritance is not part of the CSS standard.Yes, but not exactly with that syntax.An element can take multiple classes:And that\'s about as close as you\'re going to get unfortunately. I\'d love to see this feature, along with class-aliases someday.No you can\'t do something likeThis are no "class" names in the OO sense. .something and .else are just selectors nothing more.But you can either specify two classes on an elementor you might look into another form of inheritance Where the paragraphs backgroundcolor and color are inherited from the settings in the enclosing div which is .foo styled. You might have to check the exact W3C specification. inherit is default for most properties anyway but not for all. Keep your common attributes together and assign specific (or override) attributes again.I ran into this same problem and ended up using a JQuery solution to make it seem like a class  can inherit other classes.This will find all elements with the class "composite" and add the classes "something" and "else" to the elements. So something like <div class="composite">...</div> will end up like so: <div class="composite something else">...</div>Don\'t forget:\nIn Css file:Perfect timing: I went from this question to my email, to find an article about Less, a Ruby library that among other things does this:Since super looks just like footer, but with a different font, I\'ll use Less\'s class inclusion technique (they call it a mixin) to tell it to include these declarations too:Unfortunately, CSS does not provide \'inheritance\' in the way that programming languages like C++, C# or Java do. You can\'t declare a CSS class an then extend it with another CSS class.However, you can apply more than a single class to an tag in your markup ... in which case there is a sophisticated set of rules that determine which actual styles will get applied by the browser. CSS will look for all the styles that can be applied based on what your markup, and combine the CSS styles from those multiple rules together.Typically, the styles are merged, but when conflicts arise, the later declared style will generally win (unless the !important attribute is specified on one of the styles, in which case that wins). Also, styles applied directly to an HTML element take precedence over CSS class styles.The best you can do is thisCSSHTMLThe SCSS way for the given example, would be something like:More info, check the sass basicsYou can apply more than one CSS class to an element by something like this class="something else"As others have said, you can add multiple classes to an element.But that\'s not really the point. I get your question about inheritance. The real point is that inheritance in CSS is done not through classes, but through element hierarchies. So to model inherited traits you need to apply them to different levels of elements in the DOM.There\'s also SASS, which you can find at http://sass-lang.com/. There\'s an @extend tag, as well as a mix-in type system. (Ruby)It\'s kind of a competitor to LESS. That\'s not possible in CSS. The only thing supported in CSS is being more specific than another rule:A span with class "myclass" will have both properties.Another way is by specifying two classes:The style of "else" will override (or add) the style of "something"I realize this question is now very old but, here goes nothin!If the intent is to add a single class that implies the properties of multiple classes, as a native solution, I would recommend using JavaScript/jQuery (jQuery is really not necessary but certainly useful)If you have, for instance .umbrellaClass that "inherits" from .baseClass1 and .baseClass2 you could have some JavaScript that fires on ready.Now all elements of .umbrellaClass will have all the properties of both .baseClasss. Note that, like OOP inheritance, .umbrellaClass may or may not have its own properties.The only caveat here is to consider whether there are elements being dynamically created that won\'t exist when this code fires, but there are simple ways around that as well.Sucks css doesn\'t have native inheritance, though.I was looking for that like crazy too and I just figured it out by trying different things :P... Well you can do it like that:It suddenly worked for me :)Actually what you\'re asking for exists - however it\'s done as add-on modules.  Check out this question on Better CSS in .NET for examples.Check out Larsenal\'s answer on using LESS to get an idea of what these add-ons do.CSS doesn\'t really do what you\'re asking. If you want to write rules with that composite idea in mind, you may want to check out compass. It\'s a stylesheet framework which looks similar to the already mentioned Less.It lets you do mixins and all that good business.For those who are not satisfied with the mentioned (excellent) posts, you can use your programming skills to make a variable (PHP or whichever) and have it store the multiple class names.That\'s the best hack I could come up with.Then apply the global variable to the element you desire rather than the class names themselvesIf you want a more powerful text preprocessor than LESS, check out PPWizard:http://dennisbareis.com/ppwizard.htmWarning the website is truly hideous and there\'s a small learning curve, but it\'s perfect for building both CSS and HTML code via macros. I\'ve never understood why more web coders don\'t use it.You can achieve inheritance-like behavior in this way:  See http://jsfiddle.net/qj76455e/1/The biggest advantage of this approach is modularity - you do not create dependences among classes (as you do when you "inherit" a class using a preprocessor). So any change request regarding CSS does not require any big impact analysis.In specific circumstances you can do a "soft" inheritance:This only works if you are adding the .composite class to a child element. It is "soft" inheritance because any values not specified in .composite are not inherited obviously. Keep in mind it would still be less characters to simply write "inline" and "red" instead of "inherit".Here is a list of properties and whether or not they do this automatically:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.htmlWhile direct inheritance isn\'t possible.It is possible to use a class (or id) for a parent tag and then use CSS combinators to alter child tag behaviour from it\'s heirarchy.I wouldn\'t suggest using so many spans like the example, however it\'s just a proof of concept.  There are still many bugs that can arise when trying to apply CSS in this manner.  (For example altering text-decoration types).You can achieve what you want if you preprocess your .css files through php.\n......
