How do you escape the % sign when using printf in C?You can escape it by posting a double \'%\' like this: %%Using your example:Escaping \'%\' sign is only for printf. If you do:It will print: This is a\'s value: %%As others have said, %% will escape the %.Note, however, that you should never do this:Whenever you have to print a string, always, always, always print it usingto prevent an embedded % from causing problems [memory violations, segfault, etc]If there are no formats in the string, you can use puts (or fputs):if there is a format in the string:As noted in the comments, puts appends a \\n to the output and fputs does not.With itself...use a double %%Nitpick:\nYou don\'t really escape the % in the string that specifies the format for the printf() (and scanf()) family of functions.The %, in the printf() (and scanf()) family of functions, starts a conversion specification. One of the rules for conversion specification states that a % as a conversion specifier (immediately following the % that started the conversion specification) causes a \'%\' character to be written with no argument converted.The string really has 2 \'%\' characters inside (as opposed to escaping characters: "a\\bc" is a string with 3 non null characters; "a%%b" is a string with 4 non null characters).Like this:The backslash in C is used to escape characters in strings. Strings would not recognize % as a special character, and therefore no escape would be necessary. Printf is another matter: use %% to print one %.Yup, use printf("hello%%"); and it\'s done.You can simply use % twice, that is "%%"Example:You can use %%:The result is:100%you are using incorrect format specifier you should use %% for printing %.
