I am creating a report in LaTeX which involves a few tables. I\'m stuck on that as my cell data in the table is exceeding the width of the page. Can I somehow wrap the text so that it falls into the next line in the same cell of the table?Is it somehow related to the table\'s width? But as it\'s overshooting the page\'s width, it won\'t make a difference, will it?Use p{width} for your column specifiers instead of l/r/c.With the regular tabular environment, you want to use the p{width} column type, as marcog indicates. But that forces you to give explicit widths.Another solution is the tabularx environment:All X columns get the same width. You can influence this by setting \\hsize in the format declaration:but then all the factors have to sum up to 1, I suppose (I took this from the LaTeX companion). There is also the package tabulary which will adjust column widths to balance row heights. For the details, you can get the documentation for each package with texdoc tabulary (in TeXlive).Another option is to insert a minipage in each cell where text wrapping is desired, e.g.:I like the simplicity of tabulary package:In the example, you arrange the whole width of the table with respect to \\textwidth. E.g 0.4 of it. Then the rest is automatically done by the package.Most of the example is taken from http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables .If you want to wrap your text but maintain alignment then you can wrap that cell in a minipage or varwidth environment (varwidth comes from the varwidth package). Varwidth will be "as wide as it\'s contents but no wider than X". You can create a custom column type which acts like "p{xx}" but shrinks to fit by usingwhich may require the array package. Then when you use something like \\begin{tabular}{llM{2in}} the first two columns we be normal left-aligned and the third column will be normal left aligned but if it gets wider than 2in then the text will be wrapped.
