I have a vertical sliding drawer at the bottom of my app. When the soft keyboard opens, it pushes the tab for the drawer up, so it sits atop the keyboard. I actually want it to remain at the bottom of the screen, becoming hidden when the keyboard is shown. Anyone else run into this issue? Know how to fix it?You can simply switch your activity\'s windowSoftInputMode flag to "adjustPan".\nCheck the official documentation for more info.None of the answers worked for me, but this did the trick:In my case, the reason the buttons got pushed up was because the view above them was a ScrollView, and it got collapsed with the buttons pushed up above the keyboard no matter what value of android:windowSoftInputMode I was setting.I was able to avoid my bottom row of buttons getting pushed up by the soft keyboard by setting android:isScrollContainer="false" on the ScrollView that sits above the buttons.You can try to add this attribute dynamically, by putting the following code in the onCreate method of your activity:This worked for me, rather that:didnt.These answers here didn\'t help me. So I tried this:This worked like a charm,  Now the header of my app doesn\'t disappear. Its smoother.So far the answers didn\'t help me as I have a button and a textInput field (side by side) below the textView which kept getting hidden by the keyboard, but this has solved my issue:For future readers.I wanted specific control over this issue, so this is what I did:From a fragment or activity, hide your other views (that aren\'t needed while the keyboard is up), then restore them to solve this problem:  For xamarin users add this code to Activity attribute of the MainActivity class,or you can add this code Window.SetSoftInputMode(Android.Views.SoftInput.AdjustNothing) to the OnCreate method of MainActivity class.Add following code to the \'activity\' of Manifest file. Just a single line to be added...Add android:windowSoftInputMode="stateHidden|adjustPan" in required activity of your manifest file.I just got solved :) :) This was the best which worked for meTry it!To do this programatically in a fragment you can use following codePlace this in onResume() The activity\'s main window will not resize to make room for the soft keyboard. Rather, the contents of the window will be automatically panned so that the current focus is never obscured by the keyboard and users can always see what they are typing.This might be a better solution for what you desired.This code works.Try to use this:For Scroll View:if after adding android:windowSoftInputMode="stateHidden|adjustPan" in your Android Manifest and still does not work. It may be affected because when the keyboard appears, it will be into a scroll view and if your button/any objects  is not in your scroll view then the objects will follow the keyboard and move its position.   Check out your xml where your button is and make sure it is under your scroll View bracket and not out of it.Hope this helps out. :D  This code may help you. Use it in your oncreate method. Include in your manifest file under activity which you want to display .But make sure not using Full screen Activity android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan"Well i have watched these answers but in my case i fell into the same issue and got refuge through a very handy and easiest solution that involves putting a very small innocent attribute in your Scrollview tag residing in your xml file. That isGood luck!In my case I needed the keyboard to stay hidden and just after the click of the button my layout needs to be adjusted, so I just added this command in the manifest and it got super right.
