I have an app that sometimes needs its navigation bar to blend in with the content. Does anyone know how to get rid of or to change color of this annoying little bar? On the image below situation i have - i\'m talking about this 1px height line below "Root View Controller"To do this, you should set a custom shadow image. But for the shadow image to be shown you also need to set a custom background image, quote from Apple\'s documentation:For a custom shadow image to be shown, a custom background image must\n  also be set with the setBackgroundImage(_:for:) method. If the default\n  background image is used, then the default shadow image will be used\n  regardless of the value of this property.So:Above is the only "official" way to hide it. Unfortunately, it removes bar\'s translucency.You have those options:Solid color, no translucency:Create small background image filled with color and use it.Use \'hacky\' method described below. It will also keep bar translucent.To keep translucency you need another approach, it looks like a hack but works well. The shadow we\'re trying to remove is a hairline UIImageView somewhere under UINavigationBar. We can find it and hide/show it when needed.Instructions below assume you need hairline hidden only in one controller of your UINavigationController hierarchy.Declare instance variable:Add method which finds this shadow (hairline) UIImageView:Add/edit viewWillAppear/viewWillDisappear methods:The same method should also work for UISearchBar hairline, \nand (almost) anything else you need to hide :)Many thanks to @Leo Natan for the original idea!If you just want to use a solid navigation bar color and have set this up in your storyboard, use this code in your AppDelegate class to remove the 1 pixel border via the appearance proxy:Try this:Below image has the explanation (iOS7 NavigationBar):And check this SO question:\niOS7 - Change UINavigationBar border colorWanted to add the Swift version of Serhii\'s answer.

You should add a view to a bottom of the UISearchBar Did it for me [UIColor blackColor] might be your background color,\nand tabviewController is your UITabBarController if you are using it!This might sound stupid, but this hairline only appears when the background color for viewController\'s view is set to any color, but white. I was shocked to learn this fact.So if you want it to disappear without much trouble just set the controller\'s view background color to WHITE COLOR.My approach:Here\'s another option - I think this only works if you don\'t require translucency on your nav bar (I didn\'t).  I just added a 1 pixel high UIView to the bottom of the nav bar (1 pixel below the nav bar) with the same colour as my nav bar:I\'m adding the constraints using Masonry.Bar style black did it for me.All properties that I have (just in case):Within AppDelegate, this has globally changed the format of the NavBar:Haven\'t managed to implement anything different on a specific VC, but this will help 90% of peopleWhat worked for me, and was simplest, was to create a png (it only needs to be one pixel by one pixel in dimensions) with the required color and then set the backgroundImage and shadowImage to that:
