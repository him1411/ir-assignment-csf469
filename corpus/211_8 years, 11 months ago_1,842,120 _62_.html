For a list ["foo", "bar", "baz"] and an item in the list "bar", what\'s the cleanest way to get its index (1) in Python?Reference: Data Structures > More on ListsOne thing that is really helpful in learning Python is to use the interactive help function:which will often lead you to the method you are looking for.I\'m honestly surprised no one has mentioned enumerate() yet:This can be more useful than index if there are duplicates in the list, because index() only returns the first occurrence, while enumerate returns all occurrences.As a list comprehension:Here\'s also another small solution with itertools.count() (which is pretty much the same approach as enumerate):This is more efficient for larger lists than using enumerate():index() returns the first index of value!|  index(...)\n   |      L.index(value, [start, [stop]]) -> integer -- return first index of valueTo get all indices:A problem will arise if the element is not in the list. This function handles the issue:You have to set a condition to check if the element you\'re searching is in the listAll of the proposed functions here reproduce inherent language behavior but obscure what\'s going on.Why write a function with exception handling if the language provides the methods to do what you want itself?If you want all indexes, then you can use numpy:It is clear, readable solution.Simply you can go withall indexes with zip functionAnother optionA variant on the answer from FMc and user7177 will give a dict that can return all indices for any entry:You could also use this as a one liner to get all indices for a single entry. There are no guarantees for efficiency, though I did use set(a) to reduce the number of times the lambda is called.This solution is not as powerful as others, but if you\'re a beginner and only know about forloops it\'s still possible to find the first index of an item while avoiding the ValueError:... like confirming the existence of the item before getting the index.  The nice thing about this approach is the function always returns a list of indices -- even if it is an empty list.  It works with strings as well.When pasted into an interactive python window:For a list ["foo", "bar", "baz"] and an item in the list "bar", what\'s the cleanest way to get its index (1) in Python?Well, sure, there\'s the index method, which returns the index of the first occurrence:There are a couple of issues with this method:If the value could be missing, you need to catch the ValueError. You can do so with a reusable definition like this:And use it like this:And the downside of this is that you will probably have a check for if the returned value is or is not None:If you could have more occurrences, you\'ll not get complete information with list.index:You might enumerate into a list comprehension the indexes:If you have no occurrences, you can check for that with boolean check of the result, or just do nothing if you loop over the results:If you have pandas, you can easily get this information with a Series object:A comparison check will return a series of booleans:Pass that series of booleans to the series via subscript notation, and you get just the matching members:If you want just the indexes, the index attribute returns a series of integers:And if you want them in a list or tuple, just pass them to the constructor:Yes, you could use a list comprehension with enumerate too, but that\'s just not as elegant, in my opinion - you\'re doing tests for equality in Python, instead of letting builtin code written in C handle it:The XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem.Why do you think you need the index given an element in a list? If you already know the value, why do you care where it is in a list?If the value isn\'t there, catching the ValueError is rather verbose - and I prefer to avoid that.I\'m usually iterating over the list anyways, so I\'ll usually keep a pointer to any interesting information, getting the index with enumerate.If you\'re munging data, you should probably be using pandas - which has far more elegant tools than the pure Python workarounds I\'ve shown.I do not recall needing list.index, myself. However, I have looked through the Python standard library, and I see some excellent uses for it. There are many, many uses for it in idlelib, for GUI and text parsing.The keyword module uses it to find comment markers in the module to automatically regenerate the list of keywords in it via metaprogramming.In Lib/mailbox.py it seems to be using it like an ordered mapping:andIn Lib/http/cookiejar.py, seems to be used to get the next month:In Lib/tarfile.py similar to distutils to get a slice up to an item:In Lib/pickletools.py:What these usages seem to have in common is that they seem to operate on lists of constrained sizes (important because of O(n) lookup time for list.index), and they\'re mostly used in parsing (and UI in the case of Idle). While there are use-cases for it, they are fairly uncommon. If you find yourself looking for this answer, ask yourself if what you\'re doing is the most direct usage of the tools provided by the language for your use-case.This accounts for if the string is not in the list too, if it isn\'t in the list then location = -1Since Python lists are zero-based,we can use the zip built-in function as follows :where "haystack" is the list in question and "needle" is the item to look for.(Note : Here we are iterating using i to get the indexes but if we need rather to focus on the items we can switch to j)
