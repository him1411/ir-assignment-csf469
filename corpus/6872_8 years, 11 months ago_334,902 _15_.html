I want to delete a folder that contains thousands of files and folders. If I use Windows Explorer to delete the folder it can take 10-15 minutes (not always, but often). Is there a faster way in Windows to delete folders? Other details:Use Windows Command Prompt: The worst way is to send to Recycle Bin: you still need to delete them. Next worst is shift+delete with Windows Explorer: it wastes loads of time checking the contents before starting deleting anything. Next best is to use rmdir /s/q foldername from the command line. del /f/s/q foldername is good too, but it leaves behind the directory structure.The best I\'ve found is a two line batch file with a first pass to delete files and outputs to nul to avoid the overhead of writing to screen for every singe file. A second pass then cleans up the remaining directory structure:This is nearly three times faster than a single rmdir, based on time tests with a Windows XP encrypted disk, deleting ~30GB/1,000,000 files/15,000 folders: rmdir takes ~2.5 hours, del+rmdir takes ~53 minutes. More info at Super User. This is a regular task for me, so I usually move the stuff I need to delete to C:\\stufftodelete and have those del+rmdir commands in a deletestuff.bat batch file. This is scheduled to run at night, but sometimes I need to run it during the day so the quicker the better.use fastcopy, a free tool.\n it has a delete option that is a lot faster then the way windows deletes files.use the command prompt, as suggested.  I figured out why explorer is so slow a while ago, it gives you an estimate of how long it will take to delete the files/folders.  To do this, it has to scan the number of items and the size.  This takes ages, hence the ridiculous wait with large folders.Also, explorer will stop if there is a particular problem with a file,and to delete a lot of folders, you could also create a batch file with the command spdenne posted. 1) make a text file that has the following contents replacing the folder names in quotes with your folder names:2) save the batch file with a .bat extension (for example deletefiles.bat)\n3) open a command prompt (Start > Run > Cmd) and execute the batch file. you can do this like so from the command prompt (substituting X for your drive letter):Try [shift]+[delete] did 24.000 files in 2 minutes for me
