Do you think there is a big difference in for...in and for loops? What kind of "for" do you prefer to use and why?Let\'s say we have an array of associative arrays:So we can iterate:And:I don\'t see a big difference. Are there any performance issues?The choice should be based on the which idiom is best understood.An array is iterated using:An object being used as an associative array is iterated using:Unless you have earth shattering reasons, stick to the established pattern of usage.Douglas Crockford recommends in JavaScript: The Good Parts (page 24) to avoid using the for in statement. If you use for in to loop over property names in an object, the results are not ordered. Worse: You might get unexpected results; it includes members inherited from the prototype chain and the name of methods.Everything but the properties can be filtered out with .hasOwnProperty. This code sample does what you probably wanted originally:jQuery\'s each(callback) method uses for( ; ; ) loop by default, and will use for( in ) only if the length is undefined. Therefore, I would say it is safe to assume the correct order when using this function.Example:The downside of using this is that if you\'re doing some non UI logic, your functions will be less portable to other frameworks. The each() function is probably best reserved for use with jQuery selectors and for( ; ; ) might be advisable otherwise.there are performance differences depending on what kind of loop you use and on what browser.For instance:is almost twice as fast on some browsers than:However unless your arrays are HUGE or you loop them constantly all are fast enough. I seriously doubt that array looping is a bottleneck in your project (or for any other project for that matter)Note that the native Array.forEach method is now widely supported.Updated answer for 2012 current version of all major browsers - Chrome, Firefox, IE9, Safari and Opera support ES5\'s native array.forEach.Unless you have some reason to support IE8 natively (keeping in mind ES5-shim or Chrome frame can be provided to these users, which will provide a proper JS environment), it\'s cleaner to simply use the language\'s proper syntax:Full documentation for array.forEach() is at MDN.Using forEach to skip the prototype chain Just a quick addendum to @nailer\'s answer above, using forEach with Object.keys means you can avoid iterating over the prototype chain without having to use hasOwnProperty. I second opinions that you should choose the iteration method according to your need. I would suggest you actually not to ever loop through native Array with for in structure. It is way slower and, as Chase Seibert pointed at the moment ago, not compatible with Prototype framework.There is an excellent benchmark on different looping styles that you absolutely should take a look at if you work with JavaScript. Do not do early optimizations, but you should keep that stuff somewhere in the back of your head.I would use for in to get all properties of an object, which is especially useful when debugging your scripts. For example, I like to have this line handy when I explore unfamiliar object:It dumps content of the whole object (together with method bodies) to my Firebug log. Very handy.The two are not the same when the array is sparse.here is something i did.this is how you would use it\nthis will work on arrays and objects( such as a list of HTML elements )I just made this so I\'m open to suggestions :)I\'d use the different methods based on how I wanted to reference the items.Use foreach if you just want the current item.Use for if you need an indexer to do relative comparisons. (I.e. how does this compare to the previous/next item?)I have never noticed a performance difference. I\'d wait until having a performance issue before worrying about it.With for (var i in myArray) you can loop over objects too, i will contain the key name and you can access the property via myArray[i]. Additionaly, any methods you will have added to the object will be included in the loop, too, i.e., if you use any external framework like jQuery or prototype, or if you add methods to object prototypes directly, at one point i will point to those methods.Watch out!If you have several script tags and your\'re searching an information in tag attributes for example, you have to use .length property with a for loop because it isn\'t a simple array but an HTMLCollection object.https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLCollectionIf you use the foreach statement for(var i in yourList) it will return proterties and methods of the HTMLCollection in most browsers!Even if getElementsByTagName should return a NodeList, most browser are returning an HTMLCollection:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.getElementsByTagNameFor in loops on Arrays is not compatible with Prototype. If you think you might need to use that library in the future, it would make sense to stick to for loops.http://www.prototypejs.org/api/arrayI have seen problems with the "for each" using objects and prototype and arraysmy understanding is that the for each is for properties of objects and NOT arraysIf you really want to speed up your code, what about that?it\'s kinda of having the while logic within the for statement and it\'s less redundant. Also firefox has Array.forEach and Array.filterA shorter and best code according to jsperf isUse the Array().forEach loop to take advantage of parallelismBe careful!!!\nI am using Chrome 22.0 in Mac OS and I am having problem with the for each syntax.I do not know if this is a browser issue, javascript issue or some error in the code, but it is VERY strange. Outside of the object it works perfectly.for(;;) is for Arrays : [20,55,33]for..in is for Objects : {x:20,y:55:z:33}There is an important difference between both. The for-in iterates over the properties of an object, so when the case is an array it will not only iterate over its elements but also over the "remove" function it has.You could use the for-in with an if(myArray.hasOwnProperty(i)). Still, when iterating over arrays I always prefer to avoid this and just use the for(;;) statement.
