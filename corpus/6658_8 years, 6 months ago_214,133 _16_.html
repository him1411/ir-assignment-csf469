In Perl I can skip a foreach (or any loop) iteration with a next; command.Is there a way to skip over an iteration and jump to the next loop in C#?You want:Here\'s more about the continue keyword.Update: In response to Brian\'s follow-up question in the comments:Could you further clarify what I would do if I had nested for loops, and wanted to skip the iteration of one of the extended ones?A continue always applies to the nearest enclosing scope, so you couldn\'t use it to break out of the outermost loop. If a condition like that arises, you\'d need to do something more complicated depending on exactly what you want, like break from the inner loop, then continue on the outer loop. See here for the documentation on the break keyword. The break C# keyword is similar to the Perl last keyword.Also, consider taking Dustin\'s suggestion to just filter out values you don\'t want to process beforehand:Another approach is to filter using LINQ before the loop executes:You could also flip your if test:You can use the continue statement.For example:Another approach using linq is:If you want to skip the first in a number of items.Or use .SkipWhere if you want to specify a condition for skipping.Use the continue statement:
