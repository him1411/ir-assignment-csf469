Is it possible to open a jQuery UI Dialog without a title bar?I think that the best solution is to use the option dialogClass.An extract from jquery UI docs:during init  :  $(\'.selector\').dialog({ dialogClass: \'noTitleStuff\' });or if you want after init.  :  So i created some dialog with option dialogClass=\'noTitleStuff\' and the css like that:too simple !! but i took 1 day to think why my previous id->class drilling method was not working. In fact when you call .dialog() method the div you transform become a child of another div (the real dialog div) and possibly a \'brother\' of the titlebar div, so it\'s very difficult to try finding the latter starting from former.I figured out a fix for dynamically removing the title bar.This will remove all elements with the class \'ui-dialog-titlebar\' after the dialog box is rendered.I use this in my projectsI believe you can hide it with CSS: Alternatively, you can apply this to specific dialogs with the dialogClass option:Check out "Theming" the Dialog. The above suggestion makes use of the dialogClass option, which appears to be on it\'s way out in favor of a new method.This worked for me:Try usingThis will hide all dialogs titlesActually there\'s yet another way to do it, using the dialog widget directly:You can get the Dialog Widget thus and then doto hide the titlebar within that dialog onlyand in a single line of code (I like chaining):No need to add an extra class to the dialog this way, just go at it directly. Workss fine for me.I find it more efficient, and more readable, to use the open event, and hide the title bar from there. I don\'t like using page-global class name searches.Simple.You can use jquery to hide titlebar after using dialogClass when initializing the dialog.during init :By using this method, you don\'t need to change your css file, and this is dynamic too.I like overriding jQuery widgets. So you can now setup if you want to show title bar or notIf you have multiple dialog, you can use this:This is the easiest way to do it and it will only remove the titlebar in that one specific dialog;The one thing I discovered when hiding the Dialog titlebar is that, even if display is none, screen readers still pick it up and will read it. If you already added your own title bar, it will read both, causing confusion. What I did was removed it from the DOM using $(selector).remove(). Now screen readers (and every one else) will not see it because it no longer exists.Try thisreplace divid by corresponding idI think the cleanest way of doing it would be to create a new myDialog widget, consisting of the dialog widget minus the title bar code. Excising the title bar code looks straightforward. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.jsThis worked for me to hide the dialog box title bar: This is How it can be done.Go  to themes folder-->  base-->  open  jquery.ui.dialog.css   Find   Followings if you don\'t want to display titleBar then simply set display:none as i did in the following.   Samilarly for title as well.Now comes close button you can also set it none or you can set itsI did lots of search but nothing then i got this idea in my mind.\nHowever this will effect entire application to don\'t have close button,title bar for dialog but you can overcome this as well by using jquery and adding and setting  css via jqueryhere is syntax for this This next form fixed me the problem.You could remove the bar with the close icon with the techinques described above and then add a close icon yourself. CSS:HTML://append this div to the div holding your contentJS: go to your jquery-ui.js (in my case jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom.js) and search for this._createTitlebar(); and comment it.now anyone of yours dialog will appear with headers. If you want to customize the header just go to _createTitlebar(); and edit the code inside.by
