Is there a way to print the runtime type of a variable in swift? For example:In the example above, I\'m looking for a way to show that the variable "soon" is of type ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional<NSDate>, or at least NSDate!.Update September 2016Swift 3.0: Use type(of:), e.g. type(of: someThing) (since the dynamicType keyword has been removed)Update October 2015:I updated the examples below to the new Swift 2.0 syntax (e.g. println was replaced with print, toString() is now String()).From the Xcode 6.3 release notes:@nschum points out in the comments that the Xcode 6.3 release notes show another way:Type values now print as the full demangled type name when used with\n  println or string interpolation.Which outputs:Update for Xcode 6.3:You can use the _stdlib_getDemangledTypeName():and get this as output:Original answer:Prior to Xcode 6.3 _stdlib_getTypeName got the mangled type name of a variable. Ewan Swick\'s blog entry helps to decipher these strings: e.g. _TtSi stands for Swift\'s internal Int type.Mike Ash has a great blog entry covering the same topic.Edit: A new toString function has been introduced in Swift 1.2 (Xcode 6.3).You can now print the demangled type of any type using .self and any instance using .dynamicType:Try calling YourClass.self and yourObject.dynamicType.Reference: https://devforums.apple.com/thread/227425.Is this what you\'re looking for?It prints "__NSDate"UPDATE: Please note this no longer seems to work as of Beta05My current Xcode is Version 6.0 (6A280e).Output:Swift 3.0As of Xcode 6.3 with Swift 1.2, you can simply convert type values into the full demangled String.You can still access the class, through className (which returns a String).There are actually several ways to get the class, for example classForArchiver, classForCoder, classForKeyedArchiver (all return AnyClass!).You can\'t get the type of a primitive (a primitive is not a class).Example:If you want to get the type of a primitive, you have to use bridgeToObjectiveC(). Example:You can use reflect to get information about object.\nFor example name of object class:I had luck with:In Swift 3.0, you can use type(of:), as dynamicType keyword has been removed.Xcode 8 Swift 3.0 use type(of:)SWIFT 3With the latest release of Swift 3 we can get pretty descriptions of type names through the String initializer. Like, for example print(String(describing: type(of: object))). Where object can be an instance variable like array, a dictionary, an Int, a NSDate, an instance of a custom class, etc.Here is my complete answer: Get class name of object as string in SwiftThat question is looking for a way to getting the class name of an object as string but, also i proposed another way to getting the class name of a variable that isn\'t subclass of NSObject. Here it is: I made a static function which takes as parameter an object of type Any and returns its class name as String :) .I tested this function with some variables like: and the output was:When using Cocoa (not CocoaTouch), you can use the className property for objects that are subclasses of NSObject. This property is not available for normal Swift objects, which aren\'t subclasses of NSObject (and in fact, there is no root id or object type in Swift).In CocoaTouch, at this time there is not a way to get a string description of the type of a given variable. Similar functionality also does not exist for primitive types in either Cocoa or CocoaTouch.The Swift REPL is able to print out a summary of values including its type, so it is possible this manner of introspection will be possible via an API in the future.EDIT: dump(object) seems to do the trick.I\'ve tried some of the other answers here but milage seems to very on what the underling object is.However I did found a way you can get the Object-C class name for an object by doing the following:Here is and example of how you would use it:In this case it will print NSDate in the console.I found this solution which hopefully might work for someone else.\nI created a class method to access the value. Please bear in mind this will work for NSObject subclass only. But at least is a clean and tidy solution.In the latest XCode 6.3 with Swift 1.2, this is the only way I found:In lldb as of beta 5, you can see the class of an object with the command:which outputs something like:The command expanded out means something like:Frame Variable (print a frame variable) -d run_target (expand dynamic types)Something useful to know is that using "Frame Variable" to output variable values guarantees no code is executed.I\'ve found a solution for self-developed classes (or such you have access to).Place the following computed property within your objects class definition:Now you can simply call the class name on your object like so:Please note that this will only work if your class definition is made within a file that is named exactly like the class you want the name of.As this is commonly the case the above answer should do it for most cases. But in some special cases you might need to figure out a different solution.If you need the class name within the class (file) itself you can simply use this line:Maybe this method helps some people out there.Based on the answers and comments given by Klass and Kevin Ballard above, I would go with:which will print out:Many of the answers here do not work with the latest Swift (Xcode 7.1.1 at time of writing).The current way of getting the information is to create a Mirror and interrogate that. For the classname it is as simple as:Additional information about the object can also be retrieved from the Mirror. See http://swiftdoc.org/v2.1/type/Mirror/ for details.There appears to be no generic way to print the type name of an arbitrary value\'s type. As others have noted, for class instances you can print value.className but for primitive values it appears that at runtime, the type information is gone. For instance, it looks as if there\'s not a way to type: 1.something() and get out Int for any value of something. (You can, as another answer suggested, use i.bridgeToObjectiveC().className to give you a hint, but __NSCFNumber is not actually the type of i -- just what it will be converted to when it crosses the boundary of an Objective-C function call.)I would be happy to be proven wrong, but it looks like the type checking is all done at compile time, and like C++ (with RTTI disabled) much of the type information is gone at runtime.Not exactly what you are after, but you can also check the type of the variable against Swift types like so:For example.Xcode 7.3.1, Swift 2.2:String(instanceToPrint.self).componentsSeparatedByString(".").lastSwift 3.0, Xcode 8With the following code you can ask an instance for its class. You can also compare two instances, wether having the same class.The top answer doesn\'t have a working example of the new way of doing this using type(of:. So to help rookies like me, here is a working example, taken mostly from Apple\'s docs here - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/2885064-typeThis is also handy when checking if an object is a type of a class:Please have a look at the below code snippet and let me know if you are looking for something like below or not.Another important aspect that influences the class name returned from String(describing: type(of: self)) is Access Control.Consider the following example, based on Swift 3.1.1, Xcode 8.3.3 (July 2017)As you can see, all classes in this example have different levels of access control which influence their String representation. In case the classes have private or fileprivate access control levels, Swift seems to append some kind of identifier related to the "nesting" class of the class in question.The result for both PrivateDemoSystemCall and FileprivateDemoSystemCall is that the same identifier is appended because they both are nested in the same parent class.I have not yet found a way to get rid of that, other than some hacky replace or regex function.Just my 2 cents.
