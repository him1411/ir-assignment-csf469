How do I checkout just one file from a git repo?As mentioned in the other answers:you can use git archive (see Jared Forsyth\'s answer and Robert Knight\'s answer), since git1.7.9.5 (March 2012):That will save a copy of \'filename\' from the HEAD of the remote repository in the current directory.The :path/to/directory part is optional. If excluded, the fetched file will be saved to <current working dir>/path/to/directory/filename.Fizer Khan mentions below specifying the tar format explicitly: It is similar to Paul Brannan\'s answer:As commented by Doron Gold,  for git archive --remote=xxx to work, you MUST first run this inside the directory of your repository on your git server (where git daemon runs): See patthoyts\' comment of 2009 Jakub Nar\xc4\x99bski\'s answer on "git: Retrieve a single file from a repository".or you must clone first the repo, meaning you get the full history:But then you can do a sparse checkout (if you are using Git1.7+),:To re-read the working tree:That way, you end up with a working tree including precisely what you want (even if it is only one file)First clone the repo with the -n option, which suppresses the default checkout of all files, and the --depth 1 option, which means it only gets the most recent revision of each fileThen check out just the file you want like so:If you already have a copy of the git repo, you can always checkout a version of a file using a git log to find out the hash-id (for example 3cdc61015724f9965575ba954c8cd4232c8b42e4) and then you simply type:Here is an actual example:git checkout branch_or_version -- path/fileexample: git checkout HEAD -- main.cNormally it\'s not possible to download just one file from git without downloading the whole repository as suggested in the first answer.\nIt\'s because Git doesn\'t store files as you think (as CVS/SVN do), but it generates them based on the entire history of the project.But there are some workarounds for specific cases. See below:GitHubIf this file is on github.com, try e.g.:GitWebIf you\'re using Git on the Server - GitWeb, then you may try in example (change it into the right path):GitWeb at drupalcode.orgExample:googlesource.comThere is an undocumented feature that allows you to download base64-encoded versions of raw files:In other cases check if your Git repository is using any web interfaces.If it\'s not using any web interface, you may consider to push your code to external services such as GitHub, Bitbucket, etc. and use it as a mirror.If you don\'t have wget installed, try curl -O (url) alternatively.Working in GIT 1.7.2.2For example you have a remote some_remote with branches branch1, branch32so to checkout a specific file you call this commands:as an example it will be something like thisThis checkout command will copy the whole file structure conf/en and conf/fr into the current directory where you call these commands (of course I assume you ran   git init at some point before)git checkout -- <filename>Ref: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkoutDup: Undo working copy modifications of one file in Git?Now we can! As this is the first result on google, I thought I\'d update this to the latest standing. With the advent of git 1.7.9.5, we have the git archive command which will allow you to retrieve a single file from a remote host.See answer in full here https://stackoverflow.com/a/5324532/290784Very simple:This will not checkout the from-branch-name branch. You will stay on whatever branch you are on, and only that single file will be checked out from the specified branch.Here\'s the relevant part of the manpage for git-checkoutHat tip to Ariejan de Vroom who taught me this from this blog post.You can do it byIn git you do not \'checkout\' files before you update them - it seems like this is what you are after.Many systems like clearcase, csv and so on require you to \'checkout\' a file before you can make changes to it. Git does not require this. You clone a repository and then make changes in your local copy of repository.Once you updated files you can do:To see what files have been modified. You add the ones you want to commit to index first with (index is like a list to be checked in):orThen do git status will show you which files were modified and which are in index ready to be commited or checked in.To commit files to your copy of repository do:See git website for links to manuals and guides.Two variants on what\'s already been given:and:These write the file to standard output.It sounds like you\'re trying to carry over an idea from centralized version control, which git by nature is not - it\'s distributed. If you want to work with a git repository, you clone it. You then have all of the contents of the work tree, and all of the history (well, at least everything leading up to the tip of the current branch), not just a single file or a snapshot from a single commit.If you only need to download the file, no need to check out with Git.GitHub Mate is much easier to do so, it\'s a Chrome extension, enables you click the file icon to download it. also open sourceSay the file name is 123.txt, this works for me:git Checkout --theirs  123.txtif the file is inside a directory A, make sure to specify it correctly:git Checkout --theirs  "A/123.txt"If you need a specific file from a specific branch from a remote Git repository the command is:The rest can be derived from @VonC\'s answer:If you need a specific file from the master branch it is:If you need a specific file from a tag it is:If you have edited a local version of a file and wish to revert to the original version maintained on the central server, this can be easily achieved using Git Extensions.Easy!
