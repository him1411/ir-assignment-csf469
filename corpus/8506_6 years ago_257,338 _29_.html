Is there a better way to get the type of a variable in JS than typeof? It works fine when you do:But it\'s useless when you try:I know of instanceof, but this requires you to know the type beforehand.    Is there a better way?Angus Croll recently wrote an interesting blog post about this -http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/fixing-the-javascript-typeof-operator/He goes through the pros and cons of the various methods then defines a new method \'toType\' -You can try using constructor.name.As with everything JavaScript, someone will eventually invariably point that this is somehow evil, so here is a link to an answer that covers this pretty well.An alternative is to use Object.prototype.toString.callA reasonably good type capture function is the one used by YUI3:This captures many of the primitives provided by javascript, but you can always add more by modifying the TYPES object. Note that typeof HTMLElementCollection in Safari will report function, but type(HTMLElementCollection) will return objectYou may find the following function useful: Or in ES7 (comment if further improvements)Results:Also we can change a little example from ipr101and call asone line function:this give the same result as jQuery.type()You can apply Object.prototype.toString to any object:This works well in all browsers, with the exception of IE - when calling this on a variable obtained from another window it will just spit out [object Object].My 2\xc2\xa2! Really, part of the reason I\'m throwing this up here, despite the long list of answers, is to provide a little more all in one type solution and get some feed back in the future on how to expand it to include more real types.With the following solution, as aforementioned, I combined a couple of solutions found here, as well as incorporate a fix for returning a value of jQuery on jQuery defined object if available. I also append the method to the native Object prototype. I know that is often taboo, as it could interfere with other such extensions, but I leave that to user beware. If you don\'t like this way of doing it, simply copy the base function anywhere you like and replace all variables of this with an argument parameter to pass in (such as arguments[0]).Then simply use with ease, like so:Note: There is 1 argument passable. If is bool of true, then the return will always be in lowercase.More Examples:If you have anything to add that maybe helpful, such as defining when an object was created with another library (Moo, Proto, Yui, Dojo, etc...) please feel free to comment or edit this and keep it going to be more accurate and precise. OR roll on over to the GitHub I made for it and let me know. You\'ll also find a quick link to a cdn min file there.In my preliminary tests, this is working pretty well. The first case will print the name of any object created with "new", and the 2nd case should catch everything else.I\'m using (8, -1) because I\'m assuming that the result is always going to start with [object and end with ] but I\'m not certain that\'s true in every scenario.
