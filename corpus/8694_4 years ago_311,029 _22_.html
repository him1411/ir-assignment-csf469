How do I use $rootScope to store variables in a controller I want to later access in another controller? For example:How would I do this?Variables set at the root-scope are available to the controller scope via prototypical inheritance.Here is a modified version of @Nitish\'s demo that shows the relationship a bit clearer:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/TmPk5/6/Notice that the rootScope\'s variable is set when the module initializes, and then each of the inherited scope\'s get their own copy which can be set independently (the change function).  Also, the rootScope\'s value can be updated too (the changeRs function in myCtrl2)Sharing data between controllers is what Factories/Services are very good for. In short, it works something like this.You can see a working example in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/mbielski/m8saa/DEMOi find no reason to do this $scope.value = $rootScope.test;$scope is already prototype inheritance from $rootScope. Please see this examplenow you can bind this scope variable in anywhere in app tag. first store the values in $rootScope as$rootScope is the parent of all $scope, each $scope receives a copy of $rootScope data which you can access using $scope itself.If it is just "access in other controller" then you can use angular constants for that, the benefit is; you can add some global settings or other things that you want to access throughout applicationand then access it like:(didn\'t test)more info: http://ilikekillnerds.com/2014/11/constants-values-global-variables-in-angularjs-the-right-way/http://astutejs.blogspot.in/2015/07/angularjs-what-is-rootscope.htmlThere are multiple ways to achieve this one:-1. Add $rootScope in .run method2. Create one service and access it in both the controllers.
