Is it possible to call a constructor from another (within the same class, not from a subclass)? If yes how? And what could be the best way to call another constructor (if there are several ways to do it)?Yes, it is possible:To chain to a particular superclass constructor instead of one in the same class, use super instead of this. Note that you can only chain to one constructor, and it has to be the first statement in your constructor body.See also this related question, which is about C# but where the same principles apply.Using this(args). The preferred pattern is to work from the smallest constructor to the largest.You can also use a more recently advocated approach of valueOf or just "of":To call a super class, use super(asdf). The call to super must be the first call in the constructor or you will get a compiler error.[Note: I just want to add one aspect, which I did not see in the other answers: how to overcome limitations of the requirement that this() has to be on the first line).]In Java another constructor of the same class can be called from a constructor via this(). Note however that this has to be on the first line.That this has to appear on the first line looks like a big limitation, but you can construct the arguments of other constructors via static methods. For example:When I need to call another constructor from inside the code (not on the first line), I usually use a helper method like this:But most often I try to do it the other way around by calling the more complex constructors from the simpler ones on the first line, to the extent possible. For the above exampleWithin a constructor, you can use the this keyword to invoke another constructor in the same class. Doing so is called an explicit constructor invocation. Here\'s another Rectangle class, with a different implementation from the one in the Objects section.This class contains a set of constructors. Each constructor initializes some or all of the rectangle\'s member variables.As everybody already have said, you use this(\xe2\x80\xa6), which is called an explicit constructor invocation.However, keep in mind that within such an explicit constructor invocation statement you may not refer toAs stated in JLS (\xc2\xa78.8.7.1).You can a constructor from another constructor of same class by using "this" keyword.\nExample -Output -\nstring as arg constructor..\nDefault constructor..\nint as arg constructor..I tel you an easy wayThere are two types of constructors:I will explain in one ExampleIn the above example I showed 3 types of callingNote:\nthis must be first statement in constructor.Yes it is possible to call on constructor from another. But there is a rule to it. If a call is made from one constructor to another, then that new constructor call must be the first statement in the current constructorSo something like below will not work.Yes it is possible to call one constructor from another with use of this()Yes, any number of constructors can be present in a class and they can be called by another constructor using this()[Please do not confuse this() constructor call with this keyword].\nthis() or this(args) should be the first line in the constructor.  This is known as constructor overloading.\nPlease note that for constructor only overloading concept is applicable and not inheritance or overriding.Calling constructor from another constructorAlso you can call parent constructor by using super() callThe keyword this can be used to call a constructor from a constructor, when writing several constructor for a class, there are times when you\'d like to call one constructor from another to avoid duplicate code.Bellow is a link that I explain other topic about constructor and getters() and setters() and I used a class with two constructors. I hope the explanations and examples help you.Setter methods or constructors
