I\'m getting this error message when trying to run my application. I don\'t know how to fix it:HTTP Error 404.3 - Not Found The page\n  you are requesting cannot be served\n  because of the extension\n  configuration. If the page is a\n  script, add a handler. If the file\n  should be downloaded, add a MIME map.Here\'s a screenshot of the error page:\nWhat can I do to fix this error?Use aspnet_regiis.exe to register version of .NET framework you are using.This is a common issue and happens when IIS is installed after VS or .NET framework.Note - for Windows 8/10 users, see the other answer by JohnOpincar below. And also the comment/tip from Kevin Brydon.In Windows 8/10, you have to use Programs and Features, Turn Windows features on or off, IIS, World Wide Web Services, Application Development Features, and check the appropriate items, such as enabling ASP.NET.In my case I needed to add MIME types for each file extension that I wanted to serve to web config:I fixed that on my Windows 10:Go to Control Panel - Programs and Features - Turn Windows features on or off.Select .NET Framework 4.6 Advanced Services - WCF ServicesCheck HTTP Activation.OK done.In case this helps anyone,  I was getting this error when attempting to run aspnet_regiis.exe:Operation failed with 0x8007000BAn attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect formatAs it turns out, the server was running 2008 64 bit and I was trying to run the 32 bit version of the utility.  Running the version found in \\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v2.0.50727 fixed the issue.I\'ve just had the same situation with my customer.  We have our own product which installs a web site. The installer configures everything: the IIS pool, the site, web.config, etc.We installed another web site using our installer.  We entered the same parameters, so web.configs happened to be the same in both sites. However, the newly installed site worked fine, while the old one didn\'t.  Then I opened 2 IIS Manager windows and started comparing the difference in web site settings. And I found a problem.Somebody deleted all the Handler Mappings with the old site. If you go to "Handler mappings", you should see there aspx, asmx and other extensions and names of the handlers. So, in the old site all those records were missing. So, I would suggest first to check the "Handler mappings" - there must be a lot of records there. Create a new web site and compare to know how many should there be.Who deleted them, a person or another program, I have no idea. If somebody can tell if there exists some tracking application which would tell that user domain\\john was modifying web site at date "07.03.2012 12:34" that would be useful.As @Mahmoodvcs mentioned i was require to set/add MIME types for the file extension that I needed to host/download directly, in this case is a Heroku\'s dump file (postgres\'s database backup), so in order to set a public IIS server where you can download this files without requiring AWS S3 bucket or HTTP shares like dropbox this is a terrific option!I fixed my issue on Windows 2012 server by Installing ALL WCF Features.A) Server Manager > Manage[link top left] > Add Roles and FeaturesB) In Features > .Net Framework 4.5 Features > WCF ServicesC) Check (enable) the features. I checked all.D) InstallRunning Windows Server 2008 R2 64bit and .net framework 4.5, ran this command from this location, and was successful:output:By the way, I\'ve just found out this post:\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/webtopics/archive/2010/03/19/iis-7-5-how-to-enable-iis-configuration-auditing.aspx\nit explains how to audit changes on IIS.  For those who face similar problems I suggest to turn on auditing and later see why your site stopped working.I too had this error, on Windows Server 2008 IIS 7, I had no visual studio installed so a reinstall / repair of .NET 4.0 did the trick.To add an extension to serve in IIS follow -I was trying to set up MediaWiki on my windows 7 pc and got this error. My solution was to "create a global FastCGI handler mapping for php".Verify that the application pool in IIS (in the case of IIS7 or above) is selected as integrated. In this case, probably change to Classic can solve this problem.Related to Server 2016, I should add:Run this command: aspnet_regiis -lv from this dir:\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\  This gives you the\nbest view of what is going onOn Server 2016, installing .net and iis out of sequence does not\nseem to be a problem.What is more likely to be a problem on Server 2016 is simply that\nasp.net is not installed on the machine.
