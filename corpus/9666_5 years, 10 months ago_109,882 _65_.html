How can I change the default port used by the play framework in development mode when issueing the "run" command on the play console.This is for playframework 2.0 beta.Using the http.port configuration parameter either on the command line or in the application.conf seems to have no effect:Change the http.port value in the conf/application.conf file or pass it command line:Play 2.x is an sbt plugin so the following commands are really just\n  sbt commands.  You can use any sbt launcher (e.g. sbt, play, or\n  activator).  The commands below use the sbt launcher but\n  you can substitute it for your sbt launcher of choice.For browser-reload mode:For continuous-reload mode:To run in debug mode with the http listener on port 8080, run:Start in Prod mode:Create a staged distribution:For Play 2.0.x and 2.1.x use the target/start script (Unix Only):For Play 2.2.x & 2.3.x use the appropriate start script in the target/universal/stage/bin directory:With Play 2.2.x & 2.3.x on Windows:To create a zip distribution:For Play 2.0.x and 2.1.x use the start script (Unix Only) in the extracted zip:For Play 2.2.x use the appropriate script in the [appname]-[version]/bin directory:With Play 2.2.x on Windows:Play 2.0-RC4It is important to include quotes around the play command you want to run. In my case without the quotes play would still run on port 9000.Alternatively you could run the following from the play console (type \'play\' to get to the console)Version 2.0.3 :Go to the project directory and just say play (and nothing after that).\nThat will open the play console.Next, say run 8080. That will start play on port 8080. I hope this helps.For Play 2.2.x on Windows with a distributable tar file I created a file in the distributable root directory called: {PROJECT_NAME}_config.txt and added:Where {PROJECT_NAME} should be replaced with the name of your project. Then started the {PROJECT_NAME}.bat script as usual in the bin\\ directory.For Play 2.3.xactivator "run -Dhttp.port=9001"You can also set the HTTP port in .sbtopts in the project directory:Then you do not have to remember to add it to the run task every time.Tested with Play 2.1.1.Play 2.2.0 on WindowsUsing a zip distribution (produced using the "dist" command), the only way I was able to change the startup port was by first setting JAVA_OPTS and then launching the application.E.g., from the command linewhere myapp.bat is the batch file created by the "dist" command.The following would always ignore my http.port parameter and attempt to start on the default port, 9000However, I\'ve noticed that this works fine on Linux/OSX, starting up on the requested port:On Windows maybe the play "run 9001" will not work. You have to change the play.bat file. See TicketIt doesn\'t work yet in the beta. Will be added in an upcoming release.With the commit introduced today (Nov 25), you can now specify a port number right after the run or start sbt commands.For instanceplay run 8080 or play start 8080Play defaults to port 9000From the play console, you just need to type run 8888, if you want to run it from port 8888.for Play 2.5.x then for play 2.5.xStep 1: Stop the netty server (if it is running) using control + DStep 2: go to sbt-dist/confStep 3: edit this file \'sbtConfig.txt\' with this Step 4: Start the server Step 5: http://host:9005/On windows, I use a start.bat file like this:The -DapplyEvolutions.default=true tells evolution to automatically apply evolutions without asking for confirmation. Use with caution on production environment, of course...Play 2.2.1 on Windows supports a PLAY_OPTS environment variable.  Play\'s play.bat file contains this line:so to run on port 9002, doTested with 2.3.7 Play framework. Works well. We cannot change the application port from the avtivator but can change from the command line  activator "~run 8080"But to run on the poet 9000 from the activator we need to stop the application which is using this port. We can use the this application to find this and end the process https://technet.microsoft.com/en-in/sysinternals/bb897437.aspx After this we can run and it will be successful.I did this. sudo is necessary.EDIT: I had problems because of using sudo so take care. Finally I cleaned up the project and I haven\'t used that trick anymore.We are using Play version 2.5.6.For changing the port, go to your project root folder and hit:\nactivator "run 8008" in command prompt / terminal.and that\'s it.
