I\'m using a SQLdatareader to build POCOs from a database. The code works except when it encounters a null value in the database. For example, if the FirstName column in the database contains a null value, an exception is thrown. What is the best way to handle null values in this situation?You need to check for IsDBNull:That\'s your only reliable way to detect and handle this situation.I wrapped those things into extension methods and tend to return a default value if the column is indeed null:Now you can call it like this:and you\'ll never have to worry about an exception or a null value again.You should use the as operator combined with the ?? operator for default values. Value types will need to be read as nullable and given a default.The as operator handles the casting including the check for DBNull.For a string you can simply cast the object version (accessed using the array operator) and wind up with a null string for nulls:orFor integers, if you cast to a nullable int, you can use GetValueOrDefault()or the  null-coalescing operator (??).IsDbNull(int) is usually much slower than using methods like GetSqlDateTime and then comparing to DBNull.Value. Try these extension methods for SqlDataReader.Use them like this:One way to do it is to check for db nulls:I don\'t think there\'s a NULL column value, when rows are returned within a datareader using the column name.If you do datareader["columnName"].ToString(); it will always give you a value that can be a empty string (String.Empty if you need to compare).I would use the following and wouldn\'t worry too much:This Solution is less vendor-dependent and works with an SQL, OleDB, and MySQL Reader:reader.IsDbNull(ColumnIndex) works as many answers says.And I want to mention if you working with column names, just comparing types may be more comfortable.Check sqlreader.IsDBNull(indexFirstName) before you try to read it.What I tend to do is replace the null values in the SELECT statement with something appropriate.Here I replace every null with a blank string. Your code won\'t throw in error in that case.I think you would want to use:You can write a Generic function to check Null and include default value when it is NULL. Call this when reading DatareaderWhen reading the Datareader useWe use a series of static methods to pull all of the values out of our data readers.  So in this case we\'d be calling DBUtils.GetString(sqlreader(indexFirstName))  The benefit of creating static/shared methods is that you don\'t have to do the same checks over and over and over...The static method(s) would contain code to check for nulls (see other answers on this page).I am using the code listed below to handle null cells in an Excel sheet that is read in to a datatable.and / or use ternary operator with assignment:replace the default (when null) value as appropriate for each property type...This method is dependent on indexFirstName which should be the zero-based column ordinal.If you don\'t know the column index but wan\'t to check a name you can use this extension method instead:And use the method like this:You may use the conditional operator:you can ever check for this as well
