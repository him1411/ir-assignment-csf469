I have this html:How can I do something like this:I tried something like this:... but it doesn\'t work. Any ideas? Thanks.The problem is that the change event fires only when focus is moved away from the input (e.g. someone clicks off the input or tabs out of it).  Try using keyup instead:This question is 2 years old but it\'s still a good question and it was the first Google result ... but all of the existing answers recommend setting and removing the HTML attribute (removeAttr("disabled")) "disabled", which is not the right approach. There is a lot of confusion regarding attribute vs. property.The "disabled" in <input type="button" disabled> in the markup is called a boolean attribute by the W3C.Quote:A property is in the DOM; an attribute is in the HTML that is parsed into the DOM.https://stackoverflow.com/a/7572855/664132Related:Nevertheless, the most important concept to remember about the checked attribute is that it does not correspond to the checked property. The attribute actually corresponds to the defaultChecked property and should be used only to set the initial value of the checkbox. The checked attribute value does not change with the state of the checkbox, while the checked property does. Therefore, the cross-browser-compatible way to determine if a checkbox is checked is to use the property...Relevant:Properties generally affect the dynamic state of a DOM element without changing the serialized HTML attribute. Examples include the value property of input elements, the disabled property of inputs and buttons, or the checked property of a checkbox. The .prop() method should be used to set disabled and checked instead of the .attr() method.To [...] change DOM properties such as the [...] disabled state of form elements, use the .prop() method.(http://api.jquery.com/attr/)As for the disable on change part of the question: There is an event called "input", but browser support is limited and it\'s not a jQuery event, so jQuery won\'t make it work. The change event works reliably, but is fired when the element loses focus. So one might combine the two (some people also listen for keyup and paste).Here\'s an untested piece of code to show what I mean:or for us that dont like to use jQ for every little thing:eric, your code did not seem to work for me when the user enters text then deletes all the text. i created another version if anyone experienced the same problem. here ya go folks:To remove disabled attribute use,and to add disabled attribute use,Enjoy :)you can also use something like this : here  is Live exampleHere\'s the solution for file input field.To disable a submit button for file field when a file is not chosen, then enable after the user chooses a file to upload: Html:If the button is itself a jQuery styled button (with .button()) you will need to refresh the state of the button so that the correct classes are added / removed once you have removed/added the disabled attribute.The answers above don\'t address also checking for menu based cut/paste events.  Below\'s the code that I use to do both.  Note the action actually happens with a timeout because the cut and past events actually fire before the change happened, so timeout gives a little time for that to happen.I had to work a bit to make this fit my use case.I have a form where all fields must have a value before submitting.Here\'s what I did:Thanks to everyone for their answers here.take look at this snippet from my projectso just disabled the button after your operation executed $(this).attr(\'disabled\', \'disabled\');Please see the below code to enable or disable Submit buttonIf Name and City fields has value then only Submit button will be enabled.Al types of solution are supplied. So I want to try for a different solution. Simply it will be more easy if you add a id attribute in your input fields. Now here is your jQuery
