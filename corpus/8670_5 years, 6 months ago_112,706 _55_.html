I am using npm v1.0.104/node 0.6.12 on ubuntu - I am receiving the error copied below while attempting to install any new modules via npm (I tested socket.io earlier using http, not https though & am wondering if that could have resulted in the issue with npm/unsigned certs).  The error pops up once npm tries to resolve the \'https://registry.npmjs.org\' URL.  Is there anyway I can ignore the error or perhaps locate/add the cert to a trusted store in order to continue using npm. Any insight on what needs to be done to resolve the issue will be appreciated (I would prefer to resolve the issue through configuration as opposed to re-installing if possible).Error:\n"Error: SSL Error: SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN" Full Message:Running the following helped resolve the issue:I cannot comment on whether it will cause any other issues at this point in time.  Hope it helps.As of February 27, 2014, npm no longer supports its self-signed certificates. The following options, as recommended by npm, is to do one of the following:Upgrade your version of npm-- OR --Tell your current version of npm to use known registrarsUpdate: npm has posted More help with SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN and npm with more solutions particular to different environments\nIt seems that people are having issues using npm\'s recommendations, so here are some other potential solutions.Upgrade Node itself\nReceiving this error may suggest you have an older version of node, which naturally comes with an older version of npm. One solution is to upgrade your version of Node. This is likely the best option as it brings you up to date and fixes existing bugs and vulnerabilities.The process here depends on how you\'ve installed Node, your operating system, and otherwise.Update npm\nBeing that you probably got here while trying to install a package, it is possible that npm install npm -g might fail with the same error. If this is the case, use update instead. As suggested by Nisanth Sojan:Update npm alternative\nOne way around the underlying issue is to use known registrars, install, and then stop using known registrars. As suggested by jnylen:For now I just switched registry URL from https to http.

You can also do a brew upgrade after updating homebrew.  Also it might be helpful to run brew doctor if you run into any other issues.  Quick and clean solution (linux tested) (After fatidic February 27, 2014)Uninstall npmInstall npm (new URL is www.npmjs.org instead npmjs.org)Tip: how to install node.js in linux https://stackoverflow.com/a/22099363/333061 The error SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN means that you have self signed certificate in certificate chain which is basically not trusted by the system.If that happens, basically something fishy is going on, therefore as people already commented, it is not recommended to just disable certificate checks, but better approach is to understand what is the problem and fix the cause of it.This maybe related either to:custom repository address which doesn\'t have the right certificate,a corporate network with transparent proxy.If you\'re behind a corporate web proxy, you should set-up the proper HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY environment variables or set them via npm:See: How to setup Node.js and Npm behind a corporate web proxyIf you trust the host, you can export the self-signed certificate from the chain and import them into system, so they\'re marked as trusted.This can be achieved by checking the certificates by (change example.com into npm repo which is failing based on the npm-debug.log):then save the certificate content (between BEGIN and END) into .crt file in order to import it.As per suggestion, you can add exported certificate into /etc/environment file (Node 7.4+), like:On CentOS 5 this can be appended into /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt file, e.g.Note: To export only first certificate, remove g at the beginning.In CentOS 6, the certificate file can be copied to /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/.In Ubuntu/Debian, copy CRT file into /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/  then run:In macOS you can run:In Windows: certutil -addstore -f "ROOT" new-root-certificate.crtSee also: npm - Troubleshooting - SSL ErrorUninstall NPM and install it again.As of February 27, 2014 npm no longer supports its self-signed certificates.\nhttp://blog.npmjs.org/post/78085451721/npms-self-signed-certificate-is-no-moreThe link above suggests upgrading NPM using NPM. This also fails with SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN...Turning off SSL seems like a profoundly bad idea. npm\'s blog explains that they no longer support their self-signed cert. They suggest upgrading npm via npm install npm -g, but I of course got the same SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN error. So I just updated node, which updated npm along with it. Exact procedure depends on how you installed node in the first place.
