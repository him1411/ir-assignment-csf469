I have configured my Apache by myself and have tried to load phpMyAdmin on a virtual host, but I received:403 Forbidden You don\'t have permission to access / on this serverMy httpd.confand vhosts.conf:4 years ago, since this answer is used as a reference by many, and while I learned a lot from security perspective during these years,\nI feel I am responsible to clarify some important notes, and I\'ve update my answer accordingly.The original answer is correct but not safe for some production environments, \nin addition I would like to explain some issues that you might fall into while setting up your environment.If you are looking for a quick solution and SECURITY IS NOT A MATTER, i.e development env, skip and read the original answer insteadMany scenarios can lead to 403 Forbidden:When you access a directory and there is no default file found in this directory\nAND Apache Options Indexes is not enabled for this directory.DirectoryIndex index.html default.php welcome.phpIf set, apache will list the directory content if no default file found (from the above \xf0\x9f\x91\x86\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb option)You will receive a 403 ForbiddenMentioned by @Radu, @Simon A. Eugster in the comments\nYou request is denied, blacklisted or whitelisted by those directives. I will not post a full explanation, but I think some examples may help you understand,\n in short remember this rule:IF MATCHED BY BOTH, THE LAST IS WILL WINDeny will win if matched by both directives (even if an allow directive is written after the deny in the conf)allow will win if matched by both directivesOnly localhost and *.mydomain.com can access this, all other hosts are deniedAll requests are denied, the last line may trick you, but remember that if matched by both the last win rule (here Deny is the last), same as written: Requests are accepted from all hostsApache 2.4 use a new module called mod_authz_host Require all granted => Allow all requests Require all denied => Deny all requestsRequire host safe.com => Only from safe.com are allowedOne thing that most people do it wrong is configuring files permissions,  The GOLDEN RULE is STARTS WITH NO PERMISSION AND ADD AS PER YOUR NEED In linux:Directories should have the Execute permissionFiles should have the Read permissionYES, you are right DO NOT ADD Execute permission for filesfor instance, I use this script to setup the folders permissionsI posted this code as an example, setup may vary in other situations I faced the same issue, but I solved it by setting the options directive either in the global directory setting in the httpd.conf or in the specific directory block in httpd-vhosts.conf:By default, your global directory settings is (httpd.conf line ~188):set the options to :\nOptions Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGIFinally, it should look like:Also try changing Order deny,allow and Allow from all lines  by Require all granted.I understand this issue is resolved but I happened to solve this same problem on my own.The cause of Forbidden You don\'t have permission to access / on this serveris actually the default configuration for an apache directory in httpd.conf.Simply changing Deny from all to Allow from all should solve the permission problem.Alternatively, a better approach would be to specify individual directory permissions on virtualhost configuration. As of Apache-2.4, however, access control is done using the new module mod_authz_host (Upgrading to 2.4 from 2.2). Consequently, the new Require directive should be used.A common gotcha for directories hosted outside of the default /var/www/ is that the Apache user doesn\'t just need permissions to the directory and subdirectories where the site is being hosted.  Apache requires permissions to all the directories all the way up to the root of the file system where the site is hosted.  Apache automatically gets permissions assigned to /var/www/ when it\'s installed, so if your host directory is directly underneath that then this doesn\'t apply to you.  Edit: Daybreaker has reported that his Apache was installed without correct access permissions to the default directory.For example, you\'ve got a development machine and your site\'s directory is:You may think you can get away with:because this gives Apache permissions to access your site\'s directory?  Well that\'s correct but it\'s not sufficient.  Apache requires permissions all the way up the directory tree so what you need to do is:Obviously I would not recommend giving access to Apache on a production server to a complete directory structure without analysing what\'s in that directory structure.  For production it\'s best to keep to the default directory or another directory structure that\'s just for holding web assets.Edit2: as u/chimeraha pointed out, if you\'re not sure what you\'re doing with the permissions, it\'d be best to move your site\'s directory out of your home directory to avoid potentially locking yourself out of your home directory.Some configuration parameters have changed in Apache 2.4. I had a similar issue when I was setting up a Zend Framework 2 application. After some research, here is the solution:Incorrect ConfigurationCorrect ConfigurationIf you are planning to migrate from Apache 2.2 to 2.4, here is a good reference: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.htmlWith Apache 2.2 With Apache 2.4From http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/upgrading.htmlIf you are using a WAMP server then try this:Single click on the WAMP server icon at the taskbarSelect the option put onlineYour server will restart automaticallyThen try to access your localwebsiteOn Ubuntu 14.04 using Apache 2.4, I did the following:Add the following in the file, apache2.conf (under /etc/apache2):and reload the server:Edit: This also works on OS X Yosemite with Apache 2.4. The all-important line is Require all grantedI solved my problem by adding my user to httpd.conf.This article Creating virtual hosts on Apache 2.2 helps me (point 9) permissions to the top virtual hosts directory.I simply add this lines to my vhosts.conf file:If you are using CentOS with SELinux Try:See more: https://www.centos.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6834#p31548I was getting the same error and couldn\'t figure out the problem for ages. If you happen to be on a Linux distribution that includes SELinux such as CentOS, you need to make sure SELinux permissions are set correctly for your document root files or you will get this error. This is a completely different set of permissions to the standard file system permissions.I happened to use the tutorial Apache and SELinux, but there seems to be plenty around once you know what to look for.If you are using MAMP Pro the way to fix this is by checking the Indexes checkbox under the Hosts - Extended tab.  In MAMP Pro v3.0.3 this is what that looks like:\nThere is another way to solve this problem. Let us say you want to access directory "subphp" which exist at /var/www/html/subphp, and you want to access it using 127.0.0.1/subphp and you receive error like this:You don\'t have permission to access /subphp/ on this server.Then change the directory permissions from "None" to "access files". A command-line user can use the chmod command to change the permission.I use Mac OS X, in my case, I just forget to enable php in apache, all I need to do is to uncomment one line from /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:ref this article for detail.I had the same issue, but due to the fact that I changed the path on apache to a folder outside var/www, I started running into problems.I fixed it by creating a symlink in var/www/html > home/dev/project which seemed to do the trick, without having to change any permissions...I ran into this problem, and my solution was moreso that www-data didn\'t own the proper folders, and instead I set it for one of the users to own it. (I was trying to do a bit of fancy, but erroneous trickery to get ftp to play nicely.)After running:The machine started serving data again. You can see who currently owns the folder by means of I just want to change my public directory www, and access it from my PC, and mobile connected by Wifi. I\'ve Ubuntu 16.04.So, first, I modified /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf \nand I changed the line DocumentRoot /var/www/html\nfor my new public directory\nDocumentRoot "/media/data/XAMPP/htdocs"Then I modified /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, and I put the permissions for localhost, and my mobile, this time I used the IP address, I know it is not completely safe, but it\'s OK for my purposes. < Directory />< /Directory>I had the same issue for a specific controller only - which was really weird. I had a folder in the root of the CI folder that had the same name as the controller I was trying to access... Because of that, CI was directing the request to this directory instead of the controller itself.After removing this folder (which was there a bit by mistake), it all worked fine.To be more clear, here is what it looked like:I had to remove /ci/register/.Check exactly where you are putting your files, don\'t nest them in the Documents folder.  For instance I made the mistake of putting my code in the Documents folder of as mentioned this isn\'t going to work because Documents is explicitly only available to YOU and not APACHE.  Try moving it up one directory and you may not see this issue.Move folder from:/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/codeTo here:\n/Users/YOURUSERNAME/codeJust to bring another contribution as I ran to this problem too:I had a VirtualHost configured that I did not want to. I have commented out the line where the include for the vhost occured, and it worked.(In Windows and Apache 2.2.x)The "Forbidden" error is also the result of not having virtual hosts defined.As noted by Julien, if you intend to use virtual hosts.conf, then go to the httpd file and uncomment the following line:Then add your virtual hosts definitions in conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf and restart Apache.You can change youralias.conf file like this code:I had this issue when using SSHFS to mount the files in my VirtualBox guest from my local filesystem before running a docker build. In the end, the "fix" was to copy all the files to the VirtualBox instance rather than building from inside the SSHFS mount, and then run the build from there.WORKING Method (unless there is no other problem)By default, Apache is not restricting access from IPv4 (common external IP address)What are restricted are the commands given in \'httpd.conf\'.Replace allwithhence removing out all restriction given to Apache.Replace Require local with Require all granted for the C:/wamp/www/ directory.Try this and don\'t add anything Order allow,deny and others: After changing the configuration files don\'t forget to Restart All Services.I wasted three hours of my time on it.This is pretty ridiculous, but I got the 403 Forbidden when the file I was trying to download wasn\'t there on the filesystem. The apache error is not very accurate in this case, and the whole thing worked after I simply put the file where it was supposed to be.We had modsec enabled, check the site\'s error log for an modsec ID then enter a locationmatch for the file in the vhost (or .htaccess I guess):Just to add another potential gotcha to this growing list, my problem (running CentOS 6.8) was with a particular virtualhost which worked fine on a different server, the issue turned out to be a faulty .htaccess file using mod_rewrite:In .htaccess, this caused a 403 error:\n\n    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n    RewriteEngine On \n    RewriteBase /\n    </IfModule>\nAdding FollowSymLinks as the first line fixed the issue:\n\n    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n    Options +FollowSymLinks\n    RewriteEngine On \n    RewriteBase /\n    </IfModule>\nPermissions errorSome very noob users like me face this problem when having incorrect permissions set in a page (in particular, that "other" users do not have read permissions). For example, say you are attempting to access index.html, and you get the above error. To fix, type:and then upload to server again. Error disappears.
