Did anybody have similar problem with this, I import android project and I get \nerrors like I got errors to delete all @Override above functions. I have Windows 7 x64, jvm7 x64. Does anyone have clue what is wrong ?( I done Android Tools -> Fix Project Properties but didn;t help )That isn\'t the problem, Jack. Android SDK isn\'t x64, but works ok with x64 jvm (and x64 eclipse IDE).As helios said, you must set project compatibility to Java 5.0 or Java 6.0.To do that, 2 options: Go to the project folder and right click on it -> properties -> check off the read only box and click okRight-click on your project and select "Android Tools -> Fix Project Properties" Right-click on your project and select "Properties -> Java Compiler", check "Enable project specific settings" and select 1.5 or 1.6 from "Compiler compliance settings" select box. (try all the levels one by one just in case)Under Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Compiler, set Compiler compliance level to 1.6 or 1.5.Hopefully it will settle the problem.I would recommend using x86 version of jvm. When I first got my new laptop (x64), I wanted to go x64 all the way (jvm, jdk, jre, eclipse, etc..). But once I finished setting everything up I realized that the Android SDK wasn\'t x64, so I had issues. Go back to x86 jvm and you should be ok.EDIT: 11/14/13I\'ve seen some recent activity and figured I would elaborate a little more.I did not say it would not work with x64, I just recommended using x86.Here is a good post on the advantages / disadvantages of x64 JDK. Benefits of 64bit Java platformThought process: To what end? Why am I trying to using 64 bit JDK? Just because I have a 64-bit OS? Do I need any of the features of 64-bit JDK? Are there any extra features in the 64-bit JDK?! Why won\'t this s*** play nice together!? F*** it I\'m going 32-bit.Doing Project -> Clean... fixed it for me.My eclipse had stopped working so I cleaned workspace directory and after I run eclipse when I import the project I had this problem. Other solutions suggested here didn\'t work.For most of the people still receiving the error after fixing project properties, you probably installed Java 7 SDK when setting up your environment, but it is not currently supported for Android development.As the error message sais, you should have installed Java 5.0 or 6.0, but Java 7 was found.If you fix project properties without first installing Java 5 or 6, you will see the same error again.And then:OR I agree with BMSAndroidDroid and Flo-Scheild-Bobby. I was doing a tutorial called DailyQuote and had used the Cordova library. I then changed my OS from Windows to Ubuntu and tried to import projects into Eclipse, (I\'m using Eclipse Juno 64-bit, on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, Oracle JDK 7. I also installed the Ubuntu 32-bit libs- so no issues with 64 and 32bit), and got the same issue.As suggested by Flo-Scheild-Bobby, open configure build path and add the jar(s) again that you added before. Then remove the old jar link(s) and thats it.I fixed this problem employing the two procedures of :In Eclipse->\'Project\' menu -> \'Java Compiler\' -> set \'Compiler compliance level\' = 1.6\ncheck on \'Use default compliance settings\'\nSet \'Generated .class compatibility\' = 1.6\nSet \'Source compatibilty\' = 1.6Then go to \'Windows\' menu --> \'Preferences\' -->\'Java\' , expand \'Java\' --> \'Compiler\' -->Set \'Compiler compliance level\' = 1.6Hint: Source compatibility must be equal to or less than compliance level.I would suggest that u check for the jar files are properly included in your projects. There are possibility that in absence of jar files, the project will not be compiledAs BMSAndroidDroid said, this problem may be caused by a wrong build path configuration.If you included some libraries to your build path, then move the libraries, the build path will conserve the wrong references, will not found the libraries during compilation and you will get an error.To fix it, right click on your project folder > build path > configure build path\nThen take a look to the library tab, and remove the old libraries.In my case a switch from openjdk7 to openjdk6 helped. Afterwards I changed the compliance level to 1.6 and all compiled fine.i come across this problem cause my debug.keystore is expired, so i deleted the debug.keystore     under .android folder, and the eclipse will regenerate a new debug.keystore, then i fixed thFollowing worked for meHow can you do that?In your Eclipse Package Explorer 3rd click on your project and select properties. Properties Window will open. Select Java Compiler on the left panel of the window. Now Enable project specific settings and set the Complier compliance level to 1.6. Select Apply and then OK.
