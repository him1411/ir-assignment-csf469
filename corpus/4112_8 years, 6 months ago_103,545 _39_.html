I am currently using TortoiseHg (Mercurial) and accidentally committed an incorrect commit message. How do I go about editing this commit message in the repository?Update: Mercurial has added --amend which should be the preferred option now.You can rollback the last commit (but only the last one) with hg rollback and then reapply it.Important: this permanently removes the latest commit (or pull). So if you\'ve done a hg update that commit is no longer in your working directory then it\'s gone forever. So make a copy first.Other than that, you cannot change the repository\'s history (including commit messages), because everything in there is check-summed. The only thing you could do is prune the history after a given changeset, and then recreate it accordingly.None of this will work if you have already published your changes (unless you can get hold of all copies), and you also cannot "rewrite history" that include GPG-signed commits (by other people).Well, I used to do this way:Imagine, you have 500 commits, and your erroneous commit message is in r.498.Good news: hg 2.2 just added git like --amend option.and in tortoiseHg, you can use "Amend current revision" by select black arrow on the right of  commit button I know this is an old post and you marked the question as answered. I was looking for the same thing recently and I found the histedit extension very useful. The process is explained here:http://knowledgestockpile.blogspot.com/2010/12/changing-commit-message-of-revision-in.htmlTo change the commit message of the last commit when the last mercurial operation was a commit you can useto roll back the last commit and re-commit it with the new message:But be careful because the rollback command also rolls back following operations:(see hg help rollback)Thus, if you are not sure if the last mercurial command was a hg ci, don\'t use hg rollback.You can use the mq extension, which is distributed with Mercurial, to change the commit message of any commit.This approach is only useful when there aren\'t already cloned repositories in the public that contain the changeset you want to rename because doing so alters the changeset hash of it and all following changesets.That means that you have to be able to remove all existing clones that include the changeset you want to rename, or else pushing/pulling between them wouldn\'t work.To use the mq extension you have to explicitly enable it, e.g. under UNIX check your ~/.hgrc, which should contain following lines:Say that you want to change revision X - first qimport imports revisions X and following. Now they are registered as a stack of applied patches. Popping (qpop) the complete stack except X makes X available for changes via qrefresh. After the commit message is changed you have to push all patches again (qpop) to re-apply them, i.e. to recreate the following revisions. The stack of patches isn\'t needed any, thus it can be removed via qfinish.Following demo script shows all operations in action. In the example the commit message of third changeset is renamed.Copy it to an empty directory an execute it e.g. via:The output should include the original changeset message:And the rename operation the changed message:(Tested with Mercurial 1.7.5)In TortoiseHg, right-click on the revision you want to modify. Choose Modify History->Import MQ. That will convert all the revisions up to and including the selected revision from Mercurial changesets into Mercurial Queue patches. Select the Patch you want to modify the message for, and it should automatically change the screen to the MQ editor. Edit the message which is in the middle of the screen, then click QRefresh. Finally, right click on the patch and choose Modify History->Finish Patch, which will convert it from a patch back into a change set.Oh, this assumes that MQ is an active extension for TortoiseHG on this repository. If not, you should be able to click File->Settings, click Extensions, and click the mq checkbox. It should warn you that you have to close TortoiseHg before the extension is active, so close and reopen.As others have mentioned the MQ extension is much more suited for this task, and you don\'t run the risk of destroying your work. To do this:I\'m not familiar with TortoiseHg, but the commands should be similar to those above. I also believe it\'s worth mentioning that editing history is risky; you should only do it if you\'re absolutely certain that the changeset hasn\'t been pushed to or pulled from anywhere else.Rollback-and-reapply is realy simple solution, but it can help only with the last commit. Mercurial Queues is much more powerful thing (note that you need to enable Mercurial Queues Extension in order to use "hg q*" commands).I did it this way.  Firstly, don\'t push your changes or you are out of luck.  Grab and install the collapse extension.  Commit another dummy changeset.  Then use collapse to combine the previous two changesets into one.  It will prompt you for a new commit message, giving you the messages that you already have as a starting point.  You have effectively changed your original commit message.One hack i use if the revision i want to edit is not so old:Let\'s say you\'re at rev 500 and you want to edit 497.Edit rev497 file and change the message. (It\'s after first lines preceded by "#")There is another approach with the MQ extension and the debug commands. This is a general way to modify history without losing data. Let me assume the same situation as Antonio.A little gem in the discussion above - thanks to @Codest and @Kevin Pullin. \nIn TortoiseHg, there\'s a dropdown option adjacent to the commit button. Selecting "Amend current revision" brings back the comment and the list of files. SO useful.
