I have a  server side function that requires login. If the user is logged in the function will return 1 on success. If not, the function will return the login-page.I want to call the function using Ajax and jQuery. What I do is submit the request with an ordinary link, with a click-function applied on it. If the user is not logged in or the function fails, I want the Ajax-call to return true, so that the href triggers. However, when I use the following code, the function exits before the Ajax call is done.How can I redirect the user gracefully to the loginpage?If you don\'t want the $.ajax() function to return immediately, set the async option to false:But, I would note that this would be counter to the point of AJAX. Also, you should be handling the response in the error and success functions. Those functions will only be called when the response is received from the server.I am not using $.ajax but the $.post and $.get functions, so if I need to wait for the response, I use this:The underlying XMLHttpRequest object (used by jQuery to make the request) supports the\nasynchronous property. Set it to false. Like Instead of setting async to false which is usually bad design, you may want to consider blocking the UI while the operation is pending.This can be nicely achieved with juery promises as follows:with this you can now do:And the UI will block until the ajax command returnssee jsfiddleI think things would be easier if you code your success function to load the appropriate page instead of returning true or false.For example instead of returning true you could do:That way when the success function is called the page gets redirected.
