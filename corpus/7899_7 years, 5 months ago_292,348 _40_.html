I always read about this funny weight value in the Android documentations. \nNow I want to try it for the first time but it isn\'t working at all. As I understand it from the documentations this layout: should create two buttons that are horizontally aligned and share the space equally. The problem is the two buttons don\'t grow to fill the space. I would like the buttons to grow and fill the whole line. If both buttons are set to match parent only the first button is shown and fills the whole line. You are not setting the layout_weight property. Your code reads weight="1" and it should read android:layout_weight="1".3 things to remember:Example:And the result:It\'s android:layout_weight. Weight can only be used in LinearLayout. If the orientation of linearlayout is Vertical, then use android:layout_height="0dp" and if the orientation is horizontal, then use android:layout_width = "0dp". It\'ll work perfectly.This image summarizes the Linear layout.You can follow this link for more information on the topic. http://www.cheezycode.com/2015/10/just-maths-views-view-groups-and-layouts.htmlVideo Tutorial For Linear Layout : Width, Height & WeightsAndroid Linear Layout TutorialTry setting the layout_width of both buttons to "0dip" and the weight of both buttons to 0.5LinearLayout supports assigning a weight to individual children. This attribute assigns an "importance" value to a view, and allows it to expand to fill any remaining space in the parent view. Default weight is zero calculation to assign any Remaining/Extra space between child. (not the total space) space assign to child = (child individual weight) / (sum of weight of every child in Linear Layout) Example (1): \nif there are three text boxes and two of them declare a weight of 1, while the third one is given no weight (0), then Remaining/Extra space assign to Example (2) : let\'s say we have a text label and two text edit elements in a horizontal row. The label has no layout_weight specified, so it takes up the minimum space required to render. If the layout_weight of each of the two text edit elements is set to 1, the remaining width in the parent layout will be split equally between them (because we claim they are equally important). If the first one text box has a layout_weight of 1 and the second text box has a layout_weight of 2, then one third of the remaining space will be given to the first, and two thirds to the second (because we claim the second one is more important). In the width field of button, replace wrap-content with 0dp.\nUse layout_weight attribute of a view.This is how your code will look like:      layout_weight is used to distribute the whatever left space into proportions.   In this case, the two buttons are taking "0dp" width. So, the remaining space will be divided into 1:1 proportion among them, i.e. the space will be divided equally between the Button Views.Like answer of @Manoj SeelanReplace android:layout_weight With android:weight. When you use Weight with LinearLayout. you must add weightSum in LinearLayout and according to orientation of your LinearLayout you  must setting 0dp for Width/Height to all LinearLayout`s Children viewsExample :If The orientation of Linearlayout is Vertical , then Set Width of all LinearLayout`s Children views with 0dpIf the orientation Linearlayout of is horizontal , then Set Height of all LinearLayout`s Children views with 0dp.Perhaps setting both of the buttons layout_width properties to "fill_parent" will do the trick.I just tested this code and it works in the emulator:Be sure to set layout_width to "fill_parent" on both buttons.In the above XML, set the android:layout_weight of the linear layout as 2:\n android:layout_weight="2"Plus you need to add this android:layout_width="0dp" for children views [Button views] of LinerLayout You have to write like this its Working for me    This is perfect answer of your problemSubstitute wrap_content with fill_parent.
