I have seen prefix N in some insert T-SQL queries. Many people have used N before inserting the value in a table.I searched, but I was not able to understand what is the purpose of including the N before inserting any strings into the table.It\'s declaring the string as nvarchar data type, rather than varcharYou may have seen Transact-SQL code that passes strings around using\n  an N prefix. This denotes that the subsequent string is in Unicode\n  (the N actually stands for National language character set). Which\n  means that you are passing an NCHAR, NVARCHAR or NTEXT value, as\n  opposed to CHAR, VARCHAR or TEXT.To quote from Microsoft:Prefix Unicode character string constants with the letter N. Without\n  the N prefix, the string is converted to the default code page of the\n  database. This default code page may not recognize certain characters.If you want to know the difference between these two data types, see this SO post:What is the difference between varchar and nvarchar?Assuming the value is nvarchar type for that only we are using N\'\'
