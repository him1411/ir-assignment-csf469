I\'m trying to create an element dynamically using an HTML string.  Here\'s a simple example using both prototype and DOM:Both approaches insert an empty listitem to the list.I know that using prototype\'s Element as a constructor requires a tagName and an optional attributes parameter, but I figured it may let me pass in an HTML string too.However, MSDN states "You can also specify all the attributes inside the createElement method by using an HTML string for the method argument."... so I\'m not sure what the problem is.And yes, i know i could do this easily in jquery, unfortunately we\'re not using jquery.  Am i overlooking something really simple here?Should be obvious, but the link to that MSDN article is regarding an IE only feature.Generally the following cross-browser trick is what all the libraries do to get DOM elements from an HTML string (with some extra work for IE for <td>s, <tr>s, <thead>s, <select>s and more):Or var element = div.firstChild if you know you\'re getting a single root node.I would recommend you stick to the library-approved method of creating elements from HTML strings though. Prototype has this feature built-into its update() method.HTML 5 introduces the <template> element which can be used for this purpose (spec, MDN docs).A <template> is an HTML element which is allowed any other element type as a child. The template has a .content property that you can access with JavaScript which points to a DocumentFragment with the template\'s contents. This means that you can convert a HTML string to DOM elements by setting the innerHTML of a <template> element, then reaching into the template\'s .content property.Examples:Note that similar approaches that use a different container element such as a div don\'t quite work. HTML has restrictions on what element types are allowed to exist inside which other element types; for instance, you can\'t put a td as a direct child of a div. This causes these elements to vanish if you try to set the innerHTML of a div to contain them. Since <template>s have no such restrictions on their content, this shortcoming doesn\'t apply when using a template.However, template is reasonably new and support is still a little flaky. As of February 2016, Can I Use estimates 71% of users are using a browser that supports templates. In particular, no version of Internet Explorer supports them; Microsoft did not implement template support until the release of Edge.If you\'re lucky enough to be writing code that\'s only targeted at users on modern browsers, go ahead and use them right now. Otherwise, you may have to wait a while for users to catch up.Newer DOM implementations have range.createContextualFragment, which does what you want in a framework-independent way.It\'s widely supported. To be sure though, check its compatibility down in the same MDN link, as it will be changing. As of May 2017 this is it:Heres a simple way to do it:With Prototype, you can also do:HTML:JS:Here\'s my code, and it works:No need for any tweak, you got a native API:You can create valid DOM nodes from a string using:document.createRange().createContextualFragment()The following example adds a button element in the page taking the markup from a string:Late but just as a note;It\'s possible to add a trivial element to target element as a container and remove it after using.// Tested on chrome 23.0, firefox 18.0, ie 7-8-9 and opera 12.11.For certain html fragments like <td>test</td>, div.innerHTML, DOMParser.parseFromString and range.createContextualFragment (without the right context) won\'t create the <td> element.jQuery.parseHTML() handles them (I extracted jQuery 2\'s parseHTML function into an independent gist).For Edge 13+, use the template tag:I am using this method (Works in IE9+), although it will not parse <td> or some other invalid direct childs of body:For the heck of it I thought I\'d share this over complicated but yet simple approach I came up with... Maybe someone will find something useful.You can try this dom-builder to construct html elements from your js codeYou can use the following function to convert the text "HTML" to the elementI added a Document prototype that creates an element from string:Use jneratorIf your javascript relies on jQuery then use append. Example:Corresponding jQuery APIThis will work too:It feels more like a jquery way with the chained function calls.
