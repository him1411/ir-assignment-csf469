I want to create a category on UIColor in my app using Xcode 6. But the thing is that in Xcode 6 there is no Objective-C category file template. Is there any option to create a category in Xcode 6?They didn\'t forget. They just moved it without telling anyone.Click File -> New -> FileSelect Objective-C file under Sources in iOS or Mac OS respectively and Click NextNow under File Type: choose either Category, Protocol, or ExtensionPS. Under File Name: whatever you type here will be either the Category, Protocol, or Extension Name.To create CategoryBaseClass+CategoryName.m/.h: Here\'s a visual demonstration:Xcode6-Beta5 updateThe interface has now changed and it\'s possible to add a Category directly from the New > File window.See unmircea\'s answer.I was surprised myself, and I guess because of Swift they forgot about good old Objective-C.You have two options:Create an Objective-C class with the category name, example UIView+Powerups, then manually change the interface to match the one of category. Note that the snippet for the category interface and implementation is still working, so that\'s extra easy: type @interface-category and @implementation-category.Import it from Xcode 5! Use this command:Close and reopen Xcode 6 and you\'ll find "Objective-C Category" in the wizard for the new file.There is no predefined template to create category in Xcode 6 beta(for time being),they may add this option later. As a work around you can create a Cocoa Touch Class(its not proper i know but no other way) named UIImage+Additions(ClassName+CategoryName) and override its interface and implementation some thing like Edit\nThis answer was written before finding a way of creating category in the Xcode 6 beta. Check unmircea\'s answer for the right way of creating categoryExtending unmircea\'s fantastic answer re: how to create a custom category to implement a custom UIColor palette, you could create a category.Once you\'ve created your category (in this example, it\'s a category called ColorPalette of class UIColor), you\'ll have a header and an implementation file.UIColor+ColorPalette.h UIColor+ColorPalette.m To use your custom color palette, just import the header into the class where you\'d like to implement your custom colors:and call the color as you would a standard color like redColor, greenColor, or blueColor.Here\'s a link to a slightly more in-depth discussion of creating a custom palette.Additionally, here is a tool to help you select the custom color valuesYou could just copy the templates you want from an older version of Xcode, I made a shell script for this:https://github.com/cDigger/AddMissingTemplates
