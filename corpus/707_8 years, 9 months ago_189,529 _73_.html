Path.Combine is handy, but is there a similar function in the .NET framework for URLs?I\'m looking for syntax like this:which would return:"http://MyUrl.com/Images/Image.jpg"Uri has a constructor that should do this for you: new Uri(Uri baseUri, string relativeUri)Here\'s an example:You use Uri.TryCreate( ... ) :Will return:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.uri.trycreate.aspxThis may be a suitably simple solution:There\'s already some great answers here. Based on mdsharpe suggestion, here\'s an extension method that can easily be used when you want to deal with Uri instances:And usage example:This will produce http://example.com/subpath/part1/part2This question got some great, highly voted answers!Ryan Cook\'s answer is close to what I\'m after and may be more appropriate for other developers. However, it adds http:// to the beginning of the string and in general it does a bit more formatting than I\'m after.  Also, for my use cases, resolving relative paths is not important. mdsharp\'s answer also contains the seed of a good idea, although that actual implementation needed a few more details to be complete. This is an attempt to flesh it out (and I\'m using this in production):C#VB.NetThis code passes the following test, which happens to be in VB:Based on the sample URL you provided, I\'m going to assume you want to combine URLs that are relative to your site.Based on this assumption I\'ll propose this solution as the most appropriate response to your question which was: "Path.Combine is handy, is there a similar function in the framework for URLs?"Since there the is a similar function in the framework for URLs I propose the correct is: "VirtualPathUtility.Combine" method.\nHere\'s the MSDN reference link: VirtualPathUtility.Combine MethodThere is one caveat: I believe this only works for URLs relative to your site (that is, you cannot use it to generate links to another web site. For example, var url = VirtualPathUtility.Combine("www.google.com", "accounts/widgets");).Path.Combine does not work for me because there can be characters like "|" in QueryString arguments and therefore the Url, which will result in an ArgumentException.I first tried the new Uri(Uri baseUri, string relativeUri) approach, which failed for me because of Uri\'s like http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:SpecialPages:will result in Special:SpecialPages, because of the colon after Special that denotes a scheme.So I finally had to take mdsharpe/Brian MacKays route and developed it a bit further to work with multiple uri parts:Usage: CombineUri("http://www.mediawiki.org/", "wiki", "Special:SpecialPages")I just put together small Extension methodcan be used like this:Witty example, Ryan, to end with a link to the function. Well done.One recommendation Brian: if you wrap this code in a function, you may want to use a UriBuilder to wrap the base URL prior to the TryCreate call.Otherwise, the base URL MUST include the scheme (where the UriBuilder will assume http://). Just a thought:Combining multiple parts of a Url could be a little bit tricky. You can use the 2 parameter constructor  Uri(baseUri, relativeUri), or you can use Uri.TryCreate() utility function. Either cases, you might end up returning an incorrect result because these methods keep on truncating the relative parts off of the first parameter baseUri, i.e. from something like http://google.com/some/thing to http://google.comTo be able to combine multiple parts into a final url, you can copy the 2 functions below:Full code with unit tests to demonstrate usage could be found at https://uricombine.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#UriCombine/Uri.csI have Unit Tests to cover the 3 most common cases:\nI know this has been answered, but an easy way to combine them and ensure it\'s always correct is..This answer will probably got lost in all the answers above, but I found UriBuilder worked really well for this sort of thing.See UriBuilder Class - MSDN for more constructors and documentation.My generic solution:i know i am late to the party, but i created this function that will make your life easier it works for URLs as well as normal pathsUsage : I know this question is well answered, however i find this useful as it has the following featuresNote : The Class name Url could be changed, as there is a system class System.Security.Policy.UrlClassResultsHere\'s Microsoft\'s (OfficeDev PnP) method UrlUtility.Combine:Source: GitHubHow about this?Here is my approach and I will use it for myself tooHas the benefits of behaving exactly like Path.CombineMore suggestions...\nI have combined all the above:Well, I just concatenate two strings and use Regular Expressions to do the cleaning part.So, you can use like this:Hope it can be useful for someone!I used this code to solve the problem:Rules while combining URL\'s with URITo avoid strange behaviour there\'s one rule to follow:If you follow rules above, you can combine URLs with code below. Depending on your situation, you can add multiple \'directory\' parts to url...Both of these workOrieif baseUrl = "http://tesrurl.test.com/Int18"andrelativePath = "To_Folder"output = http://tesrurl.test.com/Int18/To_FolderSome errors will appear for code belowI have to point out that Path.Combine appears to work for this also directly atleast on .NET4I haven\'t used the following code yet, but found it during my internet travels to solve a URL combine problem - hoping it\'s a succinct (and successful!) answer:
