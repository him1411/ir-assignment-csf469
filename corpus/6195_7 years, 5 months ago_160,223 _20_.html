I have one of my activities which I would like to prevent from rotating because I\'m starting an AsyncTask, and screen rotation makes it restart.Is there a way to tell this activity "DO NOT ROTATE the screen even if the user is shaking his phone like mad"?Add android:screenOrientation="portrait" to the <activity> element/s in\nthe manifest or landscape and you\'re done.You can follow the logic below to prevent auto rotate screen while your AsyncTask is running:Please note that there are several ways to access Activity (which runs on UI thread) properties inside an AsyncTask.

So basically this is the tip of the spear.The following attribute on the ACTIVITY in AndroidManifest.xml is all you need:So, the full activity node would be:Add:If you are using Android Developer Tools (ADT) and Eclipse\nyou can go to your AndroidManifest.xml --> Application tab --> go down and select your activity. Finally, select your preferred orientation.\nYou can select one of the many options.You have to add the following code in the manifest.xml file.\nThe activity for which it should not rotate, in that activity add this elementThen  it will not rotate.
