I would like to access my $scope variable in Chrome\'s JavaScript console. How do I do that?I can neither see $scope nor the name of my module myapp in the console as variables.Pick an element in the HTML panel of the developer tools and type this in the console:In WebKit, $0 is a reference to the selected DOM node in the elements tab, so by doing this you get the selected DOM node scope printed out in the console.You can also target the scope by element ID, like so:Addons/ExtensionsThere are some very useful Chrome extensions that you might want to check out:Batarang. This has been around for a while.ng-inspector. This is the newest one, and as the name suggests, it allows you to inspect your application\'s scopes.Playing with jsFiddleWhen working with jsfiddle you can open the fiddle in show mode by adding /show at the end of the URL. When running like this you have access to the angular global. You can try it here:http://jsfiddle.net/jaimem/Yatbt/showjQuery LiteIf you load jQuery before AngularJS, angular.element can be passed a jQuery selector. So you could inspect the scope of a controller withOf a button... and so on.You might actually want to use a global function to make it easier:Now you could do thisCheck here: http://jsfiddle.net/jaimem/DvRaR/1/show/To improve on jm\'s answer...Or if you\'re using jQuery, this does the same thing...Another easy way to access a DOM element from the console (as jm mentioned) is to click on it in the \'elements\' tab, and it automatically gets stored as $0.If you have installed BatarangThen you can just write:when you have the element selected in the elements view in chrome. \nRef - https://github.com/angular/angularjs-batarang#consoleSomewhere in your controller (often the last line is a good place), putIf you want to see an inner/implicit scope, say inside an ng-repeat, something like this will work.Then in your controllerNote that above we define the showScope() function in the parent scope, but that\'s okay... the child/inner/implicit scope can access that function, which then prints out the scope based on the event, and hence the scope associated with the element that fired the event.@jm-\'s suggestion also works, but I don\'t think it works inside a jsFiddle.  I get this error on jsFiddle inside Chrome:This is a way of getting at scope without Batarang, you can do:Or if you want to find your scope by controller name, do this:After you make changes to your model, you\'ll need to apply the changes to the DOM by calling:I agree the best is Batarang with it\'s $scope after selecting an object (it\'s the same as angular.element($0).scope() or even shorter with jQuery: $($0).scope() (my favorite))Also, if like me you have you main scope on the body element, a $(\'body\').scope() works fine.One caveat to many of these answers: if you alias your controller your scope objects will be in an object within the returned object from scope().For example, if your controller directive is created like so: \n<div ng-controller="FormController as frm">\nthen to access a startDate property of your controller, you would call angular.element($0).scope().frm.startDateJust assign $scope as a global variable. Problem solved.We actually need $scope more often in development than in production.Mentioned already by @JasonGoemaat but adding it as a suitable answer to this question.I usually use jQuery data() function for that:The $0 is currently selected item in chrome DOM inspector.\n$1, $2 .. and so on are previously selected items.Inspect the element, then use this in the consoleTo add and enhance the other answers, in the console, enter $($0) to get the element. If it\'s an Angularjs application, a jQuery lite version is loaded by default.  If you are not using jQuery, you can use angular.element($0) as in:To check if you have jQuery and the version, run this command in the console:If you have inspected an element, the currently selected element is available via the command line API reference $0. Both Firebug and Chrome have this reference.However, the Chrome developer tools will make available the last five elements (or heap objects) selected through the properties named $0, $1, $2, $3, $4 using these references.  The most recently selected element or object can be referenced as $0, the second most recent as $1 and so on.Here is the Command Line API reference for Firebug that lists it\'s references.$($0).scope() will return the scope associated with the element. You can see its properties right away.Some other things that you can use are: $($0).scope().$parent. $($0).scope().$parent.$parent$($0).scope().$root$($0).isolateScope()See Tips and Tricks for Debugging Unfamiliar Angularjs Code for more details and examples.I\'ve used angular.element($(".ng-scope")).scope(); in the past and it works great. Only good if you have only one app scope on the page, or you can do something like: angular.element($("div[ng-controller=controllerName]")).scope(); or angular.element(document.getElementsByClassName("ng-scope")).scope();Say you want to access the scope of the element likeYou could use the following in the console: This will give you the scope at that element.Put a breakpoint in your code at a somewhere close to a reference to the $scope variable (so that the $scope is in the current \'plain old JavaScript\' scope). Then your can inspect the $scope value in the console.Just define a JavaScript variable outside the scope and assign it to your scope in your controller:That\'s it! It should work in all browsers (tested at least in Chrome and Mozilla).It is working, and I\'m using this method.
