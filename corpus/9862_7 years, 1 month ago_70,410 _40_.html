I imported a Maven project and it used Java 1.5 even though I have 1.6 configured as my Eclipse default Preferences->Java->Installed JREs. When I changed the Maven project to use the 1.6 JRE it still had the build errors left over from when the project was using Java 1.5 (I described these build errors earlier in: I have build errors with m2eclipse but not with maven2 on the command line - is my m2eclipse misconfigured?)I\'m going to delete the project and try again but I want to make sure this time that it uses Java 1.6 from the start to see if this eliminates the build problems.How do I make sure the project uses Java 1.6 when I import it?The m2eclipse plugin doesn\'t use Eclipse defaults, the m2eclipse plugin derives the settings from the POM. So if you want a Maven project to be configured to use Java 1.6 settings when imported under Eclipse, configure the maven-compiler-plugin appropriately, as I already suggested:If your project is already imported, update the project configuration (right-click on the project then Maven V Update Project Configuration).I wanted to add something to the answer already provided. maven-compiler-plugin by default will compile your project using Java 1.5 which is where m2e get\'s its information.That\'s why you have to explicitly declare the maven-compiler-plugin in your project with something other then 1.5. Your effective pom.xml will implicitly use the default set in the maven-compiler-plugin pom.xml.I added this to my pom.xml below the project description and it worked:Your JRE was probably defined in run configuration. Follow these steps in Eclipse to change the build JRE. 1) Right click on the project and select Run As > Run Configurations2) From Run Configurations window, select your project build configuration on the left panel. On the right, you will see various tabs: Main, JRE, Refresh, Source,...3) Click on JRE tab, you should see something like this4) By default, Work Default JRE (The JRE you select as default under Preferences->Java->Installed JREs) will be used. If you want to use another installed JRE, tick the Alternate JRE checkbox and select your preferred JRE from the dropdown.Here is the root cause of java 1.5:Also note that at present the default source setting is 1.5 and the default target setting is 1.5, independently of the JDK you run Maven with. If you want to change these defaults, you should set source and target.Reference : Apache Mavem Compiler PluginFollowing are the details:Plain pom.xml Following plugin is taken from an expanded POM version(Effective POM),This can be get by this command from the command line C:\\mvn help:effective-pom I just put here a small snippet instead of an entire pom.Even here you don\'t see where is the java version defined, lets dig more...Download the plugin, Apache Maven Compiler Plugin \xc2\xbb 3.1 as its available in jar and open it in any file compression tool like 7-zipTraverse the jar and findout plugin.xmlfile inside folder maven-compiler-plugin-3.1.jar\\META-INF\\maven\\Now you will see the following section in the file,Look at the above code and find out the following 2 linesGood luck.One more possible reason if you are using Tycho and Maven to build bundles, that you have wrong execution environment (Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment) in the manifest file (manifest.mf) defined. For example:In my case everything else was ok. The compiler plugins (normal maven and tycho as well) were set correctly, still m2 generated old compliance level because of the manifest. I thought I share the experience.One more place where this can go wrong is in the project specific settings, in Eclipse.project properties: click your project and one of the following:click on "Java Compiler"Because of client requirements we had them enabled to keep our projects in 1.6. When it was needed to upgrade to 1.7, we had a hard time because we needed to change the java version all over the place:I found that my issue was someone committed the file .project and .classpath that had references to Java1.5 as the default JRE.  By closing the project, removing the files, and then re-importing as a Maven project, I was able to properly set the project to use workspace JRE or the relevant jdk without it reverting back to 1.5 .  Thus, avoid checking into your SVN the .project and .classpath filesHope this helps others.
