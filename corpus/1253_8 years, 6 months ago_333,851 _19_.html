I have a table:Now I want to make the columns user, email, address unique (together).How do I do this in MySql?I have a MySQL table:and the UNIQUE KEY works just as expected, it allows multiple NULL rows of id_box_elements and id_router. I am running MySQL 5.1.42, so probably there was some update on the issue discussed above. Fortunately it works and hopefully it will stay that way.Multi column unique indexes do not work in MySQL if you have a NULL value in row as MySQL treats NULL as a unique value and at least currently has no logic to work around it in multi-column indexes. Yes the behavior is insane, because it limits a lot of legitimate applications of multi-column indexes, but it is what it is... As of yet, it is a bug that has been stamped with "will not fix" on the MySQL bug-track...Have you tried this ?

Add a unique index to one of the columns. Expand the Indexes list on the bottom of the structure page to see the unique index you just added. Click the edit icon, and in the following dialog you can add additional columns to that unique index.MySql 5 or higher behaves like this (I\'ve just tested):Example:\nPRODUCT_NAME, PRODUCT_VERSION\n\'glass\', null\n\'glass\', null\n\'wine\', 1Now if you try to insert (\'wine\' 1) again it will report a constraint violation\nHope this helpsFor adding unique index following are required:1) table_name\n2) index_name\n3) columns on which you want to add index  In your case we can create unique index as follows:If you want to avoid duplicates in future. Create another column say id2. Now add the unique on two columns:
