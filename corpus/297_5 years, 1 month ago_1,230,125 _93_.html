I\'d like to round at most 2 decimal places, but only if necessary.Input:Output:How can I do this in JavaScript? Use Math.round(num * 100) / 100If the value is a text type:If the value is a number:There is a downside that values like 1.5 will give "1.50" as the output. A fix suggested by @minitech:It seems like Math.round is a better solution. But it is not! In some cases it will NOT round correctly:toFixed() also will NOT round correctly in some cases (tested in Chrome v.55.0.2883.87)!Examples:I guess, this is because 1.555 is actually something like float 1.55499994 behind the scenes.Solution 1 is to use a script with required rounding algorithm, for example:https://plnkr.co/edit/uau8BlS1cqbvWPCHJeOy?p=previewSolution 2 is to avoid front end calculations and pull rounded values from the backend server.You can useI found this over on MDN. Their way avoids the problem with 1.005 that was mentioned.MarkG\'s answer is the correct one.  Here\'s a generic extension for any number of decimal places.Usage:Unit test:One can use .toFixed(NumberOfDecimalPlaces).None of the answers found here is correct. @stinkycheeseman asked to round up, you all rounded the number.To round up, use this:A precise rounding method. Source: MozillaExamples:Consider .toFixed() and .toPrecision():http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/formatnumber.shtmlThis question is complicated.Suppose we have a function, roundTo2DP(num), that takes a float as an argument and returns a value rounded to 2 decimal places. What should each of these expressions evaluate to?The \'obvious\' answer is that the first example should round to 0.01 (because it\'s closer to 0.01 than to 0.02) while the other two should round to 0.02 (because 0.0150000000000000001 is closer to 0.02 than to 0.01, and because 0.015 is exactly halfway between them and there is a mathematical convention that such numbers get rounded up).The catch, which you may have guessed, is that roundTo2DP cannot possibly be implemented to give those obvious answers, because all three numbers passed to it are the same number. IEEE 754 binary floating point numbers (the kind used by JavaScript) can\'t exactly represent most non-integer numbers, and so all three numeric literals above get rounded to a nearby valid floating point number. This number, as it happens, is exactly0.01499999999999999944488848768742172978818416595458984375which is closer to 0.01 than to 0.02.You can see that all three numbers are the same at your browser console, Node shell, or other JavaScript interpreter. Just compare them:So when I write m = 0.0150000000000000001, the exact value of m that I end up with is closer to 0.01 than it is to 0.02. And yet, if I convert m to a String...... I get 0.015, which should round to 0.02, and which is noticeably not the 56-decimal-place number I earlier said that all of these numbers were exactly equal to. So what dark magic is this?The answer can be found in the ECMAScript specification, in section 7.1.12.1: ToString applied to the Number type. Here the rules for converting some Number m to a String are laid down. The key part is point 5, in which an integer s is generated whose digits will be used in the String representation of m:let n, k, and s be integers such that k \xe2\x89\xa5 1, 10k-1 \xe2\x89\xa4 s < 10k, the Number value for s \xc3\x97 10n-k is m, and k is as small as possible. Note that k is the number of digits in the decimal representation of s, that s is not divisible by 10, and that the least significant digit of s is not necessarily uniquely determined by these criteria.The key part here is the requirement that "k is as small as possible". What that requirement amounts to is a requirement that, given a Number m, the value of String(m) must have the least possible number of digits while still satisfying the requirement that Number(String(m)) === m. Since we already know that 0.015 === 0.0150000000000000001, it\'s now clear why String(0.0150000000000000001) === \'0.015\' must be true.Of course, none of this discussion has directly answered what roundTo2DP(m) should return. If m\'s exact value is 0.01499999999999999944488848768742172978818416595458984375, but its String representation is \'0.015\', then what is the correct answer - mathematically, practically, philosophically, or whatever - when we round it to two decimal places?There is no single correct answer to this. It depends upon your use case. You probably want to respect the String representation and round upwards when:On the other hand, you probably want to respect the binary floating point value and round downwards when your value is from an inherently continuous scale - for instance, if it\'s a reading from a sensor.These two approaches require different code. To respect the String representation of the Number, we can (with quite a bit of reasonably subtle code) implement our own rounding that acts directly on the String representation, digit by digit, using the same algorithm you would\'ve used in school when you were taught how to round numbers. Below is an example which respects the OP\'s requirement of representing the number to 2 decimal places "only when necessary" by stripping trailing zeroes after the decimal point; you may, of course, need to tweak it to your precise needs.Example usage:The function above is probably what you want to use to avoid users ever witnessing numbers that they have entered being rounded wrongly.(As an alternative, you could also try the round10 library which provides a similarly-behaving function with a wildly different implementation.)But what if you have the second kind of Number - a value taken from a continuous scale, where there\'s no reason to think that approximate decimal representations with fewer decimal places are more accurate than those with more? In that case, we don\'t want to respect the String representation, because that representation (as explained in the spec) is already sort-of-rounded; we don\'t want to make the mistake of saying "0.014999999...375 rounds up to 0.015, which rounds up to 0.02, so 0.014999999...375 rounds up to 0.02".Here we can simply use the built-in toFixed method. Note that by calling Number() on the String returned by toFixed, we get a Number whose String representation has no trailing zeroes (thanks to the way JavaScript computes the String representation of a Number, discussed earlier in this answer).Here is a simple way to do it:You might want to go ahead and make a separate function to do it for you though:Then you would simply pass in the value.You could enhance it to round to any arbitrary number of decimals by adding a second parameter.Try this light weight solution:There are a couple of ways to do that. For people like me, the Lodash\'s variantUsage:If your project uses jQuery or lodash, you can also find proper round method in the libraries.I removed the variant n.toFixed(2), because it is not correct. Thank you @avalanche1MarkG and Lavamantis offered a much better solution than the one that has been accepted. It\'s a shame they don\'t get more upvotes!Here is the function I use to solve the floating point decimals issues also based on MDN. It is even more generic (but less concise) than Lavamantis\'s solution:Use it with:Compared to Lavamantis\'s solution, we can do...toFixed(2) here 2 is number of digits upto which we want to round this num.This may help you:for more information, you can have a look at this linkMath.round(num) vs num.toFixed(0) and browser inconsistenciesEasiest way:+num.toFixed(2)It converts it to a string, and then back into an integer / float.Here is a prototype method:If you happen to already be using the d3 library, they have a powerful number formatting library: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/FormattingRounding specifically is here: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Formatting#d3_roundIn your case, the answer is:One way to achieve such a rounding only if necessary is to use Number.prototype.toLocaleString():This will provide exactly the output you expect, but as strings. You can still convert those back to numbers if that\'s not the data type you expect.It may work for you,to know the difference between toFixed and round. You can have a look at Math.round(num) vs num.toFixed(0) and browser inconsistencies.You should use:No one seems to be aware of Number.EPSILON.Also it\'s worth noting that this is not a JavaScript weirdness like some people stated.That is simply the way floating point numbers works in a computer. Like 99% of programming languages, JavaScript doesn\'t have home made floating point numbers; it relies on the CPU/FPU for that. A computer uses binary, and in binary, there isn\'t any numbers like 0.1, but a mere binary approximation for that. Why? For the same reason than 1/3 cannot be written in decimal: its value is 0.33333333... with an infinity of threes.Here come Number.EPSILON. That number is the difference between 1 and the next number existing in the double precision floating point numbers. That\'s it: There is no number between 1 and 1 + Number.EPSILON.This is the simplest, more elegant solution (and I am the best of the world;):If you are using lodash library, you can use the round method of lodash like following.Eg: To not deal with many 0s, use this variant:Use this function Number(x).toFixed(2);I\'ll add one more approach to this..toFixed(2) returns a string with exactily 2 decimal points, that may or may not be trailing zeros. Doing a parseFloat() will eliminate those trailing zeros.Here is the shortest and complete answer:This also takes care of the example case 1.005 which will return 1.01.To round at decimal positions pos (including no decimals) do Math.round(num * Math.pow(10,pos)) / Math.pow(10,pos)Try to use the jQuery .number plug-in:
