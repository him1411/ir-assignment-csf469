I followed these instructions to the letter, including the part about password caching. It seems like the instructions are wrong, because every time I git push origin master I get this error:... at which point I am forced to enter my username and password. After doing so, I am presented with the same error message again, followed by the output from git push.Here is the contents of my .gitconfig file:To be clear, after I installed Git and ran Git Bash, here is exactly what I typed:Please help. This is so frustrating!From a blog I found:"This [git-credential-cache] doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work for Windows systems as git-credential-cache communicates through a Unix socket."Since msysgit has been superseded by Git for Windows, using Git for Windows is now the easiest option. Some versions of the Git for Windows installer (e.g. 2.7.4) have a checkbox during the install to enable the Git Credential Manager. Here is a screenshot: The wincred helper was added in msysgit 1.8.1. Use it as follows:First, download git-credential-winstore and install it in your git bin directory.Next, make sure that the directory containing git.cmd is in your Path environment variable. The default directory for this is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\cmd on a 64-bit system or C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd on a 32-bit system. An easy way to test this is to launch a command prompt and type git. If you don\'t get a list of git commands, then it\'s not set up correctly.Finally, launch a command prompt and type:Or you can edit your .gitconfig file manually:Once you\'ve done this, you can manage your git credentials through Windows Credential Manager which you can pull up via the Windows Control Panel.Looks like git now comes with wincred out-of-the-box on Windows (msysgit):Reference:\nhttps://github.com/msysgit/git/commit/e2770979fec968a25ac21e34f9082bc17a71a780I faced this problem while using AptanaStudio3 on windows7. This helped me:Code taken from hereThere is now a much easier way to setup Git password caching by double clicking a small exe on Windows. The program is still based on git-credential-winstore mentioned by the top voted answer, although the project has been moved from GitHub to http://gitcredentialstore.codeplex.com/You can download the exe (and a binary for Mac) from this blog post: https://github.com/blog/1104-credential-caching-for-wrist-friendly-git-usageFirst run git config --global credential.helper wincredThen go to: CONTROL PANEL\\CREDENTIAL MANAGER\\WINDOWS CREDENTIAL\\GENERIC CREDENTIALthen click in add a credential in Internet or network address:\n add git:https://{username}.github.comUser: {name}Password: {Password}For the sake of others who come on this issue, I had this same problem in Ubuntu (namely that my passwords weren\'t caching, despite having set the option correctly, and getting the error git: \'credential-cache\' is not a git command.), until I found out that this feature is only available in Git 1.7.9 and above.Being on an older distribution of Ubuntu (Natty; I\'m a stubborn Gnome 2 user) the version in the repo was git version 1.7.4.1.  I used the following PPA to upgrade:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~git-core/+archive/ppaFor the sake of others having this issue - I landed here because I tried to get cute with how I set up a new github repository, but per the setup page credential helper doesn\'t work unless you clone a repository."Tip: The credential helper only works when you clone an HTTPS repository URL. If you use the SSH repository URL instead, SSH keys are used for authentication. This guide offers help generating and using an SSH key pair."First find the version you are using for GIT.using this command : git --versionif you have a newer version than 1.7.10.Then simply use this this command.Reference
